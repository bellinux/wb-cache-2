[Purpose] To {{explore the}} {{differences}} in bilateral trunk muscle activation between chronic stroke pa-tients and healthy controls, this study investigated the symmetry index and cross-correlation of trunk muscles during trunk flexion and extension movements. This study also assessed {{the differences in}} trunk reposition error between groups and the association between trunk reposition error and bilateral trunk muscle activation. [Subjects and Methods] Fifteen stroke patients and 15 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects participated. Bilateral trunk muscle activations were collected by electromyography during trunk flexion and <b>extension.</b> <b>Trunk</b> reposition errors in trunk flexion and extension directions were recorded by a Qualisys motion capture system. [Results] Compared with the healthy controls, the stroke patients presented lower symmetrical muscle activation of the bilateral internal oblique and lower cross-correlation of abdominal muscles during trunk flexion, and lower symmetry index and cross-correlation of erector spinae in trunk extension. They also showed a larger trunk extension reposition error. A smaller trunk reposition error was associated with higher cross-correlation of bilateral trunk muscles during trunk movements in all subjects. [Conclusion] Trunk muscle function during symmetrical trunk movements and trunk reposition sense were impaired in the chronic stroke patients, and trunk position sense was associated with trunk muscle functions.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the activity levels of the thoracic and lumbar extensor muscles during different extension exercise modalities in healthy individuals. Therefore, 14 subjects performed four different types of extension exercises in prone position: dynamic <b>trunk</b> <b>extension,</b> dynamic-static <b>trunk</b> <b>extension,</b> dynamic leg extension, and dynamic-static leg extension. Pre- and post-exercise muscle {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} scans from the latissimus dorsi, the thoracic and lumbar parts of the longissimus, iliocostalis, and multifidus were performed. Differences in water relaxation values (T 2 -relaxation) before and after exercise were calculated (T 2 -shift) as a measure of muscle activity and compared between extension modalities. Linear mixed-model analysis revealed higher lumbar extensor activity during <b>trunk</b> <b>extension</b> compared with leg extension (T 2 -shift of 5. 01 ms and 3. 55 ms, respectively) and during the dynamic-static exercise performance compared with the dynamic exercise performance (T 2 -shift of 4. 77 ms and 3. 55 ms, respectively). No significant differences in the thoracic extensor activity between the exercises could be demonstrated. During all extension exercises, the latissimus dorsi was the least activated compared with the paraspinal muscles. While all extension exercises are equivalent effective to train the thoracic muscles, <b>trunk</b> <b>extension</b> exercises performed in a dynamic-static way are the most appropriate to enhance lumbar muscle strength...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} possible relationships between activities of the individual muscles of the ventrolateral abdominal wall {{and the development of}} pressure within the abdominal cavity. Intra‐muscular activity was recorded bilaterally from transversus abdominis, obliquus internus, obliquus externus and rectus abdominis with fine‐wire electrodes guided into place using real‐time ultrasound. Intra‐abdominal pressure was measured intragastrically using a micro tip pressure transducer. Six males were studied during loading and movement tasks with varied levels of intra‐abdominal pressure. During both maximal voluntary isometric trunk flexion and extension, transversus abdominis activity and intra‐abdominal pressure remained constant, while all other abdominal muscles showed a marked reduction during extension. When maximal isometric trunk flexor or extensor torques were imposed upon a maximal Valsalva manoeuvre, transversus abdominis activity and intra‐abdominal pressure remained comparable within and across conditions, whereas obliquus internus, obliquus externus and rectus abdominis activities either markedly increased (flexion) or decreased (<b>extension).</b> <b>Trunk</b> twisting movements showed reciprocal patterns of activity between the left and right sides of transversus abdominis, indicating an ability for torque development. During trunk flexion‐extension, transversus abdominis showed less distinguished changes of activity possibly relating to a general stabilizing function. In varied pulsed Valsalva manoeuvres, changes in peak intra‐abdominal pressure were correlated with mean amplitude electromyograms of all abdominal muscles, excluding rectus abdominis. It is concluded that the coordinative patterns shown between the muscles of the ventrolateral abdominal wall are task specific based upon demands of movement, torque and stabilization. It appears that transversus ahdominis is the abdominal muscle whose activity is most consistently related to changes in intra‐abdominal pressure...|$|E

The subjects of this study were 236 boys and 218 girls enrolled in the fifth grade at four elementary schools, and were followed up to the sixth grade. The Sports-test was conducted in order to measure physical fitness consisted of grip strength, trunk <b>extension,</b> <b>trunk</b> flexion, side step, 20 m shuttle run, 50 m run, standing broad jump, and softball throw. Health practices, included sleep in moderation, eating breakfast, playing TV games, exercise after school hours, and taking lessons in various sports, were assessed by self-administrated questionnaires. After adjusting for baseline physical fitness and growth velocity, there was a few significant difference in change in physical fitness by category of change in health practices.

40|$|Background: It is {{theorized that}} the {{development}} of the ability to stabilize the trunk may improve the performance of a judoka because it improves body balance control and optimizes force transmission from the lower extremities to the upper limbs. However, {{there is a lack of}} scientific evidence to establish a clear relationship between trunk stability and performance in judo. Aim: The purpose of this study was to determine whether the quantification of trunk stability and muscular strength and endurance allowed differentiation between national level (n = 7) and international level judoka (n = 6). In addition, the relationship between trunk stability and muscular strength and endurance of the muscles involved in trunk stability control was analyzed. Method: To assess trunk stability, trunk responses to sudden loads applied by a pneumatic mechanism were analyzed, as well as trunk postural control through an unstable sitting paradigm. Muscular strength and endurance were assessed via a flexion and <b>extension</b> <b>trunk</b> test using an isokinetic dynamometer. Results/Conclusions: International level judokas showed lower CoP displacement in the most complex task in unstable seat (7. 00 ± 1. 19 vs 8. 93 ± 1. 45 mm, T =. 025) and higher absolute and relative peak torque in extensor muscles (7. 05 ± 0. 87 vs 5. 74 ± 0. 72 Nm, T =. 013) than national level judoka. According to these results, core stability and trunk muscular condition are important qualities in the physical training of elite judoka. Correlational analysis found no relation between the analyzed variables, thus muscular strength and endurance appear to have a non-significant effect on performance in the trunk stability tests. </p...|$|E
40|$|Swimming {{performance}} in males {{is superior to}} that in females at college level. It is supposed that this phenomenon {{is based on the}} developmental differences of various physical factors between males and females. The present study was designed to examine the sexual differences of physique, musclar strength, flexibility, neuromuscular function, cardio-respiratory function and elementary swimming skill in 245 well-trained college male and female swimmers. The main findings are summarized as follows: 1) Physique elements except of body fat, muscular strength, neuromuscular function besides agility of the legs, and cardio-respiratory function were found to be significhnt 1 y superior in male swimmers as compared with female swimmers. In contrast, flexibility except of trunk rotation in female swimmers was much greater than that in male swimmers. Concerning elementary swimming skill, skills of under water swim and direction change swim c 1 osely related to speed were significantly better in male swimmers, although floating skill closely to related buoyancy was significantly better in female swimmers. From examining of the above-findings, it is inferred that major factors which produced the sexual difference of swimming performance were based on the developmental difference of muscular strength and cardio-respiratory function. 2) Swimmers seemed to possess superior abilities such as physique, muscular endurance, flexibility, and lung capacity as compared with their non-swimmers of same age level. 3) In analyzing different swimming strokes, it seemed that the sexual differences of physique aspects (i. e., body linearity, both girth, and lean body mass) were greater in individual medley stroke, but smaller in breast stroke. Concerning crawl and back strokes, significant differences between male and female swimmers were found in flexibility of trank <b>extension,</b> <b>trunk</b> lateral flexion, and so forth. And it seemed that the developmental balance of flexibility of each physical joint was different between male and female swimmers in every swimming stroke. Significant differences between male and female were also shown only in butterfly and individual strokes for glide skill, and in every stroke except of butterfly for treading water skill. The sexual differences of these skills appeared to be different in each swimming stroke...|$|E
40|$|Background: Back {{extension}} {{exercises are}} often used in the rehabilitation of low back pain. However, at present {{it is not clear}} how the posterior muscles are recruited during different types of extension exercises. Therefore, the present study will evaluate the myoelectric activity of thoracic, lumbar and hip extensor muscles during different extension exercises in healthy persons. Based on these physiological observations we will make recommendations regarding the use of extensions exercises in clinical practice. Methods. Fourteen healthy subjects performed four standardized <b>extension</b> exercises (dynamic <b>trunk</b> <b>extension,</b> dynamic-static <b>trunk</b> <b>extension,</b> dynamic leg extension, dynamic-static leg extension) in randomized order at an intensity of 60 % of 1 -RM (one repetition maximum). Surface EMG signals of Latissimus dorsi (LD), Longissimus thoracis pars thoracic (LTT) and lumborum (LTL), Iliocostalis lumborum pars thoracic (ILT) and lumborum (ILL), lumbar Multifidus (LM) and Gluteus Maximus (GM) were measured during the various exercises. Subsequently, EMG root mean square values were calculated and compared between <b>trunk</b> and leg <b>extension</b> exercises, as well as between a dynamic and dynamic-static performance using mixed model analysis. During the dynamic exercises a 2 second concentric contraction was followed by a 2 second eccentric contraction, whereas in the dynamic-static performance, a 5 second isometric interval was added in between the concentric and eccentric contraction phase. Results: In general, the muscles of the posterior chain were recruited on a higher level during <b>trunk</b> <b>extension</b> (mean ± SD, 56. 6 ± 30. 8 %MVC) compared to leg extension (47. 4 ± 30. 3 %MVC) (p ≤ 0. 001). No significant differences were found in mean muscle activity between dynamic and dynamic-static performances (p = 0. 053). The thoracic muscles (LTT and ILT) were recruited more during <b>trunk</b> <b>extension</b> (64. 9 ± 27. 1 %MVC) than during leg extension (54. 2 ± 22. 1 %MVC) (p = 0. 045) without significant differences in activity between both muscles (p = 0. 138). There was no significant differences in thoracic muscle usage between the dynamic or dynamic-static performance of the extension exercises (p = 0. 574). Lumbar muscle activity (LTT, ILL, LM) was higher during <b>trunk</b> <b>extension</b> (70. 6 ± 22. 2 %MVC) compared to leg extension (61. 7 ± 27. 0 %MVC) (p = 0. 047). No differences in myoelectric activity between the lumbar muscles could be demonstrated during the extension exercises (p = 0. 574). During each exercise the LD (19. 2 ± 13. 9 %MVC) and GM (28. 2 ± 14. 6 %MVC) were recruited significantly less than the thoracic and lumbar muscles. Conclusion: The recruitment of the posterior muscle chain during different types of extension exercises was influenced by the moving body part, but not by the type of contraction. All muscle groups were activated at a higher degree during <b>trunk</b> <b>extension</b> compared to leg extension. Based on the recruitment level of the different muscles, all exercises can be used to improve the endurance capacity of thoracic muscles, however for improvement of lumbar muscle endurance leg extension exercises seem to be more appropriate.

The {{aim of this study}} was to quantify the continuous interaction of the hip and lumbar spine kinematics and temporal characteristics as a function of direction during the task of trunk bending backwards and returning to the upright position in healthy young subjects. The sagittal hip and lumbar spine kinematics during the extension task were examined in 18 healthy male subjects. Five trials of <b>trunk</b> <b>extension</b> were recorded for each subject and paired t-tests were then used to determine significant differences (P <  0. 05) between the mean lumbar and the hip time-normalized kinematic and temporal variables. The data from the full cycle of <b>trunk</b> <b>extension</b> was analyzed with respect to movement initiation, time to reach peak velocity and peak angular displacement during the full cycle of <b>trunk</b> <b>extension.</b> Three distinct phases of movements were identified based on the continuous movement trajectories of velocity and angular displacement in the lumbar spine and hip; that of extension, return and, a terminal overcorrection phase. There were significant differences identified in the respective mean peak angular velocities of the lumbar spine (21. 7  ±  8. 6, 37. 0  ±  14. 7, 8. 3  ±  5. 0  deg/s) when compared with those of hip (14. 6  ±  6. 1, 21. 7  ±  8. 5, 5. 4  ±  3. 5  deg/s) in each of these three phases. The lumbar spine initiated the movement of <b>trunk</b> <b>extension</b> when bending backwards and returning to the upright position significantly early than that of the hip. These results highlight that in normal healthy adults there is the tendency for the lumbar spine to dominate over the hip during the task of backward trunk bending in terms of the amount and velocity of movement.

Objective. To investigate the effect of lumbar muscle pain on muscle activity of the trunk muscles using muscle functional magnetic resonance imaging. Summary of Background Data. Changed muscle recruitment in patients has an important impact on the etiology and recurrence of low back pain. The mechanisms of these changes in muscle activity are still poorly understood. An experimental study investigating the cause-effect relationship of muscle pain on muscle recruitment patterns can help to clarify these mechanisms. Methods. In 15 healthy subjects, the muscle activity of the lumbar multifidus, lumbar erector spinae, and psoas muscles was investigated with muscle functional magnetic resonance imaging. Measurements at rest and after <b>trunk</b> <b>extension</b> exercise at 40 % of repetition maximum were performed without and with induced pain. Results. The lumbar multifidus and lumbar erector spinae were significantly active during the <b>trunk</b> <b>extension</b> exercise, whereas the psoas showed no significant activity. The activity of the lumbar multifidus, lumbar erector spinae, and psoas muscles, was reduced bilaterally and multilevel during the exercise with unilateral low back muscle pain. Conclusion. These data demonstrate that unilateral muscle pain can cause hypoactivity of muscles during <b>trunk</b> <b>extension</b> at 40 % of the repetition maximum.

Methods: Using back dynamometers, 87 healthy volunteers performed three maximum voluntary isometric <b>trunk</b> <b>extensions</b> (MVC's), an isometric <b>trunk</b> <b>extension</b> at 80 % MVC, and 25 cyclic, dynamic <b>trunk</b> <b>extensions</b> at 50 % MVC. Dynamic testing was performed with the trunk angular displacement ranging from 0 ° to 40 ° and the trunk angular velocity set at 20 °/s. SEMG data was recorded bilaterally from the iliocostalis lumborum at L 1, the longissimus dorsi at L 2, and the multifidus muscles at L 5. The initial value and slope of the root mean square (RMS-SEMG) and the instantaneous median frequency (IMDF-SEMG) estimates derived from the SEMG recorded during each exercise cycle were used to {{investigate the}} differences in MU control marking the eccentric vs. the concentric portions of the exercise. Results: During the concentric portions of the exercise, the initial RMS-SEMG values were almost twice those observed during the eccentric portions of the exercise. The RMS-SEMG values generally increased during the concentric portions of the exercise while they mostly remained unchanged during the eccentric portions of the exercise with significant differences between contraction types. Neither the initial IMDF-SEMG values nor the time-course of the IMDF-SEMG values significantly differed between the eccentric and the concentric portions of the exercise. Conclusions: The comparison of the investigated SEMG parameters revealed distinct neural control strategies during the eccentric vs. the concentric portions of the cyclic exercise.

Biomechanical studies on lumbar back supports often use electromyography (EMG) {{to assess the}} aect on trunk muscle activity. However, the lumbar back support may alter the electromyographic signal by changing the electrode–muscle distance. Methods. Subjects performed <b>trunk</b> <b>extensions</b> at three static submaximal extension moment levels (25 %, 50 % and 75 % MVC) while stabilized at the hips and shoulders, with the back support tensioned to three dierent tightness levels (44. 5, 66. 7 and 89. 0 N) {{as well as a}} no-back support condition. Results. Statistical analysis failed to find a significant eect (P 6 0 : 05) of lumbar back support tension on the average normalized EMG across the 10 trunk muscles sampled. Conclusions. For static experimental tasks, as long as electrodes are protected from direct contact with the back support, studies assessing the eect of lumbar back supports on the trunk muscles via EMG during static tasks are not subject to confounding due to dierences in tensions across subjects. Relevance The {{results of this study suggest}} that variable tensions from previous studies for static exertions with lumbar back supports do not significantly alter the pick-up volume of protected electrodes.

40|$|Muscle fatigue {{affects the}} {{underlying}} EMG-force relationship on which EMG-assisted biomechanical models rely. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the impact of short duration muscle fatigue on the muscle gain value. Participants performed controlled, isometric <b>trunk</b> <b>extension</b> exertions at 10, 20, and 30 degrees of trunk flexion and controlled isokinetic <b>trunk</b> <b>extension</b> exertions at 5 and 15 °/sec on five separate days. Fatigue of the lumbar extensors was generated by moderate-intensity, <b>trunk</b> <b>extension</b> exertions. Participants performed controlled test contractions at defined intervals throughout the fatiguing bout and the EMG activities of trunk muscles were collected. These EMG data were employed in a standard EMG-assisted model and fatigue-dependent trends in the gain factor were evaluated. The results of this study show a significant effect of fatigue on the gain factor. Further analysis revealed that by reducing the magnitude of the gain factor in proportion to the drop in median frequency of the EMG signal of the fatigued muscle, a more accurate estimate of muscle force can be calculated. Mean normalized error between predicted internal moments and the measured external moments improved from 17. 5 to 9. 6 % error via the implementation of this modified gain factor. Relevance to industry Biomechanical models are used to quantify low back stress during occupational lifting tasks. Understanding how these models need to be modified under conditions of muscular fatigue will provide more accurate estimates of stress and can help reduce the incidence of low back injury...|$|R
40|$|Lumbosacral {{orthosis}} (LSO) {{is a type}} of spinal orthosis {{that has}} been recommended for abdominal support, pain management, and motion or positional control. By implemented radiographic technique, objectives {{of this study was to}} evaluate the changes of lumbar lordosis in flexion and <b>extension</b> of <b>trunk</b> movements with and without wearing the LSO measured by Cobb, Centroid, and Posterior Tangent techniques and to correlate the value of lordotic angles in particular posture. Ten healthy male subjects without any history of low back pain participated and a semi-rigid LSO was utilized. Antero-posterior and lateral radiographs of spine images during neutral, flexion, and extension postures, with and without LSO, were captured. Lateral radiographic images were observed by five observers to determine the lumbar lordosis angles by implementation of Cobb, Centroid, and Posterior Tangent methods. Hand drawn line technique was applied on each image using a ruler while lordotic angles were measured using a protractor. Statistical analysis was completed using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences). Lumbar lordoses ranged from 6. 16 ° to 14. 88 ° without orthosis and 15. 24 ° to 17. 92 ° with orthosis for trunk flexion and as for <b>trunk</b> <b>extension</b> with and without orthosis, lumbar lordoses ranged from 39. 92 ° to 57. 96 ° and 36. 24 ° to 56. 88 °, respectively. Correlation between the methods was significant. In addition, there was a significant difference between lumbar lordosis of trunk flexion measured by Cobb and Centroid techniques. However, there were only small changes in <b>trunk</b> <b>extension</b> with and without orthosis measured by Cobb, Centroid, and Posterior Tangent methods. Reliability among observers was also high. Present results indicate that the lumbar lordo is increased when the lumbosacral orthosis was used in both flexion and extension postures...|$|R
