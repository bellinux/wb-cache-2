50|$|Jack Black and Kyle Gass {{initially}} met in Los Angeles in 1985, both {{members of}} the theatre troupe, The Actors' Gang.

This all changed in 1989 in Edinburgh, Scotland, during the Edinburgh Fringe of 1989. They were performing Tim Robbins' and Adam Simon's play Carnage. After arriving home from the trip, the two became very close friends and Black would regularly visit Gass's Cochran Avenue studio apartment in the deal that Gass would teach Black guitar in return for food from fast food <b>chain</b> <b>Jack</b> in the Box.

5000|$|In 1967 Hydranautics, now Bardex Corporation, designed, patented, {{manufactured}} {{and delivered}} the first shiplift using chain instead of wire rope. These Shiplifts differ distinctly {{in the use}} of hydraulic <b>Chain</b> <b>Jacks</b> and Stud Link Anchor Chain to lift commercial ships, naval vessels and submarines. [...] The five distinct advantages to the Bardex <b>Chain</b> <b>Jack</b> Shiplift are: 1) Chain is inherently less susceptible to corrosion and bending fatigue as any chain corrosion is visible on the outside surfaces as opposed to wire rope. For this reason, Lloyd’s shipping register requires 20% of wire ropes to be removed and destructively tested each year with all wire ropes to be replaced every 5-10 years. Lloyd’s does not stipulate any specific duty life limitations for chains which have been known to last for over 20 years in operation.2) Traditional wire rope shiplift systems rely on synchronous motors powering the winches. These motors cause a large power demand on the system when started. Hydraulic systems start at no load so there is no excessive inrush current demand.3) The use of dual chains for redundancy in lieu of a single wire rope at each hoist provides extra safety and reliability.4) Use of chain allows incremental mechanical synchronization of the entire lift operation. The chain links are made to very tight fabrication tolerances so that after each jacking stroke, the platform is set down on the next set of chain links and the level has been “reset”. Wire rope hoist by comparison can become cumulatively unsynchronized over the duration of a lift requiring the operation to stop and be adjusted.4) At all times the shiplift and the vessel are mechanically held by chain resting on support pins not relying on a braking system. 5) Holding the rigid shiplift platform at the correct elevation for Transfer Operations is a locked mechanical function as the chain is pinned in position without the deflection inherent in wire rope systems. A Bardex Shiplift has never dropped a vessel.|$|R
5000|$|In early 2005, A&P placed Farmer Jack for sale, {{seeking an}} {{estimated}} $250M for 71 core stores; the remaining locations were offered individually. [...] Later that year, workers approved wage cuts conditional on a sale to Spartan Stores—which {{was led by}} several former Farmer Jack executives, including its CEO Dennis Edison who led Farmer Jack until his dismissal in 2002, but the deal fell through. Workers then approved a similar package of cuts in exchange for A&P guaranteeing to keep the stores open through May 2007. A&P, which {{was unable to find}} a buyer for Farmer <b>Jack,</b> said the <b>chain</b> would break even for the year and therefore A&P—which had just received a cash injection from the sale of its Canadian division—was in no hurry to sell it. A&P also admitted that because it had anticipated a quick sale, Farmer Jack had been poorly managed for over a year; therefore, the company was returning to loyalty cards and [...] "It's Savings Time" [...] marketing.|$|R
