5|$|Insects {{are also}} used in medicine, for example fly larvae (maggots) were {{formerly}} used to treat wounds to prevent or stop gangrene, as they would only consume dead flesh. This treatment <b>is</b> <b>finding</b> modern usage in some hospitals. Recently insects have also gained attention as potential sources of drugs and other medicinal substances. Adult insects, such as crickets and insect larvae of various kinds, are also commonly used as fishing bait.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the season, Underwood is trying to erase all links to Russo's death. Thus, he kills Barnes by shoving her in front of an oncoming Washington Metro train, and frames her colleague and lover Lucas Goodwin (Sebastian Arcelus) for cyberterrorism. Another early task for newly promoted Underwood <b>is</b> <b>finding</b> his own replacement as House Majority Whip. He supports Jacqueline Sharp (Molly Parker), a military veteran and third-term Representative from California, although he refrains from offering public backing.|$|E

5|$|Setting {{up her own}} {{publishing}} house Marsden House, Karen is relying on useless Ramona as personal assistant. Adam is determined to take things one step further with Tina so they can move in with one another, though she doesn't want to rush things and especially not with David now living with Adam and Matthew following his divorce from Robyn. Pete has landed on his feet as a chauffeur, and Jenny <b>is</b> <b>finding</b> herself seeing a lot less of her husband. Matthew's relationship with Olivia is taken to the next level, to the shock of Karen and Adam.|$|E
5|$|On Halloween, Billie {{tells the}} Halliwells {{her older sister}} Christy Jenkins (Marnette Patterson) was kidnapped by a demon 15 years prior. Billie's {{memories}} are rekindled when she <b>is</b> <b>finding</b> {{the location of a}} demon named Dogan (Eric Steinberg) and recognizes similarities between him and Christy's kidnapper. After this revelation, Billie's storylines focus on her search for her sister; the Halliwells worry about Billie becoming obsessed with finding Christy as she takes more risks to get information, such as interrogating and torturing demons. Billie accuses her parents of choosing to forget Christy rather than trying to locate her. Billie's mother Helen (Barbara Niven) gives her Christy's diary, in which Billie finds a pentagram on the last page. The pentagram is a symbol for the demonic council known as Triad (Steven J. Oliver, Seren Oliver, and Leland Crooke). She eventually gains enough control over her powers to travel to the past, speak to Christy, and find her location.|$|E
25|$|Thirdly, the Court of Appeal {{cautioned that}} in {{applying}} the real risk test, the court must avoid either extreme {{on the legal}} spectrum. One extreme <b>is</b> <b>finding</b> contempt where {{there is only a}} remote or fanciful possibility that public confidence in the administration of justice is undermined, while the other <b>is</b> <b>finding</b> contempt only in the most serious situations.|$|E

25|$|A common problem, {{called the}} {{subgraph}} isomorphism problem, <b>is</b> <b>finding</b> a fixed graph as a subgraph {{in a given}} graph. One reason {{to be interested in}} such a question is that many graph properties are hereditary for subgraphs, which means that a graph has the property if and only if all subgraphs have it too.|$|E

Many bottlers of spring water use UV disinfection equipment to sterilize their water. Solar water disinfection has been researched for cheaply treating contaminated water using natural sunlight. The UV-A irradiation and increased water temperature kill organisms in the water.|$|E
25|$|Two {{important}} and related problems in algebra are the factorization of polynomials, that is, expressing a given polynomial {{as a product}} of other polynomials that can not be factored any further, and the computation of polynomial greatest common divisors. The example polynomial above can be factored as (x − 1)(x + 3). A related class of problems <b>is</b> <b>finding</b> algebraic expressions for the roots of a polynomial in a single variable.|$|E
25|$|Usually, {{the most}} {{difficult}} part of debugging <b>is</b> <b>finding</b> the bug. Once it is found, correcting it is usually relatively easy. Programs known as debuggers help programmers locate bugs by executing code line by line, watching variable values, and other features to observe program behavior. Without a debugger, code may be added so that messages or values may be written to a console or to a window or log file to trace program execution or show values.|$|E

25|$|Applying poisons or {{fires at}} night is an {{effective}} way of exterminating a colony. The most difficult part about this tactic <b>is</b> <b>finding</b> the subterranean nests. The most common method of discovering nests is giving a piece of frog or fish meat attached to a cotton ball to a wasp and following it back to its nest. With V. mandarinia, this is particularly difficult considering its common home flight radius of 1–2km. V. mandarinia travels up to 8km away from the nest.|$|E
25|$|Turkey, meanwhile, <b>is</b> <b>finding</b> the Cham dispute {{a useful}} tool with which to draw {{international}} attention to {{the situation of the}} muslim minority in western Thrace. Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has accused Greece for genocide onto Muslim Albanians. Turkey asked Greece to acknowledge the Albanian nationality of Albanian-speaking Orthodox Christians in the same area, to compensate the displaced Chams for the property they have lost, to provide an Albanian Orthodox Church for Albanian Christians, to repatriate the Cham minority and to provide them with Greek citizenship.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{problem with the}} quality of American medicine is that we’ve failed to view delivery of health care as a science. The tasks of medical science fall into three buckets. One is understanding disease biology. One <b>is</b> <b>finding</b> effective therapies. And one is ensuring those therapies are delivered effectively. That third bucket has been almost totally ignored by research funders, government, and academia. It’s viewed as the art of medicine. That’s a mistake, a huge mistake. And from a taxpayer’s perspective it’s outrageous.|$|E

25|$|Another {{application}} of perfect elimination orderings <b>is</b> <b>finding</b> a maximum clique of a chordal graph in polynomial-time, while {{the same problem}} for general graphs is NP-complete. More generally, a chordal graph can have only linearly many maximal cliques, while non-chordal graphs may have exponentially many. To list all maximal cliques of a chordal graph, simply find a perfect elimination ordering, form a clique for each vertex v together with the neighbors of v that are later than v in the perfect elimination ordering, and test whether each of the resulting cliques is maximal.|$|E
25|$|One {{example of}} an {{optimization}} problem is: Find the shortest curve between two points on a surface, assuming that the curve must also lie on the surface. If the surface is a plane, then the shortest curve is a line. But if the surface is, for example, egg-shaped, then the shortest path is not immediately clear. These paths are called geodesics, {{and one of the}} simplest problems in the calculus of variations <b>is</b> <b>finding</b> geodesics. Another example is: Find the smallest area surface filling in a closed curve in space. This surface is called a minimal surface and it, too, can be found using the calculus of variations.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{interests}} of collectors and EJO Society members <b>is</b> <b>finding</b> and visiting the original sites used by Oxenham in her books. As well as the Buckinghamshire/Oxfordshire area which is the background for Girls of the Hamlet Club and the village of Washford, Somerset where Cleeve Abbey is situated, Oxenham used parts of Sussex, Wales, Lancashire, the English Lake District and Scotland for the settings of several books. The UK Society holds a biennial meeting at Halsway Manor in the summer, which includes folk-dancing and tours of nearby Cleeve Abbey {{as if it were the}} fictional one. These places are not always depicted in the books exactly as the real sites; Oxenham was writing fiction, and given that she could move an abbey several hundred miles for her purposes, changing a few names and telescoping or stretching distances was also well within her remit.|$|E
