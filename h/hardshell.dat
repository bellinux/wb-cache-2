He offers Grimlock freedom in {{exchange}} for his fealty, but Grimlock escapes by grabbing and throwing Starscream into the restraint controls, killing him. He reunites with his teammates Swoop, Slug, and Snarl; then proceeds to kill the defending Insecticons and the swarm leaders named <b>Hardshell,</b> Kickback and Sharpshot. Grimlock learns from Shockwave that their processors were tampered with, leaving Grimlock with a speech impairment. By way of his Space Bridge, Shockwave also found a new planet inhabited by large creatures; these were used to inspire all of their new alternate forms. Grimlock was further modified, and now cannot transform on command, but must be in a state of rage to do so. He recalls a name that Sharpshot gave them, the Dinobots, and claims it as their new team name. Then he notices another Space Bridge tower that Shockwave has constructed nearby. Grimlock fights his way to Shockwave, biting his left arm off and rigging the tower to explode. The crumbling tower falls, killing Grimlock and Shockwave in the process and the portal in Cybertron's orbit begins to decay as the remaining three Dinobots watch in horror.|$|E

40|$|SEAFDEC Contribution No. 182. Prawn {{culture is}} {{becoming}} more widespread in the Philippines. In recent years, prawn production in brackishwater ponds has been adversely affected by a chronic soft-shell syndrome. A field survey of prawn ponds in the island of Panay showed that occurrence of soft-shelled prawns could be predicted with 98 % accuracy under poor soil and water conditions in the ponds. Some management practices were also highly correlated with the soft-shell syndrome. Soft- and hard-shelled prawns collected during the survey were analyzed for calcium and phosphorus levels. In soft-shelled prawns, calcium and phosphorus levels were significantly higher in the hepatopancreas, and phosphorus was significantly lower in the exoskeleton than in <b>hardshelled</b> prawns. Chitinoclastic bacteria, Vibrio and Aeromonas, were isolated from soft-shelled prawns but experimental infection with these species to induce soft-shelling gave largely negative results. Laboratory experiments using an organostannous pesticide revealed that a 96 -h exposure to at least 0. 0154 ppm of the pesticide could result in soft-shelling of 47 - 60 % of the prawns. Soft-shelled prawns were fed various quantities of frozen mussel meat for 4 weeks {{to find out if}} soft-shelling could be reversed by dietary manipulation.

40|$|Wave {{action is}} known to {{influence}} the abundance and distribution of intertidal organisms. Wave action will also determine the duration and suitability of various foraging windows (high-tide and low-tide, day and night) for predation and can also affect predator behaviour, both directly by impeding prey handling and indirectly by influencing prey abundance. It remains uncertain whether semiterrestrial mobile predators such as crabs which can access intertidal prey during emersion when the effects of wave action are minimal, are influenced by exposure. Here, we assessed the effect of wave action on the abundance and population structure (size and gender) of the semi-terrestrial intertidal crab Pachygrapsus marmoratus on rocky shores in Portugal. The activity of P. marmoratus with the tidal cycle on sheltered and exposed shores was established using baited pots at high-tide to examine whether there was activity during intertidal immersion and by low-tide searches. Because prey abundance varies along a wave exposure gradient on most Portuguese shores and because morphology of crab chelipeds {{are known to be}} related to diet composition, we further tested the hypothesis that predator stomach contents reflected differences in prey abundance along the horizontal gradient in wave exposure and that this would be correlated with the crab cheliped morphology. Thus, we examined phenotypic variation in P. marmoratus chelipeds across shores of differing exposure to wave action. P. marmoratus was only active during lowtide. Patterns of abundance and population structure of crabs did not vary with exposure to wave action. Stomach contents, however, varied significantly between shores of differing exposure with a higher consumption of <b>hardshelled</b> prey (mussels) on exposed locations, where this type of prey is more abundant, and a higher consumption of barnacles on sheltered shores. Multivariate geometric analysis of crab claws showed that claws were signifocantly larger on exposed shores. There was a significant correlation between animals with larger claws and the abundance of mussels in their stomach. Variation in cheliped size may have resulted from differing food availability on sheltered and exposed shores...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2009 There is little, if any, direct fossil {{evidence}} of the cardiovascular, respiratory, reproductive or digestive biology of dinosaurs. However, a variety of data {{can be used to}} draw reasonable inferences about the physiology of the carnivorous theropod dinosaurs (Archosauria: Theropoda). Extant archosaurs, birds and crocodilians, possess regionally differentiated, vascularized and avascular lungs, although the crocodilian lung is less specialized than the avian lung air-sac system. Essential components of avian lungs include the voluminous, thin-walled abdominal air-sacs which are ventilated by an expansive sternum and specialized ribs. Inhalatory, paradoxical collapse of these air-sacs in birds is prevented by the synsacrum, pubes and femoral-thigh complex. The present work examines the theropod abdomen and reveals that it lacked sufficient space to have housed similarly enlarged abdominal air-sacs as well as the skeleto-muscular modifications requisite to have ventilated them. There is little evidence to indicate that theropod dinosaurs possessed a specialized bird-like, air-sac lung and, by extension, that theropod cardiovascular function was any more sophisticated than that of crocodilians. Conventional wisdom holds that theropod visceral anatomy was similar to that in birds. However, exceptional soft tissue preservation in Scipionyx samnitcus (Theropoda) offers rare {{evidence of}} in situ theropod visceral anatomy. Using computed tomography, close comparison of Scipionyx with gastrointestinal morphology in crocodilians, birds and lizards indicates that theropod visceral structure and “geography” was strikingly similar only to that in Alligator. In modern birds, there exists a unique osseous tissue, medullary bone, which forms only in adult females as a source of calcium for developing <b>hardshelled,</b> calcified eggs. Although crocodilians also produce calcified eggshells, no medullary bone is formed. Recent supposed identification of medullary bone in Tyrannosaurus rex (Theropoda) suggests an avian style of reproduction was present in dinosaurs and, if correct, would seem to support a close relationship between dinosaurs and birds. However, scanning electron microscopy demonstrates that claims of medullary bone in theropod dinosaurs should be regarded with skepticism as the tissues recovered are not unique from those recovered in growing Alligator. These data provide evidence of significant but heretofore unrecognized differences between avian and theropodan dinosaur internal structure and function...|$|R
40|$|Foi realizado experimento em laboratÃrio para observar a predaÃÃo do caranguejo mÃo-grossa Menippe nodifrons sobre trÃs espÃcies de moluscos gastrÃpodes: Stramonita haemastoma, Tegula viridula e Neritina virginea. Os aspectos observados foram de preferÃncia alimentar do caranguejo, tempo de manipulaÃÃo e manipulaÃÃo das presas, tamanho crÃtico da presa, e ainda, a anÃlise biomecÃnica das quelas dos caranguejos. Os caranguejos e os moluscos foram coletados na praia do Pacheco, localizada no municÃpio de Caucaia-Ce. Menippe nodifrons alimentou-se das trÃs espÃcies de gastrÃpodes, com uma maior preferÃncia alimentar por N. virginea (n = 62) em relaÃÃo aos outros moluscos oferecidos S. haemastoma (n = 41) e T. viridula (n = 35). A predaÃÃo pelos caranguejos foi maior sobre S. haemastoma, do que em T. viridula. Os machos predaram mais ativamente Neritina virginea, enquanto as fÃmeas nÃo tiveram preferÃncia por nenhuma das presas oferecidas, predando-as indistintamente. O tempo de manipulaÃÃo foi menor para N. virginea (44, 2 min.) do que para S. haemastoma (106, 1 min.) e T. viridula (120, 7 min.). Os moluscos foram manipulados atravÃs de duas tÃcnicas: esmagamento e descascamento. O esmagamento foi predominante em Neritina virginea, enquanto que o descascamento foi usualmente maior em Tegula viridula e Stramonita haemastoma. O tamanho crÃtico da presa foi menor para N. virginea (0, 34), seguida por S. haemastoma (0, 38) e T. viridula (0, 50) respectivamente. O caranguejo Menippe nodifrons apresentou vantagem mecÃnica para as duas quelas (Quela Maior = 0, 38) e (Quela menor = 0, 32), que os classificam como especialistas em quebrar conchas mais resistentes e duras. As quelas sÃo dimÃrficas e possuem dentiÃÃes diferentes, com atividades funcionais distintas para quebrar as conchas dos moluscos. O comportamento predatÃrio do caranguejo Menippe nodifrons estÃ diretamente relacionado ao nÃvel de especializaÃÃo de suas quelas, das caracterÃsticas morfolÃgicas e vulnerabilidade de suas presas. {{experiments}} {{were used to}} study {{the effect of the}} predation of the crab Menippe nodifrons on the gastropods Stramonita haemastoma, Tegula viridula and Neritina virginea. Aspects studied were prey preference, handling time, predation techniques, prey critical size and chelal biomechanic analysis of the crabs. The crabs and the clams were collected in Pacheco beach, located in the city of Caucaia-Ce. Menippe nodifrons preferred Neritina virginea over both Stramonita haemastoma and Tegula viridula, and Stramonita haemastoma was strongly preferred over Tegula viridula, possibly because of differences in shell characteristics among the three species. The male crabs preyed more heavily upon Neritina virginea than on both gastropods Stramonita haemastoma and Tegula viridula, while the females had eaten indistinctly the three clams. There were differences in hadling times between Neritina virginea, Stramonita haemastoma and Tegula viridula (handling times: N. virginea < S. haemastoma < T. viridula). Crabs attacked snails using crushing and peeling techniques, the last was used only upon S. haemastoma and T. viridula. The mean critical size for Neritina virginea was significantly smaller than that for Stramonita haemastoma, which in turn was smaller than that for Tegula viridula. The claws of the crab Menippe nodifrons are well designed for breaking shells. Menipppe nodifrons is heterochelous, having one larger crusher claw and one smaller less robust cutter claw. Due to their greater mechanical advantage, crusher claws are able to generate considerably greater forces than cutters. Differences in the morphological and mechanical features of crab claws reflect their function and account for many of the observed differences in prey handling techniques and foraging behavior. Menippe nodifrons seems to be pecialised for attacking <b>hardshelled</b> molluscan prey. The predatory behavior of the crab Menippe nodifrons {{is directly related to the}} level of specialization of its claws, of the morphological characteristics and vulnerability of its prey items...|$|R
