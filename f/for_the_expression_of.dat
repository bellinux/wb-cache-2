5|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> mood, English uses {{a number}} of modal auxiliaries, such as can, may, will, shall and the past tense forms could, might, would, should. There is also a subjunctive and an {{imperative}} mood, both based on the plain form of the verb (i.e. without the third person singular -s), and which is used in subordinate clauses (e.g. subjunctive: It is important that he run every day; imperative Run!).|$|E
5|$|Modern English grammar is {{the result}} of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European {{dependent}} marking pattern with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order, to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection, a fairly fixed SVO word order and a complex syntax. Modern English relies more on auxiliary verbs and word order <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> complex tenses, aspect and mood, as well as passive constructions, interrogatives and some negation. Despite noticeable variation among the accents and dialects of English used in different countries and regions – in terms of phonetics and phonology, and sometimes also vocabulary, grammar and spelling – English-speakers from around the world are able to communicate with one another with relative ease.|$|E

40|$|Introduction The {{structural}} changes underlying permanent noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) include {{loss of the}} sensory hair cells, damage to their stereocilia, and supporting tissues within the cochlear lateral wall. Objective The objective {{of this study is}} to demonstrate curcumin as a safe and effective therapeutic agent in the prevention and treatment for fibroblasts damage within the cochlear supporting tissues and lateral wall through cell death pathway. Methods We divided 24 Rattus norvegicus into 4 groups, Group 1 : control; Group 2 : noise (+); Group 3 : noise (+), 50 mg/day curcumin (+); Group 4 : noise (+), 100 mg/day curcumin (+). We provided the noise exposure dose at 100 [*]dB SPL for two hours over two weeks and administered the curcumin orally over two weeks. We examined all samples <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> calcineurin, nuclear factor of activated T-cells cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc 1), and apoptotic index of cochlear fibroblasts. Results We found significant differences <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> calcineurin (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) in all groups, significant differences <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>expressions</b> <b>of</b> NFATc 1 (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) in all groups, except in Groups 1 and 4, and significant differences <b>for</b> <b>the</b> apoptotic index (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) in all groups. Conclusion Curcumin proved to be potentially effective in the prevention and treatment for fibroblasts damage within the cochlear supporting tissues and lateral wall regarding <b>the</b> decreased <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> calcineurin, NFATc 1, and apoptotic index of cochlear fibroblasts...|$|R

25|$|Within the Pagan movement, {{there can}} be found many deities, both male and female, who have various {{associations}} and embody forces of nature, aspects of culture, and facets of human psychology.

25|$|Art {{therapy and}} other creative, {{humanistic}} intervention strategies are becoming popular methods {{for working with}} life-threatened patient and for working with the family members of patients who die—particularly bereaved children.

25|$|The Nutcracker, on {{the other}} hand, is one of Tchaikovsky's best known works.

This scenario provided no opportunity <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> human feelings beyond the most trivial and confined Tchaikovsky mostly within a world of tinsel, sweets and fantasy. Yet, at its best, the melodies are charming and pretty, and by this time Tchaikovsky's virtuosity at orchestration and counterpoint ensured an endless fascination in the surface attractiveness of the score.|$|E

25|$|Misotheistic and/or dystheistic {{expression}} has a {{long history}} in the arts and in literature. Bernard Schweizer’s book Hating God: The Untold Story of Misotheism is devoted to this topic. He traces the history of ideas behind misotheism from the Book of Job, via Epicureanism and the twilight of Roman paganism, to deism, anarchism, Nietzschean philosophy, feminism, and radical humanism. The main literary figures in his study are Percy Bysshe Shelley, Algernon Swinburne, Zora Neale Hurston, Rebecca West, Elie Wiesel, Peter Shaffer, and Philip Pullman. Schweizer argues that literature is the preferred medium <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> God-hatred because the creative possibilities of literature allow writers to simultaneously unburden themselves of their misotheism, while ingeneously veiling their blasphemy.|$|E
25|$|Although SDN is much {{related to}} sexual partner {{preferences}} in males, {{it does not}} show the same relationship to partner preferences in females. Evidence shows that SDN in medial preoptic area is not the prerequisite <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> male-typical sexual behaviour and sexual partner preferences in females. One piece of evidence comes from the study on female Japanese macaque, which routinely court, mount (with pelvic thrust), compete for, and even prefer certain female sexual partners over certain males. The {{part of the brain}} examined is the anterior hypothalamic nucleus (AHdc), a homologue of SDN-POA. Comparison of the AHdc nucleus volumes between Japanese macaque and rhesus macaque (a closely related sister species of Japanese macaque) shows that there is {{no significant difference between the}} volume of AHdc in more male-typical macaques and that in female-typical macaques.|$|E
25|$|Ciliary {{neurotrophic}} factor (CNTF) is a cytosolic protein {{that is not}} secreted. CNTF {{has been shown to}} promote the survival of neuronal cultures in vitro, and it can also act as a differentiator and trophic factor on glial cells. Further, CNTF has been previously shown to affect the differentiation of glial precursor cells in vitro; however, the influence of CNTF in the in vivo setting has only recently been determined. Winter et al. used CNTF over-expressing transgenic mice as well as wildtype controls that had CNTF levels artificially elevated via injection, were subjected to neuronal damage using ZnSO4 (a known neuronal degenerative factor), which was injected intranasally in the olfactory epithelium. The olfactory bulb was then assessed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>expression</b> <b>of</b> GFAP mRNA- a common marker for the glial scar. It was determined that mice with elevated levels of CNTF increased their GFAP mRNA expression two-fold. This data suggests that CNTF may mediate glial scar formation following CNS damage.|$|E
