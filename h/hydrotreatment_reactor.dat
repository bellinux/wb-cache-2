40|$|Deactivation of a 0. 53 wt% Pt/γ-Al 2 ­ O 3 {{catalyst}} due {{to strongly}} adsorbed carbonaceous residue was investigated.   The {{role of the}} carbonaceous residue formed during hydrocarbon conversion reactions of 1 -octene, toluene and 1 : 1 volume mixture of 1 -octene/toluene at 300, 400 and 450 °C was established and a model developed {{to account for the}} activity and selectivity changes at the very start of the reaction, just as the hydrocarbon residue begins to form {{on the surface of the}} catalyst.   CO pulse chemisorption was used to determine the extent of Pt surface blocked by the hydrocarbon residue by titrating the Pt sites that remained exposed.   The efficiency of catalyst regeneration with H 2 at 400 °C was investigated and hydrocarbon reactions were performed on the regenerated catalyst to assess the catalytic activity and selectivity on a Pt surface covered with carbonaceous residue.   Characterisation of the carbonaceous residue deposited on the catalyst during hydrocarbon conversion reactions was carried out using TPO, TGA-MS and Raman microspectroscopy.   The amount, composition, reactivity and chemical structure of the carbonaceous residue in relation to reaction time and temperature was investigated. Increasing the reaction temperature accelerated the formation of coke.   The H:C ratio of the carbonaceous residue played an important role in the selectivity of the hydrocarbon reaction.   In addition, two batches of the 0. 53 wt% Pt/γ-Al 2 O 3 catalyst spent six months in an industrial Pyrolysis gasoline (Pygas) <b>Hydrotreatment</b> <b>reactor.</b>   The catalyst batches were strategically placed at the inlet and outlet of the reactor.   Raman microspectroscopy revealed that the coke accumulated on the individually coked samples consisted of a mixture of disordered and ordered pre-graphitic polycrystalline coke.   The reactivity and type of the coke varied between the samples placed near the inlet or the outlet of the industrial reactor.

40|$|Pilot-scale <b>hydrotreatment</b> <b>reactors</b> often {{operate with}} gas-liquid upflow. For {{this type of}} {{operation}} {{there is a lack}} of information concerning the nonideal characteristics of the liquid flow, especially at elevated pressures. In this study, the Peclet number and liquid holdup of a pilot- scale upflow reactor were derived by residence time distribution experiments. The experiments were carried out at various operating pressures with different feed gases. The liquid-phase mixing was found to be identical for constant feed volumetric superficial velocities calculated at the system pressure. The liquid holdup diminished when elevated pressures were used. The use of very high gas flow rates during the shift of the operating pressure can intensify the liquid-phase nonidealities.
