NY31 itself was assigned in the mid-1920s, utilizing all of legislative Route30 (modern NY31, NY429, and NY104) west of Rochester and much of its current alignment from Rochester to Lenox. At Lenox, NY31 turned southeast to follow what is now NY316 and NY46 to NY5 in Oneida. It was realigned by 1929 to continue west to Lewiston on Ridge Road and altered in the 1930 renumbering of state highways <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>to</b> continue east to Utica via Verona.
