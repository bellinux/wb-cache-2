40|$|AbstractThe {{production}} of a notable, safe and highly active pectinase by the local fungal strain Trichoderma viride EF- 8 utilizing the abundant pigmented <b>Egyptian</b> <b>onion</b> (Allium cepa L.) skins (6. 5 %, w/v) was achieved in 4 days submerged fermentation (SMF) cultures, at temperature and pH of 30 °C and 4. 0, respectively. The indigenously produced pectinase was partially purified by 50 % batch ethanol precipitation and its general properties were studied following the standard procedures. The lyophilized enzyme preparation was free of any ochra or aflatoxins. The optimum conditions for the partially purified enzyme form were 2 mg/mL and 1 % (w/v) enzyme protein and substrate (citrus pectin) concentrations, reaction pH and temperature of 7. 0 and 40 °C, respectively. The results presented the low cost onion skins waste as the major substrate for the fungal pectinase production and its subsequent use in perfect fruit (apple, lemon and orange) juices clarification with remarkable stability during and after this process, which certainly enhance fruit juices processing in the tropics...|$|E
40|$|Selenium, vitamin C, pungency, amino acids, {{phenolics}} {{content and}} antioxidant activities of two <b>Egyptian</b> <b>onion</b> varieties, namely white (Giza- 6) and red (Beheri) onions have been studied. Data {{analysis showed that}} the red variety presents higher values for selenium, vitamin C and sulphur-containing amino acids. Concerning pungency, white onion can be classified as intermediate pungency (8. 24 μmol of Pyruvic acid/ 100 g fresh wt.) and red as pungent (11. 37 μmol of pyruvic acid/ 100 g fresh wt.). The phenolic acids, flavonols, anthocyanins and total phenolics content in red variety (81. 59, 70. 38, 7. 56 and 187. 17 mg/ 100 g fresh wt., respectively) were higher than for white variety (72. 47, 32. 49, 4. 90 and 131. 65 mg/ 100 g fresh wt., respectively). Consequently, antioxidant activity was higher for the red variety. Correlation analysis indicates that phenolic compounds beside other factors including Se and sulphur-containing amino acid contents play the {{major role in the}} antioxidant activity of onion bulbs. The antioxidant capacity of freeze dried powder from both onion varieties was also tested in sunflower oil-in-water emulsions and hydroperoxide formation was monitored during storage at 40 °C. In accordance with differences in Se, sulphur-containing amino acid and phenolics content, Egyptian red onions had better antioxidant activity, while white onions was only effective {{in the early stages of}} the oxidation process. These data indicates that red variety has higher potential health benefits related to the presence of antioxidant compounds...|$|E
40|$|Top, tree or <b>Egyptian</b> <b>onion,</b> Allium x proliferum (Moench) Schrader, 2 n= 2 x= 16, is a minor, vegetatively {{propagated}} garden crop in Europe, North America and North East Asia. Several clones {{of the top}} onion {{were found}} to be locally cultivated in the region of South Croatia under the name “Ljutika-talijanka”. One of these, clone Biorina, was studied by means of both classical cytogenetic techniques (karyotyping and meiosis) as well as molecular techniques (genomic in situ hybridization, GISH and flow cytometry). Analysis of a Feulgen stained karyotype revealed its pseudodiploid structure, since among 16 chromosomes no homologous pairs could be detected. A high frequency of heteromorphic bivalents, followed by univalents and a rare occurrence of multivalents, was recorded in meiosis in the pollen mother cells. Although bivalents with random chiasmata prevailed, we observed occasional occurrence of the bivalents with localized chiasmata. All pollen degenerates at the one-nucleate stage, resulting in complete pollen sterility. Using GISH, we identified the parental origin of all 16 chromosomes and confirmed the hybrid status of the analyzed clone: 8 longer chromosomes originated from the Allium cepa L. parent, whereas 8 shorter chromosomes originated from the Allium fis- tulosum L. parent. The investigated clone had an intermediate amount of DNA (26. 98 pg DNA/ 2 C) as compared to its parent species, A. cepa (31. 95 pg DNA/ 2 C) and A. fistulosum (21. 62 pg DNA/ 2 C) ...|$|E
40|$|Viviparous {{onions are}} {{cultivated}} mainly by home gardeners {{in the northern}} parts of Japan, China, the United States, and Europe. In spite of an abundance of common names applied to those viviparous onions, there is not any one cultivar name attached to them, and there also prevails a no less confusion in the systematic knowledge of those forms. Cytogenetic studies {{have been carried out}} with 12 strains of viviparous onions cultivated in Japan. From the result obtained, those 12 strains could be classified into 3 different groups as shown in the following: 1. Six (Yagura-negi group) strains showing the same karyotype as that of Allium fistulosum, excepting 2 strains which are heterozygote to a deficient satellite. The following formulae were assigned to these 2 different strains; K(2 n) ＝ 14 V+ 2 J^T and K(2 n) ＝ 14 V+J+J^T. 2. One (bulb-bearing onion group) strain showing the same karyotype as that of Allium cepa. The formula assigned to this strain was K(2 n) ＝ 14 V+ 2 J^t. 3. Five (Catawissa onion group) strains showing clearly the same heterozygous karyotype. The following formula assigned to these strains was K(2 n) ＝ 14 V+J_ 1 +J^T_ 2. All the strains belonging to Catawissa onion group have revealed usually the irregular meiosis in PMCs, while the other ones mentioned above showed, in turn, the normal meiotic processes. At meiotic metaphase-I of their PMCs Catawissa strains showed the configulation, (8 － 3) _II+(0 － 10) _I, the average frequency of pairings being 6. 19 _II+ 3. 18 _I. Thus the later meiotic processes showed certain irregularities, providing several lagging chromosomes and certain chromosome bridges. Abnormal sporad cells, accompanying micronuclei, resulted usually. In consequence, most of young pollen-grains thus raised became to be degenerated soon. The comparative analyses of karyological, ecological and morphological features with the Catawissa onion will be duly taken as a certain hybrid form derived from the crosses between Allium cepa and. A. fistulosum, both of which are provided with genes for the character viviparity. A number of informations obtained from various literatures concerning the origin of Catawissa onion made the hypothesis quite feasible that this onion would have been raised through certain hybridization process, spontaneous or artificial, in some northern region of the United States during the years between 17002 ̆ 7 s and 18002 ̆ 7 s. In consequence, the proposed classification with viviparous onions will be presented as follows: 1. Yagura-negi; Allium fistulosum L. var. viviparum Makino 2. Bulb-bearing onion, <b>Egyptian</b> <b>onion,</b> or tree onion; Allium cepa L. var. bulbellifera Bailey 3. Catawissa onion or top onion; Allium cepa L. var. viviparum (Metzg.) Alef.

(省略) 3. 花粉母細胞減数分裂は,ヤグラネギ,ヤグラタマネギでは何れも殆んど正常であつたが,セイタカヤグラネギでは著しい異常分裂像が観察された. すなわち,第一分裂中期では(8 - 3) _II+(0 - 10) _ 1 の染色体対合の変異が見られ,それらの平均対合像は 6. 19 _II+ 3. 8 _Iであつた. それ以後の分裂期においては,遅滞染色体,染色体橋の出現頻度が高く,その結果著しい不稔を発現した. 4. セイタカヤグラネギは,その異型接合的染色体構成と減数分裂の異常性から,雑種起原植物と推定せられた. さらに核型分析その他の観察結果から,両親植物はネギとタマネギであろうと考えられた. 5. 文献的検討の結果,セイタカヤグラネギは, 1700 年代から 1800 年代にかけて,北米の北部地方で,それぞれやぐら性遺伝子をもつた,タマネギとネギとの間の雑種として成立したものであろうとの推定が導かれた. 6. 以上の諸結果を総合して,ヤグラ性ネギ類は次の如く分類するのが妥当であるとした. ヤグラネギ Allium fistulosum L. var. viviparum Makino ヤグラタマネギ Allium cepa L. var. bulbellifera Bailey セイタカヤグラネギ Allium cepa.
