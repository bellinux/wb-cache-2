40|$|City regions {{have become}} a key {{paradigm}} in current academic debates, and with them the notion of network-based, polycentric spaces. They have moved to the foreground of national (and EU) policies of creating economic 'champions' for successful national economies.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with theories of territorial economic development in the knowledge based economy, and in particular those concerned with understanding the dynamics of innovation as an economic development process. There has recently been a growing disquiet about the various models used to explain these processes, the so-called Territorial Innovation models, focusing on their narrow regional focus, their orientation towards political rather than <b>economic</b> <b>territories,</b> their uncritical adoption to explain many regional situations and their limited empirical testing. Nevertheless, TIMs have retained a salience and acceptance because they do seek to explain and understand a phenomenon of uneven regional territorial development for which explanations arising in other disciplines are fundamentally unsatisfying. Therefore, addressing these critiques is a central challenge for regional studies, to resolve these tensions and produce more conceptually rigorous and empirically underpinned theories of regional economic change. To take a first step on this journey, in this paper, we address ourselves to a singl...|$|R
50|$|The extra-regio {{territory}} {{is made up}} of parts of the <b>economic</b> <b>territory</b> of a country which cannot be assigned to a single region. It consists of the national air-space, territorial waters and the continental shelf lying in international waters over which the country enjoys exclusive rights, territorial exclaves, deposits of oil, natural gas etc. worked by resident units. Until 2011, the gross value added (GVA) produced in the extra-regio was allocated pro-rata to the inhabited regions of the country concerned. The order of magnitude of the extra-regio GVA depends in particular on the resource endowment in terms of natural gas and oil. In 2011, Member States and the European Commission agreed to give countries the possibility to calculate regional GDP also for the extra-regio. The resulting GDP is available only in absolute values, because the extra-regio territory by definition does not have a resident population.|$|E
5000|$|Already in the 1860s {{a railway}} {{committee}} of Trier had promoted a connection from Trier via Hermeskeil and Kusel to Landstuhl. The aim {{was a better}} railway connection between western and southern Germany. These efforts were unsuccessful, as only railway built on this route was the line from Landstuhl to Kusel. Another committee, which {{was established in the}} 1890s for the closing of the gap between Kusel and Türkismühle, also failed. In the subsequent period a committee was established with plans for a railway line from Heimbach via Baumholder to Kusel and this was supported by petitions from several communities such as Kusel and Freisen. In 1910, another committee was founded for a line from Türkismühle to Kusel, which suggested two different routes: one would run from Oberkirchen (now in the municipality of Freisen) to Türkismühle and another from Kusel via Oberkirchen to Sankt Wendel. [...] After Germany’s defeat in the First World War the Saar territory was separated from Germany, the district of Restkreis St. Wendel-Baumholder (the “rest” of the Sankt Wendel district that had not been absorbed into the Allied-controlled Saar), in particular, championed the railway line, as the Saar was no longer part of the German <b>economic</b> <b>territory</b> {{as a result of the}} customs border. In 1927, both public authorities and economic and community organisations were active in the foundation of the Association for the Advancement of the Construction of the Türkismühle-Kusel Railway (Vereinigung zur Förderung des Bahnbaues Türkismühle-Kusel). On 31 March 1931, the project was included in the so-called [...] "frontier program," [...] even though at first it was not clear whether in this context, a railway or a road connection would result. On 7 October of that year, the Ministry of Transport approved a rail link. In addition, the construction would counteract the increasing unemployment. To finance this, the government made a loan to Deutsche Reichsbahn. During the course of the building, Kusel station had to be fundamentally redesigned. In particular, since the line being built continuously lost height from Diedelkopf, it achieved the level of line from Landstuhl only in the eastern part of the station. The section from Kusel to Diedelkopf was completed on 15 May 1936 and the line was opened to traffic along its entire length on 16 November 1936.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{development}} of Europe’s <b>economic</b> <b>territory</b> today can be characterised {{as a process}} of metropolisation of economic development potentials and innovation capacities. “Metropolisation ” is a paraphrase for the selective concentration of research-intensive industries and knowledge-intensive services on metropolitan regions and major urban agglomerations. On this basis the metropolitan regions and urban agglomerations are functioning as the “motors ” of the European economy. In this article the metropolisation of the European <b>economic</b> <b>territory</b> is being analysed with regard to the increasing specialisation of Europe’s major urban regions on knowledge-intensive economic activities. Particular emphasis is being put on the different sectoral profiles and development paths of the European urban agglomerations ’ and metropolitan regions ’ knowledge-intensive economy. The result of this analysis is a differentiated representation of the developmental dynamics in the European Union urban system which allows to overcome simplifying general trend descriptions as for example the structural change of urban regions towards becoming “service centres”...|$|E

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal Geography Compass, [© Blackwell Publishing]. The definitive version is available at www. blackwell-synergy. comA decade ago, regions were the hot topic in political economy. Convinced by accounts of how regions were competitive <b>economic</b> <b>territories</b> per excellence and crucial sites for promoting a plural society, the 'new regionalism' ascended to a position of orthodoxy in political economy. Today, the memory of these halcyon days is but a distant one with the past decade seeing regions be the site for a number of topical debates that appear, at first sight, to challenge the regional concept: the collapse of the new regionalist orthodoxy; the theoretical ascendancy of relational approaches to conceptualising spatiality; and the political ascendancy of the 'city-region' concept. All of which suggests that the regional concept may be under threat in contemporary political economy. But it also prompts the need to confront searching questions as to whether we are in fact witnessing the awakening of a new geography of the region. This article emphasises the latter, arguing that what we are witnessing is {{the emergence of a new}} era of 'relational regionalism' in political econom...|$|R

Being a resident of a country member of {{a currency}} union necessarily implies being a resident of this currency union. The question is asked {{as to whether the}} reverse is true, i. e. does being a resident unit of a currency union imply being a resident unit of at least one member country of the union? In other words, can the existence of a currency union create a residence status additional to the residence status of the component economies of the currency union? 2. In the first place, this paper discusses the issue of the residence status of a currency union central bank (CUCB) in a currency union.

40|$|I. Current {{international}} {{standards for the}} statistical treatment of the issue BPM 5 states that: 63. In most cases, {{it is reasonable to}} assume that an institutional unit has a center of economic interest in a country if the unit has already engaged in economic activities and transactions on a significant scale in the country for one year or more, or if the unit intends to do so. The conduct of economic activities and transactions over a period of one year normally implies a center of interest, but the choice of any specific period of time is somewhat arbitrary. The one-year period is suggested only as a guideline and not as an inflexible rule. 66. A household has a center of economic interest when household members maintain, within the country, a dwelling or succession of dwellings treated and used by members of the household as their principal residence. All individuals who belong to the same household must be residents of the same country. If a member of an existing household ceases to reside in the country where his or her household is resident, the individual ceases to be a member of that household. 67.
