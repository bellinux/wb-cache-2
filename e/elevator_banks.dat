5|$|The Augustus {{opened in}} 2005 with 949 rooms, which were {{designed}} for more upscale luxury and service than {{the other parts of}} the resort. It is accessed through a private small lobby separate from the main Caesars' entrance. The rooms feature 9-foot ceilings with hotel chambers beginning at about , and going up to 2470 square feet for the largest suites. All feature spa tubs and televisions in the bathrooms. One of the highlights of the space is that the rooms view the Garden of the Gods pool area. On {{the second floor of the}} tower is a spa containing Roman baths of hot, cold and lukewarm pools; relaxing chaise longues sculpted of stone, which are underwater in the heated pool; and 51 separate therapy rooms. This tower, along with the Octavius Tower, forms a part of the 'Laurel Collection', Caesars boutique experience on the property. It features private <b>elevator</b> <b>banks</b> and exclusive Laurel Collection key cards.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{entrance}} {{at the head}} of Fort Washington Avenue, where it ends at Margaret Corbin Circle. There is also {{an entrance}} at the west side of Bennett Avenue {{on the bottom of the}} ridge, midblock between Broadway and 192nd Street, consisting of a passageway to the mezzanine and the <b>elevator</b> <b>banks.</b> The building for the entrance on Fort Washington Avenue was originally a plain brick one, but it was later given a stone facade to harmonize it with the entrance to Fort Tryon Park, which lies directly across Margaret Corbin Circle. Fare control is located in one central location on the lower mezzanine level. The elevators are available for use at no charge for pedestrians going between Hudson Heights, on top of the ridge, to the Broadway valley of Washington Heights at the bottom. Because of stairs at the Ft. Washington Avenue entrance, the pedestrian connection is not handicap accessible. There is an accessible pedestrian connection at 184th street using the 181st Station elevator.|$|E
500|$|The lobby has dim {{lighting}} {{that gives}} it a somewhat subdued quality, although the appliques of the lamps are striking and iconic. Both factors create an intimate atmosphere and highlight the place. Vertical bars of fluorescent light are covered with Belgian blue marble and Mexican amber onyx, which extinguishes and diffuses the light with a soft shine that both illuminates and fuses with the red marble walls. [...] The lobby also contains four <b>elevator</b> <b>banks,</b> all with a different design.|$|E

500|$|To {{meet the}} Port Authority's {{requirement}} to build 10million square feet (930,000m²) of office space, the buildings would each {{need to be}} 110 stories tall. A major limiting factor in building heights is elevators; the taller the building, the more elevators are needed to service the building, requiring more space-consuming <b>elevator</b> <b>banks.</b> Yamasaki and the engineers decided to use a new system that included sky lobbies, which are floors where people can switch from a large-capacity express elevator, which goes only to the sky lobbies, to a local elevator that goes to each floor in a section (the local elevators can be stacked within the same elevator shaft). Located on the 44th and 78th floors of each tower, the sky lobbies enabled the elevators to be used efficiently, while also {{increasing the amount of}} usable space on each floor from 62 to 75 percent by reducing the number of required elevator shafts. [...] The World Trade Center towers were the second supertall buildings to use sky lobbies, after the John Hancock Center in Chicago. [...] This system was inspired by the New York City Subway system, whose lines include local stations where local trains stop and express stations where all trains stop.|$|E
500|$|One Meridian Plaza was a 38-story {{high-rise}} {{office building}} designed by Vincent Kling & Associates. Construction on the [...] tower began in 1968, {{was completed in}} 1972 and approved for occupancy in 1973. Built {{at the corner of}} 15th Street and South Penn Square in Center City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the $40 million high-rise was built adjacent to the Girard Trust Building, now the Ritz-Carlton Philadelphia, and the front faced Philadelphia City Hall across the street. The rectangular One Meridian Plaza was [...] long and [...] wide and contained [...] Of the 38 floors, 36 were occupiable and 2 were mechanical floors. The structure also had 3 underground levels. The building's structure was composed of steel and concrete and the facade was a granite curtain wall. There were two helipads on the roof. One Meridian Plaza's eastern stairwell connected the building to the adjacent Girard Trust Building. At one point there were plans to build a structure {{on the south side of}} One Meridian Plaza that would share one of the <b>elevator</b> <b>banks</b> in the high-rise, but nothing came of the plans mainly due to neither site having the same owner. On the northwest corner of the property is a bronze sculpture called [...] "Triune." [...] Designed by Robert Engman the abstract sculpture was not damaged in the 1991 fire and was still there in 1999. The following year the builders of The Residences at The Ritz-Carlton announced that they were considering demolishing the sculpture. In the end the statue was retained and still stands at the location it was originally installed at as of 2014.|$|E
2500|$|The front {{entrance}} to the capitol opens directly into the four-story, rectangular Memorial Hall. The Hall is [...] long and [...] wide; it {{is often referred to}} as a [...] "rotunda" [...] despite not being round as it takes the place of one in a traditional domed capitol. Embedded in the floor, in the center of Memorial Hall, is a bronze plaque [...] in diameter and weighing [...] The plaque depicts a relief map of Louisiana showing parish boundaries and seats, industries and exports, and the flora and fauna of Louisiana. Mounted on the balcony over the <b>elevator</b> <b>banks</b> are the flags of the entities that have held dominion over Louisiana.|$|E

2500|$|John F. Kennedy Campus {{is located}} along the north-south {{border of the}} Bronx and Manhattan, {{the eastern half of}} the campus within Marble Hill, and the western half in Spuyten Duyvil, with the Hudson Line of the Metro-North Railroad and Spuyten Duyvil Creek to the south. Marble Hill is {{politically}} part of Manhattan, but geographically within the Bronx. The school was built as part of an [...] "educational park" [...] along with PS/MS 37 and In-Tech Academy (MS/HS 38) to the north. The high school building was built to serve 4,000 students and is eight-stories high, but is depressed from the surrounding neighborhoods in the former creek riverbed. Entrance to the building is via a pedestrian bridge at the fourth floor, leading east to Terrace View Avenue in Marble Hill. A second bridge {{on the west side of}} the school to Spuyten Duyvil was originally planned, but never built. The other access point is at West 230th Street and Tibbett Avenue at the north end of the park, leading to a first floor entrance. The building features a large 22,000-volume library, several gymnasiums, and numerous industrial arts shops. The building also features several escalators and <b>elevator</b> <b>banks.</b> The roof of the school features solar panels, which provide five percent of the structure's electricity. Several portable buildings are located at the north end of the building, used for security offices and extra classrooms. At the south end of the campus near the shore is the athletic complex, featuring a football field circumscribed by a [...] running track, a baseball field, and eight tennis courts. The football field was originally AstroTurf, but now consists of modern artificial turf. The baseball field is dirt and grass.|$|E
