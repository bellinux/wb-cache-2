2500|$|The tower has thirty two lifts for tenants to use, where 8 lifts serve roughly ten {{floors of}} the building. All tenant {{passenger}} lifts serve the ground floor and the following groups of floors – floors 5–17, floors 18–28, floors 28–39 and floors 39–50 (note that level 5 is the first office floor {{and there is no}} level 13). In addition there are 2 firemen's lifts which serve all floors in the building. These have colour designations with blue being in the northeast core of the building and green being in the southwest. From the building's initial construction until late 2009 there were 2 large freight lifts at which point another was added. This lift was built inside a vacant lift shaft and has the designation GL37 (GL for goods lift and 37 as it is the 37th lift in the building). The tower uses 'Gearless Traction Elevators' by Otis. [...] These lifts were installed in 1990 (aside from GL37 – 2009) using a gearless traction machine. [...] They have woven steel cables called hoisting ropes that are attached {{to the top of the}} lift cabin and wrapped around the <b>drive</b> <b>sheave</b> in special grooves. The other ends of the cables are attached to a counterweight that moves up and down in the hoistway on its own guiderails. It takes 40 seconds by lift from lobby to top floor (The Canary Wharf website has not been updated to include the new goods lift GL37).|$|E
50|$|Gearless {{traction}} {{machines are}} low-speed (low-RPM), high-torque electric motors powered either by AC or DC. In this case, the <b>drive</b> <b>sheave</b> is directly {{attached to the}} end of the motor. Gearless traction elevators can reach speeds of up to 4000 ft/min m/s, A brake is mounted between the motor and gearbox or between the motor and <b>drive</b> <b>sheave</b> or at the end of the <b>drive</b> <b>sheave</b> to hold the elevator stationary at a floor. This brake is usually an external drum type and is actuated by spring force and held open electrically; a power failure will cause the brake to engage and prevent the elevator from falling (see inherent safety and safety engineering). But it can also be some form of disc type like 1 or more calipers over a disc in one end of the motor shaft or <b>drive</b> <b>sheave</b> which is used in high speed, high rise and large capacity elevators with machine rooms(an exception is the Kone MonoSpace's EcoDisc which is not high speed, high rise and large capacity and is machine room less but it uses the same design as is a thinner version of a conventional gearless traction machine) for braking power, compactness and redundancy (assuming there's at least 2 calipers on the disc), or 1 or more disc brakes with a single caliper at one end of the motor shaft or <b>drive</b> <b>sheave</b> which is used in machine room less elevators for compactness, braking power, and redundancy (assuming there's 2 brakes or more).|$|E
5000|$|Geared {{traction}} {{machines are}} driven by AC or DC electric motors. Geared machines use worm gears to control mechanical movement of elevator cars by [...] "rolling" [...] steel hoist ropes over a <b>drive</b> <b>sheave</b> which {{is attached to a}} gearbox driven by a high-speed motor. These machines are generally the best option for basement or overhead traction use for speeds up to 500 ft/min m/s.|$|E
50|$|Power is {{transmitted}} from the engine to the drive system through drive belts. Originally, the R22 used four separate v-belts running on multi-groove sheaves. This system proved problematic, as individual belts would sometimes roll over in their groove and fail. As a temporary measure, in 1982, R22 operators received a kit from Robinson that was installed in the cockpit and on the belt tension actuator, isolating the tensioning circuits and locking the clutch/drive system at take-off tension. The problem was ultimately solved by replacing the four individual v-belts with two dual v-belts. The upper, <b>driven</b> <b>sheave</b> is mounted on the main/tail rotor drive shaft incorporating flexible couplings, and is raised and lowered relative to the engine-mounted, driving sheave {{by means of a}} belt tension actuator. During shutdown, the actuator is used to lower the upper sheave to loosen the drive belts. For startup, the engine is started with the belts loose, allowing the engine to run without spinning the rotor system. Immediately after engine start, the clutch switch located in the cockpit is closed by the pilot, powering the actuator to slowly raise the upper sheave to flight position, which tightens the belts. The actuator is thereafter controlled by pressure-sensing column springs, automatically maintaining proper belt tension during flight as the belts wear and stretch. The shaft on which the upper <b>sheave</b> is mounted <b>drives</b> both the main and tail rotors; the main gear box delivers power to the main rotor shaft through a set of splash-lubricated spiral bevel gears.|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} an elevator system comprising an elevator car, a counterweight, a compensation rope affixed at a first {{end to the}} elevator car and at a second end to the counterweight, and a compensation sheave, the compensation rope being wrapped around the compensation sheave, wherein a traction <b>sheave,</b> <b>drives</b> at least one support means supporting the elevator car and the counterweight, the traction sheave being provided with tension means for inducing {{a variation of the}} tension of the compensation rope...|$|R
5000|$|In each case, cables are {{attached}} to a hitch plate {{on top of the}} cab or may be [...] "underslung" [...] below a cab, and then looped over the <b>drive</b> <b>sheave</b> to a counterweight attached to {{the opposite end of the}} cables which reduces the amount of power needed to move the cab. The counterweight is located in the hoist-way and rides a separate railway system; as the car goes up, the counterweight goes down, and vice versa. This action is powered by the traction machine which is directed by the controller, typically a relay logic or computerized device that directs starting, acceleration, deceleration and stopping of the elevator cab. The weight of the counterweight is typically equal to the weight of the elevator cab plus 40-50% of the capacity of the elevator. The grooves in the <b>drive</b> <b>sheave</b> are specially designed to prevent the cables from slipping. [...] "Traction" [...] is provided to the ropes by the grip of the grooves in the sheave, thereby the name. As the ropes age and the traction grooves wear, some traction is lost and the ropes must be replaced and the sheave repaired or replaced. Sheave and rope wear may be significantly reduced by ensuring that all ropes have equal tension, thus sharing the load evenly. Rope tension equalization may be achieved using a rope tension gauge, and is a simple way to extend the lifetime of the sheaves and ropes.|$|E

40|$|This SD {{documents}} {{revision of}} CVI 17443 which changes {{the type of}} motor sheaves driving the K 1 fans in SX farm. This revision documents changing the driver (motor) sheave from a variable pitch to a fixed sheave. The <b>drive</b> <b>sheave</b> is changed {{in response to a}} recommendation from the Equipment Condition Monitoring Group. Changing the variable pitch sheave to a fixed pitch sheave is expected to reduce the vibration of the fan which will prolong the life of the equipment...|$|E
