40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the local loss coefficients {{is important for the}} accurate calculation of ventilation duct pressure loss. In practice, the pressure loss of ventilation duct is very often forecasted, what causes the wrong design of the ventilating fan. A large number of local loss coefficients exist, but the published data are different. The local loss coefficient can be estimated experimentally by the measurement on the real model, or with using of numerical simulation. The paper presents the using of CFD simulation for local loss coefficients of ventilation duct fittings (especially <b>elbows</b> <b>and</b> <b>bends).</b> The simulation results were compared with published data...|$|E

The fold and thrust makes up the framework of the hydrographic network of Pilcomayo and other rivers.

40|$|Classical {{theoretical}} {{treatments for}} diffusional deposition of particles in tube flow describe the losses within straight tubes. The plumbing in many systems of practical interest, notably aerosol instruments, consists of short segments of tubing connected by <b>elbows,</b> <b>bends,</b> <b>and</b> other disturbances. To understand the particle losses in such systems, particle losses in tube flows containing <b>bends</b> <b>and</b> <b>elbows</b> {{has been studied}} for Reynolds numbers ranging from 80 to 950. Monodisperse aerosol of 5 – 15 nm diameter particles passed through individual <b>bends</b> or <b>elbows,</b> <b>and</b> {{through a number of}} bends or elbows in series. The results show that the effect of <b>bends</b> <b>and</b> <b>elbows</b> on particle diffusion loss is significant. For a flow configuration with four elbows in series, the penetration efficiency drops as much as 44 % when compared to a straight tube with the same length. For Reynolds number smaller than 250, the enhancement of diffusion losses due to <b>bends</b> <b>and</b> <b>elbows</b> is sensitive to both the relative orientations of the <b>bends</b> <b>and</b> <b>elbows</b> <b>and</b> the lengths of straight tubing between them. Because of this sensitivity, direct calibration or simulation is required to assess nanoparticle penetration efficiencies for any flow system containing bends or elbows at low Reynolds number. When the Reynolds number exceeds 250, the enhancement is insensitive to the actual flow configurations. Experimental results are presented, which may be useful for design of aerosol flow systems at Reynolds number larger than 250...|$|R
40|$|Wearable sensors for {{detection}} of human activities have encouraged {{the development of}} highly elastic sensors. In particular, to capture subtle and large-scale body motion, stretchable and wide-range strain sensors are highly desired, but still a challenge. Herein, a highly stretchable and transparent stain sensor based on ionic liquids and elastic polymer has been developed. The as-obtained sensor exhibits impressive stretchability with wide-range strain (from 0. 1 % to 400 %), good <b>bending</b> properties <b>and</b> high sensitivity, whose gauge factor can reach 7. 9. Importantly, the sensors show excellent biological compatibility and succeed in monitoring the diverse human activities ranging from the complex large-scale multidimensional motions to subtle signals, including wrist, finger <b>and</b> <b>elbow</b> joint <b>bending,</b> finger touch, breath, speech, swallow behavior and pulse wave...|$|R

40|$|Exercising {{is one of}} {{the three}} {{cornerstones}} in the treatment of lymphedema together with contention mechanisms and lymphatic drainage. The aim of the current study was to evaluate a new method of mechanic lymphatic drainage. Volumetric reductions were evaluated after passive exercises in 25 patients with arm lymphedema resulting from breast cancer treatment. Their ages ranged between 42 and 86 years old. All patients were submitted to one-hour sessions using the RAGodoy &# 174; electromechanical apparatus which performs from 15 to 25 <b>elbow</b> <b>bending</b> <b>and</b> stretching exercises per minute. Volumetry, using the water displacement technique, was performed before and after the sessions. The paired t-test was employed for statistical analysis with an alpha error of less than 5 &#x 0025; being considered acceptable. The reduction in volume was significant (P -value < 0. 001) with a mean initial volume of 2026. 4 and final volume of 1967. 2 giving a mean loss of 59. 2 mL. The RAGodoy &# 174; apparatus was efficient to reduce the volume of lymphedematous arms and is an option for the treatment of lymphedema...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} eccentric exercise on position sense and reaction angle of the <b>elbow</b> <b>and</b> knee flexors. Twelve males underwent two eccentric exercise sessions involving a randomized crossover design. In the first session participants used their <b>elbow</b> flexors <b>and</b> in the other session their knee flexors. Muscle damage indices, position sense, and joint reaction angle to release of the <b>elbow</b> <b>and</b> knee flexors were measured before, immediately after, and up to 7 days after exercise. Exercise induced greater muscle damage in the elbow flexors than knee flexors. Exercise disturbed position sense of the <b>elbow</b> <b>and</b> knee joint. For both limbs, the participants adopted a more extended position than the reference angle. The <b>elbow</b> <b>and</b> knee joint reaction angles to release increased after exercise for both the <b>elbow</b> <b>and</b> knee flexors. The disturbances in position sense and reaction angle after exercise were greater in the elbow flexors than knee flexors. The elbow flexors remained more accurate and faster than the knee flexors at all time points. These results {{may be explained by}} the higher density of muscle spindles and the lower innervation ratio of the elbow flexors compared with the knee flexors, as well as the fact that the arms are more accustomed than the legs to perform fast and accurate movements...|$|R
