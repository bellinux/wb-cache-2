40|$|In fleshy fruits, the {{variability}} of cell morphology at the <b>fruit</b> <b>scale</b> is largely unknown. It presents both a huge variability and {{a high level of}} organization. Better knowledge of cell morphology heterogeneity within the fruit is necessary to understand fruit development, to model fruit mechanical behaviour, or to investigate variations of physico-chemical measurements. A generic approach is proposed to build cartographies of cell morphology at the <b>fruit</b> <b>scale,</b> which depict regions corresponding to different cell morphologies. The approach is based on: (1) sampling the whole fruit at known positions; (2) imaging and quantifying local cell morphology; (3) pooling measurements to take biological variability into account and (4) projecting results in a morphology model of the whole fruit. The result is a synthetic representation of cell morphology variations within the whole fruit. The method was applied to the characterization of cell morphology in tomato pericarp. Two different imaging scales that provided complementary descriptions were used: 3 D confocal microscopy and macroscopy. The approach is generic and can be adapted to other fruits or other products...|$|R

40|$|<b>European</b> <b>fruit</b> tree canker, {{caused by}} Nectria galligena, {{is a major}} disease in organic apple cultivation. No copper {{can be used in}} Denmark and the Netherlands to control the disease. Removal of cankers is the only {{remaining}} method to control the disease. Slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) was applied at 50 or 100 kg/ha three times during the leaf fall period to protect apple trees against the disease. Experiments under high inoculum pressure showed a reduction in newly formed cankers of 57, 35 and 60 % with respect to untreated for 3 years respectively. The chemical standard thiophanate-methyl further reduced the number of newly formed cankers by 99, 60 and 89 % with respect to untreated for these 3 years respectively in these experiments. These results showed that slaked lime was less efficacious than the chemical standard under these high inoculum pressure circumstances. Demonstration experiments showed an efficacy of 70 and 68 % for slaked lime and 62 and 62 % for the conventional standard (carbendazim and captan) with respect to untreated controls in 2 years respectively. The demonstration experiments, done in commercial orchards and under normal inoculum pressure, showed a similar efficacy as the conventional standard. It is concluded that the use of slaked lime to control <b>European</b> <b>fruit</b> tree canker can contribute to a more economic organic apple and pear production in temperate climate zones...|$|R
40|$|<b>European</b> <b>fruit</b> tree canker, {{caused by}} Neonectria ditissima, is an {{important}} disease of pome fruit worldwide. Apple cultivars differ in their levels of susceptibility to N. ditissima. In order to design an effective plant resistance test, we examined the effectiveness of two resistance parameters: infection frequency and lesion growth. Both parameters were evaluated in parallel tests using 10 apple cultivars in three experimental years, applying seminatural infection of leaf scars (infection frequency) or inoculation of artificial wounds (lesion growth). We compared six parameters for lesion growth, of which a new parameter, lesion growth rate (LGR), {{appeared to be the}} best with respect to reproducibility and statistical significance. LGR is defined as the slope of the regression of lesion size versus time. The slope was estimated for each lesion, employing a common start date and a lesion-specific end date determined by the girdling of the lesion. The two parameters (infection frequency and LGR) were examined in separate experiments and in three successive years, and provided complementary information and resulted in reproducible conclusions on the relative resistance levels to N. ditissima of the tested cultivars. The presented methods can be used to develop strategies for the control of <b>European</b> <b>fruit</b> tree canker (e. g., in the breeding of new apple cultivars with high levels of resistance to N. ditissima) ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Growing {{demand in}} Europe for healthy and nutritious food and {{beverage}} products with new flavours creates opportunities for supplying the European market with novel fruit juices including tropical fruits like acai (Euterpe oleracea Mart.). Materials and methods. One tropical fruit species from Brazil, i. e., acai, was selected as a case species. Via expert interviews, a review of consumer studies regarding tropical fruit consumption, field visits and literature research, a SWOT analysis was conducted in order to map the opportunities, threats, strengths and weaknesses related to acai and its potential in the West <b>European</b> <b>fruit</b> juice industry. Results. Opportunities stem from growing consumer interest in natural, healthy and nutritious fruit juices, the need for health-oriented innovations in the food industry and growing interest in variety, novel tastes and ethnic foods. Unfamiliarity, health claim credibility and European market access requirements constitute the main threats. Strengths pertain to the nutritional value of acai and its tropical origin, {{and the existence of}} well-established national acai markets and processing industries. Weaknesses result from the irregular supply and inconsistent acai quality, lack of advanced know-how in cultivation and processing issues, and scant insights into the fruit's nutrient profile. Conclusion. The findings indicate that acai, which has outstanding nutritional values and health-related benefits, could have substantial potential in the West <b>European</b> <b>fruit</b> juice market. Key attention points pertain to creating awareness among consumers and building familiarity with acai and its products, and obtaining in-depth knowledge about its nutritional characteristics and concomitant health benefits...|$|R

40|$|Light {{distribution}} within {{fruit trees}} {{has a major}} influence on the distribution of fruit quality and diseases. A method for estimating light partitioning at the intra-tree canopy scale is presented. It is based on the three-dimensional (3 D) reconstruction of the tree canopy at the organ scale. First, the trees are 3 D-digitised with a magnetic device at current-year shoot scale. Second, shoot foliage is 3 D-reconstructed by using allometric relationships and leaf angle distributions built from sampled shoot digitising at leaf scale. Third, false colours are attributed to plant components, e. g., shoot types, in order to distinguish them on the virtual plant images. Fourth, orchard scenes are created with a coloured target tree at the centre and black neighbour trees shading the target tree. Fifth, images of the virtual scene are created with view directions set to those of the light sources, namely according to the sun course for direct radiation and a set of sampled directions over the sky hemisphere for diffuse radiation. Sixth, light interception by each coloured plant component is computed from processing the scene images, namely coloured pixels counts. The method was used with eighteen 13 -year-old Golden Delicious apple trees trained in vertical axis, ycare and drilling systems. Light interception was computed at <b>fruit</b> <b>scale</b> (using one colour per fruit). As an indirect validation of the method, simulated fruit irradiance was related to actual fruit sugar content. At the individual <b>fruit</b> <b>scale,</b> r² coefficients were about 0. 3 – 0. 4. After grouping fruits in irradiance classes, r² coefficients were mostly above 0. 85. The method was therefore found suitable for estimating light distribution within fruit trees...|$|R
