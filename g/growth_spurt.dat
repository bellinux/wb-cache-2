He played {{baseball}} as a shortstop and outfielder, {{but was not}} highly regarded as a prospect. He went unnoticed by scouts until he experienced a <b>growth</b> <b>spurt</b> {{at the age of}} 15.

5|$|Unemployment {{resulting}} from the Great Depression caused unrest. The industrial <b>growth</b> <b>spurt</b> of the 1930s gradually slowed. The economic conditions of the 1930s contributed {{to the process of}} internal migration from the countryside and smaller towns to the cities, especially Buenos Aires, where there were greater opportunities for employment. The urban working classes led several unsuccessful uprisings prior to the 1937 presidential elections. Traditional export agriculture stagnated at the outbreak of World War II and remained sluggish.|$|E
5|$|Beckett grew up idolizing fellow Texans Nolan Ryan and Roger Clemens. As a youth, he starred on Little League All-Star teams. He later {{attended}} Spring High School in Spring, Texas. He {{had trouble}} with grades and {{not paying attention to}} his coach during his freshman year. His coach was so frustrated with him he threw him off the team. He went through a <b>growth</b> <b>spurt</b> before his sophomore year and added speed to his fastball.

50|$|Short-term growth {{consists}} of small <b>growth</b> <b>spurts</b> (mini <b>growth</b> <b>spurts).</b> In the human neonate, these spurts occur at intervals of 2 to 10 days, and they reach maximum velocities {{of up to}} 0.2 mm per hour at the lower leg. Growth hormone therapies {{have been shown to}} significantly alter the dynamics of short-term growth. Catch-up growth (compensatory growth after periods of growth impairment due to illness, starvation and other unfavourable conditions) is characterised by repetitive series of broadened mini <b>growth</b> <b>spurts.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{new evidence}} {{on the existence of}} pre-industrial <b>growth</b> <b>spurts</b> and the nature of economic growth during the transition from Malthus to Solow. In this research, <b>growth</b> <b>spurts</b> are an intrinsic feature of the economy, but throughout history their effect on standards of living is mostly temporary. Sustained rises in living standards only become sustained when there are complementarities between the triple engines of growth of technological development, human capital and the organization of the workplace. In Malthusian economies, most technologies were basic and only required straightforward knowledge or human capital, and thus the skill-technology complementarity did not play a role in their development. As a consequence, most technological developments in Malthusian economies generated <b>growth</b> <b>spurts</b> that did not become sustained, although there was a temporary increase in standards of living. However, the increasing complexity of the epistemic knowledge base reported by the historical literature meant that investments in applied technology were progressively more significant, enhancing the role of human capital. After a certain threshold of the knowledge base was surpassed, more and more complex applied technologies were developed, and <b>growth</b> <b>spurts</b> became permanent features of the economy. <b>Growth</b> <b>spurts,</b> unified <b>growth</b> theory, sustained economic growth...|$|R
5|$|Forster {{was born}} in Hexham, Northumberland, the son of Brian Clive Forster QC (who later became a circuit judge), and {{attended}} the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle, but did not begin playing as a goalkeeper until he was 13 years old. Before then he had mainly played either rugby union or cricket. Coaches initially thought Forster might be too small to play as a goalkeeper, although he played for local junior team Stocksfield before joining the renowned Wallsend Boys Club. However, he entered a significant <b>growth</b> <b>spurt</b> at 15 {{years of age and}} later signed with Newcastle United.|$|E
5|$|Glencross {{was born}} December 28, 1982, in Kindersley, Saskatchewan, but {{grew up in}} Provost, Alberta. He {{is the son of}} Mel and Robin Glencross, and has a younger brother, Matthew, and sister, Kari. His parents both played hockey and say he {{inherited}} an intense competitive nature from them. His family moved to Red Deer, Alberta when he was a teenager as his parents began a livestock auction business. Glencross was small for his age, standing less than five feet tall when he was15, and as a result was often left off the top teams in minor hockey despite having the talent to play; he played Midget C hockey in Provost. He experienced a rapid <b>growth</b> <b>spurt,</b> growing a full foot in a period of 17months, and was recruited to play Junior A hockey for the expansion Brooks Bandits of the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL) in 2000. He {{went on to become the}} first Bandit alumnus to play in the National Hockey League (NHL), and his number 17 was retired by the team in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Another study corroborated {{the latter}} study's results but found {{the growth rate}} to be much faster, finding it to be around 1800 {{kilograms}} (4000lbs). Although these results were much higher than previous estimations, the authors noted that these results significantly lowered the great difference between its actual growth rate and the one which would be expected of an animal of its size. The sudden change in growth rate {{at the end of}} the <b>growth</b> <b>spurt</b> may indicate physical maturity, a hypothesis which is supported by the discovery of medullary tissue in the femur of a 16 to 20-year-old Tyrannosaurus rex from Montana (MOR 1125, also known as B-rex). Medullary tissue is found only in female birds during ovulation, indicating that B-rex was of reproductive age. Further study indicates an age of 18 for this specimen. In 2016, it was finally confirmed by Mary Higby Schweitzer and Lindsay Zanno et al that the soft tissue within the femur of MOR 1125 was medullary tissue. This also confirmed the identity of the specimen as a female. The discovery of medullary bone tissue within Tyrannosaurus may prove valuable in determining the sex of other dinosaur species in future examinations, as the chemical makeup of medullary tissue is unmistakable. Other tyrannosaurids exhibit extremely similar growth curves, although with lower growth rates corresponding to their lower adult sizes.|$|E

5|$|Returning {{head coach}} Slavoljub Muslin brought Žigić into Red Star's senior squad for the 2003–04 First League season, {{and gave him}} his debut in the {{starting}} eleven on the opening day. That first game ended in defeat, and Žigić's physical appearance– a <b>growth</b> <b>spurt</b> {{from the age of}} 16 had brought his height to – provoked suggestions that he might be better suited to basketball. He scored the second goal as they beat Hajduk Kula 2–0 in the next league match. In between, he produced a hat-trick against Nistru in the 2003–04 UEFA Cup qualifying round, and went on to contribute a further three goals as Red Star beat Odense 6–5 on aggregate in the first round. He scored twice in the 3–0 win in the Eternal Derby against Partizan, and celebrated by miming a basketball shot. By the mid-season break, he had 12 league goals as well as the 6 in the UEFA Cup, and was named Player of the Year for 2003, both by the captains of the First League teams voting via the Večernje novosti newspaper and by the Football Association. He finished the season as the league's top scorer, with 18, as Red Star won their 23rd title, and scored the winning goal in the cup final.|$|E

25|$|The {{adolescent}} <b>growth</b> <b>spurt</b> is a {{rapid increase}} in the individual's height and weight during puberty resulting from the simultaneous release of growth hormones, thyroid hormones, and androgens. Males experience their <b>growth</b> <b>spurt</b> about two years later, on average, than females. During their peak height velocity (the time of most rapid growth), adolescents grow at a growth rate nearly identical {{to that of a}} toddler—about 4inches (10.3cm) a year for males and 3.5inches (9cm) for females. In addition to changes in height, adolescents also experience a significant increase in weight (Marshall, 1978). The weight gained during adolescence constitutes nearly half of one's adult body weight. Teenage and early adult males may continue to gain natural muscle growth even after puberty.|$|E

40|$|The recent {{literature}} on unified growth theory has shed {{new light on}} the transition to sustained economic growth. Nevertheless, unified growth theory has not devoted {{a lot of attention to}} the nature of economic growth and its impact in the transition from Malthus to Solow. This research presents new evidence on the existence of pre-industrial <b>growth</b> <b>spurts</b> and provides new foundations concerning the nature of economic growth during the Malthus to Solow transition. Following previous research in unified growth theory, sustained economic growth arises due to complementarities between the triple engines of growth of technological development, human capital and the organization of the workplace. In this research, <b>growth</b> <b>spurts</b> are an intrinsic feature of the economy, but throughout history their effect on standards of living is mostly temporary. The rise in living standards only becomes sustained when the complementarity of the triple engines of growth emerges.

25|$|The {{hormone that}} dominates female {{development}} is an estrogen called estradiol. While estradiol promotes {{growth of the}} breasts and uterus, {{it is also the}} principal hormone driving the pubertal <b>growth</b> <b>spurt</b> and epiphyseal maturation and closure. Estradiol levels rise earlier and reach higher levels in women than in men.|$|E
25|$|Estrogens are {{responsible}} for both the pubertal <b>growth</b> <b>spurt,</b> which causes an acceleration in linear growth, and epiphyseal closure, which limits height and limb length, in both females and males. In addition, estrogens {{are responsible}} for bone maturation and maintenance of bone mineral density throughout life. Due to hypoestrogenism, the risk of osteoporosis increases during menopause.|$|E

25|$|Secondary {{scoliosis}} due to neuropathic and myopathic {{conditions can}} lead to a loss of muscular support for the spinal column so that the spinal column is pulled in abnormal directions. Some conditions which may cause secondary scoliosis include muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy, poliomyelitis, cerebral palsy, spinal cord trauma, and myotonia. Scoliosis often presents itself, or worsens, during an adolescent's <b>growth</b> <b>spurt</b> and is more often diagnosed in females than males.|$|E
25|$|Generally, the {{prognosis}} of scoliosis depends on the likelihood of progression. The general rules of progression are larger curves carry {{a higher risk of}} progression than smaller curves, and thoracic and double primary curves carry a higher risk of progression than single lumbar or thoracolumbar curves. In addition, patients not having yet reached skeletal maturity have a higher likelihood of progression (i.e., if the patient has not yet completed the adolescent <b>growth</b> <b>spurt).</b>|$|E
25|$|However, a {{significant}} portion of testosterone in adolescent boys is converted to estradiol.
