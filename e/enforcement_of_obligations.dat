A New Zealand understanding of these standard international obligations is influenced by New Zealand’s ethical culture. New Zealand arbitrators practicing overseas must recognise how their culture affects their approach to ethical obligations. In particular, they must be aware that a New Zealand approach to impartiality and independence {{may be seen as}} relaxed by those outside New Zealand.

40|$|International audienceObligations are {{generally}} actions that users {{are required to}} take and are essential for the expression {{of a large number of}} requirements. For instance, obligation actions may represent prerequisites to gain some privilege (pre obligations), to satisfy some ongoing or post requirement for resource usage (ongoing and post obligations), or to adhere to some privacy or availability policy. Obligations may also define states of affairs which should be maintained. An example <b>of</b> such <b>obligations</b> is the obligation "doctors should remain alert while in the operating room". In this paper, we introduce a formal framework for the management and <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligation</b> policies. The framework is formalized using concepts from action specification languages and the Event Condition Action paradigm of active databases. Therefore, our framework allows reasoning about change in the state <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> and, at the same time, provides declarative formal semantics for their enforcement. In this framework, we support many types <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> and show how to manage obligation activation, fulfillment and violation...|$|R
40|$|There {{is a long}} legal {{tradition}} of presuming paternity regardless of any biological evidence of the fact. Of course, the common law presumption as to paternity is only {{the flip side of}} the legitimacy presumption, and it has been the latter that, in the past, attracted greater legal notice. The presumption of legitimacy arising from marriage brought with it considerable advantage for the child concerned and certainty for the father, at least in regard to the disposition of his assets. With the modern erosion of the significance of legitimacy, and the redefinition, and greater <b>enforcement,</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> of parents to support their children, it is now paternity, rather than legitimacy, which is of paramount legal significance. One complex legal question which has arisen in recent years in relation to paternity is whether a man can use the tort of deceit to sue the mother of a child who has misled him as to paternity, where paternity is later disestablished...|$|E

40|$|The WTO Dispute Settlement System {{aimed to}} curb unilateralism by {{establishing}} a multilateral process operating {{under the aegis of}} the WTO as the exclusive forum for WTO adjudication. Intuitively, one would expect that those negatively affected by the curtailing of their power to unilaterally do justice for themselves, would agree to multilateral resolution of disputes if the established regime could guarantee <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> in comparable terms (to unilateral enforcement). In this perspective, respect and guarantee of reciprocal commitments is the key ingredient. Reciprocal commitments entered should not be unilaterally undone through the commission of illegalities. There are good reasons to doubt whether the WTO regime as it now stands guarantees reciprocity following the commitment of illegalities. It is probably more accurate to argue that the WTO regime serves ‘diffuse’ as opposed to ‘specific’ reciprocity. Still, WTO Members continue to routinely submit their disputes to the WTO adjudicating fora, lending support to the argument that the regime after all, was meant to curb punishment, and not to punish...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to clarify the status in {{international}} law of countermeasures by non-injured States in the enforcement of norms protecting fundamental community values. For this purpose, the thesis examines two sub-questions: First, whether {{and to what extent}} countermeasures by non-injured States as a response to violations of obligations erga omnes are tolerated in contemporary international law. By employing the concept of toleration introduced by Judge Simma in his separate declaration in the ICJ s 2010 Advisory Opinion, {{the question is not whether}} countermeasures in the general interest are legal, but rather whether they are not illegal. Understood as a property of fundamental norms, instantiations of obligations erga omnes are more easily identified through the better-developed concept of jus cogens. The prohibitions on genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity are all peremptory norms owed erga omnes. In addition, the prohibition on genocide entails a positive extra-territorial duty to prevent genocide and there are indications that the same applies to serious war crimes and crimes against humanity. Despite the International Law Commission s compromise solution in its 2001 Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, existing State practice and opinio juris reveal a strong argument for the toleration of countermeasures by non-injured States in response to serious breaches of peremptory norms. Further, the legal regime regulating the measures and State practice do not lend strong support to the arguments against countermeasures in the general interest based on the risks of abuse inherent in self-assertion. Lastly, although international law contains a framework for extending countermeasures beyond principally responsible States, this extension reveals some legitimacy concerns for countermeasures by non-injured States in the general interest. The second sub-question of the thesis deals with the relationship between individual measures and collective <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> erga omnes. It examines enforcement through the United Nations (UN) in light of the Responsibility to Protect policy developed since the 2005 World Summit. In this respect, the public law ideal of collective enforcement of community norms leaves a residual role for individual measures. Furthermore, in cases where there is need to coordinate responses or secure legitimacy, the UN General Assembly is competent to assume a more prominent role in recommending individual countermeasures by non-injured States...|$|E

This symposium essay explores whether this practice violates the Thirteenth Amendment’s ban on involuntary servitude. At first glance, such threats fall squarely within the ambit of the early 20 th century peonage cases. There, the Supreme Court struck down criminal <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> legal <b>obligations</b> to work off a debt. Several modern courts have declined to reach a similar conclusion when child support enforcement puts obligors to a choice between paying, working, and going to jail.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my thesis is to analyze a {{position}} of an entitled person in the process <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>obligation,</b> which was adjudged by a judicial decision and wasn't fulfilled by an obliged person voluntarily. The paper {{is focused on the}} <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> private, pecuniary <b>obligations.</b> Execution procedure and all described institutes are observed from the entitled person's point of view, particularly with regard to her fundamental effort to satisfy her claim. The thesis also deals with the entitled person's options to face the obliged person's means of defense, especially deferral and discontinuance of the execution. The aim is to evaluate the current legislation's adjustment of the position of the entitled person and to try to suggest possibilities of change which could provide more effective execution for the entitled person while preserving the obliged person's rights. The thesis is divided into four chapters. The first one presents the position of the topic in the system of law and introduces the subject and the characteristic of the main terms: the execution and the entitled person.

On 13 th November 1964, in Commission v.

Drawing on writings by Robert Lecourt, Paul Reuter, and Paul Kapteyn, this paper demonstrates that a direct causal link between these three cases was recognized by ECJ judges and legal scholars as early as 1965. The historical evidence presented here therefore supports previous comparative analysis that has argued that these three decisions – Van Gend, Costa, and Luxembourg & Belgium – should be acknowledged as profoundly inter-connected, in that national court application <b>of</b> European <b>obligations</b> should {{be understood as a}} substitute for the <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> European <b>obligations</b> through inter-state countermeasures...|$|R
