30|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} explanations for the higher rate of complete answers and for the reduced need for reminders in the IVR group. IVR requires an immediate answer, while the postal survey may easily be postponed or forgotten. Automated telephony is probably more challenging and offers less opportunity to omit certain items. The IVR responses are delivered instantly, while subjects in the other group {{have to put in}} additional effort to physically complete and then post the questionnaire. The reason for the reduced time consumption for the respondents compared to that estimated for <b>a</b> clinical <b>phone</b> <b>interview</b> is probably that initial 'small talk’ and comments between the answers <b>in</b> <b>a</b> person-to-person <b>phone</b> <b>interview</b> are omitted in the IVR procedure. The IVR superiority may increase the probability that treatment is actually evaluated, thereby releasing more time for clinical work for the trained clinicians.|$|R

Geffen Records released a statement mentioning that the label's share of royalties would be donated to the Doris Tate Crime Victims Bureau.
