The method includes detecting back scattered primary ions, low energy ejected species, and high energy ejected species by ion beam surface analysis techniques comprising positioning a ToF SIMS/MSRI mass analyzer at a predetermined angle {theta}, where {theta} is the angle between the horizontal axis of the mass analyzer and the unreflected primary ion beam line, and applying a specific voltage to the <b>back</b> <b>ring</b> of the analyzer.

Proper management of this pest requires timely scouting, correct identification, determination of population levels, and if necessary, cutting the hay or spraying an insecticide. Alfalfa weevil larvae can be very destructive to first-cutting alfalfa, so fields should be scouted. Larvae remove leaf tissue, beginning with the new leaves at the top of the plant, then work down the stem to other leaves. This feeding reduces forage quality and quantity...|$|R

Produced and sold from 1977 (by Sebring-Vanguard) to 1979 (by Commuter Vehicles, Inc.), basically unchanged. It is rumored that only 11 of these smaller Vans were built and sold as the CitiVan but an unknown more were built and sold in 1979 as the first year Comuta-Van. The main design differences between the 1979 Comuta-Van and the later Postal Comuta-Van is that the much smaller 1979 Comuta-Van has swing out side doors and a <b>hatch</b> <b>back</b> window. The much larger Postal Comuta-Van has sliding side doors and a swing out rear entrance door.|$|R

40|$|Compliant {{contacting}} filament seals such as {{brush seals}} {{are well known}} to give improved leakage performance and hence specific fuel consumption benefit compared to labyrinth seals. The design of the brush seal must be robust {{across a range of}} operating pressures, rotor speeds, and radial build-offset tolerances. Importantly the wear characteristics of the seal must be well understood to allow a secondary air system suitable for operation over the entire engine life to be designed. A test rig at the University of Oxford is described which was developed for the testing of brush seals at engine-representative speeds, pressures, and seal housing eccentricities. The test rig allows the leakage, torque, and temperature rise in the rotor to be characterized as functions of the differential pressure(s) across the seal and the speed of rotation. Tests were run on two different geometries of bristle pack with conventional, passive, and active pressure-balanced <b>backing</b> <b>ring</b> configurations. Comparison of the experimental results indicates that the hysteresis inherent in conventional brush seal design could compromise performance (due to increased leakage) or life (due to exacerbated wear) as a result of reduced compliance. The inclusion of active pressure-balanced <b>backing</b> <b>rings</b> in the seal designs are shown to alleviate the problem of bristle–backing ring friction, but this is associated with increased blow-down forces which could result in a significant seal-life penalty. The best performing seal was concluded to be the passive pressure-balanced configuration, which achieves the best compromise between leakage and seal torque. Seals incorporating passive pressure-balanced <b>backing</b> <b>rings</b> are also shown to have improved heat transfer performance in comparison to other design...|$|R

40|$|Tightness of flange joints {{for large}} {{polyethylene}} pipes –Part 1 Numerical simulations Leaks occasionally occur in flange joints in plastic pipelines, predominantly large dimension ones. Such pipelines are normally {{of importance for}} e g water supply, and repair is expensive. A better understanding is vital since a clear background is missing for the existing design and mounting recommendations, which also are differing. Analysis of plastic flanges {{is more complicated than}} for metal ones since the material is time dependent, and much softer than the <b>backing</b> <b>rings</b> and bolts. The aim of this work was to be able to assess on one hand if presently standardized flange geometries mean smaller safety margins when the size of the pipe is increased, {{and on the other hand}} if the instructions for mounting have to be improved. First, an analysis was made by manual calculations, without consideration of the time dependent properties of the material, in order to assess the stresses just after tightening of the joint but before pressurizing and start of service time of the pipeline. The manualanalysis is of course misleading for assessment of the compression stresses in the flange surfaces over time, although it seems that such calculations often are used for design. The value of the manual analysis was mainly that it showed that the nominal stresses aresimilar for different sizes, except for the 630 mm pipe where they are significantly higher. Further it was established that pressurizing of the pipe means a moderate influence on the flange stresses and bolt forces, 10 - 15 %, and that the bolt and <b>backing</b> <b>ring</b> are much stiffer than the plastic flange, meaning that it is mainly relaxation that is responsible forunloading of the joint over time. Computer simulations (FEM) were then made of both the tightening and the service phase for a set of geometries, and with a material model including time dependent properties of the plastic parts of the joint using material data from in-house experiments. Although the computer simulations are approximate too, they give a much better impression both of the principal function of the joint and of the magnitude of the stresses over time. It appears that the geometry of the flange joint means that the contact is lost over large parts of the flange surfaces already at pressurizing and that a triangulardistribution of pressure covering a part of the flange surface corresponding to the width of the <b>backing</b> <b>ring</b> is developed over time which should be sufficient to keep the joint tight. The effects of gaskets and profiled, softer, <b>backing</b> <b>rings</b> are clarified, and it is indicated that re-tightening is an efficient way to improve the function of the joint over time. Further, it seems that there is no significant difference in behaviour, as regards flange pressure, between SDR 11 and SDR 17 geometries. So, the FEM investigation has revealed that intuitive thoughts about reasons for inferior functioning of large size flange joints in plastic pipes are not well founded. The most efficient way to improve the joint is to increase the bolt force and to keep it up,by re-tightening or by flexible <b>backing</b> <b>rings.</b> Gaskets, soft ones, may be beneficial for reducing unevenness of the plastic joint surfaces...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{experimental}} programme and a CFD based mathematical model using a brush seal at two bristle to rotor clearances (0, 27 mm. and 0, 75 mm.), are presented. The experimental programme examined the radial pressure distributions along the <b>backing</b> <b>ring,</b> the axial pressure distribution along the rotor, {{and the mass}} flow through the seal, through a range of pressure ratios while exhausting to atmosphere. The results from this experimental programme {{have been used to}} further calibrate a CFD based model. This model treats the bristle pack as an axisymmetric, anisotropic porous region, and is calibrated by the definition of non-linear resistance coefficients in three orthogonal directions. The CFD analysis calculates the aerodynamic forces on the bristles, which are subsequently used in a separate program to estimate the bristle movements, stresses and bristle and rotor loads. The analysis shows that a brush seal with a build clearance produces a very different flow field within the bristle pack to one with an interference, and the need to understand the bulk movements of the bristles. These are shown to be affected by the level of friction between the bristles and the <b>backing</b> <b>ring,</b> which has an important effect on the bristles wear and seal leakage characteristics...|$|R
