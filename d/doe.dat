5|$|<b>Doe</b> {{was born}} in Reading, Berkshire. As a youth player, he played as a forward for AFC Newbury and Newbury and District Schools {{alongside}} Theo Walcott, before the duo signed for Swindon Town. They played together for four years. He said in one season, that his partnership with Walcott consisted of them scoring about 150 goals. During a tournament in Cardiff, <b>Doe</b> was converted into a centre-back. <b>Doe</b> was with Swindon Town {{from the age of}} 10, until he was deemed surplus to requirements by manager Paul Sturrock, and he left in July 2007.|$|E

5|$|<b>Doe</b> {{started his}} career with Swindon Town as a youth player before joining Conference Premier club Weymouth. In February 2009, he left Weymouth due to {{financial}} problems at the club and registered with Kettering Town {{to allow him to}} join Dagenham & Redbridge on loan {{until the end of the}} 2008–09 season. He was refused permission to join Dagenham on a permanent basis by The Football Association as the move was outside the transfer window. <b>Doe</b> has also represented the England C team, making one appearance against Malta under-21s.|$|E

50|$|<b>DOE's</b> and BNL's {{investigation}} {{of this incident}} concluded that the tritium had been leaking {{for as long as}} 12 years without <b>DOE's</b> or BNL's knowledge. Installing wells that could have detected the leak was first discussed by BNL engineers in 1993, but the wells were not completed until 1996. The resulting controversy about both BNL's handling of the tritium leak and perceived lapses in <b>DOE's</b> oversight led to the termination of AUI as the BNL contractor in May 1997.|$|R

5|$|The AFL became {{involved}} in politics when seventeen soldiers launched a coup on April 12, 1980. The group {{was made up of}} Master Sergeant Samuel <b>Doe,</b> two staff sergeants, four sergeants, eight corporals, and two privates. They found President Tolbert sleeping in his office in the Executive Mansion and there they killed him. While then-Sergeant Thomas Quiwonkpa led the plotters, it was the group led by Samuel <b>Doe</b> that found Tolbert in his office, and it was <b>Doe,</b> as a master sergeant the highest ranking of the group, who went on the radio the next day to announce the overthrow of the long-entrenched True Whig Party government.|$|E
5|$|When The Daily Californian {{published}} {{excerpts from}} the Argonne letter on June 11, the <b>DOE</b> obtained {{a court order to}} prevent further publication. Undeterred, The Daily Californian published the letter in its entirety on June 13. In September, the <b>DOE</b> declared the Hansen letter to be classified and obtained a temporary restraining order prohibiting The Daily Californian from publishing it, but the Hansen letter was published by the Madison Press Connection on September 16. The government then moved to dismiss their cases against both The Progressive and The Daily Californian as moot.|$|E

5|$|Henry Dubar (who {{had helped}} recruit <b>Doe</b> {{personally}} years before) was promoted in one leap from captain to lieutenant general as Chief of Staff.

5|$|Simone {{was created}} {{as a part of}} the show's effort to {{represent}} a complete African-American family and fully realized African-American characters on television. Conceived by the soap's founder and head writer James E.

The exact reasons behind Cardwell's departure remain unknown; Pharris chose to leave to pursue other acting opportunities. <b>Doe</b> was the third and final actress to play Simone before the character was written off the show shortly before its transition to DirecTV.|$|E
