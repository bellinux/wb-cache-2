Lack of strong identification results in unauthorized entities {{access to the}} sensitive data, and leads to loos of confidentiality and integrity, which causes many vulnerabilities and attacks in the network. We present the {{key management}} scheme as a combination of Identity-Based (User’s Identification), Unique Transmission’s time Factor and Threshold Cryptography for ad hoc networks. It is a certificateless solution which {{eliminates the need for}} public key distribution and certificates in public key management schemes.

40|$|The {{online banking}} {{environment}} has grown tremendously {{over the past}} several years and will continue to grow as financial institutions continue to strive to allow customers to complete money transfers, pay bills, and access critical information online. During this same time, online banking has been plagued by Internet criminals and fraudsters attempting to steal customer information. Phishing, pharming, and other types of attacks have become well known and are widely used as a means for fraudsters to obtain information from customers and access online banking accounts. As a result, authenticating customers logging onto their online banking service has become a crucial concern of financial institutions. This research study portrays a clear picture of the need for <b>enhanced</b> <b>authentication</b> in online banking. It presents the main security concerns and criminal activities that are driving the need for stronger authentication, as well as showing the growth of the online channel that is being driven by consumers and financial institutions.

30|$|As {{networks}} become larger, more complex, {{and more}} distributed, information security {{has become more}} critical {{than it has ever}} been in the past. Many efforts have been made aiming to accurately authenticate and authorize trusted individuals, and audit their activities. Once a user is successfully logged in, the prevailing technique assumes that the system is controlled by the same person. Focusing on this security challenge, we developed an <b>enhanced</b> <b>authentication</b> method that uses video-based facial recognition technology to monitor the user during the entire session in which the person is using the system. It can automatically lock the screen or log out the user when the authenticated user's face disappears from the vicinity of the computer system for an adjustable time interval.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- This paper proposes an <b>enhanced</b> <b>authentication</b> model, {{which is}} {{suitable}} for low-power mobile devices. It uses an Extended Password Key Exchange Protocols [2] and elliptic-curve-cryptosystem based trust delegation mechanism to generate a delegation pass code for mobile station authentication, and it can effectively defend all known attacks to mobile networks including the denial-of-service attack. Moreover, the mobile station only needs to receive one message and send one message to authenticate itself to a visitor’s location register, and the model only requires a single elliptic-curve scalar point multiplication on a mobile device. Therefore, this model enjoys both computation efficiency and communication efficiency as compared to known mobile authentication models.
