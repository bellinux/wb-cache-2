2500|$|In 1856, whilst {{trying to}} {{synthesise}} quinine, von Hofmann's student William Henry Perkin discovered mauveine {{and went into}} industry producing the first synthetic dye. [...] Other aniline dyes followed, such as <b>fuchsine,</b> safranine, and induline. [...] At the time of mauveine's discovery, aniline was expensive. [...] Soon thereafter, applying a method reported in 1854 by Antoine Béchamp,O3) – FeO is the [...] "protoxide" [...] from which protosalts can be made.

[...] Today, the name of BASF, originally Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabrik (English: Baden Aniline and Soda Factory), now among the largest chemical suppliers, echoes the legacy of the synthetic dye industry, built via aniline dyes and extended via the related azo dyes. [...] The first azo dye was aniline yellow.|$|E
50|$|Acid <b>fuchsine</b> {{may be used}} {{to stain}} collagen, smooth muscle, or mitochondria.Acid <b>fuchsine</b> is used as the nuclear and {{cytoplasm}}ic stain in Mallory's trichrome method. Acid <b>fuchsine</b> stains cytoplasm in some variants of Masson's trichrome. In Van Gieson's picro-fuchsine, acid <b>fuchsine</b> imparts its red colour to collagen fibres. Acid <b>fuchsine</b> is also a traditional stain for mitochondria (Altmann's method).|$|E
50|$|Basic <b>fuchsine</b> is {{a mixture}} of rosaniline, pararosaniline, new <b>fuchsine</b> and Magenta II. Formulations usable for making of Schiff reagent must have high content of pararosanilin.

[...] In 1915, M. Heidenhain introduced azocarmine G {{in place of the}} acid <b>fuchsine</b> of Mallory's method. Heidenhain also introduced visually controlled destaining to provide for different colours in cell nuclei (dark red), collagen (blue) and a variety of colours in cytoplasm.|$|E
50|$|The {{modified}} Russel-Movat staining highlights a lot {{of tissue}} components in histological slides. It is obtained by a mix of five stains: alcian blue, Verhoeff hematoxylin, crocein scarlet combined with acidic <b>fuchsine</b> and saffron. At pH 2.5, alcian blue is fixed by electrostatic binding with the acidic mucopolysaccharides. The Verhoeff hematoxylin has a high affinity for nuclei and elastin fibers, negatively charged. The combination of crocein scarlet with acidic <b>fuchsine</b> stains acidophilic tissue components in red. Then, collagen and reticulin fibers are unstained by a reaction with phosphotungstic acid and stained in yellow by saffron.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fuchsine</b> {{was first}} {{prepared}} by August Wilhelm von Hofmann from aniline and carbon tetrachloride in 1858. François-Emmanuel Verguin discovered the substance independently of Hofmann {{the same year}} and patented it. <b>Fuchsine</b> was named by its original manufacturer Renard frères et Franc, is usually cited with one of two etymologies: from {{the color of the}} flowers of the plant genus Fuchsia, named in honor of botanist Leonhart Fuchs, or as the German translation Fuchs of the French name Renard, which means fox. An 1861 article in Répertoire de Pharmacie said that the name was chosen for both reasons.|$|E
50|$|It becomes magenta when {{dissolved}} in water; as a solid, it forms dark green crystals. As well as dying textiles, <b>fuchsine</b> {{is used to}} stain bacteria and sometimes as a disinfectant. In the literature of biological stains {{the name of this}} dye is frequently misspelled, with omission of the terminal -e, which indicates an amine. American and English dictionaries (Webster's, Oxford, Chambers, etc.) give the correct spelling, which is also used in the literature of industrial dyeing. It is well established that production of <b>fuchsine</b> results in development of bladder cancers by production workers. Production of magenta is listed as a circumstance known to result in cancer.|$|E
50|$|After decolorization, the gram-positive cell remains {{purple and}} the gram-negative cell loses its purple color. Counterstain, {{which is usually}} {{positively}} charged safranin or basic <b>fuchsine,</b> is applied last to give decolorized gram-negative bacteria a pink or red color.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fuchsine</b> is an {{amine salt}} and has three amine groups, two primary amines and a {{secondary}} amine. If {{one of these}} is protonated to form ABCNH+, the positive charge is delocalized across the whole symmetrical molecule due to pi cloud electron movement.|$|E
