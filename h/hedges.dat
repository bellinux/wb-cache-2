5|$|In the {{traditional}} cottage garden, <b>hedges</b> served as fences {{on the perimeter}} to keep out marauding livestock and for privacy, along with other practical uses. Hawthorn leaves made a tasty snack or tea, while the flowers were used for making wine. The fast-growing Elderberry, in addition to creating a hedge, provided berries for food and wine, with the flowers being fried in batter or made into lotions and ointments. The wood had many uses, including toys, pegs, skewers, and fishing poles. Holly was another hedge plant, useful because it quickly spread and self-seeded. Privet was also a convenient and fast-growing hedge.

The constant conditional correlation (CCC) and dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) bivariate generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (BGARCH) specifications are employed to calculate the time-varying <b>hedge</b> ratios.

We take the perspective of a domestic firm that is exposed to foreign currencies (such as the GBP, CHF, and JPY) operating in a member country of the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC). Three important questions are involved in hedging: (i) to <b>hedge</b> or not; (ii) the choice of the <b>hedging</b> instrument; and (iii) measurement of the <b>hedge</b> ratio. Our results show that there is no difference in performance and risk under these three <b>hedging</b> strategies (always to <b>hedge,</b> to <b>hedge</b> or not to <b>hedge,</b> and always not to <b>hedge)</b> for all of the GCC currencies against foreign currencies. Our examination of the effectiveness of three financial <b>hedging</b> techniques&mdash;forward <b>hedging,</b> money-market <b>hedging</b> and cross-currency hedging&mdash;shows that it makes no difference whether we use forward <b>hedging</b> or money-market <b>hedging</b> (for all of the GCC currencies against foreign currencies). However, in relation to cross-currency <b>hedging,</b> the results are mixed. We find that the effectiveness of cross-currency <b>hedging</b> depends on the correlation between the exchange rates of the base currency against the exposure currency, and the currency used as the <b>hedging</b> instrument. In examining the effectiveness of financial <b>hedging</b> (such as forward <b>hedging)</b> versus operational <b>hedging,</b> (such as risk-sharing arrangements, currency collars, and hybrid arrangements) we find that forward <b>hedging</b> is more effective than either risk-sharing arrangements or hybrid arrangements. However, when compared with currency collars, the results are mixed. Finally, we find that the use of different econometric models to estimate the <b>hedge</b> ratio fails either to add value or improve the effectiveness of the <b>hedge.</b> This implies that {{there is no need for}} a sophisticated econometric model to estimate the <b>hedge</b> ratio, because what matters is correlation...|$|R
