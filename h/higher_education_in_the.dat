5|$|Collins {{followed}} up her {{success in the}} 1985 special session with a push for more higher education funding in the 1986 legislative session. Lawmakers obliged by approving an additional $100million for <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> biennial budget. They also approved implementation of a pilot preschool program and the purchase of new reading textbooks, but failed to act on Collins' request for an additional $3.9million to improve the state's vocational education system. Legislators approved calling a referendum on a constitutional amendment– supported by Collins– to make the state superintendent of education an appointive, rather than elective, office. The amendment was defeated by the state's voters in November 1986, despite a Collins-led campaign in favor of it. The increased corporate tax intended {{to cover the cost}} of the increased education budget was, however, inadequate. In 1987, a plan to increase revenue through changes in the state income tax was abandoned when Wallace Wilkinson, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee who would go on to succeed Collins, announced his opposition to it.|$|E
