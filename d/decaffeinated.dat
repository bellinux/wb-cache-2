By weight, dark chocolate has one to two times the amount of caffeine as coffee: 80–160mg per 100g.

50|$|The {{supercritical}} CO2 acts selectively on the caffeine, {{releasing the}} alkaloid and nothing else. Water-soaked coffee beans {{are placed in}} an extraction vessel. The extractor is then sealed and supercritical CO2 is forced into the coffee at pressures of 1,000 {{pounds per square inch}} (about 69 bar) to extract the caffeine. The CO2 acts as the solvent to dissolve and draw the caffeine from the coffee beans, leaving the larger-molecule flavor components behind. The caffeine-laden CO2 is then transferred to another container called the absorption chamber where the pressure is released and the CO2 returns to its gaseous state and evaporates, leaving the caffeine behind. The caffeine is removed from the CO2 using charcoal filters, and the caffeine free CO2 is pumped back into a pressurized container for reuse on another batch of beans. This process has the advantage that it avoids the use of potentially harmful substances. Because of its cost, this process is primarily used to <b>decaffeinate</b> large quantities of commercial-grade, less-exotic coffee found in grocery stores.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Coffee husk {{and coffee}} pulp are coffee {{processing}} by-products. Coffee husk is obtained when harvested coffee is processed by the dry method, and coffee pulp {{is produced by}} the wet method. In Brazil, coffee is usually processed by the dry method, therefore an expressive amount of husk is obtained every year. Some of the husk is used as organic fertilizer but, other applications are very limited, mainly {{because it is a}} bulky product. The presence of tannins and caffeine diminish acceptability and palatability of husk by animals. This review discuss degradation of caffeine by microorganisms, with special attention to bacterial, biological decaffeination of coffee husk and pulp and its subsequent use on animal feeding. The known biochemical routes of caffeine degradation by microorganisms are initially discussed; problems concerning physiological effects in animals, focusing on the limitations imposed by caffeine as an antiphysiological component are raised; the use of microorganisms to <b>decaffeinate</b> coffee husk and pulp is discussed. The discussions offer a view on decreasing caffeine content of coffee husk and pulp, which would allow the use of larger amounts of these products in animal feeding, partially replacing traditional components such as cereal grains...|$|R
40|$|Supercritical fluids {{have a great}} {{potential}} for wide fields of processes Although CO 2 {{is still one of}} the most used supercritical gases, for special purposes propane or even fluorinated-chlorinated fluids have also been tested. The specific characteristics of supercritical fluids behaviour were analyzed such as for example the solubilities of different components and the phase equilibria between the solute and solvent. The application at industrial scale (<b>decaffeinating</b> of tea and coffee, hop extraction or removal of pesticides from rice), activity in supercritical extraction producing total extract from the raw material or different fractions by using the fractionated separation of beverages (rum, cognac, whisky, wine, beer cider), of citrus oils and of lipids (fish oils, tall oil) were also discussed. The main interest is still for the extraction of natural raw materials producing food ingredients, nutraceuticals and phytopharmaceuticals but also cleaning purposes were tested such as the decontamination of soils the removal of residual solvents from pharmaceutical products, the extraction of flame retardants from electronic waste or precision degreasing and cleaning of mechanical and electronic parts. An increasing interest obviously exists for impregnation purposes based on supercritical fluids behaviour, as well as for the dying of fibres and textiles. The production of fine particles in the micron and submicron range, mainly for pharmaceutical products is another important application of supercritical fluids. Completely new products can be produced which is not possible under normal conditions. Supercritical fluid technology has always had to compete with the widespread opinion that these processes are very expensive due to very high investment costs in comparison with classical low-pressure equipment. Thus the opinion is that these processes should be restricted to high-added value products. A cost estimation for different plant sizes and different applications was also analyzed...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to explore the properties of supercritical carbon dioxide (CO 2). In addition, the feasibility of building a small-scale low cost system will be explained. A supercritical fluid is a fluid which exhibits properties between liquid and gas with liquid like densities and viscosities similar to a gas. Since the discovery of supercritical fluids in 1822, the use of supercritical fluids, specifically supercritical CO 2, has grown in popularity. The application of supercritical CO 2 has continued to grow in industrial applications since the 1970 ’s. Supercritical CO 2 ’s has many beneficial properties as a “green” solvent. Supercritical CO 2 as a solvent is able to be implemented {{in a wide range}} of applications from aerospace, microchip manufacturing, food production, biomedical, pharmaceutical, dry-cleaning, and many more. This thesis project included designing, building and testing a supercritical CO 2 extraction apparatus that examines the use of supercritical CO 2 as a solvent in the extraction process of <b>decaffeinating</b> coffee. Due to the fact that supercritical CO 2 requires high pressure operating conditions, the apparatus design is important not only for function but also for safety. In the description portion of this paper, design considerations related to each component’s function and their specific roles in the overall system are clearly stated. Furthermore, the build process is outlined along with the overall step-by-step operation of the apparatus. Different methods of data measurements are taken while the system is running, in order to interpret the apparatus’ overall functionality. Through the exploration of this experimental data, the results were compared between different operating parameters. In order to determine the feasibility of the supercritical apparatus, the devise was tested by applying the supercritical CO 2 as a solvent for the extraction of caffeine from coffee beans. Analysis of the analytical data recorded from experimental testing confirms that the apparatus produced supercritical CO 2. After testing specific operating conditions, it is proven that the supercritical CO 2 is able to function as a “green” solvent in this small-scale system. The experimental results from these analytical runs are compared with theoretical maximums in order to determine the efficiency of the devise. Lastly, the paper presents an overview including lessons learned from the design process and from the information gathered. Data from experimental testing is interpreted and the system design is reevaluated with suggestions for future improvements...|$|R
