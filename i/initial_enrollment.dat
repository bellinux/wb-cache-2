40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe the feasibility of using Facebook as a platform to recruit and retain young adult veteran drinkers into an online-alcohol use intervention study. Facebook's wide accessibility and popularity among the age group that comprises the majority of veterans from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan make it a compelling resource through which research can extend its reach to this otherwise hard-to-reach group. We developed a series of Facebook advertisement campaigns to reach veteran drinkers not specifically searching for alcohol treatment. In doing so, we recruited 793 valid veteran participants in approximately two weeks for an advertising cost of $ 4. 53 per obtained participant. The study sample consisted primarily of male veterans, between 19 and 34 years of age, who were drinking at moderate to heavy levels. Although about half of the sample reported mental health comorbidity, few had received any mental health or substance use treatment in the past year.

40|$|An {{important}} {{goal of the}} desegregation of schools following the Supreme Court's decision in Brown vs. Board of Education was {{to improve the quality}} of the schools black children attended. This paper uses a new dataset to examine the effects of desegregation on public and private enrollment and the system of school finance for Louisiana. I show that the system of school finance in Louisiana had long favored whites in high black enrollment share districts. Because of this system, whites in districts with high black enrollment shares stood to lose the most from desegregation, as the gap between white student-teacher ratios and black student-teacher ratios in those districts was higher. Given the importance of districts' black enrollment share in the system of finance and the potential impact of desegregation, I examine how changes in public and private enrollment, the local property tax base, and per-pupil revenue relate to the <b>initial</b> black <b>enrollment</b> share. The analysis suggests that the Jim-Crow system of school finance [...] which had prevailed for over 60 years [...] unraveled as the schools desegregated. While desegregation did induce some "white flight" and reduce the local property tax base slightly, the policies had the intended effect of reducing black-white gaps in school resources, as increased funding allowed districts to "level up" average spending in integrated schools to that previously experienced only in the white schools. ...|$|R

40|$|Although college {{enrollment}} {{rates have}} increased substantially {{over the last}} several decades, socioeconomic inequalities in college completion have actually widened over time. A critical question, therefore, is how to support low-income and first-generation students to succeed in college after they matriculate. We investigate the impact of the Dell Scholars Program which provides a combination of generous financial support and individualized advising to scholarship recipients before and throughout their postsecondary enrollment. The program's design is motivated by a theory of action that, in order to meaningfully increase the share of lower-income students who earn a college degree, it is necessary both to address financial constraints students face and to provide ongoing support for the academic, cultural and other challenges that students experience during their college careers. We isolate the unique impact of the program on college completion by capitalizing on an arbitrary cutoff in the program's algorithmic selection process. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that although being named a Dell Scholar has no impact on <b>initial</b> college <b>enrollment</b> or early college persistence, scholars at the margin of eligibility are significantly more likely to earn a bachelor's degree on-time or six years after high school graduation. These impacts are sizeable and represent a nearly 25 percent or greater increase in both four- and six-year bachelor's attainment. The program is resource intensive. Yet, back-of-theenvelope calculations indicate that the Dell Scholars Program has a positive rate of return...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Gastric intraepithelial {{neoplasia}} (IEN; formerly dysplasia) is {{an advanced}} precancerous lesion. Lesions indefinite for IEN mimic the IEN phenotype but lack some morphologic attributes of IEN. Indefinite for IEN lesions may arise in native foveolae (atypical foveolar hyperproliferation [aFH]) or intestinalized glands (hyperproliferative intestinal metaplasia [HIM]). The clinicopathologic outcome of such lesions is debated. We retrospectively studied the clinicopathologic behavior of 129 consecutive indefinite for IEN lesions (HIM, 98; aFH, 31; median follow-up, 31 months) and correlated outcome with {{the extent and}} topography of mucosal atrophy (assessed by OLGA staging) at the <b>initial</b> endoscopy/biopsy. At <b>enrollment,</b> aFH never coexisted with severe/extensive atrophy (all cases were in low-risk OLGA stages [0 -II]), whereas HIM was associated with low- and high-risk OLGA stages (0 -II, 73; III-IV, 25). At follow-up, IEN was never documented among cases enrolled as aFH, while follow-up endoscopy/biopsy documented 6 neoplastic intraepithelial lesions among 98 cases of HIM (6 %, all had high-risk OLGA stages at initial biopsy).

The final study population included 30, 765 non-Hispanic Black and non-Hispanic White nursing home residents who died between state fiscal years 2000 - 2002 in Florida. The behavioral model of health services use successfully predicted group membership in hospice use. In the full model, seven variables - female gender, non-Hispanic White race/ethnicity, being married, urban area of residence, and cancer and dementia/Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease as causes of death [...] predicted increased likelihood of hospice use. This study also found that race/ethnicity moderates the strength of the effect of the illness on the likelihood of using hospice. Among residents who died of cancer, no difference in hospice use was found between the two racial/ethnic groups while hospice utilization rate among non-cancer residents was lower for non-Hispanic Blacks than non-Hispanic Whites. The same predisposing, enabling and need factors tested in predicting hospice use were examined for association with the probability of survival time since hospice admission. The poor model fit and the small number of factors found to significantly affect the probability of survival time from the <b>initial</b> hospice <b>enrollment</b> suggest that the survival time might be influenced by external factors other than covariates examined in this study. This study found hospice to be a powerful predictor of place of death among nursing home residents.

The core recruited and retained study subjects, scheduled visits, obtained demographic and medical data, assessed oral health status, collected samples, and guided analysis of the hypotheses. This manuscript presents a well-designed clinical core that may serve as a model for studies that combine clinical and laboratory data. Crosstalk was a case-control longitudinal clinical study an <b>initial</b> planned <b>enrollment</b> of 170 subjects. HIV+ antiretroviral naïve subjects were followed for 9 visits over 96 weeks and HIV uninfected subjects for 3 visits over 24 weeks.

Cohorts of HIV+ and HIV- were demographically similar except for a larger proportion of women in the HIV- group. The most prevalent oral mucosal lesions were oral candidiasis and hairy leukoplakia in the HIV+ group. The clinical core was essential to enable the links between clinical and laboratory data.

The 'robust public option' which would have offered a modicum of competition to a monopolistic industry was whittled down from an <b>initial</b> potential <b>enrollment</b> of 129 million Americans to 6 million. An amendment which would have protected the rights of states to pursue single-payer health care was stripped from the bill {{at the request of}} the Administration....

[...] Unlike many, if not all, of his fellow democrats who voted against the bill, Kucinich has not been the target of scorn from liberal media outlets, but has instead been well received as being a man of conviction to his goal of a single-payer system. When the bill comes out of conference committee, Kucinich will have the opportunity to vote for final passage of the bill, or vote 'no' as he previously had.
