25|$|In a {{study of}} this gene among the <b>Hominoidea</b> two finding unique to humans emerged: (1) an excess of non-synonymous {{divergence}} among species {{that appears to be}} caused solely by accelerated evolution and (2) the ability of the single GYPC gene to encode both the GPC and GPD proteins. The cause for this is not known but it was suggested that these findings might be the result of infection by Plasmodium falciparum.|$|E
25|$|Biologists {{classify}} humans, {{along with}} only a few other species, as great apes (species in the family Hominidae). The living Hominidae include two distinct species of chimpanzee (the bonobo, Pan paniscus, and the common chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes), two species of gorilla (the western gorilla, Gorilla gorilla, and the eastern gorilla, Gorilla graueri), and two species of orangutan (the Bornean orangutan, Pongo pygmaeus, and the Sumatran orangutan, Pongo abelii). The great apes with the family Hylobatidae of gibbons form the superfamily <b>Hominoidea</b> of apes.|$|E
25|$|Hepatitis B is {{a disease}} caused by {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) which infects the liver of <b>hominoidea,</b> including humans, and causes an inflammation called hepatitis. The disease has caused epidemics in parts of Asia and Africa, and it is endemic in China. About {{a third of the}} world's population, more than 2 billion people, have been infected with HBV. Transmission of HBV results from exposure to infectious blood or body fluids containing blood. Possible forms of transmission include (but are not limited to) unprotected sexual contact, blood transfusions, re-use of contaminated needles and syringes, and vertical transmission from mother to child during childbirth. HBV can also be transmitted between family members within households, possibly by contact of non-intact skin or mucous membrane with secretions or saliva containing the virus. However, at least 30% of reported hepatitis B cases among adults cannot be associated with an identifiable risk factor.|$|E
2500|$|There {{is little}} fossil {{evidence}} for the divergence of the gorilla, chimpanzee and hominin lineages. The earliest fossils that have been proposed {{as members of the}} hominin lineage are Sahelanthropus tchadensis dating from , Orrorin tugenensis dating from , and Ardipithecus kadabba dating to [...] Each of these species has been argued to be a bipedal ancestor of later hominins, but all such claims are contested. It is also possible that any one of the three is an ancestor of another branch of African apes, or is an ancestor shared between hominins and other African <b>Hominoidea</b> (apes). The question of the relation between these early fossil species and the hominin lineage is still to be resolved. From these early species the australopithecines arose around [...] diverged into robust (also called Paranthropus) and gracile branches, possibly one of which (such as A. garhi, dating to [...] ) is a direct ancestor of the genus Homo.|$|E
2500|$|Plesiopithecus teras {{was first}} {{described}} in 1992 by paleoanthropologist Elwyn L. Simons. [...] The holotype, which {{was found at}} the base of the Jebel Qatrani Formation at the Egyptian Fayum in quarry L-41 and dated to the latest Eocene, included a right mandible with intact dentition ranging from the third molar up to the first anterior tooth. [...] Simons acknowledged that the taxonomic interpretation was complicated, though he initially decided to classify under superfamily <b>Hominoidea</b> (apes) due to its flat and broad lower molars. [...] Its bizarre and specialized traits made it difficult to classify until the discovery of its skull, reported in 1994, showed it had a postorbital bar, proving that it was a strepsirrhine primate.

5000|$|Modern {{biologists}} and primatologists use monophyletic groups for taxonomic classification; that is, they use only those groups that include all descendants {{of a common}} ancestor. The superfamily <b>Hominoidea</b> is such a group—also known as a clade. Some scientists now use the term [...] "ape" [...] to mean {{all members of the}} superfamily <b>Hominoidea,</b> including humans. For example, in his 2005 book, Benton wrote [...] "The apes, <b>Hominoidea,</b> today include the gibbons and orang-utan ... the gorilla and chimpanzee ... and humans". Modern {{biologists and}} primatologists refer to apes that are not human as [...] "non-human" [...] apes.

5000|$|Some, or - {{recently}} - all, hominoids {{are also}} called [...] "apes", but {{the term is}} used broadly and has several different senses within both popular and scientific settings. [...] "Ape" [...] {{has been used as}} a synonym for [...] "monkey" [...] or for naming any primate with a human-like appearance, particularly those without a tail.

50|$|Parapithecidae is an extinct {{family of}} {{primates}} which {{lived in the}} Eocene and Oligocene periods in Egypt. Eocene fossils from Burma are sometimes included in the family in addition.

5000|$|Proconsul nyanzae is {{a species}} of fossil primate first {{discovered}} by Louis Leakey on Rusinga Island in 1942, which he published in Nature in 1943. A joint publication of Wilfrid Le Gros Clark and Louis Leakey in 1951, [...] "The Miocene <b>Hominoidea</b> of East Africa", first defines Proconsul nyanzae.

50|$|In 1977, {{researcher}} J. Michael Bedford {{discovered that}} human sperm could penetrate the protective outer membranes of a gibbon egg. Bedford's paper {{also stated that}} human spermatozoa would not even attach to the zona surface of non-hominoid primates (baboon, rhesus monkey, and squirrel monkey), concluding that although the specificity of human spermatozoa {{is not confined to}} man alone, it is probably restricted to the <b>Hominoidea.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{other major}} clade within Haplorhini, the simians (or anthropoids), {{is divided into}} two parvorders: Platyrrhini (the New World monkeys) and Catarrhini (the Old World monkeys and apes). The New World monkeys split from catarrhines about 40 mya, while the apes (<b>Hominoidea)</b> diverged from Old World monkeys (Cercopithecoidea) about 25 mya. The {{available}} fossil evidence indicates that both the hominoid and cercopithecoid clades originated in Africa.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{superfamily}} <b>hominoidea</b> or apes, {{configurations of}} {{the muscles of the}} posterior compartment of the forearm share similar characteristics. However, the anconeus is usually not present in the hylobates (gibbons). [...] Also, the extensor pollicis brevis is only present in the genus homo (humans) and the genus hylobates because the extensor pollicis brevis and the abductor pollicis longus exist as a single muscle in other genera.|$|E
5000|$|The {{superfamily}} <b>Hominoidea</b> {{falls within}} the parvorder Catarrhini, which also includes the Old World monkeys of Africa and Eurasia. Within this grouping, the two families Hylobatidae and Hominidae can be distinguished from Old World monkeys {{by the number of}} cusps on their molars; hominoids have five in the [...] "Y-5" [...] molar pattern, whereas Old World monkeys have only four in a bilophodont pattern.|$|E
50|$|Another {{problem with}} {{potential}} hominid cryptids in South America {{is that of}} the distinct biogeographical distribution of primate species. Hominids (<b>Hominoidea)</b> are restricted to the Old World (except humans, of course), while the New World is populated by smaller, often arboreal monkeys with long tails and flatter noses (Platyrrhini). Consequently, there is little evolutionary and biogeographical reason to expect a hominid primate hiding in the jungles of South America (Sjögren, 1980).|$|E
5000|$|Within the <b>Hominoidea</b> (apes) superfamily, the Hominidae family diverged {{from the}} Hylobatidae (gibbon) family some 15-20 million years ago; African great apes (subfamily Homininae) diverged from orangutans (Ponginae) about the Hominini tribe (humans, Australopithecines and other extinct biped genera, and chimpanzee) parted from the Gorillini tribe (gorillas) between [...] and and, in turn, the subtribes Hominina (humans and biped ancestors) and Panina (chimps) {{separated}} about [...] to [...]|$|E

50|$|The discoverers {{described}} Anoiapithecus brevirostris as a hominoid (superfamily <b>Hominoidea)</b> in the Dryopithecine tribe. They {{believe that}} it has more modern traits than the Kenyapithecines from which Kenyapithecus wickeri from Kenya brings fragmentary information. The African specimens are considered a sister taxon to the hominids, and 2 million year younger European specimens must be from after the time that these two groups split. This means that hominids may have evolved in Europe.|$|E
50|$|Apes (<b>Hominoidea)</b> are {{a branch}} of Old World {{tailless}} anthropoid primates native to Africa and Southeast Asia. They are the sister group of the Old World monkeys, together forming the catarrhine clade. They are distinguished from other primates by a wider degree of freedom of motion at the shoulder joint as evolved by the influence of brachiation. There are two extant branches of the superfamily Hominoidea: the gibbons, or lesser apes; and the hominids, or great apes.|$|E
50|$|Biologists {{classify}} humans, {{along with}} only a few other species, as great apes (species in the family Hominidae). The living Hominidae include two distinct species of chimpanzee (the bonobo, Pan paniscus, and the common chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes), two species of gorilla (the western gorilla, Gorilla gorilla, and the eastern gorilla, Gorilla graueri), and two species of orangutan (the Bornean orangutan, Pongo pygmaeus, and the Sumatran orangutan, Pongo abelii). The great apes with the family Hylobatidae of gibbons form the superfamily <b>Hominoidea</b> of apes.|$|E
50|$|Epipliopithecus had a tail, and {{although}} this trait {{is shared by}} some crown catarrhines (Old World Monkeys), it excludes pliopithecoids from <b>Hominoidea.</b> Moreover, Epipliopithecus has an extremely primitive elbow with enteepicondylar foramen. This morphology {{does not allow for}} the arm to be fully extended as in suspensory hominoids like chimpanzees, organutans, or gibbons. Combined with a hinge-like thumb joint, similar to the condition seen in New World monkeys, these traits suggest that Epipliopithecus was a quadruped who moved atop tree branches similar to small and medium-sized monkeys.|$|E
50|$|For {{their part}} specifically, Australia, North America and South America, which {{respectively}} {{had the highest}} incremental extinction rates, had no known native species of <b>Hominoidea</b> (apes) at all, much less species of Hominidae (greater apes), and especially not native species of the Homo subgroup (the genus Homo comprises the species Homo sapiens, which includes modern humans, {{as well as several}} extinct species classified as ancestral to or closely related to modern humans; all indigenous human groups are ultimately descendants of anatomically modern humans recently migrated out of Africa in anthropological time scale).|$|E
5000|$|Below is a {{cladogram}} {{with some}} of the extinct monkey species. Generally, extinct non-hominoid simian species, including early Catarrhine species are discussed as monkeys as well as simians or anthropoidea, which cladistically means that <b>Hominoidea</b> are monkeys as well, restoring monkeys as a single grouping. It is indicated approximately how many million years ago (Mya) the clades diverged into newer clades. It is thought the New World monkeys started as drifted [...] "Old World monkey" [...] group from the old world (probably Aftrica) to the new world (South America).|$|E
5000|$|The apes - in both {{traditional}} and phylogenic nomenclature - are exclusively catarrhine species. In traditional usage, ape describes any tailless, larger, and more typically ground-dwelling species of catarrhine. [...] "Ape" [...] may be found {{as part of the}} common name of such species, such as the Barbary ape. In phylogenic usage, the term ape applies only to the superfamily <b>Hominoidea.</b> This grouping comprises the two families Hylobatidae, the lesser apes or gibbons, and Hominidae, the great apes, including orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, Homo, and related extinct genera, such as the prehuman australopithecines and the giant orangutan relative Gigantopithecus.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{there had}} been earlier studies, the {{scientific}} investigation of behaviour and cognition in non-human members of the superfamily <b>Hominoidea</b> expanded enormously during {{the latter half of}} the twentieth century. Major studies of behaviour in the field were completed on the three better-known [...] "great apes", for example by Jane Goodall, Dian Fossey and Birute Galdikas. These studies have shown that in their natural environments, the non-human hominoids show sharply varying social structure: gibbons are monogamous, territorial pair-bonders, orangutans are solitary, gorillas live in small troops with a single adult male leader, while chimpanzees live in larger troops with bonobos exhibiting promiscuous sexual behaviour. Their diets also vary; gorillas are foliovores, while the others are all primarily frugivores, although the common chimpanzee does some hunting for meat. Foraging behaviour is correspondingly variable.|$|E
