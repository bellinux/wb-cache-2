2500|$|Fisher {{also had}} a close {{relationship}} with singer James Blunt. While working on his album Back to Bedlam in 2003, Blunt spent much of his time at Fisher's residence. When Vanity Fair's George Wayne asked Fisher if their relationship was sexual, she replied: [...] "Absolutely not, but I did become his therapist. He was a soldier. This boy has seen awful stuff. Every time James hears fireworks or anything like that, his heart beats faster, and he gets 'fight or flight.' You know, he comes {{from a long line of}} soldiers dating back to the 10th century. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> these horrible stories. He was a captain, a reconnaissance soldier. I became James' therapist. So it would have been unethical to sleep with my patient." ...|$|E
2500|$|Garbo never married, had no children, {{and lived}} alone as an adult. Her most famous romance {{was with her}} {{frequent}} co-star, John Gilbert, with whom she lived intermittently in 1926 and 1927. Soon after their romance began, Gilbert began helping her acting on the set, teaching her how to behave like a star, how to socialize at parties, and {{how to deal with}} studio bosses. They costarred again in three more hits, Love (1927), A Woman of Affairs (1928), and Queen Christina (1933). Gilbert allegedly proposed to her numerous times, with Garbo agreeing but backing out at the last minute. [...] "I was in love with him," [...] she said. [...] "But I froze. I was afraid <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what to do and boss me. I always wanted to be the boss." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{followed}} {{me to see}} whether I was going to question Corp. You were afraid <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what really happened. You {{wanted to see him}} first to tell him what to say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Another hobby," [...] Hamel replied. [...] "He is an inventor, it seems. He has {{the model}} of {{something}} there; <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! that {{explains}} it," [...] Nellie said. [...] "He {{had been talking}} to father, and I asked what it was about and <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> and I have been very angry with him ever since." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed. Fancy his {{not being}} {{fit to be}} trusted to look after them! However, I tell him it is of no consequence. I don't know how they went. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> the story until you came down." ...|$|R
60|$|Then I {{know not}} what I said to him, save {{the end of}} it was that I {{supposed}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> next that I could fill a hall with darkness at noonday and cover a multitude with terror.|$|E
60|$|This letter {{undoubtedly}} {{referred to}} my inheritance, and I wondered how large a sum it was, and why Uncle Felix {{did not dare}} {{to use it for}} his own benefit, seeing that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> nothing concerning it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{following}} the Englishman, Pelham, all day," [...] she said in German. [...] "He has seen Miss Poynton. I have talked with him since at a caf√©, but <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> nothing. He has evidently been warned." ...|$|E
6000|$|I thought <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be a {{good person}} to learn {{interesting}} things from, so I asked him if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> mind <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> something about the whale fishing in the old days. He was just settling himself to begin when the clock struck six, whereupon he laboured to get up, and said, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} be drawn into a {{conversation}} with Mr. Bullding," [...] she declared. [...] "I believe that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> bore <b>me.</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>me,</b> what are these bananas and nuts for?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{knows it}} already. When I had cleared {{it all up}} I had an {{interview}} with him, and finding that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> the story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite clear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his lips." ...|$|R
60|$|As far as I remember, I {{have never}} met Mr. Carnegie. But I know that if I did <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that he found it quite {{impossible}} {{to keep up with}} Mr. Rockefeller. No doubt Mr. Rockefeller has the same feeling.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{great thing}} to do, sir," [...] <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> on every occasion, when I {{gave him the}} chance, [...] "the great thing {{is to get the}} ship past 8 d 20' of latitude. Once she's past that we're all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Listen,' she said, 'and try to understand. If I {{thought she}} hated him, I {{would tell her}} something. If she thought you hated them, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> something. If ye or you thought he hated her, I would tell him something. I will wait and see.' ...|$|E
60|$|I slept {{far into}} the next day. Herky was in camp alone. The others had gone, Herky said, and <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> where. <b>He</b> did not appear as cheerful as usual. I {{suspected}} he had quarreled with his companions, very likely about {{what was to be}} done with me. The day passed, and again I slept. Herky awakened me before it was light.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] {{answered}} Japhet, [...] "and I do {{not think}} that my friend knew either, or, if <b>he</b> did, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b> But I understand the plot is that the Child of Kings is to be carried off to the Prince Joshua's castle {{at the other end of}} the lake, six hours' ride away, and there be forced to marry him at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have a spite {{against him}} for the {{information}} he gave me on the score of how and by whom I was nursed. So have I. Because he did not <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> before, and because when he told <b>me</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> enough. <b>He</b> has no eyes, this Leduc. He is a dolt, who only sees the half of what happens, and only remembers the half {{of what he has}} seen." ...|$|R
60|$|Our {{conversation}} at that first encounter would do {{very little to}} develop the Modern Utopia in my mind. Inevitably, it would be personal and emotional. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> how he stood in his world, and I how I stood in mine. I should {{have to tell him}} things, I should have to explain things----.|$|E
60|$|The {{same night}} I {{hit on a}} way of {{clearing}} up such doubts as still harassed my mind. I wrote to the rector of Roth, informing him that I was engaged to marry her, and asking if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> (in consideration of my position) what her former relations might have been with the person named John Zebedee.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} do it. Think of Lucy, and how she stands with him. Besides, I have already had words with Lufton about Sowerby and his money matters. He thinks that I am to blame, and <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> so; and {{then there would be}} sharp things said between us. He would advance me the money if I pressed for it, but he would do so {{in a way that would}} make it {{impossible}} that I should take it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not want}} to hear of it," [...] he said, leaping to his feet. [...] "If there was {{anything}} my father wanted <b>me</b> to know <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> it to <b>me</b> at once. You do not suppose I want to hear it from anyone else?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I said to {{the more}} {{powerful}} of the two sorcerers--"What would happen if one of your spirits had overpowered me?" [...] "You would go out of this room," [...] he answered, [...] "with his character added to your own." [...] I asked {{about the origin of}} his sorcery, but got little of importance, except that he had learned it from his father. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> not <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> more, for he had, it appeared, taken a vow of secrecy.|$|R
6000|$|... "'That {{you may get}} away, {{or perhaps}} that you may conceal what you have stolen,' said I. And then, {{realising}} the dreadful position in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation. He might avert it all if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> but <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what <b>he</b> had done with the three missing stones.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{told him}} briefly {{that it was}} impossible. The nature of his wound was such that it was clearly {{the work of an}} assassin. In a certain sense we were the upholders of the law on the island, and I pointed this out to him sternly. He only shook his head and closed his eyes. Neither then nor at any other time could I gain from him one single word as to his doings on that night. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The head {{man said}} that was so; and <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what I wanted to do: I {{wanted to go to}} the Company's General Offices in Milk Street, and tell them about it. That was where {{everything}} went as a last resort, and he would bet any money that I would see my picture there the first thing I got inside the door. I thanked him with the fervor I thought he merited, and said I would go at once.|$|E
6000|$|... "Something {{is wrong}} somewhere," [...] she sighed. [...] "There {{must be some}} snarl that even Gran'pa Jim can't untangle; and, if he can't, I'm sure no one else can. I wish I could find him and that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> all about it. I suppose he thinks I'm too young to confide in, but I'm almost sixteen now and surely that's old enough to {{understand}} things. There were girls at school twenty years old that I'm sure couldn't reason as well as I can." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2013 CNN {{segment on}} {{the origins of}} Festivus, O'Keefe spoke about the real-life {{experiences}} related to the holiday. O'Keefe's father, who originated some of the now-recognized Festivus traditions, used a clock, not an aluminum pole. O'Keefe told CNN: [...] "The real symbol of the holiday was a clock that my dad put in a bag and nailed to the wall every year...I don't know why, I don't know what it means, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> never <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> <b>would</b> always say, 'That's not for you to know.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, he did," [...] {{said the}} Story Girl triumphantly. [...] "I met {{him one day}} last week back in the maple woods when I was looking for ferns. He was sitting by the spring, writing in his brown book. He hid it {{when he saw me}} and looked real silly; but after I had talked to him awhile I just asked him about it, and told him that the gossips said he wrote poetry in it, and if <b>he</b> did <b>would</b> <b>he</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> because I was dying to know. He said he wrote a little of {{everything}} in it; and then I begged him to read me something out of it, and he read me the story of Ursula and Kenneth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet," [...] thought Kenyon, [...] "the poor fellow bears himself like a hero, too! If <b>he</b> <b>would</b> only <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> his trouble, or give me {{an opening}} to speak frankly about it, I might help him; but he finds it too horrible to be uttered, and fancies himself the only mortal that ever felt the anguish of remorse. Yes; he {{believes}} that nobody ever endured his agony before; so that--sharp enough in itself--it has all the additional zest of a torture just invented to plague him individually." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes!" [...] she answered. [...] "I {{have lived}} {{a very quiet}} life, Capitaine Rotherby. After the Sisters had {{finished}} with me--and I stayed at the school longer {{than any of the}} others--I went straight to the house of a friend of my uncle's, where I had only a dame de compagnie. My uncle--he was so long coming, and the life was very dull. But always he wrote to me, 'Some day I will take you to London!' Even when we were in Paris together <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{must come}} down," [...] said the Marquis, getting {{up from his}} chair. [...] "It shall come down. Do you think that I would allow it to stand when it has been erected on his ground,--through my error? Not for a day!--not for an hour! I'll tell you what, Mr. Boothby,--that man has known it all through;--has known {{it as well as}} you do now; but he has waited till the {{building}} was complete before <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b> I see it all as plain as the nose on your face, Mr. Boothby." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‚ÄúI {{called at}} Mr. Secretary the other day, {{to see what}} the d‚Äî‚Äî ailed [...] him on Sunday: I made him a very proper speech; told him I {{observed}} [...] he was much out of temper, that I did not expect <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> [...] the cause, but would be glad to see he was in better; and one thing [...] I warned him of‚Äînever to appear cold to me, for I would not be [...] treated like a schoolboy; that I had felt too much of that in my [...] life already‚Äù [meaning Sir William Temple] &c. &c.‚ÄîJournal to [...] Stella.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Dear, dear me,' I kept on saying {{under my}} breath, 'he {{is doing it}} all wrong. A downright unmitigated villain would never go on like that; <b>he</b> <b>would</b> do so and so, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> look like this, and speak like that, and act like the other. I know <b>he</b> <b>would.</b> My {{instinct}} <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> so.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Off-court issues {{cut short}} both Halbrook's college and {{professional}} careers. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> reportedly go missing for days, sometimes {{weeks at a}} time without explanation. [...] Oregon State coach Gill was forced to cut him from the team after only two seasons for skipping class so often. Nationals coach Hannum is quoted to have said that [...] "He could have had a worthwhile career if he had taken care of himself. During his second season, he disappeared for a week and we sent the police out to look for him. But they couldn‚Äôt find a 7-footer! He came back on his own but <b>he</b> never <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> where <b>he</b> had been." ...|$|R
60|$|She said I hadn't time to talk, {{and that}} she <b>would</b> write and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> everything. Dick also said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> write and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> everything; and that if I felt moved to send them down a hamper--the sort of thing that, left to themselves, Fortnum & Mason would put {{together}} for a good-class picnic, say, for six persons--I might rely upon it that nothing would be wasted.|$|R
