50|$|Three Drugs, Sintamil, Varsyl, Satranidazole; several patents; about 270 publications; one antiamoebic in {{clinical}} trials in India and also exported.He discovered an important new lead for Anti TB activity. He {{was involved in the}} development and commercialisation of several drugs like azathioprine and pesticides like <b>flucythrinate</b> and quinalphos. He is experienced in custom synthesis, contract research.|$|E
40|$|A {{model for}} the {{repellent}} effect of pyrethroid insecticides on insects was developed. Experiments were conducted using a small colony of honey bees in a flight cage. Conditioning to scented feeders allowed the separation of foraging bees from a single colony into treatment and control groups. Permethrin, cypermethrin, fenvalerate and <b>flucythrinate</b> were shown to be contact repellents to honey bees; exposure was primarily to the tarsi and ventral abdomen. The threshold dose of permethrin required to induce repellency was ca. 3. 8 ng/bee. Repellency was fully reversible within 24 hours. No permanent effects on either memory or foraging efficiency were observed following acute exposure...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic {{pyrethroids}} are neurotoxic insecticides {{with a low}} mammalian toxicity. Prior {{investigations have}} found these agents to be neither cutaneous irritants nor sensitisers. Clinically demonstrable inflammation, as judged by erythema, oedema, or vesiculation, has not been apparent. Nevertheless, paraesthesia does result from cutaneous exposure. In this investigation technical grade <b>flucythrinate</b> {{was applied to the}} forearms of human participants twice daily for five consecutive days. Laser Doppler velocimeter measurements were made before each topical application, with histamine phosphate being intradermally injected on termination of the study. Results of both laser Doppler velocimetry and histamine induced axon reflex vasodilatation were not statistically significant at an alpha = 0. 05 level. This investigation suggests that the synthetic pyrethroids have little influence on neurogenic vasodilatation on topical exposure...|$|E
40|$|Honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) {{were exposed}} to six {{pyrethroid}} insecticides using four application techniques. Toxicities of the insecticides were compared. Results of topical and contact tests placed the six pyrethroids {{in one of three}} categories based on their relative toxicity to honey bees; highly toxic (cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, and permethrin), moderately toxic (<b>flucythrinate</b> and fenvalerate), and non-toxic (fluvalinate). The residue tests, by contrast, simulated field conditions by using sprayed cotton leaves for exposure. This test showed that both compound and formulation {{played an important role in}} determining toxicity. The conditioning test combined some of the previously used techniques and refined them into a test for detecting behavioral changes to bees following sublethal exposure to pesticides. Insecticide-treated honey bees had a lower learning curve than their respective control group. This indicates that, although bees may survive poisoning from pesticides, certain physiological functions are affected...|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} growing {{concerns}} {{about the effects of}} food safety standards on agricultural trade throughout the world. The objective {{of this paper is to}} assess the impacts of food safety standards on tea exports from China, the world's largest tea producer and exporter. To achieve this objective, the paper discusses the trends and nature of China's tea production and export, analyzes changes on tea safety standards indicated by Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) measures, Maximum Residual Limit (MRL) of pesticides and the coverage of tea safety standards concerning regulatory pesticides in major importing countries, and quantitatively estimates the impacts of food safety standards on China's tea export based on a gravity model. The results show that the MRL of pesticides (e. g., endosulfan, fenvalerate and <b>flucythrinate)</b> imposed by importing countries have significantly affected China's tea exports. The results also show that China's tea exports have been significantly restricted when importing countries increase coverage of tea safety standards concerning regulatory pesticides.
