Multiple regression analysis was utilized to examine the combined effect of principal 2 ̆ 7 s <b>emotional</b> intelligence <b>quotient</b> and school culture on student achievement. The study population consisted of secondary school principals and teachers within Virginia Department of Education 2 ̆ 7 s Region VII. Quantitative data were collected using two survey instruments and publicly available standardized test pass percentage data: Emotional Intelligence Appraisal (see Appendix A for sample questions) by TalentSmart (Bradberry 2 ̆ 6 Greaves, 2010); the School Culture Survey (see Appendix B) developed by Gruenert (1998); and The Commonwealth of Virginia 2 ̆ 7 s Standards of Learning (SOL) test data.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the relation-ship between the <b>emotional</b> {{intelligence}} <b>quotient</b> and health-related quality of life using structural equation modeling. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted among 1, 911 mothers who visited the Health Center for an infant medical examination. A hypothetical model was constructed us-ing variables of the <b>emotional</b> intelligence <b>quotient,</b> social support, coping, parenting stress, and perceived health competence. Result: There were a total of 1, 104 valid responses (57. 8 %). Sig-nificant standardized estimates were obtained, confirming the good-ness of fit issues with the model. The emotional intelligence quo-tient had a strong impact on physical and psychological quality of life, and showed the greatest association with coping. This study differed from previous studies in that, due to the inclusion of social support and explanatory variables in coping, an increase in coping strategies was more highly associated with <b>emotional</b> intelligence <b>quotient</b> levels than with social support. Conclusion: An enhanced <b>emotional</b> intelligence <b>quotient</b> should be considered a primary objective to promote the health of mothers with infant children.

J. D. Considine from The Baltimore Sun commented, [...] "I've seen the Springsteen stadium tour, I've seen Dylan and the [...] Dead, and I was at Live Aid. Out of all those shows, Madonna's {{is the only one}} I want to see again. You need a larger-than-life show if you want to come off in a stadium, and Madonna does. She's not that large physically, but she holds your attention." [...] Ann Ayers, assistant entertainment editor of USA Today felt that the show was high on glitz and low on <b>emotional</b> <b>quotient.</b> [...] "Madonna's going for a certain kind of show: a Broadway, show-biz, song-and-dance spectacle. In that context it's hard to make a connection with the audience, and I'd have to say that she didn't." [...] Peter Goddard from Toronto Star reviewed the concert in CNE Stadium and said, [...] "Madonna proved that she may be a lost girl in the roads of life, like her film, but she ain't lost when she is singing. Especially during songs like 'Papa Don't Preach', her vocal prowess was substantially notable." [...] Scott A Zamost and Elizabeth Snead, writing for Chicago Tribune, felt that [...] "For the most part, the premiere concert on Madonna's Who's That Girl tour was a success, an extravaganza of multiple videos, flashing lights and precision dancing. If the high-tech accoutrements and inferior sound system made it difficult to hear the singer, one hopes that will be refined as the tour continues across the United States. [...] As a dancer, Madonna is supreme on stage. Her trademark skip to a funky beat highlighted the constant acrobatics. One minute she was stage left, another minute stage right. She ran up a wide staircase center stage to party with her three back-up singers, then scooted down to the stage floor, swinging her hips, accompanied by other dancers." ...|$|E
