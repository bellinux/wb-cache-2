5|$|Congress is not {{prevented}} from legislating as to tribes generally; and {{this appears to}} be what it has done in successive versions of the Nonintercourse Act. There <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the Act to suggest that ‘tribe’ is to be read to exclude a bona fide tribe not otherwise federally recognized. Nor, as the district court found, is there evidence of congressional intent or legislative history squaring with appellants' interpretation. Rather we find an inclusive reading consonant with the policy and purpose of the Act.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no reason}} why the writ of error should be {{confined}} to civil cases. A man's life, his liberty, and his good name, are as dear to him as his property; and inferior courts are as liable to err in one case as in the other. There <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the nature of the cases which should make a difference; nor is it a novel doctrine that a writ of error should lie in a criminal case. They have been frequent in that country from which we have drawn almost all our forms of judicial proceedings.|$|E
5|$|There are {{different}} {{opinions on the}} significance of these principles. Some note that the osteopathic medical philosophy is akin to the tenets of holistic medicine, suggestive of a kind of social movement within the field of medicine, one that promotes a more patient-centered, holistic approach to medicine, and emphasizes the role of the primary care physician within the health care system. Others point out that there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the principles that would distinguish D.O. from M.D. training in any fundamental way. One study, published in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association found a majority of M.D. medical school administrators and faculty saw nothing objectionable in the core principles listed above, and some endorse them generally as broad medical principles.|$|E

25|$|According {{to another}} scholar, the mufti of Egypt, Dr. Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy, there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the Quran or Hadith that prohibits the pre-fixing {{of the rate}} of return, {{as long as it}} occurs with the mutual consent of the parties.|$|E

25|$|If Eric succeeded Blót-Sweyn {{he would}} have been the {{contemporary}} of Inge the Elder, and this suggests that Eric could have been the last high priest (goði) of the Temple at Uppsala, and that he was killed or deposed by Inge the Elder.

25|$|Washington biographer Rupert Hughes {{determined}} that Rev. Gano served with Clinton's army, not with Washington's, that the location is sometimes given as Valley Forge and sometimes as the Potomac, {{that there is}} no documentation of Gano ever being at Valley Forge, that there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> Gano's own correspondence or his biography to suggest that the event took place, and that none of the 42 reputed witnesses ever documented the event.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} these documents, there are no written {{accounts}} of the Guadalupe vision by Catholic clergymen of the 16th century, as there {{ought to have been}} if the event had the importance it is claimed to have had. In particular, the canonical account of the vision features archbishop Juan de Zumárraga as {{a major player in the}} story, but, although Zumárraga was a prolific writer, there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> his extant writings that can confirm the story.|$|E

25|$|Fred Donner {{has argued}} {{for an early}} date for the {{collection}} of the Quran, based on his reading of the text itself. He points out that if the Quran had been collected over the tumultuous early centuries of Islam, with their vast conquests and expansion and bloody incidents between rivals for the caliphate, there would have been some evidence of this history in the text. However, there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the Quran that does not reflect what is known of the earliest Muslim community.|$|E
25|$|Relying on this clause, the Supreme Court {{has held}} that where the marshal {{of a state}} court {{received}} state bank notes in payment and discharge of an execution, the creditor was entitled to demand payment in gold or silver. Since, however, there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the Constitution prohibiting a bank depositor from consenting when he draws a check that payment may be made by draft, a state law providing that checks drawn on local banks should, {{at the option of}} the bank, be payable in exchange drafts was held valid.|$|E
25|$|Rüstow and Köchly, {{writing in}} the 19th century, {{believed}} that Pelopidas led the Sacred Band out from the column to attack the Spartans in the flank. Hans Delbrück considered {{this to be a}} mere misreading of Plutarch. Plutarch does indeed describe Pelopidas leading the Band and catching the Spartans in disorder, but there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> his account that conveys anything other than the Sacred Band being the head of the column, and the Spartans were disordered not because they were taken in the flank but because they were caught in mid-maneuver, extending their line.|$|E

25|$|Muslims {{believe that}} Gabriel brought {{the word of}} God to Muhammad verbatim, without any {{alteration}} or change. The Quran emphasizes that Muhammad was required only to receive the sacred text {{and that he had}} no authority to change it (10.15). It is also believed that God did not make himself known through the revelations; it was his will that was revealed. There <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the Quran that suggests that Muhammad saw God during his revelations. For Muhammad, the revelations were real and he believed the context was objective, but he was only able to describe the experience through metaphorical terms.|$|E
25|$|Kléber {{emerged as}} {{undoubtedly}} {{one of the}} greatest generals of the French revolutionary epoch. Though he distrusted his powers and declined the responsibility of supreme command, there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> his career to show that he would have been unequal to it. As a second-in-command no general of his time excelled him. His conduct of affairs in Egypt, {{at a time when the}} treasury was empty and the troops were discontented for want of pay, shows that his powers as an administrator were little – if at all – inferior to those he possessed as a general.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} White's style it is {{important}} note that while he spent almost {{all of his life}} from 1906 to 1925 living in New York City, there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> his photographs to indicate he ever lived there. There were no streets scenes or people in the city, no buildings, bridges, ships or automobiles. Unlike most of his photographer friends, he chose to ignore the very place he lived except for the access it gave him to promote his work and to teach others. Although he was pragmatic in his need to earn a living and advance his art, he remained true to his small town roots throughout his life.|$|E

25|$|His exact date {{of birth}} is not known, but he was baptised on 16 July 1820 as Christopher Green to William and Mary Green at Upwell, close to Wisbech and the Isle of Ely in the Fenlands of the Norfolk/Cambridgeshire borders. There <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> later records to {{disagree}} with 1820 being his year of birth. His 1874 obituary writer, styling himself as 'The Sportsman', tells of him learning to ride {{at a very early}} age 'whipped in to his father' who hunted a pack of harriers across the 'enormous Fen drains'. He soon earned a name for the daring manner in which he rode.|$|E
25|$|Yermolai Alexeievitch Lopakhin – a merchant. Lopakhin {{is by far}} {{the wealthiest}} {{character}} in the play, but comes from the lowest social class. This contrast defines his character: he enjoys living the high life, {{but at the same time}} is uncomfortably conscious of his low beginnings and obsession with business. He is often portrayed on stage as an unpleasant character because of his greedy tendencies and ultimate betrayal of the Gayev family, but there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the play to suggest this: he works strenuously to help the Gayevs, but to no avail. Lopakhin represents the new middle class in Russia, one of many threats to the old aristocratic way of doing things.|$|E
25|$|Bush {{was paid}} for {{drilling}} on April 7–8, 1973. That service presumably occurred at his home base, Ellington Air Force Base, in Houston, in contradiction to the information in his performance review. For May 1973, Bush {{was paid for}} service on fifteen days: 1–3, 8–11, 19–20, 22–24, and 29-31. For June, he was paid for five days; for July (his last month of drilling) for 19 days. However there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> the released military documents that shows that he actually reported for duty on those days, or exactly where, or what duties he performed. As {{of the end of}} July 1973, Bush had been in the National Guard for a little over five years.|$|E
