5|$|Modern scholarship, {{noting the}} way in which similar {{accounts}} were associated in ancient times with the deaths of notable figures, sees the phenomenon as a literary invention that attempts to convey a sense of the power of Jesus in the face of <b>death,</b> <b>or</b> a sign of God's displeasure with the Jewish people. Scholars have also noted the ways in which this episode appears to draw on earlier biblical accounts of darkness from the Old Testament.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance formed on August 11 and gradually organized. The next day, an atmospheric circulation developed.

It became a depression on August 16, turned {{a little bit more}} westward, and dissipated on August 17. Hilary never came near land, and as such caused no <b>death</b> <b>or</b> damage.|$|E

5|$|After {{a series}} of civil wars, Ladislaus's main focus was the {{restoration}} of public safety. He introduced severe legislation, punishing those who violated property rights with <b>death</b> <b>or</b> mutilation.

Ladislaus's victories over the Pechenegs and Cumans ensured the security of his kingdom's eastern borders for about 150 years. His relationship with the Holy See deteriorated during the last years of his reign, as the popes claimed that Croatia was their fief, but Ladislaus denied their claims.|$|E
