5|$|The 20th {{anniversary of}} Achtung Baby {{was marked by}} several {{releases}} in 2011. At the band's request, a documentary film about the album entitled <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sky</b> Down was produced. It was directed by Davis Guggenheim, who previously collaborated with the Edge for the documentary It Might Get Loud in 2008. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sky</b> Down documents the album's difficult recording period, the band members' relationships, and U2's creative process. Archival footage and stills from the recording sessions appear in the film, along with unreleased scenes from Rattle and Hum. For the documentary, the band were filmed during a return visit to Hansa Studios and during rehearsals for the Glastonbury Festival 2011. The film premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival, and in October, it was broadcast on multiple television networks worldwide.|$|E
5|$|A fierce sky {{caught in}} the {{dichotomy}} between the setting sun and the crescent moon dominates {{more than a third}} of the painting. The rain-heavy clouds swirling ominously around each celestial entity are separated by a gulf of calmness, intensifying the contrast and infusing the heavens with an unearthly glow. Light <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> spills onto the landscape: while the western continent and the Nile are bathed in the sun's light, the east and the Tower of Babel are cloaked in shadow.|$|E
5|$|For the CGI {{compositions}} of the Vale of Arryn, {{as seen in}} the {{establishing shot}} of the Eyrie and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> cells, the visual effects team used images and textures from the Greek rock formations of Meteora. Initially they had been considering the Zhangjiajie Mountains in China, but because the landscape base plates were being shot in Ireland, using Meteora was a better option.|$|E

5|$|Hurley {{confesses to}} Libby {{that he has}} an eating disorder, and shows her a stash of Dharma food. Hurley expresses {{interest}} in getting rid of it, and she encourages him to do so. Just after Hurley destroys his supplies, other survivors go into the jungle. Following them, Hurley and Libby see that an enormous package of food parachuted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> After Hurley panics {{at the suggestion of}} again being in charge of the supplies, he sees Dave, and tries to follow him as he goes into the jungle.|$|E
5|$|In Parhelion Peak, the game's snow zone, Sonic and Tails {{notice a}} feather float down <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> They board another of Eggman's {{airships}} and complete another zone, whereupon they find another feather. They trace the feathers to Eggman's bird-like robot, which is guarding the Emeralds. Sonic retrieves the Emeralds and uses {{them to become}} Super Sonic. He fights the robot as the game's final boss. After its defeat, Sonic and Tails fly aboard the Tornado once more—the segue into the events of Sonic the Hedgehog 3.|$|E
5|$|In late 2011, Shadows Fall {{entered the}} studio to begin {{recording}} their seventh studio album.

5|$|Leonardo {{received}} an informal education in Latin, geometry and mathematics. In later life, Leonardo recorded only two childhood incidents. One, which he {{regarded as an}} omen, was when a kite dropped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> and hovered over his cradle, its tail feathers brushing his face. The second occurred while he was exploring in the mountains: he discovered a cave and was both terrified that some great monster might lurk there and driven by curiosity {{to find out what}} was inside.|$|E
5|$|Lightning is an {{electrical}} discharge {{that occurs in}} a thunderstorm. It {{can be seen in}} the form of a bright streak (or bolt) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> Lightning occurs when {{an electrical}} charge is built up within a cloud, due to static electricity generated by supercooled water droplets colliding with ice crystals near the freezing level. When a large enough charge is built up, a large discharge will occur and can be seen as lightning.|$|E

5|$|Morpheus– The God of Dreams and {{the silent}} {{ally of the}} goddess Persephone in Chains of Olympus. After Helios was taken <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> by Atlas, which plunged the world into darkness, Morpheus forced both gods and mortals to slumber as his black fog covered the lands. An unseen character, Morpheus was thwarted when Kratos killed Persephone, imprisoned the Titan Atlas, and {{returned}} Helios to the sky. Morpheus did not appear in any other game, leaving his fate unknown.|$|E
5|$|Seasons {{begins as}} the Triforce {{calls out to}} Link from within Hyrule Castle. Link {{approaches}} it, and is transported to a dark forest where he encounters a traveling group led by a dancer named Din. After Din welcomes Link to Holodrum, the sky becomes covered in black clouds. A voice from the clouds calls Din the Oracle of Seasons and refers to himself as Onox, General of Darkness. A funnel cloud drops <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> taking Din into its dark heights. As the tornado dissipates, the seasons of Holodrum fall into disarray and change rapidly.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} animal can {{integrate}} cues of different types to orient themselves and navigate effectively. Insects and birds are able to combine learned landmarks with sensed direction (from the earth's magnetic field or <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky)</b> to identify {{where they are and}} so to navigate. Internal 'maps' are often formed using vision, but other senses including olfaction and echolocation may also be used.|$|E

5|$|The spongy {{bones of}} the woodpecker's skull and the {{flexibility}} of its beak, both of which provide protection for the brain when drumming, have provided inspiration to engineers; a black box needs to survive intact when a plane falls <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> and modelling the black box with regard to a woodpecker's anatomy has increased the resistance of this device to damage sixty-fold. The design of protective helmets is another field being influenced by the study of woodpeckers.|$|E
5|$|Atlantic puffins are {{probably}} safest when out at sea. Here, the dangers are often from below the water rather than above, and puffins {{can sometimes be}} seen putting their heads underwater to peer around for predators. Seals {{have been known to}} kill puffins and large fish may also do so. Most puffin colonies are on small islands, and this is no coincidence as it avoids predation by ground-based mammals such as foxes, rats, stoats and weasels, cats and dogs. When they come ashore, the birds are still at risk and the main threats come <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bart goes to {{the video}} game store and coerces the clerk to let him buy the new and violent Grand Theft Scratchy game, only to have it confiscated by Marge. While Bart mopes, a video game manual crashes down <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> in front of him. Reading through the manual, Bart discovers {{that he and the}} rest of his family have special powers. Later, Bart uses his Bartman powers to stop Jimbo, Kearney, and Dolph from {{stealing}} from the Natural History Museum, Homer uses his ability to become a huge ball and win an eating contest, Lisa uses her powers of meditation to stop a deforestation project, and Marge uses her powers to influence crowds to stop the release of Grand Theft Scratchy in Springfield, although Lisa points out it is ironic she used violence to stop a violent game.|$|E

5|$|Between 4:45 and 5:00 pm, {{a number}} of people in the area of Winona, Minnesota, were observing a {{thunderstorm}} approaching from the northwest. These people told the Civil Aeronautics Board that the storm was increasing in intensity, and they observed increasing amounts of thunder and lightning. The aircraft continued on course in the direction of Winona, where it encountered the thunderstorm. The aircraft was seen flying below the clouds before entering the roll cloud, or leading edge of the thunderstorm. This was the last reported sighting of the aircraft; seconds later, local observers saw pieces of the aircraft falling <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b>|$|E
5|$|Captain Nikos– Featured in the God of War comics #2, #3, and #4, Captain Nikos was a Spartan who Kratos met {{after he}} had slain the Hades Phoenix. Captain Nikos and his men {{assisted}} Kratos in his search for the Ambrosia of Asclepius. Nikos was injured in battle against Poseidon's champion Herodius, but survived. Hades later sent fireballs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> to stop the Spartan army. As a fireball was about to strike Kratos, Nikos sacrificed himself to save him. Before dying, he passed the rank of Captain to Kratos. During Kratos' second journey, Nikos' corpse, {{and those of other}} Spartans, were reanimated by Hades, but Kratos easily defeated them.|$|E
5|$|In past Zelda titles, {{the team}} had made {{numerous}} new fields for player exploration, but this time they limited the number of overworlds to three and expanded their content so players {{would be able to}} full appreciate them through repeated visits. The team also created the world based on their experiences with Twilight Princess: feeling that the overworld and dungeons were too large with puzzles too thinly dispersed, the team both sought to compact areas and have environmental puzzles in the overworld. The biggest difficulty was ensuring that players could reach areas quickly while still discovering new features and puzzles. The creation of the Skyloft overworld was due to difficulties connecting the three Surface-based overworlds with each other due to drastically contrasting environments. The sky was initially going to be presented similar to the course selection screen from the Super Mario series, but this was changed to an overworld with its own quests and population so Link had a place where he could prepare for his adventures. An initial idea, when jumping down <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> seemed unlikely to be approved, was to have a huge tower acting as a central hub, with the height at which Link jumped lengthening the duration of his free fall. Once the concept of traveling <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> had been chosen instead, the Loftwing mounts were created so it looked and felt more rational to players. These overlapping gameplay mechanics triggered the creation of Skyloft, along with elements of the early game such as the Knight Academy. The continual movements and routines of Skyloft's people were modeled after similar time-driven mechanics from , with similar links between character-specific side quests and the main narrative. Despite the aerial element, the mechanics necessary for free navigation meant a Loftwing racing minigame could not be implemented.|$|E
