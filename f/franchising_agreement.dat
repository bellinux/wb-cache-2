5|$|As {{a result}} of Burger King's actions, Hungry Jack's owner Jack Cowin and his private holding company Competitive Foods Australia began legal {{proceedings}} in 2001 against Burger King's parent Burger King Corporation with a counter-claim {{that the company had}} violated the conditions of the master <b>franchising</b> <b>agreement</b> and was in breach of the contract. In a decision handed down by the Supreme Court of New South Wales that affirmed Cowin's claims, Burger King was determined to have violated the terms of the contract and as a result was required to pay Cowin and Hungry Jack's a $46.9million (Aus, $41.6million USD 2001) award. The court's decision {{was one of the first}} major cases in Australia that implied that the American legal concept of good faith negotiations existed with the framework of the Australian legal system, which until that verdict, had rarely been seen in the country's courts. In its decision, the Court stated that Burger King had failed to act in good faith during contract negotiations by seeking to include standards and clauses that would engineer a default of the franchise agreement, allowing the company to limit the number of new Hungry Jack’s branded restaurants and ultimately claim the Australian market as its own, a purpose that was extraneous to the agreement.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This study {{explores the}} {{termination}} of <b>franchise</b> <b>agreement</b> in Jordan. The study discusses the grounds to terminate the <b>franchise</b> <b>agreement</b> by each party whether franchiser or franchisee. Regulating the franchise sector by a specific act minimizes unfair termination and helps strengthen the franchise sector in Jordan. Design/methodology/approach: This study is qualitative. Eleven in-depth semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} the relevant parties involved in <b>franchise</b> <b>agreements</b> as well as legislatures. The analysis was thematically conducted and accordingly supported by sufficient excerpts. Findings: The study found several grounds to terminate the <b>franchise</b> <b>agreement</b> by the parties involved. Emphatically, the participants were unanimous regarding the breach of the contract terms and conditions as the main ground to terminate the <b>franchise</b> <b>agreement.</b> Research limitations: The research participants were franchisors, franchisees and parliamentarians in Jordan. Additionally, the data collection constrained by funds paucity and difficulties in securing appointments with the participants who were always busy and not available. Two of the participant answered the interview questions by filling up the questions instead of face to face and recorded interview. Practical implications: The study suggests that the termination grounds of the <b>franchise</b> <b>agreement</b> need to be more specific and limited to certain provisions which should be provided by specific act for this purpose. Otherwise the unfair termination whether by the franchisers or franchisees will continue. Originality/value: Even though <b>franchise</b> <b>agreement</b> literature s are aplenty, this study, however, is the first attempt at qualitatively exploring in-depth regarding the termination grounds for the <b>franchise</b> <b>agreement</b> in Jordan.
