5|$|Archaea were {{initially}} classified as bacteria, receiving the name archaebacteria (in the Archaebacteria kingdom), but this classification is outdated. Archaeal cells have unique properties separating {{them from the}} other two domains of life, Bacteria and Eukaryota. The Archaea are further divided into multiple recognized phyla. Classification <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>because</b> the majority have not been isolated in the laboratory and have only been detected by analysis of their nucleic acids in samples from their environment.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the nearest}} Sun-like stars, Epsilon Eridani has {{been the target of}} many {{attempts}} to search for planetary companions. Its chromospheric activity and variability mean that finding planets with the radial velocity method <b>is</b> <b>difficult,</b> <b>because</b> the stellar activity may create signals that mimic the presence of planets. Attempts at direct imaging of potential exoplanets have proven unsuccessful to date.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that Michael Jackson earned about $750 million in his lifetime. Sales of his recordings through Sony's music unit earned him an estimated $300 million in royalties. He may have also earned an additional $400 million from concerts, music publishing (including {{his share of the}} Beatles catalog), endorsements, merchandising and music videos. Estimating how much of these earnings Jackson was able to personally pocket <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>because</b> one has to account for taxes, recording costs and production costs.|$|E

5|$|Service design {{management}} differs {{in several ways}} from product {{design management}}. For example, the application of international trading strategies of services <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>because</b> the evolution of service 'from a craftsmanship attitude to industrialization of services' requires {{the development of new}} tools, approaches, and policies. Whereas goods can be manufactured centrally and delivered around the globe, services have to be performed at the place of consumption, which makes it difficult to achieve global quality consistency and effective cost control.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of the G-spot is typically reported as being about 50 to 80mm (2 to 3in) inside the vagina, on the front wall. For some women, stimulating this area creates a more intense orgasm than clitoral stimulation. The G-spot area {{has been described as}} needing direct stimulation, such as two fingers pressed deeply into it. Attempting to stimulate the area through sexual penetration, especially in the missionary position, <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>because</b> of the particular angle of penetration required.|$|E
5|$|Titan {{is never}} {{visible to the}} naked eye, but can be {{observed}} through small telescopes or strong binoculars. Amateur observation <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>because</b> of the proximity of Titan to Saturn's brilliant globe and ring system; an occulting bar, covering part of the eyepiece and used to block the bright planet, greatly improves viewing. Titan has a maximum apparent magnitude of +8.2, and mean opposition magnitude 8.4. This compares to +4.6 for the similarly sized Ganymede, in the Jovian system.|$|E

5|$|Amending the UN Charter, {{possibly}} {{through a}} Charter Review Conference under Article 109 of the UN Charter, is a commonly cited possibility. This <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>because</b> it requires ratification by two-thirds of UN members, including all five {{permanent members of}} the Security Council. There have been only five amendments to the UN Charter since 1945, and none of them were done through the Article 109 process. Louis Sohn and Grenville Clark, in their 1958 book World Peace Through World Law, proposed establishing a UN Parliamentary Assembly through this method.|$|E
5|$|The {{biggest problem}} {{faced by the}} MAUD Committee {{was to find a}} way to {{separate}} the 0.7% of uranium-235 from the 99.3% of uranium-238. This <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>because</b> the two types of uranium are chemically identical. Separation (uranium enrichment) would have to be achieved at a large scale. At Cambridge, Eric Rideal and his team investigated using a gas centrifuge. Frisch chose to perform gaseous thermal diffusion using Clusius tubes because it seemed the simplest method. Frisch's calculations showed there would need to be 100,000 Clusius tubes to extract the desired separation amount. Peierls turned to Franz Simon, who preferred to find a method more suitable for mass production.|$|E
5|$|Adults outnumber juveniles in most populations, but gauging the ratios <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>because</b> juveniles {{are harder}} to catch; with current {{sampling}} methods, estimates of age distribution vary widely. Annual survival rate of painted turtles increases with age. The probability of a painted turtle surviving from the egg to its first birthday is only 19%. For females, the annual survival rate rises to 45% for juveniles and 95% for adults. The male survival rates follow a similar pattern, but are lower overall than females, creating an average male age {{lower than that of}} the female. Natural disasters can confound age distributions. For instance, a hurricane can destroy many nests in a region, resulting in fewer hatchlings the next year. Age distributions may also be skewed by migrations of adults.|$|E

5|$|Classification of Cryolophosaurus <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>because</b> {{it has a}} mix of {{primitive}} and advanced characteristics. The femur has traits of early theropods, while the skull resembles much later species of the clade Tetanurae, like China's Sinraptor and Yangchuanosaurus. This led Paul Sereno et al. (1994) to place Cryolophosaurus in the taxon Allosauridae. Originally, Hammer and colleagues suspected that Cryolophosaurus might be a ceratosaur or even an early abelisaur, with some traits convergent with those of more advanced tetanurans, but ultimately concluded that it was itself the earliest known member of the tetanuran group. While a subsequent study by Hammer (along with Smith and Currie) again recovered Cryolophosaurus as a tetanuran, a later (2007) study by the same authors {{found that it was}} more closely related to Dilophosaurus and Dracovenator. Sterling Nesbitt et al. (2009), using the characters of Tawa found Cryolophosaurus to be a neither dilophosaurid nor averostran neotheropod but instead the sister group of a clade composed of dilophosaurids and averostrans. However, in 2012, Matthew Carrano found that Cryolophosaurus was a tetanuran, related to Sinosaurus, but unrelated to Dilophosaurus.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, formal futures markets {{appeared}} in the Dutch Republic during the 17th century. Among the most notable centered on the tulip market, {{at the height of}} Tulipmania. At the peak of tulip mania, in February 1637, some single tulip bulbs sold for more than 10 times the annual income of a skilled craftsworker. Research <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>because</b> of the limited economic data from the 1630s—much of which come from biased and very speculative sources. Some modern economists have proposed rational explanations, rather than a speculative mania, for the rise and fall in prices. For example, other flowers, such as the hyacinth, also had high initial prices {{at the time of their}} introduction, which immediately fell. The high asset prices may also have been driven by expectations of a parliamentary decree that contracts could be voided for a small cost—thus lowering the risk to buyers.|$|E
5|$|In {{evolutionary}} terms, {{the split}} between the Caelifera and the Ensifera is no more recent than the Permo-Triassic boundary; the earliest insects that are certainly Caeliferans are in the extinct families Locustopseidae and Locustavidae from the early Triassic, roughly 250 million years ago. The group diversified during the Triassic and have remained important plant-eaters from that time to now. The first modern families such as the Eumastacidae, Tetrigidae and Tridactylidae appeared in the Cretaceous, though some insects that might belong to the last two of these groups {{are found in the}} early Jurassic. Morphological classification <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>because</b> many taxa have converged towards a common habitat type; recent taxonomists have concentrated on the internal genitalia, especially those of the male. This information is not available from fossil specimens, and the palaentological taxonomy is founded principally on the venation of the hindwings.|$|E

5|$|Philosophy of {{chemistry}} is the philosophical {{study of the}} methodology {{and content of the}} science {{of chemistry}}. It is explored by philosophers, chemists, and philosopher-chemist teams. It includes research on general philosophy of science issues as applied to chemistry. For example, can all chemical phenomena be explained by quantum mechanics or is it not possible to reduce chemistry to physics? For another example, chemists have discussed the philosophy of how theories are confirmed in the context of confirming reaction mechanisms. Determining reaction mechanisms <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>because</b> they cannot be observed directly. Chemists can use a number of indirect measures as evidence to rule out certain mechanisms, but they are often unsure if the remaining mechanism is correct because there are many other possible mechanisms that they have not tested or even thought of. Philosophers have also sought to clarify the meaning of chemical concepts which do not refer to specific physical entities, such as chemical bonds.|$|E
5|$|The adult jaguar is an apex predator, {{meaning it}} exists {{at the top}} of its food chain and is not preyed on in the wild. The jaguar has also been termed a {{keystone}} species, as it is assumed, through controlling the population levels of prey such as herbivorous and granivorous mammals, apex felids maintain the structural integrity of forest systems. However, accurately determining what effect species like the jaguar have on ecosystems <b>is</b> <b>difficult,</b> <b>because</b> data must be compared from regions where the species is absent as well as its current habitats, while controlling for the effects of human activity. It is accepted that mid-sized prey species undergo population increases {{in the absence of the}} keystone predators, and this has been hypothesized to have cascading negative effects. However, field work has shown this may be natural variability and the population increases may not be sustained. Thus, the keystone predator hypothesis is not accepted by all scientists.|$|E
5|$|The rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia, {{which the}} Sumatran rhino inhabits, are also targets for {{legal and illegal}} logging because of the {{desirability}} of their hardwoods. Rare woods such as merbau, meranti and semaram are valuable on the international markets, fetching as much as $1,800perm3 ($1,375percuyd). Enforcement of illegal-logging laws <b>is</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>because</b> humans live within or near {{many of the same}} forests as the rhino. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake has been used to justify new logging. Although the hardwoods in the rainforests of the Sumatran rhino are destined for international markets and not widely used in domestic construction, the number of logging permits for these woods has increased dramatically because of the tsunami. However, while this species has been suggested to be highly sensitive to habitat disturbance, apparently it is of little importance compared to hunting, as it can withstand more or less any forest condition.|$|E
