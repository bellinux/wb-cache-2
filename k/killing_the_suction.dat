40|$|<b>The</b> <b>suction</b> nozzle of {{a vacuum}} cleaner was {{modified}} to enhance the power performance and to reduce the airf low-induced acoustic noise. <b>The</b> <b>suction</b> power efficiencies of the vacuum cleaner were measured for various nozzles: (1) original nozzle, (2) original nozzle with modified trench height, (3) original nozzle with modified connecting chamber, and (4) a combination of (2) and (3).

40|$|Background: Myringotomy with {{ventilation}} tube insertion is {{the most}} frequently used sur-gical procedure performed on children to treat otitis media with effusion. The risk of acoustic trauma caused by <b>the</b> <b>suctioning</b> noise during <b>the</b> procedure has not been clearly understood. The objective {{of this study was to}} investi-gate whether <b>the</b> <b>suctioning</b> noise during ventilation tube placement proce-dure damaged children's hearing. Methods: The study was conducted in a prospective manner. The ventilation tube placement procedures were performed on a series of 30 consecutive patients (60 ears). The electro-acoustic signals of <b>the</b> <b>suctioning</b> noises during <b>the</b> procedure were analyzed using a high quality digital tape recording system. The hearing threshold was measured using pure tone audiometry before and after the procedures. Results: The peak intensity of <b>the</b> <b>suctioning</b> noise ranged from 4 kHz to 10 kHz in frequency.

Conclusions: Even though the peak intensity of <b>the</b> <b>suctioning</b> noise may reach a level of more than 90 dB, it is not likely that <b>the</b> <b>suctioning</b> noise during <b>the</b> ventila-tion tube placement procedure causes noise-induced sensori-neural hearing loss...|$|R
40|$|Suction {{pressure}} pulsations created when <b>the</b> <b>suction</b> valve opens {{are caused by}} unsteady mass flow through the valve exciting acoustic resonances in <b>the</b> <b>suction</b> plenum.

This paper will show the importance of including the cylinder bore volume in the flow path analysis in order to accurately calculate pressure pulsations. Pressure pulsations will be calculated using Finite Element Method (FEM) calculated impedance transfer matrix method in a quasi-static solution. The method models the impedance of <b>the</b> <b>suction</b> plenum flow path including cylinder bore volume using a static geometry condition just after <b>the</b> <b>suction</b> valve opens. <b>The</b> interaction between <b>the</b> <b>suction</b> plenum, suction valve port geometry, and cylinder bore volume influence acoustic resonances in this system.
