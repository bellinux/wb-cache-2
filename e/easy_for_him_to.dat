5|$|According to {{writer and}} film {{director}} Jukka Virtanen, Vainio usually wrote his lyrics {{at the same}} time as the music. This is evident in the song Vanhojapoikia viiksekkäitä, written as a waltz and whose lyrics feature an aged bachelor who never got to dance at his own wedding. Virtanen has said that while Vainio worked at a fast pace, songs were never <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> write. His work did not become easier when he quit drinking, but it did become more emotional.|$|E
5|$|More than 60 Catsuits were {{designed}} in the six-month shoot at $1,000 each. The Batsuit was updated, which was made out of a thinner, slightly more flexible foam rubber material than the suit from Batman. DeVito was uncomfortable with his costume, but this made it <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> get into character. J. P. Morgan's wardrobe was used for inspiration on Max Shreck's costume design.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Stafford {{said there}} were good and bad points to working closely with Weston. His {{knowledge}} of her made it <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> arrange her music, but sometimes it caused difficulties. Weston knew Stafford's abilities and would write or arrange elaborate music because {{he knew she was}} capable of performing it. She also said she did not believe she could perform in Broadway musicals because she thought her voice was not powerful enough for stage work. In 2003, she recalled that there was often limited rehearsal time before she recorded a song, and how Weston would sometimes slip musical arrangements under the bathroom door as she was in the bath {{getting ready to go to}} the studio.|$|E

5|$|In an {{interview}} with the San Francisco Chronicle, Damon revealed that he was asked to appear on the show by Sean Hayes, a friend of Damon's and the actor that plays Jack on Will & Grace. Damon enjoyed the idea for the episode and agreed to appear on the show. He commented that it was <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> get into character because he had previously played a gay character in the film The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999). Following his appearance, Damon told the Chicago Sun-Times in June 2002 {{that he would like to}} come back and guest star.|$|E
5|$|Shay {{was found}} dead in a Kansas City hotel room on December 1, 1927. He was found with a gunshot wound to the head. Police {{officials}} initially said that the manner of death could have been either suicide or murder. Shay stayed in his room on the day that he died. A porter went to check on him that evening and found him on the floor with a pistol a few inches from his right hand. When physicians examined Shay's body, they found that a bullet had entered the right ear and exited the back of the head. Shay had lost the use of his right arm and hand after a stroke. Police said that if Shay were holding the gun in his left hand, {{it would not have been}} <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> shoot himself in the right side of the head.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the Bonaparte {{family had}} been bitter enemies of Russia. Nevertheless, the Tsar granted his {{permission}} for the marriage on condition that his daughter did not leave Russia to live abroad.

25|$|King Amadeus {{made him}} prince of Vergara. The Restoration caused a statue {{to him to}} be built near {{the gate of the}} Retiro Park in Madrid. A {{magnificent}} statue and fountain was raised in his memory at Logrono. Spaniards of all political factions, except Carlists and Ultramontanes, paid homage to his memory when he died at his La Rioja on 8 January 1879. His preferences were modest, his manners rather reserved but always kind and considerate of humble folk. He was a typical Spanish soldier-politician but had more of the better traits of the soldier born and bred than of the arts of the statesman. His military traits did not always make it <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> accommodate himself to courtiers and professional politicians.|$|E
25|$|Wei Yan's {{reasoning}} for his Ziwu Valley Plan {{was recorded}} in the historical text Weilüe, which was then added as annotations to his biography in the Sanguozhi. It stated: Wei Yan received intelligence that the defender of the strategic city Chang'an, Xiahou Mao, was cowardly and incompetent. Thus, he reasoned, it would be <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> take 5,000 troops (and another 5,000 to carry supplies) across the Qin Mountains via the Ziwu Valley (子午谷) and into Chang'an. Wei Yan estimated that he would reach Chang'an in ten days and scare Xiahou Mao into flight, leaving the grain in Chang'an's storehouses for Shu's taking. There, Wei Yan's force can wait for Zhuge Liang's main army to take the safer road out of Xie Valley (斜谷) and rendezvous in Chang'an. In this way, the region west of Xianyang could be conquered in one movement.|$|E
500|$|Barney Gumble is {{voiced by}} Dan Castellaneta. Early on the show, Castellaneta {{discovered}} {{that it was not}} <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do Barney's trademark belch every time a script called for it, so he identified his best belch and told the producers to make that the standard. Castellaneta has voiced Barney every time he has appeared in the series, {{with the exception of the}} episode [...] "Homer's Barbershop Quartet", in which some of Barney's singing is provided by a member of The Dapper Dans, who recorded lines for all four members of the Be Sharps. Their recordings were intermixed with the cast's, often with a cast member singing the melody and the Dapper Dans providing backup.|$|E

500|$|Harrison {{confessed that}} it was not <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> come up with the lyrics to [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] in that length of time. But two hours later, he had written the verses, and the hook, in spite of being hung over. Harrison had also made {{provision}} for a backing track; he played all the instruments on the track. The bridge was written by Beyoncé, who was inspired by looking at herself in the mirror; as she was not wearing matching clothes and her hair was untidy, she kept saying, [...] "I'm looking so crazy right now." [...] Harrison sang back to her and said, [...] "That's the hook." [...] It also inspired the title of the song. After that Beyoncé had filled up the middle eight, she came up with the catchphrase – [...] "Uh-oh, uh-oh, you know" [...] – alongside Harrison.|$|E
500|$|A reclusive gifted {{musician}} and writer, Daniel changed his surname from Pinter to Brand, the maiden {{name of his}} maternal grandmother, before Pinter and Fraser became romantically involved; while according to Fraser, his father couldn't understand it, {{she says that she}} could: [...] "Pinter is such a distinctive name that he must have got tired of being asked, 'Any relation? [...] Michael Billington wrote that Pinter saw Daniel's name change as [...] "a largely pragmatic move on Daniel's part designed to keep the press... at bay." [...] Fraser told Billington that Daniel [...] "was very nice to me {{at a time when it}} would have been only too <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> have turned on me... simply because he had been the sole focus of his father's love and now manifestly wasn't." [...] Still unreconciled at the time of his father's death, Daniel Brand did not attend Pinter's funeral.|$|E
500|$|Gaiman {{suggested}} they make an episode which centres on the TARDIS itself, {{which was not}} done before for the entire series since it began in 1963. The original plan focused {{on the idea of}} the Doctor being pursued by an enemy inside the TARDIS, but went through several subsequent changes; Gaiman changed the plan to focus on the companion due to the Doctor's knowledge of his ship making it too <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> escape his enemy, made the TARDIS the threat rather than just a specific alien to avoid making it a simple 'cat-and-mouse' game, and then included the idea of Idris to account for what happened to the TARDIS's mind during this attack. The central idea was a [...] "what if" [...] scenario {{to see what would happen}} if the Doctor and the TARDIS got to talk together. Head writer Steven Moffat liked the idea of featuring the TARDIS as a woman, believing this to be the [...] "ultimate love story" [...] for the Doctor.|$|E
50|$|Abdallahi {{said that}} it would be <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> {{accomplish}} things as president because his supporters would constitute a parliamentary majority.

500|$|When Monkey Punch began Lupin III, he {{was already}} working on another series, Pinky Punky. Monkey Punch enjoys writing outlaw characters, and both Lupin III and Pinky Punky made use of outlaws as central characters. According to him, this made it <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> write two series without much pressure. Monkey Punch enjoys puzzles and mysteries such as Columbo and Agatha Christie novels, and was also {{inspired}} by The Three Musketeers and the movies of Alfred Hitchcock. He believes the characters of Lupin and Fujiko {{are similar to the}} characters of D'Artagnan and Milady de Winter, and describes them as [...] "Not necessarily lovers, not necessarily husband and wife, but more just having fun as man and woman with each other". Another influence on the manga was Mad magazine. Monkey Punch said the appeal of drawing Lupin comes from the character being able to go anywhere without obstacles and being able to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants. However, this is contrasted by the appeal of Zenigata's strict personality. Originally the series was only expected to last three months, but due to its popularity, Monkey Punch continued to draw it. However, despite his happiness at its success, he has expressed confusion over its popularity.|$|E
500|$|In 1968, Jarrell and {{his wife}} opened WJ Studio and Gallery, below their home and studio. The space not only showcased the couple's work and that of other artists but went on to display the talents of Chicago poets and musicians. Jarrell's love for blues and jazz music made it <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> access the city's talent and his {{involvement}} with OCAC provided him with contacts in the poetry world. Artists such as Muhal Richard Abrams, John Stubblefield, Henry Threadgill, Anthony Braxton and the Chicago Art Ensemble would perform at the space. The gallery {{also served as a}} gathering place for the likes of Jeff Donaldson, Barbara Jones-Hogu, Gerald Williams and others, who would come to discuss concepts of a relevant black art aesthetic. The group struggled: Jarrell described the search as an attempt to find [...] "a collective concept that would say 'black art' at a glance." [...] Eventually, the group made a breakthrough while listing principles and ideas regarding the concept of black art; the term [...] "coolade colors" [...] was contributed by a fabric designer. The term covered the bright fashion of stylish African American men of the time, which Jarrell described as [...] "loud lime, pimp yellows, hot pinks, high-key color clothing." [...] The final concept for their aesthetic search would be message oriented art, revolving around socially aware content. African design would be included and meaningfulness for black people would be a necessity. This group's formation would be considered one of the best aligned and organized collectives in the Black Arts Movement. This group went on to form COBRA.|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} Sahara, Bodley spent {{three months in}} Java working on a tea plantation, before {{travelling}} to China and Japan. The success of Algeria from Within made it <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> obtain work as a journalist in Asia. He became a foreign correspondent for The Sphere in London and The Advertiser in Australia. Bodley {{was one of several}} westerners to be granted access to the South Pacific Mandate by Japan in the 1930s, and he has been cited as one of the main sources of information on the area at the time. The South Pacific Mandate consisted of islands in the north Pacific Ocean that had been within the German colonial empire until occupied by Japan during World War I; Japan governed the islands under a League of Nations mandate. Like other westerners allowed to visit the region, he reported that {{there was no evidence that}} Japan was militarising the area. Bodley's movements were [...] "carefully choreographed" [...] by the Japanese Foreign Ministry. He wrote about his experiences and findings in his 1934 book The Drama in the Pacific, saying that [...] "having visited practically every island … I am convinced that nothing has been done to convert any place into a naval base". In his 1998 book Nan'yo: the Rise and Fall of the Japanese in Micronesia, 1885–1945, Mark Peattie stated that while it is easy to accuse Bodley and the other writers of naivety, the militarisation of the area was complex and occurred in several stages. Bodley was a passenger aboard the ship Shizuoka Maru when it was wrecked on a reef north of Yap in April 1933. The vessel was lost, though there were no injuries. Bodley was offered a job teaching English at Keio University, and did so for nine months; he wrote about the experience in his 1933 book A Japanese Omelette. Bodley and Keio professor Eishiro Hori provided voluminous notes in the 1934 Japanese textbook version of Round the Red Lamp by Arthur Conan Doyle, and in 1935 Bodley published a biography of Tōgō Heihachirō.|$|E
50|$|A bequest from Conrads {{uncle and}} mentor, Tadeusz Bobrowski (who had died on 1 January 1894) — which bequest Conrad, typically, would soon manage to lose — {{for the moment}} made it <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> retire from the sea and devote himself to a {{literary}} career.|$|R

5|$|Most of Leonardo's {{writings}} are in mirror-image cursive. While secrecy {{is often}} suggested {{as the reason}} for this style of writing, it may have been more of a practical expediency. Since Leonardo wrote with his left hand, it was probably <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> write from right to left.|$|R
500|$|Castellaneta also {{provides}} the voices for numerous other characters, including Grampa Simpson, Barney Gumble, Krusty the Clown, Groundskeeper Willie, Mayor Quimby, Hans Moleman, Sideshow Mel, Itchy, Kodos, the Squeaky Voiced Teen and Gil Gunderson. Krusty's voice {{is based on}} Chicago television's Bob Bell, who had a very raspy voice and portrayed WGN-TV's Bozo the Clown from 1960 to 1984. Barney's trademark is a loud belch. During early recording sessions for the show, he recorded {{a new version of}} the belch for every episode but discovered that it was not <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do it every time a script called for it. Castellaneta chose a recording of what he believed was his best belch and told the producers to make that the standard. Groundskeeper Willie's first appearance was in the season two episode [...] "Principal Charming". The character was written as an angry janitor and Castellaneta was assigned to perform the voice. He did not know what voice to use and Sam Simon, who was directing at the time, suggested he use an accent. Castellaneta first tried using a Hispanic voicing, which Simon felt was too clichéd. He then tried a [...] "big dumb Swede", which was also rejected. For his third try, he used the voice of an angry Scotsman, which was deemed appropriate enough and was used in the episode. The voice was based partially on Angus Crock, a kilt-wearing chef from the sketch comedy show Second City Television, who was portrayed by Dave Thomas. Mayor Quimby, who first appeared in [...] "Bart Gets an F", is a parody of various members of the Kennedy family. The episode script did not call for Quimby to be a parody of them, and Castellaneta improvised the accent. Sideshow Mel's voice is Castellaneta's impression of Kelsey Grammer, the voice of Sideshow Bob. Gil is a spoof of actor Jack Lemmon's portrayal of Shelley Levene in the 1992 film adaptation of the play Glengarry Glen Ross. Show runner Mike Scully thought that Gil would be [...] "a one-shot thing" [...] but [...] "Dan Castellaneta was so funny at the table read doing the character, we kept making up excuses in subsequent episodes to put him in." [...] The Blue-Haired Lawyer's voice, as well as his demeanor, is based on lawyer Roy Cohn.|$|E
2500|$|In 1904 the British army invaded {{and held}} the Tibetan Chumbi Valley, in the border region {{adjacent}} to Bhutan and India. Sir Charles Bell {{was put in charge}} of the district from September 1904 to November 1905 and wrote that slavery was still practiced in Chumbi but had declined greatly over the previous thirty years. He noted that only a dozen or two dozen slaves remained, unlike nearby Bhutan where slavery was more widespread. Bell further remarked, [...] "The slavery in the Chumpi valley was of a very mild type. If a slave was not well treated, it was <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> escape into Sikkim and British India." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 28 August, Admiral Story {{returned}} with his squadron to the Vlieter roadstead, where he anchored, because adverse winds {{made it impossible}} to attack the British. Enervated by the sight of the Orangist flags on the forts and church steeples of Den Helder, the crews of several of the ships then started to mutiny. Van Braam's ship Leyden was one of those. He later admitted {{that it would have been}} <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> quell the revolt, but he intentionally did nothing. Instead, he informed his commanding officer, Admiral Story (who himself had to counter an incipient mutiny on the flagship Washington) of the [...] "precarious situation" [...] aboard the other ships of the fleet.|$|E
50|$|In an {{interview}} with The A.V. Club, Bird mentioned that melodies are <b>easier</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> write than lyrics.
