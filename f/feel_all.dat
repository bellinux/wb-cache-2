25|$|Immediately {{following}} Willow's {{reconciliation with}} Tara, Warren (Adam Busch), {{one of the}} Trio, shoots Buffy; a stray shot kills Tara {{right in front of}} Willow. In an explosion of rage and grief, Willow soaks up all the dark magic she can, which turns her hair and eyes black. In the final episodes of the season Willow becomes exceedingly strong, surviving unharmed when Warren hits her in the back with an axe. She hunts Warren, tortures him by slowly pushing a bullet into his body, then kills him by magically flaying him. Unsatisfied, she attempts to kill the other two members of the Trio but is unsuccessful due to her weakening power. She solves this problem by killing her 'dealer' from earlier in the season and draining him of his magic. When she is confronted by Buffy they begin to fight, only to be stopped by Giles who has borrowed magic from a coven of wiccans. Willow successfully drains him of this borrowed magic, fulfilling his plan and causing her to <b>feel</b> <b>all</b> the pain of everyone in the world. She tries to ease the pain by destroying the world, finally to be stopped by Xander.|$|E

500|$|In May 1981, Canada's Wonderland Director of Rides and Ground Services Jim Wilson {{told the}} Toronto Star that The Wilde Beast (along {{with two of}} the other {{original}} coasters at the park, Scooby's Ghoster Coaster, and the Mighty Canadian Minebuster) was wooden thanks to the apparent popularity of different styles of rides. [...] "Experiments" [...] found that steel coasters weren't as popular or enjoyable to the public, [...] "the sound and <b>feel</b> <b>all</b> contribute to the thrill of the ride.

Swift was named an Icon of American Style by Vogue in 2011. In 2014 she topped People annual best dressed list. In 2015, she was named Woman of the Year at the Elle Style Awards, and ranked first in Maxim Hot 100 list.|$|E
500|$|Prison Break {{features}} a serialized story structure, {{similar to that}} of its first season companion show 24. At the 2009 TV Critics Press Tour, Kevin Reilly told reporters that the series would end with the fourth season. Despite decreasing ratings, Reilly attributed the cancellation to creativity: [...] "The show has just played out. You get to a point creatively where you <b>feel</b> <b>all</b> the stories have been told, and you want to end strong and not gimp out in the end of the season." [...] Regarding the finale, Reilly stated, [...] "They have a really cool ending, actually. I know where they end, and it's a hell of an idea." ...|$|E
500|$|We {{really wanted}} to spend time, immerse ourselves, drive {{for hours and hours}} aimlessly with a camera, jumping out and {{shooting}} things that caught my eye. We didn't want to go there and just shoot Frenchy's Chicken and call it an [...] "authentic video." [...] There was tons of hanging out, getting the <b>feel,</b> <b>all</b> with cameras ready. We hooked up with our dude Scotty who was a great help, plus Bun B's brother Truck, and Paul Wall. The city was so receptive, so willing to help, so open, and that leant a lot {{to the fact that we}} really got to glimpse of the real character of Houston.|$|E

500|$|Allemannische Gedichte {{was very}} successful, {{and a new}} edition was {{published}} a year later, this time crediting the author. When Hebel read the poems aloud to margrave Charles Frederick, the duke praised them, and Hebel noticed his exact local knowledge: [...] "I am surprised how the margrave knew all the villages, every small place, every shrub and hedge from Utzenfeld to Lörrach, and could always say: this is this, and yes, that's how it is." [...] In the following decades, further editions were released in Aarau, Vienna and Reutlingen. Famous poets such as Jean Paul (1803) and Goethe (1804) wrote reviews of the poems. Hebel was elated at this success and wrote in a letter: [...] "In certain moments I <b>feel</b> <b>all</b> proud inside, and as if drunk with happiness, that I could make our otherwise despised and ridiculed language so classical and give it such artistic fame".|$|E
500|$|Orci and Kurtzman read {{graduate}} school dissertations on the series for inspiration; they noted comparisons of Kirk, Spock and McCoy to Shakespearian archetypes, and Kirk and Spock's friendship echoing that of John Lennon and Paul McCartney. They also noted that, {{in the creation}} of this film, they were influenced by Star Wars, particularly in pacing. [...] "I want to feel the space, I want to feel speed and I want to <b>feel</b> <b>all</b> the things that can become a little bit lost when Star Trek becomes very stately" [...] said Orci. Star Wars permeated in the way they wrote the action sequences, while Burk noted Kirk and Spock's initially cold relationship mirrors how [...] "Han Solo wasn't friends with anyone when they started on their journey." [...] Spock and Uhura were put in an actual relationship as a nod to early episodes highlighting her interest in him. Orci wanted to introduce strong Starfleet captains, concurring with an interviewer that most captains in other films were [...] "patsies" [...] included to make Kirk look greater by comparison.|$|E
500|$|When Dewey Phillips first aired [...] "That's All Right" [...] on Memphis radio, many {{listeners}} who {{contacted the}} station by phone and telegram {{to ask for}} it again assumed that its singer was black. From {{the beginning of his}} national fame, Presley expressed respect for African American performers and their music, and disregard for the norms of segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the South. Interviewed in 1956, he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician Arthur Crudup—the originator of [...] "That's All Right"—"bang his box the way I do now, and I said if I ever got to the place where I could <b>feel</b> <b>all</b> old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw." [...] The Memphis World, an African American newspaper, reported that Presley, [...] "the rock 'n' roll phenomenon", [...] "cracked Memphis's segregation laws" [...] by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its [...] "colored night". Such statements and actions led Presley to be generally hailed in the black community during the early days of his stardom. By contrast, many white adults, according to Billboards Arnold Shaw, [...] "did not like him, and condemned him as depraved. Anti-negro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism. Regardless of whether parents were aware of the Negro sexual origins of the phrase 'rock 'n' roll', Presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex." ...|$|E

500|$|Framestore {{was chosen}} {{to work on the}} Cloak of Levitation, due to their work {{creating}} Rocket in Guardians of the Galaxy. Ceretti called Cloak's actions [...] "kind of scripted but not as deeply" [...] as the end result, and said that during the pre-visualization process [...] "we had a big discussion about the arc of the story of the Cloak in the film". Framestore also worked on environment shots, the Mandelbrot set sequences, high resolution digital doubles, the astral form, and the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak restraint for Kaecilius, totaling over 365 shots. Alexis Wajsbrot, Framestore's CG Supervisor, called the astral form [...] "one of the hardest effects we’ve had to deal with at Framestore; finding the right balance of a look that was subtle but also beautiful." [...] Lola VFX worked on the Zealots' eyes, supplementing the make-up work with effects based on a geode. They also created digital tears for Kaecilius when he is in the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak. In addition to Dormammu and the Dark Dimension, Luma Pictures also created the first mirror sequence {{at the beginning of the}} film. In creating Dormammu, Ceretti stated that they wanted to avoid the fiery head look from the comics as [...] "it had been done before. The whole idea is he's a character that lives in-between dimensions. He can also take whatever shapes he wants to take. [...] you can <b>feel</b> <b>all</b> these ripples in his face and all that stuff… these kind of opening windows to other dimensions, and all the reflective qualities of it. We really wanted to add the evocation of that fire, but we didn't want to do fire so we went for [...] multicolored approach to try and keep the psychedelic [...] of the entire space." [...] On the Dark Dimension, Ceretti said, [...] "We tried to make it alive all the time—the whole idea of the Dark Dimension is that it's a dynamic environment," [...] with the Luma team referencing the Ditko art and a poster that when lit [...] "with a blacklight it becomes very saturated [...] colors, crazy blacklight colors." [...] He continued, [...] "It was all about finding the right balance between all these elements to pay homage to and to tribute the work of Steve Ditko, but to make it more current to the 21st century. If you look at the detail of the shapes that we have in the Dark Dimension, you can almost point to things in the comic books [...] we really tried to be faithful to." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album's {{sustained}} run at No. 1 buoyed her self-assurance and bravery, and validated {{that people}} were willing to follow her even as she transitioned into adulthood.

2500|$|During the {{recording}} of [...] "A Hard Day's Night", Lennon and McCartney doubletracked their vocals throughout including the chorus.

[...] The words [...] "principles that recognize the supremacy of God and the rule of law" [...] also appear in the party's official policies regarding what they <b>feel</b> <b>all</b> laws should be based upon, and the party states that [...] "'Human rights' as expressed in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms can only, therefore, be legitimately interpreted in light of, or in conjunction with, the higher Moral Law of God." ...|$|E

[...] Colonel Thomas E. Rose, {{the leader of the}} escape, addressed the double-edged lack of light in Rat Hell: [...] "The profound darkness caused some...to become bewildered when they attempted to move about. [...] I sometimes had to <b>feel</b> <b>all</b> over the cellar to gather up the men that were lost." [...] Despite the difficulties, the dark repugnant atmosphere of Rat Hell offered the most effective cover. [...] "On rare occasions, guards entered the large basement rooms.

Devi from Behindwoods gave 3.5/5 and commented: [...] "The album {{promises}} {{a couple of}} big chart-busting hits like the peppy 'Ringa Ringa', the melodious 'Mun Andhi' and the pathos-ridden 'Yamma Yamma'. Though there is a déjà vu <b>feel</b> <b>all</b> around the album, its a sure shot commercial success". Indiaglitz stated that [...] "the unique stamp of Harris can be felt throughout the disc, and that makes songs [...] a treat to senses", recommending it for [...] "those who love and appreciate good music". Pavithra Srinivasan from Rediff provided 2.5/5, mentioning that [...] "it looks like Harris Jeyaraj has run out of steam. While Yemma Yemma and The Rise of Damo are appealing, the rest sound like he remixed some of his own older numbers, or chose to be inspired by other classics [...] 7aum Arivu's music does have its moments, but these are few and far between." [...] Prakash Upadhyaya from Oneindia.in said that the album had [...] "variety of songs. The soundtracks will have larger appeal when it is watched".|$|E

Billboard magazine officially confirmed Ciara's signing to Epic in September 2011. During an interview with Sway in the Morning in February 2012, Ciara revealed that she would be taking her time recording her fifth studio album. In June 2012, Ciara spoke about the album saying [...] "It really is just me pouring my heart into the record, and I think my fans deserve that.
