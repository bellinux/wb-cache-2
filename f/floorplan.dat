40|$|As {{transistors}} scale, system {{temperatures are}} rising, and with them, cooling costs. Faced with such challenges, designers {{have developed a}} variety of techniques to reduce temperatures at design-time, through <b>floorplanning,</b> and at run-time, using dynamic thermal management. Multi-core <b>floorplanning,</b> in particular, presents unique opportunities for temperature management: for example, cores can be individually <b>floorplanned</b> to reduce system temperature, and L 2 cache banks can be interleaved between cores to separate hot components and take advantage of spatial thermal filtering. In this paper, we present an evaluation of the potential thermal benefits of multi-core <b>floorplanning.</b> We evaluate techniques from the literature, including manipulating core orientation, L 2 cache bank insertion, and hierarchical <b>floorplanning,</b> and introduce two new techniques, core mingling and core scattering, in order to bound the potential benefits of temperature-aware <b>floorplanning.</b> For multi-core architectures up to 16 cores, we observe that simply inserting L 2 cache banks between identically <b>floorplanned</b> and oriented cores captures 82 % of the possible temperature reduction available to multi-core <b>floorplanning.</b> For many-core architectures, L 2 cache occupancy continues to have the most significant effect on temperature. This is good news for designers: while in principle, developing different <b>floorplans</b> for each instance of a core may further reduce temperatures, such techniques require substantial <b>floorplanning</b> effort and introduce new validation requirements and are not in fact necessary.

40|$|Minimizing the wirelength {{plays an}} {{important}} role in physical design automation of very large-scale integration (VLSI) chips. The objective of wirelength minimization can be achieved by finding an optimal solution for VLSI physical design components like partitioning and <b>floorplanning.</b> In VLSI circuit partitioning, the problem of obtaining a minimum delay has prime importance. In VLSI circuit <b>floorplanning,</b> the problem of minimizing silicon area is also a hot issue. Reducing the minimum delay in partitioning and area in <b>floorplanning</b> helps to minimize the wirelength. The enhancements in partitioning and <b>floorplanning</b> have influence on other criteria like power, cost, clock speed, and so forth. Memetic Algorithm (MA) is an Evolutionary Algorithm that includes one or more local search phases within its evolutionary cycle to obtain the minimum wirelength by reducing delay in partitioning and by reducing area in <b>floorplanning.</b> MA applies some sort of local search for optimization of VLSI partitioning and <b>floorplanning.</b> The algorithm combines a hierarchical design technique like genetic algorithm and constructive technique like Simulated Annealing for local search to solve VLSI partitioning and <b>floorplanning</b> problem.

40|$|Large macro blocks, pre-designed datapaths, {{embedded}} {{memories and}} analog blocks are increasingly used in ASIC designs. However, robust algorithms for large-scale placement of such designs {{have only recently}} been considered in the literature, and improvements by over 10 % per paper are still common. Large macros can be handled by traditional <b>floorplanning,</b> but are harder to account for in min-cut and analytical placement. On the other hand, traditional <b>floorplanning</b> techniques do not scale to large numbers of objects, {{especially in terms of}} solution quality. We propose to integrate min-cut placement with fixed-outline <b>floorplanning</b> to solve the more general placement problem, which includes cell placement, <b>floorplanning,</b> mixed-size placement and achieving routability. At every step of min-cut placement, either partitioning or wirelength-driven, fixed-outline <b>floorplanning</b> is invoked.

25|$|It {{is often}} assumed that Fordism derives from Taylor's work. Taylor {{apparently}} made this assumption himself when visiting the Ford Motor Company's Michigan plants {{not too long}} before he died, but {{it is likely that}} the methods at Ford were evolved independently, and that any influence from Taylor's work was indirect at best. Charles E. Sorensen, a principal of the company during its first four decades, disclaimed any connection at all. There was a belief at Ford, which remained dominant until Henry Ford II took over the company in 1945, that the world's experts were worthless, because if Ford had listened to them, it would have failed to attain its great successes. Henry Ford felt that he had succeeded in spite of, not because of, experts, who had tried to stop him in various ways (disagreeing about price points, production methods, car features, business financing, and other issues). Sorensen thus was dismissive of Taylor and lumped him into the category of useless experts. Sorensen held the New England machine tool vendor Walter Flanders in high esteem and credits him for the efficient <b>floorplan</b> layout at Ford, claiming that Flanders knew nothing about Taylor. Flanders may have been exposed to the spirit of Taylorism elsewhere, and may have been influenced by it, but he did not cite it when developing his production technique. Regardless, the Ford team apparently did independently invent modern mass production techniques in the period of 1905-1915, and they themselves were not aware of any borrowing from Taylorism. Perhaps it is only possible with hindsight to see the zeitgeist that (indirectly) connected the budding Fordism to the rest of the efficiency movement during the decade of 1905-1915.|$|E
