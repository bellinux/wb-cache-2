25|$|Stephen Baskerville {{states that}} shared {{parenting}} {{has been demonstrated}} to reduce parental conflict by requiring parents to cooperate and compromise, {{and that it is}} the lack of constraint by one parent resulting from the ability of that parent to exclude the other, that results in increased parental conflict. He further states that only when child support guidelines exceed true costs do parents ask for or seek to prevent changes in parenting time for financial reasons, adding that any argument that a parent is asking for increased parenting time to reduce child support <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> an argument that the other parent is making a profit from child support.|$|E

But {{confusion}} sets in for the poor girl because of mistaken identity. She is unable to make up her mind about love and says, [...] "The first love is the true love, and one loves only once." [...] But Kierkegaard says this is sophistry [...] "because the category first, <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> a qualitative and a numerical category." [...] Her first impression of love, when she was eight, has become decisive for her whole life. [...] Now she can love only to a certain degree because she's comparing each new experience with the past experience. Kierkegaard discussed this again in 1845.|$|E
500|$|On December 23, 1994, the Republic of Kiribati {{announced}} {{a change of}} time zone for the Line Islands, to take effect January 1, 1995. This adjustment effectively moved the International Date Line over [...] to the east within Kiribati, placing all of Kiribati on the Asian or {{western side of the}} date line, despite the fact that Caroline's longitude of 150 degrees west corresponds to UTC−10 rather than its official time zone of UTC+14. Caroline Island now <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> as the Hawaiian Islands (Hawaii-Aleutian Standard Time Zone), but one day ahead. This move made Caroline Island both the easternmost land in the earliest time zone (by some definitions, the easternmost point on Earth), {{and one of the first}} points of land which would see sunrise on January 1, 2000 — at 5:43a.m., as measured by local time.|$|E
500|$|In Poland and Ukraine, borscht {{is usually}} {{one of the}} dishes served at a Christmas Eve dinner.

Christmas Eve borscht is, therefore, either vegetarian or based on fish stock and is not typically mixed with sour cream. In Ukraine, the soup contains vegetables that are sautéed in vegetable oil rather than lard, as well as beans and mushrooms. It may be also thickened with wheat flour dry-roasted in a pan instead of the usual roux. The Polish version of Christmas Eve borscht is a clear ruby-red broth. Both Ukrainian and Polish variants are often served with [...]|$|E

500|$|Due to falling crime rates, {{fewer people}} {{felt the need}} to carry a firearm for {{protection}} after 2000. This trend however changed in 2015 following the European migrant crisis and November 2015 Paris attacks. Gun advocacy groups argue that {{there is no point in}} banning guns because criminals will get guns no matter how tight the law <b>is.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> however, the rules are deemed to be restrictive enough to prevent criminals from easily obtaining firearms, while allowing upstanding citizens to own them for personal protection. For example, in 2010, a Norwegian terrorist, incited by reports of British newspapers describing Prague as [...] "being the most important transit site point for illicit weapons in Europe", found himself unable to obtain any in the country when preparing for the 2011 Norway attacks. Similarly, a Polish terrorist obtained guns illegally in 1200km distant Belgium, despite living mere 70km from the Czech border. Also, the fact that Czech Republic has a strong tradition in firearms manufacturing and competition shooting contributes to generally moderate attitude to gun control.|$|E
500|$|In {{terms of}} energy: surface tension [...] of a liquid is {{the ratio of}} the change in the energy of the liquid, and the change in the surface area of the liquid (that led to the change in energy). This can be easily related to the {{previous}} definition in terms of force: if [...] is the force required to stop the side from starting to slide, then this is also the force that would keep the side in the state of sliding at a constant speed (by Newton's Second Law). But if the side is moving to the right (in the direction the force is applied), then the surface area of the stretched liquid is increasing while the applied force is doing work on the liquid. This means that increasing the surface area increases the energy of the film. The work done by the force [...] in moving the side by distance [...] <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> the total area of the film increases by [...] (the factor of 2 is here because the liquid has two sides, two surfaces).

500|$|Asked {{about the}} motif and [...] "casual {{approach}} to" [...] bisexual characters in his novels, continued in Imperial Bedrooms, Ellis stated he [...] "really [...] know", {{and that he}} wished he could provide [...] "an answer – depicting [...] as extremely conscious of those choices". He believes it to be an [...] "interesting aspect of [...] work". Details notes how Ellis' own sexuality, frequently described as bisexual, has been notoriously hard to pin down. Reviewers have long tried to probe Ellis on autobiographical themes in his work. He reiterates to Vice that he is not Clay. Ellis says that other contemporary authors (naming Michael Chabon, Jonathan Franzen, Jonathan Lethem as examples) don't get asked if their novels are autobiographical. (However, Ellis tells one interview, that he [...] "cannot fully" [...] say that [...] "I'm not Clay" [...] because of their emotional [...] "connections".) Vice attributes this streak to Ellis' age when Less Than Zero came out, which led to him being seen as a voice-of-the-generation. Ellis feels that the autobiographical truths of his novels lie in their writing processes, which to him are like emotional [...] "exorcisms". Crace's abovementioned parody suggests that Less Than Zero Clay was originally a flattering portrayal of Ellis. Ellis discusses lightly the kinds of self-insertion present in the book. While Clay is clearly (parodically) working on the film adaptation of The Informers, he <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> fully aware that he has been a character in Less Than Zero, and that ostensibly, Ellis is 'the author' whom Clay knew. However, there are clear differences to the characters, as well. For example, Ellis had to omit lines from the book he felt Clay would never have thought of, on subjects he would never have noticed. Ellis himself feels he is adapting to middle-age very well; Clay, however, isn't.|$|E

Having grown weary of her uneventful provincial life, {{in which she}} is relentlessly romantically pursued by an arrogant hunter named Gaston, Belle longs for adventure. After her father's horse returns without its rider, she willingly ventures into the woods in search of her father. She persuades the Beast that she will trade her own freedom in return for her father's, since her father is ill in the dungeon, promising to remain with the Beast in his castle among his staff of enchanted objects forever. Belle's curiosity leads her to the forbidden west wing where she discovers an enchanted rose without realizing that it {{is tied to the}} Beast's fate; and the Beast's rage at her trespassing causes her to flee the castle on horseback. [...] Belle is pursued by wolves in the woods but they are driven off by the Beast, afterwards Belle helps the injured Beast back to the castle and nurses him back to health. Although she initially dislikes her captor, Belle gradually learns to accept the Beast in spite of his appearance and eventually befriends him. Belle and the Beast's strong bond greatly envies Gaston to the point of which he storms the castle and mortally wounds the Beast, though Gaston falls to his own death in the process. However, Belle confesses her love for the Beast just in time to break the spell under which he had been placed by an enchantress as punishment for his selfish ways, and the Beast ultimately transforms back into a handsome prince.|$|E
