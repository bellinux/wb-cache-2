40|$|Concepts with {{defining}} features have sufficiently rigid {{boundaries that}} examples of one concept are rarely confused with another concept, whereas probabilistic concepts <b>have</b> <b>vague</b> <b>boundaries,</b> producing frequent misclassifications. It {{has been argued}} that, although neural learning might account for probabilistic (or fuzzy) concepts, it is incapable of accounting for acquisition of concepts with defining features. Simulations reported here with encoder networks call this view into question. These sibling-descendant cascade-correlation networks account {{for a variety of}} phenomena with concepts positioned along the probabilistic to defining-features continuum. Classification of exemplars by our networks was affected by both isolation of the concept in semantic feature space and by dispersion of its examples around a prototype. The detection of defining features cured networks from the effects of conceptual crowding and example dispersion. Simulations captured the developmental shift from characteristic to defining features in a natural way...|$|E
40|$|I {{begin with}} a {{description}} of the benefits and limits of DNA barcoding as presented by its advocates not its critics. Next, I argue that due to the mutually dependent relationship between defining and delimiting species, all systems of classification are grounded in theory, even if only implicitly. I then proceed to evaluate DNA barcoding in that context. In particular, I focus on the barcoders’ use of a sharp boundary by which to delimit species, arguing that this boundary brings along additional theoretical commitments inconsistent with the way taxonomists conceive of species, viz., as entities that <b>have</b> <b>vague</b> <b>boundaries</b> and that cannot be defined by any single attribute other than ancestry. Given these inconsistencies, I conclude that even if groupings based on DNA barcodes match those of an existing taxonomy, the two systems of classification are not necessarily tracking the same entities, i. e., species...|$|E

50|$|The {{olfactory}} receptor neurons in {{the antenna}} and maxillary palps project into the olfactory lobes of the insect brain, {{which in turn}} project the higher order processing centers, the lateral horn or the mushroom bodies. The lateral horn <b>has</b> <b>vague</b> <b>boundaries</b> in the brain but is bordered by {{the ends of the}} branching of projecting neurons in the lateral protocerebrum. There are at least 10 morphological classes of lateral horn neurons. This system is highly conserved throughout the insect world.|$|R
30|$|To begin with, Lopes (2007) has {{maintained}} that while according to standard Western ontology an architectural work is an object token and, more specifically, a material building, in traditional Japanese ontology architectural works are event tokens, which may also include {{one or more}} round of reconstruction. 5 This explains {{how it is possible}} that tourists visiting today the goshoden (the main sanctified structure) of the Ise Jingu, {{one of the most important}} and most visited Shinto shrines in Japan, do visit the same architectural work “launched” in the eighth century CE although the goshoden itself has been rebuilt about every twenty years, each time in one of two adjacent lots, introducing numerous changes in material and spatial specifications from one rebuilding to the next. 6 Also consider not only that events—differently from objects—are commonly conceived as having temporal parts, that is, parts corresponding to the intervals or moments through which they perdure (Simons 2000), 7 but also that, while objects are supposed to have relatively crisp spatial <b>boundaries</b> and <b>vague</b> temporal <b>boundaries,</b> events, by contrast, would <b>have</b> relatively <b>vague</b> spatial <b>boundaries</b> and crisp temporal boundaries (Casati and Varzi 2015). Thus acknowledging that in traditional Japanese ontology architectural works are event tokens would account for traditional Japanese vernacular architecture’s employing ephemeral building materials (because there is nothing wrong with events ending), and even for Japanese modernism’s putting up works for a very brief lifespan (think of Toyo Ito’s Nomad Restaurant, 1986).|$|R

40|$|Purpose. Development of the {{reliability}} calculating methodology of fuzzy systems with components, reliability parameters {{of which are}} described by the membership functions of various kinds. Methodology. Systematic analysis of the known approaches to the assessment of {{the reliability}} of fuzzy systems with <b>vague</b> <b>boundaries</b> and different kinds of membership functions. Findings. A unified description and the new tabular algorithm of various arithmetic operations run between the various types of fuzzy sets are proposed and tabular methods of reliability analysis of the basic structures of fuzzy systems are developed. Originality. A generalized description of triangular and trapezoid-shaped accessory functions of fuzzy boundaries in a special tuples is introduced, analytical expressions for the formation of tabular schedules of their functions and the calculation of the reliability of fuzzy systems with complex structures are obtained: sequential, redundant - parallel, serial-parallel, parallel-serial. The practical value.
