60|$|MRS. G. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> Hyder {{could attend}} to it. I {{left him in}} the veranda, stirring--when I hurt myself so.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, 'Smothers!'" [...] exclaimed Morley. [...] "Sol Smothers? Why, {{he lives}} in the next house to me. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> 'Smithers.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{have found}} that out sooner than <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> would,' <b>said</b> the landlord, composedly. 'Yes, he's dead, sure enough. He died at five o'clock to-day.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! my lord, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> dead. They <b>said</b> {{that they}} had come to kill you by command of the Jew Caleb, he who gave the evidence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have found}} that out sooner than <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> would," [...] <b>said</b> the landlord, composedly. [...] "Yes, he's dead, sure enough. He died at five o'clock to-day." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That is a change! <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> the billiards and cards paid well; but I {{suppose you}} have got {{something}} better in view?" ...|$|E
6000|$|LADY (innocently). <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> you won {{the battle}} of Lodi for your country, General Bu-- shall I {{pronounce}} it in Italian or French? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{words are}} these, Tripp?" [...] <b>said</b> <b>I.</b> [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> had a story. Every {{ferryboat}} that crosses the East River brings or takes away girls from Long Island." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly not, but I'm not {{speaking}} from {{his point of}} view." [...] Nash was perfectly lucid. [...] "Moreover, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> just now <b>said</b> it would be such a good thing for her." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was time}} for dinner, and Walter hurried off arm in arm with Si, who was still {{somewhat}} worked up over what had happened. [...] "Walter, don't you go for to imagine <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> guilty," [...] <b>said</b> the Yankee boy. [...] "I know you are honest to the core." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Time;--yes; but cannot we arrange some {{plan for}} the future? Cannot {{something}} be done? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> you would ask her to come here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You shouldn't slur {{your words}} so. For a moment <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> 'half of one per cent. One {{and a half}} of course you really said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not {{with your}} {{immediate}} future. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> {{that you were}} trying to get a job. Have you given up the idea of newspaper work, then?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen!" [...] he urged. [...] "I don't {{want to do}} {{anything}} you wouldn't like, and honestly I don't know what I'd do if you left me. I've come to depend on you. And you may not believe it, but when I got that Bradlaugh order <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>you,</b> <b>I</b> <b>said</b> to myself 'She'll be pleased, she'll help me to put it over.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was feeling}} better, Ned," [...] she said sharply; [...] "but your {{unpleasant}} way of talking, and your nonsense about {{taking care of}} me, have made me feel quite ill again. Somehow you always seem to shake my nerves. You never seem to me like other boys. One would think I was a child instead of being your mother. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> after what <b>you</b> <b>said</b> {{to me that you}} were going to behave nicely." ...|$|R
6000|$|Fulkerson pulled {{first one}} of his blond {{whiskers}} and then the other, and twisted {{the end of each}} into a point, which he left to untwine itself. He fixed March with his little eyes, which had a curious innocence in their cunning, and tapped the desk immediately in front of him. [...] "What I like about you is that you're broad in your sympathies. The first time I saw you, that night on the Quebec boat, I said to myself: 'There's a man I want to know. There's a human being.' I was a little afraid of Mrs. March and the children, but I felt at home with you--thoroughly domesticated--before I passed a word with you; and when you spoke first, and opened up with a joke over that fellow's tableful of light literature and Indian moccasins and birch-bark toy canoes and stereoscopic views, I knew that we were brothers-spiritual twins. I recognized the Western style of fun, and <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> when <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> were from Boston, that it was some of the same. But I see now that its being a cold fact, as far as the last fifteen or twenty years count, is just so much gain. You know both sections, and you can make this thing go, from ocean to ocean." ...|$|R
6000|$|Algernon. But <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that [...] . Miss Cardew was {{a little}} too much {{interested}} in your poor brother Ernest? Won't she feel his loss a good deal? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Burnt down, Dias! I {{am sorry}} indeed to hear that. How did it happen? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> {{that you had}} locked it up, and left no one there." ...|$|E
6000|$|His {{face grew}} ashen. [...] "It is true, then!" [...] he asked her. [...] "And {{what you said}} to-night was true! <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> it only to detain me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I get news--and what heartbreaking news!--of my father, {{by sending}} a {{messenger}} to Selina. It is more than ever impossible that I can put myself {{in the way of}} seeing Helena again. She has written to me about Philip, in a tone so shockingly insolent and cruel, that I have destroyed her letter. Philip's visit to the farm, discovered I don't know how, seems to have infuriated her. She accuses me of doing all that she might herself have done in my place, and threatens me--No! I am afraid of the wicked whisperings of that second self of mine if I think of it. They were near to tempting me when I read Helena's letter. But <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of what <b>you</b> <b>said,</b> after I had shown you my Journal; and your words took my memory back to the days when I was happy with Philip. The trial and the terror passed away.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> {{your subject}} was of {{national}} concern. Upon my word, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> proposed {{to hold a}} thanksgiving service in Little Primpton Church {{for the success of}} the British arms." ...|$|R
6000|$|Newman {{passed his}} hand into his hair and stood slowly rubbing his head and looking through his keenly-narrowed eyes {{from one to the}} other of the three persons before him. His lips were compressed, and the two lines which had formed {{themselves}} beside his mouth might have made it appear at a first glance that he was smiling. I have said that his excitement was an intenser deliberateness, and now he looked grimly deliberate. [...] "It seems very much as if you had interfered, marquis," [...] he said slowly. [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't interfere. I know you don't like me; but that doesn't make any difference. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> promised me <b>you</b> wouldn't interfere. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> swore on your honor that you wouldn't interfere. Don't you remember, marquis?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At Cedar Lodge. It's {{several miles}} from here," [...] {{answered}} Jack. And then he continued: [...] "You belong around here? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> {{you had a}} farm near Enwood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Promised?' said Stephen with wide-opened eyes. She {{had no idea}} of sparing him, {{she remembered}} the printed names. 'Why, Leonard, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> you were unable to pay any of those debts?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think it's necessary," [...] said Kenton, haughtily, [...] "There's {{only one}} thing that could give him {{the right to know}} it, and we'll wait for that first. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> that he was frivolous." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Alas! it is true," [...] Siegbert replied; [...] "and {{that is why}} I {{sent for}} you. I have never been good friends with Bijorn since the {{wounding}} of his son, but after a time the matter blew over. Sweyn, who though but with one arm, and that the left, {{has grown into a}} valiant warrior, is now, Bijorn being dead, one of our boldest vikings. A year since he became a declared suitor for Freda's hand. In this, indeed, he is not alone, seeing that she has grown up one of our fairest maidens, and many are the valorous deeds that have been done to win a smile from her; but she has refused all suitors, Sweyn with the others. He took his refusal in bad part, and even ventured to vow she should be his whether she willed it or not. Of course I took the matter up and forbade all further intimacy, and we had not met again till the other day before Paris. We had high words there, but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> no more of it. A few days afterwards I was struck by a crossbow bolt in the leg. It smashed my knee, and I shall never be able to use my leg again. I well-nigh died of fever and vexation, but Freda nursed me through it. She had me carried on a litter here to be away from the noise and revelry of the camp. Last night there was a sudden outcry. Some of my men who sprang to arms were smitten down, and the assailants burst in here and tore Freda, shrieking, away. Their leader was Sweyn of the left hand. As I lay tossing here, mad with the misfortune which ties me to my couch, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>you.</b> <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'If any can follow and recapture Freda it is Edmund.' The Danes had for the most part moved away, and there were few would care to risk a quarrel with Sweyn in a matter which concerned them not closely; but I felt that I could rely upon you, and that you would spare no pains to rescue my child." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You take an {{interest}} in golf, Margaret? <b>You!</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> scorned it, considered it an unintellectual game. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> considered all games unintellectual.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dan, you're {{a little}} bit more of a real man than <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> were. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> were willing to do {{anything}} against me and my brothers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you won't see {{anything}} of her, Georgie. She's busy with her music or her mother all day. Besides, you're {{going up to}} town tomorrow, aren't you? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> something about an Institute meeting?" [...] The mother spoke.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Luke,' says he, 'I'm pretty hungry {{after our}} ride. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> {{they had some}} beans here. I'm going out and get {{something}} I can eat. You can stay and monkey with this artificial layout of grub if you want to.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'By Jove,' {{said the}} major, with {{elevated}} eyes, 'not been at Algiers! why, Mr. Consul, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> <b>said</b> Mr. Ferrers {{was a very}} great traveller indeed; {{and he has not}} been at Algiers! I consider Algiers more worth seeing than any place we ever visited. Don't you, Ormsby?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> {{believed}} that, Mademoiselle, if <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> {{were like}} so many of your countrywomen in this respect, I should leave to-morrow," [...] he declared.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{is n't the}} word, perhaps. We'll say {{ashamed of}} myself. Mrs. Maynard told me about <b>you,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> would despise me for not doing or being {{anything}} in particular. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> must." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>you</b> meant Miss Graham. Mrs. Bowen is my contemporary, and so I didn't {{think of}} her when <b>you</b> <b>said</b> young. I should have called her pretty rather than beautiful." ...|$|R
