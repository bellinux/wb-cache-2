50|$|In medicine, a Holter monitor (often simply Holter) {{is a type}} of {{ambulatory}} <b>electrocardiography</b> <b>device,</b> {{a portable}} device for cardiac monitoring (the monitoring of the electrical activity of the cardiovascular system) for at least 24 hours (often for two weeks at a time).|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{examine whether}} {{bacteria}} are transferred between {{the hands of}} medical staff and high-frequency contact surfaces within and between departments of a major metropolitan hospital, and to further analyze the patterns of cross-transmission. MethodsMicrobiological samples were collected {{from the hands of}} 112 hospital employees as well as from 120 high-frequency contact surfaces in four hospital departments. Samples were collected on agar plates, analyzed for the presence of Staphylococcus aureus or methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) by standard microbiology testing, and partially genotyped using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. ResultsGenetically identical MRSA was identified on the surface of an <b>electrocardiography</b> <b>device</b> in the medical intensive care unit and on the same type of device in the neurosurgical unit. Genetically similar S. aureus was identified on an infusion pump in the medical intensive care unit and on the hands of several doctors in a different department who regularly use that pump. Genetically identical S. aureus was also identified on bedside rail restraint in the medical intensive care unit and on the hands of the nurse in the neurosurgical unit. Finally, genetically similar MRSA was identified both on the surface of an <b>electrocardiography</b> <b>device</b> and on the suction apparatus in the medical intensive care unit. ConclusionCross-contamination of S. aureus or MRSA on medical workers' hands and contact surfaces was demonstrated within and between departments of a large metropolitan hospital. Improvements are needed in medical staff hygiene habits and in the cleaning of high-frequency contact surfaces to help prevent and control nosocomial infections...|$|R
40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: Frequent supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias {{during and after}} exercise are considered pathological in horses. Prevalence of arrhythmias seen in apparently healthy horses is still {{a matter of debate}} and may depend on breed, athletic condition and exercise intensity. Objectives: To determine intra- and interobserver agreement for detection of arrhythmias at rest, during and after exercise using a telemetric <b>electrocardiography</b> <b>device.</b> Materials and methods: The electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of 10 healthy Warmblood horses (5 of which had an intracardiac catheter in place) undergoing a standardised treadmill exercise test were analysed at rest (R), during warm-up (W), during exercise (E), as well as during 0 – 5 min (PE 0 – 5) and 6 – 45 min (PE 6 – 45) recovery after exercise. The number and time of occurrence of physiological and pathological ‘rhythm events’ were recorded. Events were classified according to origin and mode of conduction. The agreement of 3 independent, blinded observers with different experience in ECG reading was estimated considering time of occurrence and classification of events. Results: For correct timing and classification, intraobserver agreement for observer 1 was 97...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation, {{the world}} 2 ̆ 7 s most common arrhythmia, {{is a leading}} risk factor for stroke, a disease {{striking}} nearly 1. 6 million Indians annually. Early detection and management of atrial fibrillation is a promising opportunity to prevent stroke but widespread screening programs in limited resource settings using conventional methods is difficult and costly. OBJECTIVE: The objective {{of this study is}} to screen people for atrial fibrillation in rural western India using a US Food and Drug Administration-approved single-lead <b>electrocardiography</b> <b>device,</b> Alivecor. METHODS: Residents from 6 villages in Anand District, Gujarat, India, comprised the base population. After obtaining informed consent, a team of trained research coordinators and community health workers enrolled a total of 354 participants aged 50 years and older and screened them at their residences using Alivecor for 2 minutes on 5 consecutive days over a period of 6 weeks beginning June, 2015. RESULTS: Almost two-thirds of study participants were 55 years or older, nearly half were female, one-third did not receive any formal education, and more than one-half were from households earning less than US 2 per day. Twelve participants screened positive for atrial fibrillation yielding a sample prevalence of 5. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{studies with}} {{near-infrared}} spectroscopy, the recorded signals contain {{information on the}} temporal interbeat intervals of the heart. If this cardiac information is needed exclusively and could directly be extracted, an additional <b>electrocardiography</b> <b>device</b> would be unnecessary. The aim was to estimate these intervals from signals measured with near-infrared spectroscopy with two novel approaches. In one approach, we model the heartbeat oscillations in these signals with a Fourier series where the coefficients and the fundamental frequency can continuously change over time. The time-dependent model parameters are estimated and {{used to calculate the}} interbeat intervals. The second approach uses empirical mode decomposition. The signal measured with near-infrared spectroscopy is empirically decomposed into a set of oscillatory components. The sum of a specific subset of them is an estimate of the pure heartbeat signal in which the diastolic peaks and consequential interbeat intervals are detected. We show in simultaneous electrocardiography and near-infrared spectroscopy measurements on 11 subjects (8 men and 3 woman with mean age 32. 8 ± 8. 1 yr), that the interbeat intervals (and the consequential pulse rate variability measures), estimated using the proposed approaches, are in high agreement with their correspondents from electrocardiography...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{electrocardiography}} (ECG) uses a constructed reference {{potential for}} the majority of leads. This reference potential, named after its inventor as the Wilson central terminal, is assumed to have negligible value and to be stationary during the cardiac cycle. However, the problem of its variability during the cardiac cycle has been known almost since the inception of 12 -lead electrocardiography. Due to the cumbersomeness of the measurement system required to fully appreciate these variations, this topic has received scant research attention during the last 60 years. Taking advantage of modern electronic amplifiers’ capability to detect small voltages, drawing only femtoamperes from physiological equivalent signal sources and of the right-leg connection availability, we developed a complete <b>electrocardiography</b> <b>device</b> that, aside from the eight independent signals of the standard 12 -lead ECG, allows direct recording of the Wilson central terminal components. In this paper, we present details of the circuit together with its initial clinical evaluation. For this trial, we recorded data from 44 volunteer patients at Campbelltown Hospital (Campbelltown, Australia) and we found that the Wilson central terminal amplitude, as foreseen by Frank and others in the 1950 s, is not negligible, its amplitude in relation to the lead II is, on average, 51. 2 %, and thus it may be clinically relevan...|$|R
40|$|Since its {{invention}} (more than 80 years ago), modern electrocardiography has {{employed a}} supposedly stable voltage reference (with little variation during the cardiac cycle) {{for half of}} the signals. This reference, known {{by the name of}} “Wilson Central Terminal” in honor of its inventor, is obtained by averaging the three active limb electrode voltages measured with respect to the return ground electrode. However, concerns have been raised by researchers about problems (biasing and misdiagnosis) associated with the ambiguous value and behavior of this reference voltage, which requires perfect and balanced contact of at least four electrodes to work properly. The Wilson Central Terminal has received scant research attention in the last few decades even though consideration of recent widespread medical practice (limb electrodes are repositioned closer to the torso for resting electrocardiography) has also sparkled concerns about the validity and diagnostic fitness of leads not referred to the Wilson Central Terminal. Using a true unipolar <b>electrocardiography</b> <b>device</b> capable of precisely measuring the Wilson Central Terminal, we show its unpredictable variability during the cardiac cycle and confirm that the integrity of cardinal leads is compromised as well as the Wilson Central Terminal when limb electrodes are placed close to the torso...|$|R
40|$|Part 4 : Services over Mobile NetworksInternational audienceMachine-to-Machine (M 2 M) {{communication}} {{is expected to}} play a major role within the coming years towards the development of e-healthcare applications. The design of cellular networks, such as Long Term Evolution (LTE), is optimized to serve the data traffic of human-based communication with broadband requirements. E-healthcare traffic has different characteristics such as small packet sizes, narrowband requirements and huge number of devices. The focus of this work is to investigate the impact of e-healthcare traffic on LTE cellular networks. We develop a possible future scenario of <b>electrocardiography</b> (ECG) <b>devices</b> performing remote monitoring of patients with mobility support in our LTE simulation model. Regular LTE traffic is also deployed in the network and the influence of the varying ECG traffic is examined. The simulation results indicate that the e-healthcare related data traffic has a drastic influence on regular LTE traffic...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a wireless system to send biosignals outside a hyperbaric chamber avoiding wires {{going through the}} chamber walls. Hyperbaric chambers {{are becoming more and}} more common due to new indications of hyperbaric oxygen treatments. Metallic walls physically isolate patients inside the chamber, where getting a patient's vital signs turns into a painstaking task. The paper proposes using a ZigBee-based network to wirelessly transmit the patient's biosignals to the outside of the chamber. In particular, a wearable battery supported device has been designed, implemented and tested. Although the implementation has been conducted to transmit the <b>electrocardiography</b> signal, the <b>device</b> can be easily adapted to consider other biosignals...|$|R
40|$|Background: Remote {{cardiac rhythm}} {{monitoring}} and diagnosis {{has been well}} incorporated in the telehealth service model. The prevalence and incidence of abnormal ventricular beats, based on utilizing a symptom-driven portable remote <b>electrocardiography</b> (ECG) <b>device,</b> remains less well explored. Methods: We studied 339 consecutive study participants, which included 192 individuals from outpatient clinics who were enrolled via a symptom-driven protocol; 147 participated in a heart rhythm screening program. All participants underwent 24 -hour data transfer using a handheld portable electrocardiogram (ECG) device (DailyCare Biomedical Inc., Taoyuan City, Taiwan) with automatic ECG wavelet data extraction software (InstantCheck, version 4. 0; DailyCare Biomedical Inc., Taoyuan City, Taiwan). Results: Among 1152 data transferred (98. 4 % success rate), we noticed 32. 5 % of the study participants had evidence of cardiac arrhythmias with permanent or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) constituting 50. 9 % of arrhythmias. Individuals {{with a history of}} heart failure (odds ratio [OR], 3. 37; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 69 – 6. 74), diabetes (OR, 3. 03; 95 % CI, 1. 67 – 5. 49), and cardiovascular disease (OR, 3. 71; 95 % CI, 2. 05 – 6. 7) had a higher AF risk. Both populations had an age-related increase in AF, even in multivariate models (OR, 1. 72; 95 % CI, 1. 31 – 2. 24 per +decade). Conclusion: The handheld ECG device shows clinical feasibility with high rate for AF detection with a similar trend toward a higher prevalence with aging from different settings. These data suggested that portable ECG device via remote care system may aid in clinical diagnosis, therapeutic interventions, or patient referral for cardiac arrhythmias...|$|R
40|$|Background: We {{performed}} {{this study}} to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of a new mobile <b>electrocardiography</b> (ECG) <b>device,</b> ER- 2000 ®, in detecting cardiac arrhythmia, by comparing it to a 12 -lead ECG used as the gold standard. Methods: Mode 1 of ER- 2000 ® was recorded using three electrodes with cables attached to the anterior chest wall, and mode 2 was recorded using the side chest channel and finger channel. Standard 12 -lead ECG was used to record with a speed of 25  mm/s, simultaneously. Results: Seventeen patients with complaints of palpitation were enrolled. Twelve-lead ECG revealed normal sinus rhythm in three patients, sinus tachycardia in one, atrial fibrillation (AF) in two, atrial tachycardia (AT) in one, first degree atrioventricular block in one, pacing rhythm in two patients who underwent permanent pacemaker implantation, AF with intermittent ventricular pacing in one, complete right bundle branch block in one, J-wave elevation in one, narrow QRS tachycardia in one, atrial premature beat (APB) in one, ventricular premature beat (VPB) in one, and narrow QRS tachycardia with intermittent aberrant conduction in one. Rhythm diagnosis obtained by the two different modes of ER- 2000 ® was correlated with that obtained by the 12 -lead ECG in all patients except in one in whom ER- 2000 ® showed one APB while 12 -lead ECG showed sinus rhythm. R-R interval was accurately recorded despite the detailed morphology of QRS, and T-wave was somewhat modified {{with the use of}} ER- 2000 ®. A pacing blip detected by 12 -lead ECG was not detected by ER- 2000 ® despite a similar wide QRS duration in the paced QRS. Conclusions: A rhythm strip obtained using ER- 2000 ® is accurate in diagnosing arrhythmia, despite some differences in the detailed morphology of the QRS and T-wave, and the pacing spike compared to those obtained by the 12 -lead ECG...|$|R

5000|$|Wireless {{ambulatory}} electrocardiography (ECG) {{is a type}} of ambulatory <b>electrocardiography</b> with recording <b>devices</b> {{that use}} wireless technology, such as Bluetooth and smartphones, for at-home cardiac monitoring (monitoring of heart rhythms). These devices are generally recommended to people who have been previously diagnosed with arrhythmias and want to have them monitored, or for those who have suspected arrhythmias and need to be monitored {{over an extended period of}} time in order to be diagnosed. [...] Wireless Ambulatory ECGs work in a way similar to a regular ECG by measuring the electrical potential of the heart through the skin. The data is saved on an application on a Smart Phone, and then uploaded to a computer through Bluetooth or Cloud technologies. The information can also be sent through these technologies or through email to a doctor or cardiac technician. [...] Wireless Ambulatory ECGs are able to provide voice alarm messages when cardiac abnormalities occur, such as bradycardia, and can record this information and provide a screen prompt for the patient to view the data. The devices can also store mass amounts of ECG data on the phone, replay the ECG readings at a high speed, and have a low voltage alarm function to not waste the battery life. These characteristics of the devices are seen as benefits in comparison to current ambulatory ECG monitoring equipment such as the Holter monitor.|$|R
