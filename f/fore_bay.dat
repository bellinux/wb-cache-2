50|$|The Island Falls power dam {{spanned the}} main river channel at Big Eddy Falls, {{where there was}} a drop of 56 ft. In addition, a number of earthen dams were built along the margin of the head pond (<b>fore</b> <b>bay)</b> to prevent overflow. About one mile (1.6 km) south, a 900-foot (275 m) {{concrete}} spillway dam known as “A-dam” was built across a low area on dry land later to be flooded. The <b>fore</b> <b>bay</b> was filled during July 1930, completely submerging the three low falls from which Island Falls gets its name. In August 1930, A-dam was opened and the massive flood of escaping water flushed out a second channel, thus creating an island. The stretch of river affected by the Island Falls development extends from Big Eddy Falls, where the power plant is located, to Mussena Rapids, a distance of approximately thirteen miles (20 km).|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{flow pattern}} in the <b>fore</b> <b>bay</b> and sump of large urban side inflow pumping station is worse which causes machine vibration, lower {{efficiency}} and other server problems. According to pumping station features, some engineering measures can improve effectively the intake flow patterns in the <b>fore</b> <b>bay</b> and the inlet conditions of pumps. In this paper, {{the reasons for the}} bad flow pattern are analyzed on the basis of model test of the <b>fore</b> <b>bay</b> of Wuhaogou pumping station of Qingcaosha water resource project which is the major security project of Shanghai World Expo 2010. The methods were discussed to the inlet flow patterns and the influence of the inlet flow patterns, and the measures which are multi-water distribution holes and bottom sill and guide piers were put forward to ameliorate the flow {{pattern in the}} paper. The model test results showed that the measures were valuable in ameliorating flow patterns and the inlet conditions of pumps. The engineering measures to improve the flow pattern in the <b>fore</b> <b>bay</b> are developed by the consideration of the analysis results and the features of pumping station layout...|$|E
50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was completely}} redesigned by Canadair, {{going from the}} pressure cabin of the Britannia to an unpressurised one with bomb <b>bays</b> <b>fore</b> and aft of the wings. The powerplant was also changed from the Bristol Proteus turboprop engines to Wright R-3350 compound (piston) engines, which had lower fuel consumption necessary for extended missions at low level. At the design stage the other possible engine was the Napier Nomad, another turbo compound engine, although the Nomad was later cancelled.|$|R

He used materials carefully, with bands of differing textures and materials emphasising the horizontal plain, breaking up the massive warehouse like volume of the building. The combination of experimentation with volumes, such as cutting the entrance arches out of the eastern facade and materials, the overhanging storeys, projecting eaves and bays demonstrate Prior’s {{interest in}} the play of light and his understanding of shadow.|$|R

40|$|The Central Arizona Project (CAP) is {{designed}} to bring about 1. 9 ML of Colorado River water per year to Maricopa, Pima, and Pinal counties in Arizona. CAP carries water from the Colorado River at Lake Havasu toTucson. The CAP canal system is a 540 km long system of conveyance system aqueducts, tunnels, pumping plants,pipelines and a large reservoir (just north of Phoenix, AZ). Water is pumped uphill from the Colorado River. This study was conducted for the Hayden-Rhodes Aqueduct of the Central Arizona Project (CAP), which starts at the after bay of the Bouse Hill Pumping Plant and extends to the <b>fore</b> <b>bay</b> of the Salt-Gila Pumping Plant, which is {{just south of the}} Salt River, east of Phoenix. Additional pumping plants downstream lift water uphill to Tucson. The canal between adjacent pumping plants defines a canal segment. A sloping lined canal with check structures carries water between power plants. The canal between adjacent check structures defines a canal pool. The Pumping Plants use electric motors to power the pumps. Power outages could cause the canal to overtop at the <b>fore</b> <b>bay</b> of these power plants, since the flow in the canal would not stop with a power outage. The check structures in between the power plants can be closed with battery-operated electric motors. This was intended to contain water within each canal pool, if power is lost. Stopping the pumping plants and closing the check gates causes surge waves in the canal. Some additional freeboard at the downstream end of each canal pool was provided to contain these surge waves. Increases in frictional resistance in the canal have reduced the available canal freeboard from design conditions. This study evaluated the available freeboard in the canal during steady conditions and during unsteady conditions, associated with a power outage. HEC-RAS was used to determine water surface elevations and available freeboard under both steady and unsteady conditions...|$|E
40|$|HDR Engineering, Inc. and its consultant, Normandeau Associates, Inc., {{conducted}} an American Shad Radio Telemetry Study {{in association with}} Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) relicensing of the York Haven Hydroelectric Project (Project). Anadromous fish passage is a key issue for relicensing the run-of-river Project, located on the Susquehanna River in southeast Pennsylvania. Efforts to restore anadromous fish populations and construct passage facilities have occurred at all four lower Susquehanna River hydropower dams since the 1980 s. In the spring of 2012, two release groups, representing 64 total American shad, were collected at the downstream Conowingo Hydroelectric Station west fish lift. The shad were radio-tagged, transported, and released approximately 15 miles upstream of the Project to monitor their downstream passage. Remote monitoring stations were utilized to detect tagged shad as they migrated downstream through the Project, with continuous monitoring of both release groups occurring between April and August 2012. The monitoring stations were positioned at various locations north of the powerhouse <b>fore</b> <b>bay,</b> in the powerhouse <b>fore</b> <b>bay</b> at the sluice gate, and on {{the east and west}} shores of the River downstream of the powerhouse. Five of the 64 tagged shad were not detected passing downstream of the Project after release, resulting in a total of 59 individuals that migrated downstream of the Project. Of these 59 shad, 35. 6 % passed downstream of the Project within two days of release. The majority of fish released in the first group passed through the Project within 13 days of release, while the majority of fish released in the second group passed through the Project within 10 days of release. The Main Dam spillway was most frequently used by shad to pass downstream, followed by passage through the turbines and sluice gate. Overall, 75 % of the 59 adult tagged shad passed downstream of York Haven via preferred (i. e., non-turbine) passage routes and over 80 % of shad that passed through the Project were detected further downstream past Haldeman Island. By employing a scientifically sound, agency-negotiated methodology, the American Shad Radio Telemetry Study successfully documented the timing and route of downstream passage of tagged fish. Results of the study were evaluated, incorporated into licensing documents, and reviewed with resource agencies to help resolve fish passage issues during relicensing...|$|E
40|$|Hydropower {{generation}} {{is a function}} of discharge of the generating units and the difference between the <b>fore</b> <b>bay</b> and tailrace levels of the reservoir, and is subject to penstock head losses and to the generation unit efficiency factor, which in turn {{is a function of}} the reservoir level and reservoir capacity. For this actual plant data from Sewa Hydroelectric Project StageII which is a runofthe river project having installed capacity of 120 MW situated in Jammu region has been used. In this paper two hydro electric models such as reservoir level versus capacity model and head loss versus water discharge rate have been studied which are used for calculating net head and further can be used for online implementation of Availability Based Tariff in which day ahead scheduling is done. In order to accomplish this task, data from plant is employed for training, validating and testing the artificial neural network (ANN) model which provide accurate results. Thereafter with these models, a comparison is made with multiple regression models in terms of their prediction accuracy, mean square error and regression R value.

40|$|Free surface {{vortices}} at intakes {{can cause}} excessive vibration, efficiency loss, structural damage, and flow reduction in hydroturbines, pumps, culverts, etc. They {{can also be}} a safety hazard and a potential loss of life. One of the major problems encountered during intake design is the specification of submergence and other design parameters in order to avoid strong free surf ace vortex formation. A properly conceived model study will determine whether free surface vortices are likely to occur. Before that point, however, the engineer needs to develop a preliminary design and then decide if a model study is needed. In order to assist in preliminary intake design, a plot of dimensionless submergence versus intake Froude number is presented for a number of vertical and horizontal intakes from both field and laboratory observations. The pilot is divided into two regions: 1) a region where intake vortices are unlikely and a model study is not required except with extremely poor approach conditions, and 2) a region with a good possibility of intake vortices, and a model study is recommended. Region 2, where intake vortices are a good possibility, is very large; encompassing many intake facilities. This is because minimum intake submergence to avoid vortex formation is highly dependent upon approach conditions, which are site specific. In order to add some clarity to this limited design criteria, an experimental study was undertaken which focused upon typical intake approach conditions. Most hydropower intakes have a forebay to avoid high circulation near the intake, so the experimental study simulated approach conditions with a <b>fore</b> <b>bay</b> or approach channel of varying length and width. The experiments were limited to vertical be 11 mouth intakes. The tendency for vortex formation is enhanced by separation around {{the leading edge of the}} approach channel walls. A long, narrow forebay will reduce the tendency for vortex formation. LEGISLATIVE COMMISSION ON MINNESOTA RESOURCES STATE OF MINNESOTA St. Paul, Minnesot...|$|E
40|$|The 366 -MW Pelton Round Butte Hydroelectric Project is co-owned by Portland General Electric (PGE) and the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon (CTWSRO). A new 50 year license {{was issued}} in 2005. The project {{consists}} of three generation facilities located on the Deschutes River. The 247 -MW Round Butte Project is the upper most development and impounds a 4, 000 -acre storage reservoir fed by the Deschutes, Metolius, and Crooked River (Lake Billy Chinook), the 100 -MW Pelton Project is located approximately 7 miles downstream of Round Butte Dam and impounds a 540 -acre reservoir known as Lake Symtustus. The 18 -MW Reregulating Project is located approximately 3 miles downstream of Pelton Dam and impounds a 3 mile long, 190 -acre reservoir. When Round Butte Dam was constructed in the early 1960 s, a fish passage system for both downstreamand upstream salmonids was constructed. However, after attempting to maintain anadromous passage, the downstream fish passage system {{was determined to be}} ineffective, due to the inability to capture downstream migrating fish in Lake Billy Chinook. To mitigate for the loss, the Round Butte Fish Hatchery was constructed below the Dam. As part of the new Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) license PGE and the Tribes have committed to reestablishing anadromous fish runs above Round Butte Dam. PGE and CTWSRO re-established downstream passage for anadromous smolts and resident fish species in December of 2009 when the Selective Water Withdrawal structure and associated downstream fish passage, capture, sampling, and transfer facilities became operational. Since then thousands of downstream migrating spring Chinook, summer steelhead, and juvenile Oncorhyncus nerka, (sockeye) have been captured and transported below the project to continue their downstream migration. Beginning in the spring of 2011, adults returning from these efforts have begun to be captured at the Pelton Adult Fish Trap located below the Reregulation Dam. Returning adults began to be transported upstream of Round Butte Dam in 2012. Returning known origin adults are transported from the Pelton Adult fish Trap to the Round Butte Adult Release Facility where they are released into the <b>fore</b> <b>bay</b> of Round Butte Dam to continue their upstream migration...|$|E
