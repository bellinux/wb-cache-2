Only a very small proportion (1–4%) have a clear underlying connective tissue disorder, such as <b>Ehlers–Danlos</b> <b>syndrome</b> type 4 and more rarely Marfan's syndrome. <b>Ehlers-Danlos</b> <b>syndrome</b> type 4, caused by mutations of the COL3A gene, leads to defective production of the collagen, type III, alpha 1 protein and causes skin fragility as well as weakness of the walls of arteries and internal organs. Marfan's syndrome results from mutations in the FBN1 gene, defective production of the protein fibrillin-1, and a number of physical abnormalities including aneurysm of the aortic root.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{purpose of}} the study was to carry out a {{candidate}} gene analysis in families with familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections. MethodsThe study material consisted of 11 Finnish families (with 115 members genotyped) who underwent echocardiographic examination for measurement of the aortic root diameter. Selected candidate genes included the loci for Marfan and <b>Ehlers-Danlos</b> <b>syndromes,</b> the genes of matrix metalloproteinases 3 and 9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 as well two loci on the chromosomes 5 q 13 - 14 and 11 q 23. 2 -q 24, previously found to be linked to the disease. ResultsThe chromosomal locus 5 q 13 - 14 was linked to the disease risk (nonparametric linkage score 3. 0, P =. 005) confirming the previous linkage. Other candidate genes and loci were excluded as major loci in these families. ConclusionsThe identification of the gene at chromosomal location 5 q 13 - 14 causing the development of such diseases would give us important knowledge on the pathogenesis of the disease and enable the identification of subjects at risk. This in turn would lead to appropriate treatment before the occurrence of fatal complications and, likely, to the development of new treatment methods...|$|R
25|$|The {{presence}} of bruises {{may be seen}} in patients with platelet or coagulation disorders, or those who are being treated with an anticoagulant. Unexplained bruising may be a warning sign of child abuse, domestic abuse, or serious medical problems such as leukemia or meningoccocal infection. Unexplained bruising can also indicate internal bleeding or certain types of cancer. Long-term glucocorticoid therapy can cause easy bruising. Bruising present around the navel (belly button) with severe abdominal pain suggests acute pancreatitis. Connective tissue disorders such as <b>Ehlers-Danlos</b> <b>syndrome</b> may cause relatively easy or spontaneous bruising depending on the severity.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} the cause of aortic insufficiency, is often due to the aortic root {{dilation}} (annuloaortic ectasia), which is idiopathic in over 80% of cases, but otherwise may result from aging, syphilitic aortitis, osteogenesis imperfecta, aortic dissection, Behçet's disease, reactive arthritis and systemic hypertension. Aortic root dilation {{is the most common}} cause of aortic insufficiency in developed countries. Additionally, aortic insufficiency has been linked to the use of some medications, specifically medications containing fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine isomers and dopamine agonists. Other potential causes that affect the valve directly include Marfan syndrome, <b>Ehlers–Danlos</b> <b>syndrome,</b> ankylosing spondylitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. In acute cases of aortic insufficiency, the main causes are infective endocarditis, aortic dissection or trauma.|$|E

40|$|<b>Ehlers-Danlos</b> <b>{{syndrome}}s</b> (EDS) and Marfan syndrome (MFS) are multisystemic disorders that primarily {{affect the}} soft connective tissues. Both disorders {{have benefited from}} recent advances in clinical and molecular characterization, allowing improvements in clinical diagnosis and management. EDS are a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by skin hyperextensibility, atrophic scarring, joint hypermobility and generalized tissue fragility. The current classification proposes six subtypes based on clinical, biochemical and molecular characteristics. However, examples of unclassified variants and 'overlap phenotypes' are becoming more common. Mutations in genes encoding fibrillar collagens or collagen-modifying enzymes {{have been identified in}} most forms of EDS, including the classic and vascular subtypes (collagen type V and III, respectively), and the rare arthrochalasis, kyphoscoliosis and dermatosparaxis variants (type I collagen defects). To date, the genetic background of the hypermobility type of EDS remains unclear, although some new insights have been gained recently. MFS is an autosomal-dominant disorder that affects the cardiovascular, ocular and skeletal system with aortic root dilation/dissection, ectopia lentis and bone overgrowth, respectively. Advances in therapeutic, mainly surgical, techniques have improved median survival significantly, yet severe morbidity and a substantial risk for premature mortality remain associated. The disorder is caused by mutations in the FBN 1 gene, encoding the microfibrillar protein fibrillin- 1.

40|$|The <b>Ehlers-Danlos</b> <b>syndromes</b> (EDS) are complicated, {{multisystemic}} disorders {{that can}} impact almost {{every aspect of}} an individual’s life and severely affect functioning. Research into optimal long-term management of EDS is still sparse and recommended medical treatments are largely based upon the clinical opinions of healthcare providers. Social support is linked to coping with adversities such as chronic health conditions, and has a relationship with health-related quality of life. This qualitative study examined the role of support in optimal management of EDS. Five participants with EDS were interviewed, and thematic analysis was carried out. Four themes relating to disparate sources of support emerged: community incorporated personal or face-to-face support (e. g. spouse, family, friends, and peers). Medical support included specific professionals and types of care available to people with EDS. The role of self-support included and focused on resilience and how support helps development of resilience. The {{results of this study suggest}} that external support can facilitate the development of resilient behaviours and attitudes in individuals with EDS, which enable better management of their condition. Interventions that incorporate appropriate, multidisciplinary, medical care with the goals of improving individuals’ access to support, such as information and peer support, could enable better management of EDS. Optimal management of EDS is likely to result in better HrQoL and reduce healthcare-related expenditure associated with treatment of EDS...|$|R
25|$|AAAs occur most {{commonly}} in those over 50 years old, in men, and {{among those with}} a family history. Additional risk factors include smoking, high blood pressure, and other heart or blood vessel diseases. Genetic conditions with an increased risk include Marfan syndrome and <b>Ehlers-Danlos</b> <b>syndrome.</b> AAAs {{are the most common}} form of aortic aneurysm. About 85% occur below the kidneys with the rest either at the level of or above the kidneys. In the United States, screening with ultrasound is recommended for males between 65 and 75 years of age with a history of smoking. In the United Kingdom, screening all men over 65 is recommended. Once an aneurysm is found, further ultrasounds are typically done on a regular basis.|$|E
25|$|Genetic {{influence}}s: The {{influence of}} genetic factors is high. AAA is {{four to six}} times more common in male siblings of known patients, with a risk of 20-30%. The high familial prevalence rate is most notable in male individuals. There are many hypotheses about the exact genetic disorder that could cause higher incidence of AAA among male members of the affected families. Some presumed that the influence of alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency could be crucial, while other experimental works favored the hypothesis of X-linked mutation, which would explain the lower incidence in heterozygous females. Other hypotheses of genetic causes have also been formulated. Connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and <b>Ehlers-Danlos</b> <b>syndrome,</b> have also been strongly associated with AAA. Both relapsing polychondritis and pseudoxanthoma elasticum may cause abdominal aortic aneurysm.|$|E
25|$|Quinolones are {{contraindicated}} if {{a patient}} has epilepsy, <b>Ehlers-Danlos</b> <b>Syndrome,</b> QT prolongation, pre-existing CNS lesions, or CNS inflammation, or the patient has suffered a stroke.

However, one meta-analysis looking at the outcome of pregnancies involving quinolone use in the first trimester found no increased risk of malformations. They are also contraindicated in children due to the risks of damage to the musculoskeletal system. Their use in children is not absolutely contraindicated, however. For certain severe infections where other antibiotics are not an option, their use can be justified. Quinolones should also not be given to people with a known hypersensitivity to the drug class.|$|E
40|$|Gastrointestinal {{involvement}} {{is a well}} known complication of <b>Ehlers-Danlos</b> <b>syndromes</b> (EDSs), mainly in form of abdominal emergencies due to intestinal/abdominal vessels rupture in vascular EDS. In the last decade, {{a growing number of}} works investigated the relationship between a wide spectrum of chronic gastrointestinal complaints and various EDS forms, among which the hypermobility type (a. k. a. joint hypermobility syndrome; JHS/EDS-HT) was the most studied. The emerging findings depict a major role for gastrointestinal involvement in the health status and, consequently, management of JHS/EDS-HT patients. Nevertheless, fragmentation of knowledge limits its impact on practice within the boundaries of highly specialized clinics. In this paper, literature review on gastrointestinal manifestations in JHS/EDS-HT was carried out and identified papers categorized as (i) case-control/cohort studies associating (apparently non-syndromic) joint hypermobility and gastrointestinal involvement, (ii) case-control/cohort studies associating JHS/EDS-HT and gastrointestinal involvement, (iii) case reports/series on various gastrointestinal complications in (presumed) JHS/EDS-HT, and (iv) studies reporting gastrointestinal features in heterogeneous EDS patients' cohorts. Gastrointestinal manifestations of JHS/EDS-HT were organized and discussed in two categories, including structural anomalies (i. e., abdominal/diaphragmatic hernias, internal organ/pelvic prolapses, intestinal intussusceptions) and functional features (i. e., dysphagia, gastro-esophageal reflux, dyspepsia, recurrent abdominal pain, constipation/diarrhea), with emphasis on practice and future implications.

40|$|The <b>Ehlers-Danlos</b> <b>syndromes</b> (ED-S) are a {{group of}} {{connective}} tissue diseases which occur in humans and other mammals. Mink inherit an autosomal dominant form of ED-S which is characterized by laxity and decreased tensile strength of the skin. We wish to report some of the biochemical changes in the skin of affected mink as compared to age-matched, nonaffected mink. There was a 39 % increase in acetic acid extractable collagen per wet weight of tissue of the skins of the affected mink. This {{was accompanied by a}} 260 % increase in prolyl hydroxylase specific activity, a 179 % increase in lysyl hydroxylase specific activity, and a 118 % increase in lysyl oxidase specific activity in the skins of affected mink. [3 H 1 -Hydroxyproline formation was increased 133 % when skin tissue minces were incubated with [3 H]-proline. This was accompanied by a 77 % increase of [3 H]-proline incorporation into protein and a 93 % increase of [14 C]-glycine incorporation into protein. Noncollagen protein synthesis, evaluated by measuring [3 H]-tryptophane incorporation into protein, revealed a 40 % increase in noncollagen protein synthesis. The increased collagen synthesis rate in the skins of the ED-S affected mink may represent either the absence of the control of collagen metabolism which contributes to the molecular defect of the ED-S in the affected mink, or a response to the damaged skin caused by the ED-S in the affected mink, or both...|$|R
40|$|While the {{majority}} of this session will deal with selected inherited vascular abnormalities that may manifest as a haemorrhagic disorder, the initial discussion by Dr Key {{will focus on the}} interplay between the vessel wall and components of the coagulation system, with a focus on haemophilia A and B. Although it is generally accepted that physiological haemostasis is triggered by contact of blood with tissue factor (TF), there remains some controversy regarding the cellular origin of TF in vivo. In addition, the initiation and propagation of thrombin generation are highly dependent on the balance of pro- and anticoagulant functions of endothelium, a profile that varies significantly throughout the vasculature. Drs De Paepe and Malfait address heritable collagen disorders such as the <b>Ehlers-Danlos</b> <b>syndromes</b> (EDS), a heterogeneous group of diseases involving the skin, ligaments and joints, blood vessels and internal organs. Most EDS subtypes are caused by mutations in genes encoding fibrillar collagens, or in genes coding for enzymes involved in posttranslational modifications of collagens. Accurate biochemical and molecular testing is now available for most EDS subtypes and can direct genetic counselling and medical management for these disorders. Dr Shovlin reviews recent developments in hereditary haemorrhagic telengiectasia (HHT), a frequently undiagnosed disorder characterized by arteriovenous malformations in multiple organs.
