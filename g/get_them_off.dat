5|$|On 3October Speedy, while sailing {{once again}} off Gibraltar, spotted ten small ships {{coming out of}} Algeciras, gunboats {{apparently}} attempting to attack a British convoy that was then passing. Brenton identified the ships as merchantmen, attempting to evade the British at Gibraltar in the bad weather. On Speedys approach, they scattered, four sheltering under a fort. Speedy approached and fired on them, causing their crews to abandon their ships. They were driven ashore by the wind, and despite sending boats out, {{it was impossible to}} <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>off,</b> so they were left to be reduced to wrecks. Three days later, Speedy was standing off Europa Point when twelve gunboats were sighted coming out of Algeciras to attack two merchant ships making their way past Gibraltar. One, the Unity, was carrying wine and spirits for the fleet. Their combined firepower far outweighed that of Speedy, but Brenton turned his ship towards them, covering the escape of one of the merchantmen with his fire. The gunboats were attempting to catch the Unity when Brenton took his ship through the flotilla, close enough to break many of their oars, maintaining a constant fire from his guns and with every spare member of the crew firing muskets. The Spanish flotilla broke and fled. Speedy suffered two men killed and one wounded, and sustained considerable damage to her rigging and below her waterline. She was unable to return to Gibraltar in the rising wind, and was forced to run along the coast to Tétouan Bay, where her shot-holes were plugged to allow her to make her way back. During the engagement with the gunboats, the guns in the fortress of Gibraltar had not fired in support of Speedy. When Brenton asked why, the Governor of Gibraltar, General Charles O'Hara, replied that he had arranged with the Governor of Algeciras for the guns never to be fired at the gunboats so as not to annoy the inhabitants of the town.|$|E
25|$|Proceedings {{start at}} around 3pm with the {{throwing}} of twelve Sack Hoods. These are rolled hessian sacks sewn up {{to prevent them}} unrolling. This is a prequel to the main game, mainly for children. The youngsters in the crowd run for them when thrown and attempt to <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>off</b> the field. If they are tackled then they must immediately {{throw it in the}} air unless the challenger is a Boggin in which case the hood is ‘boggined’ and it is returned to the Lord who starts it off again.|$|E

500|$|Cochrane {{returned}} to the coast off Barcelona in June1801, and joined the 16-gun [...] in attacking a Spanish convoy of 12 merchant ships and 5 armed vessels anchored under the guns of a large tower. After a sharp action fought between the afternoon of 9June and the morning of 10June, the two ships sank or drove ashore all of the ships {{with the exception of}} three brigs, which they captured. Three weeks later he was cruising off Alicante when he encountered several merchant vessels, which ran ashore. Rather than wasting time trying to <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>off,</b> he burnt them, but in doing so attracted the attention of a foe vastly more powerful than the Gamo.|$|E
500|$|The {{programme}} led to {{some political}} debate {{on the issue of}} welfare. Speaking in the House of Commons on 13 January, Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, suggested the programme justified the changes being made by the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government's Welfare Reform Act. The following week, Duncan Smith gave a speech to mark the tenth anniversary of his Centre for Social Justice in which he said that areas of the country were being ghettoised by long-term unemployment and had remained largely hidden from the rest of society. Conservative MP Simon Hart raised the subject of Benefits Street at Prime Minister's Questions on 15 January, saying that a street of the type seen in the series existed [...] "in every constituency in the land". Prime Minister and Conservative leader David Cameron responded that the government should [...] "intervene in people's lives" [...] to <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>off</b> benefits and into employment. After declining an invitation to visit James Turner Street, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said that he believed both left- and right-wing arguments on welfare were wrong. [...] "We want a welfare system which is compassionate." [...] Shortly after Clegg's comments, Birmingham councillor Desmond Jaddoo told the Birmingham Mail that he had compiled letters to Clegg, Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband on behalf of some James Turner Street residents inviting them to visit the street and asking for help to find employment.|$|E
500|$|Parcells instituted {{numerous}} changes {{before the}} 1984 season. He changed {{half of the}} roster, getting rid of players he deemed problematic, overhauled the team's strength training program, and trained the players harder {{to make them more}} resistant to injury. The Giants had a problem with player abusing drugs in the early 1980s, and Parcells decided he had to take a stand. He estimates that he released 20–30 players due to drug use in his first three years as head coach, some after giving them second chances. He would often call their mothers to tell them of the players habits in an attempt to <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>off</b> drugs, and several times he recounts crying along with players as he released them. Simms won the starting job back for the season, and Brunner was released. Parcells announced the decision by saying, [...] "e gives us our best chance to win right now." [...] Simms responded by throwing for 4,044 yards, making him the first Giant to reach 4,000yards passing in a season. The Giants had a resurgent season, highlighted by a midseason stretch where they won five of six against opponents such as the defending conference champion Redskins, the Dallas Cowboys and their new co–tenants at Giants Stadium, the Jets. With two games left the Giants had a 9–5 record and a chance to win their first divisional title in 21 years. Yet {{despite the fact that they}} lost those final two games to finish 9–7, the Giants still made the playoffs as a Wild Card. In the first round, they defeated the Los Angeles Rams 16-13 in Anaheim before losing, 21–10, to the eventual Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers. Standout performers included Rob Carpenter and Joe Morris, who split running back duties, combining for over 1,300yards and 11 touchdowns. Four receivers had over 30 catches on the year, including tight end Zeke Mowatt and receiver Bobby Johnson who tied for the team lead with 48 catches each. Phil McConkey returned punts and kickoffs. Parcells installed five new starters on defense, including Leonard Marshall at defensive end and Jim Burt at nose tackle, and the team's first round pick was used to draft Michigan State linebacker Carl Banks, who would become a key member of the Giants' linebacking corps for the next several seasons.|$|E

2500|$|Since then, Coleman {{has been}} one of the most vocal critics of Nifong's {{handling}} of the case. In an interview with 60 Minutes, Coleman argued that he pandered to the black community in the middle of the election campaign: [...] "I think that he pandered to the community by saying 'I'm gonna go out there and defend your interests in seeing that these hooligans who committed the crime are prosecuted. I'm not gonna let their fathers, with all of their money, buy, you know, big-time lawyers and <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>off.</b> I'm doing this for you.'" [...] Furthermore, Coleman stated that Nifong has committed serious prosecutorial misconduct, and if there was a conviction, there [...] "would be a basis to have the conviction overturned based on his conduct." ...|$|E

2500|$|UK band, Deep Purple {{went home}} with $60,000 (2013:$382,202), while most local groups went home empty handed. AC/DC {{allegedly}} refused to play after Deep Purple roadies provoked a fistfight with them. According to Deep Purple's lead vocalist, David Coverdale, [...] "Apparently, a young Aussie band had jumped onstage, plugged into our gear and started playing! Well, all hell broke loose, from what I was told. Our roadies (big buggers to a man) wrestled with the young band to <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>off</b> our equipment and off the stage. Chaos and frolics ensued". Jim Keays performed his solo concept album The Boy from the Stars. Keays and his band were reportedly the only act to have been paid for their appearance, having arranged an outside sponsorship. Later in the year, Deep Purple planned a tour for 1976 and after the Australian Musicians Union [...] "made it clear ... that the proposed tour of Deep Purple could lead to considerable unrest" [...] the UK band placed money into a fund so that artists appearing at Sunbury '75 were paid the full musician's rate.|$|E
2500|$|Journalist Hugh Aynesworth {{and others}} {{investigated}} for articles {{that appeared in}} The Dallas Times Herald. They calculated that Lucas {{would have had to}} use his 13-year-old Ford station wagon to cover 11,000 miles in one month to have committed the crimes police attributed to him. After the story appeared in April 1985 and revealed the flawed methods of the Lucas Task Force, law enforcement opinion began to turn against the claims that crimes had been solved. [...] The bulk of the Lucas Report was devoted to a detailed timeline of Lucas's claimed murders. The report compared Lucas's claims to reliable, verifiable sources for his whereabouts; the results often contradicted his confessions, and thus cast doubt on most of the crimes in which he was implicated. Attorney General Jim Mattox wrote that [...] "when Lucas was confessing to hundreds of murders, those with custody of Lucas did nothing {{to bring an end to}} this hoax" [...] and [...] "We have found information that would lead us to believe that some officials 'cleared cases' just to <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>off</b> the books".|$|E
