500|$|In the {{following}} season, Hextall remained with Hershey, appearing in 53games during [...] the 1985–86 season. He recorded 30wins {{and the lowest}} GAA average of his career to that point, 3.41. The Bears finished the regular season as league leaders, and won the John D. Chick Trophy as the South Division Champions. Hextall lived up to his aggressive reputation in the Conference final, played against the St. Catharines Saints, fighting three different members of the opposition side during a single bench-clearing brawl. The Bears advanced to the Calder Cup final, having beaten the New Haven Nighthawks 4–1 and the St.Catharines Saints 4–3. In the final, they faced the Adirondack Red Wings, who won the championship by four games to two. Hextall played 13games in the playoffs, of which his team won five, and his GAA was3.23. He was named as the Dudley [...] "Red" [...] Garrett Memorial Award winner, as the AHL's outstanding rookie player. Looking back on {{his time in the}} AHL, Hextall reflected that despite his initial disappointment at not being selected to play for the Flyers straight away, [...] "the two years that I spent in the American League got me to the point where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> could be a No.1 goaltender at the NHL level." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the book}} was written, Tripathi felt {{that it would be}} {{difficult}} for him to get a big publication house to publish his novel. The manuscript for The Immortals of Meluha got rejected by 35 to 40 publication houses. Hence, he decided to apply his management skills and promote his book. The Immortals of Meluha—originally titled Shiva: The Man, The Legend—was finally released by Tripathi’s literary agent Anuj Bahri, the owner of the landmark BahriSons Booksellers in Khan Market, New Delhi. Tripathi explained with Daily News and Analysis, [...] "I would be lying if I said that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> would get a big publisher for my first novel. I was a finance guy and a staunch believer in digital marketing that has a better reach in the books market. It actually puts up a conversation rather than a two-minute wire on the same." [...] Together with his friends, Tripathi launched his promotion of the book on the internet. He put up the entire first chapter of The Immortals of Meluha as a digital download from his website, so that the readers would get interested. With the help of his musician friend Taufiq Qureshi, he launched a live-action trailer film on YouTube and built an online community in Facebook and Twitter, surrounding the video, to further hold the reader's interest.|$|E

6000|$|... "Other {{people have}} said so, sir; but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> can't [illegible words] <b>be</b> like her a bit. Mother is so pretty, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{not the least bit}} in the world; and I don't think it's nice for a boy to be like a woman." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, now;--that's {{just what}} I wanted to know. One couldn't write and ask such a question; but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> should {{find out if}} I came." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That's great luck,' I said, 'but I {{have an idea}} he {{is always}} in luck. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> should have to offer him the second berth in my room.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What was it {{you said}} yourself? <b>Sure!</b> Of course <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> quite <b>sure.</b> <b>I</b> do not love him. Did I not {{tell you that there}} could be no doubt after what you said?" ...|$|R
60|$|Duke. Are {{the very}} same with yours. Now <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> know you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, me," [...] said Miss Rangely cheerfully and ungrammatically. [...] "You didn't expect it, did you? <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> {{had seen}} you before--only it wasn't you but your photograph." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's great luck," [...] I said, [...] "but I've an idea he's {{always in}} luck. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> {{should have to}} offer him the second berth in my room." ...|$|E
60|$|However, this {{confession}} of Aunt Emma's rendered one thing more certain {{to me than}} ever before. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> {{was on the right}} track now, after Courtenay Ivor. The bicycle clinched the proof.|$|E

60|$|LADY. Nonsense. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{not a bit}} English. The English are a very stupid people.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was going}} to run away, for I shouldn't like to mix myself up in your affair--it's {{certainly}} a very strange one--unless <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> could help you. But if you think I can--" ...|$|E
6000|$|She turned around, {{apparently}} reassured. [...] "You are not {{to think}} that I have been told anything," [...] she said; [...] "I have only guessed. But when I looked at you, as you came in, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> had guessed aright." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, God, if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> were to die to-night I would repent at once." [...] It is the commonest {{prayer in}} all languages, but {{down on her}} knees slipped Elspeth again, and Tommy, who felt that it had done him good, said indignantly: [...] "Surely that is religion. What?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not that I ken of," [...] {{said the}} king, in the {{paroxysm}} of his apprehension, (which, by the way, might be pardoned {{in one of}} so timorous a temper, and who, in his time, {{had been exposed to}} so many strange attempts)--"Not that I ken of--but search him--search him. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> saw fire-arms under his cloak. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> smelled powder--I <b>am</b> dooms <b>sure</b> of that." ...|$|R

60|$|I replied <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> did {{not wish}} to be the cause of any. It seemed to me, however, that the Heer Pereira wished to make a mock of me and to bring it home to me what a poor {{creature}} I was compared to himself--I a mere sick boy who was worth nothing.|$|E
60|$|Never for {{one moment}} did I doubt me of this truth. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>I</b> was sure. It did not even need, while she turned to whisper {{something}} to her companion, that the cloak she wore should open a little, revealing on her breast a necklace of emerald beetles separated by inlaid shells of pale and ancient gold.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{when the}} {{examination}} came, I thought I could do nothing--it {{was just as}} if I {{had never had a}} brush or pencil in my hand. But the second day a professor in passing me said, 'Good! Quite good!' That gave me courage. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> had failed though; but I was second out of sixty." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{caused him}} embarrassment enough as it <b>was,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>I</b> never saw such faltering, such confusion, such amazement and apprehension.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘These {{are both}} friends of yours, Harry?’ said the lady. ‘Delighted, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>I</b> do not {{remember}} to have met Mr. Challoner.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We're {{right after}} all, by Heaven! <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> was right,' said the Lawyer; 'he {{is the very}} image of his father.

Sit down, young gentleman.' ...|$|E
60|$|My mother laughed bitterly; why, at the time, I {{could not}} understand; {{and my father}} flung out of the house. During the many hours that he was away my mother {{remained}} locked in her room, and, stealing sometimes to the door, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> heard her crying; and that she should grieve so at old Teidelmann's death puzzled me.|$|E
6000|$|Somehow he had {{my hands}} in his. How did he ever get them? <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> had them safely tucked out of harm's way behind me.

Will you be my wife, dear?" ...|$|E
60|$|MABEL CHILTERN. I know. And I {{think you}} might have {{mentioned}} it before. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> have given you heaps of opportunities.|$|R
