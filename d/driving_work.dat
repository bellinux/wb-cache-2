The drop in numbers on the Forest may have been a consequence of introducing Arab blood to the breed in the 1870s, resulting in fewer animals suitable for use as pit ponies, or to the increase in the profits from running dairy cattle instead of ponies. The Arab blood may have reduced the ponies' natural landrace hardiness to thrive on the open Forest over winter. Numbers of ponies on the Forest also declined as a result of demand for more refined-looking ponies for riding and <b>driving</b> <b>work</b> prior to the introduction of motor vehicles.

40|$|Introduction Within many industrialized countries, {{the leading}} cause of worker {{fatalities}} and serious injuries can be attributed to road trauma. In non-occupational research, high levels of sensation seeking personality, and specifically thrill and adventure seeking, have been associated with risky <b>driving</b> behaviors. In <b>work</b> <b>driving</b> literature, high organizational safety climate has been associated with reduced risky <b>driving</b> in <b>work</b> drivers. However, the extent that factors such as safety climate and thrill seeking interact in regard to <b>work</b> <b>driving</b> safety remains unclear, and the current research examined this interaction. Methods A total of 1, 011 work drivers from four organizations participated in the research. Surveys were distributed online and hardcopies were sent via mail. The survey included measures of thrill and adventure seeking, safety climate and work-related driving behaviors, as well as questions relating to participant demographics and information about their <b>work</b> <b>driving.</b> Results The results demonstrated that safety climate significantly moderated the effect of thrill and adventure seeking trait on driving errors, driving violations, and driving while fatigued. Conclusion These results suggest that the development of a strong safety climate has the potential to improve <b>work</b> <b>driving</b> safety outcomes by reducing the impact of particular personality traits such as thrill seeking within an organizational context. Practical application To improve <b>work</b> <b>driving</b> safety, organizations and management need to develop strategies to encourage and foster positive <b>work</b> <b>driving</b> safety climate, particularly within work settings that may attract thrill and adventure seeking employees...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The role of {{workplaces}} {{in promoting}} active travel (walking, cycling or using public transport) is relatively unexplored. This study explores {{the potential for}} workplaces to reduce employees' <b>driving</b> to <b>work</b> in order to inform the development of workplace interventions for promoting active travel. Methods An analysis of a cross-sectional survey was conducted using data from parents/guardians whose children participated in the Central Sydney Walk to School Program in inner-west Sydney, Australia. A total of 888 parents/guardians who were employed and worked outside home were included in this analysis. The role of the workplace in regards to active travel was assessed by asking the respondents' level of agreement to eight statements including workplace encouragement of active travel, flexible working hours, public transport availability, convenient parking, shower and change rooms for employees and whether they lived or worked in a safe place. Self-reported main mode of journey to work and demographic data were collected through a self-administrated survey. Binary logistic regression modelling was used to ascertain independent predictors of <b>driving</b> to <b>work.</b> Results Sixty nine per cent of respondents travelled to work by car, and 19 % agreed with the statement, "My workplace encourages its employees to go {{to and from work}} by public transport, cycling and/or walking (active travel). " The survey respondents with a workplace encouraging active travel to work were significantly less likely to drive to work (49 %) than those without this encouragement (73 %) with an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of 0. 41 (95 % CI 0. 23 - 0. 73, P = 0. 002). Having convenient public transport close to the workplace or home was also an important factor that could discourage employees from <b>driving</b> to <b>work</b> with AOR 0. 17 (95 % CI 0. 09 - 0. 31, P Conclusions There is a significant inverse association between the perception of workplace encouragement for active travel and <b>driving</b> to <b>work.</b> Increases in the number of workplaces that encourage their employees to commute to work via active travel could potentially lead to fewer employees <b>driving</b> to <b>work.</b> In order to make active travel more appealing than <b>driving</b> to <b>work,</b> workplace interventions should consider developing supportive workplace policies and environments. </p...|$|R

During this period, numerous Morgan mares may have been brought west and integrated into Texan horse herds, which influenced the development of the American Quarter Horse breed. The Morgan horse also was an ancestor of the Missouri Fox Trotter. By the 1870s, however, longer-legged horses came into fashion, and Morgan horses were crossed with those of other breeds. This resulted in the virtual disappearance of the original style Morgan, although a few remained in isolated areas.|$|E
