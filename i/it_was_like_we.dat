500|$|The {{episode was}} notable for its sheer {{amount of water}} and its lack of bright lighting. Director Rob Bowman noted {{that he did not}} film [...] "{{anything}} for that episode during daylight, or with anything brighter than a flashlight or an emergency lamp in the hallway". [...] Bowman explained that [...] "Agua Mala" [...] was extremely difficult to film because every time a crew or cast member got wet, they [...] "had to stop everything to dry them off". Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny, in particular, were [...] "water-logged" [...] for a majority of the episode's filming. Anderson later joked, [...] "I mean, we got drenched. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> were back in Vancouver!" [...] The show had previously filmed in Vancouver from season one to five before moving to Los Angeles, California, {{at the beginning of the}} sixth season.|$|E
500|$|After {{being dropped}} by Columbia, the band {{set off to}} Brazil to support All Time Low in January 2011. They {{subsequently}} began recording their fifth studio album with producer and longtime friend Ed Ackerson at his studio, Flowers Studio, in Minneapolis. The band recorded on their own time with their own resources, which both provided comfort {{and a sense of}} nervousness to the group. They did not sit down and preconceive the album as a change in style, but rather relaxed and took their time writing it. [...] "We just felt like <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> were just taking our time and just kinda living life and not worrying about too much other than getting together and making music," [...] remarked Taylor. Pierre has since looked back on Go with mixed emotions, citing it as his personal least favorite album by the band. He noted that he was struggling with dark thoughts and felt that the band's collective misery translated to the record.|$|E
2500|$|After [...] "It All Belongs to Me" [...] was {{presented}} to Monica, the singer revealed {{that she wanted to}} record a duet with Brandy, following their first released in 1998. Brandy also had plans to record a new duet with Monica. After talking to RCA and Chameleon Records executives Peter Edge and Breyon Prescott, both singers agreed to record the song. Monica, however, stated that {{she was not going to}} the studio without Clive Davis' permission. Brandy's team then contacted Davis, who authorized the duet. Brandy and Monica then recorded the song together in a recording studio located on Miami, Florida from January 6 to 8, 2012. Brandy said that the energy of the recording sessions was [...] "magical! I was just so excited to see her again, just to work with her again. The session was great. It was like it was meant to be. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> never missed a beat." [...] The singers also took pictures and talked about their current lives. Brandy also revealed that she and Monica wanted to [...] "give [...] best vocals ever on a song." ...|$|E

2500|$|Go was {{recorded}} with producer and longtime friend Ed Ackerson from June to October 2011 at his studio, Flowers Studio, in the band's home of Minneapolis, Minnesota. The band recorded {{on their own}} time with their own resources, which both provided comfort {{and a sense of}} nervous to the group. Typically, for an album such as their previous effort, the band would head to Los Angeles with booked studio time, balancing the schedules of producers, on budget with a set timeline. The band did not sit down and preconceive the album as a change in style, but rather relaxed and took their time writing it. [...] "This time we just felt like <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> were just taking our time and just kinda living life and not worrying about too much other than getting together and making music," [...] remarked Taylor. [...] "Before we would just work on material, make edits, add guitars and then finish.

Kincaid {{plays with}} dichotomies just for us to realize that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not always easy to remember, to accept or to forgive. He cannot write, but Elaine can, and she is his daughter, and Kincaid goes on and on with this simplistic {{reasoning}} that little by little becomes not simple at all. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> remembering everything together with her, bits and pieces of memory that are deep inside.

5000|$|The rat (thought) {{is bigger}} and {{stronger}} than the kitten (awareness)"Generally, when thought arises, the mind will <b>be</b> dragged along <b>like</b> a kitten trying to catch a big rat. The rat (thought) is {{bigger and stronger}} than the kitten (awareness). When the rat shows up, the kitten, by nature, will catch the rat. The rat is frightened and runs away with the kitten holding on. After a while the kitten becomes tired and let the rat go. Similarly, thoughts will arise endlessly and stop by themselves. As we cultivate self-awareness more and more, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>we</b> keep feeding a kitten until it becomes a big, strong cat.

50|$|The biggest {{point of}} {{difference}} between the first record {{and this one is}} the time we took preparing. The preparation time for the first album <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> a couple of years on the road. So <b>we</b> <b>were</b> basically <b>like</b> a garage pop band who went into a studio. Dennis didn't really give us the chance to develop or grow beyond that. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> what <b>we</b> knew went onto the record.

Once we had {{a pretty good idea of}} what everything was going to sound <b>like,</b> <b>we</b> didn't need much time in the studio, because we had spent six months working on the demos.|$|R
5000|$|The {{songs that}} you write when you're young {{are just a}} part of you—they stay with you. The {{interesting}} thing was how far I kind of strayed from the original versions over the years—I mean acoustically and everything. So, coming back and stripping them down and trying to revisit them in a kind of honest, genuine fashion was actually—even for an old cynic like me—it turned to be a very moving thing ...

5000|$|After {{the cast}} had been chosen, Miller and Boyett asked Chris Thompson, {{one of the}} writer-producers of Laverne & Shirley, to write the pilot and be the series showrunner. Thompson (who {{would go on to}} executive-produce such shows as The Larry Sanders Show) said later that he took the job purely for the money, but {{unexpectedly}} found it to be [...] "my completely favorite experience in show business", because the network left him and his young cast free to experiment.

60|$|Relative {{names are}} such as father, son; ruler, subject; like; equal; unlike; unequal; longer, shorter; cause, effect. Their {{characteristic}} property is, {{that they are}} always given in pairs. Every relative name which is predicated of an object, supposes another object (or objects), of which we may predicate either that same name or another relative name which {{is said to be}} the correlative of the former. Thus, when we call any person a son, we suppose other persons who must be called parents. When we call any event a cause, we suppose another event which is an effect. When we say of any distance that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> longer, we suppose another distance which is shorter. When we say of any object that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like,</b> <b>we</b> mean that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> some other object, which is also said to <b>be</b> <b>like</b> the first. In this last case both objects receive the same name; the relative term is its own correlative.|$|R

BYU jumped to a 49-0 lead before Utah scored its first {{touchdown}} just before halftime. Behind quarterback Ty Detmer, BYU would score eight touchdowns on its first eight possessions and amass over 750 yards of total offense during the 70-31 win. Utah would score three touchdowns in the fourth quarter against BYU's reserves. [...] The 101 points the two teams scored is still a series record.|$|E
