500|$|Dickinson {{attended}} {{primary school}} in a two-story building on Pleasant Street. Her education was [...] "ambitiously classical for a Victorian girl". Her father wanted his children well-educated and he followed their progress even while away on business. When Emily was seven, he wrote home, reminding his children to [...] "keep school, and learn, so as to tell me, when <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>home,</b> how many new things you have learned". While Emily consistently described her father in a warm manner, her correspondence suggests {{that her mother was}} regularly cold and aloof. In a letter to a confidante, Emily wrote she [...] "always ran Home to Awe [...] when a child, if anything befell me. He was an awful Mother, but I liked him better than none." ...|$|E
500|$|The second side of {{the album}} begins with [...] "Bloody Mary Morning", with the male narrator {{ordering}} drinks on a flight from Los Angeles, California to Houston, Texas after his wife unexpectedly left him, with [...] "the smog and haze reminding me of how I feel". In [...] "Phases and Stages/No Love Around" [...] he recalls dragging in at sunrise after another night of carousing: [...] "I come home last Saturday morning, <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> and found you gone." [...] In the sad [...] "I Still Can't Believe You're Gone", [...] the man realizes the vast impact on his life of her leaving. [...] "It's Not Supposed to Be That Way" [...] reflects his inability to accept the situation and his grief, but still in a self-centered way. In [...] "Heaven and Hell", the man expresses his ambivalence about living without his wife, with the lyric: [...] "Sometimes it's heaven, sometimes it's hell, and sometimes I don't even know." [...] The final track is [...] "Phases and Stages/Pick Up the Tempo/Phases and Stages", in which the man reveals his inability to change his character, and accepts his nature and its consequences.|$|E
500|$|In the 1980s, {{to further}} {{his career as}} a filmmaker, Pierce moved to Carmel, California, where he met and befriended actor Clint Eastwood. Pierce shared a film {{treatment}} he had developed with Eastwood, who liked the story and helped Pierce develop it into Sudden Impact (1983), the fourth entry in Eastwood's Dirty Harry film series. Pierce was given a writer's credit for the story along with Joseph C. Stinson. Pierce is said to have written the phrase, [...] "Go ahead, make my day," [...] the film's most famous line, which went on to be identified as one of the ten best movie quotes of all-time by the American Film Institute. The phrase was inspired by something his father once told Pierce in his youth while encouraging his son to mow the lawn: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>home</b> tonight and the yard has not been mowed, you're going to make my day." [...] However, whether Pierce truly invented the phrase has been brought into question, since the same line was used in the action-drama film Vice Squad (1982) the previous year. Around this time, Pierce also directed Sacred Ground (1983), which was released the same year as Sudden Impact.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{deploying}} to Iraq Smith {{had written}} to his parents, [...] "There {{are two ways to}} come home, stepping off the plane and being carried off the plane. It doesn't matter how <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>home,</b> because I am prepared to give all that I am to ensure that all my boys make it home." [...] Smith was cremated and his ashes scattered in the Gulf of Mexico, where he loved to fish.
