25|$|For {{children}} and teenagers, charts documenting growth as it compares to other {{children of the}} same age is included, so that <b>health-care</b> <b>providers</b> can follow the child's growth over time. Many diseases and social stresses can affect growth, and longitudinal charting can thus provide a clue to underlying illness. Additionally, a child's behavior (such as timing of talking, walking, etc.) as it compares to other children {{of the same age}} is documented within the medical record for much the same reasons as growth.|$|E
25|$|The FDA has {{classified}} the HPV vaccine as {{a pregnancy}} Category B, meaning {{there is no}} apparent harm to the fetus in animal studies. HPV vaccines have not been causally related with adverse pregnancy outcomes or adverse effects on the fetus. However, data on vaccination during pregnancy is very limited and vaccination during the pregnancy term should be delayed until more information is available. If a woman {{is found to be}} pregnant during the three-dose series of vaccination, the series will be postponed until pregnancy has been completed. While there is no indication for intervention for vaccine dosages administered during pregnancy, patients and <b>health-care</b> <b>providers</b> are encouraged to report exposure to vaccines to the appropriate HPV vaccine pregnancy registry.|$|E
500|$|The Congress {{commissioned}} {{a study of}} VA by the RAND Corporation, which was published early in 2016.

500|$|Franklin {{recommends}} that resistance {{take the form}} of refusing to speak the language of the occupiers. This language includes such terms as stakeholders, users, <b>health-care</b> <b>providers</b> and consumers of education to refer to teachers and students, doctors, nurses, patients and communities. Franklin also calls for resistance through court challenges and [...] "the creative use of electronic media to bypass the occupation forces' control of information." [...] Finally, Franklin is a strong supporter of citizen politics, a civic movement which focuses on practical solutions to common problems—everything from the absence of peace to homelessness and local traffic congestion. Borrowing a Quaker term, Franklin calls on citizens to engage in scrupling, the process of sitting down together to discuss and clarify common moral and political concerns. She writes that citizen politics does not seek to overthrow existing governments but to improve them [...] "whether those in power like it or not." [...] The movement also tries to defend communities against those intent, in Franklin's words, on [...] "turning the globe into one giant commercial resource base, while denying a decent and appropriate habitat to many of the world's citizens." ...|$|E
2500|$|Spock {{advocated}} that infants {{should not}} be placed on their back when sleeping, commenting in his 1958 edition that [...] "if [...] vomits, he's more likely to choke on the vomitus." [...] This advice was extremely influential on <b>health-care</b> <b>providers,</b> with nearly unanimous support through to the 1990s. Later empirical studies, however, found {{that there is a}} significantly increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) associated with infants sleeping on their abdomens. [...] Advocates of evidence-based medicine have used this {{as an example of the}} importance of basing health-care recommendations on statistical evidence, with one researcher estimating that as many as 50,000 infant deaths in Europe, Australia, and the US could have been prevented had this advice been altered by 1970, when such evidence became available.|$|E
2500|$|Emanuel {{said that}} legalizing euthanasia, {{as was done}} in the Netherlands, might be counterproductive, in that it would {{decrease}} support for pain management and mental health care. However, Emanuel does support the use of Medical Directives to allow patients to express their wishes when they can no longer communicate. Ezekiel, and his former wife Linda Emanuel, an M.D. Ph.D. bioethicist and geriatrician, created the Medical Directive, which is described as more specific and extensive than previous living wills and is a third generation Advance Directive. He claims the Hippocratic Oath debunks the theory that opposition to euthanasia is modern. Emanuel said that {{for the vast majority of}} dying patients, [...] "legalizing euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide would be of no benefit. To the contrary, it would be a way of avoiding the complex and arduous efforts required of doctors and other <b>health-care</b> <b>providers</b> to ensure that dying patients receive humane, dignified care." [...] Emanuel said that a historical review of opinions on euthanasia from ancient Greece to now [...] "suggests an association between interest in legalizing euthanasia and moments when Social Darwinism and raw individualism, free markets and wealth accumulation, and limited government are celebrated." ...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, Estonian society {{encourages}} responsible {{parenting and}} the need for family planning is generally considered self-evident. Parents expect to eliminate the risks {{to the health of the}} child to be born, with the <b>health-care</b> <b>provider’s</b> assistance.

While case law addressing issues of wrongful life is absent in Estonia, the article is aimed at providing possible solutions under Estonian law to some of the legally complex problems of the associated cases through analysis of Estonian, German, and US legal literature and case law.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{sought to}} {{identify}} {{factors associated with}} interest in receiving therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among HCV-infected injection drug users (IDUs) in 3 United States cities. METHODS: IDUs aged 18 - 35 years who were HCV-infected and seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus underwent surveys on behaviors, experience, and interest in treatment for HCV infection and readiness to quit drug use. RESULTS: Among treatment-naive IDUs (n= 216), 81. 5 % were interested in treatment for HCV infection, but only 27. 3 % had seen a <b>health-care</b> <b>provider</b> since receiving a diagnosis of HCV infection. Interest in treatment for HCV infection was greater among IDUs with a high perceived threat of progressive liver disease, those with a usual source of care, those without evidence of alcohol dependence, and those with higher readiness scores for quitting drug use. Interest in treatment for HCV infection was 7 -fold higher among IDUs who were told by their <b>health-care</b> <b>provider</b> that they were at risk for cirrhosis or liver cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Improving provider-patient communication and integrating treatments for substance abuse and HCV may increase the proportion of IDUs who initiate treatment for HCV infection...|$|R
