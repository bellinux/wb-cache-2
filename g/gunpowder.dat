5|$|The Arabs {{acquired}} {{knowledge of}} <b>gunpowder</b> {{some time after}} 1240, but before 1280, by which time had written, in Arabic, recipes for <b>gunpowder,</b> instructions for the purification of saltpeter, and descriptions of <b>gunpowder</b> incendiaries.|$|E
5|$|Departing from Cape Henlopen, Delaware on February 17, 1776, {{the fleet}} {{arrived in the}} Bahamas on March 1, with the {{objective}} of seizing <b>gunpowder</b> and munitions known to be stored there. Two days later the marines came ashore seizing Fort Montagu at the eastern end of the Nassau harbor, but did not advance to the town where the <b>gunpowder</b> was stored. That night Nassau's governor had most of the <b>gunpowder</b> loaded aboard ships sailing for St. Augustine. On March 4, the Continental Marines advanced and took control of the poorly defended town.|$|E

5|$|Fire arrow: One of the {{earliest}} weaponized forms of <b>gunpowder</b> was the fire arrow which received {{its name from the}} translated Chinese term huǒjiàn (火箭), which literally means fire arrow. In China a 'fire arrow' referred to a <b>gunpowder</b> projectile consisting of a bag of incendiary <b>gunpowder</b> attached to the shaft of an arrow from the 9th century onward. Later on solid fuel rockets utilizing <b>gunpowder</b> were used to provide arrows with propulsive force and the term fire arrow became synonymous with rockets in the Chinese language. In other languages such as Sanskrit 'fire arrow' (agni astra) underwent a different semantic shift and became synonymous with 'cannon.' Fire arrows are the predecessors of fire lances, the first firearm.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gunpowder</b> weapons {{had begun}} to be {{introduced}} into England in the early 14th century, initially being used as offensive siege weapons but rapidly being adapted for defensive purposes during the 1360s. Although they were expensive, by the 1380s their potential value in defending castles and city walls was well understood and specialised facilities {{had begun to}} be built. Norwich had acquired <b>gunpowder</b> weapons {{and a team of}} gunners by 1355, and by 1385 had fifty <b>gunpowder</b> pieces for use along its city walls. Typically, these would have been small guns called hand cannons, rather than the heavier pieces termed bombards.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its role in protecting the Thames, the fort had various military uses during the 18th century. From 1716 onwards, the Board of Ordnance began {{to use it as}} a <b>gunpowder</b> depot; there were safety restrictions on moving <b>gunpowder</b> in and out of the London docks, so Tilbury was used instead. Two large magazines were built, able to hold 3,600 barrels of powder each, and the old blockhouse and other buildings were converted to act as further magazines. Eventually the fort could hold more than 19,000 barrels of <b>gunpowder.</b> It was also used as a transit depot for soldiers and, after the Jacobite rising of 1745, as a prison to hold 268 Highlander prisoners of war. The Jacobite prisoners were kept in the <b>gunpowder</b> magazines and 45 died from typhus before they were sent on to London for trial.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Gunpowder</b> Incident (or <b>Gunpowder</b> Affair) was a {{conflict}} {{early in the}} American Revolutionary War between Lord Dunmore, the Royal Governor of the Colony of Virginia, and militia led by Patrick Henry. On April 20, 1775, {{one day after the}} Battles of Lexington and Concord (and well before news of that event reached Virginia), Lord Dunmore ordered the removal of the <b>gunpowder</b> from the magazine in Williamsburg, Virginia to a Royal Navy ship.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Gunpowder</b> Plot of 1605, {{in earlier}} centuries {{often called the}} <b>Gunpowder</b> Treason Plot or the Jesuit Treason, was a failed {{assassination}} attempt against King James I of England and VI of Scotland {{by a group of}} provincial English Catholics led by Robert Catesby.|$|E
5|$|The Wujing Zongyaos first {{recorded}} <b>gunpowder</b> formula {{used in these}} bombs held a potassium nitrate level of 55.4% to 55.5%, sulfur content of 19.4% to 26.5%, and carbonaceous content of 23% to 25.2%. The first step for making <b>gunpowder</b> is to powder and mix together sulphur, saltpetre, charcoal, pitch, and dried lacquer. Tung oil, dried plants, and wax are mixed next to create a paste. The paste and powder are combined and carefully stirred. Then the mixture is placed inside a paper container, wrapped up, and tied using hemp twine. Several precautions are taken to prevent the <b>gunpowder</b> from becoming damp.|$|E
5|$|The {{bombs and}} fire lances of the Jin {{were the only}} two weapons of the Jurchens that the Mongols were wary of facing. The Jurchen {{deployment}} of <b>gunpowder</b> was extensive, but it is not certain if the Mongols had acquired <b>gunpowder</b> from the Jurchens before this point. Herbert Franke maintains that <b>gunpowder</b> was in the arsenal of both combatants, but Turnbull believes that only the Jurchens made use of it. The Mongols loaded their catapults with large stones or bombs of <b>gunpowder,</b> which were fired at the Jin fortifications. The barrage inflicted casualties in the city and had a psychological impact on the soldiers operating the Jurchen trebuchets.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} the {{explosion}} was debated in the days immediately following the fire. Public speculation led {{to the arrest of}} Crocker and Warren, the occupants of the warehouse. The Daily-Tribune reported that the explosions could not have occurred without the presence of <b>gunpowder</b> in addition to the saltpeter, and thus they were suspected of possessing <b>gunpowder,</b> which would have led to a murder charge. However, later inquiry released Crocker and Warren of all charges as no evidence of <b>gunpowder</b> was discovered.|$|E
5|$|The {{infantry}} of the Jin {{were armed}} with fire lances. The fire lance was a spear, with {{a tube of}} <b>gunpowder</b> attached to it. The mixture contained, besides the <b>gunpowder</b> ingredients of sulfur, charcoal, and saltpeter, ground porcelain and iron filings. The flame that shot from the lance reached a distance of three meters. The heated tinder that ignited the weapon was stored in a small iron box toted by the Jurchen soldiers in battle. Once the <b>gunpowder</b> was consumed, the fire lance could be wielded like a normal spear, or replenished by a new tube filled with <b>gunpowder.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{programme}} also disproved {{claims that}} some {{deterioration in the}} quality of the <b>gunpowder</b> would have prevented the explosion. A portion of deliberately deteriorated <b>gunpowder,</b> of such low quality as to make it unusable in firearms, when placed in a heap and ignited, still managed to create a large explosion. The impact of even deteriorated <b>gunpowder</b> would have been magnified by its containment in wooden barrels, compensating for the quality of the contents. The compression would have created a cannon effect, with the powder first blowing up {{from the top of the}} barrel before, a millisecond later, blowing out. Calculations showed that Fawkes, who was skilled in the use of <b>gunpowder,</b> had deployed double the amount needed.|$|E
5|$|The years 904–906 saw {{the use of}} {{incendiary}} projectiles called 'flying fires' (fei-huo). Needham (1986) {{argues that}} <b>gunpowder</b> was first used in warfare in China in 919 as a fuse for the ignition of another incendiary, Greek fire. Initially, <b>gunpowder</b> mixtures were utilised through traditional engines and throwing mechanisms; containers and grenades were thrown by mangonels and trebuchets, and explosive rockets and arrows were developed, along with <b>gunpowder</b> flamethrowers.|$|E
5|$|Advancements {{in weapons}} {{technology}} enhanced by <b>gunpowder,</b> including {{the evolution of}} the early flamethrower, explosive grenade, firearm, cannon, and land mine, enabled the Song Chinese to ward off their militant enemies until the Song's ultimate collapse in the late 13th century. The Wujing Zongyao manuscript of 1044 was the first book in history to provide formulas for <b>gunpowder</b> and their specified use in different types of bombs. While engaged in a war with the Mongols, in 1259 the official Li Zengbo wrote in his Kezhai Zagao, Xugaohou that the city of Qingzhou was manufacturing one to two thousand strong iron-cased bomb shells a month, dispatching to Xiangyang and Yingzhou about ten to twenty thousand such bombs at a time. In turn, the invading Mongols employed northern Chinese soldiers and used these same types of <b>gunpowder</b> weapons against the Song. By the 14th century the firearm and cannon could also be found in Europe, India, and the Islamic Middle East, during the early age of <b>gunpowder</b> warfare.|$|E

5|$|Firearms {{remained}} {{in use in}} China throughout the following centuries. Meanwhile, <b>gunpowder</b> and firearms spread elsewhere very quickly. <b>Gunpowder</b> {{seems to have been}} widely known by the 13th century. The Europeans, Arabs, and Koreans all obtained firearms in the 14th century. The Turks, Iranians, and Indians all got firearms no later than the 15th century, in each case directly or indirectly from the Europeans. The Japanese did not acquire firearms until the 16th century, and then from the Portuguese rather than the Chinese.|$|E
5|$|Fireworks: Fireworks first {{appeared}} in China during the Song Dynasty (960–1279), in the early age of <b>gunpowder.</b> The common people in the Song era could purchase simple fireworks from market vendors; these were made of sticks of bamboo packed with <b>gunpowder,</b> although grander displays {{were known to be}} held. Rocket propulsion was soon applied to warfare, and {{by the time of the}} mid 14th century there were many types of rocket launchers available.|$|E
5|$|Following this {{declaration}} by the Dean, {{demolition of}} {{the remains of the}} old cathedral began in 1668. Demolition of the Old Cathedral proved unexpectedly difficult as the stonework had been bonded together by molten lead. Wren initially used the then-new technique of using <b>gunpowder</b> to bring down the surviving stone walls. Like many experimental techniques, the use of <b>gunpowder</b> was not easy to control; several workers were killed and nearby residents complained about noise and damage. Eventually, Wren resorted to using a battering ram instead. Building work on the new cathedral began in June 1675.|$|E
5|$|Fuses: Documented {{evidence}} suggests that the earliest fuses were first used by the Chinese between the 10th and 12th centuries. After the Chinese had invented <b>gunpowder,</b> they began adapting its explosive properties for use in military technology. By 1044 they were using <b>gunpowder</b> in simple grenades, bombs, and flamethrowers, all of which required a fuse to be lit before being thrown at the enemy.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} this initial mishap, De Sotos first capture did not take long, as she and a bluejacket-crewed lugger took {{schooner}} Major Barbour off Isles Dernières, Louisiana on 28 January 1862. Cmdr. Walker's crew discovered 8 barrels of <b>gunpowder</b> and 198 cases of <b>gunpowder,</b> nitrates, sulfur, and percussion caps in the blockade runner. On 8 February, the steamer caught the small schooner Star out of Bayou Lafourche, taking her four-man crew prisoner.|$|E
