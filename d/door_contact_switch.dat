In contrast to most previous methods, we do not pre-specify <b>contact</b> <b>switches,</b> timings, points or gait patterns, but they are a direct outcome of the optimization. Furthermore, we optimize over the entire dynamics of the robot, which enables the optimizer to fully leverage the capabilities of the robot. To illustrate the spectrum of achievable motions, here we show eight different tasks, which would require very different control structures when solved with state-of-the-art methods. Using our trajectory Optimization approach, we are solving each task with a simple, high level cost function and without any changes in the control structure. Furthermore, we fully integrated our approach with the robot's control and estimation framework such that optimization can be run online.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a feedback controller that allows MABEL, a kneed planar bipedal robot with 1 m-long legs, to accommodate terrain that presents large unexpected increases and decreases in height. The robot is provided information on neither where {{the change in}} terrain height occurs, nor by how much. A finite-state machine is designed that manages transitions among controllers for flat-ground walking, steppingup and down, and a trip reflex. If the robot completes a step, the depth of a step-down or height of a step-up can be immediately estimated at impact from the lengths of the legs and the angles of the robot’s joints. The change in height {{can be used to}} invoke a proper control response. On the other hand, if the swing leg impacts an obstacle during a step, or has a premature impact with the ground, a trip reflex is triggered on the basis of specially designed <b>contact</b> <b>switches</b> on the robot’s shins, <b>contact</b> <b>switches</b> on the end of each leg, and the current configuration of the robot.

40|$|Abstract—Six-degree-of-freedom (6 -DOF) haptic {{rendering}} {{for fine}} manipulation in narrow space is a challenging topic because of frequent constraint changes caused by small tool {{movement and the}} requirement to preserve the feel of fine-features of objects. In this paper, we introduce a configuration-based constrained optimization method for solving this rendering problem. The six-dimensional configuration (position and orientation) of the graphic tool {{is defined as the}} solution variable of the optimization problem. Contact constraints are obtained based on identifying principal contacts between the graphic avatar of the haptic tool, called the graphic tool, and the virtual task environment. In order to maintain stability during <b>contact</b> <b>switch,</b> a hybrid method combining collision detection, local search and parallel optimization is introduced. Based on parallel optimization and selection of local solution, we can maintain the local solution of the optimization model. Our method has been validated in experiments of moving a convex tool to probe a narrow cavity with or without bulges. Force rendering is stable even when the free space is very small and involves fine features of objects. Non-penetration between the tool and the object forming the cavity are maintained under frequent <b>contact</b> <b>switches.</b> Update rate of the simulation loop including the optimization and constraint identification is maintained at about 1 kHz.
