40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effect of <b>irrigating</b> fluid temperature on core body temperature changes in patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). A cross sectional study was conducted on 32 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) who underwent TURP at our institution between September 2003 and January 2004. Patients were randomized to one of two groups. Standard group consisted of 16 patients who received room temperature <b>irrigating</b> fluid (± 23. 6 0 C) throughout TURP. Isothermic group consisted of 16 patients whose procedure was performed using warmed <b>irrigating</b> fluid (± 37. 2 0 C). The <b>irrigating</b> fluid used for both groups was aquabidest. The age, resection time, weight of resected prostate, amount of <b>irrigating</b> fluid used, temperature in the operating theatre, core body temperature at beginning and at conclusion of TURP were recorded for each patient. The t test was used for comparison between both groups and a p value of 0. 05 or less was considered significant. The result of this study showed a decrease of core body temperature during TURP, using either room temperature or warmed <b>irrigating</b> fluid (both p = 0. 000). None of the patients in either group demonstrated any criteria of hypothermia. The average decrease of core body temperature in  standard group (0. 99 0 C) was greater than in isothermic group (0. 75 0 C), but it was not significantly different (p  > 0. 05). In conclusion, our study revealed that using either room temperature <b>irrigating</b> fluid or warmed <b>irrigating</b> fluid during TURP could decrease core body temperature at approximately similar level, with no incidence of hypothermia.

5|$|As more {{virgin forest}} {{was lost to}} tavy, {{communities}} increasingly planted and cultivated permanent plots of land. By 600CE, groups of these early settlers had moved inland and begun clearing the forests of the central highlands. Rice was originally dry planted or cultivated in marshy lowland areas, which produced low yields. <b>Irrigated</b> rice paddies were adopted in the highlands around 1600, first in Betsileo country in the southern highlands, then later in the northern highlands of Imerina. By the time terraced paddies emerged in central Madagascar over the next century, the area's original forest cover had largely vanished. In its place were scattered villages ringed with nearby rice paddies and crop fields a day's walk away, surrounded by vast plains of sterile grasses.|$|E

The oral histories of the Merina people, who may have arrived in the central highlands between 600 and 1000 years ago, describe encountering an established population they called the Vazimba. Probably the descendants of an earlier and less technologically advanced Austronesian settlement wave, the Vazimba were assimilated or expelled from the highlands by the Merina kings Andriamanelo, Ralambo and Andrianjaka in the 16th and early 17th centuries.

5|$|Farming in Egypt was {{dependent}} on the cycle of the Nile River. The Egyptians recognized three seasons: Akhet (flooding), Peret (planting), and Shemu (harvesting). The flooding season lasted from June to September, depositing on the river's banks a layer of mineral-rich silt ideal for growing crops. After the floodwaters had receded, the growing season lasted from October to February. Farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields, which were <b>irrigated</b> with ditches and canals. Egypt received little rainfall, so farmers relied on the Nile to water their crops. From March to May, farmers used sickles to harvest their crops, which were then threshed with a flail to separate the straw from the grain. Winnowing removed the chaff from the grain, and the grain was then ground into flour, brewed to make beer, or stored for later use.|$|E
