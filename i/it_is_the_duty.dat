25|$|The {{balance between}} good and evil is {{correlated}} to the idea of purity and pollution. Purity is held to be of the very essence of godliness. Pollution's very point is to destroy purity through the death of a human. In order to adhere to purity <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of Parsis to continue to preserve purity within their body as God created them. A Zoroastrian priest spends his entire life dedicated to following a holy life.|$|E

Additionally, if the widow remarries then her late husband's father-in-law does is not legally bound by this Act anymore as well.|$|E
25|$|In {{the chapter}} about A Folk Tale in My Theatre Life (Mit Teaterliv), Bournonville makes his {{attitude}} {{to the present}} and the past clear: he indicates that our practical and rather unpoetic times (which seem about to precipitate a period of literary and artistic crop failure on the very lands that were once the richest soil of the imagination) art has fallen by the wayside. The poetic past {{has been replaced by a}} 'hypercritical' present, as Bournonville himself writes, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of the artist to restore the spiritual, the poetry.|$|E

25|$|In Colditz, the Wehrmacht {{followed}} the Geneva Convention. Would-be escapees were punished with solitary confinement, {{instead of being}} summarily executed. In principle, the security officers recognized that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of <b>the</b> POWs to try to escape and that their own job was to stop them. Prisoners could even form gentlemen's agreements with the guards, such as not using borrowed tools for escape attempts.|$|R

25|$|According to Twelvers, {{defining}} {{and interpretation of}} Islamic jurisprudence {{is the responsibility of}} Muhammad and the twelve Imams. As the 12th Imam is in occultation, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of clerics to refer to the Islamic literature such as the Quran and hadith and identify legal decisions within the confines of Islamic law to provide means to deal with current issues from an Islamic perspective. In other words, Twelver clerics provide Guardianship of the Islamic Jurisprudence, which was defined by Muhammad and his twelve successors. This process is known as Ijtihad and the clerics are known as Marja, meaning reference. The labels Allamah and Ayatollah are in use for Twelver clerics.|$|E
500|$|The NAACP {{argued that}} nothing would change while {{governors}} like Cruce sought to excuse lynching {{as the product of}} the [...] "uncontrollable passion" [...] of white people.

50|$|During {{the early}} period, ijtihad {{referred}} to the exercise of one's discretionary opinion (ra'y) {{on the basis of}} the knowledge of the precedent (‘ilm). Jurists used ra'y to help reach legal rulings, in cases where the Qur'an and Sunna did not provide clear direction for certain decisions. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of <b>the</b> educated jurists to come to a ruling that would <b>be</b> in <b>the</b> best interest of the Muslim community and promote the public good.|$|R
50|$|Hong Kong is {{a special}} {{administrative}} region of the China, and formerly a British crown colony.

25|$|If a town {{wishes to}} obtain {{the title of a}} city the proper method of {{procedure}} is to address a petition to the King through the Home Office. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of the Home Secretary to submit such petitions to his Majesty and to advise his Majesty to the reply to be returned. It is a well-established principle that the grant of the title is only recommended in the case of towns of the first rank in population, size and importance, and having a distinctive character and identity of their own. At the present day, therefore, it is only rarely and in exceptional circumstances that the title is given.|$|E
25|$|Article 87 of the Basic Law and Article 11 of the Bill of Rights {{provides}} that anyone {{charged with a}} criminal offence shall {{have the right to}} be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law. This presumption is well established under the common law; the much-celebrated case of Woolmington v DPP laid down the basic criminal law principle that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of the prosecution to prove the defendant's guilt subject to the defence of insanity and statutory exceptions. If, at the end of and on the whole of the case, there is a reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant committed the criminal offence in question, the prosecution has not made out the case and the defendant is entitled to an acquittal.|$|E
25|$|The {{husband is}} financially {{responsible}} for the welfare and maintenance of his wife or wives and any children they produce, to include at a minimum, providing a home, food and clothing. In return, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of the wife to safeguard the husband's possessions and protect how wealth is spent. If the wife has wealth in her own capacity she is not obliged to spend it upon the husband or children, as she can own property and assets in her own right, so the husband has no right for her property and assets except by her will. A pre-marital agreement of the financial expectation from the husband is in the mahr, given by him to the wife for her exclusive use, which is included {{as part of his}} financial responsibility.|$|E
500|$|... Jamat-e-Islami (JI), one of Pakistan's leading {{religious}} parties, {{continued to}} oppose any operation in North Waziristan. JI leader Siraj-ul-Haq urged {{the government to}} keep the option of negotiations with the Taliban. He warned that a military operation in North Waziristan would trigger a massive human tragedy, saying that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to consider {{the views of the}} nation and its leadership (inside and outside Parliament) before making a crucial decision affecting national security.|$|R
2500|$|Woods {{states that}} Johnson's religiosity ran deep: [...] "At 15 {{he joined the}} Disciples of Christ, or Christian, church and would forever believe that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of <b>the</b> rich {{to care for the}} poor, the strong to assist the weak, and the educated to speak for the inarticulate."

50|$|Dan Fodio was well-educated in {{classical}} Islamic science, philosophy and theology, {{and became a}} revered religious thinker in his own right. His teacher, Jibril ibn 'Umar, argued that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> and within <b>the</b> power of religious movements to establish the ideal society, free from oppression and vice. Dan Fodio used his influence to secure approval to create a religious community {{in his hometown of}} Degel that would, or so he hoped, be a model town.|$|R
25|$|However, Samuel Richardson and Samuel Johnson both {{reviewed}} and helped out with Lennox's second and most successful novel, The Female Quixote, or, The Adventures of Arabella, and Henry Fielding praised the novel in his Covent Garden Journal. The Female Quixote was quite popular. It was reprinted and packaged {{in a series}} of great novels in 1783, 1799, and 1810. It was translated into German in 1754, French in 1773 and 1801, and Spanish in 1808. The novel formally inverts Don Quixote: as the don mistakes himself for the knightly hero of a Romance, so Arabella mistakes herself for the maiden love of a Romance. While the don thinks it his duty to praise the Platonically pure damsels he meets (such as the farm girl he loves), so Arabella believes it is in her power to kill with a look and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of her lovers to suffer ordeals on her behalf.|$|E
25|$|The Polovtsian army {{returns in}} triumph singing the praise of Khan Gzak (Polovtsian March). Konchak sings of the sack of Putivl and other {{victories}} and confidently predicts {{that they will}} soon capture all of Russia. Igor and his son Vladimir have their worst fears confirmed by the new captives. Vladimir and the other prisoners urge Igor to escape, but he is at first reluctant, singing of his shame and saying that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of the other Russian princes to save the homeland (Igor's Monologue, Mariinsky edition only). Ovlur now arrives {{to say that he}} has prepared horses for Igor and Vladimir and Igor now agrees to escape. The distressed Konchakovna comes, challenging Vladimir to show his love by either taking her with him or by staying. Igor urges his son to come, but Vladimir feels unable to leave Konchakovna who threatens to wake the camp. Eventually Igor flees alone and Konchakovna sounds the alarm. She and her father refuse to let the Polovtsy kill Vladimir. Instead Konchak orders the death of the guards and marries Vladimir to his daughter. As for Igor, Konchak thinks more of him for his escape.|$|E
500|$|The {{validity}} of the [...] "see and avoid" [...] doctrine as a safe means of aircraft navigation was a point of contention between the NTSB and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The NTSB had faulted the doctrine in several earlier collisions, including the 1969 collision of Allegheny Airlines Flight 853 with a privately owned Piper PA-28 and the 1967 collision of Piedmont Airlines Flight 22 with a privately owned Cessna 310. The FAA rebutted these findings and insisted that, regardless of the mode of operation, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of the aircraft pilot {{to be aware of}} any aircraft in his immediate vicinity.|$|E

50|$|After {{the birth}} in <b>the</b> sea, Vaikundar <b>was</b> {{addressed}} by Akilam quite commonly as Narayana. In {{most of the}} teachings of Vaikundar to the people, he portraits himself as incarnation of Narayana. The theological definition from Akilam about Vaikundar too focuses mostly on the same point. The incarnation of Vaikundar in <b>the</b> world <b>is</b> to destroy Kali and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>duty</b> of Narayana to do this. So in that sense <b>the</b> view <b>is</b> stengthened that Vaikundar is Narayana himself.|$|R
