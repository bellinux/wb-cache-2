40|$|This thesis poses a {{question}} for the future of <b>financial</b> <b>districts.</b> Attempting to understand the future evolution of <b>financial</b> <b>districts.</b> It begins by tracing the history of financial speculation and its expressions in architecture and the city. Analysing the New York Stock Exchange and the changes as associated with it in the past 150 years. And how the financial institution has transformed with the introduction of the Electronic Communication Network. The new dispersed identity of the finance, with new diversifications in trading and the slow death of the trading floor. New positions of centrality in the system of finance. Where the Network has created an increased centrality of the system, and the possibility of dispersion also. Working with this duality of the network and analogies which can be built from the geography of the network, as posed by physicists in their current research. Parallels drawn between the nature of the creation of these networks, due to the formation of a new market structure and its new positions, in centralized global cities, edge cities and in the possibilities of locating back offices in other countries. Therefore the new nature of business allows a new understanding of how urbanism must respond to work with the new market structure and create a new interpretation of how the network can be accommodated and understood for future <b>financial</b> <b>districts.</b> by Nomita Sawhney.

5|$|A major Brundage {{investment}} was Chicago's La Salle Hotel, {{which had been}} built in 1908. Located {{in the heart of}} The Loop and the city's <b>financial</b> <b>district,</b> Brundage first leased it in 1940, later purchasing it. When the hotel was seriously damaged by fire in 1946, Brundage spent about $2.5 million remodeling and modernizing it. As Brundage made a home there during his time as IOC president, the hotel became famous in international sports as his residence. He sold the hotel in 1970, but later reclaimed it when the purchaser failed to make required payments.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} two-track connection, tracks ST-1 and ST-2, {{is planned}} between the line toward Lower Manhattan (around 63rd Street) and the IND 63rd Street Line toward Queens using existing bellmouths {{that are at}} 63rd Street and First Avenue. Current plans do not call {{for it to be}} used by regular service, but instead to be used for non-revenue moves, and to provide a connection to the Jamaica Yard maintenance depot. The connection would allow for trains to run from the <b>Financial</b> <b>District</b> to Queens if the capacity of the IND Queens Boulevard Line was increased, or if the Queens Super-Express Bypass was built.|$|E

5|$|Between 1631 and 1890, {{the city}} tripled its area through land {{reclamation}} by filling in marshes, mud flats, and gaps between wharves along the waterfront. The largest reclamation efforts {{took place during}} the 19th century; beginning in 1807, the crown of Beacon Hill was used to fill in a 50-acre (20ha) mill pond that later became the Haymarket Square area. The present-day State House sits atop this lowered Beacon Hill.

5|$|Chicago {{initially}} {{led the way}} in skyscraper design, {{with many}} constructed {{in the center of the}} <b>financial</b> <b>district</b> during the late 1880s and early 1890s. Sometimes termed the products of the Chicago school of architecture, these skyscrapers attempted to balance aesthetic concerns with practical commercial design, producing large, square palazzo-styled buildings hosting shops and restaurants on the ground level and containing rentable offices on the upper floors. In contrast, New York's skyscrapers were frequently narrower towers which, more eclectic in style, were often criticized for their lack of elegance. In 1892, Chicago banned the construction of new skyscrapers taller than , leaving the development of taller buildings to New York.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if a set of twelve financial ratios developed from revenue and expenditure characteristics of Indiana public school corporations in 1998, 1999, and 2000 could forecast a <b>district's</b> <b>financial</b> condition in 2001 and 2002. The study was limited to the statutory general fund which finances a district's day-to-day instructional expenditures. A <b>district's</b> <b>financial</b> status was determined by computing a composite financial status ratio (CFSR) using the district's annual net revenues and expenditures for 2001 and 2002. The relationship of twelve independent variables was examined with the CFSR continuum using multiple linear regression analyses. The population of the study included 286 of the 293 public school corporations in Indiana. The findings of the study found: (1) 94. 4 percent of Indiana's public school corporations were considered non-financially distressed and 5. 6 percent were considered financially distressed; (2) four independent variables were identified as significant and practical predictors of a <b>district's</b> <b>financial</b> condition: annual spending, December 31 st encumbered cash balance, biannual spending, and annual expenditures/ADM ratios; (3) three independent variables were significant; however, the variables were not considered functional predictors of a <b>district's</b> <b>financial</b> condition: personnel/annual expenditure, certified instruction/personnel expenditure, and local property tax/annual revenue; and (4) four independent variables were not significant and were unable to predict a school <b>district's</b> <b>financial</b> condition: December 31 S` net cash balance, employee benefit/annual expenditure, student growth, and school size impact factor ratios. The conclusions indicate: (1) financial ratios can be utilized by administrators to forecast a <b>district's</b> <b>financial</b> condition; (2) several financial ratios capable of forecasting a <b>district's</b> <b>financial</b> condition are under the management control of administrators; (3) financial ratios vary in the period of time they are capable of predicting a <b>district's</b> <b>financial</b> condition; (4) all statistically significant financial ratios may not be consistent predictors of a <b>district's</b> <b>financial</b> condition; (5) not all financial ratios serve as predictors of a <b>district's</b> <b>financial</b> condition even though the ratios provide important financial information; and (6) combined multiple year financial data, in addition to single year data, can be utilized to enhance the model's ability to predict a <b>district's</b> <b>financial</b> condition.

5|$|Geologically, a {{predominant}} {{feature of}} the substrata of Manhattan is that the underlying bedrock base of the island rises considerably closer to the surface near Midtown Manhattan, dips down lower between 29th Street and Canal Street, then rises toward the surface again in Lower Manhattan. It has been widely believed that the depth to bedrock was the primary underlying reason for the clustering of skyscrapers in the Midtown and <b>Financial</b> <b>District</b> areas, and their absence over the intervening territory between these two areas. However, {{research has shown that}} economic factors played a bigger part in the locations of these skyscrapers.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Corbett, an {{entrepreneur}} {{with a background}} in the hotel industry, opened The Slug and Lettuce pub on Islington Green, North London in 1984. At the time, Islington was becoming increasingly gentrified due to its proximity to the City of London <b>financial</b> <b>district.</b> Corbett owned {{a small number of}} pubs, which he rechristened with humorous or nonsensical names, with the effect of differentiating them from competitors. His pubs had the then notable differential of stripped out carpets and enlarged windows so that people could see inside from the street. Corbett listed his business in 1989 as Fast Forward, by which time it was a nine-strong chain. In 1990 Roger Protz identified the group as an imitation of David Bruce's Firkin chain pubs.|$|E
