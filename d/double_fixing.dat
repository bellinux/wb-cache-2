40|$|AbstractThis paper studies routing {{vulnerability}} in loop networks modeled by <b>double</b> <b>fixed</b> step-graphs. A <b>double</b> <b>fixed</b> step-graph has its vertices {{labeled with}} the integers modulo n and each vertex i is {{adjacent to the}} vertices i ± a (modn), i ± b (mod n), where a, b, 1 ⩽ ¦a¦, ¦b¦⩽ n − 1, are different integers. A bidirectional and consistent fault-tolerant routing p of shortest paths is defined by using a geometrical representation that associates to the graph a tile which periodically tessellates the plane. When some faulty elements {{are present in the}} network, we give a method to obtain p-central vertices, which are vertices {{that can be used to}} re-routing any communication affected by the faulty elements. This implies that the diameter of the corresponding surviving route graph is optimum. On the other hand, the set of vertices or edges that can fail, given a p-central vertex, is characterized...|$|R

By this time, Rickman's face had changed from injecting the brain tissue of non-compatible donors and he was now played by another actor, Neil Dickson. In this episode, Rickman's timer broke, leaving him unable to slide. Rickman encountered Quinn's double, the first double of his that Quinn met, and Quinn's double {{was going to kill}} Rickman. Then Rickman told Quinn's double about Quinn and the others. Quinn's double then decided to give Rickman a deal: Quinn's double would not kill Rickman and would fix his timer, and in exchange Rickman would bring Quinn to his double. Rickman did this, so Quinn's <b>double</b> <b>fixed</b> his timer, and Rickman slid. After this, Rickman's timer was counting down like the Sliders timer, indicating that Quinn's <b>double</b> <b>fixed</b> it in the same way Quinn did the original timer.|$|R

On the one hand, we find that air traffic is negatively affected by HSR and air traffic is a strong predictor of tourist arrivals. This suggests a negative indirect effect of HSR on tourist outcomes.

Despite researchers have investigated this issue at length, uncertainty remains about the true contribution of drug adherence in enhancing therapy effectiveness. In this paper, we aim at partly lower this uncertainty by exploiting a unique panel dataset at patient and physician level. In particular, we investigate to which extent the adherence marginal effect is affected by physicians and patients observed and unobserved heterogeneity. Our results show that {{the role of}} drug adherence on health outcomes is significantly crowded out when the model control for both physician- and patient-specific factors. This evidence has important implications for the design of incentive schemes targeted at improving chronic disease management.

Let p<q<n be positive integers such that (q−p) †n and (q−p) |(k 0 n−p) or (q−p) |n (where k 0 =min{k|(q−p) |(kn−p),k= 1, 2, 3,…} and gcd(q,p) = 1.

Background EDT(Electro-Discharge Texturing) roll texturing technique has been firstly developed in Former Soviet Union and the United States in the late 1970 s[1]. It etched roller surface by discharge spark in insulating oil, which could obtain rollers with good reproducibility and uniform roughness, besides, texturing was not restricted by hardness of roller and had high efficiency.

40|$|The {{catalytic}} {{activity in the}} conversion of biomass devolatilization products to syngas of a novel alumina supported Rh–LaCoO 3 catalyst has been investigated in a <b>double</b> <b>fixed</b> bed reactor system. A catalytic screening {{has been carried out}} in order to define the limits of both operation parameters and Rh load to obtain a complete tar conversion associated with the lowest coke deposition taking into account either efficiency or costs of the material. The effect of rhodium load has been investigated in the range 0. 1 – 1 wt. %. The study of the operation parameters has been performed by modifying the reaction temperature (500 – 700 °C), the catalyst amount (0. 25 – 1 g) and the N 2 flow rate (12 – 60 Nl h− 1). The catalyst still provides good performances in tar and light hydrocarbons conversion when the temperature is lowered down to 600 °C. At 700 °C a complete tar conversion can be obtained both reducing the 1 % Rh–LaCoO 3 catalyst amount in the reactor to 0. 5 g and decreasing the Rh load down to 0. 1 wt. %. TPR and DRIFT analyses have been performed to characterize the nature of Rh and to correlate this feature to the catalytic performances. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

The empirical strategy is based on Differences in Differences panel data methods with <b>double</b> <b>fixed</b> effects. Main data is drawn from the Spanish National Statistical Institute (INE) and covers 50 provinces within a time span of 15 years (1998 - 2013). For municipalities we consider a sample of touristic cities (identified by the Spanish National Statistical Institute) and we follow their touristic outcomes with monthly data between 2005 comparing the before and after situation. Our preliminary results indicate that High speed rail accessibility does not promote tourist activity, but offers a negative statistically significant impact on tourism outcomes when evaluated at Province level. Timing effects analysis shows that HSR only provides higher numbers of tourists during the first year, but this is reversed soon {{in the second and third}} year of operation. This result could be explained by the rigid network design not attached to ridership needs that exerts a substitution effect on air transportation, the main mode for long distance tourist mobility. Finally, the analysis of HSR impacts on touristic cities receiving this mode of transportation does not show any distinguishable change after the inauguration of HSR services...|$|R
