50|$|In the {{aerospace}} industry, acoustic chambers {{are the main}} facilities for such tests. A chamber is a reverberant room that creates a <b>diffuse</b> <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> and is composed of an empty volume (from 1 m3 to 2900 m3) and a multifrequency sound generation system.|$|E
50|$|Perception of {{direction}} is greatly {{affected by the}} relative time that a sound arrives at each ear and any difference in the amplitude of a sound at each ear. It is possible to create a sound source having an output characteristic which is rapidly varying with direction and frequency of signal. These kinds of sources create sound fields which are rapidly variable around the listeners room. These are {{often referred to as}} diffuse sources, this is because their output resembles a <b>diffuse</b> <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> â€” a sound field where soundwaves are traveling in all directions with equal probability. In a diffuse field the sound at each of a listeners' ears is so completely different that it is impossible for the brain to work out where the sound has come from. A diffuse source located in front of the listener will be hard to localize and can be used to carry the surround signals.|$|E
5000|$|Sound level meters {{are also}} {{divided into two}} types in [...] "the Atlantic divide". Sound level meters meeting the USA American National Standards Institute (ANSI) {{specifications}} cannot usually meet the corresponding International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) specifications [...] at the same time, as the ANSI standard describes instruments that are calibrated to a randomly incident wave, i.e. a <b>diffuse</b> <b>sound</b> <b>field,</b> while internationally meters are calibrated to a free field wave, that is sound coming from a single direction. Further, USA dosimeters have an exchange rate of level against time where every 5 dB increase in level halves the permitted exposure time; whereas {{in the rest of}} the world a 3 dB increase in level halves the permitted exposure time. The 3 dB doubling method is called the [...] "equal energy" [...] rule and there is no possible way of converting data taken under one rule to be used under the other. Despite these differences, many developing countries refer to both USA and international specifications within one instrument in their national regulations. Because of this, many commercial PSEM have dual channels with 3 and 5 dB doubling, some even having 4 dB for the U.S. Air Force.|$|E
40|$|The {{zones of}} quiet in {{pure-tone}} <b>diffuse</b> <b>sound</b> <b>fields</b> {{have been studied}} extensively in the past, both theoretically and experimentally, with the well-known result of the 10 -dB attenuation extending to about {{a tenth of a}} wavelength. Recent results on the spatial-temporal correlation of broadband <b>diffuse</b> <b>sound</b> <b>fields</b> are used in this study to develop a theoretical framework for predicting the extension of the zones of quiet in broadband <b>diffuse</b> <b>sound</b> <b>fields.</b> This can be used to study the acoustic limitations imposed on local active sound control systems such as an active headrest when controlling broadband noise. Spatial-temporal correlation is first revised, after which derivations of the diffuse field zones of quiet in the near-field and the far-field of the secondary source are presented. The theoretical analysis is supported by simulation examples comparing the zones of quiet for diffuse fields excited by tonal and broadband signals. It is shown that as a first approximation the zone of quiet of a low-pass filtered noise is comparable to that of a pure-tone with a frequency equal to the center frequency of the broadband noise bandwidth...|$|R

This is undesired since many relevant signal types, such as speech, are characterised by considerable temporal variability. This contribution proposes and investigates the use of spatial averaging by means of employing multiple sensors to improve the temporal resolution of the diffuseness parameter.

40|$|The {{acoustic}} performance of passive or active panel structures is usually tested in sound transmission loss facilities. A reverberant sending room, equipped {{with one or}} a number of independent sound sources, is used to generate a <b>diffuse</b> <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> excitation which acts as a disturbance source on the structure under investigation. The spatial correlation and coherence of such a synthesized non-ideal diffuse-sound-field excitation, however, might deviate significantly from the ideal case. This has consequences for the operation of an active feedforward control system which heavily relies on the acquisition of coherent disturbance source information. This work, therefore, evaluates the spatial correlation and coherence of ideal and non-ideal diffuse sound fields and considers the implications {{on the performance of}} a feedforward control system. The system under consideration is an aircraft-typical double panel system, equipped with an active sidewall panel (lining), which is realized in a transmission loss facility. Experimental results for different numbers of sound sources in the reverberation room are compared to simulation results of a comparable generic double panel system excited by an ideal <b>diffuse</b> <b>sound</b> <b>field.</b> It is shown that the number of statistically independent noise sources acting on the primary structure of the double panel system depends not only on the type of <b>diffuse</b> <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> but also on the sample lengths of the processed signals.

40|$|The sound {{transmission}} loss of lightweight structures {{can be increased}} by the application of facing formworks. In the aircraft industry this task is accomplished by means of sidewall panels (linings) mounted on the primary fuselage structure of an aircraft. At low frequencies (< 1000 Hz), however, the {{sound transmission}} loss {{is dominated by the}} so-called mass-law which prescribes an inverse relationship between mass and transmitted sound power. This behavior is worsened by the fact that around the so-called mass-air-mass-resonance-frequency the transmission loss of a double panel structure (e. g., an aircraft fuselage structure with linings) falls below that of a single panel (of equal mass). Furthermore, the effectiveness of passive damping methods is limited due to constraints on mass and volume. On the other hand, the interior acoustics in the aircraft cabin is an important issue regarding passenger comfort, which raises the demand for alternative solutions. Active structural acoustic control (ASAC) provides a lightweight-compliant {{solution to the problem of}} low-frequency sound transmission through single or double panel structures. Prior to wind-tunnel or flight tests, the acoustic performance of active lightweight structures is usually tested in sound transmission loss facilities. A reverberation room, equipped with one or a number of independent sound sources, is used to generate a <b>diffuse</b> <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> excitation. Although it is well-known that the statistical properties of such a non-ideal <b>diffuse</b> <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> will deviate from the ideal case, potential implications on the performance of active feedforward control systems have not been discussed so far. This is why this work evaluates the spatial coherence of ideal and non-ideal diffuse sound fields and considers the implications on feedforward control performance. The system under consideration is an aircraft-typical double panel system, equipped with an active sidewall panel, which is realized in a transmission loss facility. Experimental results for different numbers of sound sources in the reverberation room are compared to simulation results of a generic double panel system excited by an ideal <b>diffuse</b> <b>sound</b> <b>field.</b> It is shown that the number of statistically independent noise sources acting on the primary structure depends not only on the type of <b>diffuse</b> <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> but also on the sample lengths of the processed signals.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{simulation}} of speech sounds {{created by a}} large crowd has produced an unexpected result. The listeners have reported that the auditory events were mainly concentrated {{to the left and}} to right, although the sound sources were equally distributed around the listener. To investigate whether this effect was due to the use of non-individual head-related transfer-functions (HRTFs), a reverberant chamber was used to create a <b>diffuse</b> <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> and a test was performed with 6 listeners. The results of this test have confirmed the previously observed lateral concentration of the auditory events. Being assured that the cause was not on the use of non-individual HRTFs an analysis of the <b>diffuse</b> <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> binaural signals (recorded with a â€˜dummy headâ€™) has followed. The binaural signals were filtered in critical bands and half-wave rectified (modelling processes occurring in the cochlea and in the transduction to neuronal signals) and a normalized cross-correlation function was employed for the lateralization prediction within each critical band. The binaural signal analysis suggests that the key aspect regarding the lateralization dominance of the auditory events is connected to the sections where the cross-correlation coefficient assumes negative values...|$|E
40|$|The {{transmission}} {{coefficient for}} a single plane wave sent through a thin infinite homogeneous isotropic plate separating two fluid media has been derived by Cremer in 1942.

Furthermore, the asymptotical behaviour of the <b>diffuse</b> <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> transmission loss is worked out for both high and low frequencies, generalising Cremer's results with respect to arbitrary maximum incidence angle and general damping. With an adequate expansion a simple analytic estimate for the maximum of the transmission loss and its position has been found. An approximate formula valid for all frequencies is constructed {{on the basis of the}} low- and high-frequency expansions. Analytical approximations for all local extremal values and their positions have been generated by a numerical procedure. Finally generalisations for anisotropic plates and distinct fluid media are described. The combination of the suggested exact method with standard integrators enables safe calculation of the transmission loss of anisotropic plates including third-octave or octave frequency averages...|$|E

40|$|The Wave Based Method (WBM) is used {{to predict}} the {{airborne}} and structure-borne sound insulation of building structures.

These models cannot explain the inter-laboratory differences typically encountered in the lower frequency range. A wave based prediction model has therefore been developed to describe the direct sound transmission through a structure placed between two reverberant rooms.

The comparison has shown that treating the churches as a series of coupled spaces is more valid. However the clarity, C 80, at different receiver positions was found to be either under- or over-estimated by the classical coupled-room model.

The reverberant spatial audio object (RSAO) describes the reverberation in terms of a set of localised, delayed and filtered (early) reflections, together with a late energy envelope modelling the diffuse late decay. The planarity metric, originally developed to evaluate the directionality of reproduced <b>sound</b> <b>fields,</b> is used to analyse a set of multichannel room impulse responses (RIRs) recorded at a microphone array. Planarity describes the spatial compactness of incident sound energy, which tends to decrease as the reflection density and diffuseness of the room response develop over time. Accordingly, planarity complements intensity-based diffuseness estimators, which quantify {{the degree to which the}} <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> at a discrete frequency within a particular time window is due to an impinging coherent plane wave. In this paper, we use planarity as a tool to analyse the <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> in relation to the RSAO parameters. Specifically, we use planarity to estimate two important properties of the <b>sound</b> <b>field.</b> First, as high planarity identifies the most localised reflections along the RIR, we estimate the most planar portions of the RIR, corresponding to the RSAO early reflection model and increasing the likelihood of detecting prominent specular reflections.

In a second experiment, 1 / 3 octave noise stimuli were investigated in a similar manner using variable ICC and two listening positions. The ICC was found to have a large effect on the perceived diffuseness in both experiments and for all frequency bands (125 Hz, 1 kHz and 8 kHz) where correlation between loudspeakers would reduce the perceived diffuseness. Although frequency was found to be a significant factor, the ICC and listener position had larger effects with although moving off-centre only reduced the perceived diffuseness when fewer loudspeakers were used.

It is based on two orthogonally placed particle velocity probes (two Microflowns[1], [2]). The complete signal processing is done in real time with battery powered analogue circuitry, resulting {{in a very small}} and handheld measurement device. One Microflown is used to display the sound level and to listen to the source whilst rejecting the background noise and another Microflown is used to create a stereo indication in which direction the device must be moved to pinpoint the noise source. TECHNICAL PAPER- In complex <b>sound</b> <b>fields,</b> e. g. <b>diffuse</b> <b>sound</b> <b>fields,</b> reflections or many simultaneous radiating sound sources, it is often a difficult task to find specific sound sources with pressure microphones. However, in the near field of sources the use of a Microflown is advantageous over a pressure microphone because of three reasons [3]: 1. The sound pressure level and particle velocity level are of similar magnitude in the free field. Close to an acoustic hard surface, the sound pressure doubles and the particle velocity reduces to zero. Therefore, when a particle velocity sensor such as the Microflown is held close to a hard surface it will not pick up much of the background noise. The sound pressur...|$|R
