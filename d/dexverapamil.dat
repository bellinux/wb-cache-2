40|$|Summary Agents {{capable of}} {{reversing}} P-glycoprotein-associated multidrug resistance have usually failed to enhance chemotherapy activity {{in patients with}} solid tumours. Based on its toxicity profile and experimental potency, <b>dexverapamil,</b> the R-enantiomer of verapamil, {{is considered to be}} promising for clinical use as a chemosensitizer. The purpose of this early phase 11 trial was to evaluate the effects of <b>dexverapamil</b> on epirubicin toxicity, activity and pharmacokinetics in patients with metastatic breast cancer. A two-stage design was applied. Patients first received epirubicin alone at 120 mg m- 2 i. v. over 15 min, repeated every 21 days. Patients with refractory disease continued to receive epirubicin at the same dose and schedule but supplemented with oral <b>dexverapamil</b> 300 mg every 6 h x 13 doses. The Gehan design was applied to the dexverapamil/epirubicin cohort of patients. Thirty-nine patients were entered on study, 25 proceeded to receive epirubicin plus <b>dexverapamil.</b> <b>Dexverapamil</b> did not increase epirubicin toxicity. The dose intensity of epirubicin was similar when used alone or with <b>dexverapamil.</b> In nine intrapatient comparisons, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of epirubicin was significantly reduced by <b>dexverapamil</b> (mean 2968 vs 1901 gg ml- 1 h- 1, P = 0. 02). The mean trough plasma levels of <b>dexverapamil</b> and its major metabolite nor-dexverapamil were 1. 2 and 1. 5 gM respectively. The addition of <b>dexverapamil</b> to epirubicin induced partial responses in 4 of 23 patients evaluable for tumour response (17 %, Cl 5 - 39 %, s. e.,p 0. 079). The remissions lasted 3, 8, 11 and 11 + months. These data suggest that the concept of enhancing chemotherapy activity by adding chemosensitizers may function not only in haematological malignancies but also i...|$|E
40|$|Reversal of drug {{resistance}} offers {{the hope of}} increasing the efficacy of conventional chemotherapy. We tested <b>dexverapamil</b> as a P-glycoprotein antagonist in combination with EPOCH chemotherapy in refractory non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In a cross-over design, <b>dexverapamil</b> was added to EPOCH after disease stabilization or progression occurred. Objective responses were observed in 10 of 41 assessable patients. Biopsies for mdr- 1 were obtained before EPOCH treatment {{and at the time}} of cross-over to <b>dexverapamil.</b> Levels of mdr- 1 were low before EPOCH, but increased fourfold or more in 42 % of patients in whom serial samples were obtained. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed median peak concentrations of <b>dexverapamil</b> and its metabolite...|$|E

40|$|Multidrug {{resistance}} (MDR) in {{a variety}} of human tumours such as renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is thought to be caused by expression of the MDR 1 gene and may be reversed by applying modern chemosensitisers such as <b>dexverapamil,</b> which inhibit the MDR 1 gene product P-glycoprotein. This preliminary report gives information on a clinical study complying with good clinical practice regulations in patients with advanced RCC. The final evaluation is pending. Vinblastine, if anything the most effective chemotherapeutic agent (5 -day continuous regimen), was combined with oral <b>dexverapamil</b> (6 times per day) as a chemosensitiser and dexamethasone to increase <b>dexverapamil</b> tolerance. All patients had histologically proven RCC, which was metastatic and progressive at study entry. The statistical design featured a pre-study regimen of two cycles of vinblastine alone followed by evaluation. If no response was documented, with all patients thus serving as their own control, <b>dexverapamil</b> and dexamethasone were added for three cycles of combination therapy. Having obtained institutional permission from the ethical review committee, we enrolled patients of whom 25 qualified for the combined-treatment arm; 13 patients finished the study, 5 patients failed to complete all treatment cycles (1 because of treatment-related toxicity, 3 for personal reasons, not related to treatment, 1 for tumour-related reasons) and 7 patients were at too early a stage for evaluation. Altogether, 61 % of all patients tolerated a dose of <b>dexverapamil</b> of at least 2400 mg/day with peak serum levels reaching, in some cases, approximately 8 μM (the sum of <b>dexverapamil</b> plus nordexverapamil levels). WHO grade 3 and 4 toxicities were mainly myelosuppression (5 / 18). The combination of 1. 4 mg m- 2 day- 1 vinblastine plus <b>dexverapamil</b> was generally felt to be safe and well tolerated. One partial response and 7 stable diseases were noted in this heavily pretreated study population. Four-hourly administration of <b>dexverapamil</b> in combination with dexamethasone plus escalation to the individually tolerated doses have permitted increases in serum levels of <b>dexverapamil...</b>|$|E
40|$|Multidrug {{resistance}} (MDR) in {{a variety}} of human tumors such as renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is thought to be caused by expression of the mdr 1 gene and may be reversed by applying chemosensitizers such as <b>Dexverapamil</b> that inhibit the mdr 1 gene product P-glycoprotein. On the basis of our preclinical analysis, we inititated a clinical (GCP) study with vinblastine (VBL), the most effective - if at all - chemotherapeutic agent; dexverapamil; and dexamethasone in patients with RCC. All patients had histologically proven RCC that was metastatic and progressive at study entry. The statistical design featured a preliminary study of two cycles of VBL alone followed by tumor evaluation. If no response was documented, with all patients thus serving as their own control, <b>dexverapamil</b> and dexamethasone were added for a minimum of three cycles of combination therapy. Having obtained institutional permission by the ethical review committee (MEC 124, 106 - 1993 / 12), we enrolled 24 patients on this protocol starting on May 3, 1993. In the preliminary study, 1 complete response (CR) was achieved with VBL alone, and myelotoxicity led to an adequate dose reduction from 2 mg/m 2 VBL per day given as a 5 -day continuous infusion (days 1 - 5) in 6 / 10 yet evaluable patients to 1. 4 mg/m 2 per day. In 8 / 11 yet evaluable patients, <b>dexverapamil</b> doses reached ≥ 3000 mg/day by 7 -day oral uptake (days 0 - 6, supported by 20 mg dexamethasone given twice daily), which is significantly higher than those previously reported. The combination of VBL given at 1. 4 mg/m 2 per day plus, <b>dexverapamil</b> given at 3000 mg per day was felt to be safe and well tolerated. Nine patients were yet evaluable for response. One partial response and three minor responses were noted in this heavily pretreated study population. It appears that this innovative approach may have some activity in RCC and may eventually lead to a rational treatment modality. Careful evaluation in ongoing studies is warranted...|$|E
