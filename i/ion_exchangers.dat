Relatively low Gd(+ 3) capacities, {{in the range of}} 0. 01 to 0. 1 millimole per g of <b>ion</b> <b>exchanger</b> were found at room temperature. A significant difference in Gd(+ 3) sorption was observed, depending on whether the <b>ion</b> <b>exchanger</b> was converted from initial conditions of greater or lesser Gd(+ 3) sorption than the specific final conditions.

If the pH of the buffer used for a weak ion exchange column goes out of the capacity range of the matrix, the column will lose its charge distribution and the molecule of interest may be lost. Despite the smaller pH range of weak <b>ion</b> <b>exchangers,</b> they are often used over strong <b>ion</b> <b>exchangers</b> due to their having greater specificity.

A distribution coefficient (K d) at different trace elements for pH value of 4 and at different pH was calculated experimentally. Also the K d of strontium at different shaking times was calculated. Stability of inorganic <b>ion</b> <b>exchanger</b> at different pH was investigated too. The results show that ZrP is almost stability in acid medium, especially with the lower molarity. Also titration shows a that it has high ability of displacement of ions previously attached and loosely incorporated into its structure by oppositely charged ions present in the surrounding solution. In pH value of 4, ZrP is an useful inorganic <b>ion</b> <b>exchanger</b> and shows a high affinity for some elements such as Cs and Sr. The degree of ionization of ZrP depends on acid strength of solution.
