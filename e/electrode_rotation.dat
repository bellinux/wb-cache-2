40|$|An {{electrical}} {{discharge machining}} process with a high <b>electrode</b> <b>rotation</b> speed (EDM-HS) has been developed {{to solve the problems}} of the conventional EDM process in machining metal matrix composites (MMCs). The EDM-HS process employs a non-round tool electrode. The experiment results showed that the materials removal rate (MRR) of the workpiece can be improved significantly by employing a non-round tool electrode. The relationship between the pulse duration, machining current, duty cycle, the rotation speed of the tool electrode and the MRR has been studied respectively. And the machining mechanism of this EDM-HS process has been analyzed both theoretically and experimentally. The results showed that the non-round electrode can enlarge the machining gap and with a high <b>electrode</b> <b>rotation</b> speed, the machined debris can be discharge out of the machining area effectively and hence a stable machining condition can be obtained. As a result, a higher MRR can be achieved. Moreover, an orthogonal analysis has been utilized to study the relative importance of the machining parameters on MRR. It was found that to obtain the highest MRR, the <b>electrode</b> <b>rotation</b> speed was the most influential factor among the duty cycle, machining current, pulse duration and <b>electrode</b> <b>rotation</b> speed. This outcome supports that it is feasible to use this novel method to machining particulate reinforced MMCs, where a higher MRR can be achieved.

In the same experimental conditions, after addition of perchlorate anions (C > 0. 5 mM) in the pyrrole solution the electrooxidation of the monomers leads to the synthesis of a superhydrophilic nanostructured conductive polypyrrole film (network of nanofibers or oriented nanowires, 50 - 120 nm in diameter). The aim of the present paper is to confirm the mechanism that we have previously proposed and so to explain the spontaneous nanostructuration of the electrogenerated polypyrrole films. We have assumed that this templateless formation of nanostructures is notably due to the oxidation of water with production of hydroxyl radicals and nanobubbles of dioxygen. Due to the fact that pyrrole polymerization is associated to the release of protons, we have first verified that the electrode/solution interfacial pH is compatible with the water oxidation potential. For this purpose, during the monomer oxidation the interfacial pH variation has been monitored using a pH electrode having a flat glass membrane which was covered with a Pt grid used as the working electrode. Secondly, {{the presence}} of dioxygen nanobubbles has been indirectly confirmed by rotating the working <b>electrode.</b> Indeed <b>rotation</b> of the <b>electrode</b> allows eliminating the nanobubbles present inside the polypyrrole film.

40|$|Experimental {{studies of}} MHD modes, {{including}} dynamics and stability, using a biased <b>electrode</b> for <b>rotation</b> {{control on the}} High Beta Tokamak –- Extended Pulse (HBT-EP) are presented. When the probe is inserted into {{the edge of the}} plasma and a voltage applied, the rotation of long-wavelength kink instabilities is strongly modified. A large poloidal plasma flow results at the edge, measured with a bi-directional Mach probe with changes in edge kink mode rotation at different biases. This poloidal plasma rotation cannot fully account for the large mode rotation frequency on HBT-EP. By including the electron fluid motion, the mode rotation predictions agree with measurements, indicating that the modes travel with the electron fluid. A GPU-based digital feedback system is used to adjust the probe voltage in real time for controlling both the plasma flow and mode rotation. This active mode rotation control is desirable because it allows for MHD stabilization, as well as studies under conditions of varying mode rotation rates. Mode dynamics were studied using various diagnostics to understand how plasma conditions fluctuate during mode activity and to understand the interaction of the bias probe with the plasma during this activity. Phase-dependent mode behavior was observed, especially at slow mode rotation, which might be attributed to an intrinsic error field or a nonlinear interaction between the bias probe and the mode. Applied resonant magnetic perturbations were used to study the dynamic response of a stable plasma with different mode rotations. At slower rotation, the plasma had a greater response to the perturbations and the plasma reached a saturated response with large perturbations, similar to previous results. At large positive biases, the probe current induces a torque that opposes the natural direction of mode rotation. By applying a sufficiently large torque, a transition is induced into a fast rotation state (both mode and plasma rotation). High poloidal shear flows at the edge were measured in this state, similar to conditions in H-mode plasmas on other devices. The bias required to induce the transition is shown to depend on an applied error field. A technique was established using this transition to determine the natural error field on HBT-EP...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Superthermal E ×B {{rotation}} {{can provide}} magne-tohydrodynamic stability and enhanced confinement to axisym-metric mirrors. However, the rotation speed {{has been limited}} by phenomena at end electrodes. A new prediction is that rotation might instead be produced using a magnetic ripple and alpha particle kinetic energy, in {{an extension of the}} alpha channeling concept. The interaction of alpha particles with the ripple results in visually interesting and practically useful orbits. Index Terms—Magnetic confinement, plasma devices, plasma simulation, plasma waves. AXISYMMETRIC mirrors have many potential advantagesas fusion reactors including high beta, steady-state op-eration, and a simple coil configuration [1]. The major issues that must be overcome by axisymmetric mirrors are magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) stability and excessive parallel energy loss. Both of these may be addressed by inducing superthermal E ×B rotation, which provides MHD stability through veloc-ity shear and increases axial confinement by the centrifugal force [2]–[4]. In past experiments, the rotation has been pro-duced by electrodes in the mirror throat, and these <b>electrodes</b> limited the <b>rotation</b> speed to the Alfven critical ionization velocity (CIV) [2], [5], [6]. However, rotation might best be produced by waves rather than electrodes, allowing the CIV limit to be overcome [7]. The method of driving rotation with waves is an extension of the alpha channeling effect in tokamaks [8]. In alpha channel-ing, waves are injected which create a diffusion path connecting the hot core of the plasma to the cold edge. That is, there is coupled diffusion in energy and position. As alpha particles interact with the wave, they diffuse radially and may eventually exit at the outer edge. Because the radial diffusion is related to diffusion in energy by the wave properties, alpha particles can be made to exit at low energy, transferring their energy to the wave. The wave energy can then be used for heating ions or other purposes [9]...|$|R

Mechanisms have been proposed, based on the electrochemical responses recorded during polymer formation and characterization of the resulting polymer films by cyclic voltammetry, ac impedance spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy as well as by x-ray emission spectroscopy. [...] A rotating Pt disc electrode was applied to probe the potentiostatic deposition of poly(3 -methylthiophene). It was observed that poly(3 -methylthiophene) films could be formed on both stationary and rotating <b>electrodes</b> even at <b>rotation</b> rates as high as 1600 rpm (revolutions per minute), and that the quantity of polymer deposited decreased with increasing rotation rate. It was therefore concluded that polymer deposition takes place both through the precipitation of oligomeric intermediates from the solution, and via the coupling of monomeric species with polymer chain ends in the polymer film matrix. Chronoamperometric responses recorded during polymerization, as well as the characterization of the resulting polymer films by cyclic voltammetry, ac impedance spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy, demonstrated that the deposition of oligomeric intermediates from the solution contributes most to polymer formation on a stationary electrode. On the other hand, polymer growth on a rapidly rotating electrode occurs primarily by the incorporation of monomeric species into polymer chains grafted on the electrode surface. Much smoother, more homogeneous films were deposited on rotating electrodes.

40|$|MSc (Chemistry), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The ever {{increasing}} {{demand for a}} clean and renewable energy source has stimulated research for alternatives {{for the use of}} fossil fuels, which contribute significantly to global warming. The SO 2 oxidation reaction was studied for production of hydrogen as a clean and renewable energy carrier. This reaction occurs at a lower standard electrode potential (0. 158 V vs. SHE) than normal water electrolysis (1. 23 V vs. SHE). This is a theoretical indication that the SO 2 oxidation reaction has possible potential when compared to normal water electrolysis, since hydrogen production may occur at lower potentials and therefore lower cost. Rh was compared with Pt for the SO 2 oxidation reaction since little research has been done on this catalyst and many studies exist in which Pt was used as catalyst. The oxygen reduction reaction and ethanol oxidation reaction were also included in this study to create a foundation for the catalysts studied, since the SO 2 oxidation reaction is complicated by different adsorbed species that can form according to various mechanisms. The electrochemical techniques employed in this study to characterize the catalysts included cyclic voltammetry from which onset potentials and limiting current densities were determined, as well as from which some qualitative analysis was done. Linear polarization experiments were used during rotating disk electrode studies from which Levich and Koutecky-Levich analyses were done and the number of electrons transferred calculated and compared between the two catalysts. From the Koutecky-Levich analysis the kinetic current density was also obtained for use in Tafel analysis for further comparison between catalysts. It was found that Rh showed good behaviour for the oxygen reduction reaction when compared to Pt with similar onset potentials and limiting current densities. From Levich analysis it was concluded that both catalysts achieved diffusion limitation at high overpotentials. However, from the calculated number of electrons transferred it was evident that a difference in mechanism existed between catalysts and that the mechanism for both changed in the potential range studied, which is confirmed by the Tafel slopes. For the ethanol oxidation reaction it was shown that Rh exhibited very low catalytic activity in comparison with Pt. However, it was concluded from cyclic voltammetry and rotating disk electrode studies that more adsorbed species were present on the surface of Rh than on Pt. These results confirmed the possibility of using Rh as a co-catalyst together with Pt since it was shown from rotating disk electrode studies that low adsorption of ethanol and its oxidation products caused species to be transported away {{from the surface of the}} <b>electrode</b> during <b>rotation.</b> For the SO 2 oxidation reaction it was found that Rh exhibited very poor catalytic activity together with being very susceptible to poisoning by adsorbed species. Pt showed very good behaviour, which corresponded well with what had been observed in literature. Levich analysis revealed that Pt did not exhibit diffusion limitation and Koutecky-Levich analysis revealed that a 2 electron reaction occurred on Pt, which corresponds with the SO 2 oxidation reaction during which 2 electrons are transferred. It was, therefore, shown that Rh could exhibit good behaviour and act as a suitable catalyst in certain circumstances. However, for the SO 2 oxidation reaction, which was the main focus of this study it was shown that Rh is not a suitable catalyst, either alone or as co-catalyst. Master...|$|R
40|$|The electrocatalytic {{oxidation}} of hydrazine was studied using an ordinary pyrolytic graphite electrode modified with iron tetrapyridinoporphyrazine complex (FeTPyPz), employing cyclic voltammetry and rotating disk electrode techniques. Analyses of the voltammograms recorded at different potential scan {{rates and the}} polarization curves at different <b>electrode</b> <b>rotation</b> rates showed that the reaction of electrooxidation of hydrazine on FeTPyPz occurs via 4 -electrons {{with the formation of}} N 2 as main product. The kinetic parameters suggest that the second electron transfer step is rate controlling. The activity of FeTPyPz depends on its Fe(II) /Fe(I) formal potential and fits well in a volcano plot that includes several iron phthalocyanines, indicating that such formal potential is a good reactivity index for these complexes...|$|E

40|$|Acidic aqueous nickel(II) sulfamate {{solutions}} {{are widely used}} for industrial nickel electroplating. The finite lifetimes of these baths are caused by the hydrolysis of sulfamate ions to ammonium ions which raise the stress in the nickel deposits. Spent solutions require treatment to recover the NiII, typically present at ca. 10 ³ mol m-³, because consent concentrations for discharge to sewers are ca. 2 x 10 -² mol m-³. The aim of this project was to develop an electrochemical process and suitable control methods for treating the concentrated effluents by electrodeposition of NiII. The electrochemical reactor designed with a nickel mesh cathode, a Pt/Ti oxygen-evolving anode, and a cation-permeable membrane, was operated at constant current in batch-recycle mode. Elemental nickel was electrodeposited onto the cathode from the catholyte-effluent, separated from the aqueous sodium sulfate anolyte by the membrane, which prevented the oxidation of the sulfamate ions in the effluent and thus restricted the anodic reaction {{to the evolution of}} O 2. Experiments with this system demonstrated that NiII could be recovered at current efficiencies greater than 90 % if the catholyte-effluent pH was maintained in the range 2. 5 - 4. 5 and if the magnitude of the applied current was regulated to be smaller than the mass transport limited NiII reduction current. Continuous additions of NaOH into the anolyte during reactor operation effectively decreased the rate of proton migration through the membrane from anolyte to catholyte and prevented the catholyte pH decreasing, so minimising the hydrogen evolution rate, the primary cause of the current efficiency always being less than 100 %. Increase in catholyte pH to values above 4. 5 occured when effluents were contaminated with iron(III), present as either Fe 2 O 3 or Fe(OH) 3, the reduction of which consumed protons and caused cathode passivation due to formation of Ni(OH) 2. The magnitude of the applied current was adjusted during the NiII depletion process to ensure it did not exceed the mass transport limited value for a given solution flow rate at any time. km(NiII) values, used to predict the limiting current densities, were derived from results of separate experiments in which mass transport limited reduction current densities of hexacyanoferrate(III) ions were measured as a function of flow rate in alkaline solution. Using these control methods, which were optimised using a reactor model incorporating mass balances, NiII concentrations in the effluent could be decreased by over 90 %. Using the typically measured average current efficiency of 95 % and the cell potential difference, typically 4. 5 V {{in the presence of a}} Pt/Ti mesh anode, the specific electrical energy consumption was evaluated as ca. 4 300 kW h (tonne Ni) -¹, equivalent to ca. $ 650 (tonne Ni) -¹, which is two orders of magnitude lower than the price of elemental nickel, currently $ 22 k tonne-¹. A micro-kinetic model was developed to describe the reduction mechanisms of nickel(II) and protons, considered as sequential one-electron charge transfers via separate adsorbed intermediates, as functions of electrode potential, ion concentrations and mass transport rates. This was coupled with the reactor model to facilitate predictions of reactor performance, based on the kinetic rate coe fficients and transfer coefficients. In order to determine these kinetic parameters the kinetics of nickel(II) and proton / water reduction were measured in sulfamate solutions on a rotating Ni disc electrode and on a Au EQCM as a function of NiII concentration, bulk pH, <b>electrode</b> potential and <b>rotation</b> rate.

40|$|The {{shift towards}} {{renewable}} energy solutions {{in order to}} meet the demands of an exponentially growing populace has resulted in significant amounts of research into new, environmentally friendly, power generating technologies. Among these innovations, biofuel cells capable of utilising non-toxic, non-flammable and renewable fuel substrates have begun to gain momentum due to the portability and projected low cost of such devices. However, the commercialisation and mass adoption of biofuel cells has been hampered by their less than ideal performance characteristics when compared to inorganic based fuel cell technologies. For example, low power outputs due to potential losses within the cell arising from complex reaction pathways, low current densities resulting from low surface area electrodes, and enzyme immobilisation strategies that are difficult to scale up to practical sizes remain factors that need to be addressed. In addition, the stability of such devices is often an inhibiting factor to widespread adoption since the poor lifetime of the enzymatic species utilised within a biofuel cell often limits their practical usage to a time scale well below that of their inorganic counterparts. This thesis aimed to address the above problems through several different strategies. These were: 1) Employing a high surface area electrode material comprised of an interwoven network of nano-sized carbon fibres (named herein as NanoWeb) in order to increase the current densities able to be produced by a biofuel cell. 2) Increasing the working potential of biofuel cells by directly connecting the redox centres embedded in an enzyme with electrodes via the use of nanostructured carbon materials, and 3) Enhancing the lifetime and stability of biofuel cells through the use of a biocompatible, enzyme stabilising ionic liquid, choline dihydrogen phosphate. Electrochemical characterisation of the NanoWeb material was conducted using Fourier transform voltammetry and cyclic voltammetry, and the results compared to those obtained using other nanostructured carbon electrode materials. The former technique allowed the separation of capacitive, pseudo-capacitive and Faradaic responses, which was found to be essential since the NanoWeb material was found to have a high capacitance of nearly 1. 5 mF. cm- 2. The NanoWeb material was also found to have a large electroactive surface area of 2. 16 cm- 2 per square centimetre of geometric surface area, which is much larger than that of other nanostructured carbon materials such as carbon nanotubes and graphene. Direct electrical contact of the enzymes bilirubin oxidase and glucose oxidase to an electrode comprised of the NanoWeb material was investigated using cyclic voltammetry. While glucose oxidase immobilised at the NanoWeb electrode displayed redox activity attributable to its embedded cofactor, and thus appeared to be intimately connected to the electrode, only bilirubin oxidase was able to produce a catalytic current upon the introduction of its substrate, oxygen, into the cell. The current produced in the latter case was significant, reaching values as high as 270 μA. cm- 2. Immobilisation of both bilirubin oxidase and glucose oxidase in a redox mediating hydrogel at a NanoWeb modified electrode allowed large catalytic currents to be produced from relatively small amounts of reactants. Increased mass transport of substrate to the electrode surface was observed for such <b>electrodes,</b> with subsequent <b>rotation</b> of the <b>electrode</b> increasing the current density only marginally. Despite thicker films of redox hydrogel requiring rotational rates of up to 1500 rpm to achieve maximum current density, the NanoWeb was found to be a more effective electrode platform than others reported in the literature. Cathodes comprised of bilirubin oxidase immobilised in redox hydrogel at the surface of NanoWeb modified electrodes produced currents of up to 35. 49 μA. μg- 1 of enzyme or 8. 28 μA. μg- 1 of hydrogel. Such efficiency allowed for currents as high as 1. 86 mA to be produced from an electrode of only ~ 1 cm 2 (geometric area). Even larger current densities of 43. 55 μA. μg- 1 of glucose oxidase and 29. 27 μA. μg- 1 of hydrogel were produced at NanoWeb modified anodes when glucose was introduced into the cell. In this case, ~ 1 cm 2 (geometric area) electrodes were able to produce current densities exceeding 2. 3 mA. The catalytic oxidation of glucose by glucose oxidase was performed in mixed ChDHP/phosphate buffer media with ChDHP concentrations as high as 80 % (w/w). This is the highest concentration of an ionic liquid in a mixed solvent system ever used to successfully perform glucose oxidase based catalysis. Although the catalytic currents produced in ChDHP based electrolytes were lower than that obtained in purely aqueous media, this was found to be a direct consequence of the ILs low pH and high viscosity rather than any denaturing effect caused by the ionic liquid. Indeed, when data was normalised with respect to both the activity of the enzyme at low pH, as well as diffusional impedances caused by the high viscosity media, it was found that the catalytic currents produced in ChDHP based electrolytes were in fact higher than that obtained in aqueous buffer...|$|R
