In this paper we investigate whether the mobility of firms does indeed increase incentives for <b>environmental</b> <b>dumping.</b> We do this by taking a simple model of imperfect competition and comparing the environmental policies that would be set by non-cooperative governments for two different move structures - where governments set environmental policies after firms decide where to locate (the exogenous location case or Market Share Game) and where governments set environmental policies before firms decide where to locate (the endogenous location case or Location Game). This raises an important modelling issue for it is natural in the Market Share Game that governments would set different environmental policies depending {{on the number of}} firms that locate in their countries, and if we are to compare just the effect of different move structures then in the Location Game we should also allow governments to condition their environmental policies on the number of firms that locate in them, contrary to previous models of the Location Game where governments set a single instrument independent of the number of firms that locate in their countries. We show that the extent of <b>environmental</b> <b>dumping</b> in the Market Share Game may be greater or less than in the Location Game, depending in particular on the degree of substitution between products of the firms and hence the intensity of market competition. We also show that there is more <b>environmental</b> <b>dumping</b> in the Location Game when governments use a single instrument than when they condition their instruments on the number of firms that locate in their countries...|$|E

Soon the economy began to change as government and business elites were the main people affecting land-use decisions. A general theme arose of polluting industries coming into poor minority communities where local community leaders had no input. The environmental risks were traded for jobs. Key local leaders supported Chemical Waste Management, as the counties budgets were increased $5.00 for every ton of waste buried in the county.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} how the WTO agreement {{deals with}} the environmental and competitiveness concerns linked to trade and environmental policies. As the use of traditional export subsidies and other protectionist trade policies are now strongly restricted in the WTO, many countries will try to find other ways to increase competitiveness. One way of doing this is to use lax environmental taxation or regulation as indirect subsidies (i. e. 'environmental dumping'). If this is done, the reduced possibilities of using traditional protectionist trade policies could harm the environment, thus reducing the overall welfare gain from trade liberalization. Environmental countervailing tariffs have been suggested {{as a way of}} reducing incentives for <b>environmental</b> <b>dumping.</b> The WTO rules are examined in order to analyse the feasibility of the uses of environmental countervailing tariffs in the current and future framework of WTO, and the incentives and welfare consequences are analysed under different market scenarios.

40|$|Slag {{cleaning}} {{is important}} from both an economical and <b>environmental</b> perspective. <b>Dump</b> slags from copper smelting {{prove to be}} a valuable source of base metals, but the abundance of iron in the slag leads to significant amounts of iron reporting to the alloy phase during carbothermic reduction, which poses a significant cost to remove in subsequent hydrometallurgical processes. A carbothermic reduction of nonferrous smelter slag was conducted under the influence of three different slag modifiers to investigate the recovery of cobalt (and copper) versus iron recovery. The test work was performed in two campaigns; one campaign was performed under a constant oxygen potential of 4. 33 × 10 - 9 atm, while the other set of test work was performed using graphite under a pure argon atmosphere. It is shown in both cases that, out of these slag modifiers used, TiO 2 had a more selective recovery of cobalt compared to CaO and CaF 2. It appears that TiO 2 reduces the activity coefficient of the FeO in slag due to its strong affinity for FeO in the slag phase. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this way, contrary to the prevailing decentralized methodology {{of environmental protection}} and negation of the pollution aftereffects, it is recommended to form a unified database of main pollutants for the whole region. This database enables impact detection of specific factors (industrial facilities, waste dumps and other pollutants) on a scale which transcends to neighboring municipalities, regions, or the overall country. The state of the environment and waste management in the South Morava region is directly impacted by an array of environmentally degradable factors, with economics being the most prominent one (industrial facilities, which represented the main pollutants in the past, applied little, if any, regard to the <b>environmental</b> protection, <b>dumping</b> their waste on improvised, unprotected waste dumps).

40|$|Now-a-days the {{depletion}} of natural resources {{has been a major}} issue in the construction sector from which the road segment cannot be excluded. Because of the extensive road construction processes the aggregate demand is so huge that lots of blastings, quarrying, crushing and transportation activities are consuming a lot of energies, but also the aggregate materials are depleting fast and are in short supply. On the other hand, industrial wastes, by-products and locally available unused materials which are considered as non-conventional materials are causing <b>environmental</b> and <b>dumping</b> problems, but can have a potential for their application in road constructions. In the present study, an attempt has been made to utilise two types of materials such as the slag, a waste material from the steel industries and locally and abundantly available gravel (moorum) in the road sub-bases. The chemical composition, phase composition, toxic and heavy metals present in both the slag and its leachate water are studied. Its gradation and other physical properties are studied by using suitable tests and techniques. Conventional crushed aggregates are also used in conjunction with the slag or moorum to satisfy the desired grading for use in a particular layer as per the specifications of the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.
