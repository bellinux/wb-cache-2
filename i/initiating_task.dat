40|$|Joint {{attention}} (JA), whose {{deficit is}} an early risk marker for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), has two dimensions: (1) responding to JA and (2) initiating JA. Eye-tracking technology has largely been used to investigate responding JA, but rarely to study initiating JA especially in young children with ASD. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the differences in the visual patterns of toddlers with ASD and those with typical development (TD) during both responding JA and <b>initiating</b> JA <b>tasks.</b> Eye-tracking technology was used to monitor the gaze of 17 children with ASD and 15 age-matched children with TD during the presentation of short video sequences involving one responding JA and two <b>initiating</b> JA <b>tasks</b> (<b>initiating</b> JA- 1 and initiating JA- 2). Gaze accuracy, transitions and fixations were analyzed. No differences were found in the responding JA task between children with ASD and those with TD, whereas, in the <b>initiating</b> JA <b>tasks,</b> different patterns of fixation and transitions were shown between the groups. These results suggest that children with ASD and those with TD show different visual patterns when they are expected to initiate joint attention but not when they respond to joint attention. We hypothesized that differences in transitions and fixations are linked to ASD impairments in visual disengagement from face, in global scanning of the scene and in the ability to anticipate object's action...|$|R

40|$|To make {{efficient}} use of multiple processor computing resources, system schedulers may implement load sharing or balancing algorithms. Some algorithms operate dynamically {{and are able to}} change their behavior in response to changing system conditions. We present one such algorithm based upon the concept of a spanning tree. We describe those characteristics which provide its adaptive nature and compare its performance to other well-known load balancing algorithms. A study of the operation of the algorithms under different workload models illustrates the adaptability of the tree-based approach. Keywords: load balancing, multiprocessor scheduling. 1 Introduction In any system composed of multiple processors, the workload is likely to be imbalanced [4].

General cognitive abilities, verbal/nonverbal working memory and visual-spatial processing data were collected at 24 months.  Results Neonatal risks did not moderate the associations between SES and 24 -month outcomes. However, lower mother-initiated task changes were related to better 24 -month visual-spatial processing among children living in higher SES homes. Mothers’ flexible responses to child <b>initiated</b> <b>task</b> changes similarly moderated the impact of SES on 24 -month visual-spatial processing.  Conclusion Our results suggest that mothers’ play behaviors differentially relate to child outcomes depending on household SES...|$|R

Research hypotheses were developed and tested using regression analysis. To test the hypotheses, we distributed 550 questionnaires among the employees in nine insurance companies in South Korea. Finally we used 296 valid responses for our analysis. Two hypotheses showed significant result while others did not show any potential impact. The major findings indicate that attitude about shared leadership has {{a positive impact on}} team effectiveness. One dimension of task interdependence, RTID did suppress the relationship between shared leadership and team effectiveness. But for ITID, we did not get any positive moderating effect between the relationships. For practical implications it suggests that attitude about shared leadership should be prioritized to accelerate team effectiveness. Moreover, team leadership should use less of RTID when shared leadership is exercised by the team leaders to improve the level of team effectiveness...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{multicore}} {{systems have}} become a dominant architecture, introducing new challenges {{that need to be}} addressed in order to take full advantage of their efficiency. Reconfigurable computing has also received a great deal of attention due to its ability to increase the performance of an application through hardware execution, while retaining the flexibility of a software solution. Grouping tasks within an application contributes to coarse-grained partitioning, which can eventually improve the performance of the system. In this paper, we introduce a clustering framework along with a flexible multi-purpose clustering algorithm that <b>initiates</b> <b>task</b> clustering at the functional level based on dynamic profiling information. The clustering framework can be used as the basic step to modify the granularity of tasks in the hardware/software partitioning and scheduling phases. As a result, an elaborate mapping onto the system resources and possibly a higher degree of task parallelism becomes feasible. The framework particularly targets two objectives, 1) to form workload-balanced and 2) loosely-coupled clusters. We evaluated its efficiency using MJPEG as a case study. The experimental results comply with the desired clustering metrics defined through the objectives. 1...|$|R

40|$|Sysman is {{a system}} {{management}} infrastructure for clusters and data centers similar to the /proc file system.

In the Sysman virtual file system each managed entity (e. g., power on/off button of a server, CPU utilization of a server, a LUN on a storage device), is represented by a file. Reading from Sysman files obtains active information from devices being managed by Sysman. Writing to Sysman files <b>initiates</b> <b>tasks</b> such as turning on/off server blades, discovering new devices, and changing the boot order of a blade. The combination of the file access semantics and existing UNIX utilities such as grep and find that operate on multiple files allow the creation of very short but powerful system management procedures for large clusters. Sysman is an extensible framework and has a simple interface through which new system management procedures can be easily added. We show that by using a few lines of Linux commands system management operations can be issued to more than 2000 servers in one second and the results can be collected at a rate of more than seven servers per second.
