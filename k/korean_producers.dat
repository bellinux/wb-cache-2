2500|$|In the 1990s, {{a dispute}} arose {{regarding}} {{the marketing of}} kimchi, {{considered to be a}} traditional Korean dish. Kimchi was growing in popularity, and its consumption and production were expanding. Korean manufacturers, however, argued that Japanese kimchi is fundamentally different, in that Japanese manufacturers often skip fermentation and mimic the flavors through the use of additives. South <b>Korean</b> <b>producers</b> argued that this made the product fundamentally different from kimchi, while Japanese producers argued they were simply altering the product to fit local tastes. In 2000, South Korea began lobbying the makers of the Codex Alimentarius, an international food-standards maker which provides voluntary advice to national food agencies, to designate kimchi as only that which is produced in the traditional Korean style. In 2001, the Codex Alimentarius published a voluntary standard defining kimchi as [...] "a fermented food that uses salted napa cabbages as its main ingredient mixed with seasonings, and goes through a lactic acid production process at a low temperature," [...] but which did not specify a minimum amount of fermentation or forbid the use of additives.|$|E

50|$|The 1990s famine paralyzed {{many of the}} Marxist-Leninist {{economic}} institutions. The government pursued Kim Jong Il's Songun policy, {{under which}} the military is deployed to direct production and infrastructure projects. As {{a consequence of the}} government's policy of establishing economic self-sufficiency, the North Korean economy has become increasingly isolated from that {{of the rest of the}} world, and its industrial development and structure do not reflect its international competitiveness. Domestic firms are shielded from international as well as domestic competition; the result is chronic inefficiency, poor quality, limited product diversity, and underutilization of plants. This protectionism also limits the size of the market for North <b>Korean</b> <b>producers,</b> which prevents taking advantage of economies of scale.|$|E

50|$|The U.S International Trade Commission ruled 6-0 {{in favor}} of Whirlpool, finding that the U.S washing machine {{industry}} was threatened by imports of residential washers from South Korea. Also, the commission stated South <b>Korean</b> <b>producers,</b> Daewoo, LG, and Samsung were dumping washing machines far below their market value. Investigation into the matter led to the finding that LG and Samsung's market sales in the United States were found significantly different and the differences were not taken into account using the average-to-average method. A countervailing duty of over 72 percent was set for Daewoo, while the two other South Korean companies were given much smaller duties of below two percent. LG Electronics Inc. faced a dumping margin of 13.02, while Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. received a 9.29 percent dumping duty rate. Both LG and Samsung have since challenged Commerce's findings in the U.S. Court of International Trade, using {{the argument that the}} ITC improperly used the zeroing method to calculate dumping margins.|$|E
