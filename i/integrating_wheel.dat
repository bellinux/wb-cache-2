Design/methodology/approach: The accelerometers were fixed directly to the rail to provide the system with the best defect signal quality. Analysis of the acoustic signals collected using microphones proved that {{too much of the}} background noise limited their usefulness. Findings: It has been proven that all wheel geometry defects can be reliably detected and classified according to the experimentally established defect categories. Research limitations/implications: Exact measurements of the wheel defect geometry may be possible only after collecting huge signals time series along with the wheel measurements taken with other methods to reveal the relationships between them.

40|$|The {{motivation}} {{for the development of}} vehicle stability control systems {{comes from the fact that}} vehicle dynamic behavior in unfavorable driving conditions such as low road-tire adhesion and high speed differs greatly from its nominal behavior. Due to this unexpected behavior, a driver may not be successful in controlling the vehicle in challenging driving situations based only on her/his everyday driving experience. Several noteworthy research works have been conducted on stability control systems over the last two decades to prevent car accidents due to human error. Most of the resultant stability controllers contain individual modules, where each perform a particular task such as yaw tracking, sideslip control, or wheel slip control. These design requirements may contradict each other in some driving scenarios. In such situations, inconsistent control actions can be generated with individual modules. The development of a stability controller that can satisfy diverse and often contradictory requirements is a great challenge. In general, transferring a control structure from one vehicle to another with a different drivetrain layout and actuation system configuration requires remarkable rectifications and repetition of tuning processes from the beginning to achieve a similar performance. This can be considered to be a serious drawback for car manufacturing companies since it results in extra effort, time, and expenses in redesigning and retuning the controller. In this thesis, an integrated controller with a modular structure has been designed to concurrently provide control of the vehicle chassis (yaw rate and sideslip control) and wheel stability (wheel slip ratio control). The proposed control structure incorporates longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics to decide on a unified control action. This control action is an outcome of solving an optimization problem that considers all the control objectives in a single cost function, so <b>integrated</b> <b>wheel</b> and vehicle stability is guaranteed. Moreover, according to the particular modular design of the proposed control structure, it can be easily reconfigured to work with different drivetrain layouts such as all-wheel-drive, front-wheel-drive, and rear-wheel-drive, as well as various actuators such as torque vectoring, differential braking, and active steering systems. The high-level control module provides a Center of Gravity (CG) based error analysis and determines the required longitudinal forces and yaw moment adjustments. The low-level control module utilizes this information to allocate control actions optimally at each vehicle corner (wheel) through a single or multi-actuator regime. In order to consider the effect of the actuator dynamics, a mathematical description of the auction system is included in distribution objective function. Therefore, a legitimate control performance is promised in situations requiring shifting from one configuration to another with minimal modifications. The performance of the proposed modular control structure is examined in simulations with a high-fidelity model of an electric GM Equinox vehicle. The high-fidelity model has been developed and provided by GM and the use of the model is to reduce the number of labor-intensive vehicle test and is to test extreme and dangerous driving conditions. Several driving scenarios with severe steering and throttle commands, then, are designed to evaluate the capability of the proposed control structure in integrated longitudinal and lateral vehicle stabilization on slippery road condition. Experimental tests also have been performed with two different electric vehicles for real-time implementation as well as validation purposes. The observations verified the performance qualifications of the proposed control structure to preserve <b>integrated</b> <b>wheel</b> and vehicle chassis stability in all track tests...|$|R
40|$|The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R Series (GOES-R) is {{the first}} of the next {{generation}} geostationary weather satellites, scheduled for delivery in late 2015. GOES-R represents a quantum increase in Earth and solar weather observation capabilities, with 4 times the resolution, 5 times the observation rate, and 3 times the number of spectral bands for Earth observations. With the improved resolution, comes the instrument suite's increased sensitive to disturbances over a broad spectrum 0 - 512 Hz. Sources of disturbance include reaction wheels, thruster firings for station keeping and momentum management, gimbal motion, and internal instrument disturbances. To minimize the impact of these disturbances, the baseline design includes an Earth Pointed Platform (EPP), a stiff optical bench to which the two nadir pointed instruments are collocated together with the Guidance Navigation & Control (GN&C) star trackers and Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). The EPP is passively isolated from the spacecraft bus with Honeywell D-Strut isolators providing attenuation for frequencies above approximately 5 Hz in all six degrees-of-freedom. A change in Reaction Wheel Assembly (RWA) vendors occurred very late in the program. To reduce the risk of RWA disturbances impacting performance, a secondary passive isolation system manufactured by Moog CSA Engineering was incorporated under each of the six 160 Nms RWAs, tuned to provide attenuation at frequencies above approximately 50 Hz. <b>Integrated</b> <b>wheel</b> and isolator testing was performed on a Kistler table at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.

40|$|The thesis work {{develops}} an {{instantaneous power}} optimal attitude control for a spacecraft utilizing an <b>integrated</b> reaction <b>wheel</b> - flywheel system allowing for energy storage and return. The control is generally formulated to utilize an arbitrarily {{large number of}} reaction wheels, and is applicable to any system with redundant wheels spanning three-dimensional space. This is accomplished by manipulation of the wheel torque null motion such that the resulting attitude dynamics are not affected. By application of physical constraints on the wheel motor performance, the solution method to find the null torques is reduced to a hyperdimensional vector geometry problem, and the proper control torques are uniquely determined. The resulting power optimal control guarantees that the instantaneous maximum power is returned from the reaction wheels at all times. This control is then applied {{to a variety of}} control laws, demonstrating its behavior for a variety of control applications and initial spacecraft states. These include a velocity regulator control and attitude a velocity tracking control.

30|$|Odometry {{is widely}} used to {{localize}} wheeled and tracked vehicles because of its simplicity and continuity. Odometric calculations <b>integrate</b> the <b>wheel</b> or track’s rotation speed. The accuracy of position thus calculated, is affected by slippage between {{the ground and the}} wheel or track. When traveling on a loose slope, the localization accuracy of the odometry decreases remarkably due to slippage. To improve its accuracy in such environments, terramechanics focus on estimating the interaction between a vehicle and the ground. However, because these formulas are complicated and governed by many terrain-specific parameters, they are difficult to use in unknown environments. In this study, we propose slip estimation methods targeted toward use in unknown environments. We consider four types of slippage, based on the slippage direction and maneuver type. Longitudinal and lateral slippage occurring during straight maneuvering are derived by approximating the terramechanics slip model. In contrast, for turning maneuvers, longitudinal slippage is derived from an empirical equation for the relationship between slip ratio and input velocity, and lateral slippage is obtained from a regression function. We also proposed slip-compensated odometry, which applies the slip model to the kinematics of a skid-steering vehicle. To evaluate the proposed slip model and slip-compensated odometry, we conduct several experiments with a skid-steering tracked vehicle on an indoor sandy slope. Experimental results confirmed that position estimation accuracy was improved by introducing slip-compensated odometry compared to conventional odometry.|$|R

The air that rams into the engine bay, is used for cooling, combustion, and for passengers, then reaccelerated by a nozzle and then ejected under the floor.For mid and rear engines air is decelerated and pressurized in a diffuser, loses some pressure as it passes the engine bay, and fills the slipstream. These cars need a seal between the low pressure region around the wheels and the high pressure around the gearbox.They all have a closed engine bay floor.The suspension is either streamlined (Aptera) or retracted.Door handles, the antenna, and roof rails can have a streamlined shape.

The four steps of boundary setting, metrics selection, analysis and visualization, and sensemaking and storytelling form the cyclic Ostinato process (Huhtamäki et al. 2015) for developing shared vision through establishing and questioning a frame through which evidence can be examined. Network metrics and network visualizations reveal existing relationships and distinct patterns of business ecosystem structure {{in each of the}} metropolitan areas and provide insights on the engagement, agility, social cohesion, vitality, linking factors, and embeddedness of metropolitan areas, as relational constructs for spatially defined innovation.|$|R
