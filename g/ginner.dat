25|$|Walter Sickert and the Camden Town Group {{developed}} an English style of Impressionism and Post-Impressionism {{with a strong}} strand of social documentary, including Harold Gilman, Spencer Frederick Gore, Charles <b>Ginner,</b> Robert Bevan, Malcolm Drummond and Lucien Pissarro (the son of French Impressionist painter Camille Pissarro). Where their colouring is often notoriously drab, the Scottish Colourists indeed mostly used bright light and colour; some, like Samuel Peploe and John Duncan Fergusson, were living in France to find suitable subjects. They were initially inspired by Sir William McTaggart (1835–1910), a Scottish landscape painter associated with Impressionism.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{present study}} {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} the pulmonary functions and exposure to cotton dust. Pulmonary function tests i. e. forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in first second (FEV 1), and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) were recorded in 64 non smoker cotton <b>ginners.</b> The data on pulmonary function test for healthy Pakistani population from previous studies was used as control. The follow-up study for lung function testing on the same cotton <b>ginners</b> was conducted from 1999 and repeated yearly up to 2005. Because of cotton dust exposure, cotton <b>ginners</b> showed a significant decline in their pulmonary function (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: We concluded that the continuous exposure to cotton dust in <b>ginners</b> is associated with an increased progressive impairment of pulmonary functions. Keywords...|$|R

30|$|For long, {{the cotton}} sector was {{governed by a}} {{parastatal}} company called SONAPRA (Société Nationale pour la Promotion Agricole) which had the monopoly {{over most of the}} commercial roles relating to cotton production, such as purchase and distribution of seeds and fertilizers as well as pesticides, direct purchasing of cotton from the farmer, and determination of price (Kütting 2004). But, {{since the beginning of the}} 1990 s the sector has undergone some reforms including the privatization of input supply, introduction of private <b>ginners</b> and creation of interprofessional bodies to take over the sector management, through a highly regulated system precluding competition among <b>ginners</b> (Gergely 2009). However, during the last three years the new institutional arrangement collapsed due to a number of crises that resulted in distrust and mistrust between the government and the private stakeholders (Glin 2014). Despite all the upheavals and changes experienced by the sector, the method of production of conventional cotton has remained virtually unchanged with a strong use of synthetic chemical inputs.|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} cotton gins {{in the state}} of Texas has {{declined}} from over 1, 400 gins in 1960 to less than 232 gins in 2011. Texas has experienced an increase in cotton production since that time, and now remains relatively constant at 5. 5 million bales ginned annually. A Decision Support Software package was produced and published for cotton <b>ginners</b> to determine the economic risks and benefits of transporting seed cotton modules from the field to the gin. Using gin data from U. S Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service and Texas Cotton <b>Ginner?s</b> Association from 2005 - 2010, the software package has aided many in the cotton industry to determine the limits of economic viability of seed cotton transport in remote areas where long distance module hauling was imminent. The increasing production of seed cotton along with the decreasing number of cotton gins in Texas justifies the need for an updated software package with the goal of more efficient cotton handling and ginning systems. Specifically, fewer gins and increased production will likely result in transporting seed cotton longer distances. Using reported gin data from 2011 U. S Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service and data from cooperating gins, the previous transportation model produced in 2009 is being updated to reflect current economic conditions. This paper explains how non-conventional module types were incorporated into the transportation calculator to aid cotton <b>ginners</b> and producers in making sound management decisions relating to module transportation. It also details analysis that indicate factors that have the greatest impact on the cost of transportation as well as methods to determine the breakeven point of owning trucks compared to contracting trucks...|$|R
