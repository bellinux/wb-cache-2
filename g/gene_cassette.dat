After selection of recombinants, a subsequent transformation to transfect linear DNA with the desired mutation is performed, which will then be homologously recombined into the cellular DNA in place of the marker. Therefore, counterselection against the cells containing the marker needs to be performed in order to identify the cells that have successfully incorporated the linear DNA into the target sequence. This can be verified using PCR screening.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTIntegrons are genetic {{elements}} {{composed of}} a gene encoding an integrase, <b>gene</b> <b>cassettes</b> and an integration site for the <b>gene</b> <b>cassettes</b> (att). The integrase excises and integrates the <b>gene</b> <b>cassettes</b> from and into the integron, but integrons themselves are not mobile. Two groups of integrons are known: resistance integrons and super-integrons. Nearly all known <b>gene</b> <b>cassettes</b> from resistance integrons encode resistance to antibiotics or disinfectants. These integrons are found on transposons, plasmids and the bacterial chromosome. <b>Gene</b> <b>cassettes</b> in super-integrons encode {{a variety of different}} functions. Super-integrons are located on the bacterial chromosome. More than 100 <b>gene</b> <b>cassettes</b> may be present, in contrast to resistance integrons where less than ten cassettes are present. Many species harbour super-integrons, which are species-specific, whereas particular resistance integrons {{can be found in a}} variety of species. The <b>gene</b> <b>cassettes</b> in resistance integrons probably originated from super-integrons. In the last few years, a variety of new <b>gene</b> <b>cassettes</b> have been described.

The key element of integrons is the integrase, which allows <b>gene</b> <b>cassettes</b> to be acquired and shuffled. Planktonic culture experiments have shown that integrase expression is regulated by the bacterial SOS response. In natural settings, however, bacteria generally live in biofilms, which are characterized by strong antibiotic resilience and by increased expression of stress-related genes. Here, we report that under biofilm conditions, the stringent response, which is induced upon starvation, (i) increases basal integrase and SOS regulon gene expression via induction of the SOS response and (ii) exerts biofilm-specific regulation of the integrase via the Lon protease.

40|$|Integrons are genetic {{elements}} that acquire and exchange exogenous DNA, known as <b>gene</b> <b>cassettes,</b> by a site-specific recombination mechanism. Characterized <b>gene</b> <b>cassettes</b> {{consist of a}} target recombination sequence (attC site) usually associated with a single open reading frame coding for an antibiotic resistance determinant. The affiliation of multiresistant integrons (MRIs), which contain various combinations of antibiotic resistance <b>gene</b> <b>cassettes,</b> with transferable elements underlies the rapid evolution of multidrug resistance among diverse Gram-negative bacteria. Yet the origin of MRIs remains unknown. Recently, a chromosomal super-integron (SI) harboring hundreds of cassettes was identified in the Vibrio cholerae genome. Here, we demonstrate that the activity of its associated integrase is identical {{to that of the}} MRI integrase, IntI 1. We have also identified equivalent integron superstructures in nine distinct genera throughout the γ-proteobacterial radiation. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the evolutionary history of the system paralleled that of the radiation, indicating that integrons are ancient structures. The attC sites of the 63 antibiotic-resistance <b>gene</b> <b>cassettes</b> identified thus far in MRIs are highly variable. Strikingly, one-fifth of these were virtually identical to the highly related yet species-specific attC sites of the SIs described here. Furthermore, antimicrobial resistance homologues were identified among the thousands of genes entrapped by these SIs. Because the <b>gene</b> <b>cassettes</b> of SIs are substrates for MRIs, these data identify SIs as the source of contemporary MRIs and their cassettes. However, our demonstration of the metabolic functions, beyond antibiotic resistance and virulence, of three distinct SI <b>gene</b> <b>cassettes</b> indicates that integrons function as a general gene-capture system for bacterial innovation...|$|R

Consequently, a major proportion of both genetic diversity within known gene families and an unknown number of novel gene families reside in these uncultured organisms. Isolation of these genes is limited by lack of sequence information. Where such sequence data exist, PCR directed at conserved sequence motifs recovers only partial genes. Here we outline a strategy for recovering complete open reading frames from environmental DNA samples. PCR assays were designed to target the 59 -base element family of recombination sites that flank <b>gene</b> <b>cassettes</b> associated with integrons. Using such assays, diverse <b>gene</b> <b>cassettes</b> could be amplified from the {{vast majority}} of environmental DNA samples tested. These <b>gene</b> <b>cassettes</b> contained complete open reading frames, the majority of which were associated with ribosome binding sites.

However, the majority of amplified <b>gene</b> <b>cassettes</b> contained open reading frames with no identifiable homologues in databases. Accumulation analysis of the <b>gene</b> <b>cassettes</b> amplified from soil samples showed no signs of saturation, and soil samples taken at 1 -m intervals along transects demonstrated different amplification profiles.

Identifying the iron oxidation pathway in the Zetaproteobacteria began {{with the publication of}} the first described cultured representative, M. ferrooxydans strain PV-1. In this genome, the gene neighborhood of a molybdopterin oxidoreductase protein was identified as a place to start looking at candidate iron oxidation pathway genes. In a follow up analysis of a metagenomic sample, Singer et al. (2013) concluded that this molybdopterin oxidoreductase <b>gene</b> <b>cassette</b> was likely involved in Fe oxidation. Comparative analysis of several single cell genomes, however, suggested an alternative conserved <b>gene</b> <b>cassette</b> with several cytochrome c and cytochrome oxidase genes to be involved in Fe oxidation.

Biocides have a longer use in clinical practice than antibiotics, and a qac (quaternary ammonium compound) resistance gene, or remnant thereof, is a normal feature of class 1 integrons recovered from clinical isolates. Consequently, {{it is possible that the}} initial selective advantage was conferred by resistance to biocides, mediated by qac.
