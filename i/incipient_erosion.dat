50|$|Mexico faces {{significant}} environmental challenges damaging {{nearly all}} {{sections of the}} country. Vast expanses of southern and southeastern tropical forests have been denuded for cattle-raising and agriculture. For example, tropical forests covered {{almost half of the}} state of Tabasco in 1940 but less than 10% by the late 1980s. During the same period, pastureland increased from 20 to 60% of the state's total area. Analysts reported similar conditions in other tropical sections of Mexico. Deforestation and desertification has contributed to serious levels of soil erosion nationwide. In 1985 the government classified almost 17% of all land as totally eroded, 31% in an accelerated state of erosion, and 38% demonstrating signs of <b>incipient</b> <b>erosion.</b> Mexico has developed a Biodiversity Action Plan to address issues of endangered species and habitats that merit protection.|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} two decades the coastal districts of New Zealand have {{received}} increasing attention, in terms of recreation, settlement, pollution and the evaluation of mineral deposits. This trend is clearly in evidence along the west Wellington coast, especially in relation to the pressure of a rapidly increasing population on coastal facilities. The region considered in this thesis as the west Wellington coast is shown in Figure 1. For the southern coastal section, recently-mooted development proposals include the offshore siting of a Jumbo Jet airport and the establishment of a marina complex, with accompanying breakwater, in the vicinity of Kapiti Island. This southern section has a documented history of <b>incipient</b> <b>erosion</b> since the 1930 's, the consequences of which have been accentuated by widespread road, housing and property development on the foredunes. In recent months there has been renewed discussion on groyne and breakwater construction to protect these beaches...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} about the {{representation}} of minorities in mass media, and the tension between fully representing the diversity of that group and remaining accessible to the widest possible audience. The case study is the Welsh-language soap opera Pobol Y Cwm, and whether the regional dialects of Welsh are ‘toned down’ to ensure comprehensibility for all Welsh speakers. The first aim of the article is to bring language into the discussion of how minorities are represented in Public Service Broadcasting (PSB). A second and more general aim is {{to open up a}} frame for further research into the tensions that arise in representing local diversity and harnessing national/group identity. As a contribution to the sociology of globalisation, this article will be looking for a middle ground between the totalising ‘McDonaldisation’ thesis – where all cultural diversity is eradicated – and equally strong counterclaims about the vigorous reassertion of diversity (e. g. Katz and Liebes, 1990). I argue that neither is correct, and that we are facing a much more gradual and <b>incipient</b> <b>erosion</b> of cultural diversity as local minority cultures are packaged in global media forms; and that this must be understood as a constant ongoing process with a historical trajectory, not an end point that is ever ‘reached’ – either by total homogenisation or by persistent diversity. The case of local dialects in PSB therefore serves as an exemplar of the limitations in showcasing diversity within minorities in mass media...|$|E
