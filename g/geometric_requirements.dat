This can be utilized because hosts that are most commonly used are able to bond to the diyne monomer by halogen bonding from the lewis acidic iodine atom to a lewis basic nitrogen of the host (usually a nitrile or pyridine). In order to give a proper repeat distance to the monomers (5 Å), the hosts also contain oxalamide groups that create a hydrogen bonding network throughout the crystal.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{modularization}} {{of machine}} tool frames is an approach when designing new machine tool structures in a sustainable context. By integration of microsystem technology and designing lightweight modules, a smart alternative to conventional machine tool frames is developed.

In the presented paper, the <b>geometric</b> <b>requirements</b> from the selected use-case scenarios for machine tool structures are identified by dividing the structures in their ideal mechanic equivalents. A set of rules is developed driven by the generalized <b>geometric</b> <b>requirements</b> of the machine tool frames.

40|$|Many {{researches}} {{have been}} working on the protein folding problem from more than half century. Protein folding is indeed one of the major unsolved problems in science. In this work, we discuss a model for the simulation of protein conformations. This simple model is based on the idea of imposing few <b>geometric</b> <b>requirements</b> on chains of atoms representing the backbone of a protein conformation. The model leads to the formulation of a global optimization problem, whose solutions correspond to conformations satisfying the desired requirements. The global optimization problem is solved by the recently proposed Monkey Search algorithm. The simplicity of the optimization problem and the effectiveness of the used meta-heuristic search allowed the simulation of a large set of high-quality conformations. We show that, even though only few <b>geometric</b> <b>requirements</b> are imposed, some of the simulated conformation results to be similar (in terms of RMSD) to conformations real proteins actually have in nature. ...|$|E
40|$|QUIKVIS computes {{the times}} during an Earth orbit when <b>geometric</b> <b>requirements</b> are {{satisfied}} for observing celestial objects. The observed objects may be fixed (stars, etc.) or moving (sun, moon, planets). QUIKVIS {{is useful for}} preflight analysis by those needing information {{on the availability of}} celestial objects to be observed. Two types of analyses are performed by QUIKVIS. One is used when specific objects are known, the other when targets are unknown and potentially useful regions of the sky must be identified. The results are useful in selecting candidate targets, examining the effects of observation requirements, and doing gross assessments {{of the effects of the}} orbit's right ascension of the ascending node (RAAN). The results are not appropriate when high accuracy is needed (e. g. for scheduling actual mission operations). The observation duration is calculated as a function of date, orbit node, and <b>geometric</b> <b>requirements.</b> The orbit right ascension of the ascending node can be varied to account for the effects of an uncertain launch time of day. The orbit semimajor axis and inclination are constant throughout the run. A circular orbit is assumed, but a simple program modification will allow eccentric orbits. The <b>geometric</b> <b>requirements</b> that can be processed are: 1) minimum separation angle between the line of sight to the object and the earth's horizon; 2) minimum separation angle between the line of sight to the object and the spacecraft velocity vector; 3) maximum separation angle between the line of sight to the object and the zenith direction; and 4) presence of the spacecraft in the earth's shadow. The user must supply a date or date range, the spacecraft orbit and inclination, up to 700 observation targets, and any <b>geometric</b> <b>requirements</b> to be met. The primary output is the time per orbit that conditions are satisfied, with options for sky survey maps, time since a user-specified orbit event, and bar graphs illustrating overlapping requirements. The output is printed in visually convenient lineprinter form but is also available on data files for use by postprocessors such as external XY plotters. QUIKVIS is written in FORTRAN 77 for batch or interactive execution and has been implemented on a DEC VAX 11 / 780 operating under VMS with a central memory requirement of approximately 500 K of 8 bit bytes.

Refinement occurs predominantly by orientation splitting, micro and macroshear banding, and the <b>geometric</b> <b>requirement</b> for high angle boundary area to increase with strain. The deformation structure evolution is affected strongly by the processing route, die geometry, and material parameters. Both cell bands and microshear bands show strong alignment with the dies shear plane. Shear bands are promoted by changes in the shear plane orientation each extrusion cycle. At high strains a steady state is approached, where the grain size converges with the subgrain size, controlled by dynamic boundary migration...|$|R

40|$|Single-molecule nanodot arrays, {{in which}} a {{biomolecule}} of choice (protein, nucleic acid, etc.) is bound to a metallic nanoparticle on a solid substrate, are becoming an increasingly important tool {{in the study of}} biomolecular and cellular interactions. We have developed an on-chip measurement protocol to monitor and control the molecular occupancy of nanodots. Arrays of widely spaced nanodots and nanodot clusters were fabricated on glass surfaces by nanolithography and functionalized with fluorescently labeled proteins. The molecular occupancy was determined by monitoring individual fluorophore bleaching events, while accounting for fluorescence quenching effects. We found that the occupancy can be interpreted as a packing problem, and depends on nanodot size and binding ligand concentration, where the latter is easily adjusted to compensate the flexibility of dimension control in nanofabrication. The results are scalable with nanodot cluster size, extending to large area close packed arrays.

The TIRS instrument employs a refractive telescope design that is opaque to visible wavelengths making prelaunch geometric characterization challenging. TIRS geometric calibration thus {{relied heavily on}} on-orbit measurements. Since the two Landsat 8 payloads are complementary and generate combined Level 1 data products, the TIRS <b>geometric</b> performance <b>requirements</b> emphasize the co-alignment of the OLI and TIRS instrument fields of view and the registration of the OLI reflective bands to the TIRS long-wave infrared emissive bands. The TIRS on-orbit calibration procedures include measuring the TIRS-to-OLI alignment, refining the alignment of the three TIRS sensor chips, and ensuring the alignment of the two TIRS spectral bands. The two key TIRS performance metrics are the OLI reflective to TIRS emissive band registration accuracy, and the registration accuracy between the TIRS thermal bands.

40|$|In {{semiconductor}} manufacturing, {{the surface}} quality of silicon wafers {{has a significant}} impact on the subsequent processes that produce devices using the wafers as a component. The surface quality of a wafer is characterised by a two-dimensional (2 -D) data structure: the <b>geometric</b> <b>requirement</b> for the wafer surface is smooth and flat and the thickness should fall within certain specification limits. Therefore, both low deviation and high uniformity are desirable for control over the wafer quality. In this work, we develop a run-to-run control algorithm for improving wafer quality. Considering the unique 2 -D data structure, we first construct a model that encompasses the spatial correlation of the observations on the wafer surface to link the wafer quality with the process variables, and subsequently develop a recur-sive algorithm to generate optimal set points for the controllable factors. More specifically, a Gaussian-Kriging model is used to characterise the spatial dependence of the thickness measures of the wafer and a recursive least square method is employed to update the estimates of the model parameters. The performance of the new controller is studied via simula-tion and compared with existing controllers, which demonstrates that the newly proposed controller can effectively reduce the surface variations of the silicon wafers...|$|R

30|$|The {{proposed}} new parameter; thread tension being experimented using standard procedures for two main types of stitches namely lock-stitch 301 and chain-stitch 401. For both stitches, thread tension affects significantly in determination of thread consumption. In case of chain-stitch 401, there are combined effects of thread tensions together with fabric thickness and stitch density which determines accurate consumption values considering {{the properties of}} the stitch. The analysis of lock-stitch 301 shows a joint effect of thread tension and yarn count to the consumption of the needle thread. In comparison, inclusion of proposed thread tension variable depicts reduction in error percentages, so that the proposed formulae are expected to be a better approach to calculate thread consumption of lock-stitch 301 and chain-stitch 401. Once tension parameter is included in the formulae, apparel manufacturers need to optimize and measure the tension during garment pre-production stage as specified for the <b>geometric</b> <b>requirement</b> of the stitch. The average tension value set for a given stitch under selected stitch density can be measured using MLT Wesco tension meter and that figure need to be substituted in calculating the thread consumption.
