As the RMB has {{followed}} a remarkably predictable appreciation over time, I examine {{the price of}} Chinese exports to the USA after unpegging the exchange rate. Results suggest that the Chinese industries with greater import market share were able to raise their prices after {{the removal of the}} pegged exchange rate regime; however, over time there is a significant <b>deflationary</b> <b>trend.</b> Chinese export prices tended to decrease under an unanticipated RMB appreciation; this effect was more pronounced for industries with more pricing flexibility. This suggests that Chinese exporters are consistently "pricing to market" and thus creating a significant foreign exchange policy implication. Specifically, a more flexible exchange rate regime will likely have little impact on the prices of Chinese exports to the USA but might increase the profit volatility of Chinese firms.

40|$|When a {{formerly}} centrally {{planned economy}} frees prices and allows or compels producers to respond to market signals, conventional measures tend to severely overstate short-run output decline and inflation. The overstatement stems partly from neglect of private sector activity or belated recognition of inflation previously disguised as quality improvements. Even when individual prices and outputs are correctly measured, however, shifts in relative prices consequent to price decontrol create a serious aggregation problem. Moreover, standard indices ignore the <b>deflationary</b> <b>trends</b> in black markets. Theoretically superior indices are devised using a mixture of official and black market prices. ...|$|R
40|$|Continued <b>deflationary</b> <b>trends</b> in many markets {{around the}} world are {{creating}} greater pressure for cost reduction in order that margins can be maintained. Customers and consumers are increasingly value driven and consequently less brand or supplier loyal. In this challenging world, there is a growing recognition that creative pricing strategies combined with effective supply chain management provide opportunities for significant cost reduction and increased profits. This paper presents evidence to support this viewpoint and suggests an approach to supply chain alignment that can enable cost reduction opportunities to be identified and higher profits to be achieved through collaborative strategies...|$|R

Continental Europe, its agrarian output crippled {{by the recent}} war, offered new markets for American staple crops, particularly cotton, wheat, corn and tobacco. As prices soared for agricultural goods, a speculative agrarian land boom ensued in the South and West United States, encouraged by liberal terms for government public land sales. “The entire postwar American economy” observed historian George Dangerfield was “based on a land boom”. The inflationary bubble grew from 1815 to 1818, obscuring the general <b>deflationary</b> <b>trends</b> in world prices.|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} decade, {{the fall in}} {{worldwide}} inflation has raised interest in {{the risks associated with}} negative inflation, or deflation. What gave the issue an element of urgency was the long-lasting recession in Japan, which was accompanied by mild but persistent deflation and short-term nominal interest rates close to zero. In such an environment, cutting short-term interest rates, the usual remedy for weak demand, was just not an option. This survey reviews IMF research on how to counter weak demand at low interest rates. The first response of many economists to Japanese deflation was to suggest that the Bank of Japan simply print more money. It was believed that such a policy, sooner or later, would reverse the <b>deflationary</b> <b>trend</b> and stimulate demand. Over the years, however, while the Bank of Japan was printing money at an unprecedented rate, short-term interest rates were getting closer to zero, and the effect of money supply increases was modest at best. Since 1997, the Bank of Japan has more than doubled the economy’s monetary base. (continued on page 2...|$|E

Historical observations {{and the few}} measurements made before 1970 suggested a <b>deflationary</b> <b>trend.</b> Since 1969, the ground started to inflate during two major uplift episodes in 1969 - 72 and 1982 - 1985. We collected and reanalyzed all available punctual observations of vertical ground displacement taken in the period 1905 - 2009 with {{special attention to the}} period before 1969, to reconstruct in greater detail the deformation history of the caldera. We make use of the many photographs of the sea level in a roman ruin (the Serapeum Market) taken during the period between 1905 and 1969 to infer with more accuracy its relative height with respect to the sea level. We identify a previously disregarded major episode of ground uplift occurred between 1950 and 1952 with a maximum uplift of about 73 cm. This finding suggests that Campi Flegrei is currently experiencing a prolonged period of unrest longer than previously thought The higher seismicity associated with the later episodes of unrest suggests that the volcano has approached an instability threshold, which may eventually result in a volcanic eruption...|$|E
40|$|At {{a certain}} time after a {{long-term}} or very fast growth of asset prices, the asset price level seems to cease to reflect the development of fundamen-tals that should influence them. Such cases are called bubbles (asset price bubbles). A problem in the economy arises then the trend is inverted and the prices of the underlying assets fall sharply. In such a situation, the economy can incur great damages resulting from <b>deflationary</b> <b>trends.</b> The basic task of the central bank is to maintain price stability, therefore, it is also necessary to moni-tor the development of asset prices. Price bub-bles can emerge primarily in stock markets, com-modity markets and real estate markets. Since the first two market types are of global nature (cen...|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} meltdown since 2008 - 9 has created disinflation, and even deflation {{in some countries}} in the Euro-area, in a period with large debt overhang, creating the condition for a continuing financial market stress in the Euro-area. As disinflation and deflation push up the real interest rate, while growth and income declines, the leveraging problem becomes more severe and the economy risks shifting into a regime with high insolvency risk, high financial stress, rising credit spreads, possibly accompanied by strong adverse macroeconomic feedback loops. Investigating the consequences of those magnifying feedback loops, given the debt deflation, we demonstrate the possibility of unstable dynamics and downward spirals {{in the presence of}} regime-dependent macro feedback loops, using a theoretical model with decentralized matching mechanisms on both labor and financial markets. To explore the amplifying linkages between deflation, output, labor and financial markets, we employ a new solution procedure called NMPC to solve our models variants for out-of-steady-state dynamics. We empirically explore <b>deflationary</b> <b>trends</b> in Europe and employ a Global VAR (GVAR) model for a large euro area macro data set to estimate the impact of deflation on output. Moreover, we use a four variable Multi-Regime VAR (MRVAR) model with regime dependent IRs to study deflationary as well as well as the financial risk drivers in a MRVAR setting. New measures for financial risk drivers are employed and multi-regime IRs for output, inflation rates, interest rates and financial stress are explored. We also study regime changes in central macro relationships such as regime change in the credit - output link, the Phillips curve and in Okun's law...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} non-traditional {{monetary policy}} measures {{adopted by the}} Bank of Japan (BOJ) {{during the last two}} decades and by other G 7 central banks {{since the start of the}} current global financial turmoil and analyzes the effectiveness of such measures. The paper begins with a typology of policies usable near the zero lower bound on interest rates (ZLB). They are:(i) forward guidance of future policy rates;(ii) targeted asset purchases;(iii) and quantitative easing (QE). Using this typology, I review the measures adopted by the BOJ and other central banks. I then offer a news analysis of the effects of the measures adopted by the BOJ on asset prices, comparing them with those adopted by the Fed. Many of the measures, with the exception of strategy (iii), are shown to have moved asset prices in the expected directions. Another exception is that most of the monetary easing measures failed to weaken the yen. Despite some effects on asset prices, however, the measures have failed to stop the <b>deflationary</b> <b>trend</b> of the Japanese economy clearly. I discuss some possible reasons for this and more general implications for monetary policy. ...|$|E

In our benchmark model, we also find some tendency for the monetary authority to smooth nominal and real interest rates. Monetary policy...|$|E
40|$|The {{financial}} crisis in 2008 evidenced an over-simplification {{of the role}} of banks made in the majority of macroeconomic models. Based on Accounting System Dynamics (ASD) modeling approach, the current research presents a model that incorporates banks as creators of deposits when making loans as opposed to the conventional view of banks as intermediaries of existing money. The generic model thus developed consists of five sectors; production, household, banking, government and central bank to better understand interrelationships among five sectors and to explorer how monetary and production sector interact. The model turns out to produce diverse macroeconomic behaviors driven by interactions of reinforcing and balancing feedback loops. Some of them are: 1. Variability of money stock under stable base money due to endogenous deposit creation, 2. Short-term business cycles triggered by two different sources, 3. Temporary alleviation of GDP gap by monetary easing policy and its limitation for counteracting <b>deflationary</b> <b>trend,</b> 4. Different macroeconomic effects induced by the same fiscal policy implemented under different economic conditions, 5. Macroeconomic instabilities triggered by credit crunches and a shock in currency holding ratio. Simulation experiments under different scenarios highlight the importance of building a macroeconomic model where banks supply the majority of money stock. We believe that this generic ASD macroeconomic model of the stock approach could provide a foundation for actual macroeconomic analyses based on historical economic data...|$|E
