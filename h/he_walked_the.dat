According to a Cheyenne informant named White Elk, who was interviewed as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>the</b> battlefield 48 years after the event, the Indians had chosen 10 warriors as decoys to tempt Fetterman into the ambush: two Arapaho, two Cheyenne, and two {{from each of the}} three Lakota bands present: the Oglala, Brulé, and Miniconjou. Approximately three times as many Lakota participated in the battle as did Cheyenne and Arapaho. White Elk said there were more Indians present than at the Battle of the Little Bighorn, which would indicate an Indian force of considerably more than 1,000 men. Red Cloud was not present. Although Indian armies rarely had a single leader or a command structure, the most prominent leader was probably Hump (High Backbone), a Miniconjou.|$|E

Eudoxus was quite poor and could only afford an apartment at the Piraeus. To attend Plato's lectures, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>the</b> seven miles (11km) each direction, each day.

25|$|Game two {{was played}} {{two days later}} in Pittsburgh, and a {{highlight}} was Paige's dramatic showdown with Josh Gibson. In {{the bottom of the}} sixth, Paige relieved starter Hilton Smith with the Monarchs ahead 2–0. In the seventh inning, he gave up three singles and faced Gibson with the bases loaded and two outs. Gibson fouled off the first two pitches, then whiffed on the third. When Paige told the story in his autobiography, he mythologized the story. According to Paige, the strikeout came in the ninth inning with a one-run lead, and <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>the</b> three batters ahead of Gibson in order to face him. The mythical version was retold by Buck Leonard and Buck O'Neil in their memoirs. In the actual game, the Monarchs added three runs {{in the top of the}} eighth to take a 5–0 lead, then Paige gave up four in the bottom of the frame to make it 5–4.

25|$|The {{day before}} {{yesterday}} I was present at an operation performed by Dr. George McClellan, on a gentleman from Virginia. It consisted in {{the removal of the}} whole of the parotid gland in a scirrhous and much enlarged state, from {{the left side of the}} face. Nothing could exceed the combined coolness and skill manifested by Dr. M. throughout this terrible operation, which he has now performed for the eleventh time, and hitherto with remarkable success. On this occasion, however, he was doomed to disappointment, for the patient died last night, about thirty-six hours after the operation. McClellan sent for me in the evening, to see the dying man with him, and we met in the chamber of death between ten and eleven o'clock. I had sometimes heard McClellan spoken of as a heartless surgeon, devoid of feeling or sympathy for those who came under his knife; but I can solemnly aver that I have seldom witnessed more unaffected sorrow than he manifested on this occasion. <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>the</b> room incessantly, and repeatedly clasped my hands in his, while he expressed, in emphatic language, the feelings that preyed upon his mind. He moreover assured me, that he seldom performed one of his severer operations without first asking the blessing of God on his undertaking; and that days and nights of painful anxiety, often preceded those great professional efforts which have justly placed his name on the pinnacle of surgical fame. The gurgling respiration of the unfortunate patient announced the near approach of death, and I withdrew, full of sympathy for the agonized emotions of my friend.|$|E
25|$|Morrison {{was born}} in Geelong, Victoria, Australia. His father George Morrison (brother of Alexander Morrison) was {{headmaster}} of The Geelong College at which school he was educated. It was at The Geelong College that Morrison won a gold medal, in 1876, for Scripture History. The medal (5.4cm in diameter) is handcrafted and engraved by an unknown maker. The gold disc medal {{is surrounded by a}} chased Scottish Thistle and Oak wreath and attached with a blue ribbon. During a vacation, before his tertiary education, he walked from Geelong to Adelaide, a distance of about 600 miles (960km). He initially studied at the University of Melbourne. After passing his first year medicine he took a vacation trip down the Murray River in a canoe from Albury, New South Wales to the mouth, a distance of 1650 miles (2,640km), covered in 65 days. Bypassing his next examinations, Morrison shipped on a vessel trading to the South Sea islands, discovered some of the evils of the Kanaka traffic, and wrote articles on it which appeared in The Age and had some influence on the eventual suppression of it. He next visited New Guinea and did part of the return journey on a Chinese junk. Landing at Normanton, Queensland at the end of 1882 Morrison decided to walk to Melbourne. He was not quite 21, he had no horses or camels and was unarmed, but carrying his swag and swimming or wading the rivers in his path, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>the</b> 2043 miles (3270km) in 123 days. No doubt the country had been much opened up in the twenty years since Burke and Wills well-funded failure, but the journey was nevertheless a remarkable feat, which stamped Morrison as a great natural bushman and explorer. He arrived at Melbourne on 21 April 1883 to find that during his journey Thomas McIlwraith, the premier of Queensland, had annexed part of New Guinea, and was vainly endeavouring to get the support of the British government for his action.|$|E

500|$|Brenton was {{promoted}} to post-captain, and in March1800 Commander Lord Cochrane took over. Cochrane was less than impressed with his new command, declaring that Speedy was [...] "little more than a burlesque of a vessel of war".

On another occasion <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>the</b> quarterdeck with Speedys entire broadside, seven pieces of four-pounder shot, in his pockets. In an attempt to increase the firepower of his new command he asked for and was given two 12-pounder long guns to use as bow and stern chasers, but the scantlings could not support them {{and they had to}} be removed. He then requested his 4-pounders be upgraded to 6-pounders, but his gunports were not big enough. He had better luck with his mast, taking a spar from HMS Genereux that was considered too large for Speedy, but which Cochrane felt improved her speed.|$|E

The Deputy Minister of Information Bright Matonga accused Smith of being a racist, blamed him for the deaths of thousands and asserted that he would [...] "not be mourned or missed here by any decent person". Reactions from Zimbabweans on the street were mixed, however; according to Western journalists, many expressed sadness.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{evidence}} of considerable academic ability, Reed {{did not follow}} his brother Charles, who went on from the school to Trinity College, Cambridge. Instead, in 1869, Reed left the school to join the family firm, known as Sir Charles Reed & Sons or informally as the Fann Street Foundry, beginning a lifelong association with the printing trade. He found time, however, to pursue many other interests, physical, artistic and intellectual. Twice <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>the</b> [...] from London to Cambridge, each time leaving on Friday afternoon and arriving at St John's College for breakfast on Saturday. Reed was a competent swimmer, and won a Royal Humane Society medal for saving a cousin from drowning in rough seas. He was an accomplished pianist, a skilful pen-and-ink illustrator, and had an engaging style of writing. These artistic talents were put to service {{in the production of}} a family magazine, The Earlsfield Chronicle, which Reed edited (and largely wrote) from the mid-1870s. The magazine circulated only among the extended Reed family, and included serious articles ("Is total abstinence a moral duty?") alongside comic verses and cartoons.|$|E
500|$|After the {{assassination}} of Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968, Lindsay feared that rioting would occur in Harlem. He traveled to the neighborhood to express condolences; Clarence13X and his followers were among those who accompanied him as <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>the</b> streets. Clarence13X also instructed his followers {{to try to prevent}} violence and looting. He was commended by the city's leadership for his efforts, and they subsequently agreed to help him publish a book of Five Percenter teachings and portions of the Quran. Willieen Jowers recalled that Clarence13X admitted that his previous teachings about racial hatred were wrong around this time. He later described himself as [...] "neither anti-white nor pro-black" [...] and saw some of his white contacts with the city as allies in the advancement of his teachings. His white convert was released from state custody and joined his teacher in Harlem during the February 1969 nor'easter. He was accepted as a Five Percenter, as Clarence13X maintained that [...] "civilization"—rather than race—was valued by the group. Clarence13X made possibly contradictory statements about whether white individuals could be reformed. Contrary to his radical reputation, he endorsed some conservative positions in the late 1960s, including capital punishment, respect for the U.S. flag, and American involvement in Vietnam. He also allowed his supporters to attend Christmas celebrations. Knight notes that these shifts may have been intended to decrease suspicions of law enforcement. Clarence13X was then allowed to visit a juvenile detention center to speak to young Five Percenters and won some concessions from the institution's leadership. Some secular black leaders disliked him, owing to his supportive comments about the mayor and neglect of revolutionary rhetoric. On one occasion, he was invited to address an audience of black Marxists, then spoke to them about numerology.|$|E
