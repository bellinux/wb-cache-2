5|$|Many other oxyanions form complexes; {{these include}} copper(II) acetate, copper(II) nitrate, and copper(II) carbonate. Copper(II) sulfate forms a blue {{crystalline}} pentahydrate, {{the most familiar}} copper compound in the laboratory. It is used in a <b>fungicide</b> called the Bordeaux mixture.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{protective}} {{measures have been}} implemented, including site access restrictions, the collection and cold-storage of seed, and the treatment of plants with phosphite. Phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct <b>fungicide.</b> Aerial spraying of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed {{as studies have shown}} that foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth. Direct injection of phosphite into the stem of each tree appears to lack this disadvantage, but is costly to administer and restricted to known plants.|$|E
50|$|When {{spraying}} <b>fungicides</b> Quilt and Headline EC at 6 oz/a at tassel stage using a tractor-mounted CO2 powered sprayer using 20 {{gallons of}} water/acre, average yield {{was seen to}} increase. The use of <b>fungicides</b> can be both economically and environmentally costly and should only be applied on susceptible varieties and large-scale corn production. In order to prevent fungal resistance to <b>fungicides,</b> all <b>fungicides</b> are to be used alternatively, switching <b>fungicides</b> with different modes of action. Pyraclostrobin (Headline EC) and azoxystrobin are Quinone outside Inhibitor (QoI) <b>fungicides,</b> whereas propiconazole and prothioconazole are DeMethylation Inhibitors (DMI) <b>fungicides.</b>|$|R

5|$|Nitrogen {{fixation}} {{plays an}} important role in the nitrogen cycle. Azotobacter also synthesizes some biologically active substances, including some phytohormones such as auxins, thereby stimulating plant growth. They also facilitate the mobility of heavy metals in the soil, thus enhancing bioremediation of soil from heavy metals, such as cadmium, mercury and lead. Some kinds of Azotobacter can also biodegrade chlorine-containing aromatic compounds, such as 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, which was previously used as an insecticide, <b>fungicide,</b> and herbicide, but later was found to have mutagenic and carcinogenic effects.|$|E
5|$|Banksia verticillata {{has been}} {{declared}} vulnerable under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, and Rare under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. A 1995 census yielded an estimated total population size of 4500 plants. Apart from dieback and aerial canker, frequency of bushfires and illegal picking have been cited as threats. Ongoing management includes monitoring of current populations, gathering more data on best response to fire, and restricting access to populations. Seed has been collected from many populations, but germination rates after ten years of storage are much lower than in Banksia brownii. Translocation is considered an option in the future, as is spraying with phosphite, particularly {{in the vicinity of}} Walpole. Used successfully on B.brownii but as yet untrialled with B.verticillata, phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct <b>fungicide.</b> Aerial spraying of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed as studies have shown that foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth.|$|E
5|$|Using a {{standard}} laboratory method to determine antimicrobial susceptibility, methanol-based extracts of Strobilurus tenacellus fruit bodies were {{shown in a}} 2000 study to have low antibacterial activity against the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, and low to moderate activity against the fungi Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus. The fungus produces the natural antibiotic strobilurinA, which was reported as a novel compound from this species in 1977; other strobilurins have since been found in other basidiomycete wood-rotting fungi, like Porcelain Mushroom for example. StrobilurinA {{is thought to be}} derived biosynthetically from the amino acid L-phenylalanine. In nature, the fungus secretes the chemical to prevent invasion by other fungi that challenge its nutrient source. It works by blocking electron transfer in the mitochondria, stopping respiration by binding to the ubihydroquinone oxidation center of the bc1 complex. This prevents the competing fungus from creating its own energy and inhibiting its growth at the earliest stages of the life cycle, the spore germination stage. The fungus is resistant to its own chemical because its ubihydroquinone has three amino acid residues that prevent the strobilurins from binding. Because of their sensitivity to light, and high vapor pressures that causes them to rapidly disappear when applied to the surface of a leaf, chemically unmodified strobilurins are not generally useful as fungicides for agricultural use. The strobilurin-derived compound azoxystrobin, ﬁrst made commercially available in 1996, was designed to overcome these limitations. It is the world's biggest-selling <b>fungicide.</b> Other commercial fungicides developed from the strobilurins include Allegro, and Brio (kresoxim-methyl) Amistar.|$|E
40|$|<b>Fungicides</b> are {{regularly}} applied in horticultural production systems and may migrate off-site, potentially posing an ecological risk to surface waterways. However, {{few studies have}} investigated the fate of <b>fungicides</b> in horticultural catchments. This study investigated the presence of 24 <b>fungicides</b> at 18 sites during a 5 -month period within a horticultural catchment in southeastern Australia. Seventeen of the 24 <b>fungicides</b> were detected in the waterways, with <b>fungicides</b> detected in 63 % of spot water samples, 44 % of surface sediment samples, and 44 % of the passive sampler systems deployed. One third of the water samples contained residues {{of two or more}} <b>fungicides.</b> Myclobutanil, trifloxystrobin, pyrimethanil, difenoconazole, and metalaxyl were the <b>fungicides</b> most frequently detected, being present in 16 - 38 % of the spot water samples. Iprodione, myclobutanil, pyrimethanil, cyproconazole, trifloxystrobin, and fenarimol were found at the highest concentrations in the water samples ([0. 2 lg/l). Relatively high concentrations of myclobutanil and pyrimethanil (C 120 lg/kg dry weight) were detected in the sediment samples. Generally the concentrations of the <b>fungicides</b> detected were several orders of magnitude lower than reported ecotoxicological effect values, suggesting that concentrations of individual <b>fungicides</b> in the catchment were unlikely to pose an ecological risk. However, there is little information on the effects of <b>fungicides,</b> especially fungi and microbes, on aquatic ecosystems. There is also little known about the combined effects of simultaneous low-level exposure of multiple <b>fungicides</b> to aquatic organisms.

25|$|In Ghana, a {{study that}} {{combined}} the sanitation and <b>fungicide</b> application showed {{a significant reduction in}} the percentage of disease incidence, where greater black pod incident were observed from pods on the trunk than the canopy in control treatment (no <b>fungicide</b> application). This suggested that the application of <b>fungicide</b> on the trunk would protect pods from infection, therefore reduce primary and secondary infection rate, both on the trunk and in the canopy. In addition, the application of systemic (potassium phosphonate) with one and double injection (20 ml and 40 ml of <b>fungicide</b> for each injection frequency), and semi-systemic (metalaxyl) <b>fungicide</b> showed better control compared to contact fungicides (copper based <b>fungicide)</b> in both locations that were used in the experiment.|$|E
25|$|The {{recommended}} {{standard for}} <b>fungicide</b> application to control black pod disease caused by P. megakarya {{for a season}} is 6 to 8 times of application in every 3–4 weeks. However, the adoption of recommended application was very low among farmers in Ghana. Therefore, an experiment with a reduced number of <b>fungicide</b> applications demonstrated that there was 25 to 45% reduction in disease incidence. In terms of disease control and yields, sanitation and three applications of Ridomil 72 plus (12% metalaxyl + 60% copper-1-oxide) <b>fungicide</b> showed a better control compared to sanitation alone and sanitation {{with one or two}} <b>fungicide</b> applications. However, reduced in <b>fungicide</b> application was shown to be significantly less effective than the recommended standard <b>fungicide</b> application.|$|E
