50|$|The rope is the {{defining}} characteristic of an elevated passenger ropeway. The rope stretches and contracts as the tension exerted upon it increases and decreases, and it bends and flexes as it passes over sheaves and around the bullwheels. The <b>fibre</b> <b>core</b> contains a lubricant which protects the rope from corrosion and also allows for smooth flexing operation. The rope must be regularly lubricated to ensure safe operation and long life.|$|E
40|$|The {{transmission}} {{function of}} twin <b>core</b> <b>fibre</b> {{is determined by}} his fibre length and coupling length if only one of its cores is excited. For design of attenuation components or sensors it is useful known transmission dependence twin <b>core</b> <b>fibres</b> on coupling length variations, because the coupling length depends on difference of effective propagation phase constants appertaining to particular <b>fibre</b> <b>cores.</b> It is possible to change tham by such deformation, which influences the difference of effective phase constants. For this purpose twin <b>core</b> <b>fibres</b> with one <b>core</b> in the centre of fibre are applicable. The simple deformation of fibre in torsion changes the length (and also effective propagation phase constant) of core located out of centre of fibre.

Their agreement (or disagreement) with description following from theory may be possible indication of eventual misalignment of cores what is important for design of attenuation components with control attenuation or sensors...|$|R

50|$|Fibre bundles were {{originally}} developed {{for use in}} flexible endoscopes. and have since been adapted for use in endomicroscopy. They consist {{of a large number}} (up to tens of thousands) of <b>fibre</b> <b>cores</b> inside a single shared cladding, are flexible, and have diameters on the order of a millimetre. In a coherent fibre bundle the relative positions of the cores are maintained along the fibre, meaning that an image projected onto one end of the bundle will be transferred to the other end without scrambling. Therefore, if one end of the bundle is placed at the focus of a table-top confocal microscope, the bundle will act as a flexible extension and allow endoscopic operation.Since only the cores, and not the cladding, transmit light, image processing must be applied to remove the resulting honeycomb-like appearance of the images. Each core essentially acts as an image pixel, and so the spacing between <b>fibre</b> <b>cores</b> limits the resolution. The addition of micro-optics at the distal tip of the bundle allows for magnification and hence higher resolution imaging, but at the cost of reducing the field-of-view.|$|R
50|$|Chemical pulping dissolves the lignin that bonds fibres to one another, and binds {{the outer}} fibrils that compose {{individual}} fibres to the <b>fibre</b> <b>core.</b> Lignin, {{like most other}} substances that can separate fibres from one another, acts as a debonding agent, lowering strength. Strength also depends on maintaining long cellulose molecule chains. The kraft process, due to the alkali and sulphur compounds used, tends to minimize attack on the cellulose and the non-crystalline hemicellulose, which promotes bonding, while dissolving the lignin. Acidic pulping processes shorten the cellulose chains.|$|E
50|$|A fibre-optic cable {{can be used}} {{to detect}} intruders by {{measuring}} the difference in the amount of light sent through the <b>fibre</b> <b>core.</b> If the cable is disturbed, light will 'leak' out and the receiver unit will detect a difference in the amount of light received. The cable can be attached directly to a chainwire fence or bonded into a barbed steel tape that is used to protect the tops of walls and fences. This type of barbed tape provides a good physical deterrent as well as giving an immediate alarm if the tape is cut or severely distorted. Other types work on the detection of change in polarization which is caused by fiber position change.|$|E
50|$|Stranded ropes are an {{assembly}} of several strands laid helically {{in one or}} more layers around a core. This core can be one of three types. The first is a fiber core, made up of synthetic material or natural fibers like Sysal. Synthetic fibers are stronger and more uniform but can't absorb much lubricant, natural fibers can absorb up to 15% of their weight in lubricant and so protect the inner wires much better from corrosion than synthetic fibers do. Fiber cores are the most flexible and elastic, but have the downside of getting crushed easily. The second type, wire strand core, is made up of one additional strand of wire, and is typically used for suspension. The third type is independent wire rope core (IWRC), which is the most durable in all types of environments. Most types of stranded ropes only have one strand layer over the core (<b>fibre</b> <b>core</b> or steel core). The lay direction of the strands in the rope can be right (symbol Z) or left (symbol S) and the lay direction of the wires can be right (symbol z) or left (symbol s). This kind of rope is called ordinary lay rope if the lay direction of the wires in the outer strands is in the opposite direction to the lay of the outer strands themselves. If both the wires in the outer strands and the outer strands themselves have the same lay direction, the rope is called a lang lay rope (formerly Albert’s lay or Lang’s lay). Regular lay means the individual wires were wrapped around the centers in one direction and the strands were wrapped around the core in the opposite direction.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of {{photonic crystal fibre}} from conventional optical fibre follows a trend in the {{development of}} materials, to create composites and structured materials on smaller and smaller scales. In fact the great success of photonic crystal fibre is largely due to the ability to structure it on scales comparable to the wavelength of light. It is this micron size structure that allows the creation of an (out of plane) optical bandgap in silica and allows hollow <b>core</b> <b>fibre</b> to guide light in an air core freeing the guided mode from the properties of bulk silica. This thesis focuses on the propagation and compression of high peak power optical solitons in hollow <b>core</b> <b>fibre.</b> As the Kerr nonlinear response of air is approximately a thousand times less than that of silica, the air core of hollow <b>core</b> <b>fibre</b> can support much higher peak powers than conventional optical fibre without the manifestation of nonlinear effects, making it ideal for the delivery of high peak power laser pulses. Coupled with this, hollow <b>core</b> <b>fibre</b> has a large region of anomalous dispersion in its transmission window allowing optical pulses to be transmitted as temporal solitons freeing them from the effects of dispersion. The author started his Ph. D. in 2006, three years after the first demonstration of soliton propagation in hollow <b>core</b> <b>fibre</b> and as the first demonstrations of soliton compression in hollow <b>core</b> <b>fibre</b> were being undertaken. Work by the author to build upon these early demonstrations is presented in this thesis in the following manner: Chapters 1, 2 and 3 are theory chapters. Chapter 1 explains the background waveguide theory and theory of nonlinear optics that is used throughout the thesis. Chapter 2 details the properties of photonic crystal fibres focusing on hollow <b>core</b> <b>fibre.</b> Chapter 3 details recent papers relevant to the propagation and compression of solitons in hollow <b>core</b> <b>fibre.</b> Chapters 4, 5 and 6 are experimental chapters reporting work undertaken by the author. Chapter 4 focuses on modifying the nonlinearity of hollow <b>core</b> <b>fibre</b> and measuring the dispersion of hollow <b>core</b> <b>fibre</b> accurately. Chapter 5 focuses on the compression of chirped and unchirped picosecond pulses in dispersion decreasing hollow <b>core</b> <b>fibre</b> tapers.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that a {{sinusoidal}} signal wave can transform into a cnoidal (periodic) wave in an optical fibre if the power signal propagates in the <b>fibre</b> <b>core.</b> In this case the signal wave period increases, but the wave profile does not almost change. The signal wave gets the form of kink for the high-power signal. The wave transformation is determined by nonlinear effects in the <b>fibre</b> <b>core.</b> The lin-ear modes of the fibre transform into the nonlinear ones under influence of cubic or higher nonlinear interactions of electromagnetic and polarization waves.

40|$|Reflections at {{wavelengths}} {{other than}} the expected harmonics of phase-mask-written fibre Bragg gratings (FBGs) have been observed.

40|$|Amongst {{the most}} {{important}} and frequently used fibre devices, fibre Bragg and long-period gratings are conventionally fabricated by low-intensity (I < 107 W cm− 2) UV quanta with an energy of about 5 eV, which coincides with the maximum of the absorption band of defects in germanosilicate glass (the usual material of a <b>fibre</b> <b>core).</b> Such a single-quantum photochemical technique produces refractive index changes in the <b>fibre</b> <b>core</b> and not in the fibre cladding. The use of single-quantum excitation with high-energy vacuum UV photons with 157 nm wavelength or two-quantum 193 nm excitation through the real intermediate state results in a higher excitation energy (7. 9 and 12. 8 eV, respectively) and significantly increases the efficiency of grating inscription.
