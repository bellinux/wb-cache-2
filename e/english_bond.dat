5|$|The plan of {{the house}} is unusual, partly because of its {{incorporation}} of the earlier building; it extends at right angles to the primary (southern) façade. The elevations are symmetrical, facing outwards, but the interior court is narrow, and projecting wings lie {{at either end of the}} eastern and western sides. Bramshill House is three storeys high on the southern main entrance side and two storeys high to the north and east. There are three vaulted cellars to the west. The house is built of red brick laid in <b>English</b> <b>bond</b> dressed with stone, with ashlar quoining at the corners of the wings. Stone dressings are featured on numerous large mullion windows. An open carved parapet surmounts the building. The roof consists of red tiles, and there are large gables on the west side. The chimney stacks are rectangular.|$|E
5|$|At Langport, the Great Bow Bridge, {{which now}} carries the A378, is a three-arched bridge, {{constructed}} {{under the terms}} of the Parrett Navigation Act of 1836. Completed in 1841 at a cost of £3,749, it replaced the previous medieval bridge, with its nine tiny arches, all too small to allow navigation. A bridge at this site was first mentioned in 1220. The medieval bridge consisted of a total of 31 arches, of which nine crossed the river, and 19 of the original arches were located by ground-penetrating radar in 1987, buried beneath the road which runs from Great Bow Bridge to Little Bow Bridge. The Warehouse in Langport was built in the late 18th century of <b>English</b> <b>bond</b> red brick, with Flemish bond extensions. It has clay plain tile roofs with hipped ends. It was built by the Parrett Navigation Company, a trading company owned by Vincent Stuckey and Walter Bagehot, on the banks of the River. When the river became unnavigable, the building was no longer needed, and it was eventually abandoned. The Somerset Trust for Sustainable Development, which became the Ecos Trust, purchased the site, designated as a brown field site, in February 2003, and worked with Somerset Buildings Preservation Trust, English Heritage and local councils to redevelop it into a craft, heritage learning and small business centre, with the surrounding land being used for an eco-friendly housing development. It is a grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} listed residences in Dunham Massey, most {{dating from the}} 18th or early-19th century, and many feature Flemish bond {{brickwork}} and slate roofs. They include: Dunham Massey Lodge, on Dunham Road; Willow Cottage; numbers 1 and 2 Barns Lane; number 1 Orchard View; The Hollies, on Station Road; numbers 1, 3 and 4 Woodhouse Lane; Big Tree Cottages, on Woodhouse Lane. Agden View, also on Woodhouse Lane, dates from 1725 and has both garden wall bond and Flemish bond brickwork. Big Tree House, on Charcoal Road, dates from the mid-18th century and features <b>English</b> <b>bond</b> brickwork. Yew Tree Cottage and Lime Tree Cottage are also on Charcoal Lane; both houses date to the 17th century and exhibit garden wall bond brickwork with slate roofs. Ivy House, on Woodhouse Lane, {{was built in the}} early 18th century. Kitchen Garden cottage was built in 1702. Rose Cottage and Farm Cottage are late-18th- or early-19th-century. The Meadows, on School Lane, was built in the 17th century and features garden wall bond brickwork and a thatched roof.|$|E
25|$|Domestically, the colectivo is {{also called}} bondi; the word {{comes from the}} name of Rio de Janeiro's tramways (bondes), in turn from <b>English</b> <b>bonds,</b> which is how the {{government}} paid for the Rio tramway system to the British company that built it.|$|R

25|$|Heslington Hall is a Grade II* listed rebuilt {{manor house}} {{consisting}} of a central nine bay two-storey block with attics and two two-storey wings at each end. It is built of brick in <b>English</b> <b>bond</b> with sandstone ashlar dressings. The original Manor house was constructed in 1568 for Sir Thomas Eynns, the Secretary and Keeper of the Seal to the Council of the North; and his wife Elizabeth.|$|E
25|$|The firehouse is {{a three-story}} building, three bays wide by four deep, on a half-acre (2,000 m²) lot in {{downtown}} Tivoli. It is faced in brick laid in <b>English</b> <b>bond</b> with contrasting stone {{courses at the}} floor levels. The hipped slate roof is pierced by a dormer with gabled parapet top, four chimneys and a round turreted tower rising from the southwest corner. The roofline's cornice is broken in front by the dormer.|$|E

25|$|For the {{standard}} <b>English</b> garden wall <b>bond,</b> headers {{are used as}} quoins for the middle stretching course in order to generate the lap, with queen closers as the penultimate brick {{at either end of}} the heading courses. A more complex set of quoins and queen closers is necessary to achieve the lap for a raking <b>English</b> garden wall <b>bond.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{initial and}} {{defining}} {{parts of the}} college were designed by Alfred Waterhouse: The architect built the main site with the Old Wing, the Hospital Wing, the Orchard Wing, the Stanley library and Old Kitchens between 1873 and 1886, {{as well as the}} parapetted gatehouse tower in 1886 and 1887. The red brick design (<b>English</b> <b>bond)</b> is typical of Victorian architecture, and is enhanced by black mortar courses and terracotta details to the eaves, windows and doorways. The roofs are steeply pitched with crested tiles. In 1913, the site consisted of 33 acres.|$|E
25|$|This bond has {{alternating}} {{stretching and}} heading courses, with the headers centred over {{the midpoint of}} the stretchers, and perpends in each alternate course aligned. Queen closers appear as the second brick, and the penultimate brick in heading courses. A muted colour scheme for occasional headers is sometimes used in <b>English</b> <b>bond</b> to lend a subtle texture to the brickwork. Examples of such schemes include blue-grey headers among otherwise red bricks—seen in the south of England—and light brown headers in a dark brown wall, more often found in parts of the north of England.|$|E
25|$|Inigo Jones {{had brought}} the {{classical}} renaissance style to England in the early 17th century. His followers took the new classical style into the country, characterised by its symmetry and proportion and such classical elements as pilasters, while wide eaves took {{the place of a}} cornice. Often a bricklayer would also be the principal contractor, controlling the other trades, and he could avoid the necessity to employ a mason for stonework if he could produce the classical elements in brick. So in this house we have brick pilasters, one above the other, with capitals and bases shaped in brickwork. The rebuilding seems to have been carried out in two stages, though without a long gap between them. There is a straight joint in the brickwork {{to the left of the}} second pilaster on the north side. In front of this the bricks are laid in <b>English</b> <b>bond,</b> but Flemish bond is used towards the back, indicating that this part was built a little later.|$|E
5000|$|The L-shaped {{house was}} built in the late 16th century and {{comprises}} the south and west wings of an incomplete E-shaped house, the north wing not being built apart from the first few courses of brickwork. It is constructed largely of <b>English</b> <b>bonded</b> red brick with a tiled roof and is a two-storey house with an attic roof featuring storey-height dormer windows. Door and window surrounds are of stone and window frames are timber. The walls are detailed with a rendered string course and projecting brickwork banding between the ground and first floors, a string course with decorative brickwork above the first floor and a cornice above the dormers.|$|R

50|$|Hamptworth Lodge is {{a country}} house built in 1912 in the Tudor style, to designs of Sir Guy Dawber. It was built to replace a seventeenth century building, parts {{of which have been}} {{incorporated}} into the present structure. It is constructed of Flemish bond brick with timber-framing and has a tiled roof and ornamental brick chimney stacks. The house is Grade II* listed. A much older house {{is to be found in}} Whiteparish Moore Lane, about 1+3/4 mi northwest of Hamptworth: a country house called Newhouse which was built in 1619. It is constructed from <b>English</b> <b>bonded</b> brick with limestone dressings and has a tiled roof and brick chimney stacks. It is a Grade I listed building.|$|R
500|$|The {{house is}} built in an [...] "H" [...] shape {{with a central}} section flanked by four {{projecting}} wings. Swakeleys was built of <b>English</b> <b>Bond</b> brick, with its windows framed with stone. Several of the exterior rain-water heads show the year construction was completed along with the initials [...] "E.W." [...] for Sir Edmund Wright. To {{the west of the}} house, a large lawn stretches out to what is now known as Swakeleys Lake. The main routes leading to the house have since become the residential streets Swakeleys Road (then Back Lane), The Grove and The Avenue.|$|E
500|$|On {{the western}} side, {{the first part}} of the County Hall was built in 1935, and is known as [...] "A Block". It was {{designed}} by Vincent Harris, and is Neo-Georgian. It is a three storey, built out of red and buff-coloured bricks forming an <b>English</b> <b>bond,</b> with Portland stone dressings. The central section is curved, with wings at 45 degrees to the formed main entrance. The ground-floor is fronted with ashlar, and has three round arches, the middle one of which forms a doorway. The doorway is topped by an engraved coat of arms in the tympanum. The central block spans nine windows, while each wing has a prominent window at the end, framed by an aedicule. The first and second floors of the wings feature eleven sash windows. An extension was made to the south of the building in the 1960s. The original [...] "A Block" [...] is designated as a Grade II listed building.|$|E
500|$|The four locks at Wootton Rivers {{mark the}} end of the climb from the Avon. Between Wootton Top Lock and Crofton is the summit pound of the canal at [...] above sea level, {{stretching}} for about [...] and including the [...] Bruce Tunnel. The tunnel is named after the local land owner, Thomas Brudenell-Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury (1729–1814), who refused to allow a deep cutting through his property and insisted on a tunnel. The tunnel has red brick portals, capped with Bath stone, each with a decorative plaque of Pennant stone. The tunnel was begun in 1806 and finished in 1809. It is lined with <b>English</b> <b>bond</b> brickwork and has a wide bore to cope with the Newbury barges used on the canal. There is no towpath through the tunnel, so walkers and cyclists must walk {{across the top of the}} hill. When canal boats were pulled by horses the boatmen had to haul their barges through the tunnel by hand, pulling on chains that ran along the inside walls.|$|E
25|$|This bond {{is exactly}} like <b>English</b> cross <b>bond</b> {{except in the}} {{generating}} of the lap at the quoins. In Dutch bond, all quoins are three-quarter bats—placed in alternately stretching and heading orientation with successive courses—and no use whatever is made of queen closers.|$|R
50|$|Early {{fabric that}} survives include the {{majority}} of the perimeter walls which are constructed of <b>English</b> <b>bonded</b> brickwork. These walls have arrised corners to openings and engaged piers in the form of bull nosed brickwork to prevent injury. Several of the original openings in external walls are apparent including the bricked in windows to the Petrie Terrace elevation which correspond and provide evidence of the location of the stalls and loose boxes that were positioned along that elevation. Other elements include the roof structure of substantial timber trusses and large timber framed louvred ventilators to each of the ridges. The timber posts supporting the trusses to the central wing demonstrate where the former stalls and timber partition walls were located.|$|R

2500|$|The {{brickwork}} {{is typical}} of Virginia colonial churches in being laid with a water table, a section standing on the foundation, a brick’s length wider than the walls that are nineteen inches thick. [...] The transition from the water table to the walls is made with an ovolo, a convex ¼ round, molded brick. As is the custom, <b>English</b> <b>bond</b> is present {{on all of the}} water table. The walls, however, are varied in their brickwork with some sections being laid in Flemish bond, other sections in <b>English</b> <b>bond,</b> and still other sections in irregular, mixed bond. Flemish bond is used regularly on the porch and most of the south wall. <b>English</b> <b>bond</b> is used on the upper eastern part of the south wall, the east and west gables, two sections of the north wall and the chancel wall. The north wing is a mixture of Flemish and irregular bonds. Glazed headers are used with some regularity in the walls as is typical with Flemish bond, but some sections show an irregular use of this feature also ...|$|E

2500|$|This bond {{also has}} {{alternating}} stretching and heading courses. [...] However, whilst the heading courses are identical with {{those found in}} the standard <b>English</b> <b>bond,</b> the stretching courses alternate between a course composed entirely of stretchers, and a course composed of stretchers half off-set relative to the stretchers two courses above or below, by reason of a header placed just before the quoins at either end. The bond is widely found in Northern France, Belgium and the Netherlands.|$|E
