50|$|<b>Dot</b> <b>maps</b> use {{one single}} dot to {{represent}} where a single phenomenon {{is the most}} likely to occur. The total amount of dots can cover a single area or multiple areas.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from June 26, 2015 - June 26, 2017 Dot mapping is a traditional method for visualizing quantitative data, but current automated dot mapping techniques are limited. The most common automated method places dots pseudo-randomly within enumeration areas, which can result in overlapping dots and very dense dot clusters for areas with large values. These issues affect users’ ability to estimate values. Graduated <b>dot</b> <b>maps</b> use dots with different sizes that represent different values. With graduated <b>dot</b> <b>maps</b> the number of dots on a map is smaller {{and the likelihood of}} overlapping dots is smaller. This research introduces an automated method of generating graduated <b>dot</b> <b>maps</b> that arranges dots with blue noise patterns to avoid overlapping dots and uses clustering algorithms to replace densely-packed dots with dots of larger sizes. A user study comparing graduated <b>dot</b> <b>maps,</b> pseudo-random <b>dot</b> <b>maps,</b> blue noise <b>dot</b> <b>maps,</b> and area-proportional circle maps with almost 300 participants was conducted. Results indicate that map-users can interpret graduated <b>dot</b> <b>maps</b> more accurately than the other map types. In addition, map users appear to prefer graduated <b>dot</b> <b>maps</b> to the other map types. These findings suggest that graduated <b>dot</b> <b>maps</b> are more effective and more appealing than conventional <b>dot</b> <b>maps...</b>|$|E
40|$|We used computer-generated <b>dot</b> <b>maps</b> {{to examine}} the spatial {{distribution}} of 94 Toxoplasma gondi infections associated with an outbreak in British Columbia, Canada. The incidence among patients served by one water distribution system was 3. 52 times that of patients served by other sources.

Epidemiologists have traditionally used maps {{to examine the}} spatial distribution of disease incidence. Computer-generated <b>dot</b> <b>maps</b> have facilitated identification of case clusters (1), formulation of hypotheses about the source of infection or spatially distributed risk factors (2, 3), and analysis of data.

40|$|<b>Dot</b> <b>maps</b> {{have become}} a popular way to {{visualize}} discrete geographic data. Yet, beyond showing how the data is spatially distributed, <b>dot</b> <b>maps</b> are often visually cluttered in terms of consistency, overlap and representativeness. Existing clutter reduction techniques like jittering, refinement, distortion and aggregation also address this issue, but do so by arbitrarily displacing dots from their exact location, removing dots from the map, changing the spatial reference of the map, or reducing its level of detail, respectively. We present BinSq, a novel visualization technique to compare variations in dot density patterns without visual clutter. Based on a careful synthesis of existing clutter reduction techniques, BinSq reduces {{the wide variety of}} dot density variations on the map to a representative subset of density intervals that are more distinguishable. The subset is derived from a nested binning operation that introduces order and regularity to the map. Thereafter, a dot prioritization operation improves the representativeness of the map by equalizing visible data values to correspond with the actual data. In this paper, we describe the algorithmic implementation of BinSq, explore its parametric design space, and discuss its capabilities in comparison to six existing clutter reduction techniques for <b>dot</b> <b>maps.</b> status: accepte...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 118 - 123) Very {{little work}} has been done by cartographers toward a precise description of how map users perceive numerousness on <b>dot</b> <b>maps.</b> This study, in order to investigate some of the problems in this area, incorporated three tests designed to examine the perceptual characteristics of <b>dot</b> <b>maps</b> in general along with the effects of anchors (legends), variable dot size, and selected figure-ground relationships. In addition, a fourth test was carried out to detect possible design bias in the first three tests and to measure the effect of the subjects' backgrounds on previous results. All of the tests in this study consisted of <b>dot</b> <b>maps</b> designed and executed to have characteristics similar to those commonly used in geographic study. Subjects were given these maps and asked to estimate dot numbers in selected areas. The results of these tests indicated that in general people underestimate dot numbers and are relatively insensitive to variation in density. Anchors, along with dot sizes smaller than those normally employed and lightly tinted base data were all found to improve perceptual accuracy. The fourth test detected little design bias in the first three tests and established that the perceptual characteristics of various populations are very similar when divided along lines of class rank or area of study...|$|E

In a sense, a thematic map is the spatial analyst's equivalent to the scatterplot in nonspatial analysis. This paper presents the tmap package, a set of Stata programs designed to draw five kinds of thematic maps: choropleth, proportional symbol, deviation, <b>dot,</b> and label <b>maps.</b> The first three kinds of maps are intended to depict area data, the fourth is suitable for representing point data, and the fifth can be used to show data of both types.

40|$|The present paper {{analyzed}} {{the perception of}} spatial dispersion {{in the distribution of}} point objects. Spatial dispersion {{is one of the major}} concepts communicated by <b>dot</b> <b>maps.</b> To promote efficient communication of this concept, two experiments were conducted for investigating the relationship between the perception of spatial dispersion and the following map characteristics: spatial arrangement of points, number of points, symbol size, and map scale. Regression models were then built on the basis of the experiment results to describe the relationship quantitatively. The obtained models enable map authors to predict the degree of spatial dispersion perceived by map readers. From the models and the results of a computer-assisted simulation, the following conclusions were obtained: 1) map scale greatly affects the perception of spatial dispersion, 2) spatial arrangement of points and number of points are also influential, 3) the size of point Maps showing the distribution of point objects, which are often called <b>dot</b> <b>maps,</b> are fundamental tools for visualizing the spatial pattern of points.
