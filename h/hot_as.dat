5|$|Belief that Cooper did {{not survive}} was bolstered {{by the fact that}} none of the money has ever been used. A {{quantity}} was found under riverbank silt, but its location is not consistent with Cooper dying or losing the ransom in the jump. This, combined with the knowledge that with law enforcement involved, a ransom would in effect be 100% bait money (a fact known to the public since the trial following the Lindbergh kidnapping) makes it less likely that Cooper had any intention of actually using the ransom money. A minority opinion is that a North American of Cooper's apparent sophistication could hardly have expected to spend or fence currency as <b>hot</b> <b>as</b> the ransom would predictably be, and he had carried out a planned dumping of the money before disappearing.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Ishikawa {{signed with}} the Milwaukee Brewers, who used him mainly as a pinch-hitter and {{defensive}} replacement. Ishikawa spent most of 2013 in the minor leagues, though he played six games for the Baltimore Orioles and one game for the New York Yankees. In 2014, he made the Pittsburgh Pirates Opening Day roster. However his bat wasn't as <b>hot</b> <b>as</b> it was during Spring Training so the Pirates traded for 1B Ike Davis from the New York Mets and Ishikawa was designated for assignment. He was re-signed by his former team the San Francisco Giants in April and started for them in left field during the 2014 playoffs. On October 16, 2014, Ishikawa hit a walk-off three-run home run to give the Giants their third National League pennant in five years by defeating the St. Louis Cardinals.|$|E
5|$|In some instances, the {{production}} of analogue pizza cheese can be similar to {{the production}} of cream cheese, although production may be different and homogenization may be avoided. In some varieties, the product is heated to remain at a specific temperature and for a specific amount of time, which causes the proteins in the mix to gelatinize. During this process, salts in the mix serve to emulsify it and thus improve the meltability of the final product. The heated product is then placed in packaging such as bags-in-boxes while still <b>hot,</b> <b>as</b> it is more easily handled in this state compared to when in a solid state. During packaging, these types of pizza cheeses are then quick-cooled to avoid browning of the product, which can occur vis-a-vis the Maillard reaction.|$|E

5|$|Theoretical models {{predict that}} {{volatile}} compounds {{such as water}} and carbon dioxide, if present, might evaporate in the scorching heat of the sunward side, migrate to the cooler night side, and condense to form ice caps. Over time, the entire atmosphere might freeze into ice caps on the night side of the planet. However, it remains unknown if water and/or carbon dioxide are even present {{on the surface of}} Gliese 581c. Alternatively, an atmosphere large enough to be stable would circulate the heat more evenly, allowing for a wider habitable area on the surface. For example, although Venus has a small axial inclination, very little sunlight reaches the surface at the poles. A slow rotation rate approximately 117 times slower than Earth's produces prolonged days and nights. Despite the uneven distribution of sunlight cast on Venus at any given time, polar areas and the night side of Venus are kept almost as <b>hot</b> <b>as</b> on the day side by globally circulating winds.|$|E
5|$|The strong {{rotating}} {{winds of}} a tropical cyclone {{are a result}} of the conservation of angular momentum imparted by the Earth's rotation as air flows inwards toward the axis of rotation. As a result, they rarely form within 5° of the equator. Tropical cyclones are also almost completely absent from Earth’s southwestern quartersphere, mainly because the shapes of the African and South American continents permit the Benguela and Humboldt Currents to cover ocean basins as far north as 5˚N with excessively cool water. These powerful cold currents also produce much stronger vertical wind shear in the South Atlantic and Southeast Pacific, which typically prevent tropical depressions and minor storms there from developing into cyclones and prevent even the waters of the Brazil Current from being so <b>hot</b> <b>as</b> analogous western boundary currents or ocean gyres. Also, the African easterly jet and areas of atmospheric instability which gives rise to cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, along with the Asian monsoon and Western Pacific Warm Pool, are feature of the Northern Hemisphere and Australia.|$|E

Heads of corn are cut up and boiled into a mash, which is then fermented and distilled using improvised stills made from cut oil drums.

To compete with Moore, Irving built a new sternwheeler in 1881, the $80,000 Elizabeth J Irving, which on its second trip to Yale, raced Moore's Western Slope and, midway through the race, caught on fire and was soon reduced to a charred wreck, resulting in the deaths of four First Nations crewmen, two horses and two cows. The loss was a tremendous blow to John Irving, who had just allowed the vessel's insurance to expire a week earlier.|$|E
25|$|The {{variable}} {{temperature of}} the first surge was due to interaction with the buildings. Any population remaining in structural refuges could not have escaped, as the city was surrounded by gases of incinerating temperatures. The lowest temperatures were in rooms under collapsed roofs. These were as low as , the boiling point of water. The authors suggest that elements of {{the bottom of the}} flow were decoupled from the main flow by topographic irregularities and were made cooler by the introduction of ambient turbulent air. In the second surge the irregularities were gone and the city was as <b>hot</b> <b>as</b> the surrounding environment.|$|E

When the temperature becomes <b>hot,</b> <b>as</b> it often does in Japan {{during the summer}} months when the P. snelleni nests are in existence, the paper wasps need to take measures to cool down the nest. Water transport to the nest occurs after the appearance of larvae, and once it starts, it occurs about 10-15 times in succession. Water drops are carried by the wasps and put on the concave nest roof. This aids in cooling the nest. When there is shade over the nest, the wasps move the water and throw it away.|$|E

25|$|The five active {{chimneys}} of Loki's Castle are venting {{water as}} <b>hot</b> <b>as</b> 300 °C (570 °F) {{and sit on}} a vast mound of sulfide minerals which is about 825ft (250 m) in diameter at its base, and some 300 feet (90 m) across its top. A member of the 2008 expedition, oceanographer Marvin Lilley has speculated {{that this may be}} the largest such deposit ever seen on the sea floor. The active chimneys are mostly black in colour, but are covered with mats of white bacteria which are living on minerals and materials emitted by the vents. The older chimneys are a mottled red colour, due to the presence of deposits of oxidised iron.|$|E
25|$|An {{atmosphere}} that is dense will circulate heat, potentially allowing a wide {{area on the}} surface to be habitable. For example, Venus has a solar rotation rate approximately 117 times slower than Earth's, producing prolonged days and nights. Despite the uneven distribution of sunlight over time intervals shorter than several months, unilluminated areas of Venus are kept almost as <b>hot</b> <b>as</b> the day side by globally circulating winds. Simulations have shown that an atmosphere containing appropriate levels of CO2 and H2O need only be a tenth the pressure of Earth's atmosphere (100 mbar) to effectively distribute heat to the night side. Current technology cannot determine the atmospheric or surface composition of the planet due to the overpowering light of its parent star.|$|E
25|$|Summer sees {{heat and}} {{humidity}} predominate in the east, while hotter and less humid conditions are generally present in the west.
