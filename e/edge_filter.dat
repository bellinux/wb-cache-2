5000|$|In {{analogue}} TV broadcasting {{the visual}} radio frequency (RF) signal {{is produced by}} amplitude modulation (AM) i.e., the video signal (VF) modulates the carrier. In AM two symmetric sidebands appear, containing identical information. So the RF bandwidth is two times the VF bandwidth. For example, the RF bandwidth of a VF signal with a bandwidth of 4.2 MHz, is 8.4 MHz. (System M) In order to use the broadcast band more efficiently, one sideband can be suppressed. However, {{it is impossible to}} suppress one sideband completely without affecting the other. Furthermore, a very sharp <b>edge</b> <b>filter</b> characteristic causes intolerable delay problems. So as a compromise, a standard filter is used which reduces a considerable portion of one side band (lower side band in RF) without causing extensive delay problems. Such a filter is known as vestigial side band filter (VSB).|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{separation}} between s- and p-polarization components invariably affects thin film <b>edge</b> <b>filters</b> used for tilted incidence {{and is a}} difficult problem for many applications, especially for optical communication. This paper presents a novel design method to obtain <b>edge</b> <b>filters</b> with non-polarization at incidence angle of 45 °. The polarization separation at 50 % trans-mittance for a long-wave-pass filter and a short-wave-pass filter is 0. 3 nm and 0. 1 nm respectively. The design method {{is based on a}} broadband Fabry-Perot thin-film interference filter in which the higher or lower interference band at both sides of the main transmittance peak can be used for initial design of long-wave-pass filter or short-wave-pass filter and then can be refined to reduce the transmittance ripples. The spacer 2 H 2 L 2 H or 2 L 2 H 2 L of the filter is usually taken. Moreover, the method for expanding the bandwidth of rejection and transmission is explained. The bandwidth of 200 nm for both rejection region and transmission band is obtained at wavelength 1550 nm. In this way, the long-wave-pass and short-wave-pass <b>edge</b> <b>filters</b> with zero {{separation between}} two polarization components can easily be fabricated...|$|R
