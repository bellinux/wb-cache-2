5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Habsburgs had been {{involved}} in a major power struggle with the French kings of the House of Valois over the control of the remains of the realm of Charles the Bold, whose daughter and heiress Mary Maximilian had married. Maximilian's second marriage in 1493 with Bianca Maria Sforza from Milan then got the Habsburgs <b>directly</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the Italian Wars, clashing again with the French kings over the control of the Duchy of Milan.|$|E

5|$|The {{molecules}} {{bound and}} acted upon by enzymes are called substrates. Although enzymes can consist {{of hundreds of}} amino acids, it is usually {{only a small fraction}} of the residues that come in contact with the substrate, and an even smaller fraction—three to four residues on average—that are <b>directly</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> catalysis. The region of the enzyme that binds the substrate and contains the catalytic residues is known as the active site.|$|E
5|$|Although Poore's Brickworks {{was well}} established, Jones {{believed}} there was potential profit in the Duke of Buckingham's capitalising on his access to a railway line by becoming <b>directly</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> brickmaking. Trials with Brill clay in 1883 proved positive, and in April 1885 Jones sought estimates for machinery and labour necessary to produce 10million bricks a year. It was decided that 5million bricks per year was a realistic figure, with bricks to be manufactured in kilns between Brill and Wood Siding stations and shipped down the Tramway to the national network. Progress was slow and obstructed by the local authority.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{had given}} {{sanctuary}} to Tostig Godwinson when the Northumbrians drove him out, Malcolm was not <b>directly</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the ill-fated invasion of England by Harald Hardraade and Tostig in 1066, which ended in defeat and death {{at the battle of}} Stamford Bridge. In 1068, he granted asylum to a group of English exiles fleeing from William of Normandy, among them Agatha, widow of Edward the Confessor's nephew Edward the Exile, and her children: Edgar Ætheling and his sisters Margaret and Cristina. They were accompanied by Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria. The exiles were disappointed, however, if they had expected immediate assistance from the Scots.|$|E
5|$|Another {{conflict}} {{that is part}} of the party's background was the Algerian War (many frontistes, including Le Pen, were <b>directly</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the war), and the right-wing dismay over the decision by French President Charles de Gaulle to abandon his promise of holding on to French Algeria. In the 1965 presidential election, Le Pen unsuccessfully attempted to consolidate the right-wing vote around the right-wing presidential candidate Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the French far-right consisted mainly of small extreme movements such as Occident, Groupe Union Défense (GUD), and the Ordre Nouveau (ON).|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{bombardment}} of Kagoshima, the Satsuma domain had become {{closer to the}} British and was pursuing the modernization of its army and navy with their support. The Scottish dealer Thomas Blake Glover sold quantities of warships and guns to the southern domains. American and British military experts, usually former officers, may have been <b>directly</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> this military effort. The British ambassador Harry Smith Parkes supported the anti-Shogunate forces in a drive to establish a legitimate, unified Imperial rule in Japan, and to counter French influence with the Shogunate. During that period, southern Japanese leaders such as Saigō Takamori of Satsuma, or Itō Hirobumi and Inoue Kaoru of Chōshū cultivated personal connections with British diplomats, notably Ernest Mason Satow.|$|E
50|$|The American Red Cross {{was criticized}} in the media, by New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, and by some in Congress for {{designating}} funds for 9/11 related activities {{that did not}} <b>directly</b> <b>involve</b> victims. <b>In</b> fact, general funding was a long-standing Red Cross policy. The Red Cross was forced to change its policy.|$|R

5|$|Enzymes {{are usually}} {{much larger than}} their substrates. Sizes range from just 62 amino acid {{residues}}, for the monomer of 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase, to over 2,500 residues in the animal fatty acid synthase. Only {{a small portion of}} their structure (around 2–4 amino acids) is <b>directly</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> catalysis: the catalytic site. This catalytic site is located next to one or more binding sites where residues orient the substrates. The catalytic site and binding site together comprise the enzyme's active site. The remaining majority of the enzyme structure serves to maintain the precise orientation and dynamics of the active site.|$|E
5|$|Fincher {{realized}} that {{his job was to}} dispel the mythic stature the case had taken on over the years by clearly defining what was fact and what was fiction. He told Vanderbilt that he wanted the screenplay re-written but with additional research done from the original police reports. Fincher found {{that there was a lot}} of speculation and hearsay and wanted to interview people <b>directly</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the case in person to see if he believed what they were telling him. Fincher did this because he felt a burden of responsibility in making a film that convicted someone posthumously.|$|E
5|$|George {{was born}} July 19, 1893 in Somerville, Massachusetts, to Horace and Susan E. George.

George joined the United States Army and on May 21, 1917, received his commission as second lieutenant in the Cavalry as a reserve officer. A month later, he went on active duty with the Cavalry at Fort Myer, Virginia, and married Anna Virginia Helms on August 10. In October George resigned his reserve commission to become a flying cadet with the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps.|$|E

5|$|He {{was more}} <b>directly</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> the {{activities}} of the commissioned raiders, ships of the Confederate States Navy that were sent out to destroy rather than capture enemy commerce. He first proposed their use as early as April 18, 1861. The first raider, , avoided the Union blockade at New Orleans on June 30, 1861. From then until after the war was over, the small group of raiders plundered Union shipping, inflicting damage on the American Merchant Marine that persists to the present day. They failed of their primary purpose, however, because Welles maintained the Union blockade, and international trade continued as before, carried in ships flying foreign flags.|$|E
5|$|In September 1979, Khalqist President Nur Muhammad Taraki {{was assassinated}} in a coup within the PDPA orchestrated by fellow Khalq member Hafizullah Amin, who assumed the presidency. Distrusted by the Soviets, Amin was assassinated by Soviet special forces in December 1979. A Soviet-organized government, led by Parcham's Babrak Karmal but {{inclusive}} of both factions, filled the vacuum. Soviet troops were deployed to stabilize Afghanistan under Karmal in more substantial numbers, although the Soviet government {{did not expect to}} do most of the fighting in Afghanistan. As a result, however, the Soviets were now <b>directly</b> <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> what had been a domestic war in Afghanistan.|$|E

About 50 North Koreans infiltrated before dawn to A Battery's position and assaulted it. North Koreans employing submachine guns overran two artillery-machine-gun perimeter positions, penetrating to the artillery pieces at 03:00. There, Captain Andrew C. Anderson {{and his men}} fought hand-to-hand combat with the North Koreans. Some of the guns fell temporarily into North Korean hands but the artillerymen repulsed the attack, aided by the concentrations of fire from C Battery, 90th Field Artillery Battalion nearby, which cut off the North Koreans from reinforcements. In defending its guns in this night battle, A Battery lost seven men killed and 12 wounded.|$|E
