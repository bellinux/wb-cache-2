5|$|Pro-slavery advocates {{claimed that}} enslaved Africans were lesser <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>who</b> benefited from their bondage. Wilberforce, the Clapham Sect {{and others were}} anxious to {{demonstrate}} that Africans, and particularly freed slaves, had human and economic abilities beyond the slave trade, {{and that they were}} capable of sustaining a well-ordered society, trade and cultivation. Inspired in part by the utopian vision of Granville Sharp, they became involved in the establishment in 1792 of a free colony in Sierra Leone with black settlers from the United Kingdom, Nova Scotia and Jamaica, as well as native Africans and some whites. They formed the Sierra Leone Company, with Wilberforce subscribing liberally to the project in money and time. The dream was of an ideal society in which races would mix on equal terms; the reality was fraught with tension, crop failures, disease, death, war and defections to the slave trade. Initially a commercial venture, the British government assumed responsibility for the colony in 1808. The colony, although troubled at times, was to become a symbol of anti-slavery in which residents, communities and African tribal chiefs, worked together to prevent enslavement at the source, supported by a British naval blockade to stem the region's slave trade.|$|E

Texts such as Heimskringla, composed in the 13th century by Snorri and Gesta Danorum, composed in Latin by Saxo Grammaticus in Denmark in the 12th century, are the results of heavy amounts of euhemerization.|$|E

25|$|In the 2005 novel Dead Lines by Greg Bear, a {{new type}} of analog cell phone called Trans with global reach, {{requiring}} no network of relay towers, is promoted by the book's protagonist, Peter Russell. The technology utilized by Trans uses the nearly unlimited quantum bandwidth by which subatomic particles communicate with each other, and when users of Trans begin to see ghosts, Peter gradually discovers that Trans has tapped into a channel where human memories are stored and survive the death of the body. Unfortunately, Trans has made a noise and awakened nameless things much older than <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> <b>who</b> feed on souls and memories.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{tenet of}} Reform {{theology}} {{is a belief}} in a continuous, or progressive, revelation, occurring continuously and {{not limited to the}} theophany at Sinai, the defining event in traditional interpretation. According to this view, all holy scripture of Judaism, including the Pentateuch, were authored by <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>who,</b> though under divine inspiration, inserted their understanding and reflected the spirit of their consecutive ages. All the People Israel are a further link in the chain of revelation, capable of reaching new insights: religion can be renewed without necessarily being dependent on past conventions. The chief promulgator of this concept was Abraham Geiger, generally considered founder of the movement. After critical research led him to regard scripture as a human creation, bearing the marks of historical circumstances, he abandoned the belief in the unbroken perpetuity of tradition derived from Sinai and gradually replaced it with the idea of progressive revelation.|$|E
25|$|Madilog {{introduced}} {{a way of}} thinking of evidence and fact in a way that fit into Indonesian demographics and culture, in line with Indonesian thinking on fundamentals. Evidence is fact and fact is founded on scientific evidence. There are two main ways of thinking in Western philosophy. The first is idea (mind), unity of thinking, and sense. The second is matter as tangible reality, objective in nature as existence. Those two concepts were combined in the same way of thinking for <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> <b>who</b> are the subject living things. In Madilog, the main field is evidence. Although evidence can't be described rationally, scientifically—as to what, why, and how—evidence should be considered as a true way of thinking, the consequence of not thinking evidentially being logical fallacies and myth-making. This is the focus of the epistemology of Madilog, concerning truth, the validity of science, and the correlation of human knowledge to life. The epistemology is divided into three parts: definition, testing, and mathematical thinking.|$|E

Vanyel {{does not want to be}} a Herald or a Mage, and suspects the people around him value his powers, not himself. He runs away, but as he thinks things over he realizes that Savil and the others have shown that they care about him. Just when he realizes that and moves to return he discovers a village being terrorized by a colddrake, a type of dragon. Before he can even think to do anything, he witnesses the dragon killing an elderly man. He pulls himself together and kills the dragon, but the unfortunate timing gives Vanyel the impression that he is a coward. The Tayledras later explain that he is not at all cowardly and that his reactions were normal.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{with the}} Religions Law of May 1938, a cult of Emperor-worship closely {{modeled after the}} Imperial cult in Japan where the Showa Emperor was worshiped as a living god, began in Manchukuo. Just as in Japan, {{schoolchildren}} began their classes by praying to {{a portrait of the}} emperor while imperial rescripts and the imperial regalia become sacred relics imbued with magical powers by being associated with the god-emperor. As the Emperor Puyi was considered to be a living god, his will could not be limited by any law, and the purpose of the law was starkly reduced down to serving the will of the emperor rather than upholding values and rules. As in Japan, the idea governing the legal philosophy in Manchukuo was the Emperor was a living god who was responsible to no-one and who delegated some of his powers down to mere <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>who</b> had the duty of obeying the will of the god-emperors. In Japan and Manchukuo, the actions of the god-emperors were always just and moral because gods could never do wrong, rather than because the god-emperors were acting to uphold moral values that existed a prior.|$|E

Lead writer Jesse Stern noted that despite the grim subject matter, people instinctively {{want to know what}} it is like to experience these attacks, and cited documentaries about the 2008 Mumbai attacks and the Columbine High School massacre as evidence. According to Stern: [...] "These are <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>who</b> perpetrate these acts, so you don't really want to turn a blind eye to it. You want to take it apart and figure out how that happened and what, if anything, can be done to prevent it. Ultimately, our intention was to put you as close as possible to atrocity." ...|$|E
500|$|Literature scholar Tonia Payne {{has written}} that [...] "Paradises Lost" [...] {{is an example of}} ecocriticism, wherein Le Guin critiques the idea that human beings are {{separate}} from their natural environment. The premise of the novella involves <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>who</b> live their entire lives on a ship in interstellar space, and who therefore have to create a new reality for themselves, a notion also explored in Le Guin's short story [...] "Newton's Sleep". The inhabitants of Discovery become unable to relate to representations of Earth. Some, like Hsing and Luis, still try to understand Ti Chiu, keeping in mind their position {{as a part of a}} continuum of people supposed to colonize a new planet. For others, this new reality takes the form of the religious beliefs of the cult of Bliss. These beliefs are portrayed as an understandable attempt to adjust to the reality of spaceflight. A review by Publishers Weekly identified a similar theme, common to the other stories in the [...] "Birthday of the World" [...] collection, of characters coming to terms with the world they live in.|$|E

On 21 December 1874 he was promoted to Staff-Surgeon Second Class. In May 1875 he was appointed to HMS Discovery, one of two ships—the other HMS Alert—which comprised the British Arctic Expedition, led by Captain Sir George Nares. The expedition aimed {{to be the first to}} reach the North Pole, pushing north through Smith Sound, between Ellesmere Island and Greenland. The two ships made slow progress up the sound, repeatedly halted by dense pack ice. During August of the first year, the expedition's Greenland Dogs began to show signs of disease; the dogs experienced fits and [...] "madness", owing, it was assumed, [...] "to close confinement, wet decks, and want of natural exercise." [...] Ninnis and Fleet-Surgeon Thomas Colon of the Alert were charged with investigating the disease. Ninnis' report to Nares noted the disease's similarity to rabies, [...] "but there is no instance recorded in Greenland of <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> <b>who</b> have been bitten having suffered from hydrophobia , and the recovery of the animals in some instances is entirely opposed to the recorded experience of true rabies." ...|$|E
