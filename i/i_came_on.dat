It was later {{revealed}} with the film's release that he is Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Waltz got interested in the film for dealing with technology-assisted mass surveillance, [...] "speaking about relevant social issues in a way that few Bonds have done before”, and denied rumours that the role was written specially for him, but added that [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> board, the role grew, evolved, and mutated." ...|$|E
500|$|With Singer busy {{preparing}} X2, Confessions was rejuvenated with Clooney {{taking over}} as director. Miramax Films agreed to cover distribution duties and co-finance the film. In the end, funding for Confessions came from Miramax, Clooney's own Section Eight Productions, Village Roadshow Pictures, producer Andrew Lazar's Mad Chance, Allied Filmmakers, and The Kushner-Locke Company. Clooney explained, [...] "I thought if <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> board as a director, for scale, {{and was able}} to bring everybody else on inexpensively, if I could get the film back down to $30 million, then I {{was going to be able}} to get the film made. That was a big part of my pitch to Harvey Weinstein at Miramax." ...|$|E

He came on {{as a substitute for}} Maik Taylor on 76 minutes, conceding one goal scored by Lukas Podolski. On reflection of this match, Ingham said [...] "The reaction of the crowd when <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> was amazing. To be honest I was holding back the tears as I never thought I would get such a reception. I was the proudest man in the ground." [...] For this match, he was offered insurance by the IFA, due to him not yet being under contract at Wrexham. This appearance would result in a £30,000 payment for former club Cliftonville, which came {{as a part of the}} deal for Sunderland to sign him, but by August 2005 this had still to be received by the club. The Premier League was called into the situation by Cliftonville, as they had only received the first part of the payment after he made his first-team debut for Sunderland. Ingham himself was also due a £20,000 bonus for this appearance.|$|E

500|$|Travolta and his manager, Jonathan Krane, {{took the}} lead in hiring the on-set personnel. They {{initially}} approached Quentin Tarantino to direct the film. When Tarantino declined, Roger Christian, a protégé of George Lucas, was recruited as the director on the advice of Lucas. Christian had most recently been the second unit director on Lucas' [...] Patrick Tatopoulos was signed to develop the production design and costumes, including the design of the alien Psychlos, and Czech-American composer Elia Cmiral was signed to provide the film's score. Travolta and Krane also signed the cinematographer and most of the principal actors. Corey Mandell, a screenwriter who had previously worked with Ridley Scott on Blade Runner, signed on to write the script for the film, which had previously gone through 10 revisions. Mandell stated in an interview, [...] "I am not a Scientologist… <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> board because John asked me to read the book and said, 'It's not a religious book. It's a science-fiction story. There's nothing sacred about the story, nothing of the religious philosophy.

Tormé stepped down from his role as co-executive story editor, taking credit instead as a creative consultant. Following Hurley's modifications to Tormé's scripts for [...] "The Royale" [...] and [...] "", Tormé elected to be credited under a pseudonym only. At one point, Roddenberry had thought that Tormé would become eventual showrunner, but the writer left due to the re-writes required under Hurley's tenure. Hannah Louise Shearer also left the team between seasons, due to differences with Hurley, but contributed stories in later seasons. Other writers joined the team during the second season, including The Tears of the Singers author Melinda M. Snodgrass, who sold the script for [...] "". Hans Beimler and Richard Manning were hired in the newly created positions of executive script consultants. They had both been story editors for the final eight episodes of the first season. Snodgrass later explained that, [...] "Once <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> board there suddenly seemed to be this climate of discussion among the writers about {{what we wanted to}} do with the show. My impression was that this was a new phenomenon. We were a little bit more on the same wavelength." [...] She was hired as a story editor following the submission of her first episode, alongside Leonard Mlodinow and Scott Rubenstein. The other two editors left after four more episodes, with Snodgrass remaining as the sole story editor for the rest of the season.|$|E

The audience had been giggling at the absurd plot even before this simian had at me. Now it became hysterical. What did Tallulah do in this crisis? I turned a cartwheel! The audience roared...

2500|$|Spielberg {{suggested}} that Boam write the next draft, and Lucas agreed to it. Boam felt some nervousness {{going into the}} process. He joked that [...] "the battlefield was littered with writers before <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> to the scene. There were four or five before me. Each writer had their script next to them covered with blood." [...] Boam said that when Spielberg called to offer him the job, Spielberg said [...] "something like, 'You wanna get real rich?' and I said, 'Yeah, why?' and he said, 'I think you should do the next Indiana Jones movie.'" [...] Boam {{is reported to have}} replied to Spielberg's offer by saying, [...] "I just don't know why you didn't come to me before." [...] Boam spent two weeks filled with eight-hour days working with Lucas to develop the story. The two blocked out all other commitments to create the story, building it [...] "beat by beat". Lucas already knew many of the set pieces that were to be in the movie. During the two-week story conference, Boam worked to incorporate it all into the new narrative.
