40|$|Chemical {{strengthening}} of aluminosilicate glasses through K+-Na+ ion exchange has attracted tremendous attentions {{because of the}} accelerating demand for high strength and damage resistance glasses. However, a paramount challenge still exists to fabricate glasses with a higher strength and greater depth of <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>layer.</b> Herein, aluminosilicate glasses with different contents of P 2 O 5 were prepared {{and the influence of}} P 2 O 5 on the increased compressive stress and depth of <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>layer</b> was investigated by micro-Raman technique. It was noticed that the hardness, compressive stress, as well as the depth of <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>layer</b> substantially increased with an increasing concentration of P 2 O 5 varied from 1 to 7 mol%. The obtained micro-Raman spectra confirmed the formation of relatively depolymerized silicate anions that accelerated the ion exchange. Phosphorus containing aluminosilicate glasses with a lower polymerization degree exhibited a higher strength and deeper depth of <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>layer,</b> which suggests that the phosphorus containing aluminosilicate glasses have promising applications in flat panel displays, windshields, and wafer sealing substrates...|$|E
40|$|A {{large number}} of {{neutralization}} reactions take place in industrial chemistry, such as acids which react with bases to form salts and water. However, most of these salts have no commercial value and are discharged into the environment which will result in environment pollution. In light of this pollution, the ideal solution is to convert the salt and water back into acid and base by using a bipolar membrane treatment. A bipolar membrane is a polymeric layered structure composed of a cation <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>layer</b> joined in series to an anion <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>layer.</b> However, the preparation of bipolar membranes makes practically using these applications a crucial problem. the casting method has encountered a key problem which is a selection of anion exchange layer because of comparison with a cation exchange layer. Preparation of anion exchange layer is also conducted by chloromethylation and quaternary amination steps at last. In chloromethylation, chloromethyl methyl ether used for producing an anion exchange layer is very harmful to human health and a carcinogen. Moreover, Polysulfone used as the started materials needed to be modified by sulfonation, chloromethlylation and quaternary amination. The properties of the bipolar membranes are limited by the sulfonation degree and quaternary amination degree of the single layer.

40|$|This {{article is}} an updated {{review of the}} {{published}} literature on glass-ionomer cements and covers their structure, properties and clinical uses within dentistry, {{with an emphasis on}} findings from the last five years or so. Glass-ionomers are shown to set by an acid-base reaction within 2 – 3 min and to form hard, reasonably strong materials with acceptable appearance. They release fluoride and are bioactive, so that they gradually develop a strong, durable interfacial <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>layer</b> at the interface with the tooth, which is responsible for their adhesion. Modified forms of glass-ionomers, namely resin-modified glass-ionomers and glass carbomer, are also described and their properties and applications covered. Physical properties of the resin-modified glass-ionomers are shown to be good, and comparable with those of conventional glass-ionomers, but biocompatibility is somewhat compromised by the presence of the resin component, 2 hydroxyethyl methacrylate. Properties of glass carbomer appear to be slightly inferior to those of the best modern conventional glass-ionomers, and there is not yet sufficient information to determine how their bioactivity compares, although they have been formulated to enhance this particular feature...|$|E

This technique allowed introducing Ag+ ions {{only on the}} surface of the base glass while maintaining its bioactivity. The ion-exchanged glasses were characterized by means of X-Ray diffraction, SEMobservations and compositional analysis (EDS). The control of the Ag+ content on the surface, as well as its diffusion profile throughout the <b>ion-exchanged</b> <b>layer,</b> was obtained by a careful choice of the ion-exchange parameters (temperature, time and silver concentration in the molten bath). A very good repeatability in the diffusion profile and in the silver concentration throughout the <b>ion-exchanged</b> <b>layer</b> was achieved. In vitro tests were performed on the ion-exchanged samples in order to verify their bioactive behavior (soaking in a simulated body fluid).

In order to obtain the AC electrical impedance of a BM, a small sinusoidal current perturbation was superimposed to the DC current, and the resulting frequency-dependent impedance spectra were recorded under different conditions of electrical polarisation and temperature for five BMs. The experimental spectra were measured in three current ranges: below the limiting current region, {{at the onset of}} the overlimiting region and in the electric field enhanced water dissociation region. This allows for a better understanding of the contributions of the salt and water ions to the measured impedance spectra. Measurements of the impedance of the forward biased membrane were also carried out. Although the experimental impedance spectra appear to be in qualitative agreement with previous theoretical models incorporating the effect of the electric field enhanced water dissociation, a quantitative analysis of the results is not still possible due to the high number of parameters involved. # 199...|$|R

40|$|Separation of {{the amino}} acids in urine {{by use of}} thin-layer {{chromatography}} (TLC) has hitherto required that the specimen be first desalted and then chromatographed in two dimensions {{with at least two}} pairs of developing solvent systems. We wished to simplify both steps. The customary method of desalting on a column is replaced by desalting on a plate that supports a strongly acid cation-exchanger and a cellulose layer. This method, originally developed for one-dimensional TLC, is used here for two-dimensional TLC. Urine is applied to the <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>layer</b> and strong acids and neutral substances are removed with water. The amino acids are then chromatographed into the cellulose layer, and are separated there two dimensionally with a newly devised pair of developing solutions. This pair of solvents separates nearly all of the amino acids in urine. Additional Keyphrases novel developing system desalting on the TLC plate screeninq technique for inherited amino acid anomalies SEPARATION OF THE urinary amino acids is nec-essary for the recognition of certain anomalies of amino acid metabolism.

X-ray absorption spectroscopy is a particularly important technique used to investigate {{the site of the}} metal ions introduced into the matrix, in specific cases also singling out the dopant oxidation state. Two case studies are reported in this paper, namely Cu-for-Na and Ag-for-Na <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>layers</b> of silicate glasses. The experimental results show that the site of the dopant ion is different from the one that replaced alkali ion: while in the first case the Cu site (i. e. the first oxygen shell around the metal species) is a linear combination of the sites of the crystalline oxides (CuO or Cu 2 O), with linear combination coefficients that depend on the average oxidation state, in the case of Ag, the Ag-O distance is much longer than in the Ag 2 O.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of bipolar membranes in NaCl and Na 2 SO 4 solutions is discussed. The membranes {{are characterized}} {{in terms of}} their limiting current densities. Below the limiting current density the electric current is carried by salt ions migrating from the transition region between the anion and the cation exchange layer of the bipolar membrane. In steady state these ions are replaced by salt ions transported from the bulk solutions into the transition region by diffusion and migration {{due to the fact that}} the <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>layers</b> are not strictly permselective. When the limiting current density is exceeded, the salt transport from the transition region can no longer be compensated by the transport into the region and a drastic increase in the membrane resistance and enhanced water dissociation is observed. This water dissociation is described as being a combination of the second Wien effect and the protonation and deprotonation of functional groups in the membrane. The limiting current density is calculated from a mass balance that includes all components involved in the transport. The parameters used in the mathematical treatment are the diffusion coefficients of salt ions and water, the ion mobilities in the membrane, the fixed charge densitiy of the membrane, the pKb values of the functional groups and the solution bulk concentrations...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a new type of composite membrane consisting of a microfiltration support membrane, an immobilised liquid membrane phase and a hydrophilic, charged polymer layer and its function as a supported liquid membrane (SLM) for copper selective transport are described. The <b>ion-exchange</b> <b>layers</b> function as stabilisation layers to improve the membrane lifetime and consist of sulphonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK). This polymer shows a high permeability for copper ions due to the presence of fixed negative charges and to its swelling capacity in an aqueous phase. A method was developed to prepare composite membranes composed of the support membranes Celgard with one stabilisation layer on either the feed or strip side of the membrane or on both sides. Good adhesion of homogeneous, negatively charged, hydrophilic SPEEK layers to the hydrophobic macroporous support membranes could only be established when the support membranes were first hydrophilised with a concentrated sulphuric acid solution containing 5 wt% free SO 3. The lifetime of the SLMs is significantly improved when one stabilisation layer is applied at the strip side or two layers at both sides of the SLM. A second advantage of this composite SLM is the increase in copper flux caused by a decrease in thickness of liquid membrane phase. However, when SPEEK penetrates entirely through some pores of the support membrane, ions diffuse non-specifically through the SPEEK matrix resulting in an undesired selectivity loss. This phenomenon occurs only when thin Celgard membranes are used as support membranes...|$|R
40|$|Flexible {{electronics}} and displays rely on strong thin borosilicate glasses. Furthermore, borosilicate glass {{play a vital}} role in pharmaceutical packaging, particularly for the container of liquid medicine in the auto-injectors. Because of the risk of failure due to the fracture of the glass ampule the costumers need to purchase several units of auto-injector; also, the injector price increases dramatically. This renewed the interest in the strengthening of soda-borosilicate glass. Moreover, the applications of strong thin borosilicate glasses in flexible electronics attracted attention. Chemical strengthening is a practical means of improving the mechanical performance of soda borosilicate glasses. The chemical strengthening process involves the immersion of an alkali-silicate glass in a molten nitrate salt containing potassium ions at temperatures below the glass-transition temperature where the replacement of small alkali ions in the glass with larger potassium ions from the molten salt occurs. The glass composition, salts impurities, temperature and time, are crucial factors of the treatment. Furthermore, applying an electric field can speed up the process and improves the efficiency. This study investigates the impact of potassium for sodium ion exchange and its parameters on the final strength of alkali borosilicate glasses. Alkali borosilicate tubes, used in pharmaceutical packaging, were subjected to ion exchange in potassium nitrate salts containing different impurities. The initial surface flaws have a significant impact on the final strength due to the limited case depth of surface compression in alklai borosilicate glass subjected to ion exchange. Nonetheless, the results revealed that the sodium poisoning of salt has a limited influence on strengthening; conversely, even a small amount of calcium spoils the strengthening. The replacement of sodium ions with calcium is thermodynamically favoured with respect to Na/K ion-exchange. Calcium can penetrate into the glass surface and prevent the replacement of sodium with potassium and, consequently, the generation of compressive stress. Interestingly, performing electric field assisted ion exchange, EF-IE, for 10 min produces an <b>ion-exchanged</b> <b>layer</b> as deep as conventional strengthening for 4 hours in soda borosilicate glass. Electric field assisted ion exchange also augments the glass strength and makes the glass more damage resistant; however, the initial defects on the glass surface have an adverse influence on the efficiency, as expected. Applying an electric field changes the governing mechanism of ion exchange and accelerates the penetration of potassium ions into the glass; furthermore, the glass structure of the layer undergone electric field assisted ion exchange is modified during the process. Although EF-IE generates a strong surface compression in glass, the inhomogeneous distribution of residual stress is a drawback. Performing EF-IE using AC E-fields produces homogenous <b>ion-exchanged</b> <b>layers</b> in glass and is, probably, a practical approach to balancing the residual stress in glass. Chemical strengthening of a thin alkali-borosilicate glass,D 263 Teco®, is also investigated in the present work. Na/K ion exchange improves the glass strength three times. Although the surface compression generated by ion-exchange in alkali borosilicate glasses is not as strong as typically used glasses for chemical strengthening (alklai aluminosilicate), it can be used to improve the mechanical properties of borosilicate glass. Annealing prior to the ion exchange increases the compressive stress generated on the surface; however, its effect on strengthening is trivial. The compressive stress produced by Na/K ion exchange in thin alkali borosilicate glass improves the damage resistance and the bending strength of glass. Due to the limited thickness of samples, heat treatments with high heating and cooling rates can be conducted. Such heat treatments can be used to carry out surface relaxation and improve the strength of samples by “surface relaxation”. A fast heat treatment after ion exchange improves the finals strength samples about 40...|$|R

Linear response time to ClO 4 - at 100 μg/L was approximately 111 ± 28 seconds. Kinetic evaluation of the sensor response to ClO 4 - revealed linear increases (r 2 > 99 %) in 10 min with k values of 10. 3, 24. 2, 33. 9 and 48. 2 at 25, 50, 75 and 100 μg/L, respectively.

This interest has been renewed due to potential applications in the remediation of nuclear waste. They are believed to be preferred to the conventional ion-exchange materials due to their increased stability under acid conditions. The ability of the material to withstand low pH is crucial as the legacy waste pools have very low pH. It has been well documented that substituting metals with different radii into material’s framework can alter the ion-exchange properties of the material due to differences in the crystal structure and the interactions between the framework and the non-framework ions.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of two structural analogues of the naturally occurring compound phosphocitrate (PC) was investigated, {{with a view}} to producing compounds more enzymatically stable than PC, yet with similar anti-calcifying properties. It was envisaged that such compounds might prove to be suitable agents for preventing the deposition of insoluble calcium salts associated with pathological calcification, especially kidney stones. The analogues sought were the sulphamate and phosphoramidate derivatives of PC; namely N-phospho- 2 -amino tricarballylate (PAT) and N-sulpho- 2 -amino tricarballylate (SAT). The preparation of PAT, which was ultimately achieved after investigating a number of unsuccessful synthetic routes, involved two distinct stages: a) {{synthesis of}} a new precursor in trimethyl 2 -amino tricarballylate, and b) coupling of the latter compound with 2 -cyanoethyl phosphate, followed by alkaline hydrolysis. The preparation of SAT was effected by the coupling of 2 -amino tricarballylate with pyridine-sulphur trioxide. The same synthetic route was also utilized to yield [35 Si-labelled SAT. Systems which were developed to aid in the ultimate purification and characterization of synthetic products included <b>ion-exchange</b> and thin <b>layer</b> chromatography, electrophoresis, isotachophoresis and chemical assays. Additional structural proof of the new compounds was obtained through [1 H]-NMR and infra-red spectroscopy. The ability of the PC analogues to inhibit calcification in vitro was assessed. PAT was as potent as PC in preventing hydroxyapatite formation, while SAT was less potent but still a strong inhibitor. Both compounds also inhibited calcium oxalate crystallization, the order of potency being PC > SAT >> PAT. The chemical and biological stabilities of the molecules were studied. In vitro, PAT was found to be readily hydrolyzed at acid pH, unstable at neutral pH and susceptible to the action of alkaline phosphatase. SAT was shown to be completely stable at neutral and alkaline pH, relatively stable in acid and totally resistant to the actions of the hydrolytic enzymes sulphamatase and sulphatase. The stability of SAT was confirmed in vivo from metabolic studies utilizing [35 S]-SAT. When given orally, SAT was well absorbed across the gut and rapidly cleared unchanged to the urine from blood and all tissues. The effectiveness of the compounds in arresting renal calcification in vivo was also studied using well established test systems. Comparisons were made with other inhibitors including PC. SAT was proven capable of inhibiting calcium oxalate crystallization, whereas PC and PAT were ineffective. With hydroxyapatite formation, different trends were observed; PAT and SAT had no effect whereas PC produced pronounced inhibition. Rationalization of these findings have been given. Results presented suggest that, in terms of future possible therapeutic value, PAT would be unsuitable, whereas PC and SAT might prove useful under certain situations. The studies help define further the structure-activity relationships of PC and its new analogues in terms of anti-calcifying potential and stability. On this basis, avenues for future research are discussed for the development of further inhibitor molecules that might have greater activity and hence ultimately prove more useful agents for stone prevention...|$|R
40|$|Transition {{metal oxides}} are {{functional}} materials that have advanced applications in many areas, {{because of their}} diverse properties (optical, electrical, magnetic, etc.), hardness, thermal stability and chemical resistance. Novel applications of the nanostructures of these oxides are attracting significant interest as new synthesis methods are developed and new structures are reported. Hydrothermal synthesis is an effective process to prepare various delicate structures of metal oxides on the scales from a few to tens of nanometres, specifically, the highly dispersed intermediate structures which are hardly obtained through pyro-synthesis. In this thesis, a range of new metal oxide (stable and metastable titanate, niobate) nanostructures, namely nanotubes and nanofibres, were synthesised via a hydrothermal process. Further structure modifications were conducted and potential applications in catalysis, photocatalysis, adsorption and construction of ceramic membrane were studied. The morphology evolution during the hydrothermal reaction between Nb 2 O 5 particles and concentrated NaOH was monitored. The study demonstrates that by optimising the reaction parameters (temperature, amount of reactants), one can obtain a variety of nanostructured solids, from intermediate phases niobate bars and fibres to the stable phase cubes. Trititanate (Na 2 Ti 3 O 7) nanofibres and nanotubes were obtained by the hydrothermal reaction between TiO 2 powders or a titanium compound (e. g. TiOSO 4 ·xH 2 O) and concentrated NaOH solution by controlling the reaction temperature and NaOH concentration. The trititanate possesses a layered structure, and the Na ions that exist between the negative charged titanate layers are exchangeable with other metal ions or H+ ions. The ion-exchange has crucial influence on the phase transition of the exchanged products. The exchange of the sodium ions in the titanate with H+ ions yields protonated titanate (H-titanate) and subsequent phase transformation of the H-titanate enable various TiO 2 structures with retained morphology. H-titanate, either nanofibres or tubes, {{can be converted to}} pure TiO 2 (B), pure anatase, mixed TiO 2 (B) and anatase phases by controlled calcination and by a two-step process of acid-treatment and subsequent calcination. While the controlled calcination of the sodium titanate yield new titanate structures (metastable titanate with formula Na 1. 5 H 0. 5 Ti 3 O 7, with retained fibril morphology) {{that can be used for}} removal of radioactive ions and heavy metal ions from water. The structures and morphologies of the metal oxides were characterised by advanced techniques. Titania nanofibres of mixed anatase and TiO 2 (B) phases, pure anatase and pure TiO 2 (B) were obtained by calcining H-titanate nanofibres at different temperatures between 300 and 700 °C. The fibril morphology was retained after calcination, which is suitable for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. It has been found by TEM analysis that in mixed-phase structure the interfaces between anatase and TiO 2 (B) phases are not random contacts between the engaged crystals of the two phases, but form from the well matched lattice planes of the two phases. For instance, (101) planes in anatase and (101) planes of TiO 2 (B) are similar in d spaces (~ 0. 18 nm), and they join together to form a stable interface. The interfaces between the two phases act as an one-way valve that permit the transfer of photogenerated charge from anatase to TiO 2 (B). This reduces the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes in anatase, enhancing the activity for photocatalytic oxidation. Therefore, the mixed-phase nanofibres exhibited higher photocatalytic activity for degradation of sulforhodamine B (SRB) dye under ultraviolet (UV) light than the nanofibres of either pure phase alone, or the mechanical mixtures (which have no interfaces) of the two pure phase nanofibres with a similar phase composition. This verifies the theory that the difference between the conduction band edges of the two phases may result in charge transfer from one phase to the other, which results in effectively the photogenerated charge separation and thus facilitates the redox reaction involving these charges. Such an interface structure facilitates charge transfer crossing the interfaces. The knowledge acquired in this study is important not only for design of efficient TiO 2 photocatalysts but also for understanding the photocatalysis process. Moreover, the fibril titania photocatalysts are of great advantage when they are separated from a liquid for reuse by filtration, sedimentation, or centrifugation, compared to nanoparticles of the same scale. The surface structure of TiO 2 also plays a significant role in catalysis and photocatalysis. Four types of large surface area TiO 2 nanotubes with different phase compositions (labelled as NTA, NTBA, NTMA and NTM) were synthesised from calcination and acid treatment of the H-titanate nanotubes. Using the in situ FTIR emission spectrescopy (IES), desorption and re-adsorption process of surface OH-groups on oxide surface can be trailed. In this work, the surface OH-group regeneration ability of the TiO 2 nanotubes was investigated. The ability of the four samples distinctively different, having the order: NTA > NTBA > NTMA > NTM. The same order was observed for the catalytic when the samples served as photocatalysts for the decomposition of synthetic dye SRB under UV light, as the supports of gold (Au) catalysts (where gold particles were loaded by a colloid-based method) for photodecomposition of formaldehyde under visible light and for catalytic oxidation of CO at low temperatures. Therefore, the ability of TiO 2 nanotubes to generate surface OH-groups is an indicator of the catalytic activity. The reason behind the correlation is that the oxygen vacancies at bridging O 2 - sites of TiO 2 surface can generate surface OH-groups and these groups facilitate adsorption and activation of O 2 molecules, which is the key step of the oxidation reactions. The structure of the oxygen vacancies at bridging O 2 - sites is proposed. Also a new mechanism for the photocatalytic formaldehyde decomposition with the Au-TiO 2 catalysts is proposed: The visible light absorbed by the gold nanoparticles, due to surface plasmon resonance effect, induces transition of the 6 sp electrons of gold to high energy levels. These energetic electrons can migrate to the conduction band of TiO 2 and are seized by oxygen molecules. Meanwhile, the gold nanoparticles capture electrons from the formaldehyde molecules adsorbed on them because of gold’s high electronegativity. O 2 adsorbed on the TiO 2 supports surface are the major electron acceptor. The more O 2 adsorbed, the higher the oxidation activity of the photocatalyst will exhibit. The last part of this thesis demonstrates two innovative applications of the titanate nanostructures. Firstly, trititanate and metastable titanate (Na 1. 5 H 0. 5 Ti 3 O 7) nanofibres are used as intelligent absorbents for removal of radioactive cations and heavy metal ions, utilizing the properties of the ion exchange ability, deformable layered structure, and fibril morphology. Environmental contamination with radioactive ions and heavy metal ions can cause a serious threat to the health of a large part of the population. Treatment of the wastes is needed to produce a waste product suitable for long-term storage and disposal. The <b>ion-exchange</b> ability of <b>layered</b> titanate structure permitted adsorption of bivalence toxic cations (Sr 2 +, Ra 2 +, Pb 2 +) from aqueous solution. More importantly, the adsorption is irreversible, due to the deformation of the structure induced by the strong interaction between the adsorbed bivalent cations and negatively charged TiO 6 octahedra, and results in permanent entrapment of the toxic bivalent cations in the fibres so that the toxic ions can be safely deposited. Compared to conventional clay and zeolite sorbents, the fibril absorbents are of great advantage as they can be readily dispersed into and separated from a liquid. Secondly, new generation membranes were constructed by using large titanate and small ã-alumina nanofibres as intermediate and top layers, respectively, on a porous alumina substrate via a spin-coating process. Compared to conventional ceramic membranes constructed by spherical particles, the ceramic membrane constructed by the fibres permits high flux because of the large porosity of their separation layers. The voids in the separation layer determine the selectivity and flux of a separation membrane. When the sizes of the voids are similar (which means a similar selectivity of the separation layer), the flux passing through the membrane increases with the volume of the voids which are filtration passages. For the ideal and simplest texture, a mesh constructed with the nanofibres 10 nm thick and having a uniform pore size of 60 nm, the porosity is greater than 73. 5 %. In contrast, the porosity of the separation layer that possesses the same pore size but is constructed with metal oxide spherical particles, as in conventional ceramic membranes, is 36 % or less. The membrane constructed by titanate nanofibres and a layer of randomly oriented alumina nanofibres was able to filter out 96. 8 % of latex spheres of 60 nm size, while maintaining a high flux rate between 600 and 900 Lm– 2 h– 1, more than 15 times higher than the conventional membrane reported in the most recent study...|$|R
