5|$|At first, Napoleon was {{not totally}} {{confident}} of victory. In {{a letter written}} to Minister of Foreign Affairs Talleyrand, Napoleon requested Talleyrand not tell anyone about the upcoming battle {{because he did not}} want to disturb Empress Joséphine. According to Frederick C. Schneid, the French Emperor's chief worry was <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> explain to Joséphine a French defeat.|$|E
5|$|In January 2008, Speight found Collins's body in {{the bath}} of their shared London flat. He was arrested on {{suspicion}} of her murder, but not charged with any offence. An inquest later determined that Collins {{had died of a}} drug overdose and severe burns from hot water. In April that year, Speight was reported missing and was later discovered to have taken his own life by hanging himself near Paddington station. Two suicide notes were discovered, describing <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> no longer live without Collins.|$|E
5|$|After {{the final}} hand, Lady Fingers {{questioned}} Howard <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{have made that}} $1000 raise, to which Howard replied that poker was all about making the wrong move at the right time. On third street, the Kid bet $1000 into a $1000 pot {{with a pair of}} 10s shows while Howard had just a Queen high. By raising $1000, Howard was possibly representing a Queen in the hole and trying to buy the pot at the point. The Kid only had to put in another $1000 into a $4000, so he was offered 4 to 1 odds, which were very favorable odds, since he only had to be right 1 in 5 times to break even. Howard seemed to be relying on implied odds to justify that raise as well as the $3000 call on fourth street.|$|E

5|$|Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{investigate}} {{the birth of}} five babies {{in the town of}} Martinsburg, West Virginia, who were born with tails. The mother of the most recent baby, Amanda Nelligan, tells the agents that the father of her baby is Luke Skywalker. By researching the baby's chromosomes it is discovered that all five share the same father. The parents of the children blame the local fertility doctor, who had used insemination to impregnate all of the mothers but Nelligan. Mulder spots a janitor nearby with signs that he formerly had a tail. When he runs Mulder chases him and catches him. The janitor, Eddie Van Blundht, is discovered to be the father of all of the children. Scully believes Eddie used a date rape drug although Mulder questions <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be in the position to give it to the women.|$|E
5|$|As {{demands for}} a {{parliament}} grew, Charles took {{the unusual step of}} summoning a great council of peers. By the time it met, on 24 September at York, Charles had resolved to follow the almost universal advice to call a parliament. After informing the peers that a parliament would convene in November, he asked them to consider <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> acquire funds to maintain his army against the Scots in the meantime. They recommended making peace. A cessation of arms, although not a final settlement, was negotiated in the humiliating Treaty of Ripon, signed in October 1640. The treaty stated that the Scots would continue to occupy Northumberland and Durham and be paid £850 per day until peace was restored and the English Parliament recalled, which would be required to raise sufficient funds to pay the Scottish forces. Consequently, Charles summoned what later became known as the Long Parliament. Once again, Charles's supporters fared badly at the polls. Of the 493 members of the Commons returned in November, over 350 were opposed to the king.|$|E
5|$|Duchesne {{now called}} on Basil Orchard and Wilfred Boothroyd {{to counter the}} defence's evidence. Orchard, another doctor from Penetanguishene, testified that Lamb had {{suddenly}} abandoned any show of amnesia during an interview in August 1966. He saw no evidence that Lamb was insane {{and said that he}} was simply a young man with strong impulses who sometimes could not control them. Boothroyd, of Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto, then spoke, arguing that Lamb had been acting out strong feelings of anger and bitterness and fully intended to kill the people he confronted, knowing and understanding what that meant. Lamb, he said, was capable of all kinds of emotion and was perfectly able {{to understand the nature of}} what he had done. Justice Stark intervened during Boothroyd's testimony, asking <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> give a reliable opinion on Lamb when he had never examined him. He also remarked that his opinion was contrary to every doctor who had testified so far.|$|E

5|$|Falko Bindrich {{was born}} on 17 October 1990 in Zittau, Germany, to parents Zdena and Oswald Bindrich. His father, Oswald Bindrich (born 1951), was an expert-level chess player, with a highest Elo rating of 2212. In 1993, {{at the age of}} three, Falko was taught chess by his brother and soon after, his father, Oswald, {{enrolled}} him the Oberland Chess Club. In 1998, he entered for the German Youth Individual Championship (under nine) and placed 28th out of 80 participants. After achieving second place in the 1999 German Youth U10 Individual Championship, he was allowed to attend the U10 European Championship where he finished only 39th. After this disappointment, he asked his father, Oswald, <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> improve, and he set him on a daily training regimen with him and later consulted with stronger German players. In late 1999, he reached 1400 Elo, whereby his training sessions were extended and held with the likes of grandmasters Lubomir Ftacnik and Zigurds Lanka.|$|E
5|$|Henry Blackwell began {{a two-year}} {{courtship}} of Stone {{in the summer}} of 1853. Stone told him she did not wish to marry because {{she did not want to}} surrender control over her life and would not assume the legal position occupied by a married woman. Blackwell maintained that despite the law, couples could create a marriage of equal partnership, governed by their mutual agreement. They could also take steps to protect the wife against unjust laws, such as placing her assets in the hands of a trustee. He also believed that marriage would allow each partner to accomplish more than he or she could alone, and to show <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> help advance Stone’s work, he arranged her highly successful western lecturing tour of 1853. Over an eighteen-month courtship conducted primarily through correspondence, Stone and Blackwell discussed the nature of marriage, actual and ideal, as well as their own natures and suitability for marriage. Stone gradually fell in love and in November 1854 agreed to marry Blackwell.|$|E
5|$|Later on {{the evening}} of 7 August, she asked Bamber whether he had done it. He said no, but that a friend of his had, whom he named; the man was a plumber the family had used in the past. Bamber {{allegedly}} said he had told this friend <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> enter and leave the farmhouse undetected, and that one of his instructions had been for the friend to telephone him from the farm on one of the phones in the house that had a memory redial facility, so that if the police checked it, it would give him an alibi. Everything had gone as planned, he said, except that Nevill had put up a fight, and the friend had become angry and shot him seven times. The friend had allegedly told Sheila to lie down and shoot herself last, Bamber said. The friend then placed the Bible on her chest so she appeared to have killed herself in a religious frenzy. The children were shot in their sleep, he said. Mugford said Bamber claimed to have paid the friend £2,000.|$|E

5|$|A Link Between Worlds {{features}} original music {{along with}} tracks from A Link to the Past. Ryo Nagamatsu composed and orchestrated new music for A Link Between Worlds, {{and played the}} flute music featured in the game's milk bar. He also composed arrangements and adapted Koji Kondo's original music from A Link to the Past. Nagamatsu wanted to balance arrangements of past music with completely new music to please both old and new players. He began by revisiting old tracks and thinking <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> best adapt them for A Link Between Worlds soundtrack. He was eager to include choral performances {{as a way to}} add tension to the eerie and unpleasant scenes in the game. Nagamatsu performed the vocals and made use of multitrack recording to layer the different vocals tracks. The audio team decided not use a live orchestra for recording the game's music, the primary reason for this was to create optimal sound for the Nintendo 3DS. The reverberations and low-pitch sounds created by a live orchestra were not suitable for the Nintendo 3DS speakers. The majority of the string music was created using a synthesizer, with Toru Minegishi playing guitar on one track.|$|E
5|$|The arcade game {{market is}} split into {{manufacturers}}, distributors, and operators; manufacturers like Atari sell game machines to distributors—who handle {{several types of}} electronic machines—who in turn sell them to the operators of locations. In the early 1970s, distributors bought games on an exclusive basis, meaning that only one distributor in each distribution region would carry products from a given arcade game manufacturer, restricting the manufacturer to only the operators that distributor sold to. Atari, in 1973 {{just over a year}} old and largely based on their hit first game Pong, felt that as a smaller manufacturer this setup severely limited their ability to sell arcade games: they could only contract with a limited number of distributors, who would only buy a limited number of games per year. To work around this, Atari set up a secret subsidiary company in September 1973, Kee Games, which was intended to sell clones of Atari's games, in effect doubling their potential reach. Kee did have its own manufacturing equipment and therefore the ability to develop original titles, however, and after several clone games lead engineer Steve Bristow developed the idea for a new title. Bristow, who had previously worked with the Atari founders on Computer Space, the first arcade video game, {{came up with the idea}} while thinking of <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> improve Computer Space. His idea to correct the perceived shortcomings of the game were to replace its difficult to control rocket ships with more straightforward tanks, and to make it a two-player game instead of a single-player one.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{concept of}} Prison Break—a man deliberately getting himself {{sent to prison}} {{in order to help}} someone escape—was suggested to Paul Scheuring by producer Dawn Parouse, who wanted to produce an action-oriented series. Although Scheuring {{thought it was a good}} idea, he was initially stumped as to why someone would embark on such a mission or <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> develop it into a viable television show. He came up with the story of the wrongfully accused brother, and began working on the plot outline and devising the characters. In 2003, he pitched the idea to the Fox Broadcasting Company but was turned down as Fox felt nervous about the long-term possibilities of such a series. He subsequently showed the concept to other channels but was also turned down as it was thought to be more suited for a film project than a television series. Prison Break was later considered as a possible 14-part miniseries, which drew the interest of Steven Spielberg before his departure due to his involvement with War of the Worlds. Thus, the miniseries never materialized. Following the huge popularity of serialized prime time television series such as Lost and 24, Fox decided to back the production in 2004. The pilot episode was filmed a year after Scheuring wrote the script.|$|E

25|$|In The Caves of Steel and its sequels (the {{first of}} which is The Naked Sun), Asimov paints a grim {{situation}} of an Earth dealing with an extremely large population, and of luxury-seeking Spacers who limit birth to permit great wealth and privacy.

25|$|A {{man from}} Baal-shalishah brought the prophet Elisha bread of the First Fruits — 20 loaves of barley — and fresh grain in his sack {{to give to}} the people to eat. Elisha's servant asked Elisha <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> feed a hundred men with these rations, but Elisha told his servant to give the food to the people, for God said that they would eat and have food left over. So the servant set the food before the men, they ate, and they had food left over, just as God had said.|$|E

A number of women and children had been spared and his thoughts turned to <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> rid himself of them. His decision was promptly reached. A trumpeter with a flag of truce was sent to summon someone to come ashore from the ships to treat of conditions of surrender. Receiving no response, he sent Jean Francois to the Pearl with the proposal that the French should have a safe-conduct to return to France with the women and children in any one vessel they should select, provided they would surrender their remaining ships and all of their armament.|$|E
25|$|According {{to persons}} interviewed at the Pansio {{reception}} centre by national broadcaster Yle, the main suspect arrived to the centre in December 2016 and displayed radicalist behaviour during his stay, such as asking <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> join the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), listening to radicalist sermons on his phone and considering Finns to be infidels. The interviewees warned the reception centre management of this behaviour in January 2017. Helsinki Times published similar interviews afterwards. Yle {{also reported that}} the police are currently monitoring approximately 100 young asylum seeker men in the Southwest Finland area and that the police believe the main suspect had radicalized fairly quickly during August; for example, his behaviour and clothing style had changed.|$|E
25|$|According to Harjinder Dilgeer {{there was}} no Pathan in the Guru's army, and story of Pir Budhu Shah sending his sons is a later concoction. Pir Budhu Shah was at Sadhaura, about 60km from Paonta; it was not {{possible}} for him to receive the news of betrayal by Pathan soldiers. Even if it is accepted, there is no explanation for <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> get the news the same day and dispatch his son from Sadhaura to Bhangani: it would mean that the battle continued for several days. Thus, he concludes that Pir Budhu Shah's story is a concoction; however, {{there is no doubt that}} Pir was an admirer of the Guru and for this 'crime' Usman Khan the chief of Sadhaura had punished (killed) the Pir and his two sons.|$|E
