5|$|In {{completing}} missions, {{the player}} can have Talion engage in melee, ranged combat, and stealth approaches, with some missions rewarding the player more for completing the mission {{in a specific}} manner. Talion's ranger abilities are enhanced through Celebrimbor, allowing the player to mix combat with special focus-based attacks; these latter attacks {{can be used to}} slow time down while aiming with the bow, drain focus out of an enemy <b>foe,</b> or, later in the game, brand the <b>foe</b> to become an ally of Talion. The combat system uses an attack-chain system that enables the player to perform special moves after building the chain to a large enough value, such as instantly draining a <b>foe</b> of focus or performing an area focus attack. With the combat system, they can also counter and dodge attacks. Stealth is a critical element in some missions; several areas are considered Strongholds and should Talion's presence be discovered, an alarm will sound and more Uruks will arrive to try to kill him.|$|E

50|$|In combat, Graz'zt {{does not}} {{hesitate}} to use his spell-like abilities, favoring charm and domineering effects to turn enemies into allies, or unholy blights to weed out lawful and good <b>foes.</b> He utilizes a quickened dispel magic {{at the start of}} any combat, attempting to catch as many of his more powerful <b>foes</b> at once, but saves the other two quickened uses for targeted dispels against <b>foes</b> with numerous defensive spells. In the second round of combat, he favors the use of tyranny to order the strongest-looking of his <b>foes</b> to fight by his side while he himself moves into melee to strike the weakest of his <b>foes</b> with his sword. Thereafter, Graz'zt prefers to fight in melee, retreating via teleportation if brought below 200 hit points. Once he recovers, he returns to finish the fight.|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} solar cycle variability on the sporadic E layer (Es), hourly measurements of the critical frequency of the Es ordinary mode of propagation, <b>foEs,</b> and of the blanketing frequency of the Es layer, fbEs, recorded from January 1976 to December 2009  at the Rome (Italy) ionospheric station (41. 8 ° N, 12. 5 ° E), were examined. The results are: (1) a high positive correlation between the F 10. 7 solar index and <b>foEs</b> {{as well as between}} F 10. 7 and fbEs, both for the whole data set and for each solar cycle separately, the correlation between F 10. 7 and fbEs being much higher than the one between F 10. 7 and foEs; (2) a decreasing long-term trend of the F 10. 7, <b>foEs</b> and fbEs time series, with <b>foEs</b> decreasing more rapidly than F 10. 7 and fbEs; (3) clear and statistically significant peaks at 11  years in the <b>foEs</b> and fbEs time series, inferred from Lomb-Scargle periodograms...|$|R

5|$|During Milhail Kogălniceanu's lifetime, {{there was}} {{confusion}} regarding his exact birth year, with several sources erroneously indicating it as 1806; {{in his speech}} to the Romanian Academy, he acknowledged this, and gave his exact birth date as present in a register kept by his father. It was also then that he mentioned his godmother was Marghioala Calimach, a Callimachi boyaress who married into the Sturdza family, and {{was the mother of}} Mihail Sturdza (Kogălniceanu's would-be protector and <b>foe).</b>|$|E
5|$|During the {{presidency}} of Richard Nixon, a US government investigation was initiated into American involvement in the assassinations. Nixon was a political <b>foe</b> of Kennedy, having narrowly lost {{to him in the}} 1960 Presidential election. Nixon ordered an investigation under E.

5|$|East Carolina, meanwhile, {{had been}} in {{first place in the}} C-USA's East Division with just two games remaining. A loss to Marshall University in that second-to-last game, however, put ECU into second place in its division, and thus out of {{competition}} for the Conference USA Championship. After winning against conference <b>foe</b> Tulane in the final game of the season, the Pirates decided to travel to the Hawaii Bowl. East Carolina ended the regular season 7–5 overall, and 6–2 in conference play.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the question to}} what extent <b>foes</b> deteriorate a person’s labor market position and block persons in their labor market position. We improve upon earlier research by explicitly focusing on {{the negative effects of}} social capital. A second way to improve upon earlier findings is to use a life-course approach. A third way to improve our knowledge regarding the influence of social capital on labor market careers is to focus explicitly on career immobility. With this research we do not only show that <b>foes</b> matter in the occupational career. We elaborate upon earlier research by the inclusion of <b>foes,</b> and we also show to what extent <b>foes</b> matter, for whom they matter and under what conditions they are especially harmful. ...|$|R
5|$|Following the {{restoration}} of the veneration of icons in March 843, the Byzantine Empire's government, headed by the Empress-regent Theodora and the logothetes Theoktistos, embarked on a sustained assault on the Byzantines' main political and ideological <b>foe,</b> the Abbasid Caliphate and its dependencies. This aggressive stance was on the one hand facilitated by the internal stability {{that the end of the}} Iconoclasm controversy brought, and on the other encouraged by a desire to vindicate the new policy through military victories against the Muslims.|$|E
5|$|However, in {{his final}} {{confrontation}} with Spider-Man, despite exposing his <b>foe</b> {{to a series of}} gases to temporarily neutralize all of his powers, and triggering an EMP to shut down all the gadgetry within his new spider-armor, Spider-Man is still able to defeat Osborn as the two clash. Managing to escape while Peter is distracted, Osborn resolves to find a means of restoring his powers, concluding that he has only ever defeated Spider-Man when allowing himself to draw on his inner demons.|$|E
5|$|In another temple ritual, the pharaoh {{played a}} {{ceremonial}} game {{in honor of}} the Eye goddesses Hathor, Sekhmet, or Tefnut, in which he struck a ball symbolizing the Eye of Apep with a club made from a type of wood that was said to have sprung from the Eye of Ra. The ritual represents, in a playful form, the battle of Ra's Eye with its greatest <b>foe.</b>|$|E
40|$|Hourly {{systematic}} {{measurements of}} the highest frequency reflected by the sporadic-E layer (<b>foEs)</b> recorded at the Rome ionospheric observatory (Italy, 41. 8 ° N, 12. 5 ° E), were considered during the period January 1976 –December 2007, to calculate the percentage of occurrence of sporadic-E layer with frequencies <b>foEs</b> greater than a given threshold value fT, P(foEs > fT). To study possible influences from solar activity, measurements of <b>foEs</b> recorded near the periods of minimum and maximum solar activity, were also considered. Measurements of <b>foEs</b> recorded for the period January 2000 –December 2007 were analysed to study the influence of magnetic activity on <b>foEs</b> occurrence frequency. The results are provided as maps showing P(foEs > fT) with <b>foEs</b> above the selected level (fT= 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 MHz), for each hour from 00. 00 L. T. to 23. 00 L. T. and for each month. The results reveal a relatively low P(foEs > fT) before sunrise and after sunset in all seasons; the most significant P(foEs > fT) occur during daytime in summer months; intense formations of sporadic-E layer occur rarely during the year; P(foEs > fT) does not depend significantly on solar and geomagnetic activity. 2009 COSPAR.

5|$|Rome was {{therefore}} forced to contend by around 340 BC against both Samnite incursions into their territory and, simultaneously, {{in a bitter}} war against their former allies. Rome bested the Latins in the Battle of Vesuvius {{and again in the}} Battle of Trifanum, after which the Latin cities were obliged to submit to Roman rule. Perhaps due to Rome's lenient treatment of their defeated <b>foe,</b> the Latins submitted largely amicably to Roman rule for the next 200 years.|$|E
