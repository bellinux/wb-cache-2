5|$|The adult annual {{survival}} {{rate in the}} UK is around 54%, and that for juveniles <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> is 53%. The typical lifespan is three years, although there are records from Great Britain and Germany of birds surviving for more than 13 years.|$|E
5|$|As campus residences {{accommodate}} just 6,400 {{students in}} all, the university guarantees housing only for undergraduates <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> of study, while most upper-year {{and graduate students}} reside off-campus. Traditionally, the adjacent neighbourhoods of The Annex and Harbord Village are popular settling grounds for University of Toronto students, forming a distinct student quarter enclave. In 2004, the university purchased and converted a nearby hotel into the Chestnut Residence, which houses students from all colleges and faculties. There are also numerous fraternity houses and student housing cooperatives, where boarders pay reduced rent for assuming housekeeping duties.|$|E

The annual survival rate is about 50% for adults and 26% for juveniles <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>year.</b> The typical lifespan is two years, but a bird in Sweden lived to tenyears and twomonths Much greater ages, up to 24years, have been recorded in captive garden warblers.|$|E

5|$|Baltimore was far {{and away}} the most {{successful}} of any American CFL team on the field and off, averaging crowds of over 37,000 their first year. Knowing that Canadian football was considerably different from the American game, Speros stocked the Stallions mostly with CFL veterans.

The result was a team that eventually finished second in the East with a 12–6 record and became the first American team to qualify for the playoffs. They advanced {{all the way to the}} Grey Cup. In a thrilling match played in BC Place, the BC Lions defeated the Stallions on a last second field goal.

Successive professors had few students until after the Second World War, when numbers increased because of {{the reputation of the}} then professor, Gibb, and because some British students became interested in Arabic culture while serving in the Middle East during the war.

5|$|Martin began curling {{when he was}} {{six years}} old. He took up the sport because his father was the vice {{president}} of his local curling club.

The rink (a group of players) finished the round robin in second place, with a win-loss record of 7–4, behind Prince Edward Island's Kent Scales.

After extracting the jersey from underneath two feet of concrete, Yankees' President Randy Levine indicated that the shirt would be donated to the Jimmy Fund to be auctioned for the charity long associated with the Red Sox.

5|$|The {{dusky shark}} {{is one of}} the most sought-after species for shark fin trade, as its fins are large and contain a high number of {{internal}} rays (ceratotrichia). In addition, the meat is sold fresh, frozen, dried and salted, or smoked, the skin is made into leather, and the liver oil is processed for vitamins. Dusky sharks are taken by targeted commercial fisheries operating off eastern North America, southwestern Australia, and eastern South Africa using multi-species longlines and gillnets. The southwestern Australian fishery began in the 1940s and expanded in the 1970s to yield 500600 tons per year. The fishery utilizes selective demersal gillnets that take almost exclusively young sharks under three years old, with 1828% of all newborns captured <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>first</b> <b>year.</b> Demographic models suggest that the fishery is sustainable, provided that the mortality rate of sharks over 2m (6.6ft) long is under 4%.|$|E
