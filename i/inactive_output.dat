From the analysis results, we only need to reserve a small amount of PS buffer space to get good performance for the entire system. Computer simulation shows the PSPP control is very robust and very close to the performance of pushout (PO) buffer management scheme which is a scheme considered as optimal in terms of fairness and total loss ratio while too complicated for implementation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- In {{a shared}} buffer packet switch, a good buffer {{management}} scheme {{will reduce the}} overall packet loss probability and improve the fairness among different output queues. In this paper, a novel buffer control scheme called threshold-based partial sharing (TPS) is proposed. The key idea of the TPS is to separate the output ports into active and <b>inactive</b> <b>output</b> ports according to whether their queue lengths are larger than the fair buffer allocation factor or not. When the remained buffer size is larger than a certain threshold value, all arrival packets are accepted. Otherwise, only the packets destined for <b>inactive</b> <b>output</b> ports are admitted to enter the shard buffer. The TPS scheme possesses the dynamic adjustability of pushout (PO) without the implementation complexity. Instead, the TPS uses a simple static threshold for control. Computer simulations are {{used to compare the}} loss performance of TPS, dynamic threshold (DT), and PO. TPS control is shown to be more robust to variation in traffic conditions than DT control and close to the loss performance of PO that is considered as optimal in terms of fairness and overall packet loss probability. key words: threshold, partial sharing, fairness, robust 1...|$|E

Based on {{the dynamic}} {{mathematical}} model of three-phase grid-connected inverter, {{two kinds of}} control strategies are compared, one is double closed loop control based on grid voltage orientation theory, the other is direct power control. According to the mathematical model of two-phase rotating coordinates of the inverter, in double closed loop control theory, the purpose of control of the inverter by decoupling control and PI control is achieved. From the point of energy on direct power control system, the active, <b>inactive</b> power of <b>output</b> AC of inverter are calculated,and suitable space voltage vector was selected after comparing with the given values to realize the direct control of the power set point. The basic theory of two control strategies and implementation method are included, and the simulation model was established based on MATLAB/Simulink. And their simulation results, characteristics of two kinds of control methods were compared through simulation data analysis. On the basic of results, the direct power control {{is better than the}} double closed loop control...|$|R
30|$|Besides the {{semantic}} types, input datapoints must be declared as either mandatory, optional, or inactive {{for a given}} operation mode. Mandatory inputs are essential for a proper functioning of the profile and must be bound with an interoperable output datapoint providing the desired information. For example, the input datapoints nv 1 (room luminance level) and nv 2 (occupancy state) in Figure 3 are mandatory for the constant light controller. Optional inputs on the contrary can be bound, but do not have to. They provide additional information, such as nv 3 (manual override from the user) or nv 4 (luminance setpoint adjustment). Inactive inputs must not be bound, {{because they are not}} regarded by the profile in the given operation mode. Output datapoints on the other hand are distinguished in active and <b>inactive.</b> Only active <b>outputs</b> provide values and are possible candidates for datapoint bindings. With that information, an automated function-block-oriented composition of building automation systems is feasible. Automated design algorithms know which operation mode of a functional profile needs to be selected for a desired functionality and which datapoints of neighbored profiles are to be bound for a proper functioning.|$|R
