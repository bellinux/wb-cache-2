25|$|The {{process of}} making the large open end (bell) of a brass {{instrument}} is called metal beating. In making the bell of, for example, a trumpet, a person lays out a pattern and shapes sheet metal into a bell-shape using templates, machine tools, handtools, and blueprints. The maker cuts out the bell blank, using hand or power shears. He hammers the blank over a bell-shaped mandrel, and butts the seam, using a notching tool. The seam is brazed, using a torch and smoothed using a hammer or file. A <b>draw</b> <b>bench</b> or arbor press equipped with expandable lead plug is used to shape and smooth the bell and bell neck over a mandrel. A lathe is used to spin the bell head and to form a bead {{at the edge of}} bell head. Previously shaped bell necks are annealed, using a hand torch to soften the metal for further bending. Scratches are removed from the bell using abrasive-coated cloth.|$|E

The pressure chamber was designed along similar lines to the pressure chambers used by previous researchers for Plasto-hydrodynamic die-less drawing of wire. The commissioning and future safe operation of the <b>drawing</b> <b>bench</b> have been described. The experimental proceedures and methods have been outlined. Investigations into {{a wide range of}} drawing conditions have been carried out. These include the polymer coating of wires of two different types of material, wires with three diameters, utilising three different dies and two different polymers. Results from these tests have been presented graphically. From the results contained in these graphs conclusions have been drawn and an outline for further research has been proposed...|$|R

40|$|So many {{facets of}} hot wire drawing process, despite its {{extensive}} and long time {{employment in the}} industries, still remain unclear, due to want of systematic investigation of the process. This work investigated the influence of formulated neem seed and jatropha seed oil as lubricants, using antimony dialkyl dithiocarbamates (ADTC) as an additive, on wire drawing process. The suitability of the bio-based oils in friction and wear control during wire drawing process were investigated, using a four ball tester. Experimental drawing process, using a Tungsten Carbide die and the formulated lubricants was carried out on mild steel and medium carbon steel rod (6 and 8 mm diameter respectively) at temperatures from 20 OC to 750 OC, on a <b>drawing</b> <b>bench.</b> The stresses and the temperature distribution profiles along the work-piece were reported. Up to 45 % of reductions in area, without wire fracture, achieved on the drawing of the medium carbon steel have equally been reported...|$|R
5000|$|When drawing, {{the plate}} is held {{securely}} in a vise or other fixture. Annealed wire is filed {{at one end}} to give it an initial taper. The tapered end is inserted into a hole with a final diameter just smaller than its current width. Special pliers, called draw tongs are used to hold {{the tip of the}} wire and pull it through, sometimes with the aid of grease or wax as a lubricant. Small diameter wire may be drawn manually, while very thick wire may require a <b>drawing</b> <b>bench</b> with a crank. Often, a wire can be drawn three times in a row before it needs to be re-annealed. This must be done because drawing wire work-hardens it, which causes the wire to become brittle. Brittle wire that has not been annealed may snap during the drawing process (or develop microscopic or macroscopic cracks, which may weaken the piece or [...] "grow" [...] with further working).|$|R

40|$|One {{objective}} of Bureau of Mines recycling {{research is to}} devise technology that enables recovery of metals and minerals from wastes. From October 1982 through September 1985, researchers at the Bureau and at the University of Missouri Rolla (contract H 0222002) investigated the use of nonferrous flue dust with varying Zn contents (11 to 66 pct) {{as a source of}} Zn for electrogalvanizing steel wire. The waste dusts used were from a secondary Cu smelter, a brass smelter, a Pb smelter, and a water treatment plant. The dusts were leached in H 2 S 04, and the leach solutions were treated to make electrolyte for electrogalvanizing steel wire using soluble Zn anodes. Cyclic voltammetry was used in an inno-vative method to evaluate the quality of the electrolytes used for elec-rogalvanizing. After electrogalvanizing, the wire was drawn on a labo-ratory <b>draw</b> <b>bench</b> to simulate industrial practice. Corrosion resistance was measured by a number of electrochemical techniques and by the stan-dard ASTM salt-spray tests. After successful bench-scale tests, the process was demonstrated in an industrial pilot plant. Results indicate that nonferrous flue dusts {{can be used as a}} source of Zn for electro-galvanizing if certain impurities are either partially or completely removed from the starting electrolyte...|$|E

He complied with forced grimace, but with fear and trembling; sitting on the edge of his bench; supping down heartburn with every drop of liquor; eyeing ruefully the black muzzled pistols, and cold, naked stilettos. They pushed the bottle bravely, and plied him vigorously; sang, laughed, told excellent stories of robberies and combats, and the little doctor was fain to laugh at these cut-throat pleasantries, though his heart was dying away at the very bottom of his bosom.|$|R

40|$|Three <b>draw</b> <b>bench</b> {{tests in}} axial {{direction}} were conducted of {{the pull out}} forces in predrilled human condylar bone of one single meniscus Arrow, one single metal screw, and three Meniscus Arrows in one bone block, the Arrows being inserted using the standard hand instruments. Bone blocks with three meniscus Arrows were tested additionally in tangential direction, imitating shear forces. All observed values were {{within the range of}} 1 standard error (SE) or higher and exceeded the values in meniscal tissue as reported in the literature. These are much higher than the shear force during a single movement in the human knee. Most metallic devices used for fixation of the fragments in the treatment of osteochondritis dissecans must be removed in a second operation. Left in place, as with the Herbert screws, they can disturb future imaging and damage the opposite cartilage of the tibia plateau. Staples left in place can break. Finally, some metals evoke allergic reactions and, at least in animals, are potent carcinogens. Although fusion of osteochondritis dissecans fragments in their original locations fixed with noncompressive biodegradable pins has been reported, these tests show the hold of compressive meniscus Arrows in bone to contribute to a better result than noncompressive pins. Other biodegradable devices are also available for this application. However, one advantage is that using meniscus Arrows, already available in the hospital for mending ruptured menisci, saves the costs of investing in other sets of instruments and devices. Another advantage is the smaller diameter of the meniscus Arrows than that of other biodegradable devices, resulting in less damage to the fragments...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} of manufacturing processes has become {{in the last}} years an important tool to improve these processes reducing lead times and try out, and providing products free of defects and with controlled mechanical properties. Finite Element Method (FEM) {{is one of the most}} important methods to simulate metal forming. In tube drawing with fixed plug both the outer diameter and the inner diameter of the tube are properly defined if correct process conditions are chosen for the die angle, drawing speed, lubrication and area reduction per pass. These conditions have great influence on drawing loads and residual stresses present in the product. In this work, the cold drawing of tubes with fixed plug was simulated by FEM with the commercial software MSC. Superform to find the best geometry of die and plug to reduce the drawing force. The numerical analysis supplied results for the reactions of the die and plug and the stresses in the tube, the drawing force and the final dimensions of the product. Those results are compared with results obtained from analytic models, and used tooling design.

There he sat, his very indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits. Wild he was; a very sight of sights to see; yet I began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him. And those same things that would have repelled most others, they were the very magnets that thus drew me. I'll try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy. I <b>drew</b> my <b>bench</b> near him, and made some friendly signs and hints, doing my best {{to talk with him}} meanwhile.

40|$|Research in {{discourse}} analysis {{has demonstrated that}} power can be illuminated through analyzing discourses. Centered {{on the notion that}} power and legitimation go hand-in-hand, these discourses are distinguished by specific linguistic components. One of the ways to explore how legitimation is tranquilized is to scrutinize its discourses, which some scholars (Wang, 2006; Van Leeuwen, 2007) argue have the precedence to control some of everyday, social, and public spheres. Following this premise, this paper examines how legitimation is jostled in selected decision-making scenes in a popular syndicated three-judge panel TV court show, Hot Bench. Two objectives are set out for this study; firstly to examine how organization and resolution of cases are generally settled and secondly to identify the types of legitimation employed by the judges in their decision-making processes. Premiered in 2014, Hot <b>Bench</b> <b>draws</b> over 2 million viewers in October 2014, jumping to a staggering 2. 5 million viewers in November 2014, emerging {{as one of the most}} watched syndicated legal reality TV programs in United States of America with its second season renewed through 2017. By analyzing selected conversations by judges who deliberate verdicts, this study which employs Van Leeuwenâs framework of legitimation concludes that the judges typically employ three types of legitimation, namely, authorization, moral evaluation, and rationalization over the course of adjudicating TVâs court proceedings. This study ultimately contributes to the broader field of {{discourse analysis}} by tapping onto the belief that language, through discourse analysis, serves as a vehicle within which specific discourse community maintains power...|$|R
6000|$|I {{believe that}} Thackeray fancied {{that he had}} spoken well of George III., and am {{sure that it was}} his {{intention}} to do so. But the impression he leaves is poor. [...] "He is said not to have cared for Shakespeare or tragedy much; farces and pantomimes were his joy;--and especially when clown swallowed a carrot or a string of sausages, he would laugh so outrageously that the lovely princess by his side would have to say, 'My gracious monarch, do compose yourself.' 'George, be a king!' were the words which she,"--his mother,--"was ever croaking in the ears of her son; and a king the simple, stubborn, affectionate, bigoted man tried to be." [...] "He did his best; he worked according to his lights; what virtues he knew he tried to practise; what knowledge he could master he strove to acquire." [...] If the lectures were to be popular, it was absolutely necessary that they should be written in this strain. A lecture simply laudatory on the life of St. Paul would not <b>draw</b> even the <b>bench</b> of bishops to listen to it; but were a flaw found in the apostle's life, the whole Church of England would be bound to know all about it. I am quite sure that Thackeray believed every word that he said in the lectures, and that he intended to put in the good and the bad, honestly, as they might come to his hand. We may be quite sure that he did not intend to flatter the royal family;--equally sure that he would not calumniate. There were, however, so many difficulties to be encountered that I cannot but think that the subject was ill-chosen. In making them so amusing as he did and so little offensive great ingenuity was shown.|$|R
