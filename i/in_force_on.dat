The division launched a reconnaissance <b>in</b> <b>force</b> <b>on</b> the Voëvre Plain, but before it could begin a full assault, the Allies signed an Armistice ending hostilities. After 33 days on the front lines, the 7th Division suffered 1,988 casualties. It was awarded one campaign streamer for Lorraine. The brigade performed occupation duties for the next year as it began preparations to return to the continental United States.|$|E

5|$|The British mustered an {{overwhelming}} force under Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane and Lieutenant-General George Beckwith, who collected 29 ships and 10,000 men – almost {{four times the}} number of French regular forces garrisoning Martinique. Landing <b>in</b> <b>force</b> <b>on</b> both the southern and northern coasts of the island, British troops pushed inland, defeating French regulars in the central highlands and routing local militia units in the south of the island. By 9 February, the entire island was in British hands except Fort Desaix, a powerful position intended to protect the capital Fort-de-France, which had been bypassed during the British advance. In a siege lasting 15 days the Fort was constantly bombarded, the French suffering 200 casualties before finally surrendering.|$|E
5|$|Charles X died in February 1660. Three months later, the Treaty of Copenhagen {{ended the}} war. Charles' son and successor, Charles XI, was only five {{when his father}} died, so a regency council—led by the queen mother Hedvig Eleonora—assumed power until he came of age. Sweden had come close to control over trade in the Baltic, but the war {{revealed}} the need to prevent {{the formation of a}} powerful anti-Swedish alliance that included Denmark. There were some successes in foreign policy, notably the anti-French Triple Alliance of England, Sweden, and the Dutch Republic. By early 1672, Sweden had improved its relations with France enough to form an alliance. The same year, King Louis XIV attacked the Dutch Republic, and in 1674 Sweden was pressured into joining the war by attacking the Republic's northern German allies. France promised to pay Sweden desperately needed war subsidies on condition that it moved <b>in</b> <b>force</b> <b>on</b> Brandenburg. A Swedish army of 22,000 men under Carl Gustaf Wrangel advanced into Brandenburg in December 1674 and suffered a minor tactical defeat at the Battle of Fehrbellin in June 1675. Though not militarily significant, the defeat tarnished the reputation of near-invincibility that Swedish arms had enjoyed since the Thirty Years' War. This emboldened Sweden's enemies, and by September 1675 Denmark, the Dutch Republic and the Holy Roman Empire were at war with Sweden and France.|$|E
5|$|In 1672, French King Louis XIV {{launched}} {{an attack on}} the Dutch Republic, igniting the Franco-Dutch War. The attack was opposed by the Holy Roman Empire led by Leopold I. In 1674, Sweden was pressured into joining the war by attacking the Republic's northern German allies. France promised to pay Sweden desperately needed war subsidies only on the condition that it moved <b>in</b> <b>force</b> <b>on</b> Brandenburg. A Swedish army of around 22,000 men under Carl Gustaf Wrangel advanced into Brandenburg in December 1674 and suffered a minor tactical defeat at the Battle of Fehrbellin in June 1675. Though not militarily significant, the defeat tarnished the reputation of near-invincibility that Sweden had enjoyed since the Thirty Years' War and emboldened its enemies. By September 1675, Denmark, the Dutch Republic, the Holy Roman Empire and Spain were all joined in war against Sweden and its ally France.|$|E

5|$|In Japan, the United States {{military}} and its navy took precautions against the approaching storm. Okinawa was put under Tropical Cyclone Condition of Readiness (TCCOR) 1-E, {{which means that}} all outdoor activities are prohibited as there are sustained winds of at least 50knots (95km/h, 60mph) <b>in</b> <b>force,</b> <b>on</b> September 16, with over 100 flights {{into and out of}} Naha International Airport on the island cancelled. Kadena Air Base moved various aircraft to other undisclosed locations in the Pacific. Sasebo Naval Base declared TCCOR 1-E on September 17. The USS Harpers Ferry (LSD-49) and USS Juneau (LPD-10) both left the base, while the USS Patriot (MCM-7) was moved to a wet berth. Only one vessel, the USS Tortuga (LSD-46) remained in port for repairs, because authorities thought that the ship could withstand the storm. Elsewhere in Japan, some flights and Shinkansen bullet trains were delayed or cancelled. In Miyazaki and Hiroshima prefectures, evacuation orders were issued for almost 170 families. In Kyūshū, 10,000people voluntarily evacuated their houses for higher ground. The island's seven main airports were closed, causing 41,900 passengers to be stranded when 357 flights were cancelled. Ahead of an expected landfall on Hokkaidō, the JMA warned residents of the possibility of high winds.|$|E
5|$|The Presidential Council for Minority Rights (PCMR) is a non-elected {{government}} body in Singapore established in 1970, the main function {{of which is}} to scrutinize most of the bills passed by Parliament to ensure that they do not discriminate against any racial or religious community. If the Council feels that any provision in a bill amounts to a differentiating measure, it will report its findings to Parliament and refer the bill back to Parliament for reconsideration. The Council also examines subsidiary legislation and statutes <b>in</b> <b>force</b> <b>on</b> 9 January 1970. One member of the PCMR is nominated by the Chairman to the Presidential Elections Committee, which is empowered to ensure that candidates for the office of President have the qualifications required by the Constitution. The President also appoints and dismisses the chairman and members of the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony ("PCRH"), established by the , on the advice of the PCMR, and the PCMR is responsible for determining whether PCRH members who are not representatives of major religions in Singapore have distinguished themselves in public service or community relations in Singapore.|$|E

25|$|During {{the same}} year, Russia and Switzerland {{concluded}} a trade agreement {{in which they}} granted each other most-favoured-nation status concerning intellectual property rights, i.e., they agreed to grant the other treaty partner automatically and without conditions any trade advantage they'd grant a third country.

In a comprehensive trade treaty with the European Union that was signed on June 24, 1994, Russia granted this most-favoured-nation status also to the EU member countries, excepting only trade advantages granted amongst the successor states of the USSR and also those Russia would grant a third country on an effective reciprocal basis. Because the ratification of this treaty was delayed as {{it had to be}} ratified by all EU members, an interim agreement containing only the provisions on intellectual property and the most-favoured-nation status was signed on July 17, 1995.
