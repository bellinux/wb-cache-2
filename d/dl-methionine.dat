40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the biological effectiveness of liquid methionine hydroxy analog free acid (MHA-FA) relative to <b>DL-methionine</b> for growing pigs. Two N-balance trials were conducted using a total of 42 barrows (Large White x Landrace). The initial body weight was 11. 73 ? 1. 05 kg in the first trial and 13. 69 ? 1. 48 kg in the second. In each trial, 21 pigs were randomly assigned to one of seven dietary treatments with three observations per treatment. The diets included a methionine-deficient basal diet with all other essential nutrients meeting the pig?s requirements and six diets formulated with graded levels of <b>DL-methionine</b> (0. 03, 0. 06 and 0. 09 %) or MHA-FA (0. 034, 0. 068 and 0. 102 %) added on an equimolar basis. Each trial lasted 12 days, consisting of an adaptation period of 7 days followed by a 5 -day total collection of urine and feces. During the collection period, pigs were fed (630 g d 1 for the first trial and 669 g/d for the second) three times (0800, 1500, and 2200 h) daily. Pigs had ad libitum access to water after feeding. Pigs receiving the experimental diets achieved higher daily gain and lower feed conversion than those receiving the basal diet. At each inclusion level, the treatment with added <b>DL-methionine</b> was superior to the corresponding treatment with added MHA-FA. The concentration of plasma urea nitrogen for pigs receiving the supplemental methionine sources, regardless of form, was lower than that for pigs receiving the basal diet. For each treatment, N retention and percentage of N retained were higher and urinary N production was lower than that of the basal diet. N retention in the experimental diets increased as the level of methionine equivalents increased. Additionally, at each inclusion rate, all treatments with <b>DL-methionine</b> supplementation showed a higher N retention but a lower plasma urea nitrogen concentration than the corresponding treatments with MHA-FA. An exponential model was used to determine the bioefficacy of MHA-FA relative to <b>DL-methionine,</b> and this model was a good fit for the responses.

40|$|The {{inhibition}} of some glutamate metabolic pathways {{could lead to}} diminished parasite survival. In this study, the effects of L-methionine sulfoximine (MS), <b>DL-methionine</b> sulfone (MSO), and <b>DL-methionine</b> sulfoxide (MSE), three glutamate analogs, on several biological processes were evaluated. We found that these analogs inhibited the growth of epimastigotes cells and showed a synergistic effect with stress conditions such as temperature, nutritional starvation, and oxidative stress. The specific activity for the reductive amination of α-ketoglutaric acid, catalyzed by the NADP+-linked glutamate dehydrogenase, showed {{an increase in the}} NADP+ levels, when MS, MSE, and MSO were added. It suggests an eventual conversion of the compounds tested by the T. cruzi cells. The fact that trypomastigote bursting was not significantly inhibited when infected cells were treated with these compounds, remarks the existence of relevant metabolic differences among the different life-cycle stages. It must be considered when proposing a new therapeutic drug...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the comparative efficacy of <b>DL-methionine</b> and herbal methionine on performance and carcass characteristics of broiler chickens. Two thousand and four hundred d-old commercial broiler (VenCobb) chicks were purchased and randomly divided into four dietary treatment groups of 600 birds each. Each treatment group was further subdivided into three replicates of 200 broilers per replicate. The treatments groups were control; control plus 10 g DL-methionine/kg diet; control plus 10 g herbal methionine (Herbomethion ®, supplied by Indian Research and Supply Co. Ltd.) /kg diet and control plus 15 g herbal methionine/kg diet. There were significant effects of dietary treatments on body weight, body weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio at 0 to 41 day. The body weight and body weight gain of the broilers fed the 15 g herbal methionine/kg diet were heavier than other treatments. Feed conversion ratio of broiler fed 15 g herbal methionine/kg diet was significantly better than that of broilers fed on 10 g herbal methionine or DL-methionine/kg diet. Neither <b>DL-methionine</b> nor herbal methionine supplementation {{had a significant effect}} on broiler mortality. Plasma protein and enzyme concentration was unaffected by the dietary treatments. Abdominal fat (%) and liver lipid (g/kg) was significantly decreased by the addition of 15 g herbal methionine/kg diet. This study demonstrates that herbal methionine can replace <b>DL-methionine</b> very effectively when used at the rate 15 g/kg diet of commercial broiler chicken...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} {{the expression of}} the mRNA of avian uncoupling protein (avUCP), of adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), and of cytochrome c oxidase subunit III (COX III), as well as the performance of broilers fed diets containing two sources and two levels of industrial methionine. Broilers between 22 and 42 days of age were distributed into five treatments (basal diet, supplementation of 0. 08 % <b>dl-methionine,</b> 0. 24 % of <b>dl-methionine,</b> 0. 11 % of MHA-FA and 0. 33 % of MHA-FA). At the end of the experimental period, birds were sacrificed by neck dislocation and their liver and breast muscle were collected for total RNA extraction. The cDNA was amplified using primers specific for the target genes, and expression was analyzed using the real-time polymerase reaction (qRT-PCR). Methionine supplementation promoted better performance, with the second level (0. 24 %) of <b>dl-methionine</b> promoting the best results for weight gain. The mRNA avUCP concentration was significantly lower in the muscle of birds fed methionine-supplemented diets, independently of source or level. The highest mRNA avUCP expression was obtained with the basal diet, which also resulted in the worst feed efficiency. The expression of mRNA avUCP in the liver and of mRNA COX III and mRNA ANT in the liver and in the muscle was not influenced by methionine supplementation. Methionine supplementation promotes better broiler performance, and the most efficient birds were fed second level of supplementation of both sources, part of these results {{may be due to the}} lower expression of avUCP mRNA in the muscle, which was also lower in birds fed diets with higher amounts of methionine...|$|E
