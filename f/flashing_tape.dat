50|$|Typically, videographers are {{distinguished}} from cinematographers {{in that they}} use digital hard-drive, <b>flash</b> cards or <b>tape</b> drive video cameras vs. 70mm IMAX, 35mm, 16mm or Super 8mm mechanical film cameras. Videographers manage smaller, event scale productions (commercials, documentaries, legal depositions, live events, short films, training videos, weddings), differing from individualized large production team members. The advent of high definition digital video cameras, however, has blurred this distinction.|$|R
50|$|File {{systems can}} be used on {{numerous}} different types of storage devices that use different kinds of media. The most common storage device in use today is a hard disk drive. Other kinds of media that are used include <b>flash</b> memory, magnetic <b>tapes,</b> and optical discs. In some cases, such as with tmpfs, the computer's main memory (random-access memory, RAM) is used to create a temporary file system for short-term use.|$|R
50|$|IBM Spectrum Storage {{portfolio}} can centrally manage {{more than}} 300 different storage devices and yottabytes of data. This device interoperability is the broadest {{in the industry}} - incorporating both IBM and non-IBM hardware and tape systems. IBM Spectrum Storage can help reduce storage costs up to 90 percent in certain environments by automatically moving data onto the most economical storage device - either from IBM or non-IBM <b>flash,</b> disk and <b>tape</b> systems.|$|R
5000|$|Network Direct Attached Storage (NDAS) is a {{proprietary}} {{storage area network}} system, originally marketed by the company Ximeta, for connecting external digital storage devices such as hard-disks, <b>flash</b> memory and <b>tape</b> drives via the Ethernet family of computer networks. Unlike other more common forms of networked storage, NDAS does not use TCP/IP to communicate over the network. Instead a Lean Packet Exchange (LPX) protocol is used. [...] NDAS also supports some limited RAID functions such as aggregation and mirroring.|$|R
25|$|With {{the aid of}} the {{firmware}} and device drivers, the kernel {{provides the}} most basic level of control over all of the computer's hardware devices. It manages memory access for programs in the RAM, it determines which programs get access to which hardware resources, it sets up or resets the CPU's operating states for optimal operation at all times, and it organizes the data for long-term non-volatile storage with file systems on such media as disks, <b>tapes,</b> <b>flash</b> memory, etc.|$|R
25|$|The {{applications}} of current data tape cartridges hardly overlap those of <b>flash</b> drives: on <b>tape,</b> cost per gigabyte {{is very low}} for large volumes, but the individual drives and media are expensive. Media {{have a very high}} capacity and very fast transfer speeds, but store data sequentially and are very slow for random access of data. While disk-based backup is now the primary medium of choice for most companies, tape backup is still popular for taking data off-site for worst-case scenarios and for very large volumes (more than a few hundreds of TB). See LTO tapes.|$|R
50|$|In computing, data {{recovery}} {{is a process}} of salvaging (retrieving) inaccessible, lost, corrupted, damaged or formatted data from secondary storage, removable media or files, when the data stored in them cannot be accessed in a normal way. The data is most often salvaged from storage media such as internal or external hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), USB <b>flash</b> drives, magnetic <b>tapes,</b> CDs, DVDs, RAID subsystems, and other electronic devices. Recovery may be required due to physical damage to the storage devices or logical damage to the file system that prevents it from being mounted by the host operating system (OS).|$|R
5000|$|Nero was {{the second}} attempt by the Qwardians to take down the new Green Lantern Kyle Rayner, the first being Fatality. In order to find someone with the same {{imagination}} and artistic skill as Rayner the Qwardians found Nero, who {{had a history of}} drawing violent and dark pictures in his asylum. Nero was designed as the [...] "archenemy" [...] of Kyle Rayner, seeing how both are artists with limitless imagination. He escaped from the asylum only to be confronted by a combination of both the original Green Lantern Alan Scott and Kyle Rayner. A battle ensued and Alan Scott was seriously wounded by Nero, forcing Kyle to retreat and call upon the assistance of the JLA. Kyle Rayner asked the JLA not only to stop Nero but to be prepared to kill him, reasoning that Nero's ring {{was one of the most}} powerful weapons in the universe and his insanity made him a profound threat. While the JLA declined his request, they were unable to stop him in several skirmishes of hit-and-run. In the end, the <b>Flash</b> found <b>tapes</b> of his parents and Kyle played the images. Eventually, the images consumed Nero, traumatising him and resulting in his defeat.|$|R
40|$|Teaching {{media is}} very {{important}} for autism to compensate the lack of interest in other people that sometimes appear to be an actual version contact with human being. Media used in teaching learning process are varied. However, the teachers should thoroughly familiarize subject area in which student are interested in. Student will be encouraged during this development phase to seek and use a variety of media relevant to their studies. The purposes of this study were to provide adequate answers to the questions concerning with the research, they were: (1) To know the teaching media used by teacher to teach verbal intermediate autistic student. (2) To know the teacher’s reasons for using the media to teach verbal intermediate autistic students. The subject of the study was the teacher in verbal intermediate autistic student in “Laboratorium Sekolah Autis” State University of Malang. The data were collected through observation and interview. Therefore, this study was descriptive qualitative research. The finding shows that the media used by the teachers were those used for normal student. The teacher gave the students three kinds of media: visual, audio and audiovisual. The media used by the teacher in teaching verbal autism were pictures, whiteboard, <b>flash</b> cards, model, <b>tape</b> recorder, puppets, real object, computer and television. The autism students are unable to process the input as normal children. Media {{is very important}} for autism to composite the lack interest in other people, the teacher used sequence of simple picture telling about activities. Autism couldn’t communicate in two-way communications; mostly they use one- way communication. To overcome this, the teacher used the media such as model, picture, table, whiteboard, flash card, and real things, to help autism students involve in two- way communication...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to descriptive study on the implementation of the teaching reading to the tenth grade students of Senior High School of Assalaam Surakarta in 2012 / 2013 Academic Year. The writer focuses the study on some dimensions, they are: 1) Curriculum, including about Competence-Standard of English Lesson for SMA, Basic Competence, syllabus, and material, 2) Method of teaching, that consists of student’s role and teacher’s role, 3) Learning media, 4) Evaluation system, and 5) Environment. The last is the strengths and the weaknesses of the teaching reading skills implementation. In this study, the writer uses descriptive qualitative researchas the proper method to describe the implementation of the current curriculum in English teaching since the descriptive research aims at providing as accurately as possible of what current practice is; how learners do learn; how teachers do teach; what classroom looks like; at particular moment in particular place. This research called qualitative reseacrh because it was relying on the collection of qualitative data. The result of the observation in teaching learning process of English the writer finds that the process of teaching and learning is task-based instructions. The teacher gives more explanation, so the teacher becomes the counselor. There are three steps of teaching and learning activities, namely; opening, study session (the explanation), and closing, 2) To support this curriculum in the teaching learning process, the teacher uses some learning media, they are; <b>flash</b> card, internet, <b>tape</b> recorder, and television. Therefore, the writer concludes that the implementation of the material is still less, many examples of the material does not transfer maximally, 3) The writer finds that the students tend to be active in the class, when the teacher starts the teaching learning process, the students are just listening to the teacher’s explanation about the material. Based on the research finding, there are strengths on the teaching reading. The first it had good procedural steps on teaching learning process. The second, the teacher applies an interesting system in order to attract the student’s attention. And the weaknesses are the first, the teacher is more focus on the written form, then the teacher holds the remedial test for all of the students without any exception. So that the students get bored and not interested, that makes the students lazy to learn and participate. Hence, it is necessary that the teachers always rehearse how to manage themselves prior to teaching in the class...|$|R
