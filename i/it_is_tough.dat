500|$|Arsenal {{were drawn}} in Group B, along with Italian club Inter Milan, Lokomotiv Moscow of Russia and Ukraine's Dynamo Kyiv. Wenger {{believed}} the trips to Eastern Europe threatened his team's {{chances of winning}} the Premier League: [...] "The other English teams have more comfortable groups than we do. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>tough</b> to go to Russia – I always {{say that if you}} have to travel more than two hours it is difficult. Sometimes the players pay a high price in the games that follow the Champions League matches." ...|$|E
500|$|The white gills can be adnate or adnexed; that is, {{they can}} be {{attached}} to the stem by their whole depth, or only part of it. The individual gills are distantly spaced, with between 8 and 12 reaching the stem. Each gill is up to [...] thick, and the edges are even. There are sometimes lamellulae (short gills that do not reach the cap). There is a thin layer, up to [...] thick, of whitish flesh in the cap. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>tough,</b> but it can be bent without breaking. The flesh has no smell or taste.|$|E

500|$|Kill the Irishman {{received}} mixed-to-positive {{reviews from}} film critics. Giving the film a positive review, Mike LaSalle, of the San Francisco Chronicle, said; [...] "What makes this film special and memorable is {{the character of}} Danny Greene, who is not the usual neighborhood hoodlum you see in movies, the kind who gets in deep and gradually loses his soul". Marshall Fine, of the Huffington Post, gave the film a mixed review. He criticized it for jumping through different events in a [...] "jerky fashion", but summed up the review by calling it a [...] "movie {{with a lot of}} meat on the bone, even if some of <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>tough</b> or stringy. It's not fancy, but it's always tasty".|$|E
500|$|Gills are {{attached}} to a collar, never to the stem, although some specimens have the collar pressed close enough to it that this characteristic may be less obvious. Widely spaced, {{they have the same}} whitish to pale yellow color as the flesh, and typically number between 16 and 22. They are initially narrow, but thicken downward to about 1–3mm at the exposed edge. The stem is [...] long and up to [...] thick, with a smooth, sometimes shiny surface. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>tough,</b> hollow, and either straight or with some curving. The color is blackish-brown up to a lighter, almost translucent apex. The base of the stem may be connected to dark brown or black root-like rhizomorphs 0.1–0.3mm thick. Mature specimens display no veil.|$|E
500|$|The cap is conical to bell-shaped, {{flattening}} in age, {{and reaches}} {{a diameter of}} [...] The cap margin is usually bent inwards initially. The cap surface is initially covered with tiny white hairs, but later becomes smooth. It is slightly hygrophanous, and when moist, is slightly translucent, so that {{the outline of the}} gills underneath are apparent. Its color is dark purple in the center, fading to pale lilac at the margins; older specimens are purplish-gray. [...] The flesh is thin and pliant, with a texture similar to cartilage. It is initially purplish-gray, becoming pale lilac to white in age. The odor and taste of the flesh are not distinctive. The narrow gills have an ascending attachment to the stipe and are narrowly adnate. They are somewhat closely spaced, with pallid to grayish face color and dark grayish purple edges that are sometimes fringed. The tubular stipe measures [...] long by 1–2mm thick. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>tough</b> and cartilaginous, and its base it covered with white hairs. Overall, its color is that of the cap or paler, and often paler near the top. The edibility of the mushroom is unknown.|$|E

500|$|The band's follow-up, Even If It Kills Me (2007), was {{recorded}} in New York City with Eli Janney and Adam Schlesinger of Fountains of Wayne, and Ric Ocasek of the Cars. The group, though big fans of his work, were disappointed with Ocasek's role. [...] "He just confused me the whole time," [...] said Pierre later, who noted that {{he was afraid to}} disclose that the experience was a [...] "bum-out." [...] Pierre struggled with writer's block during the sessions and found himself writing lyrics while recording the songs, which he had never done before. The band was also worried their songs would not be catchy enough after their last album was so successful. During this time, Pierre's substance abuse nearly disbanded the group. [...] "I think it's an understatement to say <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>tough</b> to be tied to Justin's emotions," [...] Cain later remarked. Following completion of the album, Pierre entered a three-week rehabilitation program for alcohol and drug abuse. The band was apart for a six-week stretch in the summer of 2007, marking their longest break apart in five years. [...] "It might sound cliched, but we all had a chance to do some growing up," [...] said Cain.|$|E

500|$|Kevin Shirley, who {{has worked}} with the bands Iron Maiden and Dream Theater, {{produced}} the DVD. He issued a statement describing the demanding mixing process which took place at his New York Studio: [...] "It's OK — some places it rocks hard, and others are a bit sloppy, but I'm sure they won't use the whole concert. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>tough</b> to mix." [...] The following day Shirley apologized for his [...] "unprofessional comment" [...] towards the band, and altered his post on his personal website to read: [...] "The rest of the week I finished mixing a live Slayer set for a DVD, in stereo and surround, and it's great — it rocks hard, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>tough</b> to mix." ...|$|R
