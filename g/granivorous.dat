5|$|Seeds {{and fruit}} form the major {{component}} of the diets of pigeons and doves. In fact, the family {{can be divided into}} the seed-eating or <b>granivorous</b> species (subfamily Columbinae) and the fruit-and-mast-eating or frugivorous species (the other four subfamilies). The <b>granivorous</b> species typically feed on seed found on the ground, whereas the frugivorous species tend to feed in trees. There are morphological adaptations {{that can be used to}} distinguish between the two groups: granivores tend to have thick walls in their gizzards, intestines, and esophagi whereas the frugivores tend to have thin walls. In addition, fruit-eating species have short intestines whereas those that eat seeds have longer ones. Frugivores are capable of clinging to branches and even hang upside down to reach fruit.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of {{the family}} is variable. <b>Granivorous</b> species tend to have dull plumage, with a few exceptions, whereas the frugivorous species have brightly {{coloured}} plumage. The Ptilinopus (fruit doves) {{are some of the}} brightest-coloured pigeons, with the three endemic species of Fiji and the Indian Ocean Alectroenas being the brightest. Pigeons and doves may be sexually monochromatic or dichromatic. In addition to bright colours, pigeons may sport crests or other ornamentation.|$|E
5|$|It has a {{low rate}} of fruiting, with less than 1% of flowers {{developing}} into follicles, {{and more than half}} of the inflorescences failing to form any follicles at all. Seed survival rates are similarly low. More than half of a plant's seed crop may be lost to the larvae of moths and weevils, which burrow into the cobs to eat the seeds and pupate in the follicles; and further seed losses are caused by <b>granivorous</b> birds such as cockatoos, which break off the cobs to eat both the seeds and the insect larvae.|$|E
5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} is a diurnal feeder. According to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, {{the species}} {{is one of the}} strictest vegetarians in the bird world. It is mainly <b>granivorous,</b> but will occasionally eat insects, which are also fed to its young to provide protein. Its diet consists of the seeds {{from a wide variety of}} annual plants, often those of weeds, grasses, and trees, such as thistle, teasel, dandelion, ragweed, mullein, cosmos, goatsbeard, sunflower, and alder. However, it also consumes tree buds, maple sap, and berries. It will eat at bird feeders provided by humans, particularly in the winter months, preferring Niger seed (commonly and erroneously called thistle seed).|$|E
5|$|The adult jaguar is an apex predator, {{meaning it}} exists {{at the top}} of its food chain and is not preyed on in the wild. The jaguar has also been termed a {{keystone}} species, as it is assumed, through controlling the population levels of prey such as herbivorous and <b>granivorous</b> mammals, apex felids maintain the structural integrity of forest systems. However, accurately determining what effect species like the jaguar have on ecosystems is difficult, because data must be compared from regions where the species is absent as well as its current habitats, while controlling for the effects of human activity. It is accepted that mid-sized prey species undergo population increases {{in the absence of the}} keystone predators, and this has been hypothesized to have cascading negative effects. However, field work has shown this may be natural variability and the population increases may not be sustained. Thus, the keystone predator hypothesis is not accepted by all scientists.|$|E

25|$|Golden mice are <b>granivorous</b> and eat mostly seeds. They forage among {{trees for}} buds, berries, seeds, fruits, leaves, and some insects. It prefers sumac seeds and honeysuckle. They also consume berries from plants like dogwood, greenbrier, {{blackberry}} and wild cherry.|$|E
25|$|The Eurasian teal usually feeds by dabbling, upending or grazing; it may {{submerge}} {{its head}} and on occasion even dive to reach food. In the breeding season it eats mainly aquatic invertebrates, such as crustaceans, insects and their larvae, molluscs and worms. In winter, it shifts to a largely <b>granivorous</b> diet, feeding on seeds of aquatic plants and grasses, including sedges and grains. Diurnal throughout the breeding season, in winter they are often crepuscular or even nocturnal feeders.|$|E
25|$|The role of {{some species}} of birds as pests has been well known, {{particularly}} in agriculture. <b>Granivorous</b> birds such as the queleas in Africa {{are among the most}} numerous birds in the world and foraging flocks can cause devastation. Many insectivorous birds are also noted as beneficial in agriculture. Many early studies on the benefits or damages caused by birds in fields were made by analysis of stomach contents and observation of feeding behaviour. Modern studies aimed to manage birds in agriculture make use {{of a wide range of}} principles from ecology. Intensive aquaculture has brought humans in conflict with fish-eating birds such as cormorants.|$|E
25|$|Forest species, {{such as the}} slaty-breasted tinamou, {{maintain}} large home ranges {{through which}} they move in apparently random patterns. The male brushland tinamou maintains a home territory of , but will occasionally wander outside it into those of his neighbors. Females will wander throughout multiple males' territories. The ornate tinamou lives mainly upslope in hilly puna grassland but will move each morning {{to the bottom of}} the slopes to feed and drink. <b>Granivorous</b> species will move daily into grain fields with some, such as Darwin's nothura, remaining in the fields until there is no food left. Open country and southern species maintain territories only during the breeding season and at other times seem to wander at random.|$|E
25|$|Seed {{predation}} often {{occurs at}} contrasting plant ontogenic stages. Predispersal seed predation takes place when seeds {{are removed from}} the parent plant before dispersal, {{and it has been}} most often reported in invertebrates, birds, and in <b>granivorous</b> rodents that clip fruits directly from trees and herbaceous plants. Postdispersal seed predation arises once seeds have been released from the parent plant. Birds, rodents, and ants are known to be among the most pervasive postdispersal seed predators. Furthermore, postdispersal seed predation can take place at two contrasting stages: predation on the ‘‘seed rain’’ and predation on the ‘‘seed bank’’. Whereas predation on the seed rain occurs when animals prey on released seeds usually flush with the ground surface, predation on the seed bank takes place after seeds have been incorporated deeply into the soil. Both pre- and post-dispersal seed predation are extremely frequent in nature. However, fundamental differences occur between the two. Pre-dispersal predators are most often specialists, as {{they are more likely to}} adapt to clustered resources. Predator specialization requires that these animals utilize specific cues like plant chemistry (volatile compounds), color and size to attack seeds. In addition, specialization requires that the life cycle of the predator match the production of seeds by the host plant. Therefore, animals with shorter life span, like insects, are more common pre-dispersal predators. Common insect groups of pre-dispersal predators are Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera. For this reason, a greater diversity of predators feed on seeds prior to dispersal. Nevertheless, there are important vertebrate pre-dispersal predators, especially birds and small mammals.|$|E

500|$|The {{grouping}} of species gave Bewick difficulty, as the scientific {{sources of the}} time did not agree on how to arrange the species in families, or on a sequence or {{grouping of}} those families. Bewick for example uses family groups like [...] "Of the Falcon", in which he includes buzzards and sparrowhawks {{as well as what}} are now called falcons. The families of land birds are further grouped into birds of prey, omnivorous birds, insectivorous birds, and <b>granivorous</b> birds, while the families of water birds are simply listed, with what seemed to be related families, such as [...] "Of the Anas" [...] (ducks) and [...] "Of the Mergus" [...] (sawbill ducks), side by side.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} {{effectively}} the first [...] "field guide" [...] for non-specialists. Bewick provides an accurate illustration of each species, from life if possible, or from skins. The common and scientific name(s) are listed, citing the naming authorities. The bird is described, with its distribution and behaviour, often with extensive quotations from printed sources or correspondents. Those who provided skins or information are acknowledged. The species are grouped into families such as [...] "Of the Falcon", using the limited and conflicting scientific {{sources of the}} time. The families of land birds are further grouped into birds of prey, omnivorous birds, insectivorous birds, and <b>granivorous</b> birds, while the families of water birds are simply listed, with related families side by side.|$|E
500|$|Birds may be {{classified}} by terms {{related to the}} types of foods they forage for and eat. The -vore suffix {{is derived from the}} Latin vorare, meaning [...] "to devour". Equivalent adjectives can be formed through use of the suffix -vorous. For example, granivore (n.) / <b>granivorous</b> (adj.). Generally, classification terms are used based on predominance of food source and/or specialization. There can be much cross-over and mixing between classifications. For example, insectivores and piscivores may at times be described more broadly as types of carnivores, and hummingbirds, though they do eat insects, are often described as nectarivores, rather than insectivores, as nectar is a specialized and predominant food foraging source for that bird family. The feeding strategies of birds is intimately tied to their physiology and evolutionary development. For example, [...] shape and structure such as the makeup of the , the presence (or not) of a , and myriad other adaptations are tied to a species' feeding strategies. Feeding habits also correlate with aspects of brain development and size. For example, the spatial memory of birds that store food in various locations {{has been shown to be}} highly developed and contributes towards success at that feeding tactic.|$|E
500|$|Singular: tomium. The {{cutting edges}} of the [...] and [...] mandibles. In most birds, these range from rounded to {{slightly}} sharp, but some species have evolved structural modifications {{that allow them to}} handle their typical food sources better. <b>Granivorous</b> (seed-eating) birds, for example, have ridges in their tomia, which help the bird to slice through a seed's outer hull. Birds in roughly 30 families have tomia lined with tight bunches of very short bristles along their entire length. Most of these species are either [...] (preferring hard-shelled prey) or snail eaters, and the brush-like projections may help to increase the coefficient of friction between the mandibles, thereby improving the bird's ability to hold hard prey items. Serrations on hummingbird bills, found in 23% of all hummingbird genera, may perform a similar function, allowing the birds to effectively hold insect prey. They may also allow shorter-billed hummingbirds to function as nectar thieves, as they can more effectively hold and cut through long or waxy flower corollas. In some cases, the colour of a bird's tomia can help to distinguish between similar species. The snow goose, for example, has a reddish-pink bill with black tomia, while the whole beak of the similar Ross's goose is pinkish-red, without darker tomia.|$|E
2500|$|The tomia (singular tomium) are {{the cutting}} {{edges of the}} two mandibles. In most birds, these range from rounded to {{slightly}} sharp, but some species have evolved structural modifications {{that allow them to}} handle their typical food sources better. <b>Granivorous</b> (seed-eating) birds, for example, have ridges in their tomia, which help the bird to slice through a seed's outer hull. Most falcons have a sharp projection along the upper mandible, with a corresponding notch on the lower mandible. They use this [...] "tooth" [...] to sever their prey's vertebrae fatally or to rip insects apart. Some kites, principally those that prey on insects or lizards, also have {{one or more of these}} sharp projections, as do the shrikes. Some fish-eating species, e.g., the mergansers, have sawtooth serrations along their tomia, which help them to keep hold of their slippery, wriggling prey.|$|E
2500|$|Both phylogenetic and {{character}} {{data are available}} for the radiation of finches inhabiting the Galapagos Islands. These data allow testing of hypotheses concerning the timing and ordering of character state changes through time via ancestral state reconstruction. During the dry season, the diets of the 13 species of Galapagos finches may be assorted into three broad diet categories, first those that consume grain-like foods are considered [...] "granivores", those that ingest arthropods are termed [...] "insectivores" [...] and those that consume vegetation are classified as [...] "folivores". Dietary ancestral state reconstruction using maximum parsimony recover 2 major shifts from an insectivorous state: one to granivory, and one to folivory. Maximum-likelihood ancestral state reconstruction recovers broadly similar results, with one significant difference: the common ancestor of the tree finch (Camarhynchus) and ground finch (Geospiza) clades are most likely <b>granivorous</b> rather than insectivorous (as judged by parsimony). In this case, this difference between ancestral states returned by maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood likely {{occurs as a result}} of the fact that ML estimates consider branch lengths of the phylogenetic tree.|$|E

5000|$|In Hawai‘i, where B. decapetala has {{the local}} name pōpoki, it forms impenetrable brambles, climbs high up trees, closes off {{pastures}} to animals and impedes forest pathways.

50|$|Paspalums {{are also}} food for {{caterpillars}} of lepidopterans {{such as the}} pasture day moth (Apina callisto), {{and those of the}} dark palm dart (Telicota ancilla) which feed on P. urvillei. <b>Granivorous</b> birds often eat paspalum seeds; the chestnut-breasted munia (Lonchura castaneothorax) readily feeds on the seeds of P. longifolium, for example.|$|E
50|$|The montane African {{climbing}} mouse avoids predation {{by being}} nocturnal, using its well-adapted hind feet to climb twigs and dense grasses and its long hindlimbs to produce long jumps {{of up to}} 45 cm. Its climbing agility is used to contribute to its insectivorous and <b>granivorous</b> diet, and allows for nests to be above ground.|$|E
50|$|Ord's {{kangaroo}} rats {{are primarily}} <b>granivorous</b> and herbivorous.
