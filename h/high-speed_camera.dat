5|$|Myles' Mary Collins {{prosthetic}} {{took six}} hours to accomplish, and the shot where she morphs into the younger Lady Helen took seven hours to complete because it required three stages of make-up. Her first {{performance at the}} beheading scene was met with applause by the extras; Head requested that he redo {{his part of the}} scene because he felt that it was not good enough. Gaius' fall from the balcony was done by a stuntman and filmed with a <b>high-speed</b> <b>camera.</b> The mattress that Merlin magically moves across the floor was achieved with rigging it up to hidden wires and pulleys under the set. The knives Arthur throws were actually shot out of a nitrogen gun; James did throw them in a separate shot, but against a cloth that he still missed. Fake fruit was made for the stocks scene, but it was deemed too fake-looking and was replaced with real tomatoes. The mace fight was originally filmed with plastic maces, but they were not believable as they did not have enough weight. The scene was then shot with real steel maces; {{it was one of the}} most complex and hardest scenes to execute. The climax, where the guests all fall asleep and are covered by cobwebs, took many days to complete. The chandelier falling was also considered difficult.|$|E

25|$|The Enterprise-D crash {{sequence}} {{was filmed}} in a 40-by-80ft forest floor set extended by matte paintings, built outside so ILM could use natural light. A 12-foot model Enterprise saucer was constructed {{specifically for the}} shots; the model's size gave it the right sense of scale for flying dirt and debris, an illusion enhanced by shooting with a <b>high-speed</b> <b>camera</b> to give the saucer the expected slow movement of a massive object. ILM shot its crew members walking about their parking lot and matted the footage onto {{the top of the}} saucer to represent the Starfleet personnel evacuating the saucer section.|$|E
500|$|For this mission, Ashworth was the weaponeer, with Lieutenant Philip M. Barnes, USN, of the 1st Ordnance Squadron as his {{assistant}} weaponeer on the B-29 Bockscar. Project Alberta's Walter Goodman and Lawrence H. Johnston were {{on board the}} instrumentation aircraft, The Great Artiste, along with William L. Laurence, a correspondent for The New York Times. Leonard Cheshire and William Penney were on the observation plane Big Stink. Project Alberta's Robert Serber {{was supposed to be}} on board but was left behind by the aircraft commander, Group Operations Officer Major James I. Hopkins, Jr., [...] because he had forgotten his parachute. Since Serber was the only crew member who knew how to operate the <b>high-speed</b> <b>camera,</b> {{the whole point of the}} aircraft's mission, Hopkins had to be instructed by radio from Tinian on its use.|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} which Jessica and Jo save Kator from {{drowning}} in the river {{was among the first}} to be shot and presented difficulties for the crew. The Ash had been used as a waste dump for many years, causing the water to stagnate; according to Warren it looked [...] "more like crude oil". In addition, Annen was unable to swim. To keep Stokes, Annen and Faulkner in the water for as little time as possible, Warren reduced the amount of footage that needed to be shot by having the scene filmed in slow-motion on a <b>high-speed</b> <b>camera.</b> Once out of the water, the actors were given precautionary tetanus injections. Marcel was highly impressed with the footage and insisted that Alan Jones, the film's editor, leave the scene uncut despite Warren's concerns that it was too long. The production ended with the filming of Anderson and Sandy's deaths; this scene was shot night-for-night as the last day's filming had run into the early hours of the next morning.|$|E

500|$|A then-record 3,000-plus {{special effects}} shots would {{ultimately}} {{be required for}} the film. The shoot utilized on-set, in-camera special effects more often than computer-generated effects {{in an effort to}} save money and get more authentic pyrotechnic results. Many of these shots were accomplished at Hughes Aircraft in Culver City, California, where the film's art department, motion control photography teams, pyrotechnics team, and model shop were headquartered. The production's model-making department built {{more than twice as many}} miniatures for the production than had ever been built for any film before by creating miniatures for buildings, city streets, aircraft, landmarks, and monuments. The crew also built miniatures for several of the spaceships featured in the film, including a 30-foot (9.1 m) destroyer model and a version of the mother ship spanning [...] City streets were recreated, then tilted upright beneath a <b>high-speed</b> <b>camera</b> mounted on a scaffolding filming downwards. An explosion would be ignited below the model, and flames would rise towards the camera, engulfing the tilted model and creating the rolling [...] "wall of destruction" [...] look seen in the film. A model of the White House was also created, covering [...] by , and was used in forced-perspective shots before being destroyed in a similar fashion for its destruction scene. The detonation took a week to plan and required 40 explosive charges.|$|E

2500|$|Working {{with visual}} effects {{supervisor}} Dan Glass, Trumbull {{used a variety}} of materials for the creation of the universe sequence. [...] "We worked with chemicals, paint, fluorescent dyes, smoke, liquids, CO2, flares, spin dishes, fluid dynamics, lighting and high speed photography to see how effective they might be," [...] said Trumbull. [...] "It was a free-wheeling opportunity to explore, something that I have found extraordinarily hard to get in the movie business. Terry didn't have any preconceived ideas of what something should look like. We did things like pour milk through a funnel into a narrow trough and shoot it with a <b>high-speed</b> <b>camera</b> and folded lens, lighting it carefully and using a frame rate that would give the right kind of flow characteristics to look cosmic, galactic, huge and epic." [...] The team also included Double Negative in London. Fluid-based effects were developed by Peter and Chris Parks, who had previously worked on similar effects for The Fountain.|$|E
5000|$|Analyzing {{and documenting}} a {{nondestructive}} failure mode {{can also be}} accomplished using a <b>high-speed</b> <b>camera</b> recording continuously (movie-loop) until the failure is detected. Detecting the failure can be accomplished using a sound detector or stress gauge which produces a signal to trigger the <b>high-speed</b> <b>camera.</b> These high-speed cameras have advanced recording modes to capture some non-destructive failures. [...] After the failure the <b>high-speed</b> <b>camera</b> will stop recording. The capture images can be played back in slow motion showing precisely what happen before, {{during and after the}} nondestructive event, image by image.|$|E
