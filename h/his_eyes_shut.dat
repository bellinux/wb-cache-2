500|$|After being knifed in {{the back}} by John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) in the third season finale, Naomi uses her {{satellite}} phone to call George Minkowski (Fisher Stevens) on the freighter. [...] Before she dies, she tells him that her injury was an accident and to give her love to her sister. [...] Meanwhile, Hurley finds Jacob's cabin. [...] He looks {{through the window and}} sees an unidentified man in a rocking chair, before someone steps up to the glass, only the left eye visible. [...] Hurley runs away, but finds the cabin again—in a different location. [...] He squeezes <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut</b> and when he opens them, the building is gone and Locke appears.|$|E
500|$|In {{the right}} panel, Dyer is shown with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut,</b> {{vomiting}} into a hand basin. In the two outer frames his figure is shadowed by arrows, pictorial devices that Bacon {{often used to}} place a sense of energy into his paintings. In this work, the arrows point to a man about to die, and according to Tóibín they scream [...] "Here!", [...] "Him!". The arrow of the right panel, according to Tóibín, points to a [...] "dead figure on the lavatory bowl, as though telling the Furies where to find him". The triptych is centralised by the lightbulb, and {{by the fact that}} Dyer faces inwards in the two outer canvasses. The triptych's composition and setting are poised to suggest instability, and the doors in each side panel are splayed outwards as if to look into the darkness of the foreground.|$|E
2500|$|There were naysayers, and the commonest {{criticism}} {{was that the}} production distracted the viewer from the play by prioritizing Brook's cleverness over Shakespeare's; one reviewer called it a [...] "self-indulgent display of directorial gimmickry". Theatre historian John Russell Brown felt that the play was constrained by Brook's eccentric personal interpretations. However, even those critics who disliked the staging choices praised the verse-speaking for its clarity and freshness. One Shakespearean scholar supposedly watched it with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut,</b> loving the acting, but hating the visuals.|$|E
6000|$|Sam kept <b>'is</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut</b> and 'eard 'em whispering; then he felt 'em take 'is hand up {{and look}} at it. [...] "Where did you get it, Sam?" [...] ses Peter.|$|R
60|$|I left 'em {{standing}} side by side, {{looking at}} the skipper as if 'e was a waxworks, while I went to find a cab. When I came back they {{was in the same}} persition, and 'e was smoking with <b>'is</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut.</b>|$|R
60|$|He patted 'im on the {{shoulder}} agin, and Sam, arter fidgeting about a bit, went out. The last time he ever see Peter's uncle he was laying {{on the bed with}} <b>'is</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut,</b> smiling in <b>his</b> sleep. And Peter Russet didn't see Sam for eighteen months.|$|R
2500|$|While {{the three}} gods {{are at the}} falls, Ótr (in {{the form of an}} otter) catches a salmon and eats it on a river bank, <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut,</b> when Loki hits and kills him with a stone. The gods think that this is great, and flay the skin from the otter to make a bag. That night, the three gods stay with Hreidmar (the father of Regin, Andvari, and the now-dead Ótr) and show him their catches, {{including}} the skin of the otter. Upon seeing the skin, Regin and Hreidmar [...] "seized them and made them ransom their lives" [...] in exchange for filling the otterskin bag the gods had made with gold and covering the exterior of the bag with red gold.|$|E

50|$|On October 20, 2010, Anhalt {{was taken}} to a {{hospital}} after swallowing a bee, which then stung him in the throat. On December 22, 2010, he was again admitted to a hospital after gluing <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>shut</b> with nail glue. On September 2, 2011, he was hospitalized after being hit by a car in Beverly Hills.|$|R
60|$|The car shot up, rushing furiously. Taylor's head spun; he hung on, <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut.</b> Up and up....|$|E
60|$|Brother John's head dropped {{upon his}} chest, and <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut</b> {{as though he}} had gone to sleep.|$|E
60|$|The sheik {{was lying}} with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut.</b> As Edgar {{approached}} he opened them, and the lad {{saw he was}} recognized.|$|E
60|$|Bill {{got most}} of it in the {{shoulder}} and a little in the cheek, but the row he see fit to make you'd ha' thought he'd been killed. He laid on the ground groaning with <b>'is</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut,</b> and everybody thought 'e was dying till Henery Walker stooped down and asked 'im whether 'e was hurt.|$|R

6000|$|While little Jack shovelled {{in the hot}} oysters, with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shutting</b> up now {{and then}} in spite of himself, we {{looked at him and}} thought again of little Rosy-face at home safe in his warm nest, with mother-love {{watching}} over him. Nodding towards the ragged, grimy, forlorn, little creature, dropping asleep over his supper like a tired baby, I said,-- ...|$|R

6000|$|... "We need {{have no fear}} of them," [...] William Dawkins said. [...] "Their {{lieutenant}} is paid handsomely {{for keeping}} <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut,</b> and asking no questions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{the devil}} {{are you talking}} about?" [...] demanded Bill coldly. He had been {{suspicious}} all along of Archie's statement that he could listen better with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut.</b>|$|E
60|$|The tree still spun on, and Joe closed <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> to <b>shut</b> out {{the sight}} {{of what was to}} follow.|$|R
6000|$|... "What are you grumbling about, anyway?" [...] Hazard Van Dorn {{lifted a}} soap-rimmed face questioningly. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> were <b>shut.</b> [...] "What's our luck?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> dropped <b>shut</b> and {{the lower}} jaw {{threatened}} to drop, but he mastered the qualms of dissolution long enough to omit one final, loud, derisive cackle.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, sir--it's funny," [...] Ransome {{was evidently}} puzzled. [...] "He hasn't spoken a word, and <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> are <b>shut.</b> But {{it looks to}} me more like sound sleep than {{anything}} else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{all very}} well," [...] said Kantwise, {{looking up to}} the ceiling with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> nearly <b>shut.</b> [...] "But you'll see. What'll you bet me, Mr. Moulder, that Joseph Mason don't get the property?" ...|$|R
60|$|Davy screwed <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> tight <b>shut</b> {{and seemed}} to meditate on this for a time. Then he crawled up and put his arms about Anne's neck, snuggling his flushed little face down on her shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nephew--to--Lord--Decimus,' Mr Meagles luxuriously {{repeated}} with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>shut,</b> that {{he might}} have nothing to distract him from the full flavour of the genealogical tree. 'By George, you are right, Gowan. So he is.' ...|$|E
