25|$|On May 7, Francisco Salgado Valladares, {{the deputy}} police chief of Iguala, {{was arrested by}} the Federal Police in Cuernavaca, Morelos. He was wanted for his alleged {{involvement}} in intercepting the students {{on their way to}} Iguala. According to law enforcement reports, Salgado Valladares had connections with the Guerreros Unidos gang and reportedly received bribes from them to <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> other members of the police corporation. At the time of his arrest, {{he was one of the}} most-wanted suspects in the case.|$|E
25|$|Both FIFA and UEFA have awards {{which they}} <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> {{individuals}} or groups {{of people who have}} promoted {{what they see as the}} spirit of Fair Play, both within and outside of football. An example of this was the Italian player Paolo Di Canio who, while not given an award, was congratulated by many sections of the football world for a generous display of Fair Play. Despite having a goal scoring opportunity while playing for West Ham United against Everton, when Di Canio saw the Everton goalkeeper had picked up an injury, instead of scoring what could have been the easiest goal of his career, he caught the ball, thus stopping play and allowing the goalkeeper to receive treatment.|$|E
25|$|The Knight Bus is {{a heavily}} enchanted purple triple-decker Regent Three class bus that {{transports}} witches and wizards. It is hailed {{just like in}} hitchhiking, but instead of the thumb, the wizard has to hold his wand <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> hail the Knight Bus. It makes its first appearance in Prisoner of Azkaban when Harry unintentionally hails it by holding his wand hand out. Harry has a final ride on the Knight Bus {{with a number of}} his friends in Order of the Phoenix. The Knight Bus is faster than travelling by broomstick, but not as fast as near instantaneous Floo Powder and Apparating. The bus charges for the service based on distance; Harry is charged a base fare of 11 Sickles to travel from Little Whinging to The Leaky Cauldron. Amenities such as hot-water bottles, toothbrushes, and hot chocolate are available for a small additional fee.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the opening}} match, AAA paid {{homage to the}} promotion's founder, Antonio Peña, while the ring crew set up a steel cage for the second match of the evening, a four-way Parejas Suicidas match, {{featuring}} the teams of Chessman and Juventud Guerrera, Extreme Tiger and Halloween, Jack Evans and Teddy Hart, and Joe Líder and Psicosis. The match was contested under escape rules, with all eight participants starting inside the cage and after only one is left inside, that person will then wrestle his partner in a Lucha de Apuestas. Psicosis allowed Halloween to {{climb to the top}} of the cage, believing that he was going to dive back in onto his opponents, but instead Halloween betrayed his Perros del Mal stablemate and became the first man to escape the cage. Extreme Tiger and Jack Evans, former AAA World Tag Team Champions, worked together against Psicosis and Teddy Hart, the other two Perros del Mal members in the match, but were then attacked by Juventud Guerrera, swinging a garbage can. Guerrera then became the second man to escape the cage and was followed shortly afterwards by Tiger, who dove from the top of the cage outside onto Halloween and Guerrera. This meant that the former La Familia de Tijuana was the first team to successfully avoid the Lucha de Apuesta. This was followed by Psicosis turning on and attacking Líder, who had publicly announced prior to the event that he hoped to lose the Parejas Suicidas match to get a shot at Psicosis' hair, before escaping the cage. Evans was the next to escape the cage, after avoiding Teddy Hart's attempts to stop him. Hart then climbed on top of the cage and dove onto Chessman and Líder with a moonsault, before climbing back up and escaping, saving himself and Evans from a Hair vs. Hair match and leaving only Chessman and Líder inside. Psicosis, realizing he was in danger of being forced to a Hair vs. Hair match, climbed up the cage and put his <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Líder, offering to help him up. Líder grabbed the hand and started to climb, but was dropped to the mat following a kick from Chessman, who then climbed {{to the top of the}} opposite side of the cage to become the last escapee, meaning that the former La Hermandad 187 partners were forced to a Lucha de Apustas later in the event. As Chessman celebrated at the top of the cage, the lights in the arena suddenly went out, leading to Vampiro making a surprise appearance and pushing his rival down from the top of the cage, dropping him through a set of tables on the floor of the Arena Ciudad de México. Afterwards, Chessman was stretchered out of the arena, while Vampiro showed his support for Líder in his upcoming match.|$|E

2500|$|Flower Power {{originated}} in Berkeley, California, {{as a symbolic}} action of protest against the Vietnam War. In a November 1965 essay titled How to Make a March/Spectacle, Ginsberg advocated that protesters should be provided with [...] "masses of flowers" [...] to <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> policemen, press, politicians and spectators. The use of props like flowers, toys, flags, candy and music were meant to turn anti-war rallies into a form of street theater thereby reducing the fear, anger and threat that is inherent within protests. [...] In particular, Ginsberg wanted to counter the [...] "specter" [...] of the Hells Angels motorcycle gang who supported the war, equated war protesters with communists and had threatened to violently disrupt planned anti-war demonstrations at the University of California, Berkeley. Using Ginsberg's methods, the protest received positive attention {{and the use of}} [...] "flower power" [...] became an integral symbol in the counterculture movement.|$|E

This was succeeded by a 152-crayon set in a plastic yellow carrying case in 2013, with all the colors from the 150-crayon set plus the standard colors Piggy Pink and Blue Bell.|$|E
2500|$|When Sammartino {{was about}} 51 years old, he was {{involved}} in a backstage fight with a former football player. Six men were backstage at a wrestling show in an area that was restricted, and when Sammartino spotted the men, he told them that if security saw them in this area, they might get in trouble. Dave [...] "Rooster" [...] Fleming, a former CFL player with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, stuck his <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Sammartino. When Sammartino went to shake his hand, Fleming began to squeeze hard, and Sammartino asked him what he was doing, to which Fleming replied, [...] "You're nothing but a washed up old man". Sammartino responded, [...] "Not too washed up to take care of you". Upon hearing that, Fleming took a swing at Sammartino, but Sammartino blocked it and knocked him down with a punch. Sammartino soon found himself fighting the other five men at once. At this time, The Iron Sheik was in the showers after his match and heard the commotion. He immediately jumped in next to Sammartino and the two wrestlers proceeded to [...] "clean house".|$|E

2500|$|The film then rolls {{into the}} song “A World Without” as a grief-stricken Charlie {{and several other}} mourners, {{some of whom are}} clearly played by Queensrÿche's band members, attend Cathy’s funeral. The priest begins his eulogy but then appears to be {{laughing}} and pointing at Charlie, as do everyone else in attendance except for La Torre, who looks at Charlie with a serious face, as Charlie clutches his child wrapped in a blanket. Brian is also shown to be laughing and pointing but his appearance {{as well as the other}} mourners’ cruelty is revealed to be happening merely inside Charlie’s head, coinciding with the lyric [...] "what is real and what is fantasy". The song continues playing as Charlie is seen sitting beside a crib and drinking heavily while a baby is heard crying. He has a vision of Cathy picking up their child from the crib, and recalls the look on Brian’s face that day when he finked on him. Charlie then proceeds to pull a gun from a drawer and point it at his head but the vision of Cathy returns to assure him that she is there with him. Four years later, Charlie is seen working at his desk and smiling at a picture that his daughter drew for him. As he leaves his desk, the camera zooms in on a photograph of his now four-year-old daughter. Charlie heads toward the garage where he finds his brother waiting for him by the car. Without saying a word, Brian nervously holds his <b>hand</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> Charlie who happily embraces him, and the two of them reconcile. During the end credits, the track [...] "X2" [...] is played.|$|E
