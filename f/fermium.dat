5|$|Because of {{the short}} {{half-life}} of all isotopes of <b>fermium,</b> any primordial <b>fermium,</b> that is <b>fermium</b> that could be present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now. Synthesis of <b>fermium</b> from naturally occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the Earth crust requires multiple neutron capture, which is an extremely unlikely event. Therefore, most <b>fermium</b> is produced on Earth in scientific laboratories, high-power nuclear reactors, or in nuclear weapons tests, and is present only {{within a few months}} {{from the time of the}} synthesis. The transuranic elements from americium to <b>fermium</b> did occur naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of <b>fermium</b> {{has only been}} studied in solution using tracer techniques, and no solid compounds have been prepared. Under normal conditions, <b>fermium</b> exists in solution as the Fm3+ ion, which has a hydration number of 16.9 and an acid dissociation constant of 1.6 (pKa= 3.8). Fm3+ forms complexes {{with a wide variety}} of organic ligands with hard donor atoms such as oxygen, and these complexes are usually more stable than those of the preceding actinides. It also forms anionic complexes with ligands such as chloride or nitrate and, again, these complexes appear to be more stable than those formed by einsteinium or californium. It is believed that the bonding in the complexes of the later actinides is mostly ionic in character: the Fm3+ ion is expected to be smaller than the preceding An3+ ions because of the higher effective nuclear charge of <b>fermium,</b> and hence <b>fermium</b> would be expected to form shorter and stronger metal–ligand bonds.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fermium</b> is a {{synthetic}} element with symbol Fm and atomic number 100. It {{is a member}} of the actinide series. It is the heaviest element that can be formed by neutron bombardment of lighter elements, and hence the last element that can be prepared in macroscopic quantities, although pure <b>fermium</b> metal has not yet been prepared. A total of 19 isotopes are known, with 257Fm being the longest-lived with a half-life of 100.5 days.|$|E
5|$|The {{transuranic}} elements from americium to <b>fermium,</b> including berkelium, occurred naturally {{in the natural}} nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.|$|E
5|$|Although no new {{elements}} (apart from einsteinium and <b>fermium)</b> {{could be}} {{detected in the}} nuclear test debris, and the total yields of transuranium elements were disappointingly low, these tests did provide significantly higher amounts of rare heavy isotopes than previously available in laboratories.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the most}} stable isotope of <b>fermium</b> is 257Fm, with a {{half-life}} of 100.5days, most studies are conducted on 255Fm (t1/2= 20.07(7)hours), since this isotope can be easily isolated as required as the decay product of 255Es (t1/2= 39.8(12)days).|$|E
5|$|Before mendelevium's discovery, Seaborg and Katz {{predicted}} {{that it should}} be predominantly trivalent in aqueous solution and hence should behave similarly to other tripositive lanthanides and actinides. After the synthesis of mendelevium in 1955, these predictions were confirmed, first in the observation at its discovery that it eluted just after <b>fermium</b> in the trivalent actinide elution sequence from a cation-exchange column of resin, and later the 1967 observation that mendelevium could form insoluble hydroxides and fluorides that coprecipitated with trivalent lanthanide salts. Cation-exchange and solvent extraction studies led to the conclusion that mendelevium was a trivalent actinide with an ionic radius somewhat smaller than that of the previous actinide, <b>fermium.</b> Mendelevium can form coordination complexes with 1,2-cyclohexanedinitrilotetraacetic acid (DCTA).|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium is a synthetic, silvery-white, {{radioactive}} metal. In {{the periodic}} table, {{it is located}} {{to the right of}} the actinide californium, to the left of the actinide <b>fermium</b> and below the lanthanide holmium with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Its density of 8.84 g/cm3 is lower than that of californium (15.1 g/cm3) and is nearly the same as that of holmium (8.79 g/cm3), despite atomic einsteinium being much heavier than holmium. The melting point of einsteinium (860°C) is also relatively low – below californium (900°C), <b>fermium</b> (1527°C) and holmium (1461°C). Einsteinium is a soft metal, with the bulk modulus of only 15 GPa, which value is one of the lowest among non-alkali metals.|$|E
5|$|The neutron-capture {{product of}} fermium-257, 258Fm, {{undergoes}} spontaneous fission with a half-life of just 370(14)microseconds; 259Fm and 260Fm are also unstable {{with respect to}} spontaneous fission (t1/2= 1.5(3)s and 4ms respectively). This means that neutron capture cannot {{be used to create}} nuclides with a mass number greater than 257, unless carried out in a nuclear explosion. As 257Fm is an α-emitter, decaying to 253Cf, and no known <b>fermium</b> isotopes undergo beta minus decay (which would produce isotopes of the next element, mendelevium), <b>fermium</b> is also the last element that can be prepared by a neutron-capture process.|$|E
5|$|This {{discovery}} was further substantiated by their detailed {{measurements of the}} alpha decay chain of the produced bohrium atoms to previously known isotopes of <b>fermium</b> and californium. The IUPAC/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG) recognised the GSI collaboration as official discoverers in their 1992 report.|$|E
5|$|Although {{few people}} {{come in contact with}} <b>fermium,</b> the International Commission on Radiological Protection has set annual {{exposure}} limits for the two most stable isotopes. For fermium-253, the ingestion limit was set at 107 becquerels (1 Bq is equivalent to one decay per second), and the inhalation limit at 105 Bq; for fermium-257, at 105 Bq and 4000 Bq respectively.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table, mendelevium is located {{to the right}} of the actinide <b>fermium,</b> to the left of the actinide nobelium, and below the lanthanide thulium. Mendelevium metal has not yet been prepared in bulk quantities, and bulk preparation is currently impossible. Nevertheless, a number of predictions and some preliminary experimental results have been done regarding its properties.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} in September 1954. No alpha decay was seen from mendelevium atoms; thus, Ghiorso suggested that the mendelevium had all decayed by electron capture to <b>fermium</b> and that the experiment should be repeated to search instead for spontaneous fission events. The repetition of the experiment happened in February 1955.|$|E
5|$|Nineteen {{isotopes}} of <b>fermium</b> {{are known}} with mass numbers of 242–260. 254Fm, 255Fm and 256Fm are α-emitters {{with a short}} half-life (hours), which can be isolated in significant amounts. 257Fm (t1/2 = 100 days) can accumulate upon prolonged and strong irradiation. All these isotopes are characterized by high rates of spontaneous fission.|$|E
5|$|The high {{radioactivity}} of einsteinium has {{a potential}} use in radiation therapy, and organometallic complexes have been synthesized {{in order to}} deliver einsteinium atoms to an appropriate organ in the body. Experiments have been performed on injecting einsteinium citrate (as well as <b>fermium</b> compounds) to dogs. Einsteinium(III) was also incorporated into beta-diketone chelate complexes, since analogous complexes with lanthanides previously showed strongest UV-excited luminescence among metallorganic compounds. When preparing einsteinium complexes, the Es3+ ions were 1000 times diluted with Gd3+ ions. This allowed reducing the radiation damage so that the compounds did not disintegrate {{during the period of}} 20 minutes required for the measurements. The resulting luminescence from Es3+ was much too weak to be detected. This was explained by the unfavorable relative energies of the individual constituents of the compound that hindered efficient energy transfer from the chelate matrix to Es3+ ions. Similar conclusion was drawn for other actinides americium, berkelium and <b>fermium.</b>|$|E
5|$|These {{results were}} {{published}} in several articles in 1954 with the disclaimer that these were not the first studies that had been carried out on the elements. The Berkeley team also reported some results on the chemical properties of einsteinium and <b>fermium.</b> The Ivy Mike results were declassified and published in 1955.|$|E
5|$|After production, the <b>fermium</b> must be {{separated}} from other actinides and from lanthanide fission products. This is usually achieved by ion-exchange chromatography, with the standard process using a cation exchanger such as Dowex50 or TEVA eluted with a solution of ammonium α-hydroxyisobutyrate. Smaller cations form more stable complexes with the α-hydroxyisobutyrate anion, and so are preferentially eluted from the column. A rapid fractional crystallization method has also been described.|$|E
5|$|It was {{discovered}} in the debris of the first hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952, and named after Enrico Fermi, {{one of the pioneers}} of nuclear physics. Its chemistry is typical for the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 oxidation state but also an accessible +2 oxidation state. Owing to the small amounts of produced <b>fermium</b> and all of its isotopes having relatively short half-lives, there are currently no uses for it outside basic scientific research.|$|E
5|$|There are 19 {{isotopes}} of <b>fermium</b> {{listed in}} NUBASE2003, with atomic weights of 242 to 260, of which 257Fm is the longest-lived with a half-life of 100.5days. 253Fm has a half-life of 3 days, while 251Fm of 5.3h, 252Fm of 25.4h, 254Fm of 3.2h, 255Fm of 20.1h, and 256Fm of 2.6hours. All the remaining ones have half-lives ranging from 30 minutes {{to less than}} a millisecond.|$|E
5|$|Americium is {{produced}} mostly artificially in small quantities, for research purposes. A tonne of {{spent nuclear fuel}} contains about 100grams of various americium isotopes, mostly 241Am and 243Am. Their prolonged radioactivity is undesirable for the disposal, and therefore americium, together with other long-lived actinides, must be neutralized. The associated procedure may involve several steps, where americium is first separated and then converted by neutron bombardment in special reactors to short-lived nuclides. This procedure is well known as nuclear transmutation, {{but it is still}} being developed for americium. The transuranic elements from americium to <b>fermium</b> occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possible}} way {{to separate the}} trivalent actinides is via solvent extraction chromatography using bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase and nitric acid as the mobile aqueous phase. The actinide elution sequence is reversed {{from that of the}} cation-exchange resin column, so that the heavier actinides elute later. The mendelevium separated by this method has the advantage of being free of organic complexing agent compared to the resin column; the disadvantage is that mendelevium then elutes very late in the elution sequence, after <b>fermium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Valence 3 is {{dominant}} in all subsequent elements up to lawrencium (with {{the possible exception}} of nobelium). Curium can be tetravalent in solids (fluoride, dioxide). Berkelium, along with a valence of +3, also shows the valence of +4, more stable than that of curium; the valence 4 is observed in solid fluoride and dioxide. The stability of Bk4+ in aqueous solution is close to that of Ce4+. Only valence 3 was observed for californium, einsteinium and <b>fermium.</b> The divalent state is proven for mendelevium and nobelium, and in nobelium it is more stable than the trivalent state. Lawrencium shows valence 3 both in solutions and solids.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the short}} {{half-life}} of all isotopes of einsteinium, any primordial einsteinium, that is einsteinium that could possibly be present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now. Synthesis of einsteinium from naturally occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the Earth crust requires multiple neutron capture, which is an extremely unlikely event. Therefore, all terrestrial einsteinium is produced in scientific laboratories, high-power nuclear reactors, or in nuclear weapons tests, and is present only {{within a few years}} {{from the time of the}} synthesis. The transuranic elements from americium to <b>fermium,</b> including einsteinium, occurred naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so. Einsteinium was observed in Przybylski's Star in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{lanthanides}} and actinides, in {{the metallic}} state, can exist as either divalent (such as europium and ytterbium) or trivalent (most other lanthanides) metals. The former have fn+1s2 configurations, whereas the latter have fnd1s2 configurations. In 1975, Johansson and Rosengren examined the measured and predicted {{values for the}} cohesive energies (enthalpies of crystallization) of the metallic lanthanides and actinides, both as divalent and trivalent metals. The conclusion was that the increased binding energy of the 5f136d17s2 configuration over the 5f147s2 configuration for nobelium {{was not enough to}} compensate for the energy needed to promote one 5f electron to 6d, as is true also for the very late actinides: thus einsteinium, <b>fermium,</b> mendelevium, and nobelium were expected to be divalent metals, although for nobelium this prediction has not yet been confirmed. The increasing predominance of the divalent state well before the actinide series concludes is attributed to the relativistic stabilization of the 5f electrons, which increases with increasing atomic number: an effect of this is that nobelium is predominantly divalent instead of trivalent, unlike all the other lanthanides and actinides. In 1986, nobelium metal was estimated to have an enthalpy of sublimation between 126kJ·mol−1, a value close to the values for einsteinium, <b>fermium,</b> and mendelevium and supporting the theory that nobelium would form a divalent metal. Like the other divalent late actinides (except the once again trivalent lawrencium), metallic nobelium should assume a face-centered cubic crystal structure. Divalent nobelium metal should have a metallic radius of around 197pm. Nobelium's melting point has been predicted to be 827°C, the same value as that estimated for the neighboring element mendelevium. Its density is predicted to be around 9.9±0.4g·cm−3.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Fermi {{served under}} J. Robert Oppenheimer on the General Advisory Committee, which advised the Atomic Energy Commission on nuclear matters and policy. Following the {{detonation}} {{of the first}} Soviet fission bomb in August 1949, he strongly opposed {{the development of a}} hydrogen bomb on both moral and technical grounds. He was among the scientists who testified on Oppenheimer's behalf at the 1954 hearing that resulted in the denial of the latter's security clearance. Fermi did important work in particle physics, especially related to pions and muons, and he speculated that cosmic rays arose through material being accelerated by magnetic fields in interstellar space. Many awards, concepts, and institutions are named after Fermi, including the Enrico Fermi Award, the Enrico Fermi Institute, the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station, and the synthetic element <b>fermium,</b> making him one of 16 scientists who have elements named after them.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method to}} isolate {{mendelevium}} exploits the distinct elution properties of Md2+ {{from those of}} Es3+ and Fm3+. The initial steps {{are the same as}} above, and employs HDEHP for extraction chromatography, but coprecipitates the mendelevium with terbium fluoride instead of lanthanum fluoride. Then, 50mg of chromium is added to the mendelevium to reduce it to the +2 state in 0.1Mhydrochloric acid with zinc or mercury. The solvent extraction then proceeds, and while the trivalent and tetravalent lanthanides and actinides remain on the column, mendelevium(II) does not and stays in the hydrochloric acid. It is then reoxidized to the +3 state using hydrogen peroxide and then isolated by selective elution with 2Mhydrochloric acid (to remove impurities, including chromium) and finally 6Mhydrochloric acid (to remove the mendelevium). It is also possible to use a column of cationite and zinc amalgam, using 1Mhydrochloric acid as an eluant, reducing Md(III) to Md(II) where it behaves like the alkaline earth metals. Thermochromatographic chemical isolation could be achieved using the volatile mendelevium hexafluoroacetylacetonate: the analogous <b>fermium</b> compound is also known and is also volatile.|$|E
5|$|Seaborg was the {{principal}} or co-discoverer of ten elements: plutonium, americium, curium, berkelium, californium, einsteinium, <b>fermium,</b> mendelevium, nobelium and element 106, which, {{while he was still}} living, was named seaborgium in his honor. He also discovered more than 100 atomic isotopes and is credited with important contributions to the chemistry of plutonium, originally as part of the Manhattan Project where he developed the extraction process used to isolate the plutonium fuel for the second atomic bomb. Early in his career, he was a pioneer in nuclear medicine and discovered isotopes of elements with important applications in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, most notably iodine-131, which is used in the treatment of thyroid disease. In addition to his theoretical work {{in the development of the}} actinide concept, which placed the actinide series beneath the lanthanide series on the periodic table, he postulated the existence of super-heavy elements in the transactinide and superactinide series.|$|E
5|$|The first {{announcement}} {{of the discovery of}} element 102 was announced by physicists at the Nobel Institute in Sweden in 1957. The team reported that they had bombarded a curium target with carbon-13 ions for twenty-five hours in half-hour intervals. Between bombardments, ion-exchange chemistry was performed on the target. Twelve out of the fifty bombardments contained samples emitting (8.5±0.1)MeV alpha particles, which were in drops which eluted earlier than <b>fermium</b> (atomic number Z=100) and californium (Z=98). The half-life reported was 10minutes and was assigned to either 251102 or 253102, although the possibility that the alpha particles observed were from a presumably short-lived mendelevium (Z=101) isotope created from the electron capture of element 102 was not excluded. The team proposed the name nobelium (No) for the new element, which was immediately approved by IUPAC, a decision which the Dubna group characterized in 1968 as being hasty. The following year, scientists at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory repeated the experiment but were unable to find any 8.5MeV events which were not background effects.|$|E
5|$|The longest-lived isotope of curium, 247Cm, has a {{half-life}} of 15.6 million years. Therefore, any primordial curium, that is curium {{present on}} the Earth during its formation, should have decayed by now, although some of it would be detectable as an extinct radionuclide as an excess of its nearly stable daughter 235U. Curium is produced artificially, in small quantities for research purposes. Furthermore, it occurs in spent nuclear fuel. Curium is present in nature in certain areas used for the atmospheric nuclear weapons tests, which were conducted between 1945 and 1980. So {{the analysis of the}} debris at the testing site of the first U.S. hydrogen bomb, Ivy Mike, (1 November 1952, Enewetak Atoll), beside einsteinium, <b>fermium,</b> plutonium and americium also revealed isotopes of berkelium, californium and curium, in particular 245Cm, 246Cm and smaller quantities of 247Cm, 248Cm and 249Cm. For reasons of military secrecy, this result was published only in 1956.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} compare nobelium's chemical behavior to that of terbium, californium, and <b>fermium.</b> All four elements were reacted with chlorine and the resulting chlorides were deposited along a tube, along which they were carried by a gas. It {{was found that the}} nobelium chloride produced was strongly adsorbed on solid surfaces, proving that it was not very volatile, like the chlorides of the other three investigated elements. However, both NoCl2 and NoCl3 were expected to exhibit nonvolatile behavior and hence this experiment was inconclusive as to what the preferred oxidation state of nobelium was. Determination of nobelium's favoring of the +2 state had to wait until the next year, when cation-exchange chromatography and coprecipitation {{experiments were}} carried out on around fifty thousand 255No atoms, finding that it behaved differently from the other actinides and more like the divalent alkaline earth metals. This proved that in aqueous solution, nobelium is most stable in the divalent state when strong oxidizers are absent. Later experimentation in 1974 showed that nobelium eluted with the alkaline earth metals, between Ca2+ and Sr2+. Nobelium is the only f-block element for which the +2 state is the most common and stable one in aqueous solution. This occurs because of the large energy gap between the 5f and 6d orbitals {{at the end of the}} actinide series.|$|E
5|$|Mendelevium was {{the ninth}} {{transuranic}} element to be synthesized. It was first synthesized by Albert Ghiorso, Glenn T. Seaborg, Gregory Robert Choppin, Bernard G. Harvey, and team leader Stanley G. Thompson in early 1955 at the University of California, Berkeley. The team produced 256Md (half-life of 77 minutes) when they bombarded an 253Es target consisting {{of only a}} billion (109) einsteinium atoms with alpha particles (helium nuclei) in the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory's 60-inch cyclotron, thus increasing the target's atomic number by two. 256Md thus became the first isotope of any element to be synthesized one atom at a time. In total, seventeen mendelevium atoms were produced. This discovery {{was part of a}} program, begun in 1952, that irradiated plutonium with neutrons to transmute it into heavier actinides. This method was necessary as the previous method used to synthesize transuranic elements, neutron capture, could not work {{because of a lack of}} known beta decaying isotopes of <b>fermium</b> that would produce isotopes of the next element, mendelevium, and also due to the very short half-life to spontaneous fission of 258Fm that thus constituted a hard limit to the success of the neutron capture process.|$|E
5|$|The {{analysis}} of the debris at the 10-megaton Ivy Mike nuclear test {{was a part of}} long-term project, {{one of the goals of}} which was studying the efficiency of production of transuranium elements in high-power nuclear explosions. The motivation for these experiments was as follows: synthesis of such elements from uranium requires multiple neutron capture. The probability of such events increases with the neutron flux, and nuclear explosions are the most powerful neutron sources, providing densities of the order 1023 neutrons/cm2 within a microsecond, i.e. about 1029 neutrons/(cm2·s). In comparison, the flux of the HFIR reactor is 5 neutrons/(cm2·s). A dedicated laboratory was set up right at Enewetak Atoll for preliminary {{analysis of}} debris, as some isotopes could have decayed by the time the debris samples reached the U.S. The laboratory was receiving samples for analysis, as soon as possible, from airplanes equipped with paper filters which flew over the atoll after the tests. Whereas it was hoped to discover new chemical elements heavier than <b>fermium,</b> those were not found after a series of megaton explosions conducted between 1954 and 1956 at the atoll.|$|E
5|$|The {{lanthanides}} and actinides, in {{the metallic}} state, can exist as either divalent (such as europium and ytterbium) or trivalent (most other lanthanides) metals. The former have fnd1s2 configurations, whereas the latter have fn+1s2 configurations. In 1975, Johansson and Rosengren examined the measured and predicted {{values for the}} cohesive energies (enthalpies of crystallization) of the metallic lanthanides and actinides, both as divalent and trivalent metals. The conclusion was that the increased binding energy of the 5f126d17s2 configuration over the 5f137s2 configuration for mendelevium {{was not enough to}} compensate for the energy needed to promote one 5f electron to 6d, as is true also for the very late actinides: thus einsteinium, <b>fermium,</b> mendelevium, and nobelium were expected to be divalent metals. The increasing predominance of the divalent state well before the actinide series concludes is attributed to the relativistic stabilization of the 5f electrons, which increases with increasing atomic number. Thermochromatographic studies with trace quantities of mendelevium by Zvara and Hübener from 1976 to 1982 confirmed this prediction. In 1990, Haire and Gibson estimated mendelevium metal to have an enthalpy of sublimation between 134 and 142kJ·mol−1. Divalent mendelevium metal should have a metallic radius of around (194±10)pm. Like the other divalent late actinides (except the once again trivalent lawrencium), metallic mendelevium should assume a face-centered cubic crystal structure. Mendelevium's melting point has been estimated at 827°C, the same value as that predicted for the neighboring element nobelium. Its density is predicted to be around 10.3±0.7g·cm−3.|$|E
25|$|For the {{elements}} up to 92 (uranium), naming elements after people was discouraged. The two exceptions are indirect, {{the elements}} being named after minerals that were themselves named after people. These were gadolinium (found in gadolinite, {{named after the}} Finnish chemist Johan Gadolin) and samarium (the mineral samarskite was named after a Russian mining engineer, Vasili Samarsky-Bykhovets). Among the transuranium elements, this restriction was relaxed, there followed curium (after the Curies), einsteinium, <b>fermium</b> (Enrico Fermi), mendelevium (Dmitri Mendeleev), nobelium, and lawrencium (after Ernest Lawrence).|$|E
500|$|<b>Fermium</b> is {{produced}} by the bombardment of lighter actinides with neutrons in a nuclear reactor. Fermium-257 is the heaviest isotope that is obtained via neutron capture, and can only be produced in picogram quantities. The major source is the 85MW High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, USA, which {{is dedicated to the}} production of transcurium (Z> 96) elements. Lower mass <b>fermium</b> isotopes are available in greater quantities, however, these isotopes (254 and 255) are very short lived. In a [...] "typical processing campaign" [...] at Oak Ridge, tens of grams of curium are irradiated to produce decigram quantities of californium, milligram quantities of berkelium and einsteinium and picogram quantities of <b>fermium.</b> However, nanogram quantities of <b>fermium</b> can be prepared for specific experiments. The quantities of <b>fermium</b> produced in 20–200kiloton thermonuclear explosions is believed to be of the order of milligrams, although it is mixed in with a huge quantity of debris; 4.0picograms of 257Fm was recovered from 10kilograms of debris from the [...] "Hutch" [...] test (16July 1969). The Hutch experiment produced an estimated total of 250 micrograms of 257Fm.|$|E
500|$|Einsteinium and <b>fermium</b> were {{identified}} in 1952–1953 in {{the fallout from the}} [...] "Ivy Mike" [...] nuclear test (1 November 1952), the first successful test of a hydrogen bomb. Instantaneous exposure of uranium-238 to a large neutron flux resulting from the explosion produced heavy isotopes of uranium, including uranium-253 and uranium-255, and their β-decay yielded einsteinium-253 and fermium-255. The discovery of the new elements and the new data on neutron capture were initially kept secret on the orders of the U.S.military until 1955 due to Cold War tensions. Nevertheless, the Berkeley team were able to prepare einsteinium and <b>fermium</b> by civilian means, through the neutron bombardment of plutonium-239, and published this work in 1954 with the disclaimer that it was not the first studies that had been carried out on the elements. The [...] "Ivy Mike" [...] studies were declassified and published in 1955. The first significant (submicrograms) amounts of einsteinium were produced in 1961 by Cunningham and colleagues, but this has not been done for <b>fermium</b> yet.|$|E
