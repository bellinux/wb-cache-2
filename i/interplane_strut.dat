25|$|The Dongó's wings {{were simply}} braced {{compared}} with most biplanes of the day, with an arrangement {{made possible by}} the narrow chord and large stagger. A single, vertical, faired <b>interplane</b> <b>strut</b> on each side braced the rear spar of the upper wing to the lower forward spar. Towards its top a metal faired-in oblique strut braced the forward, upper spar and there was a similar arrangement at its foot to the rear spar. To minimise drag, there were no conventional cross bracing flying wires but instead a single, faired diagonal strut from the top of each interplane struts to the corresponding lower fuselage longeron.|$|E
2500|$|Any {{aircraft}} fuelled {{to fly the}} Atlantic {{was going}} to be heavy and undercarriage design was critical, as Martinsyde found to their cost. [...] The Atlantic used a split axle arrangement: on each side the short main leg extended from below the forward and innermost <b>interplane</b> <b>strut.</b> [...] There was a second member back to below the aft <b>interplane</b> <b>strut</b> and an axle from the large single wheel upwards and inwards, hinged to the lower fuselage longeron. [...] Shocks were absorbed by a combination of oleo-pneumatic and bungee elastic components. [...] At 21ft 0 in (6.40 m) the track was very wide.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{examples}} built had {{upper and}} lower wings of equal span, {{although most of the}} aircraft eventually produced had an extended upper wing and were known as the Military Version. [...] The examples of this type sold to the Russian government and the first aircraft sold to the British Army were fitted with a third rudder hinged to the centre leading-edge <b>interplane</b> <b>strut</b> of the tailplane, but this was not made standard.|$|E
50|$|The Special was a four-bay biplane, with square-tipped, constant-chord, unequal-span wings {{connected}} by pairs of parallel <b>interplane</b> <b>struts.</b> The 4 ft (1.2 m) overhangs {{of the upper}} wings were braced with an extra pair of <b>interplane</b> <b>struts,</b> leaning outwards and attached to the lower wing at the same points as the outer vertical <b>interplane</b> <b>struts.</b> There were externally interconnected ailerons on both upper and lower wings. The lower wings were attached to the bottom fuselage and the upper ones supported well above {{the top of the}} fuselage.|$|R

2500|$|The {{empennage}} of the Type D {{was supported}} {{on a pair}} of girders arranged parallel to one another in plan. The upper girder members were attached to the upper wing spars at the tops of the innermost interplane struts and the lower ones ran under the lower wing, mounted on downward extensions of the inner interplane struts. The mounting was strengthened with two diagonal struts on each side, one {{from the base of the}} forward <b>interplane</b> <b>strut</b> to the upcurved tip of the lower member and the other from the rear <b>interplane</b> <b>strut</b> to the junction of the lower member and its first vertical cross member. [...] Each of these lower members, which supported the aircraft on the ground as skids, carried twin, rubber sprung landing wheels. Behind the wing the upper and lower members converged to the rear; the drag on the lower members reduced the landing run. There were three vertical cross braces on each girder but the only lateral inter-girder cross-members were near the tail, though there was wire bracing. The broad chord tailplane was mounted a little below the upper girder member with a pair of round-cornered rectangular rudders above it.|$|E
2500|$|The first Riesenflugzeug built was the VGO.I {{flying in}} April 1915, using three engines; two pusher and one tractor, with a [...] span, four-bay <b>interplane</b> <b>strut</b> layout for its {{slightly}} swept-back leading edge biplane configuration, maintained {{throughout the entire}} Zeppelin-Staaken R-series of aircraft during World War I. The VGO.I was built for the Marine-Fliegerabteilung (Imperial German naval Air service) and served on the Eastern Front Later modified with two extra engines, it crashed during tests at Staaken. A similar machine, the VGO.II was also used on the Eastern Front.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{a single}} bay biplane with a single <b>interplane</b> <b>strut</b> on each side {{defining}} a bay braced with a single flying wire and a single landing wire. Both wings [...] were two spar structures; there was marked forward stagger but no dihedral The interplane struts were slender at the top but smoothly widened towards their feet, linking the upper rear spar to both lower wing spars. The narrow upper joint provided a fixed point about which control wires could warp the trailing edge. Short cabane struts from the fuselage supported {{the centre of the}} upper wing.|$|E

2500|$|This Wolfgang Dallach design, {{like his}} Dallach Sunrise, was marketed by WD Flugzeug Leichtbau (WDFL), the kits {{at least partly}} built in the Czech Republic by UL-Jih Sedláĉek Spol s.r.o. The Sunwheel is {{constructed}} from metal tube and is fabric covered. [...] It is a single bay biplane with a single I-form, faired <b>interplane</b> <b>strut</b> on each side. [...] The wings are both swept and staggered. [...] There are ailerons on both upper and lower wings, externally interconnected. Cabane struts support the upper wing over the tandem, open cockpits. [...] The Sunwheel has a fixed tailwheel undercarriage, with the mainwheels hinged from the fuselage on V-form, cross-connected struts. [...] Some Sunwheels have wheel fairings.|$|E
2500|$|The SA-100 Starduster was {{designed}} by Louis A. Stolp and George M. Adams as a light sports aircraft for homebuilding from plans. [...] It is a single bay biplane with fabric covered, wooden framed staggered wings, each pair braced by a single, wide chord <b>interplane</b> <b>strut</b> aided by bracing wires. [...] A total of eight centre section struts join the upper wing to the fuselage, basically two pairs in N-form but with the forward strut doubled. The lower wing is unswept and has 1.5° of dihedral; the upper wing has 6° of sweep on its leading edge, no dihedral and a greater span. [...] There are ailerons on the lower wings only, but no flaps.|$|E
2500|$|Albatros {{responded with}} the D.Va, which {{featured}} stronger wing spars, heavier wing ribs and a reinforced fuselage. The modified D.Va was [...] {{heavier than the}} D.III but the structural problems were not entirely cured. Use of the high-compression 130kW (180hp) Mercedes D.IIIaü engine offset the increased weight of the D.Va. The D.Va also reverted to the D.III aileron cable linkage, running outwards through the lower wing, then upwards to the ailerons {{to provide a more}} positive control response. The wings of the D.III and D.Va were interchangeable. To further strengthen the wing, the D.Va added a small diagonal brace connecting the forward <b>interplane</b> <b>strut</b> to {{the leading edge of the}} lower wing; the brace was also retrofitted to some D.Vs.|$|E

5000|$|It was a three bay triplane, the bays {{separated}} by parallel pairs of <b>interplane</b> <b>struts.</b> The fabric covered wings were unswept and had constant chord and blunt tips. The spans decreased a little {{from top to}} bottom plane, so the outer <b>interplane</b> <b>struts</b> leaned outwards; there was little stagger. There were externally connected ailerons on each plane. The [...] Maybach Mb.IV six cylinder inline engines were mounted in the inner bay on the central plane, neatly and fully cowled.|$|R
2500|$|The Renegades's wings have a {{positive}} stagger and incorporate a single faired <b>interplane</b> <b>strut</b> and cabane struts as well as wire-bracing. The top wing has a span of [...] and incorporates a 10 degree sweep to improve visibility from the pilot's back seat, accessibility for the front seat passenger and reduces adverse yaw. The lower wing has 3 degrees of dihedral. Ailerons are of the Friese type, with two ailerons on the lower wing standard and four ailerons optional. The front wing spar was initially a [...] aluminum tube and the rear spar is [...] "C" [...] channel. Starting 1 January 1989 the front spar was changed to a rectangular spar and an outboard drag brace was added, increasing wing rigidity. The ribs are stamped aluminum and mate with an aluminium sheet leading edge. All surfaces are covered with aircraft fabric. Controls are via torque tubes.|$|E
2500|$|The Gurnard II {{returned}} from Martlesham to Rochester in 1931 for conversion into an amphibian. This involved the fitting of a single, central float which carried {{a pair of}} wheels using an axle that passed through its top. The wheels were on stubs offset from the axle, so that in one position they were lifted above the water, but rotated through 180° from the pilot's cockpit they reached the ground. A similar, smaller version had been used successfully on the Short Mussel and on a converted Moth. [...] The central float was again mounted {{with a pair of}} N-shaped struts, now vertical. There was a pair of outboard stabilising floats beyond the interplane struts, each mounted on a pair of vertical legs. The floats were each directly braced with a pair of struts to the interplane struts from below, and from above by a pair of struts {{from the top of the}} rear <b>interplane</b> <b>strut</b> to the tops of the legs. It first flew in this configuration in June 1931 and returned to Martlesham within the month, appearing in that year's Hendon RAF Display.|$|E
2500|$|The H.31 was {{a single}} bay biplane with {{straight}} edged, parallel chord wings with slight sweep and essentially no stagger; {{the leading edge of}} the lower wing was marginally behind that of the upper one because its chord was a little less. It also had a slightly smaller span. A single, wide chord, airfoil section <b>interplane</b> <b>strut</b> on each side, with widened roots to lower interference drag, separated the bays; on each side pairs of flying wires and landing wires provided cross bracing between these struts and the fuselage. The wings were built around twin Duralumin box main spars, with metal and wood ribs. [...] There were ailerons on the upper planes. [...] Neither wing was directly fuselage mounted but instead held off by pairs of N-form struts on each side. Those joining the lower wing to the low-mid fuselage were longer than those of the cabane and the lower forward component was itself a close pair. Both upper and lower wings had the common cut-outs to improve the pilot's vision but the H.31 had a forward, full chord slot between the upper wings as well.|$|E
2500|$|They {{were both}} biplanes, with round tipped {{constant}} chord wings connected by pairs of parallel <b>interplane</b> <b>struts.</b> The Type 137 was a standard two bay biplane but the 8ft (2.4 m) larger span Type 138 had an additional small inner bay. [...] There was some stagger, though {{less on the}} Type 138. [...] The upper wing had the greater span, overhanging by 6ft (1.8 m) on the Type 137 and by 4ft (1.2 m) on the Type 138. [...] This overhang was braced with an extra pair of <b>interplane</b> <b>struts,</b> leaning outwards and attached to the lower wing at the same points as the outer vertical <b>interplane</b> <b>struts.</b> There were externally interconnected ailerons on both upper and lower wings. [...] The lower wings were attached to the bottom fuselage and the upper ones supported well above the cockpits by cabane struts.|$|R

2500|$|The Vickers Type 253 used a Pegasus IIM3 engine, {{enclosed}} by a drag-reducing Townend ring, to power a two-bay, unstaggered biplane, {{with a lower}} wing smaller in span and chord. [...] Both wings were of constant chord, but the centre sections were mildly forward-swept and the lower centre section carried anhedral out to the inner <b>interplane</b> <b>struts.</b> Both sets of <b>interplane</b> <b>struts</b> leaned outwards, the outer ones more so. Both wings carried ailerons and the upper planes had leading edge slats. [...] The wings joined the fuselage top and bottom with no gap, the pilot sitting {{just ahead of the}} leading edge in an open cockpit and the observer sitting well behind the trailing edge. A conventional tail carried balanced rudder and elevators. The split-axle fixed undercarriage was neatly mounted, the main legs fixed to the front spar under the inner <b>interplane</b> <b>struts</b> and braced rearwards to the wing roots.|$|R
2500|$|Like Breguet's {{previous}} design, the Breguet Type I, {{the structure}} was principally of metal, although less highly stressed parts {{such as the}} tail surfaces used wood. [...] It had a triangular section fuselage of wire-braced steel tube with the [...] air-cooled Renault engine at the front: this drove a three-bladed propeller which {{was connected to the}} engine's camshaft and so revolved at half the speed of the engine. [...] The wings had pressed aluminium ribs threaded onto a mainspar of [...] diameter steel tube. [...] These were connected by a single <b>interplane</b> <b>strut</b> on either side. [...] Tail surfaces consisted of a pair of horizontal surfaces, the lower carried on the rear of the fuselage and the upper by a pair of [...] booms running back from the centre section of the upper wing. The upper surface was [...] movable to achieve pitch control. A rectangular balanced rudder was mounted between the two horizontal surfaces. [...] In addition a pair of small horizontal stabilising surfaces were mounted {{at the front of the}} aircraft either side of the engine. [...] The pilot's seat was positioned halfway between the wings and the tail surfaces: a passenger seat was fitted behind the engine. The main undercarriage employed oleo-pneumatic suspension, and there was a single steerable tailwheel.|$|E

50|$|The 65-1 had {{straight}} tapered, square tipped {{wings of}} equal span. Each was {{built around a}} single spar and skinned with aluminium. It was a single bay biplane with, on each side, a single, faired vertical <b>interplane</b> <b>strut</b> and a long bracing strut from the lower fuselage to the upper wing {{near the top of}} the <b>interplane</b> <b>strut.</b> The ailerons, fitted on piano hinges on both upper and lower wings, were made of aluminium and unbalanced. Flaps were carried on the upper wing only, filling 60% of its span. They had four positions, with a maximum deflection of 35°.|$|E
2500|$|Ernst Heinkel chief {{designer}} of the Hansa und Brandenburgische Flugzeug-Werke developed [...] the KD in 1916 {{to meet the requirements}} of the Austro-Hungarian Air Force (Kaiserliche und Königliche Luftfahrtruppen or K.u.K.

50|$|The LB 2 was {{designed}} as a shipboard fighter. It was a single bay sesquiplane, with outward leaning parallel pairs of <b>interplane</b> <b>struts</b> and wire cross bracing. The wings were strictly rectangular in plan, the lower plane smaller in both span and chord. The upper wing carried full span ailerons. Its flat sided fuselage was watertight and its belly deep; in emergency touchdowns at sea the undercarriage could be jettisoned with the aircraft stabilised with two small rectangular cross section, planing floats mounted on the lower wing underside below the <b>interplane</b> <b>struts.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Heinkel He 74 {{was a light}} fighter {{aircraft}} {{developed in}} Germany in the early 1930s. It was a conventional, single-bay biplane with staggered, unequal-span wings braced with an I-type <b>interplane</b> <b>strut.</b> The pilot sat in an open cockpit, and the undercarriage was of the fixed, tailskid type.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{features an}} <b>interplane</b> <b>strut,</b> cabane strut and cable-braced biplane layout, a three-seat open cockpit, with two passengers accommodated in side-by-side configuration {{in the front}} open cockpit and the pilot in the rear cockpit with a windshield. The aircraft has fixed conventional landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration.|$|E
50|$|The {{span of a}} wing {{between two}} sets of <b>interplane</b> or cabane <b>struts</b> is called a bay. Wings are {{described}} {{by the number of}} bays on each side.
