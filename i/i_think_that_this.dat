2500|$|The British Foreign Minister David Miliband said, [...] "I've just {{landed in}} New York and been {{told of the}} terrible, {{shocking}} news of 30 further civilian deaths in a UN school. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> devastating news underlines {{the need for the}} immediate ceasefire that the prime minister and I have been calling for." ...|$|E
2500|$|Foner's nephew Eric Foner, {{professor}} of history at Columbia University said that [...] "his uncle's radical politics are the crux of the recent debate. 'Obviously, any charge of plagiarism needs to be taken seriously,' he says. 'But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> controversy is being muddied up with powerful ideological issues that ought to be kept quite separate'." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Italian foreign {{minister}} Massimo D'Alema said [...] "We {{have the impression}} that the (Israeli) reaction is out of proportion and dangerous for the consequences it could have, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this,</b> apart from some nuances, is the way the whole international community sees the situation." [...] He then added, [...] "We are working for moves by the EU and the G8 in the next few hours to stop the spiral of violence," [...] making reference to the G8 meeting planned for the weekend in St. Petersburg. He also condemned Hezbollah's assault on Israeli soldiers as [...] "unacceptable," [...] adding that Rome had asked for the release of the soldiers being held hostage.|$|E
2500|$|That's all gonna be deconstructed and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that's</b> why <b>this</b> {{regulatory}} {{thing is}} so important." ...|$|R

2500|$|Translation of Abulafia's poems, as well {{as other}} medieval poems written in Hebrew, {{presents}} some challenges because some words could be interpreted with several meanings. A good example of such challenge is the poem [...] "Figs". Asking a friend for some figs, the poet writes: [...] "end a ripening fig, give a portion for seven of them, even for eight." [...] The next line of the poem was translated as [...] "And in return, here is my flatus." [...] The Hebrew word used in the poem was zemorah that means [...] "vine twig". Howard Tzvi Adelman from Queen's University says that [...] "Zemorah means 'penis' and 'fig,' a reference to 'vagina.' <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is a sexual and not a scatological reference; both, however, fit the category of the grotesque. The next line—'Henceforth I won't give it to strangers'—could fit either way." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 2010, Hopkins {{suggested}} that African American fighters who possessed {{what he described}} as a [...] "slick" [...] inner-city style of fighting would be successful against Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao. [...] "Maybe I'm biased because I'm black, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is what is said at people's homes and around the dinner table among black boxing fans and fighters. Most of them won't say it [...] because they're not being real and they don't have the balls to say it. But I do think that a fighter like the Ray Leonards or anyone like that would beat a guy [...] if they come with their game. Listen, this ain't a racial thing, but then again, maybe it is. But the style that is embedded in most of us black fighters, that style could be a problem to any other style of fighting." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first voices seeking {{compromise}} {{have started}} {{to be heard in}} Skopje. The president of the republic, Branko Crvenkovski, announced: [...] "If during the ongoing talks we can reach a rational compromise, which from the one side will defend our ethnic identity, and from the other will enable us to receive the NATO invitation, {{while at the same time}} canceling our further EU accession obstacles, then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is something that must be supported, and I personally side with the supporters. Some accuse me that with my stance I am undermining the negotiating position of the Republic of Macedonia, yet I do not agree, because we are not in the beginning, but in the final phase of the negotiations. The one who will tell me that the price is high, is obliged to address the public opinion and announce an alternative scenario on how Macedonia will develop in the next ten to fifteen years." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is his niece," [...] Louis answered. [...] "She {{has been}} brought up in France at a convent somewhere in the south, <b>I</b> believe. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> heard <b>that</b> <b>this</b> time she was to return to Brazil with her uncle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not that," [...] he said, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{you have}} {{scarcely}} done a wise thing in leaving your husband. <b>I</b> cannot <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{life on the}} stage is good for you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{are out in}} {{the ocean}} now," [...] remarked Dick an hour later. [...] "Gracious, when I left Cedarville <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was going to develop into such a long chase!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Aqil al-Turehi {{said that}} he [...] "feel furious when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> gang of Jim McCormick and the Iraqis working with him killed my people by {{creating}} false security and selling such a useless device". In one incident, a vehicle carrying rockets and missiles travelled undetected through 23 Baghdad checkpoints equipped with the ADE 651. The {{false sense of security}} provided by the device had catastrophic effects for many Iraqi people, hundreds of whom were killed in bombings that the ADE 651 failed to prevent. The victim of one such bombing, 21-year-old Haneen Alwan, told the BBC that her life had been destroyed after she was caught in a bomb attack which caused injuries that killed her unborn child and prompted her husband to divorce her because of her extensive burns, which have so far required her to undergo 59 operations. She said: [...] "When people passed through checkpoints using these devices, they thought they would be safe. But they are useless. The man who sold them has no conscience. He is morally bankrupt. How could he sell them just for money and destroy other people's lives?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Labour MK Binyamin Ben-Eliezer said in May 2013: [...] "whether Assad {{remains in}} power or not, {{is not in}} our hands. We keep hearing {{intelligence}} assessments that {{he is about to}} go down. In my opinion, the current situation is the best one for us. Do the math: the other option is more chaotic, given that those expected to fill the vacuum are al-Qaeda and the Salafist organizations. It is better to face a state, because not having a clear address is much worse for us. There are almost 400 gangs operating in Syria, so with whom do you talk and who do you hold accountable?" [...] Minister for International Affairs, Strategy and Intelligence Yuval Steinitz said on 10 June 2013 that [...] "I always thought that it might be the case {{that at the end of}} the day Assad, with a very strong Iranian and Hezbollah backing, might gain the upper hand. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is possible and I thought that this is possible already a long time ago. [...] might not just survive but even regain territories." [...] The statement was met with a cool reception by the foreign and defense ministries.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is {{just the}} place. I noticed that tall tree rising above the general line just {{opposite}} where we were anchored." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> cannot but <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is an {{anomalous}} and {{not wholly}} creditable state of things.|$|R
60|$|Quite so, my Lord, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> in <b>this</b> case your Lordship will be {{satisfied}} {{that there is}} no reason why probate should not issue. It is, humanly speaking, impossible that Mr. Meeson can have escaped the general destruction.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{think his}} name is Bunny," [...] said Beechnut. [...] "I knew Bunny. He was a {{squirrel}} that belonged to Rodolphus. He got away and ran off into the woods, but <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is the same one." ...|$|R
60|$|Should we {{ever see}} them again? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> was the unspoken {{question}} {{in the hearts of}} the many who were to go by land.|$|E
6000|$|... "Amos," [...] said De Catinat, [...] "I {{have spent}} my life among brave men, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is the bravest man that I have ever met!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fair cousin," [...] said Athelstane to Rowena, [...] "could <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> sudden {{disappearance}} of Ivanhoe was occasioned by {{other than the}} weightiest reason, I would myself resume--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sure I don't {{know what}} you mean, Mr. Ferris; but <b>I</b> can't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> proud look is {{habitual}} with Florida; and I've heard people say--very good judges--that an artist oughtn't to perpetuate a temporary expression. Something like that." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> all <b>this</b> courteous lying is a {{sweet and}} loving art, {{and should be}} cultivated. The highest {{perfection}} of politeness is only a beautiful edifice, built, from the base to the dome, of graceful and gilded forms of charitable and unselfish lying.|$|R
6000|$|And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> in <b>this</b> {{repudiation}} Father Suarez {{will have}} the sympathy of every man of common uprightness, to whom it is certainly [...] "incredible" [...] that the Almighty should have acted in a manner which He would esteem dishonest and base in a man.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{head and}} a crown will come close together," [...] and she kissed him and named him Rames after her royal forefather, the founder of their line.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> {{declaration}} {{to improve}} this orthography of ours is our family cancer, and I {{wish we could}} reconcile ourselves to have it cut out and let the family cancer go.|$|E

6000|$|... "Do <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> Major, <b>that</b> <b>this</b> useless lucre {{could be}} {{converted}} into coin of gracious King Edward? Not at all, Major, by no one, Major, by no one whatsoever, except possibly by Major Alan Vernon, D.S.O., and by one, Jeekie, Christian surname Smith." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not sure," [...] Mr. Deane replied, [...] "whether his {{position}} is logical. Capital {{must be the}} backbone of any great country, and the very elements of human nature demand its concentration. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> myself <b>that</b> <b>this</b> will all blow over." ...|$|R
60|$|In all, twenty-four volumes, {{which will}} begin {{printing}} after Quentin Durward, and concludes the year 1831. For half the property he proposes to pay 6000 guineas on 2d February 1831 [1832?]. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> with <b>this</b> sum, and others coming in, I {{may reduce the}} debt to £45,000.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is all, Captain Bayley; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this,</b> {{with what}} you have told me, is quite {{sufficient}} to bring the guilt home to the true party, and to completely clear Norris." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For a man working upon such slight data as {{he himself}} confesses," [...] was the quiet comment, [...] "he is damnably accurate. It is as well, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> did not reach Marshal Massena." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{looked hard}} at me: I {{was a new}} face, having just {{replaced}} the chief mate he was accustomed to see; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> novelty inspired him, as things generally did, with deep-seated mistrust.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I suppose I may {{venture that}} far, after having {{participated in the}} {{shooting}} of the Hoxie well. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> place is safe for you any longer, and if I {{was a member of}} this firm, I should move everything from here as soon as possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you know," [...] he said, [...] "I {{think he}} can see us better <b>this</b> way. <b>I</b> often <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> blank thing is his real face, watching, though it cannot be watched. He! he! Yes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he looks nice from behind. He looks more cruel from behind, don't you think?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite so, Father. Anything {{might happen}} either before or after; but still, with your leave, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> in <b>this</b> case we {{may as well}} certify first; {{you might want to}} be getting away, and it will save so much trouble later.
