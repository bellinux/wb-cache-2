The sensitivity for light and heavy Majorana neutrinos is investigated. The ratio with respect to the standard model charged current process is improved by some orders of magnitude if compared to previously discussed Majorana induced Δ L_μ = 2 processes. Non-observation of this process in previous experiments allows to demand the effective mass to be 10 ^ 4 GeV, being more stringent than previously discussed direct bounds, however still unnaturally high.

40|$|Audio search {{algorithms}} {{have reached}} a degree of speed and accuracy {{that allows them to}} search efficiently within large databases of audio. For speed, algorithms generally depend on precalculated indexing metadata. Unfortunately, the size of the metadata follows the same exponential trend as the audio data itself, and this may lead to an exponential increase in storage cost and search time. The concept of scalable metadata has been introduced to allow metadata to adjust to such trends and alleviate the effects of <b>forseeable</b> increases of data and metadata size. Here, we argue that scalability fits the needs of the hierarchical structures that allow fast search, and illustrate this by adapting a state-of-the-art search algorithm to a scalable indexing structure.

40|$|Proposals for {{approximating}} and harmonising {{indirect taxes}} across Europe {{are central to}} the planned creation of a single European market in 1992. If implemented, the Commission's proposals would have major direct and indirect effects {{for a wide variety of}} European business. They would also have very large effects on the revenue position, tax structures, and tax administrations of member states. For this reason, they are very unlikely to be implemented, and since partial harmonisation is no more possible than partial pregnancy, it follows that the realistic prospect of fiscal frontiers being dismantled in 1992, or in any <b>forseeable</b> time frame, is small. It is important that business planning should be based, not on loose generalisations about the coming single European market, but on a careful assessment of what changes are likely to be implemented in practice. ...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. Korean economic development within {{recent years has}} begun to attract the interest of Western economists with an enthusiasm similiar to that heretofore shown the Japanese management style. Two countries that have similiar characteristics such as overpopulation, poor resources, and Confucian tradition, might also have similiar management styles. However, the behavior pattern of Korean businessmen has several characteristics which differ from their Japanese counterparts. Interestingly, many of these differences result from a dissimiliar degree of Confucian influences. Accordingly, Korea has evolved its management system during a transition period influenced by traditional Confucianism, Japanese practices, and the American system. For the <b>forseeable</b> future, the Korean business environment will consist of a management style which is oriented comparatively more Japanese, than American.

40|$|Shared-memory {{symmetric}} multiprocessors (SMP's) {{based on}} conventional microprocessors {{are by far}} the most common parallel architecture today, {{and will continue to be}} so for the <b>forseeable</b> future. This thesis describes techniques to compile and schedule Id-S, a dialect of the implicitly parallel language Id, for execution on SMP's. We show that previous implementations of Id for conventional microprocessors incurred an overhead of at least 40 - 300 % over an efficient sequential implementation of Id-S. We break down this overhead into various presence-tag checking and scheduling overheads. Given this overhead, we conclude that a fine-grained, element-wise synchronizing implementation of Id is not suitable for use on small-scale SMP's. We then describe a parallelization technique for Id-S that discovers both DAG and loop parallelism. Our parallelization exploits Id-S's single-assignment semantics for data structures.
