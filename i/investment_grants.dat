30|$|When an <b>investment</b> <b>grant</b> is {{provided}} alone (Scenario 1), {{there is a}} small increase in capacity, while the impact on capacity of only providing operational grants is projected to be higher (Scenario 2 A and 2 B). With a one-time <b>investment</b> <b>grant</b> and without operational grants, the capacity increase is estimated to be about 6 %. The one-time <b>investment</b> <b>grant</b> does not create enough incentive in the model to expand capacity for child care centers, rather the operational grants seem to have a more convincing impact: when operational grants—with or without a price cap—are provided per child per month for 5  years, the impact on capacity is estimated to be 17 % with price cap and 24 % without the price cap (an estimated 2394 and 3306 new centers, respectively).|$|R

50|$|The leading {{industries}} in Haiti produce beverages, butter, cement, detergent, edible oils, flour, refined sugar, soap, and textiles.

30|$|Capacity {{increase}} is maximized in the scenario that combines the <b>investment</b> <b>grant</b> and the operational grant (and does not impose a price cap).

50|$|Since {{the federal}} {{government}} has stated the goal of promoting smart grid-technology, future legislation and incentives will address these barriers. The Department of Energy (DoE), Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are the primary government agencies developing smart grid policy. The DoE is working towards development of smart grids through <b>investment</b> <b>grants,</b> demonstration pilot programs, and research and development. In addition they are responsible for monitoring the progress of smart grid deployment and must submit a biannual report to Congress. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has the authority to regulate wholesale distribution of electricity. FERC is collaborating with the National Institute of Standards and Technology to develop the hundreds of standards necessary to regulate smart grid technology. The development of regulations and standards for the wide range of technology involved is essential to remove legal barriers and facilitate the development of technological solutions.|$|E

5000|$|From the IEA-PVPS report TRENDS 2014 in Photovoltaic Applications, p.23 — :Austria’s {{support for}} PV {{relies on a}} mix of capped FiT and <b>investment</b> <b>grants.</b> Due to a cap on the tariffs, the {{development}} ofPV in Austria remained quite low, with a market below 100 MW until 2011. With 176 MW in 2012 and 263 MW in 2013, the market progressed faster. Off-grid development amounted to 0,5 MW installed in 2013. Systems below 5 kW are incentivized through a financial incentive that can be increased for BIPV installations. Above 5 kW, the Green Electricity Act provides a FiT that was reduced in 2013. The FiT is guaranteed during 13 years and financed by a contribution of electricity consumers. Some financial grants can be added for specific buildings. In addition to federal incentives, most provinces are providing additional incentives through investment subsidies. Self-consumption is allowed for all systems. Self-consumption fees {{have to be paid}} if the self consumption is higher than 25 000 kWh/y. Rural electrification in remote areas not connected to the grid is incentivized through an investment subsidy up to 35% of the cost. right ...|$|E

The operational grant in the scenarios can be provided with a price cap option and without a price cap option (in Scenario 2 A and 2 B).

5000|$|Under the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG), sector-specific tariffs are set for {{electricity}} from renewable energies {{fed into the}} public supply grid. The amount of compensation follows the principle of cost-covering compensation {{and is based on}} the specific electricity production costs of the specific sectors. KfW's funding program Renewable Energy (Erneuerbare Energien) section Standard provides low-interest loans for investments in installations {{for electricity}} production in accordance with the EEG, cogeneration plants and for small heat production installations. In program section Premium low interest loans with repayment subsidies are granted for renewable energy heat produced in large installations. KfW funding programs for energy-efficient construction and renovation ( [...] building renovation program), which promote the development of renewable energies, are Energy efficient Construction (Energieeffizient Baue), Energy Efficient Renovation (Energieeffizient Sanieren) or Energy-efficient Renovation - Local Authorities (Energieeffizient Sanieren - Kommunen) and Social Investment - Building Refurbishment (Sozial Investieren- Energetische Gebäudesanierung).The Heat-and-power Cogeneration Act (KWKG) regulates the funding of old and new combined heat and power (CHP) plants and the development and construction of heating networks into which heat from CHP-plants is fed.Guidelines on the promotion of mini-CHP plants promote through <b>investment</b> <b>grants</b> the new construction of CHP - plants up to 50kWel.The Energy Tax Act (EnergieStG) provides tax relief for energy products used for combined heat and power production if the CHP plant has a monthly or annual efficiency of at least 70%.

40|$|Abstract: The usual {{assumption}} {{when considering}} <b>investment</b> <b>grants</b> is that grant payments are automatic when investments are undertaken. However, evidence from case studies {{shows that there}} can exist some time lag until funds are received by granted firms. In this paper the effects of delays in grant payments on the optimal investment policy of the firm are analyzed. It is shown how these delays lead not only to a higher financing cost but to an effective reduction in the investment grant rate, and in some cases, how benefits from <b>investment</b> <b>grants</b> could be canceled due to interactions with tax effects...|$|E

According to Schweickart, these grants {{do not represent}} [...] "free money", since an <b>investment</b> <b>grant</b> counts as an addition to the capital assets of the enterprise, upon which the capital-asset tax must be paid. Thus the capital assets tax functions as an interest rate. A bank grant is essentially a loan requiring interest payments but no repayment of principal.|$|R
