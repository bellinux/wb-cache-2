50|$|The <b>E-Mag</b> is an {{electronic}} Automag. Like other Automags, {{it has gone}} through different versions corresponding to advances to the Automag platform like the ReTro Valve, the Level 10 anti-chop system and the X-valve. Unlike most electronic markers, the <b>E-mag</b> is capable of firing in both electronic and mechanical modes through means of a readily available selector switch. The battery is rated for approximately 10 cases of paint (20,000 shots), This is {{in stark contrast to}} other electronic markers of the time(2000-2004) that must be recharged frequently or risk going {{down in the middle of}} a game, the trade off is that the <b>E-Mag</b> uses a much larger battery pack, whereas most markers operated off of a normal 9v battery. The <b>E-Mag</b> uses an unusual Hall effect sensor trigger instead of the more common microswitch, and the sensitivity of this magnetic trigger system gives the <b>E-Mag</b> a reputation for having hair trigger. Indeed, there have been many instances where the marker has fired from a slight jar instead of an intentional trigger pull. As a result, the safety is a very reliable actuator interrupt, and the marker is physically incapable of firing with it engaged.|$|E
5000|$|In February 1998, DemoNews, {{another major}} demoscene <b>e-mag,</b> stopped publication. This left a major void in the demoscene, and it {{put a damper}} on Coplan's plans as he had planned to bring his column to the DemoNews publication. Having nowhere to publish his column, he began to draw up ideas to form a new <b>e-mag</b> to fill the void left by the defunct TraxWeekly and DemoNews.|$|E
5000|$|Static Line came to {{fruition}} early in 1998. The invitation {{to join the}} mailing list was posted on the Hornet Archive in April 1998. [...] The official first issue of the <b>e-mag</b> was sent out via an e-mail mailing list in July 1998. The first 24 issues of Static Line were released using a majordomo mailing list through the Kosmic Free Music Foundation server. Starting at issue 25 in September 2000, the <b>e-mag</b> had grown in popularity and it had developed its own website which would later become known as SceneSpot. Its distribution and online archives were now managed by this new server.|$|E

Ides of March takes generally place at the end of March and the journey is continued since decade.|$|R
50|$|Airgun Designs briefly {{produced}} the <b>E-mag</b> and the X-Mag, manufactured by Airgun Designs Europe, {{to compete in}} tournaments {{that have come to}} be dominated by electro-pneumatic models. They have since discontinued their production. The E-Mag's design is unique in that it retains a mechanical link between the trigger and firing mechanism; the electronics work with manipulate electromagnets that lessen the pull strength. With a dead battery, the magnets are simply not functional and the gun reverts to mechanical operation similar to an RT. Therefore, the <b>E-mag</b> remained the only electro-pneumatic marker that would fire with a dead battery until the production of the Tippmann X-7 Phenom with its E-grip in 2009.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{economic}} problems, {{the magazine was}} no longer printed after its 13th issue. The magazine was instead changed into a periodical <b>E-mag</b> which is made available through the ktmROCKS website. Other activities of ktmROCKS, however, continue to remain full in action.|$|E
50|$|AGD {{was slow}} to {{integrate}} electronics into its markers, however, and by the late 1990s, the rise of electropneumatic paintball markers caused the company to lose market share and slowly slip in prominence. In order to remain competitive, AGD introduced the <b>E-mag</b> and later, the X-mag line. AGD now focuses on manufacturing mechanical markers and equipment for scenario and woodsball players.|$|E
5000|$|Reviewer Kurt Shoemaker of Texas, US, {{wrote in}} the SA Rock Digest <b>e-mag</b> on 27 November 1999: [...] "I cannot think of any {{performers}} or groups to compare the Radio Rats to, so I'm left with the conclusion that in rock this is original stuff. Additionally, while possessing a distinctive style, each song {{is different from the}} others [...] [...] [...] This is fun and original and rollicking rock that doesn't lend itself to analogy." ...|$|E
5000|$|Prior to the {{existence}} of Static Line, its creator, D. Travis North (aka: Coplan), wrote a music review column for an <b>e-mag</b> known as TraxWeekly. After TraxWeekly stopped publication in 1996, Coplan wrote a few articles which were published under different magazines or individually {{over the course of the}} next two years. Having already earned a reputation as a music reviewer, many demosceners were submitting songs for review, even though the magazine had long since dried up.|$|E

50|$|The ReTro Valve was a {{new version}} of the RT valve, {{designed}} to be compatible with older Automags. While initially sold as an upgrade, it soon became the standard for all new high-end Automags, and was used as the basis for the MicroMag, a collaborative project with PTP (Pro Team Products). It was also used as the initial valve for the <b>E-Mag.</b> This valve, unlike the classic valve, was made out of stainless steel with an aluminum back. It was capable of an estimated 26 BPS fire before shootdown.|$|E

5000|$|The [...] "Reactive Trigger" [...] of the RT and {{subsequent}} <b>E-Mag</b> and X-Mag designs {{proved to be}} detrimental to AGD; it was found that, given an HPA tank with sufficient output pressure, the reactive trigger could be set to push back after firing with greater strength than was required to pull it, allowing simulated full-auto operation by finding a [...] "sweet spot" [...] on the trigger, squeezing it with just enough force to fire it but less than the return strength. This {{was determined by the}} NPPL and other tournament leagues to confer an unfair advantage, and the rules were changed to specifically prohibit triggers set up to [...] "bounce" [...] (defined as registering more than one mechanical [...] "pull" [...] of the trigger per conscious application of pressure to the trigger by the player, whether by mechanical or electronic means).|$|E
5000|$|The X-Mag was {{basically}} the same marker as the <b>E-Mag</b> electronically, except it also included the ACE(Anti-Chop Eye). The components included the original introduction of the X-Valve, originally engraved with an XMag symbol, and now just an X. It wasn't always called the X-Mag. It originally was called the Emag Extreem which later became X-Mag for short. The body of the X-Mag was a single piece instead of the body-rail combo that all previous AGD mags used. The main feature of the X-Mag, besides the one-piece body, was the removable breeches, which allowed users to change the feed port from center feed to warpfeed left or warpfeed right. There were some rare colors produced just as in every previous run. Magma and Placenta {{were two of the}} colors that had runs of 3 or less. The original X-Mag was considered somewhat [...] "blocky-looking," [...] so AGD ran the body through a computer controlled CNC milling machine. The result was a lighter, more attractive marker named the C&C X-Mag.|$|E

30|$|A {{variety of}} {{instruments}} {{were used to}} characterize three batches of coal samples: the raw coal sample, the coal sample pretreated with HNO 3, and the depolymerized coal samples obtained under different pH conditions. The content of element C, H, O, N, and S in all three coal samples was determined by FLASHEA-PE 2400 elemental analyzer. The ash content in all three samples was estimated by analyzing the weight changes of the samples during the programmed temperature using Kaiyuan 5 <b>E-MAG</b> 6700 industrial analyzer. FT-IR and XRD characterizations of all three samples were performed by Bruker-EQUINOX 55 Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer and MAC-M 18 XHF 22 -SRA X-Ray Diffractometer, respectively. The thermal properties of the three samples were determined by PE-DTA/ 1700 thermal analyzer. The aqueous dispersions of depolymerized coal samples obtained under different pH conditions were diluted and dropped onto copper grid and dried to allow observation of the morphology and structure of all sample particles using Japan Hitachi H- 600 Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). The particle sizes of the aqueous dispersion were measured by using NANO- S 90 laser particle size analyzer.|$|E
40|$|Due to altered visual function, {{blind people}} are more exposed to risk factors of hypertension, a {{situation}} that proves the need to promote educational actions to prevent this disease. The objective was to develop affordable online course for the blind ones on prevention of hypertension. It was used Development Model of Digital Educational Material composed by five phases entitled Analysis and Planning; modeling; implementation; Evaluation and Maintenance; Distribution. In Analysis and Planning phase the product was characterized. The course about hypertension in online mode was directed to blind population. It was built in modeling a script and it was added a content to multimedia elements, being transformed into the pages for internet format with definition of navigation tools and design. There was obtained 15 pages that were divided into six educational modules. The study followed the accessibility standards of national documents (<b>e-MAG)</b> and international (WCAG). In the Deployment it was submit the accessibility evaluating course pages. Initially we used the software ASES that generated Error Reporting, accusing infringement of four national recommendations and three international principles. The pages were reviewed, and the inconsistencies were corrected. In the second test, the pages were lodged into SOLAR environment. It was contacted four blind people whom rated platform accessibility and usability of the platform by performing sequential activities of navigation. It {{was found that the}} SOLAR is partially accessible as it found some accessibility barriers (lack of field identification, disposal and inadequate identification fields and links; elements that prevented reading the content in a logical sequence and using the mouse). Therefore, the SOLAR needs improvement to facilitate navigation by the blind. The course components such as texts; images; audio and links were considered accessible, and the initial difficulty in navigation was, to be hosted, on the platform that needed improvements. The Evaluation and Maintenance occurred throughout the course preparation and the distribution will be addressed in further studies. The course did not suffer any changes and the prototype implemented in SOLAR was taken {{as the result of the}} research. It concludes that build online course as assistive technology for the blind is a viable task. This study provides information about prevention of hypertension and equal access to digital educational materials. The study encourages nurses to develop affordable technologies for health promotion of blind people. Devido alteraÃÃo da funÃÃo visual, cegos estÃo mais expostos aos fatores de risco da hipertensÃo, situaÃÃo que comprova a necessidade de promover aÃÃes educativas para prevenir esta patologia. Objetivou-se desenvolver curso online acessÃvel para cegos sobre prevenÃÃo da hipertensÃo. Utilizou-se Modelo de Desenvolvimento de Material Educativo Digital composto por cinco fases intituladas AnÃlise e Planejamento; Modelagem; ImplementaÃÃo; AvaliaÃÃo e ManutenÃÃo; DistribuiÃÃo. Na fase AnÃlise e Planejamento o produto foi caracterizado. Direcionou-se o curso aos cegos com tema sobre hipertensÃo na modalidade online. Na Modelagem construiu-se conteÃdo em roteiro e agregou-se elementos de multimÃdia, sendo transformado em pÃginas no formato para internet com definiÃÃo das ferramentas de navegaÃÃo e design. Obteve-se 15 pÃginas divididas em seis mÃdulos didÃticos. Seguiu-se os padrÃes de acessibilidade dos documentos nacionais (<b>e-MAG)</b> e internacionais (WCAG). Na ImplementaÃÃo submeteu-se as pÃginas do curso a avaliaÃÃo de acessibilidade. Inicialmente utilizou-se software ASES que gerou RelatÃrio de Erros, acusando infraÃÃo de quatro recomendaÃÃes nacionais e trÃs princÃpios internacionais. As pÃginas foram revisadas, sendo corrigidas as inconsistÃncias. No segundo teste, hospedou-se as pÃginas no ambiente SOLAR. Contactou-se quatro pessoas cegas que avaliaram acessibilidade e usabilidade da plataforma e curso mediante realizaÃÃo de atividades sequenciais de navegaÃÃo. Verificou-se que o SOLAR Ã parcialmente acessÃvel, pois foram encontradas algumas barreiras de acessibilidade (ausÃncia de identificaÃÃo de campos; disposiÃÃo e identificaÃÃo inadequada de campos e links; elementos que impediam leitura do conteÃdo em sequÃncia lÃgica e uso do mouse). Logo, o SOLAR necessita de melhorias para facilitar a navegaÃÃo por cegos. Os componentes do curso, tais como textos; imagens; Ãudio e links foram considerados acessÃveis, sendo que a dificuldade inicial na navegaÃÃo ocorreu por estar hospedado na plataforma que necessita de aprimoramentos. A AvaliaÃÃo e ManutenÃÃo ocorreu durante toda elaboraÃÃo do curso e a DistribuiÃÃo serÃ contemplada em estudo posterior. O curso nÃo sofreu modificaÃÃes e o protÃtipo implementado no SOLAR foi considerado resultado final da pesquisa. Conclui-se que construir curso online como tecnologia assistiva para cegos Ã tarefa viÃvel. Este oferece conhecimento sobre prevenÃÃo da hipertensÃo e igualdade de acesso a materiais educativos digitais. O estudo estimula enfermeiros a desenvolver tecnologias acessÃveis para promoÃÃo da saÃde das pessoas cegas...|$|E
