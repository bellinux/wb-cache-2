40|$|A large {{development}} of <b>downstream</b> <b>services</b> {{is expected to}} be stimulated starting from earth observations (EO) datasets acquired by Copernicus satellites. An important challenge connected with the availability of <b>downstream</b> <b>services</b> is the possibility for their integration in order to create innovative applications with added values for users of different categories level. At the moment, the world of geo-information (GI) is extremely heterogeneous in terms of standards and formats used, thus preventing a facilitated access and integration of <b>downstream</b> <b>services.</b> Indeed, different users and data providers have also different requirements in terms of communication protocols and technology advancement. In recent years, many important programs and initiatives have tried to address this issue even on trans-regional and international level (e. g. INSPIRE Directive, GEOSS, Eye on Earth and SEIS). However, a lack of interoperability between systems and services still exists. In order to facilitate the interaction between different <b>downstream</b> <b>services,</b> a new architectural approach (developed within the European project ENERGIC OD) is proposed in this paper. The brokering-oriented architecture introduces a new mediation layer (the Virtual Hub) which works as an intermediary to bridge the gaps linked to interoperability issues. This intermediation layer de-couples the server and the client allowing a facilitated access to multiple <b>downstream</b> <b>services</b> and also Open Data provided by national and local SDIs. In particular, in this paper an application is presented integrating four services on the topic of agriculture: (i) the service given by Space 4 Agri (providing services based on MODIS and Landsat data); (ii) Gicarus Lab (providing sample services based on Landsat datasets) and (iii) FRESHMON (providing sample services for water quality) and services from a several regional SDIs...|$|R

The embodied service component of exports is also strongly linked to the level of development. Production and Services; Services and Development; Trade in Services...|$|E

We obtain the strong approximation for the network, through an inductive application of an input-output analysis for a single station queue. Specically, we show that if the input data (i. e., the arrival and the service processes) satisfy an approximation (such as the functional law-of-iterated logarithm approximation or the strong approximation), then the output data (i. e., the departure processes) and the performance measures (such as the queue length, the workload and the sojourn time processes) satisfy a similar approximation.

40|$|The {{uncertainty}} {{associated with}} public transport services can be partially counteracted by developing real-time models to predict <b>downstream</b> <b>service</b> conditions. In this study, a hybrid approach for predicting bus trajectories by integrating multiple predictors is proposed. The prediction model combines schedule, instantaneous and historical data. The contribution of each predictor {{as well as}} values of respective parameters is estimated by minimizing the prediction error using a linear regression heuristic. The hybrid method was applied to five bus routes in Stockholm, Sweden, and Brisbane, Australia.

Model validation confirms model transferability and real-time applicability. Generating more accurate predictions can help service users adjust their travel plans and service providers to deploy proactive management and control strategies to mitigate the negative effects of service disturbances.

40|$|The {{research}} paper explores {{the extent to}} which mobile phones <b>downstream</b> <b>services,</b> defined here as those provided using the existing connectivity, are generating opportunities for entrepreneurship development in Kenya. After identifying the services of mobile payphones, money transfer and phone repair, the paper analyses the micro-enterprises providing them and their contribution to income and employment creation. It shows that majority of the enterprises providing the services are survivalists and they are characterised by minimal barriers to entry and therefore stiff competition. Those in growth-oriented category are characterised by barriers to entry and specialisation. These enterprises have made a notable contribution to the concerned households and the economy in form of employment opportunities, income generation and linkage with other sectors. They directly supported over 25, 000 households in addition to the extra staff employed in them. Across the board the incomes of the operators improved after engaging in the enterprises. The enterprises also created opportunities for women, youth, people with disabilities and those with low or no education. To the economy, payphones have contributed to increasing the mobile phones coverage to 75 % of the country; money transfer services have provided cheaper financial transactions and means of sending emergency funds; while repair services have enabled low income earners to remain connected even when they could not afford to buy new phones.

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{the last}} few years the mobile {{telecommunications}} industry has witnessed the entry {{of a large number of}} new service providers. Traditionally, mobile users get their mobile services from the service providers owned by vertically integrated mobile network operators (MNOs). The new entrants do not own a network of their own however, because they use the existing mobile infrastructure, i. e. they are ‘mobile virtual network operators ’ (MVNOs). By granting these virtual operators access to their networks, MNOs actually facilitate the entry of potential competitors for their own <b>downstream</b> <b>service</b> providers. These new entrants might attract additional users by offering competitive services and create extra value with their well-known brand names and other complementary assets. This study focuses on the mobile market of the Netherlands, where competition is intense and MVNOs proliferate. The aim of this research is to improve our understanding of the entry of virtual operators in general, and specifically by explaining why and how virtual operators enter the mobile market and the impact they have on competition in the mobile market...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. OWL-S allows selecting, {{composing}} and invoking Web Services descriptions, invocation uses {{low level}} grounding ones, while composition needs to consider both {{high and low}} level descriptions. In our setting, two Web Services are to be composed so that output from the upstream one is used to create input for the downstream one. These Web Services may have different data models but are {{related to each other}} through high and low level descriptions. Correspondences must be found between components of the upstream data type and the downstream ones. Low level data transformation functions may be required (e. g. unit conversions, data type conversions). The components may be arranged in different XML tree structures. Thus, multiple data transformations are necessary: reshaping the message tree, matching leaves by corresponding types, translating through ontologies, and calling conversion functions. Our prototype compiles these transformations into a set of data transformation rules, using our tableau-based ALC Description Logic reasoner to reason over the given OWL-S and WSDL descriptions, as well as the related ontologies. A resolution-based inference mechanism for running these rules is embedded in an inference queue that conducts data from the upstream to the <b>downstream</b> <b>service,</b> running the rules to perform the data transformation in the process. ...|$|E
40|$|Services {{dominate}} the economic {{landscape of the}} post-industrial OECD economies, typically accounting for between 60 and 70 percent of employment and a comparable share of GDP. Growth of the service sector is also recognised {{to be an important}} aspect of economic development and is strongly associated with income growth and economic modernisation. Explanations for the importance of services in modern economies, relative both to low-income countries and to historic patterns within OECD countries themselves, have emphasised demand-side factors. Yet, while emphasis in the services literature has been placed on final expenditure patterns and prices, some of the most striking aspects of service sector growth relate instead to the relationship of services to the production structure of economies, and particularly the relationship of the service sector to manufacturing.
