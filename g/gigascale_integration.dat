40|$|The {{driving force}} behind the {{spectacular}} advancement of the integrated circuit technology in the past thirty years has been the exponential scaling of the feature size, i. e., the minimum dimension of a transistor.

40|$|Digital {{systems have}} derived {{performance}} benefits {{due to the}} scaling down of CMOS microprocessor feature sizes towards packing billions of transistors on a chip, or <b>gigascale</b> <b>integration</b> (GSI). This has placed immense bandwidth demands on chip-to-chip and chip-to-board interconnects. The present-day electrical interconnect may limit bandwidth as transmission rates grow. As such, optical interconnects have been proposed as a potential solution. A critical requirement for enabling chip-to-chip and chip-to-board optical interconnection is out-of-plane coupling for directing light between a chip and the board. Any solution for this problem must be compatible with conventional packaging and assembly requirements. This research addresses the prospects for integrating waveguides with mirrors and polymer pillar optical I/O interconnects to provide such a compatible, out-of-plane, chip-to-board packaging solution through the design, analysis, fabrication, and testing of its constituent parts and their ultimate integration.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop a pervasive wire sharing technique that can be easily applied across the entire range of on-chip interconnects in a very large scale integration (VLSI) system. A wave-pipelined multiplexed (WPM) routing technique that can be applied both intra-macrocell and inter-macrocell interconnects is proposed in this thesis. It is shown that an extensive application of the WPM routing technique can provide significant advantages in terms of area, power and performance.

Furthermore, the amount of transistors in a single die is increasing steadily over time towards <b>gigascale</b> <b>integration</b> (GSI) level. This development creates a noise and power dissipation problems into a system design. In addition to this, signaling over nanometer interconnects represents a major bottleneck in ULSI systems due to the dominant limitation of signal propagation delays. To a large extent, the on-chip signaling technique determines the reliability, speed, and power consumption of a network-on-chip (NoC). An efficient on-chip signaling scheme {{is the one that}} maximizes the data rate per pin, minimizes power dissipation, and provides good noise immunity. Such signaling convention can dramatically increase available data rate and hence system performance.

An exponential increase in on-chip integration is driving System-on-Chip (SoC) methodologies as a dominant design solution for gigascale ICs. Therefore, a second generation generic systems simulator (GENESYS) is developed to address a need for rapid assessment of technology/architecture tradeoffs for multi-billion transistor SoCs while maintaining the depth of core modeling codified {{in the hierarchy of}} limits. A newly developed system methodology incorporates a hiearchical block-based model, a dual interconnect distribution for both local and global interconnects, a generic on-chip bus model, and cell placement algorithms. A comparison of simulation results for five commercial SoC implementations shows increased accuracy in predicting die size, clock frequency, and total power dissipation. ITRS projections for future technology requirments are applied with results indicating that increasing static power dissipation is a key impediment to making continued improvements in chip performance. Additionally, simulations of a generic chip multi-processor architecture utilizing several interconnect schemes shows that the most promising candidate for the future of on-chip global interconnect networks will be hierarchical bus structures providing a high degree of connectivity while maintaining high operating frequencies.

40|$|As VLSI {{technology}} {{advances to}} <b>gigascale</b> <b>integration,</b> billions of transistors will be packed {{on a single}} chip working at gigahertz switching speed. As a result, {{a large number of}} simultaneous switching events in the circuitry can cause considerable noise over the power supply network. Power supply noise can cause severe performance degradation or introduce logic failures, and must be considered at each phase of the design process. In this research, we estimate the power supply noise, investigate its impact on circuit design and performance, and propose synthesis of power and ground networks for robust design. Both the resistive noise (IR drop) and the inductive noise (Ldi/dt) are addressed. The parasitic resistance (R), inductance (L) and capacitance (C) in the power supply network are explicitly formulated in the noise modeling. The power supply grids are modeled as a linear time invariant (LTI) RLC network. The switching events in the circuitry are approximated as time-varying current sources. An event-driven simulation based approach is used to extract the spatio-temporal correlations between the switching events for different input vectors. A time domain based approach and a frequency domain based approach are proposed for the analysis of the power supply noise. Experimental results on benchmark circuits show that the power supply noise can be as high as 35 % Vdd.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation is to derive a set of compact physical models addressing power integrity issues in high performance <b>gigascale</b> <b>integration</b> (GSI) systems and three-dimensional (3 -D) systems. The aggressive scaling of CMOS integrated circuits makes the design of power distribution networks a serious challenge. This is because the supply current and clock frequency are increasing, which increases the power supply noise. The scaling of the supply voltage slowed down in recent years, but the logic on the integrated circuit (IC) still becomes more sensitive to any supply voltage change because of the decreasing clock cycle and therefore noise margin. Excessive power supply noise can lead to severe degradation of chip performance and even logic failure. Therefore, power supply noise modeling and power integrity validation are of great significance in GSI systems and 3 -D systems. Compact physical models enable quick recognition of the power supply noise without doing dedicated simulations. In this dissertation, accurate and compact physical models for the power supply noise are derived for power hungry blocks, hot spots, 3 -D chip stacks, and chip/package co-design. The impacts of noise on transmission line performance are also investigated using compact physical modeling schemes. The models can help designers gain sufficient physical insights into the complicated power delivery system and tradeoff various important chip and package design parameters {{during the early stages}} of design.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotube}} {{field-effect transistor}} (CNFET) {{is one of}} the promising candidates as extensions to silicon CMOS devices. The CNFET, which is a 1 -D structure with a near-ballistic transport capability, can potentially offer excellent device characteristics and order-of-magnitude better energy-delay product over standard CMOS devices. Significant challenges in CNT synthesis prevent CNFETs today from achieving such ideal benefits. CNT density variation and metallic CNTs are the dominant type of CNT variations/imperfections that cause performance variation, large static power consumption, and yield degradation. We present an imperfection-aware design technique for CNFET digital VLSI circuits by: 1) Analytical models that are developed to analyze and quantify the effects of CNT density variation on device characteristics, gate and system levels delays. The analytical models, which were validated by comparison to real experimental/simulation data, enables us to examine the space of CNFET combinational, sequential and memory cells circuits to minimize delay variations. Using these model, we drive CNFET processing and circuit design guidelines to manage/overcome CNT density variation. 2) Analytical models that are developed to analyze the effects of metallic CNTs on device characteristics, gate and system levels delay and power consumption. Using our presented analytical models, which are again validated by comparison with simulation data, it is shown that the static power dissipation is a more critical issue than the delay and the dynamic power of CNFET circuits in the presence of m-CNTs. 3) CNT density variation and metallic CNTs can result in functional failure of CNFET circuits. The complete and compact model for CNFET probability of failure that consider CNT density variation and m-CNTs is presented. This analytical model is applied to analyze the logical functional failures.
