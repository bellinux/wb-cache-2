[...] According to CNN, [...] "Authorities also {{said they did not}} find any evidence linking [...] to the crime scene." [...] He had provided only basic facts that were publicly known and failed to provide any convincing details. His claim of drugging JonBenét was doubted because no drugs were found in her body during the autopsy. DNA samples taken from Karr did not match DNA found on JonBenét's body.|$|E

In addition to Saint <b>John</b> <b>Mark's</b> in Jerusalem, the Parish Church of Chester Hill with Sefton in the Diocese of Sydney (Anglican Church of Australia) is Saint <b>John</b> <b>Mark's</b> and it celebrated its patronal festival on September 27.

5000|$|Boyles {{received}} {{national attention}} in 1997 by his investigation and nearly constant {{talk about the}} death of JonBenét Ramsey.

50|$|Robert Marlowe Amparán is an American {{criminal}} defense attorney currently based in San Francisco, California. He became notable for successfully defending former JonBenét Ramsey murder suspect <b>John</b> <b>Mark</b> <b>Karr,</b> along with attorneys Gayle Gutekunst and Ben Prince, in his legal battle {{with the state of}} California on child pornography charges. After a series of defense motions, the case was eventually dismissed.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, <b>John</b> <b>Mark</b> <b>Karr</b> {{confessed to}} the murder of JonBenét Ramsey. He had become obsessed with the every detail of her murder and was extradited from Thailand.

5000|$|In 2008, {{the parents}} of JonBenet Ramsey were cleared as {{suspects}} in her 1996 murder following an analysis of touch DNA on her clothing.

The DNA also cleared <b>John</b> <b>Mark</b> <b>Karr,</b> a teacher who was arrested for the murders in 2006. The DNA was determined to belong to an unknown male. The case remains unsolved.|$|E
50|$|The {{photographs}} of the Sanchez brothers straddle both {{the real world and}} a fictional one. Often familiar places or situations are made to look sinister, and seemingly ordinary situations seem dangerous or uncomfortable. The Sanchez brothers take inspiration from real life events, media sources, or experiences they lived and translate them into a false reality that they create. They also photograph real people ‘playing’ themselves, such {{as in the case of}} their portrait of <b>John</b> <b>Mark</b> <b>Karr,</b> the man who (falsely) confessed to killing JonBenét Ramsey in 1996.|$|E

5000|$|In August 2006, an American teacher {{living abroad}} named <b>John</b> <b>Mark</b> <b>Karr</b> falsely {{confessed to the}} unsolved murder of JonBenét Ramsey, {{creating}} a media frenzy. Ramsey was found beaten and strangled {{in the basement of}} her family's home in Boulder, Colorado, in 1996. Karr said he was present when Ramsey died and called her death an [...] "accident". Karr was arrested in Bangkok, Thailand, on August 16, 2006, by Thai authorities, then released to U.S. agents and flown first to Los Angeles, California, then to Boulder for further investigation. On August 28, prosecutors announced they had decided not to pursue charges in connection with the murder after DNA tests failed to place Karr at the scene. Karr was held in Boulder until September 12, 2006, when he was transported to Sonoma County, California to face unrelated misdemeanor child pornography charges. Mr. Amparán agreed to represent him. On September 20, 2006 Amparán was quoted as saying of Karr that he was a [...] "Southern gentleman with a sense of humor." [...] The case was dismissed on October 5, 2006.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{we used a}} fact pattern {{similar to}} the <b>John</b> <b>Mark</b> <b>Karr</b> {{scenario}} to examine perceptions of DNA and confession evidence. Specifi cally, we hypoth-esized that DNA evidence, confessor level of psychopathology, and {{presence or absence of}} Miranda protections would affect participants ’ perceptions of guilt and attitudes towards the interrogation process. One hundred nine undergraduates read a two-page summary based on John Mark Karr’s confession. Summaries varied based on psychopathology of confessor, {{the presence or absence of}} DNA evidence, and the provision of Miranda warnings prior to confession. The DNA manipulation explained participants ’ attitudes towards specifi c aspects of the in-terrogation process. The importance of perceptions of forensic type evidence, spe-cifi cally DNA, in our legal system is discussed...|$|E
