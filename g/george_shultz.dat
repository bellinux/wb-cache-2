5|$|The Nixon {{presidency}} {{witnessed the}} first large-scale integration {{of public schools}} in the South. Nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist Wallace and liberal Democrats, whose support of integration was alienating some Southern whites. Hopeful of doing well in the South in 1972, he sought to dispose of desegregation as a political issue before then. Soon after his inauguration, he appointed Vice President Agnew to lead a task force, which worked with local leaders—both white and black—to determine how to integrate local schools. Agnew had little interest in the work, and most of it was done by Labor Secretary <b>George</b> <b>Shultz.</b> Federal aid was available, and a meeting with President Nixon was a possible reward for compliant committees. By September 1970, less than ten percent of black children were attending segregated schools. By 1971, however, tensions over desegregation surfaced in Northern cities, with angry protests over the busing of children to schools outside their neighborhood to achieve racial balance. Nixon opposed busing personally but enforced court orders requiring its use.|$|E

500|$|Mint Director Mary Brooks had {{attended}} the Advisory Committee meetings. [...] At one meeting, she supported having a 1776–1976 double date on circulating coins {{to mark the}} anniversary in 1976, although accommodating two dates on the obverse would involve production difficulties. [...] However, in a newspaper interview she termed the idea of changing the six circulating coins (cent through dollar) [...] "a disaster". [...] She felt if any Bicentennial coin was issued, it should be non-circulating, perhaps a half cent or a gold piece. [...] Brooks believed that such a coin would not disrupt the Mint {{in the production of}} coins for circulation. [...] During 1972, however, she retreated from that position, {{and by the end of}} the year had persuaded Treasury Secretary <b>George</b> <b>Shultz</b> to support a Bicentennial coin bill.|$|E
500|$|The {{funeral was}} {{attended}} by 32 heads of state, 15 heads of government, 14 foreign ministers and four princes. Among the foreign dignitaries to attend the funeral were Indira Gandhi of India, Pierre Mauroy of France, Babrak Karmal of Afghanistan, Fidel Castro of Cuba, Huang Hua of China, Yasser Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Wojciech Jaruzelski of Poland, Mengistu Haile Mariam of Ethiopia, Moussa Traoré of Mali, Erich Honecker of East Germany, [...] Nicolae Ceaușescu of Romania and Hafez al-Assad of Syria, among others. [...] Assad declared seven days of mourning in Syria when Brezhnev's death was announced. Also in attendance was Pierre Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, who brought along his son and future Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Ronald Reagan, the President of the United States, did not attend but sent a delegation headed by Vice President George H. W. Bush. Secretary of State <b>George</b> <b>Shultz,</b> Central Intelligence Agency Director William Casey and National Security Advisor William P. Clark tried to persuade Reagan to attend the funeral. Reagan rejected the idea; furthermore, he stated {{that he had no}} intention to alter US policy towards the Soviet Union because of Brezhnev's death.|$|E
500|$|On 17 June 1985, National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane wrote a National Security Decision Directive {{which called}} for the United States to begin a {{rapprochement}} with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The paper read:Dynamic political evolution is taking place inside Iran. Instability caused by {{the pressures of the}} Iraq-Iran war, economic deterioration and regime in-fighting create the potential for major changes inside Iran. The Soviet Union is better positioned than the U.S. to exploit and benefit from any power struggle that results in changes from the Iranian regime...The U.S should encourage Western allies and friends to help Iran meet its import requirements so as to reduce the attractiveness of Soviet assistance...This includes provision of selected military equipment. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger was highly negative, writing on his copy of McFarlane's paper: [...] "This is almost too absurd to comment on...like asking Qaddafi to Washington for a cozy chat." [...] Secretary of State <b>George</b> <b>Shultz</b> was also opposed, stating that having designated Iran a State Sponsor of Terrorism in January 1984, how could the United States possibly sell arms to Iran? Only the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency William Casey supported McFarlane's plan to start selling arms to Iran.|$|E

500|$|After the May 1987 Gary Hart–Donna Rice scandal, a {{questionnaire}} by The New York Times requested {{things such as}} psychiatric records and access to FBI files from all 14 presidential candidates. Candidates from each party expressed opinions {{on both sides of}} the personal privacy issue, and Kemp rejected the Times inquiry as [...] "beneath the dignity of a presidential candidate". His campaign was on an early positive course with many key early endorsements in New Hampshire, but Bush held the support of much of the Republican establishment in New York. Although he had an eclectic mix of supporters, Kemp's campaign began borrowing against anticipated Federal matching funds because it had quickly spent itself into the red, which may have been due to the use of expensive direct mail fundraising techniques. To offset his socially moderate stances, Kemp clarified his opposition to abortion, his support of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) and his support for a stronger military than that favored by Secretary of State <b>George</b> <b>Shultz.</b> To position himself as Reagan's successor, Kemp called for Shultz's resignation based on claims that Shultz had neglected freedom fighters in Afghanistan and Nicaragua and had waffled on SDI. In an attempt to highlight his stands on key Reagan Era foreign policy initiatives, Kemp traveled in September 1987 to Costa Rica, Honduras and El Salvador to lobby the presidents of those nations against the Arias Peace Plan—a peace accord US conservatives felt too conciliatory to Central American communists. He was accompanied on the trip by 50-plus US conservative leaders.|$|E
500|$|Two days later, Reagan {{met with}} his advisors at the White House, where a new plan was introduced. This one called for a slight change in the arms transactions: instead of the weapons going to the [...] "moderate" [...] Iranian group, {{they would go to}} [...] "moderate" [...] Iranian army leaders. As each weapons {{delivery}} was made from Israel by air, the hostages held by Hezbollah would be released. Israel would continue to be reimbursed by the United States for the weapons. Though staunchly opposed by Secretary of State <b>George</b> <b>Shultz</b> and Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, the plan was authorized by Reagan, who stated that, [...] "We were not trading arms for hostages, nor were we negotiating with terrorists". In his notes of a meeting held in the White House on 7 December 1985, Weinberger wrote he told Reagan that this plan was illegal, writing: I argued strongly that we have an embargo that makes arms sales to Iran illegal and President couldn't violate it and that 'washing' transactions thru Israel wouldn't make it legal. Shultz, Don Regan agreed. Weinberger's notes has Reagan saying he [...] "could answer charges of illegality but he couldn't answer charge that 'big strong President Reagan' passed up a chance to free hostages". Now retired National Security Advisor McFarlane flew to London to meet with Israelis and Ghorbanifar in an attempt to persuade the Iranian to use his influence to release the hostages before any arms transactions occurred; this plan was rejected by Ghorbanifar.|$|E
