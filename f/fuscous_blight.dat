40|$|Common blight and <b>fuscous</b> <b>blight</b> {{bacterial}} diseases are important diseases of beans in many production {{areas of the}} United States. Effective and reliable inoculation methods to identify tolerant and susceptible disease reactions are needed in breeding beans tolerant to these pathogens. The research reported in this thesis involved the comparison of leaf water-soaking and stem inoculation procedures. The experiments were conducted in three different environments. Field plots were grown at Lincoln and the Scotts Bluff Station and inoculated with common blight and <b>fuscous</b> <b>blight</b> bacteria. A greenhouse study, in which the common blight organism was used, was also conducted. In both locations in the field, the spray inoculation produced good visual symptoms of both diseases. This method {{can be used to}} inoculate rapidly large populations of plants. Under field conditions the scalpel method gave poor visual disease symptoms. A large number of plants showed stem breakage when this method was used. The scalpel method requires a great amount of time and would not be a good method where large plant populations are involved. The Tepary varieties showed no visual disease symptoms when inoculated with both organisms. G. N. Nebraska # 1 selection 27, G. N. Tara, and California Small White showed good tolerance to the bacteria causing both diseases. The greenhouse study indicated that the scalpel method might be very useful in distinguishing degrees of susceptibility. Under greenhouse conditions the spray method showed G. N. 1140 and Tendercrop to be similar in susceptibility. However, almost all the Tendercrop plants {{died as a result of}} the scalpel inoculation while plants of the G. N. 1140 only showed slight stunting. Advisor:Dermot P. Coyn...|$|E
40|$|Studies on {{the seed}} {{transmission}} of Xanthomonas campestris PV phaseoli check for this species in other resources (XCP) that cause common and <b>fuscous</b> <b>blight</b> of beans {{were conducted in}} Uganda. Bean seed was {{the main source of}} primary inoculum. The population of XCP in farmers', commercial and research seeds averaged 105 109 colony forming units (cfu) per 100 seeds; the levels of seed infection were 0. 3 - 16. 1 %. There was a positive correlation between seed symptoms and population of XCP per seed. However, where seed was either slightly diseased or symptomless, XCP did not decrease bean germination irrespective of population density. The minimum population of XCP required to initiate infection in the field was 102 cfu per seed while 0. 2 % seed infection level resulted in serious disease incidence. Peer-reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Both {{the common}} {{bacterial}} blight (CBB) pathogen (Xanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli) and X. fuscans subsp. fuscans, agent of <b>fuscous</b> <b>blight,</b> cause indistinguishable symptoms in common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris. Yield losses can exceed 40 %. Lack {{of information about}} the specificity between X. campestris pv. phaseoli strains and major quantitative trait loci (QTL) or alleles conferring resistance makes the task of identifying genetic changes in host–pathogen interactions and the grouping of bacterial strains difficult. This, in turn, affects the choice of pathogen isolates used for germplasm screening and complicates breeding for CBB resistance. Common bean host genotypes carrying various sources and levels of resistance to CBB were screened with 69 X. campestris pv. phaseoli and 15 X. fuscans subsp. fuscans strains from around the world. Differential pathogenicity of the CBB pathogen was identified on the 12 selected bean genotypes. The X. fuscans subsp. fuscans strains showed greater pathogenicity than X. campestris pv. phaseoli strains having the same origin. African strains were most pathogenic. The largest variation in pathogenicity came from X. campestris pv. phaseoli strains that originated in Caribbean and South American countries. Pathogenic variation was greater within X. campestris pv. phaseoli than within X. fuscans subsp. fuscans strains. Implications for breeding for CBB resistance are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Diseases {{are one of}} the {{limiting}} factors to bean production in L. A. The prevalency and severity of the disease depends on the quantity of inoculum existing in the region, environmental conditions {{and the quality of the}} seed used. Data are given on geographic distribution, favorable climatic conditions for development, symptomatology, vectors, type of damage caused and control measures, including var. resistant to (1) fungal diseases, the most numerous and causing the most damage: rust, anthracnose, angular leaf spot, root rot, web blight, gray spot, powdery mildew; (2) virus diseases, some of economic importance transmitted by aphids (BCMV, BYMV); transmitted by whiteflies (BGMV, bean chlorotic mottle, euphorbia mosaic); transmitted by chrysomelids (BRMV, pod mottle, BSMV, yellow mottle); (3) bacterial diseases are few but can be a serious limitation to the crop: common and <b>fuscous</b> <b>blights,</b> halo blight; and (4) nematodes: Meloidogyne sp., Trichodorus spp., Pratylenchus spp., Heterodera spp. (CIAT...|$|R
40|$|Common and <b>fuscous</b> <b>blights</b> of bean are {{diseases}} {{widely distributed}} in the world. The most commonly observed symptoms are spots on leaves, stems, pods and seeds. In December 2009, bean plants cv. Uirapuru showing symptoms of wilt similar to those induced by Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens were observed in a commercial crop located in the county of Itararé, State of São Paulo, Brazil. The plants were at the last cycle stage with mature pods and these symptoms were noted {{in the majority of}} the growing area. Optical microscopic observations of discolored vascular tissue from diseased stems revealed the presence of bacterial masses oozed from infected tissue, indicating that the disease was caused by bacterial pathogen. Isolations on nutrient agar showed circular, convex, yellow colonies with smooth edges. The causal bacterium was Gramnegative and produced a dark brown pigment in culture medium. Biochemical, cultural and physiological tests confirmed its identity as Xanthomonas fuscans subsp. fuscans(syn. Xanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli&# 8220;var. fuscans"). The pathogenicity of the isolates was confirmed by artificial inoculations. Systemic infection has been reported in the literature but these kinds of symptoms are not currently observed in Brazilian fields. Bacterial strains were deposited on the Phytobacteria Culture Collection of Instituto Biológico (IBSBF - www. biologico. sp. gov. br/bacterias/php) under accession numbers 2813 and 3028...|$|R
