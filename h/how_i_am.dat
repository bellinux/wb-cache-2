500|$|Meyer-Landrut {{decided to}} take part in the talent show Unser Star für Oslo (Our Star for Oslo), a newly created {{national}} television programme to select the German entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 in Oslo. The show was organised by public broadcaster ARD and private television station ProSieben, as well as entertainer, music producer and former Eurovision entrant Stefan Raab. Among 4,500 entrants, Meyer-Landrut was picked as one of the 20 contestants for the show. Asked about her motivation to apply, she stated, [...] "I like to test myself. I wanted to see <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> perceived, and I wanted to hear what people with knowledge have to say about it. I personally can't judge myself at all." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{references}} drugs both metaphorically and literally, and innocently {{delivers a}} transgressive message {{through the use}} of simile: [...] "I'm going to do you like drugs tonight". Miguel said of the song's lyrics, [...] "I have this propensity to just come out and say things. That's <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> in real life. If I wanna know something I just ask. Like, 'Hey, do you like drugs?' Because I do! Sometimes! ... MDMA… on occasion." [...] Alex Macpherson of The Guardian observes [...] "faded psychedelia" [...] and [...] "promises of narcotic [...] " [...] in the song's lyrics. Pitchfork Medias Carrie Battan said that [...] "Do You..." [...] is [...] "not so much about being in love as about a shared love of vices." ...|$|E
500|$|Martyn Williams {{remained}} {{in the dressing room}} for 90 minutes after the game, and when he emerged opted not to speak to the media. He later did give his reaction, expressing his opinion that the format {{was a bit of a}} lottery and observed [...] "somebody was going to miss – I've just got to live with the fact that it was me." [...] He also credited several of the victorious Leicester players who had commiserated with him after the game and others who had sent messages of support to him. Jordan Crane said after the match that he had felt calm prior to taking his kick, as Williams' miss meant that in the event Crane also missed, the scores would remain level and sudden death would continue. Tom James who had missed a kick earlier in the shoot-out which would have won the match for Cardiff said that [...] "gutted is the only word that properly describes <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> feeling".|$|E
5000|$|The phrase [...] "how dry I am" [...] {{had become}} {{structured}} into song and referred specifically to drinking alcohol {{by at least}} 1898, as one journal describes a college drinking song that goes: <b>How</b> dry <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>How</b> dry <b>I</b> <b>am!</b> God only knows <b>How</b> dry <b>I</b> am.A 1919 book entitled Out and about: A Note-book of London in War-time describes a group of Americans drinking in London and singing [...] "some excellent numbers of American marching-songs," [...] including one described as [...] "the anthem of the 'dry' States" [...] whose lyrics were:Nobody knows <b>how</b> dry <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>How</b> dry <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>How</b> dry <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> You don't know <b>how</b> dry <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>How</b> dry <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>How</b> dry <b>I</b> am.Nobody knows <b>how</b> dry <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> And nobody cares a damn.The 1921 musical comedy Up In The Clouds included a similar song entitled [...] "How Dry I Am" [...] with music by Tom A. Johnstone and words by Will B. Johnstone.|$|R

500|$|On May 21, 2014, in {{a vote of}} 390–33, the House of Representatives {{passed the}} Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act of 2014 (H.R. 4031; 113th Congress). The bill would give the Secretary of Veterans Affairs the {{authority}} to remove or demote any individual from the Senior Executive Service upon determining that such individual's performance warrants removal or demotion. The House members who sponsored the bill argued that, although federal workers can be fired, the process is extremely lengthy, sometimes taking years, and that the officials who are [...] "under scrutiny for neglecting veterans actually received {{tens of thousands of}} dollars in bonuses and positive performance reviews." [...] Florida Republican Representative Jeff Miller, who sponsored the bill, said that [...] "this bill would simply give the VA Secretary the authority to fire or demote VA Senior Executive Service employees based on performance, similar to the authority the Secretary of Defense already has to remove military general officers from command or <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> able to fire someone who works for me on my staff." ...|$|E
500|$|Discussing his beliefs, in 2009 Ebert {{wrote that}} he did not [...] "want to provide a {{category}} for people to apply to [...] " [...] because he [...] "would not want [...] convictions reduced to a word", and stated, [...] "I have never said, although readers have freely informed me I am an atheist, an agnostic, {{or at the very least}} a secular humanist– which I am". In the same blog entry, he also said [...] "I am not a believer, not an atheist, not an agnostic. I am still awake at night, asking <b>how?</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> more content with the question than I would be with an answer." [...] In March 2013, he wrote: [...] "I support freedom of choice. My choice is to not support abortion, except in cases of a clear-cut choice between the lives of the mother and child. A child conceived through incest or rape is innocent and deserves the right to be born." [...] He also stated: [...] "I consider myself Catholic, lock, stock and barrel, with this technical loophole: I cannot believe in God. I refuse to call myself an atheist however, because that indicates too great a certainty about the unknowable." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Check My Brain" [...] {{features}} the lyric [...] "California's all right/Somebody check my brain...". The lyric is {{in reference to}} guitarist Jerry Cantrell moving to Los Angeles, California in 2003, with Cantrell commenting, [...] "I like <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> right now...and I like where I'm living." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the Lakers {{once again}} won the title in Game 7 of the 2010 Finals, Bryant {{was asked what}} it meant to him personally. He responded, [...] "Just one more than Shaq ... I can take that to the bank." [...] Bryant had won five NBA titles, and O'Neal had won four. Bryant added, [...] "You guys know <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> I don't forget anything." [...] O'Neal again congratulated Bryant on his Twitter page: [...] "Congratulations Kobe, u deserve it. U played great. Enjoy it man enjoy it.

2500|$|In Paris, {{prominent}} physician Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard diagnosed Sumner's {{condition as}} spinal cord damage {{that he could}} treat by burning the skin along the spinal cord. Sumner chose to refuse anesthesia, which was thought to reduce {{the effectiveness of the}} procedure. [...] Observers both at the time and since doubt Brown-Séquard's efforts were of value. After spending weeks recovering from these treatments, [...] Sumner resumed his touring, this time traveling as far east as Dresden and Prague and south to Italy twice. [...] In France he visited Brittany and Normandy, as well as Montpellier. [...] He wrote his brother: [...] "If anyone cares to know <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> doing, you can say better and better." ...|$|E
2500|$|Outhwaite has {{suggested}} that the wardrobe department struggled {{to come up with a}} static identity for Melanie at first; however, this she felt turned out to be a good thing: [...] "What I really liked about it was, when we started looking for costumes , the wardrobe department couldn't quite fit where I was going. I'd wear Army pants and trainers some days and then jeans some other days and then I'd be all suited and booted at other times. I said, 'That's what girls do! That's <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> Some days I'm in scruffs and some days I'm really dressed up. It would be really nice to have a character who's not so predictable.'" [...] Rosalind Powell, head of the EastEnders wardrobe design team in 2000, said that Mel had [...] "colourful and stylish" [...] wardrobe from retailers such as Kookai and Oasis. Powell added, [...] "Although she's a barmaid, she can still afford to wear nice clothes, she just doesn't have a very big wardrobe." ...|$|E
40|$|<b>I</b> have <b>been</b> {{teaching}} {{in higher education}} {{for most of the}} past twenty years, long enough to do it without much thought or reflection, doing pretty much the same thing semester after semester. This is the story of <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> challenged to think about what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing and <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing it, and to experiment with new ways of effectively engaging my students in the process of learning. It meant changing almost everything in the midst of the semester. It was both challenging and exciting...|$|R
5000|$|Marie {{talked about}} her {{experience}} of using the Support Forum:“I was scared to tell anyone <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> feeling, so <b>I</b> used the Support Forum at first.
