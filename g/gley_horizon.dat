40|$|Paleosols crop {{out in the}} Sukhona River valley {{as several}} members up to 10 m thick {{embedded}} into the Salarevo Formation sediments. Principal characteristics of the paleosols include a dense network of root channels, indications of eluvial gley alteration, redistribution and formation of secondary carbonates represented by several generations, and formation of block-prismatic soil structure with specific clayey films at structural jointing faces. The paleosols are divided {{into a number of}} genetically interrelated horizons (from top to bottom) : presumably organogenic accumulation (AElg), eluvial <b>gley</b> <b>horizon</b> (Elg), illuvial horizons (B 1 and B 2), illuvial <b>gley</b> <b>horizon</b> (Bg), and transitional horizons (ElBg and BElg). The paleosols formed under conditions of a semiarid climate with sharp seasonal or secular and multisecular oscillations of atmospheric precipitation.

40|$|This study aims to {{characterize}} the morphology of the soil cover and a depression and hypotheses of its origin. The methodological basis was a Structural Coverage Analysis Pedologic integrating the recognition of soil cover from four (4) steps: i) topographic survey; ii) auger; iii) elaboration of toposequency; iv) opening trench. Based on the recognition of realized and pedological cover the preparation of a map of landforms in the area, from photointerpretation techniques in aerial photography, {{it was possible to}} identify the existence of small depressed areas aligned {{in the bottom of the}} depression. The elaborate toposequency showed that soil cover features eight (8) soil horizons and a vertical drop of approximately 9 m from the top of the slope to the onset of depression. The advancement of <b>gley</b> <b>horizon</b> and merge depressed areas with higher elevations, from depression, following upstream in shed may be a sign of a remontant evolution (from downstream to upstream) of depression. The origin of depression may be related to loss of material due to geochemical dissolution. It was possible to establish six (6) stages of evolution of depression...|$|E
40|$|Spatio-temporal {{variations}} in {{nitrogen and phosphorus}} concentrations in groundwater were analysed and related to the {{variations in}} hydrological conditions, vegetation type and substrate in an alluvial ecosystem. This {{study was conducted in}} the Illwald forest in the Rhine Plain (eastern France) to assess the removal of nutrients from groundwater in a regularly flooded area. We compared both forest and meadow ecosystems on clayey-silty soils with an anoxic horizon (pseudogley) at 1 • 5 – 2 m depth (eutric gley soil) and a forest ecosystem on a clayey-silty fluviosoil rich in organic matter with a gley at 0 • 5 m depth (calcaric gley soil). Piezometers were used to measure the nutrient concentrations in the groundwater at 2 m depth in the root layer and at 4 • 5 m depth, below the root layer. Lower concentrations of nitrate and phosphate in groundwater were observed under forest than under meadow, which could be explained by more efficient plant uptake by woody species than herbaceous plants. Thus NO 3 -N inputs by river floods were reduced by 73 % in the shallow groundwater of the forested ecosystem, and only by 37 % in the meadow. Compared with the superficial groundwater layer, the lowest level of nitrate nitrogen (NO 3 -N) and the highest level of ammonium nitrogen (NH 4 -N) were measured in the deep layer (under the <b>gley</b> <b>horizon</b> at 2 • 5 m depth), which suggests that the reducing potential of the anoxic horizon in the gley soils contributes to the reduction of nitrate. Nitrate concentrations were higher in the groundwater of the parcel rich in organic matter than in the one poorer in organic matter. Phosphate (PO 4 -P) concentrations in both shallow and deep groundwater are less than 62 to 76 % of those found in surface water which can be related to the retention capacity of the clay colloids of these soils. Moreover, the temporal variations in nutrient concentrations in groundwater are directly related to variations in groundwater level during an annual hydrological cycle. Our results suggest that variations in groundwater level regulate spatio-temporal variations in nutrient concentrations in groundwater {{as a result of the}} oxidation–reduction status of soil, which creates favourable or unfavourable conditions for nutrient bioavailability. The hydrological variations are much more important than those concerning substrate and type of vegetation...|$|E

These deposits, which have accumulated at the valley margins, result from deflation of fluvian sediments deposited in the valley bottom. Fine horizontal lamination in the upper horizons is tentatively attributed to winnow-ing of primary depositional units following partial cementation by salt precipitates. This stratification breaks down at depth and is replaced by a <b>gleyed</b> <b>horizon,</b> result-ing from drainage impedance by permafrost.

40|$|International audienceAnisotropy of {{magnetic}} susceptibility (AMS) is {{employed as a}} tool to unravel the depositional history of the 17 m thick Nussloch P 8 Weichselian loess sequence located 10 km south of Heidelberg, Germany. Through an AMS study, the primary aeolian depositional origin of the magnetic fabrics is evaluated, and overprinting due to postdepositional reworking and/or deformation is identified. Primary fabrics along the P 8 sequence are defined by near-vertical K MIN axes and horizontal foliations. Eight intervals display secondary fabrics, characterized by either prolate orientation distributions or oblate orientation distributions with dipping foliation planes. These postdepositional fabrics are associated with laminated loess and tundra <b>gley</b> <b>horizons.</b> It is proposed that increased moisture (due to higher precipitation or enhanced snowmelt) and repeated cryogenic processes were able to reorganize and rework the accumulated loess. Primary aeolian fabrics are archived within 6. 45 m of cumulated depth or 38 % of the profile and dominantly within the Upper Pleniglacial units. Even though maximum susceptibility axes of primary fabrics are statistically well resolved at the specimen (ε 12 = 10. 1 ° ± 8. 6) and population (ε 12 = 6 °) level, any inferred paleowind directions from the magnetic lineation remains speculative given the low concentration of ferrimagnetic minerals (< 0. 03 wt %). Tundra <b>gley</b> <b>horizons</b> upprofile display primary magnetic fabrics and no major changes in the degree of anisotropy or AMS orientation distributions. This suggests a weakening in gley-induced diagenesis and therefore favorable environmental conditions needed (moisture and presence of permafrost active layer) to initiate their formation in loess deposits. Finally, pedogenesis has not {{played an important role in}} modifying the magnetic fabric since paleosols display the same magnetic fabrics observed in primary loess...|$|R
40|$|Gray {{hydromorphic}} {{soils are}} imperfectly to poorly drained soils that {{occur on the}} coastal fringes of the Hawaiian Islands on surfaces of Pleistocene to Recent age. Mottling is characteristic of the soils, and <b>gley</b> <b>horizons</b> occur in the more hydromorphic soils in the group. As the soils become hydromorphic, soil color values increase and structures deteriorate. Halloysite is the dominant clay mineral in the less hydromorphic soils and montmorillonite is dominant in the more hydromorphic soils of the group. The montmorillonite is iron-rich and in one soil has the formula (XO. 74 Ko. 1 l) (Si 7. 52 Al 0. 48) ^IV (Al 1. 85 Fe 1. 60 ^ 3 +MgO. 35 Ti 0. l 0) ^VI O 20 (OH) 4. Hydrated halloysite occurs in all the soils studied, but it is most abundant in the more hydromorphic soils. Although the soils are derived from different alluvial materials, the trend of increasing montmorillonite and increasing hydrated halloysite with increasing hydromorphism is clearly related to the pedogenic processes operating in the soils. Similar mineralogical trends are found with increasing depth in each soil...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{analyses}} {{have been}} carried out in permafrost environment in Victoria Land, Continental Antarctica, in 9 sites, located along a latitudinal and geographical transect, covering 5 degrees (77 ° - 72 °S). The samples have been collected in correspondence of long term monitoring sites within the network of the sensitive system permafrost-vegetation established for the assessment of climate change effects (Cannone and Guglielmin, 2003). Within each site the samples have been collected in different ecological and environmental conditions concerning active layer thickness, vegetation type and coverage, substrata, occurrence of glacial and periglacial features. In each site the vertical profile of the ground have been described and the samples have been collected within the active layer representing all the layers with visible differences regarding texture, structure and color. Organic C and N show specific patterns allowing to discriminate: a) vegetated vs unvegetated sites; b) among the unvegetated sites, ground with and without disturbance processes, mainly represented by frost heave and salt concrections. The barren grounds with frost heave and/or salt efflorescences show highest values of organic C and N. The highest value of organic C is associated to a buried <b>gley</b> <b>horizon,</b> and is compatible with the low rate of organic matter mineralization associated to the anaerobic environment producing this kind of layers. The vertical distribution of the measured parameters show regular patterns, with lower values at the surface, the maximum value at intermediate depth, and a decrease in the deeper parts of the profile. These depths are consistent with the values of active layer thickness characterizing the different sites. In the vegetated sites, organic C and N show different patterns related to the vegetation type and to their ecological requirements in terms of nutrient regime. The higher values are associated in particular with moss communities and with ground colonized by nitrophytic epilithic lichens. On inundated grounds the content of both organic C and N show an increase respect to sites located in the close nearby and with a similar vegetation occurring. This fact indicates the lower speed of mineralization processes of the organic substances and a tendency to peat production and accumulation. The vertical distribution of both organic C and N show two different patterns: a) the same pattern characterising the unvegetated sites, with the maximum values occurring at intermediate depth; b) a different accumulation rate, with the highest values associated to the more surficial layers and a progressive decrease with depth. The former one is typical of vegetation composed by lichens, indipendently from their growth form. The latter pattern is typical of moss communities developing directly on the ground and indicates that the greatest part of the organic substances is strictly associated to these living organisms. These patterns, as well as those associated to disturbance processes in the unvegetated sites, are highly susceptible of significant variations in response to climate change effects. Therefore, it is essential to include their analysis within the monitoring activities planned for the network of the sensitive system permafrost-vegetation as indicators of functional processes occurring in the physical environment and in the associated ecosystems. Furthermore, it is planed to study CO 2 fluxes and the involved microbial community along the transect for understanding the carbon dynamic under changing environmental conditions...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTIn the Porto Alegre {{metropolitan}} region (PAMR) {{there are}} {{a significant proportion of}} floodplain soils, mainly Planosols and Gleysols, in relation to upland soils. This study aimed to evaluate the morphological, chemical and physical characteristics, and to classify floodplain soils in the PAMR. Six soil profiles were evaluated under different sedimentary lithologies and drainage classes, and samples were collected for chemical and physical analyzes. Two orders of mineral soils (Planosols and Gleysols) and one order of organic soil (Organosols) were identified. The soils were moderately deep to deep and stratified. In mineral soils hue ranged between 7. 5 YR and 2. 5 Y, with the occurrence of Bg, Btg or Cg <b>gley</b> <b>horizons,</b> while in organic soil the colors were neutral. Sand and silt were the predominant particle sizes according to the origin sedimentary deposits. The organic carbon content was negatively related to soil density and positively related to soil specific surface area and with soil cation exchange capacity. Soil chemical characterization showed expressive variation in bases, aluminum and sodium saturation. Ki index and Fe(CBD) /Fe(H 2 SO 4) ratio indicated a low soil weathering degree. The different sedimentary lithologies and the soil hydromorphism degree were the main factors related to differences in morphological, physical and chemical characteristics of soils in the PAMR...|$|R

At {{the request of the}} provincial government of North Holland, this area and adjoining polders were investigated. The study of profiles and fossil <b>gley</b> <b>horizons</b> allowed assessment of former water tables and provided data for the plan to replenish the reserve of fresh water by surface water from the rivers in the central parts of the coastal dune area of the Netherlands. North Kennemerland consists of old dunes (beach barriers or ridges), young dunes, peat and marine deposits. After the formation of the old marine sand and beach ridges (4000 - 2000 B. C.) the sea broke in and deposited sandy inland deltas (300 B. C.) After reconsolidation of the shore banks, peat started to grow again, till a new transgression (4 th- 9 th century) caused the deposition of the 'knip' clay, which was superficially eroded two centuries later (shallow inland lake-formation). The properties of this clay were studied and yielded a theory on genesis. The absence of CACO 3, brackish water and high adsorption of Mg 2 + seemed to be responsible for the formation of this compact sticky and poorly structured soil. <p/...|$|R
40|$|Gravelly clay loamy and clayey soils {{developed}} from the derivatives of ultramafic rocks of the dunite-harzburgite complex of the Rai-Iz massif in the Polar Urals have been studied. They are represented by raw-humus pelozems (weakly developed clayey soils) under conditions of perfect drainage on steep slopes and by the gleyzems (Gleysols) with vivid gley color patterns in the eluvial positions on leveled elements of the relief. The magnesium released from the silicates with the high content of this element (mainly from olivine) specifies the neutral-alkaline reaction in these soils. Cryoturbation, the accumulation of raw humus, the impregnation of the soil mass with humic substances, gleyzation, and the ferrugination of the <b>gleyed</b> <b>horizons</b> are also clearly pronounced in the studied soils. Despite the high pH values, the destruction of supergene smectites in the upper horizons and ferrugination (the accumulation of iron hydroxides) in the microfissures dissecting the grains of olivine, pyroxene, and serpentine, and in decomposing plant tissues take place. The development of these processes {{may be related to}} the local acidification (neutralization) of the soil medium under the impact of biota and carbonic acids. The specificity of gleyzation in the soils developing from ultra-mafic rocks is shown in the absence of iron depletion from the fine earth material against the background of the greenish blue gley color pattern...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDetailed stratigraphic {{analysis}} and numerical dating (OSL, IRSL, ESR, 14 C) of Pleistocene coversands in southwest France enable {{the construction of}} a renewed chronostratigraphic framework for sand deposition. The chronological data obtained from sandsheet units testify to the development of transgressive dunefields since at least the Middle Pleistocene (MIS 10). Three main phases of accumulation occurred during the Last Glacial. The oldest one (64 – 42 ka) is associated with wet sandsheet facies, histic horizons and zibar-type dune fields, which reflect deposition in a context strongly influenced by the groundwater table. The Late Pleniglacial (24 – 14 ka) corresponds to the main phase of coversand extension in a drier context. Silty <b>gley</b> <b>horizons</b> suggest, however, local interruptions of sand drifting during GS 2. 1. Lateglacial stabilization of the coversands may not have occurred before GI- 1 c (Allerød), which was typified by the development of cumulic arenosols. These were covered by parabolic dunes during the Younger Dryas. The variations in extent of the emerged continental shelf during the glacial–interglacial cycles may explain the uneven geographical distribution of sand deposition through time. Because of coastline retreat up to 100  km north of 45 °N during the LGM lowstand, the coversands were unable to reach {{the northern part of the}} basin. Comparison with other European regions highlights stronger affinities of the French record with Portugal than with the Netherlands and Great Britain, probably because of reduced influence of permafros...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Small {{amounts of}} Fe(IlI) induce {{precipitation}} f Fe(II) from carbonate solutions around neutral pH values. The reaction involves {{the formation of}} Fe(II) Fe(IlI) hydroxy-carbonate, a green, layer-structured compound of the pyroaurite group of minerals. Variations in the concentration f Fe(II) in the solution phase, and in the form and amounts of the total Fe(III) in the system, may cause other phases uch as magnetite and siderite to form also. Freeze-dried Fe(II) Fe(III) hydroxy-carbonate undergoes topotactic alteration to a magnetic phase,!~resum-ably maghemite, when stored under vacuum. The compound is readily oxidized in air in either the moist or dry state, rapidly becoming yellow or yeUow-brown i colour.

The similarity between the rapid colour changes and the oxidation products of the blue-green precipitates in <b>gleyed</b> soil <b>horizons</b> and this Fe(II) Fe(III) hydroxy-carbonate leads to the speculation that his and related compounds may be the meta-stable precipitates in such soils, rather than a previously postulated hydro-magnetite phase.

40|$|In the past, {{contaminated}} soil {{as a source}} for water contamination has been largely neglected from the South African legislation. Inconsistent evaluation and remediation of contaminated sites have resulted in many sources of water contamination not being sufficiently addressed. The Draft National Norms and Standards for the Remediation of Contaminated Land and Soil Quality (GN 233 of 2012) (henceforth Norms and Standards) was published for comments and suggestions in August 2012. A number of uncertainties have been identified that may impact on the successful implementation of the Framework and the Norms and Standards. Some of the issues are related specifically to the setting of soil screening values (SSV) for protection of water resources. There is no particular method specified to determine the soluble fraction of contaminants in soil. In a phase 1 assessment SSVs are used to judge whether constituents present in the soils are at concentrations high enough to pose a potential risk to the receiving environment. With the determination of the SSV a known water quality standard is converted to a total concentration by making use of a dilution factor and partitioning coefficient (Kd). The proposed Kd values in the Framework are surrounded by uncertainties and information regarding Kd values for South African soils are limited. In addition, the Framework {{does not take into account}} the natural background concentration of soils to differentiate between anthropogenic and natural contamination. Setting appropriate extraction method plays the key role for an objective and standardised initial assessment of soluble concentrations in the soil. Similarly, the selection of appropriate Kd values based on soil properties minimizes the uncertainties during the estimation of SSV. Appropriate screening of contaminated land is imperative to the registration of contaminated land and has significant implications for industry, government and the environment. The aims of this study were: a) to assess fast and simple analytical methodologies which can be performed by a commercial laboratory to mimic the standard saturated paste extraction method to determine soluble metal concentration in soils, b) to determine Kd values for selected South African soils in 10 soil horizons, and c) to determine baseline concentration ranges for selected soluble contaminants to assist in the setting of appropriate soil screening values for the protection of water resources. The study will test the hypothesis that a 1 : 2. 5 (soil:water ratio) water extraction could better mimic the standard saturated paste extraction than the 1 : 20 ratio, commonly used in USA. The 1 : 2. 5 ratio can be done by most commercial laboratories and gives a better indication of the pore water quality. To assess analytical methods, four extraction methods (1 : 2. 5, 1 : 5, 1 : 10 and 1 : 20 soil:water) were tested against the standard saturated paste extraction using three trace metals (Cu, Pb and V). These three metals were selected based on reactivity and environmental abundance. Lead and Cu are B type metals which complex readily with organic material and are generally more environmentally toxic. Anthropogenic activities are increasing enrichment of B type metals in the environment. Vanadate is an A type metal and is redox sensitive. Its association with the Bushveld complex was the reason for its inclusion in this study. The baseline soluble concentrations of Cu, Pb, and V were determined for selected 100 South African soils using the extraction method selected above. The Kd values of Cu, Pb, and V were determined for selected 10 soil horizons (1 : 1 clay dominated A horizon, Vertic soil dominated by 2 : 1 clay minerals, Yellow oxidic / Plinthic (Soft plinthic B horizon), low clay red oxidic B horizon, red oxidic B horizon, plinthic B <b>horizon,</b> <b>gleyed</b> <b>horizon</b> (G horizon), melanic A horizon, orthic A horizon with high organic content (OC) and E-horizon) using a batch method. For each constituent three different metal concentrations were added to each of the soil horizons. After extraction the concentration in the solution was used to determine the amount of metal sorbed to the soil. Considering the standard saturated paste extract as a bench mark, the 1 : 2. 5 soil:water ratio extraction gave more representative soil pore water quality for Cu, Pb and V in the low to medium concentrations. Therefore, the hypothesis was accepted. It was also apparent that the Kd values selected for the Framework are not representative of typical South African soils. The Kd values for Cu range between 12. 7 and 19044 L kg- 1. These values exceeded the value of 10 L kg- 1 provided by the Framework in all soils. For V the Kd values (10. 5 – 865 L kg- 1) in all soils were lower than the value of 1000 L kg- 1 specified in the Framework. For Pb, the Kd of 100 L kg- 1 as indicated in the Framework is not representative of soils found in South Africa. For Pb, low clay content, weathered soils have lower Kd values, whereas higher clay content soils have Kd values up to 4 orders of magnitude higher than the Kd in the Framework. Therefore, due to the large variability in Kd values, a single value cannot be used for all soil types. To conclude, the 1 : 2. 5 soil:water ratio was found to be more representative to the soil pore content especially in the low to medium solute concentrations. The study also showed that a single Kd value cannot be used across soil types. The Kd values currently used in the Framework have low representativity of the South African soils. In the meantime, the Kd values for Cu, Pb, and V generated from this study for selected South African soil horizons could be used by the framework. There is, however, a need to develop local Kd values of contaminants across soil types.

40|$|Iron (Fe) {{reduction}} and oxidation are important biogeochemical processes coupled to decomposition, nutrient cycling, and mineral weathering, but factors controlling their rates and spatial distribution with depth are poorly understood in terrestrial soils. In aquatic ecosystems, Fe reduction often occurs below {{a zone of}} oxic sediments. We tested an alternative conceptual model for Fe redox cycling in terrestrial soils using a deep humid tropical forest soil profile. We hypothesized that Fe reduction in anaerobic microsites scales with depth variation in labile C and Fe availability, as opposed to bulk oxygen (O 2). We measured bulk O 2 at multiple depths from 0. 1 to 5 m quasi-continuously over 18 months and sampled soils from surface to bedrock (~ 7 m). Median O 2 mixing ratios declined from 19. 8 ± 1. 2 % at 0. 25 m to 16. 1 ± 1. 0 % at 1 m, but did not consistently decrease below 1 m, challenging a recent model of regolith development. Reduced Fe (Fe(II)) extractable in 0. 5 M hydrochloric acid was greatest in 0 – 0. 1 m soil and declined precipitously with depth, and did not correspond with visible <b>gleying</b> in B <b>horizons.</b> We observed similar depth trends in potential Fe reduction under anaerobic conditions. Depth trends in Fe(II) also closely mirrored short-term soil respiration and bulk soil C. Labile C stimulated Fe reduction at 0 – 0. 1 m depth, whereas addition of short-range-ordered Fe oxides had no effect. Cultivable Fe-reducing bacterial abundance was four orders of magnitude greater in surface soil (0 – 0. 1 m) than below 1 m. Although cultivable Fe oxidizing bacteria were typically also more abundant in surface soil, addition of labile C and nitrate stimulated Fe oxidizers in deep soil by two orders of magnitude under anaerobic conditions. This implies that infiltration of nitrate (and possibly C) from shallow soil water could potentially promote biotic Fe oxidation, a critical step in bedrock weathering, 7 m below. Together, {{these data suggest that}} C, Fe, and nutrient availability increase microbial Fe {{reduction and}} oxidation in surface (vs deeper) soil microsites despite high bulk O 2, in contrast to the depth segregation of electron accepting processes often observed in aquatic ecosystems. Furthermore, the greatest capacity for Fe redox cycling can occur in A horizons that do not display gleying or mottling...|$|R
