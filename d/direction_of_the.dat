5|$|One torque {{generated}} by a tire, called the self aligning torque, is caused by asymmetries in the side-slip {{along the length of}} the contact patch. The resultant force of this side-slip occurs behind the geometric center of the contact patch, a distance described as the pneumatic trail, and so creates a torque on the tire. Since the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> side-slip is towards the outside of the turn, the force on the tire is towards the center of the turn. Therefore, this torque tends to turn the front wheel in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> side-slip, away from the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> turn, and therefore tends to increase the radius of the turn.|$|E

5|$|He {{explains}} that the assassin was not hired to kill Warren St. Claire, but to kill the bodyguard instead. When Vasquez had discovered that Lloyd was embezzling campaign funds, he approached the bodyguard about murdering Vasquez. As the bodyguard refused {{to carry out the}} murder, Lloyd had him killed. To prove his theory, Monk shows a photograph of Lloyd looking at the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shooter just after the shots were fired. Monk proves that Lloyd's sight line was obstructed, and that the gunshot's echo would have masked the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shot. As such, it was impossible that Lloyd could have known where the shots were coming from unless he already knew where the gunman would be.|$|E
