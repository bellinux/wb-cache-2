He wrote of the house to Henry van de Velde: [...] "I’m living in a beautiful old Grisons house with a <b>kitchen</b> <b>that</b> looks like Rembrandt’s studio". Kirchner overcame his illness and, although he was still dependent on morphine, his doctor was slowly decreasing his doses. He also writes [...] "A Painter's Credo" [...] where he states: [...] "There is an intellectual guardianship over the world, it is man…. This is the last judgement, before them you stand…..

40|$|India’s {{economic}} growth is contributing to a massive increase in the generation of solid waste. Approximately 55 million tones of Municipal Solid Waste is generated annually by urban areas in India. Over 59 % of homes in urban India use Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) supplied in portable cylinders for their cooking needs. However, due to our country’s dwindling petroleum reserves and increased costly imports of petroleum, non conventional energy resources are slowly gaining importance. The use of biogas using kitchen waste as feedstock can help {{solve the problem of}} energy deficit and at the same time, allow the safe disposal of kitchen waste which is often unscientifically dumped or discarded. Our institute campus (Bhavans’ campus) has a number of campus <b>kitchens</b> <b>that</b> utilize several LPG cylinders and also generate large amounts of kitchen waste. The kitchen waste generated has high calorific value and moisture content; hence it can be anaerobically digested. The biogas produced can be used to supplement the fuel requirements of the campus <b>kitchens</b> <b>that</b> generate the <b>kitchen</b> waste. This study consists of carrying out survey, characterization of kitchen waste from several kitchens and exploring it’s potential to be used for biogas production...|$|R
