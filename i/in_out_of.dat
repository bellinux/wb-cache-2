5|$|For decades Salford's {{economy was}} heavily {{dependent}} on manufacturing industry, especially textiles and engineering. Since the Second World War however, Salford has experienced decades of growing unemployment as these sectors diminished and new sectors chose to locate <b>in</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> town locations with better transport links. Between 1965 and 1991 the city lost over 49,000jobs, or more than 32% of its employment base. Several factors contributed to this decline, not least changes in the national and international economies, {{the introduction of new}} technology and the concentration of investment in London and South East England. The biggest job losses were experienced in Salford's traditional industries and although the service sector expanded during this period, it was unable to compensate for the decline in manufacturing.|$|E

5|$|Towers {{scored the}} first Welsh try, which was {{converted}} by Jim Webb. The Natives {{replied with a}} spirited run by Ellison, but he failed {{to break through the}} Welsh defence. The tourists trailed even further after George Thomas scored a breakaway try frrm the half-way line, which went some way to silence the heckles from the crowd. Webb, playing <b>in</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> position at full-back, missed the conversion and then failed at a long distance goal from a mark. The Natives continued to push, with Elliot coming within five-yards of the try line, and when Ellison did manage to cross the line he was carried back into the 25-yard line before he could touch down. In the second half Wales continued to push their advantage when Alexander Bland dribbled the ball into the Natives' 25; this was collected by Sydney Nicholls, who managed to get the ball across the try line, allowing Jim Hannan to score. Warbrick for the Natives and Stadden for Wales both subsequently came close to scoring tries, but there were no further scores in the game.|$|E
5|$|Andrei and Daniil {{are working}} on the {{decoration}} of a church in Vladimir. Although they have been there for several months the walls are still white and bare as Andrei is doubting himself. A messenger arrives with word from the furious Bishop to say they have until the Autumn to finish the job. On a nearby road {{in the middle of a}} field of flowers Andrei confides to Daniil that the task disgusts him and that he is unable to paint a subject such as the Last Judgement as he doesn’t want to terrify people into submission. He comes to the conclusion that he has lost the ease of mind that an artist needs for his work. Foma, impatient and ambitious, resigns and leaves Andrei's group to take up the offer of painting a smaller, less prestigious, church. Stone carvers and decorators of Andrei's party have also been working on the Grand Prince's mansion. The Prince wants the work to be done again more in line with his tastes but the workers already have another job, at the mansion of the Grand Prince's brother, and refuse. On a path through the woods soldiers accost the artisans on the orders of the Grand Prince and gouge their eyes out, so that they cannot replicate their work. Back at the church Andrei is dismayed by the news of their fate and angrily throws paint and smears it on one of the walls. Sergei (Vladimir Titov) one of the young apprentices who escaped the attack unharmed reads a random section of the bible aloud, at Daniil's request, concerning women. Durochka (Irma Raush) (whose name identifies her as a holy fool or Yurodivy), wanders <b>in</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the rain and is upset by the sight of the paint on the wall. Her feeble-mindedness and innocence leads Andrei to the idea to paint a feast.|$|E

40|$|Optimum {{conditions}} for image quality contrast were studied with phantom method {{by means of}} MRI system (of constant conduction type; 0. 1 -T) in order to detect tumor lesions of liver that show no distinct contrast by usual roentgeno-graphic methods. Signal intensity of liver, fat and muscle were maximally suppressed at 1000 ms of TR and 100 ms of TI by the short inversion time inversion recovery (STIR) method, resulting in distinct visualization of liver tumor with extremely good contrast. Clinical investigation with the usual T 1 - and T 2 - weighted images under the same conditions identified hepatocellular carcinoma <b>in</b> 22 <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 31 patients (37 of 58 nodules, 64 %), cholangiocellular carcinoma 3 of 5 (3 of 6 nodules, 50 %), metastatic liver cancer <b>in</b> 55 <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 68 (111 of 143 nodules, 78 %), hepatic hemangioma <b>in</b> 32 <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 36 (41 of 47 nodules, 87 %) and liver cyst <b>in</b> 8 <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 8 (100 %).
