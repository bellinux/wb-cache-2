The collected data from VLT and from observations during the microlensing event was run {{through a series of}} models and analyzed. An orbiting planetary body larger than Jupiter (or of a similar size, given uncertainties) was discovered. The discovery of the planet was reported on February 21, 2011 in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics.|$|E

5|$|Europa Clipper — In July 2013 {{an updated}} concept for a flyby Europa mission called Europa Clipper was {{presented}} by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL). In May 2015, NASA announced that it had accepted development of the Europa Clipper mission, and revealed the instruments it will use. The aim of Europa Clipper is to explore Europa in order to investigate its habitability, and to aid selecting sites for a future lander. The Europa Clipper would not orbit Europa, but instead orbit Jupiter and conduct 45 low-altitude flybys of Europa during its envisioned mission. The probe would carry an ice-penetrating radar, short-wave infrared spectrometer, topographical <b>imager,</b> and an ion- and neutral-mass spectrometer.|$|E
40|$|Like odor perception, odor {{imagery is}} {{characterized}} by wide variability between individuals. The present two-part study sought to assess whether this inter-individual variability is underlain by behavioral differences in actual odor perception. In study 1, subjects judged the intensity, pleasantness, familiarity and edibility of 3 odorants. Participants were split into two olfactory imagery groups ("good" versus "poor" olfactory <b>imagers)</b> according to their scores on an imagery questionnaire. Results showed that good olfactory <b>imagers</b> judged all odors as more familiar and more edible than did poor olfactory <b>imagers.</b> Study 2 sought to determine whether these effects derived from a particular strategy of reenacting olfactomotor responses to smells {{on the part of}} good olfactory <b>imagers,</b> by recording their sniffs during odor perception. Results revealed that good olfactory <b>imagers</b> sniffed all odors longer and, again, judged these same odors as more edible and familiar. This supports the hypothesis of more complete odor processing and better access to odor semantics in good olfactory <b>imagers...</b>|$|R

In the late 1970 s, radar became a standard component in space-borne remote sensing systems. Radar <b>imagers</b> are especially useful for space-borne and airborne applications because in the microwave frequency band, they operate independent of atmospheric conditions like clouds, rain, snow, fog, daylight, etc. unlike optical <b>imagers.</b> Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems are radar <b>imagers</b> that exploit the collection of many independent samples of targets in a particular scene to produce intrinsically highresolution images and have several key advantages over airborne optical <b>imagers...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} recent applications by Sandia National Laboratories of cooled and uncooled {{thermal infrared}} <b>imagers</b> to wide-area security assessment systems. Thermal <b>imagers</b> can solve many security assessment {{problems associated with}} the protection of high-value assets at military bases, secure installations, and commercial facilities. Thermal <b>imagers</b> can provide surveillance video from security areas or perimeters both day and night without expensive security lighting. Until fairly recently, thermal <b>imagers</b> required open-loop cryogenic cooling to operate. The high cost of these systems and associated maintenance requirements restricted their widespread use. However, recent developments in reliable, closed-loop, linear drive cryogenic coolers and uncooled infrared <b>imagers</b> have dramatically reduced maintenance requirements, extended MTBF, and are leading to reduced system cost. These technology developments are resulting in greater availability and practicality for military as well as civilian security applications...|$|R

3000|$|All these all-sky <b>imagers</b> were {{calibrated}} using {{facilities at}} NIPR, Japan, {{as has been}} done for other OMTIs <b>imagers.</b> Details of the calibration procedures were shown by Shiokawa et al. (2000). The sensitivities shown in Table  2 are mostly 0.2 – 0.6 counts/R/s {{at the center of}} the images. The <b>imagers</b> developed by PWING (<b>imagers</b> # 16 – 21) have better sensitivities than those of previous OMTIs <b>imagers</b> (<b>imagers</b> # 7 and # 14 in Table  2 and those in Shiokawa et al. 1999, 2009 a). This is mainly because of the increase of sensitivities of the CCD detectors. The sensitivity of 0.5 counts/R/s can give 600 counts for 10 R emissions with a 30  s exposure and a 2  ×  2 binning (=  0.5  ×  10 R ×  30  s ×  2  ×  2). The readout noise of the CCD camera is six electrons r.m.s. which is much smaller than the airglow counts. For Hamamatsu cooled CCD camera (C 11090 - 22 B), the 1 count corresponds to 1.26 electrons in the slow scan mode. The 600 counts with a signal-to-noise ratio S/N [...]...|$|R
40|$|The {{changing}} healthcare environment presents {{many challenges}} to cardiovascular <b>imagers.</b> This perspective paper uses current trends to propose strategies that cardiovascular <b>imagers</b> can follow to lead in managing change and developing the imaging laboratory of the future. In {{the area of}} quality, <b>imagers</b> are encouraged to follow guidelines and standards, implement structured reporting and laboratory databases, adopt ongoing quality improvement programs, and use benchmarks to confirm imaging quality. In the area of access, <b>imagers</b> are encouraged to enhance availability of testing, focus on patient and referring physician value and satisfaction, collaboratively implement new technologies and uses of imaging, integrate health information technology in the laboratory, and work toward the appropriate inclusion of imaging in new healthcare delivery models. In the area of cost, <b>imagers</b> are encouraged to minimize laboratory operating expenses without compromising quality, and {{to take an active}} role in care redesign initiatives to ensure that imaging is utilized appropriately and at proper time intervals. <b>Imagers</b> are also encouraged to learn leadership and management skills, undertake strategic planning exercises, and build strong, collaborative teams. Although it is difficult to predict the future of cardiovascular imaging delivery, a reasonable sense of the likely direction of many changes and careful attention to the fundamentals of good health care (quality, access, and cost) can help <b>imagers</b> to thrive now and in the future...|$|R

RESEARCH DESIGN ANDMETHODSdDiabetic patients in a primary care setting or specialty diabetes clinic received Joslin Vision Network protocol retinal imaging as part of their care. Trained nonphysician <b>imagers</b> graded the presence versus absence of stDR at the time of imaging. These gradings were compared with masked gradings of certified readers. RESULTSdOf 158 patients (316 eyes) imaged, all cases of stDR (42 eyes [13 %]) were iden-tified by the <b>imagers</b> at the time of imaging. Six eyes with mild nonproliferative diabetic reti-nopathy were graded by the <b>imagers</b> to have stDR (sensitivity 1. 00, 95 %CI 0. 90 – 1. 00; specificity 0. 97, 0. 94 – 0. 99).

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates how {{sequential}} coherence in sentence pairs (events in sequence vs. unrelated events) affects the perceived ability {{to form a}} mental image of the sentences for both auditory and visual presentations. In addition, we investigated how the ease of event imagery affected online comprehension (word reading times) {{in the case of}} sequentially coherent and incoherent sentence pairs. Two groups of comprehenders were identified based on their self-reported ability to form vivid mental images of described events. Imageability ratings were higher and faster for pairs of sentences that described events in coherent sequences rather than non-sequential events, especially for high <b>imagers.</b> Furthermore, reading times on individual words suggested different comprehension patterns with respect to sequence coherence for the two groups of <b>imagers,</b> with high <b>imagers</b> activating richer mental images earlier than low <b>imagers.</b> The present results offer a novel link between research on imagery and discourse coherence, with specific contributions to our understanding of comprehension patterns for high and low <b>imagers...</b>|$|R
