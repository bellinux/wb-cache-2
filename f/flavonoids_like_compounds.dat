40|$|Many {{fruits of}} the Myrtaceae have a rich history of use both as edibles and as {{traditional}} medicines in divergent ethnobotanical practices throughout the tropical and subtropical world. From South America to Southeast Asia, these fruits {{have been used for}} a wide variety of ailments, including cough, diabetes, dysentery, inﬂammation and ringworm. These same fruits are also used to make many food products. Based on information regarding ethnomedical use, known phytochemistry, fruit color, popularity as edibles and availability, the fruits of several edible species from the subtribe Eugeniinae have been selected for phytochemical analysis in an attempt to discover new antioxidants. The fruits of six species in this group have shown a strong antioxidant activity in the 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhy-drazyl chemical assay. The UV absorbance spectrum of the most active compound in Eugenia uniflora L. indicates that it is a <b>ﬂavonoid.</b> Polyphenolic <b>compounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>ﬂavonoids</b> have an enormous range of biological activity and are known to inhibit oxidative damage in vivo better than the classical vitamin antioxidants. In plants, they protect against lipid peroxidation and UV damage that can affect tropical fruits growing under severe conditions including high heat and intense sunlight...|$|R
30|$|Antioxidant enzymes {{may have}} {{a major role in}} {{preventing}} male infertility due to oxidative stress since CCl 4 and reactive oxygen species are associated with impaired antioxidant enzyme status which determine in part the body’s antioxidant capacity [26]. Administration of CCl 4 decreased the levels of ascorbic acid, α-tocopherol, SOD, catalase, total glutathione and peroxidase while increasing the level of lipid peroxidation as measured by MDA. Reduction in the levels of antioxidant enzymes and vitamins is inversely related to the MDA suggesting the involvement of oxidative stress in the levels of these enzymes. Decreased glutathione levels may be due toxic effects of CCl 4 on NADP (H) enzyme which is the limiting factor in its production [37]. Catalase is known to convert peroxides especially hydrogen peroxide to water and in the circumstance of its lipid peroxides, this enzyme will be consumed leading to its low levels [38]. Treatment with P. tuber-regium improved the levels of the antioxidant enzymes and vitamins further leading credence to the antioxidant properties of this mushroom. Plants with polyphenolics <b>like</b> <b>flavonoids,</b> phenolic <b>compounds,</b> glucans are known to be effective in anti-oxidation. This they do by scavenging hydroxyl and superoxide radicals, chelate metal ions or exert synergistic effects in conjunction with other antioxidant metabolites [7].|$|R
40|$|Acidovorax radicis N 35 is a {{plant growth}} {{promoting}} endophytic bacterium in wheat and barley. The perception by plants {{can be characterized}} using RNAseq, q-PCR and selected metabolite analyses. It could be shown, that barley seedlings are quickly responding to bacterial colonization by a reprogramming of gene expression and priming of defense responses. Especially, the role of quorum sensing auto-inducers of the N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) type in the perception by plants should be analyzed. A. radicis N 35 produces 3 -hydroxy-C 10 -homoserine lactone (3 -OH-C 10 -HSL) as major AHL-compound. In this communication the influence of A. radicis N 35 -produced 3 -OH-C 10 -HSL on barley seedlings was investigated by comparing wild type and an araI insertion mutant, lacking AHL-production. The comparison of inoculation effects of the A. radicis N 35 wild type and the araI mutant discovered remarkable differences. While the N 35 wild type colonized plant roots effectively by forming biofilm-like structures on the root surface, the araI mutant occurred at the root surface as single cells. In addition, in a mixed inoculum of wild type and araI mutant, the wild type was predominant in colonization compared to the araI mutant. Nevertheless, a significant plant growth promotion effect could be shown after inoculation of barley with the wild type and the araI mutant in soil after 2 months. A. radicis N 35 wild type showed less induction of early defense responses in plant RNA-expression analysis, whereas the araI mutant caused e. g. increased expression of flavonoid biosynthesis genes, which was corroborated by the accumulation of several <b>flavonoid</b> <b>compounds</b> <b>like</b> saponarin and lutonarin in leaves of root inoculated barley seedlings. Thus, it can be concluded, that the synthesis of 3 -OH-C 10 -HSL by A. radicis has implications on the colonization efficiency of plant roots and the perception by the host plant barley...|$|R

Commercially used saffron is dried stigma which has been used for some of its physiologic properties for centuries.

The antioxidant activities are mainly attributed to their carotenoid and <b>flavonoid</b> <b>compounds,</b> <b>like</b> Crocin and Kaempferol. These bioactive compounds have important biological activities; cancer and prevention and treatment of heart, vascular disease. Crocin is a diester formed from the disaccharide gentiobiose and the dicarboxylic acid crocetin and is known to inhibit proliferation and nucleic acid synthesis. It induces apoptosis in the human tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line Tca 8113 and hepatocarcinoma. Kaempferol is a natural flavonoid. Numerous reports have shown that Kaempferol and/or Kaempferol glycosides induce cell death in a variety of cancer cells from different tissues. Many of these reports have shown that it is effective in reducing vascular endothelial growth factor expression in ovarian and colon cancer cells. Extraction of these antioxidants was carried out using methanol and ethanol in different concentrations for each compound. Isolation and purification, in comparison with authentic standards, was achieved by Flash Column Chromatography and Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC). Crocin and Kaempferol were chemically characterised by infrared (IR), mass spectroscopy (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H & 13 C NMR). The in-vitro cytotoxicity towards cancer cell lines will also be investigated.
