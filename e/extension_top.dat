40|$|Multi-stage {{optimization}} under uncertainty {{techniques can}} be used to solve long-term management problems. Although many optimization modeling language extensions as well as computational environments have been proposed, the acceptance of this technique is generally low, due to the inherent complexity of the modeling and solution process. In this paper a simplification to annotate multi-stage decision problems under uncertainty is presented - this simplification contrasts with the common approach to create an <b>extension</b> on <b>top</b> of an existing optimization modeling language. This leads to the definition of meta models, which can be instanced in various programming languages. An example using the statistical computing language R is shown...|$|R
40|$|Reverse faults in {{northern}} Chile have formed 20 - 300 m high scarps that contain open fractures which {{occur in a}} zone of 20 - 1600 m wide. Two-dimensional numerical models were used to explore the geometrical and mechanical parameters needed to produce extension within a bulk contractional regime. All of the mechanical models show the same structure as the field: a concentration of cracks predominantly at the top, {{rather than on the}} forelimbs of the scarps. In the field case extension begins as soon as a discrete scarp forms; with progressive shortening the scarp height increases producing a broadening of the zone in extension. The numerical models show that this broadening stabilizes when a maximum in the scarp height is reached. To produce concentration of the <b>extension</b> on <b>top</b> of the scarps, the reverse fault needs to be weak (phi similar to 10 degrees). The models suggest that distribution of this extensional zone depends on the cross-sectional geometry of the fault and on the location of the detachment at depth. The main mechanism that produces <b>extension</b> on the <b>top</b> of the reverse scarp is stretching of the topographic surface by folding of the hanging wall {{at the tip of the}} fault zone...|$|R

The point of view is that HOAS can be soundly and fruitfully regarded as a definitional <b>extension</b> on <b>top</b> of FOAS (First-Order Abstract Syntax). As such, HOAS is not only an encoding technique, but also a higher-order view of a first-order reality. A rich collection of concepts and proof principles is developed inside the standard mathematical universe to give technical life to this point of view. The exercise consists of a new proof of Strong Normalization for System F. HOAS makes our proof considerably more direct than previous proofs. The concepts and results presented here have been formalized in the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL...|$|R
