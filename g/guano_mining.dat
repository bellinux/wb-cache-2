5|$|First sighted by Europeans in 1606, {{claimed by}} the United Kingdom in 1868, {{and part of the}} Republic of Kiribati since the island nation's {{independence}} in 1979, Caroline Island has remained relatively untouched and {{is considered one of the}} world's most pristine tropical islands, despite <b>guano</b> <b>mining,</b> copra harvesting, and human habitation in the 19th and 20th centuries. It is home to one of the world's largest populations of the coconut crab and is an important breeding site for seabirds, most notably the sooty tern.|$|E
25|$|<b>Guano</b> <b>mining</b> {{changed the}} cave environments by {{lowering}} their humidity, which possibly made them inhospitable to bat colonies.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possible}} cause of decline of this subspecies is <b>guano</b> <b>mining</b> in Australia, which frequently involved changing {{the shapes of}} caves to make extraction easier.|$|E
50|$|The Bat Cave <b>guano</b> <b>mine,</b> {{located in}} the western Grand Canyon of Arizona at river mile 266, 800 ft above Lake Mead, was an unusual, {{expensive}} and noteworthy mining operation. The natural cave was a bat habitat and contained an accumulation of guano.|$|R

25|$|Natural {{resources}} include fish, guano, oil {{and natural}} gas. Economic activity has included commercial fishing, shipping, <b>guano</b> <b>mining,</b> oil and gas exploitation, and more recently, tourism. The Spratlys are located near several primary shipping lanes.|$|E
25|$|The island's {{circumstances}} {{changed in}} the mid-19th century when it became the site of commercial <b>guano</b> <b>mining</b> operations. Various companies were granted licenses to extract the bat and seagull guano (a valuable fertilizer and key strategic commodity {{for the production of}} gunpowder) from the island's caves. Mining continued until 1927.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{employment}} on St. Brandon in 1922 was agriculture, with a manager, assistant manager and 11 labourers. Only {{two young men}} were recorded as working as fishermen. Three men worked as carpenters, one as a mason, one as a shoemaker and another as a domestic servant. There was no indication that the <b>guano</b> <b>mines</b> were operating.|$|R
50|$|The {{largest of}} the three villages on Middle Caicos, Conch Bar {{is the home of}} the Island’s airport, its primary school and {{government}} offices. Nearby Conch Bar Caves National Park hosts the largest above-water cave system in the Bahamas. The karst limestone caves were used as a <b>guano</b> <b>mine</b> during the 1880s. Lucayan Indian artifacts and the skeletal remains of animals were reportedly uncovered by the digging, but were not preserved.|$|R
50|$|From 1910 through 1936 <b>guano</b> was <b>mined</b> on {{the island}} and about 150,000 tonnes were {{exported}} to New Zealand.|$|R
25|$|The United States took {{possession}} of the island in 1857, claiming it under the Guano Islands Act of 1856. Its guano deposits were mined by the American Guano Company from 1859 to 1878. As {{an example of the}} scale of the <b>guano</b> <b>mining</b> and its destination the following ship movements were reported in late 1868.|$|E
25|$|The first {{navigation}} light {{to actually be}} installed on Lady Elliot Island was installed two years later, in 1866, {{in connection with the}} <b>guano</b> <b>mining</b> company operating on the island which started in 1863. It was a temporary light installed on a tall mast, which survived until 1871 when it was destroyed by a gale and rebuilt.|$|E
25|$|By 1874 the <b>guano</b> <b>mining</b> on {{the island}} has ceased, and a second cottage was built soon after. The residences were to be rebuilt twice more. The first time was {{sometime}} in the 1900s. A second time was in 1925 where three new cottages were built {{as well as the}} boat shed and two more sheds for maintenance and storage.|$|E

500|$|After the United States {{joined the}} Allies, Yorktown {{operated}} {{off the coast}} of Mexico until August 1917, when she paused briefly at San Diego. On 18 July 1917, Yorktown rescued the last surviving members of an abandoned <b>guano</b> <b>mining</b> settlement on Clipperton Island. [...] From a peak population of roughly 100 in 1915, only four women and seven children survived. [...] After her time off the Mexican coast, Yorktown then cruised off the west coasts of Central and South America into 1918. After a refit at Mare Island, Yorktown, sailed for the east coast on 28 April 1918, transiting the Panama Canal en route, and arrived at New York on 20 August. The gunboat escorted a coastal convoy to Halifax, soon there after before returning to New York. She performed local coastwise escort duties through the end of World War I. After a period of upkeep at the New York Navy Yard in December, she departed the east coast on 2 January 1919 on her last voyage to California.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1880s and 1890s a {{large amount}} of {{material}} was recovered during <b>guano</b> <b>mining.</b> Items including bottles, coins, wine glasses, jars, pots, spoons, knives, musket and cannonballs, tobacco and pipes were found. Florance Broadhurst, son of entrepreneur [...] Charles Edward Broadhurst and director of the Broadhurst and McNeil phosphate company, catalogued the finds, initially thinking they were from the VOC ship [...] Batavia and ended up donating most to the Western Australian Museum in Perth.|$|E

5|$|Dr. No is {{the sixth}} novel by the English author Ian Fleming to feature his British Secret Service agent James Bond. Fleming wrote the novel in early 1957 at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica. It was first {{published}} in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape on 31 March 1958. The novel centres on Bond's investigation into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives. He establishes that they had been investigating Doctor No, a Chinese operator of a <b>guano</b> <b>mine</b> on the fictional Caribbean island of Crab Key. Bond travels to the island and meets Honeychile Rider and later Doctor No.|$|R
2500|$|In 1890, the Kingdom of Hawaii granted George D. Freeth and Charles N. Spencer {{permission}} to <b>mine</b> the <b>guano</b> on Laysan anyway, {{as long as}} they paid a royalty. This newfound attention to Laysan attracted scientists, and in the next decade, many of Laysan's unique species were scientifically examined for the first time.

2500|$|The island {{presently}} {{serves as}} a retreat for Puerto Ricans and nature enthusiasts {{from all around the}} world, and has also become a popular destination for Puerto Rican Boy and Girl Scouts. Due to the islands' unique topography, ecology and location, Mona, Desecheo and Monito have been nicknamed [...] "The Galápagos Islands of the Caribbean". Scientists, ecologists, and students have visited Mona Island to explore its distinct ecosystem, which includes the endemic Mona Ground Iguana. The island is also home to many cave drawings that were left behind by the island's original inhabitants. Remains of the <b>guano</b> <b>mining</b> industry can also be seen.|$|E
2500|$|Lechuguilla Cave is {{well known}} for its {{delicate}} speleothems and pristine underground environment. <b>Guano</b> <b>mining</b> occurred in the pit below the entrance in the 1910s.

Over [...] of cave passage has been explored and mapped. It has been mapped to a depth of , making it the second deepest limestone cave in the U.S. To protect the fragile environment, access is limited to permitted scientific expeditions only.|$|E
2500|$|In 1872 {{plans were}} drawn {{for a new}} lighthouse, and tenders were called. The winning tender, for £749, was by the {{brothers}} John and Jacob Rooney of Maryborough, which also constructed Sandy Cape Light, Cowan Cowan Point Light, Cape Capricorn Light, Cape Bowling Green Light and Booby Island Light. The lighthouse was established in 1873, the third to be erected in Queensland since its formation in 1959, following Bustard Head Light in 1869 and Sandy Cape Light in 1870. By then, the <b>guano</b> <b>mining</b> operation has almost completely cleared the vegetation on the island. This was made worse by a herd of goats which were imported for meat and milk, which ate all growing vegetation. As the island had little topographical features to offer protection to begin with, so the station was completely unprotected from the powers of nature.|$|E
50|$|A site on {{the bluffs}} just north of Fults, {{overlooking}} the Bottoms is known as Saltpetre Cave and took {{its name from the}} quantities of bat <b>guano</b> <b>mined</b> there for potassium nitrate which was used in the local manufacture of black powder by the French at Fort de Chartres and later inhabitants. This cave, cut {{into the side of the}} bluffs, and an excellent defensive position, was one of the last refuges for Native Americans in the region. It was a popular site in the area for rappelling and hiking, until access to it was restricted in the aftermath of the Great Flood of 1993 and several accidents at the site.|$|R

50|$|The St. Brandon {{archipelago}} was {{surveyed by}} British colonial authorities on 31 March 1911 {{as part of}} the Census of Mauritius. This found a total population of 110, made up of 97 men (86 non-Indian and 11 Indian) and 13 women (10 non-Indian and 3 Indian). While the archipelago likely had a resident population at this point, as indicated by the 8 {{children under the age of}} 15 and the 5 people over the age of 60, there was also likely a seasonal component, with the largest population segment being men between 20 and 35. 73 men worked in fishing, 11 at the <b>guano</b> <b>mines</b> and 4 were ship's carpenters. Only one (male) person was recorded as having been born on St. Brandon.|$|R
2500|$|In November 1802, Alexander von Humboldt was {{the first}} European to [...] {{encounter}} guano and began investigating its fertilizing properties at Callao in Peru, and his subsequent writings on this topic made the subject well known in Europe. During the guano boom of the nineteenth century, {{the vast majority of}} seabird guano was harvested from Peruvian guano islands, but large quantities were also exported from the Caribbean, atolls in the Central Pacific, and islands off the coast of Namibia, Oman, Patagonia, and Baja California. At that time, massive deposits of guano existed on some islands, in some cases more than 50 m deep. In this context the United States passed the Guano Islands Act in 1856, which gave U.S. citizens discovering a source of guano on an unclaimed island exclusive rights to the deposits. Nine of these islands are still officially U.S. territories. Control over guano {{played a central role in}} the Chincha Islands War (1864–1866) between Spain and a Peruvian-Chilean alliance. Indentured workers from China played an important role in guano harvest. The first group of 79 Chinese workers arrived in Peru in 1849; by the time that trade ended a quarter of a century later, over 100,000 of their fellow countrymen had been imported. There is no documentary evidence that enslaved Pacific Islanders participated in <b>guano</b> <b>mining.</b> [...] Between 1847 and 1873, there was a significant increase in Peruvian guano exports, and the revenue from this momentarily ended the fiscal necessity of the colonial head tax.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{specific}} set of contracts, negotiating parties must conduct themselves in utmost good faith (or [...] "uberrima fides") by disclosing all material facts to one another. In one of the earliest cases, Carter v Boehm, Mr Carter bought an insurance policy for any losses to a naval fort of the British East India Company in Sumatra, but failed to tell his insurer, Boehm, that the fort was only built to resist attacks from locals, and the French were likely to invade. Lord Mansfield held the policy was invalid. Since insurance is a contract based on speculation and the special facts [...] "lie most commonly in the knowledge of the insured only", good faith precluded Mr Carter [...] "concealing what he privately knows". The same policy was extended for sale of shares in a company. So in Erlanger v New Sombrero Phosphate Co the promoter and director-to-be of a <b>guano</b> <b>mining</b> business failed to disclose he had paid for the mining rights on the island of Sombrero half as much as he subsequently was valuing the company at. The House of Lords held that, despite a delay in making a claim, the purchasers of the shares had a right to their money back. Lord Blackburn held, further, that it was no barrier to rescission that the guano could not be put back in the ground. Counter-restitution (i.e. both parties giving back what they had got), if it could be substantially made in its monetary equivalent, was enough. However, outside insurance, partnerships, surety, fiduciary relations, company shares, a narrow range of regulated securities, and consumer credit agreements, the duty on negotiating parties to disclose material facts does not extend to most contracts. Even though there is a duty to correct previous false statements, in Smith v Hughes, it was held that the general duty is merely to not make active misrepresentations.|$|E
50|$|Houlder Brothers and Co., {{under the}} {{management}} of Arundel, also conducted minimal <b>guano</b> <b>mining</b> on the island from 1874.

5|$|After {{recovering}} from serious poisoning inflicted by the SMERSH agent Rosa Klebb (in From Russia, with Love) the MI6 agent James Bond is sent by his superior, M, on an undemanding {{mission to the}} British colony of Jamaica. He is instructed to investigate the disappearance of Commander John Strangways, the head of MI6's Station J in Kingston, and his secretary. Bond is briefed that Strangways had been investigating the activities of Doctor Julius No, a reclusive Chinese-German who lives on the fictional island of Crab Key and runs a <b>guano</b> <b>mine.</b> The island has a colony of roseate spoonbills at one end while local rumour is that a vicious dragon also lives there. The spoonbills are protected by the American National Audubon Society, two of whose representatives died when their plane crashed on No's airstrip.|$|R
