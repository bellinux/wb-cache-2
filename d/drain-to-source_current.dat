40|$|Graduation date: 2006 The {{primary focus}} of this thesis {{involves}} modeling and development of p-type thin-film transistors (p-TFTs), moving towards the realization of a filly transparent thin-film transistor (TTFT). The modeling portion of this thesis emphasizes the development of physics-based TFT models, specifically focusing on the elucidation of non-ideal current-voltage characteristic behavior. A 3 -layer model is introduced, which includes three current paths from source to drain via an insulator/semiconductor accumulation layer, a bulk conduction path, and a surface conduction path. In addition, series resistance is incorporated into the 3 -layer model to account for non-ideal source/drain metal-semiconductor contacts, yielding a non-analytical model which is solved iteratively. In addition to TFT model development, field-effect, effective, average, and incremental mobility trends are simulated. The development portion of this thesis {{is devoted to the}} design, fabrication, and testing of p-type TFTs with BaCuSF channel layers. All of the p-type TFTs fabricated to date exhibit non-idealities in the form of high output conductance and the inability for the <b>drain-to-source</b> <b>current</b> to be shut off. It is concluded that the cause of these problems is a high hole carrier concentration in the BaCuSF channel that results in a large amount of <b>drain-to-source</b> <b>current</b> being shunted through the bulk of the semiconductor.

Here, we experimentally demonstrate the steep switching behavior of a MOS devicethat is, SS ∼ 18 mV/decade (much less than 60 mV/decade) at 300 Kby taking advantage of negative capacitance in a MOS gate stack. This negative capacitance, originating from the dynamics of the stored energy in a phase transition of a ferroelectric material, can achieve the step-up conversion of internal voltage (i. e., internal voltage amplification in a MOS device).

Application of forward gate bias narrows the depletion regions, opening up the channel to conduction by majority carriers.

Three-dimensional (3 D) device structure, i.e., fin-shaped FET (FinFET), has been adopted for implementing 10  nm-scale technology platform in industry [2]. Although the scaling of semiconductor device has been successfully achieved, the electric field intensity in device (e.g., in the channel region of device) has been hardly controlled (i.e., the electric field has not been constant but increasing every new technology generation). Thereby, the miniaturization of device such as MOSFET and FinFET has evenetually soared up the power density per unit area of IC chip. As of now, many groups have put an emphasis on addressing the technical issue (i.e., the power crisis in IC chip).
