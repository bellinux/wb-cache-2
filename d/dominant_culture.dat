5|$|Several of {{the founders}} of the American Indian Movement, {{including}} Clyde Bellecourt, Vernon Bellecourt, Dennis Banks and Russel Means, were among the first to protest names and mascots such as the Washington Redskins and Chief Wahoo. Vernon Bellecourt also founded the National Coalition Against Racism in Sports and Media (NCARSM) in 1989. Cornel Pewewardy (Comanche-Kiowa), Professor and Director of Indigenous Nations Studies at Portland State University, cites indigenous mascots as an example of dysconscious racism which, by placing images of Native American or First Nations people into an invented media context, continues to maintain the superiority of the <b>dominant</b> <b>culture.</b> Such practices can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism or neocolonialism.|$|E

25|$|Singapore {{has never}} had a <b>dominant</b> <b>culture</b> to which {{immigrants}} could assimilate even though Malay was the dominant language at that time. Together with efforts from the government and ruling party, Lee tried to create a unique Singaporean identity in the 1970s and 1980s—one which heavily recognised racial consciousness within the umbrella of multiculturalism.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} the house is built of stone to begin with is {{culturally}} significant. Dutch colonists in the Province of New York had lived under English rule {{since the end of}} the Third Anglo-Dutch War in 1674, but they resisted assimilation by the newly <b>dominant</b> <b>culture,</b> often speaking Dutch as their first language and building stone houses in accordance with their native building traditions throughout much of the 18th century, including a period after American independence.|$|E
25|$|Pygmies {{are often}} evicted from {{their land and}} given the lowest paying jobs. At a state level, Pygmies are not {{considered}} citizens by most African states and are refused identity cards, deeds to land, health care and proper schooling. Government policies and multinational corporations involved in massive deforestation have exacerbated this problem by forcing more Pygmies out of their traditional homelands and into villages and cities where they often are marginalized, impoverished and abused by the <b>dominant</b> <b>culture.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Sami {{have for}} centuries {{been the subject}} of {{discrimination}} and abuse by the <b>dominant</b> <b>cultures</b> claiming possession of their lands right unto the present day.

50|$|This {{also brings}} clarity to {{differences}} observed in modern human brains between environments. In areas of prosperity, where warmth, food, and basic needs for survival are abundant RHS domination is prevalent. Unsurprisingly, {{in areas of}} scarcity where cold and limited food are concerns LHS domination is prevalent. This phenomenon has been recorded numerous times when examining LHS <b>dominant</b> <b>cultures,</b> {{such as those of}} the Arctic, to RHS <b>dominant</b> <b>cultures,</b> like Africa. Similarly, studies of animals such as the Chickadee have shown similar results. Yukon born chickadees have LHS dominance as compared to Texas born chickadees with RHS dominance. In exchanging Yukon borns for Texas borns it was shown that the action reliant Yukon birds consistently became the alpha of their new environment whereas inaction reliant Texan birds died shortly after their arrival in the Yukon.|$|R

25|$|The first {{indigenous}} group {{encountered by}} Columbus, the 250,000 Taínos of Hispaniola, represented the <b>dominant</b> <b>culture</b> in the Greater Antilles and the Bahamas. Within thirty years about 70% of the Taínos had died. They had no immunity to European diseases, so outbreaks of measles and smallpox ravaged their population. Increasing punishment of the Taínos for revolting against forced labour, despite measures {{put in place}} by the encomienda, which included religious education and protection from warring tribes, eventually led to the last great Taíno rebellion (1511–1529).|$|E
25|$|Feminist {{science fiction}} {{is focused on}} {{theories}} that include {{but are not limited}} to gender inequality, sexuality, race, economics, and reproduction. Feminist SF is political because of its tendency to critique the <b>dominant</b> <b>culture.</b> Some of the most notable feminist science fiction works have illustrated these themes using utopias to explore a society in which gender differences or gender power imbalances do not exist, or dystopias to explore worlds in which gender inequalities are intensified, thus asserting a need for feminist work to continue.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{theories}} regarding {{the beginning of}} the Ethiopian civilisation. One theory, which is more widely accepted today locates its origins in Punt, while acknowledging the influence of the Sabeans {{on the opposite side of}} the Red Sea. At a later period, Ethiopian civilisation was exposed to Judaic influence, of which the best-known examples are the Qemant and Ethiopian Jews (or Beta Israel) ethnic groups, but Judaic customs, terminology, and beliefs can be found amongst the <b>dominant</b> <b>culture</b> of the Amhara and Tigrinya. Indian alphabets have been claimed as the example used to create the vowel system of the Ge'ez abugida.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} about cultural interactions during the Zhou period of China (c. a. 1000 - 350 B. C.) between the Suizao corridor (near the present-day Yangtze River region) and its contemporaries within {{or outside the}} Zhou realm. It mainly, but not exclusively, concentrates on bronze ritual vessels from the Suizao corridor, and discusses the underlying social and political relations between the <b>dominant</b> <b>cultures</b> and the regional ones in this particular area (the Zeng state for example), which are central to understanding {{the ways in which}} the <b>dominant</b> <b>cultures</b> joined their disparate territories into a whole. Newly excavated archaeological evidence show that there were at least three periods when people in the Suizao corridor learned about the current traditions employed elsewhere, which are: 1) Yejiashan period (from the 11 th to 10 th century B. C.); 2) post-Ritual Reform period (from the mid- 9 th to mid- 7 th century B. C.); and 3) Marquis Yiâs period (from the mid- 6 th to mid- 4 th century B. C.). In these periods, local people in the Suizao corridor were involved in networks of enormous and constantly changing complexity, in which people, objects, practices, and ideas were mixed together through interregional contacts. The choices of local people in adopting foreign materials and ideas from either the <b>dominant</b> <b>cultures</b> or other places heavily depended on the subjective view of their social identity, which can be constructed, maintained, or transited to adapt to different social and political environments. </p...|$|R
25|$|After a few centuries, {{the first}} {{settlement}} was abandoned. After the PPNA settlement phase, {{there was a}} settlement hiatus of several centuries, then the PPNB settlement was founded on the eroded surface of the tell. This second settlement, established in 6800 BC, perhaps represents {{the work of an}} invading people who absorbed the original inhabitants into their <b>dominant</b> <b>culture.</b> Artifacts dating from this period include ten plastered human skulls, painted so as to reconstitute the individuals' features. These represent either teraphim or the first example of portraiture in art history, and it is thought that they were kept in people's homes while the bodies were buried.|$|E
25|$|This {{pursuit of}} freedom {{was largely a}} {{reaction}} against conservative values entrenched within the rigid heroic couplet. Within a <b>dominant</b> <b>culture</b> that stressed elegance and finish, he granted primacy to freedom, breadth and imaginative suggestiveness, eventually developed into the romantic vision of sublime terror. Reaction to Milton's poetic worldview included, grudgingly, acknowledgement that of poet's resemblance to classical writers (Greek and Roman poetry being unrhymed). Blank verse came to be a recognised medium for religious works and for translations of the classics. Unrhymed lyrics like Collins' Ode to Evening (in the meter of Milton's translation of Horace's Ode to Pyrrha) were not uncommon after 1740.|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{agree that}} Díaz was never sympathetic to all Indians. In fact, {{he stated that}} the Yaquis and the Mayas {{had always been a}} pest for Mexico and that they needed to be dealt with. This {{is not to say that}} Díaz loved the rest of Mexico’s Indians. Perhaps, it could be argued that Díaz’s ultimate drive was that of economic expansion. Once Díaz amassed absolute legislative power, his indigenismo went out of the picture. It was not so much about elevating the lower classes into modern society and thus integrating them, but more about the economic and power status of the nation. After all, Indians composed less than half of Mexico’s population and their unwillingness to participate in the <b>dominant</b> <b>culture</b> made them political enemies of the state, especially those who persistently refused assimilation like the Yaqui and the Maya.|$|E

25|$|During the Spanish inquisition, a {{systematic}} conversion of Jews to Christianity took place to avoid expulsion from the kingdoms of Castille and Aragon {{as had been}} the case previously elswhere in medieval Europe. Although {{the vast majority of}} conversos simply assimilated into the Catholic <b>dominant</b> <b>culture,</b> a minority continued to practice Judaism in secret, gradually migrated throughout Europe, North Africa, and the Ottoman Empire, mainly to areas where Sephardic communities were already present {{as a result of the}} Alhambra Decree. Tens of thousands of Jews were baptised in the three months before the deadline for expulsion, some 40,000 if one accepts the totals given by Kamen, most of these undoubtedly to avoid expulsion, rather than as a sincere change of faith. These conversos were the principal concern of the Inquisition; being suspected of continuing to practice Judaism put them at risk of denunciation and trial.|$|E
25|$|In 1600, the Delaware / Lenape Native American {{population}} in the surrounding area may have numbered as many as 20,000. Several wars, at least 14 separate epidemics (yellow fever, small pox, influenza, encephalitis lethargica, etc.) and disastrous over-harvesting of the animal populations reduced their population to around 4,000 by the year 1700. Since the Lenape people, like all Native Americans, had no immunity to European diseases, when the populations contacted the epidemics, they frequently proved fatal. Some Lenape starved to death {{as a result of}} animal over-harvesting, while others were forced to trade their land for goods such as clothing and food. They were eventually moved to reservations set up by the US Government. They were first moved to the only Indian Reservation in New Jersey, the Brotherton Reservation in Burlington County, New Jersey (1758-1802). Those who remained survived through attempting to adapt to the <b>dominant</b> <b>culture,</b> becoming farmers and tradesmen. As the Lenni Lenape population declined, and the European {{population in}}creased, the history of the area was increasingly defined by the new European inhabitants and the Lenape Native American tribes played an increasingly secondary role.|$|E
25|$|After the Arab Muslim {{conquest of}} Persia, Middle Persian, the {{language}} of Sassanids, continued in wide use well into the second Islamic century (eighth century) as a medium of administration in the eastern lands of the Caliphate. Despite Arabization of public affairs, the peoples retained much of their pre-Islamic outlook and way of life, adjusted to fit {{the demands of the}} Islamic religion. Towards {{the end of the first}} Islamic century, population began resenting the cost of sustaining the Arab Caliphs, the Umayyads - who become oppressive and corrupt, and in the second Islamic century (eighth century AD), a generally Persian-led uprising - led by the Iranian national hero Abu Muslim Khorasani - brought another Arab clan, the Abbasids, to the Caliphal throne. Under the Abbasids, the Persianate customs of their Barmakid viziers became the style of the ruling elite. Politically, the Abbasids soon started losing their control, causing two major and lasting consequences. First, the Abbasid Caliph al-Mutasim (833-842) greatly increased the presence of Turkic mercenaries and Mamluk slaves in the Caliphate, and they eventually displaced Arabs and Persians from the military, and therefore from the political hegemony, starting an era of Turco-Persian symbiosis. Second, the governors in Khurasan, Tahirids, were factually independent; then the Saffarids from Sistan freed the eastern lands, but were replaced by independent Samanids, although they showed perfunctory deference to the Caliph. Separation of the eastern lands from Caliphate was expressed in a distinctive Persianate culture that became a <b>dominant</b> <b>culture</b> in West, Central and South Asia, and the source of innovations elsewhere in the Islamic world. This culture would persist, at least in the modified form of the Ottoman Empire, into the twentieth century. The Persianate culture was marked by the use of the new Persian language as a medium of administration and literature, by the rise of Persianized Turks to military control, by new political importance of non-Arab ulama, and by development of ethnically composite Islamic society.|$|E
