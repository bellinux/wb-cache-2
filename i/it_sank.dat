5|$|The {{story of}} Deng's order to ram the Yoshino and his {{subsequent}} refusal {{to leave his}} ship as <b>it</b> <b>sank</b> has resulted in him being placed in popular culture as a national hero, particularly following {{the formation of the}} People's Republic of China. Deng, and the events on the Zhuyuan are repeated in school textbooks in China, where they praise his actions while also criticising Li Hongzhang. The People's Liberation Army Navy training ship Shichang, was named after Deng.|$|E
5|$|U-21 was {{launched}} on 15 August 1916, {{the first of}} the four U-20-class boats. During a diving trial in January 1917, the submarine was damaged when <b>it</b> <b>sank</b> too deep, requiring repairs that took place over the next seven months. U-21 was commissioned on 15 August under the command of Linienschiffsleutnant Hugo von Seyffertitz. A 31-year-old native of Brixen, von Seyffertitz was a first-time U-boat commander.|$|E

5|$|U-28s second war patrol {{took place}} from 8 November to 12 December 1939. For this effort she was {{instructed}} to lay a minefield near {{the port city of}} Swansea. En route to Bristol, U-28 sank two ships; the 5,000ton Dutch tanker MV Sliedrecht and the 5,100ton British freighter SS Royston Grange. U-28 then laid her minefield and returned to port in Germany. While the minefield was not an immediate success, <b>it</b> <b>sank</b> the 9,600ton British freighter SS Protesilaus 60 days after it was laid.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, only two of the ships had been commissioned, with the third being brought into service three months after the war started. Their only significant pre-war task was undertaken by Beograd in May 1939, and involved the transportation of a large portion of Yugoslavia's gold reserve to the United Kingdom for safekeeping. On 24 January 1940, Ljubljana ran into a reef off the Yugoslav port of Šibenik. The hull side was breached and despite efforts to get the ship into the port, <b>it</b> <b>sank</b> close to shore, and some of the crew swam to safety. One crew member died, and the captain was arrested pending an investigation.|$|E
5|$|Berkshire No. 7 is a {{wood and}} steel barge {{constructed}} in 1935. It is historically {{important as a}} transitional canal barge and {{as one of the}} few surviving wooden-hulled canal boats. It was used to transport bulk cargo, including shipping fertilizer, from Connecticut to Long Island Sound. <b>It</b> <b>sank</b> in 1974 along with the Elmer S. Dailey and the Priscilla Dailey in the harbor of Bridgeport, Connecticut on the west side of the Pequonnock River. The sunken vessel has deteriorated to the point that a salvage operation could result in breaking it apart. The Berkshire No. 7 was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 21, 1978.|$|E

5|$|In 1545, from Southsea Castle, he {{witnessed}} his flagship Mary Rose sink {{with the loss}} of about 500 lives, whilst going into action against the French fleet in the Battle of the Solent. Some historians believe that the Mary Rose turned too quickly and submerged her open gun ports, whereas others argue that <b>it</b> <b>sank</b> due to its poor design. Over the years, Portsmouth's fortifications were rebuilt and improved by successive monarchs. In 1563, Portsmouth suffered from an outbreak of a plague, resulting in about 300 deaths out of the town's population of 2000.|$|E
5|$|The Berkshire No. 7 has {{historical}} importance {{because of}} its design, which reflects the construction of 19th-century canal boats. However, {{there is no record}} that the barge was ever used on a canal. The barge is one of two surviving wooden-hulled canal boats in existence. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 21, 1978. Its nomination and listing is unusual because the Berkshire No. 7 was not yet 50 {{years old at the time}} of its nomination, and <b>it</b> <b>sank</b> in 1974. It and the other two barges that sank with it are the only shipwrecks in Connecticut listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{her arrival}} at New Orleans on 6 July, Chickasaw was decommissioned. She {{temporarily}} bore the name Samson between 15 June and 10 August 1869 before resuming her original name. She was sold on 12 September 1874 to the New Orleans Pacific Railway Company who modified the ship into a coal barge {{with the name}} of Samson. The railroad converted the ship into a train ferry in 1880 and changed her to side-wheel propulsion under the name Gouldsboro. She was sold in the 1940s to the New Orleans Coal & Bisso Towboat Co. and converted into a work barge. <b>It</b> <b>sank</b> off the Greenville Bend of the Mississippi River in New Orleans sometime during the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|While the {{majority}} of the 2/3rd Battalion was successfully evacuated to Egypt, a small force of 141 men were evacuated to the island of Crete instead, after the transport ship they were on was sunk. Having formed the rearguard during the withdrawal from Greece, they had embarked separately from the main body, being taken aboard the Costa Rica. During the voyage to Alexandria, the transport had been attacked by German aircraft, and as <b>it</b> <b>sank,</b> they were ordered to abandon ship. After being rescued by Royal Navy destroyers, the troops were transported to Crete, where they were formed into a composite battalion with men from other units of the 16th Brigade, and together the unit became known as the 16th Brigade Composite Battalion.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the defeat}} of the Japanese surface fleet the IJN {{deployed}} submarines to disrupt Allied supply lines by attacking shipping off the Australian east coast. This campaign began with an unsuccessful midget submarine raid on Sydney Harbour on the night of 31 May 1942. Following this attack, Japanese submarines operated along the Australian east coast until August 1942, sinking eight merchant ships. The submarine offensive resumed in January 1943 and continued until June during which time a further 15ships were sunk off the east coast. The 1943 sinkings included the hospital ship Centaur, which was torpedoed off Queensland on 14 May with the loss of 268lives. The Japanese did not conduct further submarine attacks against Australia after June 1943 as their submarines were needed to counter Allied offensives elsewhere in the Pacific. A single German submarine, U-862, operated in the Pacific Ocean during the war, cruising off the Australian coast and New Zealand in December 1944 and January 1945. <b>It</b> <b>sank</b> two ships in Australian waters before returning to Batavia.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, {{a team of}} {{researchers}} consisting of Nobel Prize–winning physicist Luis Alvarez, his son geologist Walter Alvarez, and chemists Frank Asaro and Helen Michel discovered that sedimentary layers found all over the world at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary contain a concentration of iridium many times greater than normal (30, 160, and 20 times in three sections originally studied). Iridium is extremely rare in Earth's crust because it is a siderophile element, and therefore, most of it traveled with the iron as <b>it</b> <b>sank</b> into Earth's core during planetary differentiation. As iridium remains abundant in most asteroids and comets, the Alvarez team suggested that an asteroid struck the Earth {{at the time of the}} K–Pg boundary. There were earlier speculations on the possibility of an impact event, but this was the first hard evidence of an impact.|$|E

5|$|In January 1833, {{strong winds}} forced {{the old and}} poorly built Jaguaripe aground off Santa Marta beach in the {{southern}} province of Santa Catarina, where <b>it</b> <b>sank.</b> Joaquim Inácio was again the last to abandon ship. The entire crew was rescued, though he himself barely survived. Joaquim Inácio {{and his younger brother}} Bento José (who was also a navy officer) stayed afloat by holding onto a leather basket until reaching the shore. Afterward, Joaquim Inácio was court martialed and absolved of any wrongdoing. On 5 April 1833, he was given command of the barque-brig Vinte e nove de agosto (the same ship he had saved in 1828) and sailed to the province of Maranhão. The last time {{he had been in the}} province was in 1825. He remained stationed in the provincial capital (São Luís) as chief of the port until his return to Rio de Janeiro on 30 December 1836. He was transferred to the steam barque Urânia in 1837 and later, on 19 July of the same year, to the brig Constança (a different vessel than the schooner he lost in 1827).|$|E
5|$|Next, she put in {{for repairs}} at Norfolk, Virginia until 8 March, {{when she left}} for fleet {{exercises}} near Cuba. Following this, Harding left for New York, arriving there on 14 April. On 1 May, she departed {{as part of a}} group of destroyers acting as a guide for a flight of Navy Curtiss NC seaplanes across the Atlantic Ocean. Harding provided searchlight illumination by night during the first part of the flight; NC-1 and NC-3 made forced landings near the Azores and Harding rendered assistance to NC-1 before <b>it</b> <b>sank.</b> NC-4, the remaining seaplane, arrived at Ponta Delgada 20 May and as she took off for the last leg of her journey, Harding got underway to provide radio compass signals at sea. After the seaplanes landed at Plymouth, England, to complete the flight on 31 May 1919, Harding visited Brest, France and the Azores before returning to Newport 18 June. For several months, Harding was based out of Newport and Norfolk on training exercises.|$|E
5|$|The {{screenplay}} for Whisky Galore! {{was written by}} Compton Mackenzie and Angus MacPhail, based on Mackenzie's own novel; he received £500 {{for the rights to}} the book, and a further £1,000 because of the film's profitability. Mackendrick and Danischewsky also worked on the script before further input from the writers Elwyn Ambrose and Donald Campbell, and the actor James Robertson Justice, who also appeared in the film. The film and novel's story was based on an incident in the Second World War, when the cargo ship SS Politician ran aground off the north coast of Eriskay in the Outer Hebrides. Local inhabitants from the island, and from nearby South Uist, heard that the ship was carrying 22,000 cases of whisky; they rescued 7,000 from the wreck before <b>it</b> <b>sank.</b> Mackenzie, a Home Guard commander on the island, took no action against the removal of the whisky. The plot underwent some modification and condensation from the novel, {{with a lot of the}} background removed; in particular, much of the religious aspect of the novel was left out, with the novel's Protestant Great Todday and Roman Catholic Little Todday being merged into the single island of Todday.|$|E

5|$|Faced {{with the}} threat of the Darkness – {{revealed}} {{over the course of the}} series to be God's 'sister', sacrificed to create the world – Castiel agrees to act as Lucifer's vessel when Lucifer claims to be the only one with the power to defeat the Darkness, since God is absent and all other archangels are dead or insane. After killing Rowena, apparently the only person capable of re-opening the Cage, Lucifer spends some time re-establishing his power base in Hell while acting as Castiel to interact with the Winchesters and follow their research into Amara, but his true identity is revealed after the Winchesters attempt to travel back in time to recover a Hand of God from a submarine before <b>it</b> <b>sank</b> in 1943. Castiel is able to regain control long enough to explain the situation to Sam and stop himself killing his friend, Dean subsequently banishing Lucifer and vowing to find a way to free Castiel from his control. Crowley, forced to act as Lucifer's slave, is forced on the run after he fails to kill Lucifer with another salvaged Hand of God. The Winchesters manage to get through to Castiel when preparing for a new confrontation with Amara, but Castiel resolves to remain as Lucifer's Vessel until her defeat, only for the Hand of God to fail against Amara's power. With Castiel/Lucifer now Amara's prisoner, she decides to torture an archangel to try and lure God out, leaving the Winchesters to speculate that Lucifer couldn't use the Hand of God due to the fact that he is a fallen archangel. Lucifer is eventually rescued when God returns – revealed to be Chuck, the author who wrote the Winchester Gospels – with God/Chuck healing Lucifer and apologising for his past actions. Although Lucifer is apparently killed in the later confrontation with Amara, Castiel is healed and returned to control of his body, although he is then banished when a member of the London branch of the Men of Letters attacks the bunker to punish Sam's past actions.|$|E
