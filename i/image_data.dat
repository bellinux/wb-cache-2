Continuity and trustworthy dimensional reduction methods are well-known promising nonlinear methods are used to visualize different data sets, as medical images. How-ever, their visualizations face the problem of false colors which lead the specialist to make wrong analysis of patient status. To over-comes these errors, we will combine these two methods in one to generate hybrid method has continuity and trustworthiness proper-ties. The proposed method produces best visualization by perfect pre-serving the corresponding color distances between visualization and original data sets in high-dimensional space. The application of hybrid method shows it is interested for visualizing medical im-ages data sets. It has been compared with the continuity methods (as Isomap) and the trustworthy method (as curvilinear distance analysis (CDA)). The results proves the efficiency of of the pro-posed method in visualizing medical <b>images</b> <b>data</b> sets, where the false colors in the visualization are overcome as well as pos-sible.

We report on both short- and long-term user studies: one labcontrolled, involving 43 users and 17 diverse images, the other a field test of 223 user accounts. We provide empirical evidence that hot-spots do exist for many images, some more so than others. explore the use of “human-computation ” (in this context, harvesting click-points from a small set of users) to predict these hot-spots. We generate two “human-seeded ” attacks based on this method: one based on a first-order Markov model, another based on an independent probability model. Within 100 guesses, our first-order Markov model-based attack finds 4 % of passwords in one <b>image’s</b> <b>data</b> set, and 10 % of passwords in a second <b>image’s</b> <b>data</b> set. Our independent model-based attack finds 20 % within 2 33 guesses in one <b>image’s</b> <b>data</b> set and 36 % within 2 31 guesses in a second <b>image’s</b> <b>data</b> set. These are all for a system whose full password space has cardinality 2 43. We also evaluate our first-order Markov model-based attack with cross-validation of the field study data, which finds an average of 7 - 10 % of user passwords within 3 guesses. We also begin to explore some click-order pattern attacks, which we found improve on our independent model-based attacks. Our results suggest that these graphical password schemes (with parameters as originally proposed) are vulnerable to offline and online attacks, even on systems that implement conservative lock-out policies...|$|R
