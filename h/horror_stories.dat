In addition to this series, Blair also appears in a manga adaptation of the novel Gossip Girl: Psycho Killer, a parody of <b>horror</b> <b>stories.</b>|$|E
5|$|In The Orphant Annie Story Book (1921), author Johnny Gruelle augments the character’s {{background}} story {{and goes to}} great lengths to soften her image, portraying her as telling pleasant tales of fairies, gnomes and anthropomorphic animals rather than her characteristic <b>horror</b> <b>stories.</b>|$|E
5|$|In her book, Folklore, <b>Horror</b> <b>Stories,</b> and the Slender Man: The Development of an Internet Mythology, Professor Shira Chess of the University of Georgia {{connected}} the Slender Man to ancient folklore about fairies. Like fairies, Slender Man is otherworldly, with motives {{that are often}} difficult to grasp; like fairies, his appearance is vague and often shifts to reflect what the viewer wants or fears to see, and, like fairies, the Slender Man calls the woods and wild places his home and kidnaps children.|$|E

5|$|Bold {{experiments}} in cinematic storytelling were sometimes attempted during the classic era: Lady in the Lake, for example, is shot entirely {{from the point}} of view of protagonist Philip Marlowe; the face of star (and director) Robert Montgomery is seen only in mirrors. The Chase (1946) takes oneirism and fatalism as the basis for its fantastical narrative system, redolent of certain <b>horror</b> <b>stories,</b> but with little precedent in the context of a putatively realistic genre. In their different ways, both Sunset Boulevard and D.O.A. are tales told by dead men. Latter-day noir has been in the forefront of structural experimentation in popular cinema, as exemplified by such films as Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, and Memento.|$|E
5|$|Many {{works of}} crime and horror have been set in the Peak. The Terror of Blue John Gap by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859–1930) recounts terrible events at the Blue John mines, and Sherlock Holmes investigates the {{kidnapping}} of {{a child in the}} region in The Adventure of the Priory School. Many of the <b>horror</b> <b>stories</b> of local author Robert Murray Gilchrist (1878–1916) feature Peak settings. More recently, Stephen Booth has written a series of crime novels set in various real and imagined Peak locations, while In Pursuit of the Proper Sinner, an Inspector Lynley mystery by Elizabeth George, is set on the fictional Calder Moor.|$|E
5|$|Crowley's {{inheritance}} {{was running}} out. Trying to earn money, {{he was hired}} by George Montagu Bennett, the Earl of Tankerville, to help protect him from witchcraft; recognising Bennett's paranoia as being based in his cocaine addiction, Crowley took him on holiday to France and Morocco to recuperate. In 1907, he also began taking in paying students, whom he instructed in occult and magical practice. Victor Neuburg, whom Crowley met in February 1907, became his sexual partner and closest disciple; in 1908 the pair toured northern Spain before heading to Tangier, Morocco. The following year Neuburg stayed at Boleskine, where he and Crowley engaged in sadomasochism. Crowley continued to write prolifically, producing such works of poetry as Ambergris, Clouds Without Water, and Konx Om Pax, as well as his first attempt at an autobiography, The World's Tragedy. Recognising the popularity of short <b>horror</b> <b>stories,</b> Crowley wrote his own, some of which were published, and he also published several articles in Vanity Fair, a magazine edited by his friend Frank Harris. He also wrote Liber 777, a book of magical and Qabalistic correspondences that borrowed from Mathers and Bennett.|$|E

5|$|Writers {{have placed}} the story within several {{different}} genres, including science fiction, a subgenre {{of science fiction}} called recursive science fiction, and fantasy. Masters of the Occult author Daniel Cohen noted the book contributed to Hubbard's reception among influential science fiction authors of the 1940s. It is regarded as classic science fiction by The Houghton Mifflin Dictionary of Biography in its entry on Hubbard, {{as well as by}} writer James Gunn, and publications including the Daily News of Los Angeles, and Chicago Sun-Times. Writers have placed Typewriter in the Sky within the Golden Age of Science Fiction. Authors Mike Resnick and Robert J. Sawyer classed the story within the science fiction subgenre recursive science fiction, and writer Gary Westfahl wrote that Hubbard may have been influenced by the 1921 Luigi Pirandello play within the recursive fantasy subgenre, Six Characters in Search of an Author. The book is listed in Fantasy: The 100 Best Books, and Rivals of Weird Tales: 30 Great Fantasy and <b>Horror</b> <b>Stories</b> from the Weird Fiction Pulps placed it among the best quality fantasy writing of the 20th century. Writers characterized the overarching theme within the book as dealing with an individual caught between two different worlds.|$|E
25|$|The {{adjective}} antediluvian {{is sometimes}} used figuratively {{to refer to}} anything that is of great age or outmoded. H. P. Lovecraft was particularly fond of the term, using it frequently in his <b>horror</b> <b>stories.</b>|$|E

25|$|After his death, Hodgson's {{work was}} largely forgotten. In the 1930s, however, Hodgson's supernatural fiction was anthologised in both Colin de la Mare's They Walk Again (1931) and Dennis Wheatley's A Century of <b>Horror</b> <b>Stories</b> (1935); this began {{a revival of}} {{interest}} in Hodgson's work.|$|E
25|$|Palahniuk's books {{prior to}} Lullaby have {{distinct}} similarities. The characters {{are people who}} have been marginalized {{in one way or another}} by society, and often react with self-destructive aggressiveness. He labels these stories as transgressional fiction. Beginning with Lullaby, the style of his novels changed to mostly satirical <b>horror</b> <b>stories.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1999, The Unholy Grail was {{published}} as {{a sequel to}} Groosham Grange. The Unholy Grail was renamed as Return to Groosham Grange in 2003, possibly to help readers understand {{the connection between the}} books. Horowitz Horror (1999) and More Horowitz Horror (2000) saw Horowitz exploring a darker side of his writing. Each book contains several short <b>horror</b> <b>stories.</b> Many of these stories were repackaged in twos or threes as the Pocket Horowitz series.|$|E
25|$|Like {{both his}} brothers, Edward Frederic Benson ("Fred") and Arthur Christopher Benson, Robert wrote many ghost and <b>horror</b> <b>stories,</b> {{as well as}} children's stories and {{historical}} fiction. His horror and ghost fiction are collected in The Light Invisible (1903) and A Mirror of Shallott (1907). His novel, Lord of the World (1907), is generally {{regarded as one of}} the first modern dystopian novels (see List of dystopian literature). The bibliography below reveals a prodigious output.|$|E

Heck drew, over John Romita layouts, The Amazing Spider-Man #57–64, 66 (Feb.–Sept and Nov. 1968). Heck would also draw issues of Captain Marvel and Iron Man, the World War II war comic Captain Savage and his Battlefield Raiders, <b>horror</b> <b>stories</b> in Chamber of Darkness and Tower of Shadows, and, once more, love stories, in the romance comics Our Love Story and 'My Love.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, {{the team}} rejoined editor Sullivan, {{by then the}} founder and {{publisher}} of the comic-book company Magazine Enterprises where they created the short-lived comical crime-fighter Funnyman. Shuster continued to draw comics after the failure of Funnyman, although exactly what he drew is uncertain. Comic historian Ted White wrote that Shuster continued to draw <b>horror</b> <b>stories</b> into the 1950s. In 2009, comics historian Craig Yoe said Shuster was the anonymous illustrator for Nights of Horror, an underground sadomasochistic fetish paperback book series. This was based on character similarities, and comparison of the artistic style between the illustrations and those of the cast of the Superman comics.|$|E
25|$|The game's Victorian Gothic {{setting was}} partly {{inspired}} by the novel Dracula, and the architecture of locations in Romania and the Czech Republic. Miyazaki also enjoyed H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos series of surreal <b>horror</b> <b>stories,</b> and applied similar themes into the game. Miyazaki had {{wanted to create a}} game set in such an era as those novels, but he wanted everything to be as detailed as possible, and felt that such a game was only possible on eighth generation hardware. This need for high-end hardware, {{and the fact that the}} PlayStation 4 was presented to the company first, was the reason the game was a PS4 exclusive, rather than a cross-generation release. The developers' target framerate for the title was 30 frames per second, due to their design choices made for the title.|$|E
