60|$|The {{following}} {{passage from the}} argument in refutation of the Epicureans, in the second book of Cicero, “De Finibus,” affords {{a fine example of}} this sort of fallacy: “Et quidem illud ipsum non nimium probo (et tantum patior) philosophum loqui de cupiditatibus finiendis. An potest cupiditas finiri? tollenda est, atque extrahenda radicitus. Quis est enim, in quo sit cupiditas, quin recte cupidus dici possit? Ergo et avarus erit, sed finite: adulter, verum habebit modum: et luxuriosus eodem modo. Qualis ista philosophia est, quæ non interitum afferat pravitatis, sed sit contenta mediocritate vitiorum?” The question was, whether certain desires, when kept within bounds, are vices or not; and the argument decides the point by applying to them a word (cupiditas) which implies vice. It is shown, however, in the remarks which follow, that Cicero did not intend this as a serious argument, but as a criticism on what he deemed an <b>inappropriate</b> <b>expression.</b> “Rem ipsam prorsus probo: elegantiam desidero. Appellet hæc desideria naturæ; cupiditatis nomen servet alio,” etc. But many persons, both ancient and modern, have employed this, or something equivalent to it, as a real and conclusive argument. We may remark that the passage respecting cupiditas and cupidus is also an example of another fallacy already noticed, that of Paronymous Terms.|$|E

Near Rio de Janeiro I used often {{to sit in the}} evening to listen to a number of little Hylæ, which, perched on blades of grass close to the water, sent forth sweet chirping notes in harmony. The various sounds are emitted chiefly by the males during the breeding-season, {{as in the case of}} the croaking of our common frog.[42] In accordance with this fact the vocal organs of the males are more highly developed than those of the females. In some genera the males alone are provided with sacs which open into the larynx.[43] For instance, in the edible frog (Rana esculenta) “the sacs are peculiar to the males, and become, when filled with air in the act of croaking, large globular bladders, standing out one on each side of the head, near the corners of the mouth.” The croak of the male is thus rendered exceedingly powerful; whilst that of the female is only a slight groaning noise.[44] The vocal organs differ considerably in structure in the several genera of the family; and their development in all cases may be attributed to sexual selection.|$|E

40|$|Graphene {{plasmonics}} is {{of great}} interest for compact optical devices working in broad frequency domains with ultrahigh speed and very low energy consumption. However, graphene plasmons damp out quickly on most substrates mainly due to scattering loss from substrate surface phonons and impurities. Here we discover a new hybridized plasmon-phonon polariton mode in graphene/h-BN van der Waals heterostructures, which enables ultralong hybrid plasmon lifetime up to 1. 6 picosecond, the longest plasmon lifetime ever demonstrated. Such remarkably long lifetime arises from the coupling of long-lifetime h-BN transverse optical phonon with graphene plasmons, which uniquely exists in monolayer heterostructures. Our findings and understanding of this unexploited hybrid mode offer a novel approach to tune the plasmon behaviours in the frequency, time and space domains. This can potentially introduce a new paradigm to generate highly-confined plasmons with ultra-long lifetime for various applications, such as deep-subwavelength metamaterials, ultra-low-loss waveguides, and ultrafast optical switches.
