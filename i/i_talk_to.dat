500|$|During his youth, Starr {{had been}} a devoted fan of skiffle and blues music, {{but by the time}} he joined the Texans in 1958, he had {{developed}} a preference for rock and roll. He was also influenced by country artists, including Hank Williams, Buck Owens and Hank Snow, and jazz artists such as Chico Hamilton and Yusef Lateef, whose compositional style inspired Starr's fluid and energetic drum fills and grooves. While reflecting on Buddy Rich, Starr commented: [...] "He does things with one hand that I can't do with nine, but that's technique. Everyone <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> says 'What about Buddy Rich?' Well, what about him? Because he doesn't turn me on." [...] He stated that he [...] "was never really into drummers", but identified Cozy Cole 1958 cover of Benny Goodman [...] "Topsy Part Two" [...] as [...] "the one drum record" [...] he bought.|$|E

In 1967 alone, the year I {{supposedly}} made that comment, we recorded Wild Honey, an R album that was entirely different from anything we'd ever done, and I cowrote ten songs and sang three leads." [...] In 1975, he voiced appreciation of the musical form and content of [...] "Surf's Up" [...] from Smile, which he believed went beyond what is normally expected of commercial pop music, {{and in the same}} 1992 article where he refers to some of the Pet Sounds lyrics as [...] "nauseating", he calls Parks a [...] "very gifted musician", saying: [...] "He's great. He's one of the nicest persons in the world. And I tell him, 'Hey, I thought your lyrics, Van Dyke, were brilliant, except who the fuck knows what you're talking about!' That's exactly how <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him (laughs). And he and I joke about it." [...] He considers that [...] "a lot of people don't understand I {{have a sense of humor}} that's kind of wack, or different, or sometimes bratty, so I get labeled with that and there goes my image, right down the toilet." ...|$|E

The single peaked at No.9 on the Billboard Magazine Hot Country Singles chart and No.30 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 singles chart. In October 1965, Smith released her second studio album Cute 'n' Country. The album featured both cover versions of other country songs and newer songs written by Bill Anderson. It included cover versions of songs by such artists as Jim Reeves, Webb Pierce, and Ray Price. Like her first album, Cute 'n' Country reached No.1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart and spent thirty {{weeks on the chart}} as well. Her next two singles, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>Talk</b> <b>to</b> Him" [...] and [...] "Nobody But a Fool (Would Love You)", both reached No.4 on the Hot Country Singles chart and were issued on Smith's third album, Miss Smith Goes to Nashville (1966). The album peaked at No.2 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. With her next few sessions, Smith's producer Bob Ferguson felt pressured from RCA headquarters in New York City to market Smith's sound toward more [...] "middle-of-the-road" [...] country pop material. This change of sound was evident on her next two studio albums Born to Sing (1966) and Downtown Country (1967). Both albums featured full orchestras in the background and cover versions of singles by pop artists of the time. Spawned from Born to Sing and Downtown Country [...] were the singles [...] "Ain't Had No Lovin'" [...] and [...] "The Hurtin's All Over", which both peaked within the Top 5 on the Hot Country Singles chart.|$|E

Russert did say, however, that Plame's identity as a CIA operative was not leaked to him. Russert testified again in the trial on February 7, 2007. According to the Washington Post, Russert testified that [...] "when any senior government official calls him, they are presumptively off the record," [...] saying: [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> senior government officials on the phone, it's my own policy our conversations are confidential.

2500|$|That season, Derby {{failed to}} retain their title, {{finishing}} 7th, but reached the semi-finals of the European Cup in April 1973, when they were knocked out by Juventus 3–1 on aggregate. After the game, Clough emerged from the dressing room and told the expectant Italian reporters [...] "No cheating bastards do <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to.</b> I will not talk to any cheating bastards" [...] and then questioned the Italian nation's courage in the Second World War. It was these sorts of frequent, outspoken comments – particularly against football's establishment, such as the FA and club directors, and figures in the game such as Sir Matt Busby, Alan Hardaker, Alf Ramsey, Don Revie and Len Shipman, along with players such as Billy Bremner, Norman Hunter and Peter Lorimer – combined with Clough's increased media profile, that eventually led to his falling out with the Rams' chairman, Sam Longson, and the Derby County board of directors.|$|E
2500|$|The {{results of}} the {{thousands}} of teeth analyzed, published in the November 24, 1961, issue of the journal Science, revealed elevated levels of radioactive compounds in the first sets of teeth that had been collected. President John F. Kennedy was made aware of the research results while he was negotiating a treaty with the United Kingdom and Soviet Union to place controls on nuclear testing. His call to the Reiss home was answered by her son; the person {{on the other end of}} the phone said, [...] "This is John Kennedy, can <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> your mom?" [...] Further analysis by the team led to the conclusion that children born in 1963 had absorbed levels of strontium-90 that were 50 times higher than those found in children born a decade earlier. Her husband, Eric Reiss, testified before the United States Senate when it was considering ratification of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Later research showed that levels of strontium-90 in the cohort born in 1968, after the treaty had gone into effect, had declined by 50 percent.|$|E

For songs she did not co-write, Duff discussed her experiences and feelings with the writers and ask them to write songs about them. Members of the creative team behind Metamorphosis who returned for Hilary Duff include Charlie Midnight, John Shanks and Kara DioGuardi (who collaborated on the commercially released singles), Andre Recke, Marc Swersky and Duff's sister Haylie. Hilary said, [...] "I do have a lot to say, and I have a lot going on inside that sometimes is buried and hidden because I'm working so hard, and I don't have time to think about it.

2500|$|St. Elsewheres series finale {{featured}} momentous {{changes for}} several main characters, including the departures of Drs.

[...] The finale is more known for its provocative final scene: Westphall and his son Tommy Westphall (played by Chad Allen), who has autism, are seen in Dr. Auschlander's office watching snow falling outside. The image cuts to an exterior shot of the hospital. At that moment, Tommy and Daniel Auschlander are seen in an apartment building, with Tommy playing with a snow globe. Donald arrives home from a day of work, and {{it is clear from the}} uniform he wears and the dialog in this scene that he works in construction. [...] "Auschlander" [...] is revealed to be Donald's father, and thus Tommy's grandfather. Donald laments to his father, [...] "I don't understand this autism thing, Pop. Here's my son. <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him. I don't even know if he can hear me, because he sits there, all day long, in his own world, staring at that toy. What's he thinking about?" [...] As Tommy shakes the snow globe, he is told by his father to come and wash his hands for dinner. Donald places the snow globe on the family's television set and walks into the kitchen with Tommy and Auschlander; as they leave the room, the camera closes in on the snow globe—which holds a replica of St. Eligius.|$|E
