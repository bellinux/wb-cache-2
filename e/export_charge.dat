40|$|In 2008, the Australian Government {{deregulated}} {{the marketing}} of bulk wheat exports by removing the ‘single desk’ operated by AWB (International) Limited. Wheat Exports Australia (WEA) was established under the Wheat Export Marketing Act 2008 (WEMA) to administer an accreditation scheme for bulk wheat exporters. The Wheat Export Accreditation Scheme 2008 (Scheme) also came into effect on 1 July 2008, {{making it possible for}} any trader, once accredited, to export bulk wheat from that date.

The legislation also required the Productivity Commission to conduct a review of the arrangements, commencing no later than 1 January 2010 and reporting to the Australian Government by 1 July 2010. Among other key messages, the Commission has found the transition to competition in the exporting of bulk wheat has progressed relatively smoothly, particularly given difficult international trading conditions; the regulatory arrangements for marketing bulk wheat exports have been beneficial during the transitional phase since deregulation; the accreditation scheme, Wheat Exports Australia and the Wheat <b>Export</b> <b>Charge</b> should be abolished on 30 September 2011; the port terminal access test has provided greater certainty for traders and made access easier, more timely and less costly than it could have been by relying on potential declaration under Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act; however, there are still some transitional issues associated with port access and contestability in the logistics supply chain. wheat export marketing act; wheat export; Accreditation Scheme; wheat export; Wheat Exports Australia; bulk wheat; accreditation; grain supply; export supply chain; single desk...|$|E
40|$|This inquiry {{assessed}} {{the operation of}} the current wheat export marketing arrangements, including the costs and benefits, and now informs the Australian Government on the effectiveness of the arrangements. These key points were released with the Wheat Export Marketing Arrangements inquiry report on 28 October 2010. The transition to competition in the exporting of bulk wheat has progressed relatively smoothly, particularly given difficult international trading conditions — a pronounced commodity price cycle, the global financial crisis, and exchange rate appreciation. The regulatory arrangements for marketing bulk wheat exports have been beneficial during the transitional phase since deregulation. They have given growers confidence in adjusting to deregulation and facilitated the rapid entry of 28 accredited traders, with 12 million tonnes exported to 41 countries in the first year after deregulation. A range of marketing options have become available since deregulation. However, some growers prefer the previous single desk arrangements. The benefits of accreditation of traders will rapidly diminish in the post transitional phase, leaving only the costs. The accreditation scheme, Wheat Exports Australia and the Wheat <b>Export</b> <b>Charge</b> should be abolished on 30 September 2011. The port terminal access test has provided greater certainty for traders and made access easier, more timely and less costly than it could have been by relying on potential declaration under Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act. However, there are still some transitional issues associated with port access and contestability in the logistics supply chain. The access test accordingly should remain a condition for port operators to export bulk wheat until 30 September 2014. The benefits of the access test will diminish and could become costly in the long term without the checks and balances of Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act. From 1 October 2014, regulated access should rely on Part IIIA, with continuation of mandatory disclosure, supplemented by a voluntary code of conduct by all port terminal services operators. There is evidence that increasing on-farm storage, and competition between road and rail, are leading to improvements in supply chain efficiency. However, {{it is important that the}} regulatory arrangements enhance efficiency in the transport and storage market by facilitating contestability. The Commission supports the decision by the ACCC to review the exclusive dealing notification in relation to Grain Express in Western Australia. The level and allocation of investment in road and rail infrastructure by governments should be based on rigorous cost-benefit analysis, with a focus on developing economically and socially efficient logistics chains.

If possible, provide a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the impacts of the issue on you and the IESO-administered markets. Include the Chapter and Section number of the relevant market rules. Summary This amendment proposes to clarify the intent of the Market Rule and accounting treatment for units operating in segregated mode of operation. This amendment is necessary to: (a) ensure units operating in segregated mode of operation are treated consistently as export from Ontario, and pay all the charges and costs assigned to Export transactions; and (b) ensure units operating in segregated mode of operation are not paid CMSC payments or IOG payments when the same entity also is exporting or importing into Ontario (creating an implied wheel through transaction). This amendment proposal is deemed to be urgent as it meets the following statutory criteria: • “avoid, reduce the risk of or mitigate the effects of an unintended adverse effect of a market rule” (section 34. 1. 4 of the Electricity Act, 1998). The existing market rules regarding Segregated Mode of Operation, CMSC and IOG payments may result in the adverse impact of avoiding <b>export</b> <b>charges,</b> plus creating CMSC and/or IOG payments that are not consistent with the intent of both CMSC and IOG payments.

40|$|How do {{signatures}} {{required for}} exporting and business registration procedures affect {{the volume and}} composition of country''s exports? To answer this question, I develop a model where a country can export two types of products: differentiated and homogeneous. I show that export signatures and registration procedures reduce overall exports by increasing transaction costs. The impact, however, varies across goods according to the product''s degree of differentiation- the lack of price data on differentiated products due to their heterogeneity makes them more sensitive to export signatures. Regressions show that each extra signature exporters have to collect before a shipment can take place reduces aggregate exports by 4. 2 percent. The impact is large, equivalent to raising importer''s tariff by 5 percentage points. Furthermore, each signature lowers exports of differentiated products by 4 - 5 percent more than exports of homogeneous goods. I find evidence that business registration procedures affect exports of differentiated products only.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The United States and Canada {{have been involved in}} a long-standing dispute regarding the softwood lumber trade. Canada is the primary exporter of softwood lumber to the United States. In 2008, Canada exported approximately $ 3. 2 billion worth of softwood lumber products to the United States, about 17 times the amount supplied by the next biggest exporter to the United States. After several years of litigation related to U. S. allegations of unfair Canadian subsidies, the United States and Canada signed the 2006 Softwood Lumber Agreement ("agreement"). The agreement ended ongoing litigation and requires, among other things, Canadian federal and provincial governments to establish <b>export</b> <b>charges</b> and quotas for Canadian lumber exports and for the two countries to exchange information to support monitoring compliance with the agreement. In 2008, the United States passed the Softwood Lumber Act that requires, among other things, that the U. S. government reconcile and verify softwood lumber trade data. The act also requires GAO to report on (1) whether countries that export softwood lumber or softwood lumber products to the United States are complying with international agreements entered into by those countries and the United States; and (2) the effectiveness of the U. S. government in carrying out the reconciliations and verifications mandated by the Softwood Lumber Act. This letter contains information in response to the first mandate concerning compliance with international softwood lumber agreements. In accordance with our agreement with the Senate Committee on Finance and the House Ways and Means Committee, we will issue a separate report in December 2009 that will supply additional information and findings on U.

We focused on Canada because it is the only country with which the United States has an agreement specifically related to softwood lumber and is by far the largest exporter of softwood lumber to the United States. We are not conducting a legal review of compliance with the Softwood Lumber Agreement. Our objectives in this review are to describe (1) U.

40|$|When {{confronted with}} invading microorganisms, {{neutrophils}} undergo {{a number of}} nearly synchronous reactions including the generation of microbicidal reactive oxygen intermediates by the NADPH oxidase. These reactions are accompanied by a slow depolarization, from resting values of- 60 mV to levels probably exceeding 0 mV. The depolarization is transient, indicating that a compensatory charge transport mechanism is activated. Activation of the oxidase system causes a massive burst of metabolic acid generation that would, if uncompensated, lower the intracellular pH of neutrophils by over 5 units, to lethal levels (pH = 2). Neutrophils must therefore possess particularly effective regulatory systems to avoid excessive cytosolic acidification. The recently described H+ conductance of neutrophils may counteract both the acidification and the depolarization. Activation of the H+ conductance occurs at depolarizing voltages and is promoted by cytosolic acidification, a combination that takes place during the respiratory burst. The NADPH oxidase of neutrophils is thus associated to an unusual, particularly efficient mechanism of H+ <b>export</b> and <b>charge</b> compensation. The sequential activation of these two systems causes neutrophils to depolarize through the activation of an electron transport chain, and to repolarize through the activation of a H+ conductance...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn orally {{acquired}} bacteria, {{the ability}} to counteract extreme acid stress (pH⩽ 2. 5) ensures survival during transit through the animal host stomach. In several neutralophilic bacteria, the glutamate-dependent acid resistance system (GDAR) is the most efficient molecular system in conferring protection from acid stress. In Escherichia coli its structural components are {{either of the two}} glutamate decarboxylase isoforms (GadA, GadB) and the antiporter, GadC, which imports glutamate and exports γ-aminobutyrate, the decarboxylation product. The system works by consuming protons intracellularly, as part of the decarboxylation reaction, and <b>exporting</b> positive <b>charges</b> via the antiporter. Herein, biochemical and spectroscopic properties of GadB from Brucella microti (BmGadB), a Brucella species which possesses GDAR, are described.

BmGadB is hexameric at acidic pH. The pH-dependent spectroscopic properties and activity profile, combined with in silico sequence comparison with E. coli GadB (EcGadB), suggest that BmGadB has the necessary structural requirements for the binding of activating chloride ions at acidic pH and for the closure of its active site at neutral pH.

One of the few tools still available to policy makers under the WTO rules is antidumping law — and antidumping investigations have become a major imped-iment to free trade.

In the calibrated model, the existing U. S. antidumping policy has an aggregate impact equiv-alent to a 6 percent tariff that is uniformly applied to all firms. The welfare costs of antidumping policy come, not only from the higher prices charged by firms subject to antidumping duties, but also from the higher prices that all <b>exporting</b> firms optimally <b>charge</b> in order to minimize the prob-ability of being accused of dumping. *I would like to thank John Asker, Eric Bond, and Mike Waugh for helpful discussions.

40|$|AbstractThe {{kinetics}} and thermodynamics of {{forward and}} reverse electron transfer around the reaction center of purple bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides were studied in vivo by flash-excited delayed fluorescence, prompt fluorescence (induction) and kinetic difference absorption. By {{protection of the}} photomultiplier from intense bacteriochlorophyll prompt fluorescence evoked by laser excitation, the time resolution of the fluorometer was reduced typically 10  μs. Two precursor states of the delayed fluorescence were identified: P+QA− and cyt c 23 +QA− whose enthalpy levels were 340  meV and 1020  meV below A⁎, respectively. The free energy of the P+QA− state relative to A⁎ was − 870  meV in whole cells. Similar values were obtained earlier for isolated reaction center and chromatophore. The free energies of cyt c 23 +QA− and P+QA− states showed no or very weak (− 6  meV/pH unit) pH-dependence, respectively, supporting the concept of pH-independent redox midpoint potential of QA/QA− in intact cells. In accordance with the multiphasic kinetics of delayed fluorescence, the kinetics of re-opening of the closed reaction center is also complex (it extends up to 1  s) {{as a consequence of}} acceptor and donor-side reactions. The control of <b>charge</b> <b>export</b> from the reaction center by light regime, redox agents and inhibitors is investigated. The complex kinetics may arise from the distribution of quinones in different redox states on the acceptor side (QB binding site and pool) and from organization of electron transfer components in supercomplexes...|$|R

40|$|A dynamic, game theoretic {{model with}} {{switching}} costs provides {{better understanding of}} motives that keep export subsidies a part of exporters 2 ̆ 7 agricultural policies. Switching costs include factors, such as transactions costs and political considerations, that affect an importer 2 ̆ 7 s purchasing decisions. Effects of these costs are dynamic in nature, because switching costs vary {{with the level of}} earlier purchases. ^ Behaviors of exporting countries and firms are not driven solely by maximization of current welfare and profits, but also by the desire to increase current market share, which could improve future welfare and profits. In our multi-period framework, exporting countries face a tradeoff between exploiting current market share with higher prices and lower export subsidies, or competing for larger market shares with lower prices and larger subsidies. ^ In wheat export competition to Morocco, the EU and U. S. are noncooperatively behaving 2 ̆ 2 super-powers 2 ̆ 2 whose actions influence each other 2 ̆ 7 s agricultural policies and world prices. Subsidized exports of EU and U. S. wheat are sold abroad by large exporting firms who may also have market power. ^ Econometric estimates of import demand functions suggest switching costs exist in the Moroccan market, and switching costs from U. S. wheat are larger than costs from EU wheat. <b>Exporting</b> firms <b>charge</b> lower prices and higher export subsidies are awarded by governments when switching costs are present. This suggests that costs of export promotion programs may be higher than is often expected. ^ Investigation of alternative institutional arrangements (game structures) showed that unilateral elimination of export subsidies is the worst scenario for the country eliminating subsidies. Improvement of U. S. welfare in the free trade case explained its initial willingness to eliminate export subsidies under GATT. MacSharry CAP reform helped make GATT upper bounds for EU export subsidies more acceptable, consistent with the notion that it was an important element in reaching GATT agreement. ^ Finally, results show that, while it is important for exporting countries to prevent formation of a firm cartel, some degree of firm level market power is welfare improving for exporters. Results also suggest that order of play has important implications for players 2 ̆ 7 market power and so, strategic behavior. ...|$|R
