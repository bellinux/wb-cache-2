His <b>first</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> shine in the Senate came in the dispute between ex-preator Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo and Lucius Cornelius Sulla. Cornelius failed to give his seat to Corbula at a gladiatorial show, and the {{incident}} sparked a debate between the rights of age and the defenders of tradition, in which Drusus argued a rapprochement. In another, it was proposed by Caecina Severus that the wives of governors be banned from joining their husbands in the provinces. Caecina delivered a speech in support of the bill, followed with speeches by both Valerius Messalinus and Drusus in opposition to it. The proposal was then abandoned, not because of the arguments made, but because of the intervention of an external force (the auctoritas of Drusus) the same reason for the later repeal of the Oppian law (lex Oppia).|$|E

5|$|Before {{the start}} of extra time Cardiff made their first {{substitution}} of the match, goalscorer Mason was replaced by Filip Kiss. Liverpool had the <b>first</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> score in extra time, but Suárez's header was cleared off the line by Andrew Taylor. Cardiff appeared to be playing for a penalty shoot-out, as they were positioning {{the majority of their}} team behind the ball and in front of their goal. Cardiff captain Hudson was replaced in the 98th minute by Anthony Gerrard after suffering from cramp. Liverpool had another chance in the 101st minute, when a pass by Gerrard was cleared for a corner kick by Taylor. The resulting corner was met by Carroll, but his header was wide of the Cardiff goal. Immediately after the attack Carroll was replaced by Dirk Kuyt. Just {{before the end of the}} first half of extra time Liverpool had another chance. Bellamy went past two men down the left hand side of the pitch before exchanging passes with Kuyt, however his subsequent shot went wide.|$|E
5|$|Manager Johnny Duncan {{identified}} Revie as {{the player}} {{to build his}} team around for the 1947–48 and 1948–49 seasons, and though the Foxes fared poorly in the league they managed to reach the 1949 FA Cup Final. Revie scored the opening goal of the semi-final victory over First Division champions Portsmouth, having being told pre-match that opposition goalkeeper Ernest Butler tended to palm the ball over the attacker's head before reclaiming possession Revie positioned himself {{to take advantage of}} the situation when teammate Jack Lee challenged Butler for the ball, leaving Revie with a simple conversion. However Revie suffered a nasal haemorrhage caused by a burst vein one week before the final, and the condition became so severe it would threaten his life and see him miss his <b>first</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> play at Wembley. He could only listen on the radio as Leicester lost 3–1 to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the final. Revie decided to leave Leicester after Duncan left the club, having already been dissatisfied with the club's lack of progress in the league.|$|E

5|$|On the November 27 {{episode of}} Raw, The Hardys {{had their first}} shot at Tag Team gold in five years. They took on World Tag Team Champions Rated-RKO (Edge and Randy Orton), but came up short when Edge hit Jeff {{in the back with}} a belt to get himself and Orton {{deliberately}} disqualified to retain the title. That same day, The Hardys posed an open challenge to any team for ECW December to Dismember which was immediately accepted by a reuniting MNM (Johnny Nitro and Joey Mercury). After a run in on the intervening ECW on Sci Fi, The Hardys defeated MNM at the pay-per-view, starting a feud between all four men that spanned both brands. The Hardys got their <b>first</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> gain the WWE Tag Team Championship at Armageddon, where the original tag team match was changed to a four team ladder match involving The Hardys, MNM, Dave Taylor and William Regal, and Paul London and Brian Kendrick. Despite coming up short, The Hardys sparked another feud with MNM when Mercury was legitimately injured. While Jeff and Nitro continued battling over the Intercontinental Championship on Raw, Matt and Mercury feuded on SmackDown!. Mercury and Nitro tried injuring both Hardys' faces as payback for what happened at Armageddon, claiming that The Hardys had ruined Mercury's 'Hollywood good looks'. The Hardys settled their feud with MNM at the Royal Rumble when they defeated them for the second time. Matt and Mercury continued feuding, however, which was finally settled at No Way Out.|$|E

25|$|All {{previous}} night fighter {{versions of the}} Ju 88 used a modified A-series fuselage. The G-series fuselage was purpose-built for {{the special needs of}} a night fighter, with the A-series' Bola ventral under-nose defensive gun position omitted for lower aerodynamic drag and less weight, and adding the enlarged squared-off vertical fin/rudder tail unit of the Ju 188. G-1 aircraft possessed more powerful armament and like the earlier R-1, used a pair of 1,700PS BMW 801 radial engines, the G-1 using the later BMW 801G-2 version. Electronic equipment consisted of the then-standard FuG 220 Lichtenstein SN-2 90MHz VHF radar using eight-dipole Hirschgeweih antennas, which could include fitment of the borderline-SHF-band FuG 350 Naxos radar detector with its receiving antenna housed in a teardrop-shaped streamlined fairing above the canopy, or FuG 227 Flensburg radar detector homing devices that had their own trio of twin-dipole antennae: one on each wing leading edge and one under the tail.

The Huskers got their first regular-season conference crown since 1950. The pitchers had great outings en route to a 4–0 performance winning the Big 12 Tournament for the 3rd consecutive time. They are the first team to win Big 12 regular-season and tournament titles in the same season. They were number 8 overall in the NCAA tournament and hosted a regional {{for the first time in}} team history getting wins over Northern Iowa and Rutgers.

The Texans used their second {{possession}} {{to advance to the}} red zone, but a pass from Matt Schaub intended for Andre Johnson was intercepted by Chiefs safety Jarrad Page in the end zone. Beginning the second quarter, Chiefs center Casey Wiegmann fumbled the ball, but it was recovered by quarterback Damon Huard. After a possession by the Texans, kick returned Eddie Drummond fumbled and recovered by Houston. The Texans capitalized on the turnover and scored first through a field goal. With just over six minutes left in the half, Matt Schaub completed a 77-yard pass to Andre Johnson, and the Texans secure their lead, 10–0. Beginning the third quarter, Chiefs fullback Kris Wilson appeared to have fumbled the football, although it was disputed whether or not he had possession. The fumble was recovered by Texans defensive end Mario Williams for a touchdown. The Chiefs finally scored, through a field goal, with thirty seconds remaining in the third quarter. For the first ten minutes of play in the fourth quarter, the Texans controlled the ball and kept the Chiefs' offense off the field.

In 1913, he was asked to do a fresco for the Odd Fellows lodge in Nyköping, Den helige Martin (Saint Martin, the Holy). At the same time, the new Stockholm Court House was under construction.

The opera was The Marriage of Figaro. During that evening, news came of the German invasion of Austria. Many Hungarians feared that Hitler would next invade Hungary; {{he did not do}} so, but Horthy, to strengthen his partnership with the Nazis, instituted anti-semitic laws, mirroring the Nuremberg Laws, restricting Hungary's Jews from engaging in professions. Solti's family urged him to move away. He went first to London, where he made his Covent Garden debut, conducting the London Philharmonic for a Russian ballet season. The reviewer in The Times was not impressed with Solti's efforts, finding them [...] "too violent, for he lashed at the orchestra and flogged the music so that he endangered the delicate, evocative atmosphere." [...] At about this time Solti dropped the name [...] "György" [...] in favour of [...] "Georg".|$|E

In this forum, Chicago Tribune art critic Alan G. Artner said Johnson's audio selection imposed his artistry on all the other exhibits since he chose a rap song combined with a blunt video. [...] Artner became a Johnson detractor in 2005 when Johnson had this and another simultaneous exhibit appearing in Chicago. He described Johnson's exploration of the politics of race as [...] "sloganeering or cute self-advertising" [...] in his two-dimensional works, and his apolytical three-dimensional installations as [...] "glib and superficial" [...] representations. He classified Johnson's work as more suitable for the audience seeking nothing more than American pop culture. [...] The following year, in 2006, Artner derided Johnson's short video contribution to the Art Institute of Chicago's Fool's Paradise exhibition as a [...] "conflation of gospel singing with beat boxing...that says nothing worth saying about race." [...] Other Chicago critics describe Johnson's subsequent work as relatively hip.|$|E
