5|$|Job Maarse, artistic {{director}} of Pentatone, said of the album's origins: From day one the co-operation between Pentatone and the Oregon Symphony and its Music Director Carlos Kalmar has been something magical. The quality of the orchestra and the program ideas of Carlos Kalmar {{attracted the attention of}} a large group of music lovers in and outside the U.S. During a pleasant meeting at the Chicago airport almost two years ago the idea for this new album was discussed. I believe all at the table liked it and now everybody can hear how these three pieces, although by composers with different styles, <b>fit</b> <b>perfectly</b> in one program. And of course the Copland symphony {{is one of the best}} pieces ever written by an American composer.|$|E

500|$|The {{first five}} episodes {{of the season}} were {{initially}} planned to be within the first season with the episode [...] "Bring the Pain" [...] as the season one finale. According to Rhimes, after airing the ninth episode of the show, the ratings, the timeslots and the really great audience meant {{that they have to}} end the season with that episode, and the cliffhanger with the coming of Derek's estranged wife <b>fit</b> <b>perfectly.</b> The season received positive critics and reception, and this season performed better than the previous one. Due {{to the success of the}} first season, Grey's Anatomy took over the Sunday night timeslot along with Desperate Housewives, replacing Boston Legal.|$|E
500|$|The hotel, with 325 {{guest rooms}} and a four-story central atrium, was {{designed}} to <b>fit</b> <b>perfectly</b> into its natural habitat. The trees in the area were of special concern, and particular care was taken to cut down as few as possible. He worked with an expert from Suzhou to preserve and renovate a water maze from the original hotel, one of only five in the country. Pei was also meticulous about the arrangement of items in the garden behind the hotel; he even insisted on transporting [...] of rocks from a location in southwest China to suit the natural aesthetic. An associate of Pei's said later that he never saw the architect so involved in a project.|$|E
500|$|The Pont du Gard was {{constructed}} largely {{without the use}} of mortar or clamps. It contains an estimated 50,400 tons of limestone with a volume of some some of the individual blocks weigh up to 6 tons. Most of the stone was extracted from the local quarry of Estel located approximately [...] downstream, {{on the banks of the}} Gardon River. The coarse-grained soft reddish [...] shelly limestone, [...] known locally as [...] "Pierre de Vers", [...] lends itself very well to dimension stone production. The blocks were precisely cut to <b>fit</b> <b>perfectly</b> together by friction alone, eliminating the need for mortar. The builders also left inscriptions on the stonework conveying various messages and instructions. Many blocks were numbered and inscribed with the required locations, such as fronte dextra or fronte sinistra (front right or front left), to guide the builders.|$|E

500|$|Chen plays a {{wide variety}} of video games, but he names his {{greatest}} influences as Katamari Damacy, Ico and Shadow of the Colossus. He also names Final Fantasy VII as an influence, and the game that he took his adopted name from. He personally plays games [...] "competitively", including titles such as Street Fighter IV and StarCraft. He feels he has a competitive nature, which he has turned towards [...] "winning" [...] at being a game designer by creating games that are unlike what is in the market rather than towards creating competitive games. As he was raised in China and works in America, Chen feels that he cannot fully relate to either culture as a game designer. As such, instead of trying to make games that <b>fit</b> <b>perfectly</b> with one culture he tries to make games that tap into feelings that are universal and independent of culture.|$|E
500|$|The cover {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from contemporary critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called the cover [...] "a useless remake, {{which seems to}} exist solely for its video". Spence D. of IGN said that the lyrics <b>fit</b> <b>perfectly</b> with Spears's relationship with the media at the time. He also added, [...] "As for her interpretation, it's an interesting chameleonic diversion that comes off like a mash-up between vintage Prince-styled production, Cameo swagger, and Madonna sultriness, but never seems to capture the gloss and glory {{of any of the}} aforementioned influences". Christy Lemire of msnbc.com called it [...] "utterly unnecessary". Louis Pattison of the New Musical Express commented that [...] "judging by the fuck-you sentiments" [...] of the cover, Spears liked {{to play the role of}} [...] " [...] pop brat careering off the rails". Sarah Hepola of Salon.com wrote in an article about contemporary teen idols that the cover [...] "became an anthem for teen-idol rebellion". American director Quentin Tarantino included the song in a playlist that inspired him during production of his 2009 film Inglourious Basterds.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to these supposed messages in [...] "Back Off Boogaloo", observers have viewed the song title as Starr's rebuke to McCartney to abandon his legal stand against the Beatles and Apple Corps, which was placed in receivership in March 1971 after a High Court judge found in McCartney's favour. Author Keith Badman writes that [...] "Boogaloo" [...] had [...] "long been cited as Paul's nickname" [...] from his former bandmates Starr, Lennon and George Harrison. While acknowledging that in subsequent years Starr might have chosen to minimise any ill-feeling towards McCartney, Rodriguez notes that the lyrics [...] "just happened to <b>fit</b> <b>perfectly</b> into the 'us vs. Paul' mindset" [...] following the Beatles' break-up, {{to the extent that}} [...] "Back Off Boogaloo" [...] was [...] "as damning as 'Early 1970' had been conciliatory". When tailoring his 1970 composition [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] for Starr to record on the album Ringo (1973), Lennon referenced the song title with the lines [...] "Now I'm only thirty-two / And all I want to do is boogaloo".|$|E

500|$|Ed Park {{singled out}} the author's prose for praise, proclaiming that [...] "entence for sentence, few authors equal Gibson's {{gift for the}} terse yet poetic description, the quotable simile – people and {{products}} are nailed down with a beautiful precision approximating the platonic ideal of the catalog". Matt Thorne noted that while he found Gibson's tendency towards hyper-specificity initially irritating, [...] "there's hypnotic quality to the relentless cataloguing". The author's prose was also extolled by Clay Evans of the Daily Camera, and by Benjamin Lytal in The New York Sun, who declared that [...] "the real news, in Spook Country, is {{that much of the}} flair that Mr. Gibson once brought to descriptions of cyberspace seems to <b>fit</b> <b>perfectly,</b> now, on all kinds of things." [...] In The Seattle Times, Nisi Shawl gushed that [...] "ven without the high cool quotient of the novel's contents, the pleasure of Gibson's prose would be enough inducement for most of us to immerse ourselves in this book...." [...] Simon Cooper of The Book Show agreed with the commendations of Gibson's prose, but felt the plot and characterization let the book down: ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{attracted}} widespread praise {{by music}} critics, {{many of whom}} ranked it among West's best songs. [...] Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal compared elements of the song to the rock band The Strokes, and stated that it contained {{some of the best}} lyrics ever written by West. Dan Vidal of URB largely praised the track, writing that it was an excellent song overall, though wrote that [...] "in my personal opinion, I don’t really think Kid Cudi can sing; and I’m not sure why his generally off-key caterwauling is appealing to people, but here it’s hypnotically on point – matching perfectly with the track’s imposing tone." [...] MTV wrote that the song featured West at his most boastful lyrically, musing that [...] "while his lyrics are razor sharp, the production here is softer, resulting in a melodic finger wag to his naysayers rather than searing jabs." [...] David Amidon of PopMatters praised the performance by West on the song but felt that neither guest appearance ultimately left much of an impression. On the other hand, Sputnikmusic's Channing Freeman felt that both Cudi and Raekwon <b>fit</b> <b>perfectly</b> on the guitar-driven track.|$|E
500|$|Matos Michaelangelo of The A.V. Club {{remarked that}} [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] has [...] "boilerplate lyrics" [...] that would <b>fit</b> <b>perfectly</b> in a Hayley Mills film. Nick Levine of Digital Spy {{wrote in his}} review of the album that [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] has the [...] "most {{interesting}} lyrics" [...] of the entire record. In a separate review of [...] "If I Were a Boy", Levine awarded it four stars out of five, writing that Beyoncé's vocals on the song are passionate. He praised the lyrics for not being overwritten and commended their [...] "emotional punch" [...] and [...] "very strong melody" [...] which he said can make people {{feel that they have}} always known the song. Pitchfork Media's Ryan Dombal called [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] an [...] "effective and affecting gender-bender". Allmusic writer Andy Kellman felt that though the ballad sounds like [...] "the watery backdrop for a singing competition finale", it is the most outstanding song on I Am... Sasha Fierce thanks to its lyrics and Beyoncé's tormented performance. Colin McGuire of PopMatters felt that [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] was the highlight of the first disc of the double album.|$|E

500|$|After the new {{specimens}} were announced, it was rumoured that a looted skull {{had found}} its way to a European museum through the black market. The poached elements were spotted in a private European collection by the French fossil trader François Escuillé, who notified Belgian palaeontologist Pascal Godefroit about them in 2011. They suspected the remains belonged to Deinocheirus, and contacted the Korean-Mongolian team. Escuillé subsequently acquired the fossils and donated them to the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences. The recovered material consisted of a skull, a left hand, and feet, which had been collected in Mongolia, sold to a Japanese buyer, and resold to a German party. The team concluded that these elements belonged to specimen MPC-D 100/127, as the single leftover toe bone <b>fit</b> <b>perfectly</b> into the unprepared matrix of a poached foot, the bone and matrix matched in colour, and because the elements belonged to an individual of the same size, with no overlap in skeletal elements. On May 1, 2014, the fossils were repatriated to Mongolia by a delegation from the Belgian Museum, during a ceremony held at the Mongolian Academy of Sciences. The reunited skeleton was deposited at the Central Museum of Mongolian Dinosaurs in Ulaanbaatar, along with a Tarbosaurus skeleton which had also been brought back after being stolen. American palaeontologist Thomas R. Holtz stated in an interview that the new Deinocheirus remains looked like the [...] "product of a secret love affair between a hadrosaur and Gallimimus".|$|E
500|$|R. C. Kamalakannan was the VFX {{producer}} of this film. Magadheera {{was the first}} Telugu film in which the position of [...] "Visual Effects Producer" [...] {{was used in the}} credits. He was assisted by a team of five experts from abroad and a 62 dedicated group members apart from 130 people from the company EFX in Chennai and Hyderabad. Special effects and CG was used for about 1 hour and 40 minutes out of the total 2 hours and 35 minutes in the film. 15% of the frames in the film's scenes of Udayghad city were actually shot with a camera; the rest were CG extension. For the scenes in the stadium, CG extension was slightly above 50%. For the stadium, Italian concept artist Marco Rolandi began with a CAD drawing and made his first 3D concept in 5 days. It took five months for Marco to reach the design shown in the film and as imagined by Rajamouli. Simultaneously, Iranian 3D technical director Adel Adili, who worked with Kamalakannan for Anji (2004), Yamadonga and Arundathi (2009), was working on the 3D Udayghad city. He started with a city-plan and added streets, buildings, mountains, temples, palaces, water bodies, a huge waterfall, rivers, gates, a moat and trees, all of which were planned and received Rajamouli's approval before being executed to full scale. Adili redesigned Marco's 3D stadium to suit Indian aesthetics and made it <b>fit</b> <b>perfectly</b> within the city.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews. IGN contributor Robert Canning praised [...] "The Funcooker" [...] {{writing that}} it was fantastic and [...] "never felt like a moment was wasted or that a scene was extraneous." [...] He enjoyed all the storylines in the episode, writing they were interesting and funny enough, and complimented the way they all tied together with such ease. Canning enjoyed Tracy's actions writing that they <b>fit</b> <b>perfectly</b> for the Tracy character, and gave the episode a 9.6 out of 10 rating. [...] "Holy normalsauce, did I ever love this episode", wrote Entertainment Weeklys Margaret Lyons. Her only complaint about this episode was Scott Adsit's absence. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad was grateful that the episode focused on NBC, TGS, {{and the work of}} the staff. Sassone wrote that despite [...] "The Funcooker" [...] not being [...] "the most laugh-out-loud episode" [...] he believed it was still funny. The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin praised Jackie Hoffman's performance, noting that her monologue in court was brilliant. He enjoyed all of the episode's storylines, except for Tracy's, which he opined fell flat. In conclusion, Rabin gave this episode a B+ rating. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall wrote that an episode like [...] "The Funcooker" [...] is [...] "really instructive about why a lot of other shows... haven't quite worked. Even when they have lots of funny things in them, they never really build to a climax in the way that this one did, as everything went wrong at once." [...] Sepinwall enjoyed Tina Fey's Liz in the episode, noting that her craziness worked well, but his concern was that when Liz loses it [...] "there's nobody sane for her to push against." ...|$|E

500|$|Lynch as Sue {{received}} {{high praise}} for her acting. Canning wrote that she [...] "stole the episode" [...] and [...] "perfectly portrayed a woman [...] hard heart was trying terribly not to break, but {{not being able}} to stop it." [...] BuddyTV John Kubicek stated, [...] "it's impossible for me to say that Lynch wasn't exceptional, because her slow breakdown and attempt to cover-up her emotions was well done and <b>fit</b> <b>perfectly</b> with the character." [...] Respers France commented that [...] "we got to see the range and complexity of Sue Sylvester", and Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly said that Lynch did an [...] "outstanding job of delivering even the funniest quips with an underlying sense of sadness". Sue's characterization in the series was criticized by several reviewers, however. Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times stated that the [...] "consistent inconsistency of Sue's character is wearing thin", and that [...] "our sense of her fails to advance, wandering endlessly between pure evil and pure love for her sister." [...] Futterman called the episode a [...] "too-little-too late attempt at redemption for Sue's poor characterization this season." [...] VanDerWerff wrote that the episode [...] "feels very self-consciously like a way to just remove her character from the table for the season finale", that [...] "it feels very self-consciously like an attempt by the show to address the fact that the character doesn't make any sense", and criticized the death of Jean: [...] "killing her solely to right a wayward character arc is lazy writing, and no amount of actor commitment can wholly save it." [...] Fallon described the funeral plot line as [...] "pure, classic Glee: Egregiously random, emotionally manipulative, wholly unnecessary to plot development, and, in the end, deeply moving." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{the final}} version of [...] "Part Two" [...] is quite enclosed, the initial script was {{considered}} epic, with production designer Jerry Wanek jokingly referring to it as a [...] "six-hour mini-series". In the original version, the giant devil's trap keeping demons away from the gateway to Hell was much more complex, with each point in the pentagram being a church housing a holy relic—such as a sliver from the True Cross. With the artifacts powering the devil's trap, Jake's role would have been to go to each church and destroy them, the hunters following after him to try to stop him. Jake would then eventually destroy the final relic during a fight with Sam, and Dean would race to the gateway to prevent Azazel from opening it while Jake and Sam are [...] "beating the crap out of each other". However, when director and executive producer Kim Manners received the script, he realized it was huge, and had the storyboard artist make five-and-a-half hours of storyboards for the episode to prove that it could not be filmed without going {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} over-budget. Production suggested that a large amount of money could be saved by not depicting the churches, which were major set pieces for the intended story. Kripke realized that instead of using churches, he could have the points of the pentagram be connected by railroad tracks. With tracks being made of iron, it <b>fit</b> <b>perfectly</b> with the series mythology because iron is a demon deterrent. Kripke found this aspect to be more Western, matching the tone of show. Rather than destroying the devil's trap as in the original script, Jake is instead sent by Azazel to open the gateway himself, and the major fight scene between Jake and Sam was then changed into a standoff between Jake and the hunters. Though the storyline had to be toned down, Kripke felt that this improved the overall episode by making it simpler.|$|E
