5|$|As part of baseball's {{expansion}} in the early 1960s, a franchise was awarded to New York, {{to play in the}} National League beginning in 1962, and {{to be known as the}} New York Mets. It was hoped that the new team would be supported by the many former Giant and Dodger fans left without a team when the franchises moved to California after the 1957 season. There were rumors through the 1961 season that Stengel would be the manager, but he initially showed no interest in managing a team that, given the rules for the expansion draft, was unlikely to be competitive. George Weiss had been forced out as Yankee general manager and hired by the Mets. He wanted Stengel as manager, and after talks with the Mets principal owners, Joan Whitney Payson and M. Donald Grant, Stengel was introduced as Mets manager at a press conference on October 2, 1961. Leonard Koppett of The New York Times suggested that Stengel took the job to <b>give</b> <b>something</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the game that had been his life for half a century.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Much {{environmental}} health research depends on human volunteers participating with biological samples. The perception study explores {{why and how}} people participate in a placenta perfusion study in Copenhagen. The participation implies donation of the placenta after birth and some background information but no follow up. Methods Nineteen semi-structured qualitative {{interviews were conducted with}} participants in the placenta perfusion study after donation of placenta. Observation studies were made of recruitment sessions. Results The interviewed participants are generally in favour of medical research. They participated in the placenta perfusion study due to a belief that societal progress follows medical research. They also felt that participating was a way of <b>giving</b> <b>something</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Danish health care system. The participants have trust in medical science and scientists, but trust is something which needs to be created through "trust-work". Face-to-face interaction, written information material and informed consent forms play important parts in creating trusting relationships in medical research. Conclusion Medical research ethics do not only amount to specific types of written information material but should also be seen as a number of trust making performances involving researchers as well as research participants. </p...|$|R
40|$|Rurality {{and rural}} {{population}} issues require consideration when conducting and reporting on rural health research. A first article {{focused on the}} planning stage of the research. The objective {{of this article is}} to explore conducting and reporting issues that require attention when undertaking rural health research. The privacy of participants, the collection of data, the cultural traditions of Indigenous communities, the dissemination of results, and <b>giving</b> <b>something</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the community, are all aspects of conducting and reporting rural health research that require attention. Procedures such as identifying the characteristics of the population, attention to safety issues when collecting data, the use of local liaison persons and acknowledging the ownership of intellectual property, increase the quality of the research outcomes. They are issues that are relevant to both qualitative and quantitative research methods. Procedures are available to address issues of particular concern in developing appropriate methods for rural health research. While we have concentrated on Australian issues, and possible solutions, rural localities in many other countries may face similar issues. In any rural setting, paying attention to issues that may affect the conducting and reporting of rural health research will hopefully result in studies that support the continued improvement of health in rural communities.
