The present paper gives a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of anidolic <b>integrated</b> <b>ceiling.</b> This device was designed with regard of luminous climate of the city of Biskra (Algeria), installed in the north façade and their luminous performance is assessed experimentally by using scale model, for a 12 m deep room. The results of this experimental analysis have shown that the Anidolic <b>Integrated</b> <b>Ceiling</b> offers a great potential for increasing the illuminance level in deep-plan building under hot and dry regions (intermediate sky conditions). In addition, the spherical image shown that the integration of this system provides a good ambiances result by uniform luminance distribution throughout the room which produces a visual satisfaction compared to the reference model...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to demonstrate, according to subjective and objective evaluations, that a passive Anidolic <b>Integrated</b> <b>Ceiling</b> (AIC) is able to provide an adequate illumination level for optimal visual and task performance in deeper office spaces and to prove its effectiveness in enhancing interior daylighting quality. A quantitative study was performed by calculating the D. GI. P from spherical images in an office room, while a qualitative evaluation was achieved by using questionnaire survey. Experimental results confirmed that the AIC significantly improves luminous comfort by providing a uniform luminance distribution throughout space. Responses obtained from 62 subjects show that 64. 51 % of participants were satisfied with their daylighting. In addition, ANOVA test results showed that there is a significant correlation between quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the interior daylight distribution...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the performance evaluation and design optimization of a ceiling ventilation system with integrated solar photovoltaic thermal (PVT) collectors and phase change materials (PCMs) {{by using a}} hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization and Hooke-Jeeves Pattern search (PSO-HJ) algorithm. In this novel ceiling ventilation system, the PVT collectors are used to generate electricity and provide the low-grade heating energy for buildings by using the winter daytime solar radiation, while the PCM is integrated into the building ceiling {{as part of the}} ceiling insulation and at the same time, as a centralized thermal energy storage unit to temporally store the low-grade thermal energy collected from the PVT collectors and use it later when needed. The benefit of using this proposed PVT-PCM <b>integrated</b> <b>ceiling</b> ventilation system in active buildings with air-conditioning systems was evaluated in terms of the total power consumption of the house for space heating. Further optimization was performed in order to identify the optimal values of the key design parameters. In the hybrid PSO-HJ algorithm used in the design optimization, the PSO is first used to identify the optimal region of the design variables while the HJ algorithm is then used to perform a local search to identify the 2 ̆ 2 global 2 ̆ 2 optimal values. The results showed that the integration of PVT collectors and PCMs with the ceiling ventilation can greatly reduce the power consumption of the house for space heating in winter. By employing the optimal design identified using PSO-HJ algorithm, the power consumption of the house can be further reduced...|$|E

50|$|By {{the late}} 1990s the Oklahoma City Airport Trust deemed the 1967-built {{terminal}} building unsuitable. Following {{the adoption of}} a three phase master plan, preparations for renovating the airport were launched in 2001.

40|$|In this {{two year}} program, UDC {{together}} with Armstrong World Industries, Professor Stephen Forrest (University of Michigan) and Professor Mark Thompson (University of Southern California) planned {{to develop and}} deliver high efficiency OLED lighting luminaires {{as part of an}} <b>integrated</b> <b>ceiling</b> illumination system that exceed the Department of Energy (DOE) 2010 performance projections. Specifically the UDC team in 2010 delivered two prototype OLED ceiling illumination systems, each consisting of four individual OLED lighting panels on glass integrated into Armstrong's novel TechZone open architecture ceiling systems, at an overall system efficacy of 51 lm/W, a CRI = 85 and a projected lifetime to 70 % of initial luminance to exceed 10, 000 hours. This accomplishment represents a 50 % increase in luminaire efficacy and a factor of two in lifetime over that outlined in the solicitation. In addition, the team has also delivered one 15 cm x 15 cm lighting panel fabricated on a flexible metal foil substrate, demonstrating the possibility using OLEDs in a range of form factors. During this program, our Team has pursued the commercialization of these OLED based ceiling luminaires, with a goal to launch commercial products within the next three years. We have proven that our team is ideally suited to develop these highly novel and efficient solid state lighting luminaires, having both the technical experience and commercial strategy to leverage work performed under this contract. Our calculations show that the success of our program could lead to energy savings of more than 0. 5 quads or 8 MMTC (million metric tons of carbon) per year by 2016...|$|E
40|$|Dedicated {{outdoor air}} systems (DOAS) <b>integrated</b> with <b>ceiling</b> radiant cooling panels as a {{parallel}} sensible cooling system are being considered {{as an alternative}} to conventional variable air volume (VAV) systems for commercial buildings because of their energy conservation, first and operating costs, and indoor air quality advantages. A pilot DOAS/radiant panel cooling system is being constructed on a university campus to investigate its advantages over alternative cooling systems in a real application. Prior to the actual operation of the pilot system, the energy conservation potential of the DOAS/radiant cooling panel system relative to a VAV system with air-side economizer control was estimated. Hourly energy simulation predicts that the annual electrical energy consumption of the pilot DOAS/radiant panel cooling system is 42 % less than that of the conventional VAV system with air-side economizer...|$|R

40|$|The {{interior}} insulation {{can cause}} mould problems, especially with inappropriate workmanship. Here above all three causes {{are to be}} noted, the convective flow with indoor air at the backside of the insulation, gaps in the insulation system and the thermal bridge effect within adjacent walls or ceilings. With hygrothermal calculations it is shown that the convective flow and gaps are absolutely to be avoided. The presence of interior insulation {{does not lead to}} a critical situation in the contact zone to the <b>integrating</b> wall or <b>ceiling</b> because here the thermal bridge to the warm side leads to a higher temperature and thus a lower humidity...|$|R

Most noticeable is the curved stairway to the upper deck and a more spacious main passenger entrance. The 747-8's main cabin uses an interior {{similar to that of}} the 787. Overhead bins are curved, and the center row is designed to look as though it is attached to the curved <b>ceiling,</b> rather than <b>integrated</b> into the <b>ceiling's</b> curve like on the 777. The windows are also of similar size to the type used on the 777, which are 8% larger than those on the current 747-400s. The 747-8 features a new solid-state light-emitting diode (LED) lighting system, which can create mood lighting.|$|R
50|$|As {{with all}} Prairie houses, Wright {{designed}} the light fixtures for the Robie House. Throughout the house, wall sconces {{can be found}} in the shape of a hemispherical shade suspended beneath a square bronze fixture. On the second floor living and dining rooms, spherical globes within wooden squares are <b>integrated</b> into the <b>ceiling</b> trim, further tying the two spaces together visually. Soffit lighting running the length of the north and south sides of the living and dining rooms, as well as soffit lighting in the prows of the living and dining rooms, are covered with Wright-designed wooden grilles, backed with translucent colored glass diffusers. Because these lights are all independently operable, different effects can be created within these spaces. Finally, a Wright-designed table lamp with an art glass shade stood on a Wright-designed library table in the living room.|$|R
40|$|Moving air cools human body.   In warm environments, {{fans can}} provide comfort using less energy than air-conditioning. The savings in HVAC energy is substantial, and greater if fans enable {{buildings}} to be successfully conditioned by natural ventilation or evaporative cooling systems, instead of chillers. Although {{there are many}} laboratory studies for desk fans and personalized fans, the tests for ceiling fans are rare, mainly from early studies in 1980 s.   The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine cooling effect of an <b>integrated</b> low-wattage <b>ceiling</b> fan on people in warm environments when air comes from different directions with different speeds.   We conducted 96 human subject tests in an environmental chamber.   Sixteen college students each experienced 6 air movement conditions: two different air speeds and three different air directions from the fan toward the subject-from front, side, or right above the head. The difference in thermal comfort and thermal sensation generated by fixed and oscillating fans was also investigated. The temperature and humidity conditions for the tests were 28 °C and 50 % RH. The two air velocities were selected based on previous experiments conducted with human subjects in our environmental chamber. The two hour test schedule included two five minute breaks when subjects were asked to be away from the fans, simulating conditions in real offices when people are away from fans.   Subjective responses about thermal sensation, comfort, temperature satisfaction, perceived air quality, and preferred air movement were obtained periodically during the test, including the break periods. The results show that the ceiling fan is capable of providing thermal comfort under the tested warm condition. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} the first results of {{experimental}} research are described, {{which began in}} the 2006 summer season and is still underway, on the performance of a primary air system <b>integrated</b> with radiant <b>ceiling</b> panels that runs in the hospital rooms in the maternity ward of the Maggiore Hospital of Bologna. The choice of this kind of environment is based {{the fact that there is}} more and more attention toward literature on comfort standards that must be guaranteed in the hospital environment, due to the presence of typically weak users, both from the clinical and psychological point of view. The performance of the air conditioning system is taken into account in relation to the conditions of comfort the patients feel, provided that the validity of the results is also extendible to environments with different purposes of use, both for civil and industrial applications. The experimental activity was conducted with the use of temperature micro-recorders installed on all the bordering surfaces of the sample environment; the positioning of the sensors was defined via thermo-graphic surveys. Always via the use of temperature and relative humidity micro-recorders, thermo-hygrometric values of the environment and of the primary air were monitored as well. The values of the thermal power given by the panels were calculated with an ultrasound appliance to record the capacities of the thermal carrier fluid...|$|R
40|$|Supply air {{flowrate}} {{and supply}} air temperature can be varied to maintain the room tempera-ture setpoint according to the air temperature conditions outdoors and heating loads indoors. Increasing the {{supply air temperature}} and decreasing supply air flowrate can reduce energy consumption, however it causes insufficient air circulation and thus leads to low indoor air quality risk. Increasing the supply airflow will improve air circulation and mixing effective-ness within the room, {{but it will also}} increase energy consumption (Choa et. al., 2010), so {{there is a need to}} find an optimal correlation between air mixing effectiveness and energy ef-ficiency. The objective of this study was to identify the correlation between the minimum airflow and supply air temperature that would maintain a satisfactory thermal comfort in the human’s oc-cupancy zone when introducing warm air into the room. The study was conducted in the full-scale test chamber that represented a typical single office room. 24 air velocity and tempera-ture measuring probes were positioned in different levels and locations of human’s occupancy zone. Supply air diffuser prototype with a perforated faceplate was <b>integrated</b> into the <b>ceiling</b> and tested to see how the warm air is distributed within the test chamber. Numerous supply air temperature and flowrate variations were analysed during the study:  to see, how does each variation affect the air distribution pattern;  to find the best matching supply air temperature and flowrate balance to prevent the risk of air mass stratification and thus to ensure a good indoor air quality...|$|R
40|$|In {{my thesis}} I treat {{one of the}} {{possibilities}} of latent heat storage. I have used the phase-change materials (PCM), which are apropriate {{to be built in}} passive solar systems. When PCM are changing their phase from liquid to solid state or vice versa, they absorb or emit the heat at constant temperature. Therefore they can be used as stabilisers of temperature and during summer they can prevent the overheating of buildings. I present exisiting and tested construction complexes with different PCM systems that are <b>integrated</b> in walls, <b>ceilings</b> and floors. For the chosen example of modular facade system the most fitting position of PCM layer in the construction element is determined, based on calculated time of PCM melting. Estimated time of melting is determined with simplified Stefan or moving boundary problem. This goes for the case, where at the beginning the whole layer of PCM is in solid phase in thermal balance at temperature of phase change. Later, when the temperature at the surface of constructon complex is raised, the PCM starts melting. Firstly the outer surface melts and then the phase front, which seperates the areas of solid and liquid PCM, starts moving to the inside of PCM. Considering the summer temperature conditions, between three commercially accessible PCM the one with the most optimal temperature of phase transition was chosen, to ensure the heat comfort in the room. The analysis shows, that among tested PCMs, the most optimal slowdown of the response of the construction element on the temperature changes of the environment is, when using the layer of PCM with the temperature of phase transition around 21 °C on the internal side of construction element. With high external and internal temperatures the melting of the chosen PCM is slow enough in order to maintain constant temperature of internal wall surface...|$|R
