It is important to have enough of it, but having lots and lots <b>does</b> not <b>buy</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> much", large-scale longitudinal studies indicate an increase in IQ translates into an increase in performance at all levels of IQ: i.e. ability and job performance are monotonically linked at all IQ levels.

40|$|Wh {{questions}} with multiple wh elements pose a special problem within the overall analysis of wh-type constructions. In a language like English, which only allows one wh element {{to be in}} the fronted discourse-prominent position, any additional wh element occupies an “in situ ” position; i. e. the position of the clause-internal grammatical function. 1 As noted at least since Kuno and Robinson (1972), the choice of which wh element is fronted is not free. They cite examples such as the following: (1) a. Who did what? b. Who went where? c. What happened to whom? d. What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> give to whom? (2) a. *What did who do? b. *Where did who go? c. *To whom did what happen? d. *To whom <b>did</b> <b>you</b> give what? / *Who <b>did</b> <b>you</b> give what to? A similar effect obtains in (a subset of) languages which front multiple wh elements, as seen in the following examples from Bulgarian (Bošković 2002 : 354). (3) a. Koj kogo običa? who whom loves ‘Who loves whom?’ b. *Kogo koj običa? whom who loves Expressing the constraint in movement terms, Kuno and Robinson state that a wh element cannot cross over another wh element. Stated this way, the constraint seems rather arbitrary. It becomes even more arbitrary when compared with cases such as the following: (4) a. Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> what? / What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> where? b. When <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> what? / What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> when...|$|R

40|$|Consider the {{following}} utterances: (a) “Hey Dan, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> this [pointing to a cap] at the game?” (b) “Hey Dan, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> this [pointing to a cap] at a game?” Both of these sentences display the three basic types of defi-nite references—the proper noun Dan, the deictic referent this (pointing to a cap {{that both the}} speaker and the listener can see), and anaphora (you and the game). The sentences differ linguistically only {{in their use of}} two small words: the and a, but this difference confers a critical difference in meaning. The use in (a) of the definite article (the game), unlike the use in (b) of an indefinite article (a game), indicates that the speaker has in mind a particular referent that he or she believes the listener can uniquely identify from among other possibili...|$|R

40|$|Many {{decisions}} {{in the lives of}} animals and humans require a fine balance between the exploration of different options and the exploitation of their rewards. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>buy</b> the advertised car, or <b>do</b> <b>you</b> test drive different models? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> continue feeding from the current patch of flowers, or <b>do</b> <b>you</b> fly off to another one? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> marry your current partner, or try your luck with someone else? The balance required in these situations is commonly referred to as the exploration – exploitation tradeoff. It features prominently {{in a wide range of}} research traditions, including learning, foraging, and decision making literatures. Here, we integrate findings from these and other often-isolated literatures in order to gain a better understand-ing of the possible tradeoffs between exploration and exploitation, and we propose new theoretical insights that might guide future research. Specifically, we explore how potential tradeoffs depend on (a) the conceptualization of exploration and exploitation; (b) the influencing environmental, social, and individual factors; (c) the scale at which exploration and exploitation are considered; (d) the relationshi...|$|R
