Milton died in his sleep on April 3, 1917, at the age of 88. Up until his death, Milton <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> active, preoccupied with reading, writing articles for religious publications and enjoying his morning walks. He had also marched in a Dayton Woman's Suffrage Parade, along with Orville and Katharine.|$|E
5|$|Imported beer <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> {{expensive}} {{during the}} initial gold rush, costing around $100 a barrel, or approximately $1 a bottle. The Dawson City Brewery had been established in the city by a businessman called T. Krozner in 1898 to manufacture a local alternative, but this had closed by 1902 as the city's population declined and prices fell.|$|E

5|$|Just {{before the}} capture of Jerusalem, the British War Office <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> worried about Allenby's {{extended}} advance and warned of a possible retirement back to Gaza and Beersheba if the war on the Western Front dictated the transfer {{of large numbers of}} troops from the Levant.

5|$|Middleton {{stayed at}} LSU until 1942, {{describing}} {{his days as}} the comptroller of LSU as long days {{that he would not}} want to relive, but after the first year he found both the work and his association with Hebert, Borth and Hornbeak to be satisfying and rewarding. He felt that during this period of time, from 1939 to 1941, he was able to make his greatest contribution to an institution that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> good to him in the past.|$|E

5|$|The {{chain of}} {{events leading up to}} Bishop Tempier's {{condemnation}} of 1277 is still not entirely clear. The Catholic Encyclopedia records that the theologians of the University of Paris <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> uneasy due to the antagonism that existed between Christian dogmas and certain Peripatetic doctrines.

Three species of sea anemone they discovered were named for them by Dr. Oscar Calgren at the Lund University's Department of Zoology in Sweden: Palythoa rickettsii, Isometridium rickettsi, and Phialoba steinbecki.|$|E
5|$|Biden's father <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> well-off {{earlier in}} his life, but {{suffered}} several business reversals {{by the time his}} son was born. For several years, the family had to live with Biden's maternal grandparents, the Finnegans. When the Scranton area went into economic decline during the 1950s, Biden's father could not find enough work. In 1953, the Biden family moved to an apartment in Claymont, Delaware, where they lived for a few years before moving to a house in Wilmington, Delaware. Joe Biden Sr. was then more successful as a used car salesman, and the family's circumstances were middle class.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his public}} nonchalance, Seward was devastated by his {{convention}} loss, as were {{many of his}} supporters. The New Yorker was the best-known and most popular Republican, and his defeat shocked many in the North, who felt that Lincoln had been nominated through chicanery. Although Seward sent a letter stating Weed was not to blame, Seward's political manager took the defeat hard. Seward was initially inclined to retire from public life, but received many letters from supporters: distrustful of Lincoln, they urged Seward to remain involved in politics. On his way to Washington to return to Senate duties, he stopped in Albany to confer with Weed, {{who had gone to}} Lincoln's home in Springfield, Illinois to meet with the candidate, and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> impressed at Lincoln's political understanding. At the Capitol, Seward received sympathy even from sectional foes such as Jefferson Davis.|$|E

5|$|Editor Vanessa Whitburn told Chris Arnot of The Independent {{that the}} climax to the storyline was planned three {{months prior to}} the show's anniversary. When Ruth listened to a {{voicemail}} from her daughter, it reminded her of home and she called Sam to say she could not be with him. Ruth then turned to Usha for support, before returning home to David, who observed Ruth's emotional state. After Sam quit his job, Ruth eventually told David the truth about what happened. Bentinck explained that when he and Finch finished recording the scene, they were both crying as it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> distressing. David was initially unable to forgive Ruth for her actions, but after speaking to Usha and gaining some perspective, over time things between himself and Ruth became easier.|$|E
5|$|Escher, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> fond of and {{inspired}} by the landscapes in Italy, was decidedly unhappy in Switzerland. In 1937, the family moved again, to Uccle (Ukkel), a suburb of Brussels, Belgium. World War II forced them to move in January 1941, this time to Baarn, Netherlands, where Escher lived until 1970. Most of Escher's best-known works date from this period. The sometimes cloudy, cold and wet weather of the Netherlands allowed him to focus intently on his work. After 1953, Escher lectured widely. A planned series of lectures in North America in 1962 was cancelled after an illness, and he stopped creating artworks for a time, but the illustrations and text for the lectures were later published {{as part of the}} book Escher on Escher. He was awarded the Knighthood of the Order of Orange-Nassau in 1955.|$|E
5|$|The Washington Huskies had outscored {{their opponents}} 20337 {{during the regular}} season, {{excluding}} the games against New York and Mississippi. Washington's running backs, George Wilson and Elmer Tesreau, led their offense during the season, each gaining several hundred rushing yards. However, Tesreau was suffering from boils on his knee, and his coaches urged him to not play in the Rose Bowl. The Washington defense was considered superior to that of Navy, being much larger on average. Washington's defense <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> effective during the regular season, holding five teams scoreless and allowing more than ten points to be scored against them only once. Washington's special teams {{were considered to be}} average.|$|E

5|$|The territory's {{contribution}} to the British cause during World War I <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> large in proportion to its white population, though troops had been mostly raised from scratch as {{there had been no}} professional standing army beforehand. Since the start of self-government in 1923, the colony had organised the all-white Rhodesia Regiment into a permanent defence force, complemented locally by the partly paramilitary British South Africa Police (BSAP). The Rhodesia Regiment comprised about 3,000 men, including reserves, in 1938. The country had fielded black troops during World War I, but since then had retained them only within the BSAP. A nucleus of airmen existed {{in the form of the}} Southern Rhodesian Air Force (SRAF), which in August 1939 comprised one squadron of 10 pilots and eight Hawker Hardy aircraft, based at Belvedere Airport near the capital Salisbury.|$|E
5|$|During 19 April, {{the fourth}} day, the 1st Belorussian Front {{broke through the}} final line of the Seelow Heights; and nothing but broken German {{formations}} lay between them and Berlin. The 1st Ukrainian Front, having captured Forst the day before, was fanning out into open country. One powerful thrust by Gordov's 3rd Guards Army and Rybalko's 3rd and Lelyushenko's 4th Guards Tank Armies were heading north-east towards Berlin while other armies headed west towards {{a section of the}} United States Army's front line south-west of Berlin on the Elbe. With these advances, the Soviet forces drove a wedge between the German Army Group Vistula in the north and Army Group Centre in the south. By the end of the day, the German eastern front line north of Frankfurt around Seelow and to the south around Forst had ceased to exist. These breakthroughs allowed the two Soviet Fronts to envelop the German 9th Army in a large pocket west of Frankfurt. Attempts by the 9th Army to break out to the west resulted in the Battle of Halbe. The cost to the Soviet forces <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> high, with over 2,807 tanks lost between 1 and 19 April, including at least 727 at the Seelow Heights.|$|E
5|$|Even after Balliol's accession, Edward still {{continued}} to assert his authority over Scotland. Against {{the objections of}} the Scots, he agreed to hear appeals on cases ruled on by the court of guardians that had governed Scotland during the interregnum. A further provocation came in a case brought by Macduff, son of Malcolm, Earl of Fife, in which Edward demanded that Balliol appear in person before the English Parliament to answer the charges. This the Scottish King did, but the final straw was Edward's demand that the Scottish magnates provide military service {{in the war against}} France. This was unacceptable; the Scots instead formed an alliance with France and launched an unsuccessful attack on Carlisle. Edward responded by invading Scotland in 1296 and taking the town of Berwick in a particularly bloody attack. At the Battle of Dunbar, Scottish resistance was effectively crushed. Edward confiscated the Stone of Destiny – the Scottish coronation stoneand brought it to Westminster placing it in what became known as King Edward's Chair; he deposed Balliol and placed him in the Tower of London, and installed Englishmen to govern the country. The campaign <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>very</b> successful, but the English triumph would only be temporary.|$|E
