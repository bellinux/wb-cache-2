5000|$|Pa Chai was {{a leader}} of the Hmong in the early twentieth century. He was seen as the [...] "Chao Fa" [...] of the Hmong people before Shong Lue Yang, {{although}} his power was not as far-reaching. He {{was a leader}} in the movement against the French colonial empire, and one day, he was taken to the [...] "Lord of the Sky and the Earth," [...] known in Hmong as Lu Ndu Lu Te. He received a mandate to lead the Hmong people to change their way of life and develop a new writing system, and it is said that after he returned, he displayed magical powers. These manifested in the form of two years of successful resistance against the French. Apparently, although Pa Chai had instructed his people not to attack the Lao, they did, and this caused him to lose his supposed mandate, which caused the Hmong to begin losing, and in due course, in 1921, he was killed, ending the [...] "War of the Insane", as it was known to the French. As Shong Lue was the next [...] "Chao Fa," [...] this alleged militant intention constantly hung over Shong Lue's head, which contributed to the acceleration of Shong Lue's defamation, mystery, and assassination.

40|$|In the UK, Singapore, Canada, New Zealand and Australia, as in {{many other}} jurisdictions, charity law is rooted in the common law and {{anchored}} on the Statute of Charitable Uses 1601. The Pemsel classification of charitable purposes was uniformly accepted, and together with a shared and growing pool of judicial precedents, aided by the ‘spirit and intendment’ rule, has subsequently allowed the law to develop along much the same lines. In recent years, all the above jurisdictions have embarked on law reform processes designed to strengthen regulatory processes and to statutorily define and <b>encode</b> common <b>law</b> concepts. The reform outcomes are now to be found in a batch of national charity statutes which reflect interesting differences in the extent to which their respective governments have been prepared to balance the modernising of charitable purposes and other common law concepts alongside the customary concern to tighten the regulatory framework...|$|R

40|$|Maximum-entropy {{ensembles}} are key primitives in {{statistical mechanics}} from which thermodynamic properties can be derived. Over the decades, several approaches {{have been put}} forward {{in order to justify}} from minimal assumptions the use of these ensembles in statistical descriptions. However, there is still no full consensus on the precise reasoning justifying the use of such ensembles. In this work, we provide a new approach to derive maximum-entropy ensembles taking a strictly operational perspective. We investigate the set of possible transitions that a system can undergo together with an environment, when one only has partial information about both the system and its environment. The set of all these allowed transitions <b>encodes</b> thermodynamic <b>laws</b> and limitations on thermodynamic tasks as particular cases. Our main result is that the set of allowed transitions coincides with the one possible if both system and environment were assigned the maximum entropy state compatible with the partial information. This justifies the overwhelming success of such ensembles and provides a derivation without relying on considerations of typicality or information-theoretic measures.

Knowledge management {{is dealing with the}} problem of different languages in big countries. Also knowledge is present in different forms. It may be knowledge <b>encoded</b> in <b>laws,</b> decrees, standards, policies, rules and regulations and orders. All these forms of knowledge must be combined together so that it is readily available for general public in their own language. In addition there should be a proper knowledge propagation mechanism. Knowledge propagation becomes difficult in multiple languages. Recently mobile phones and in car computers have become widely used in third world country.

This study proposes a framework for knowledge propagation through voiceXML in different languages using Mobile phone or in car pc as the delivery medium.

Traditional approaches typically use feedback information on the buffer level in designing the control policy.

By setting up this problem as a Markov decision process, we show that using information on the state (activity) of the sources, in addition to the buffer level, can result in significant improvements over traditional approaches. We demonstrate this for a multiplexer fed by [...] <b>law</b> <b>encoded</b> voice sources. Some of the scenarios we study exhibit a reduction in distortion exceeding 35 %. In general, the improvement is heavily dependent on the correlation statistics of the sources. Emulations validate the analysis.

Piking the stick meant placing the hand though the yarnsheet, and unclipping two sticks of underclearer rollers from beneath the drafting rollers, drawing them through the 1 ¼ in gap between two ends, stripping them of fly and replacing them on the next inward run. Cleaning the carriage top was far more dangerous. The minder would stop the mule on the outward run, and raise his hands above his head.

We show how the encoding can be used to reason about UTP theories and their predicates, including models of particular specifications and programs. We support encoding and reasoning about combinations of predicates of various theory instantiations, as typically found in UTP models.
