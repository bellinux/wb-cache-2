40|$|AbstractThis paper first {{summarizes}} the damages and recoveries of transport {{caused by the}} devastating earthquake occurred in Japan in March 2011. Responses of freight railway, such as transporting immediately-needed supplies and fuel, are reviewed. The role of <b>intermodal</b> freight <b>transport</b> in supplying fuel to disaster areas is especially stressed. The necessity and importance of <b>intermodal</b> freight <b>transport</b> in the disaster recovery is discussed. <b>Intermodal</b> freight <b>transport</b> contributes to social and economic benefits by enhancing flexibility and redundancy of freight transport, as well as sustaining the vital freight flow in the disasters...|$|R

25|$|Every {{piece of}} {{railroad}} rolling stock operating in North American interchange service {{is required to}} carry a standardized set of reporting marks. The marks {{are made up of}} a two- to four-letter code identifying the owner of the equipment accompanied by an identification number and statistics on the equipment's capacity and tare (unloaded) weight. Marks whose codes end in X (such as TTGX) are used on equipment owned by entities that are not common carrier railroads themselves. Marks whose codes end in U are used on containers that are carried in <b>intermodal</b> <b>transport,</b> and marks whose codes end in Z are used on trailers that are carried in <b>intermodal</b> <b>transport,</b> per ISO standard 6346). Most freight cars carry automatic equipment identification RFID transponders.|$|E
25|$|The Metro in Málaga {{began with}} {{proposals}} {{in the late}} '90s to create a light rail network to relieve the problem of traffic congestion in the city. In 2001, the Ministry of Public Works and Transport commissioned a study based on suggestions in the <b>Intermodal</b> <b>Transport</b> Plan, which had initially proposed four lines. The first two lines are still under construction as of 2012.|$|E
25|$|Since its {{construction}} stages, the Chennai MRTS {{has had its}} share of controversies and criticism, including the cost-effectiveness of the route, accessibility, poor maintenance of stations, lack of <b>intermodal</b> <b>transport</b> facility, environmental concerns, budgeting issues and security issues. In light of these issues, which further impacted the line's low ridership, the MRTS has been working incrementally to change its image to Chennai's residents, by addressing and ameliorating the current conditions.|$|E

25|$|Contship Overland was a {{division}} of Contship Containerlines operating {{at the forefront of}} Europe's intermodal industry. The company had offices in Felixstowe, Glasgow and Milan, and worked with partners in Spain and Greece, providing rail freight solutions to key markets and road freight options where required by customers. Its main business consisted of intermodal container and swapbody traffic between the UK and Italy, mostly by rail via the Channel Tunnel. After approximately ten years in business, Contship Overland was sold to the Rotterdam-based <b>intermodal</b> <b>transport</b> operator Geest North Sea Line with effect of 1 October 2001.|$|E
25|$|Domestically rail {{transport}} has a {{market share of}} between 52 and 66 percent of <b>intermodal</b> <b>transport</b> from Oslo to Bergen, Trondheim and Stavanger. The corresponding market share on international routes is only 17 percent. It is an explicit political goal to increase {{rail transport}}'s market share. The volume internationally {{is much higher than}} domestically, for instance 8.5 million tonnes from the south corridor compared to 1.6 million tonnes to Trondheim in 2011. The volume is expected to grow with 150 percent by 2040. The government is therefore prioritizing upgrading the corridor through Østfold to handle more freight. Development of the corridor would allow for direct intermodal train services to destinations in Central Europe.|$|E
25|$|Negotiations {{subsequently}} turned {{towards the}} amount of that tax, and Switzerland offered {{to build a new}} high-speed rail link through the Alps for the main purpose of <b>intermodal</b> <b>transport,</b> which has been accepted by a public vote on 27 September 1992. The EU finally accepted the offer in 2000, but demanded that the then valid 28-tonne limit for trucks be raised to 48 tonnes. A compromise was reached on a step-by-step raise of the weight limit to 40 tonnes. The bilateral Land Transport Agreement with the European Union was thus signed, agreeing to an increase of the kilometre-based tax on HGVs from 1.6ct/tkm to 1.8ct/tkm at completion of the NRLA. This condition has been deemed fulfilled at the completion of the Lötschberg Base Tunnel.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{extended}} usage of pallet-wide containers in Europe the EU started the Intermodal Loading Unit (ILU) initiative. This showed advantages for <b>intermodal</b> <b>transport</b> of containers and swap bodies. This {{led to the}} introduction of ILU-Codes defined by the standard EN 13044 which has the same format as the earlier BIC-Codes. The International Container Office BIC agreed to only issue ownership codes ending with U, J or Z. The new allocation office of the UIRR (International Union of Combined Road-Rail Transport Companies) agreed to only issue ownership reporting marks for swap bodies ending with A, B, C, D or K – companies having a BIC-Code ending with U can allocate an ILU-Code ending with K having the same preceding letters. Since July 2011 the new ILU codes can be registered, beginning with July 2014 all intermodal ISO containers and intermodal swap bodies must have an ownership code and by July 2019 all of them must bear a standard-conforming placard.|$|E
500|$|Lack of {{electrification}} {{has been}} described as the [...] "missing green link" [...] in using the Meråker Line for <b>intermodal</b> <b>transport</b> for shipping out of Trondheim. The line could also act redundantly for fish exports from Northern Norway to the continent. The steep gradient between Gudå and Storlien is prohibitive for a single diesel locomotive, but would be more economical for electric traction. These issues limit cargo hauling on the line to lumber trains.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} a model is {{developed}} to analyse {{and compare the}} <b>transport</b> costs of <b>intermodal</b> inland waterway <b>transport</b> and road-only-transport. The influence of the economies of scale in inland waterway transport and terminal operations {{are taken into account}} in the analysis. In the model the transport costs are defined and related to different transport operations and conditions (e. g. share of empty kilometres, capacity usage of terminals, etc.) in order to analyse the sensitivity of the cost performance of <b>intermodal</b> inland waterway <b>transport.</b> By doing this it is possible to analyse to what extent <b>intermodal</b> freight <b>transport</b> is competitive with road-only transport in terms of transport costs and specific operations and conditions (both in shipping and terminal). The conclusions prove that roundtrips, drop & pick operations in pre- and end-haulage and smaller containers (20 ft instead of 40 ft) considerably improve the competitiveness of <b>intermodal</b> inland waterway <b>transport,</b> while the relative high cost operations in small terminals reduce the competitiveness of <b>intermodal</b> inland waterway <b>transport...</b>|$|R
