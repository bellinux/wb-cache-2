50|$|The {{only answer}} is to obtain several tons of {{polyurethane}} liquid in 2 compounds which when combined produces an <b>expanding</b> <b>foam</b> that will fill the huge sinkhole cavern.

Due to an emergency, while Matt is underground inspecting the caverns, he becomes partially trapped, and has to ask to have the foam started (which will kill him if he can't find an escape) because if they don't start {{the flow of the}} liquid immediately, the ground underneath downtown New Orleans will collapse similar to the effects of soil liquefaction and thousands {{to tens of thousands of}} people will be injured or killed. The last few minutes of the film become a race against time as Matt attempts to find an exit before the polyurethane foam envelops him.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA template-free {{approach}} is described for {{the synthesis of}} <b>expanded</b> <b>foams</b> of mesoporous carbon exhibiting high surface areas ranging from 550 to 1100 m 2 /g. The procedure {{is based on the}} exceptional carbonization reaction that occurs with squaric acid (H 2 C 4 O 4), a strained four-membered carbocycle belonging to the oxocarbon acids. Indeed the pyrolysis reaction proceeds just above 300 °C through an amazing one-step and sharp exothermic phenomenon coupled with a weight loss of 90 %, thereby promoting a porous structure. This massive gas release behaves also as a "fluid" template during the carbon production, which explains the formation of <b>expanded</b> <b>foams.</b> This particular thermal behaviour seems related to the phase transition that occurs in H 2 C 4 O 4 crystals at Tc= 121 °C. Below Tc the planar squaric acid molecules exhibit a fully ordered structure in a monoclinic system whereas for T>Tc the structure undergoes a disordered tetragonal structure where all C-O bonds of squaric acid become statistically equivalent in a perfect square, making a discrete thermal decomposition reaction possible...|$|R

50|$|Spray foam {{is a type}} of {{insulation}} that is sprayed in place through a gun. Polyurethane and isocyanate foams are applied as a two-component mixture that comes together at the tip of a gun, and forms an <b>expanding</b> <b>foam.</b> Cementitious foam is applied in a similar manner but does not expand. Spray foam insulation is sprayed onto concrete slabs, into wall cavities of an unfinished wall, against the interior side of sheathing, or through holes drilled in sheathing or drywall into the wall cavity of a finished wall.|$|E
5000|$|The {{process itself}} {{is known to}} be very interesting, because the {{injected}} compound is not foam, until an endothermic reaction in a hot mold activates the blowing agents, resulting in an <b>expanded</b> <b>foam</b> part. This requires the mold cavity size to be smaller than the final part. The actual known expansion is created within the formula, so that when the part [...] "self-ejects" [...] from the mold {{at the end of the}} cycle, it grows to the required part size.|$|R

50|$|Currently, the United States National Electrical Code forbids {{the use of}} loose, blown-in, or <b>expanding</b> <b>foam</b> {{insulation}} over K&T wiring. This {{is because}} K&T is designed to let heat dissipate to the surrounding air. As a result, energy efficiency upgrades that involve insulating previously uninsulated walls usually also require replacement of the wiring in affected homes. However, California, Washington, Nebraska, and Oregon have modified the NEC to conditionally allow insulation around K&T. They did not find a single fire that was attributed to K&T, and permit insulation provided the home first passes inspection by an electrician.|$|E
5000|$|A boy racer is a {{motorist}} of any gender {{who drives}} an automobile {{that has been}} modified with aftermarket body kits, audio system and exhaust system, usually in an unlawful manner. [...] It can also mean a compact sporty coupe that is heavily modified for racing. Wealthier motorists who drive sports cars, or those with costly modifications, often seek {{to distance themselves from}} the culture. Responses to the boy racer phenomenon range from laws prohibiting cosmetic modifications to vehicles such as decorative lighting and window tint, restrictions on recreational driving ("cruising"), to vandalism such as spraying <b>expanding</b> <b>foam</b> into cars with loud [...] "big-bore" [...] exhaust tips to stop such cars driving around emitting loud droning noises.|$|E
5000|$|Foam {{leveling}} uses {{closed cell}} polymer <b>expanding</b> <b>foam</b> in an injection process. A two part polymer (example, components A and B [...] is injected {{through a hole}} less than one inch in diameter, typically 5/8." [...] Although the material is injected at a higher psi rate than traditional cementitious grouts, the pressure is not what causes the lifting. The expansion of the air bubbles in the injected material below the slab surface performs the actual lifting action as the liquid resin reacts and becomes a structural foam. Material injected below a slab to be lifted will first find weak soils, expanding into them {{in such a manner}} as to consolidate and cause sub-soils to become more dense and fill any voids below the slab. One inherent property of expanding foams is that they will follow the path of least resistance, expanding in all directions. Another inherent property includes reaching a hydro-insensitive or hydrophobic state when cured with 100% cure times as little as 30 minutes. Closed cell polymer foams offer benefits that go beyond the goal of leveling hard surfaces. They will not retain moisture, which in northern climates can cause frost heaving. They are not subject to erosion once in place. Their fast cure time allows for immediate use when application is complete. Their light weight, 3 to 8 lbs. per cubic ft. vs. 100 to 120 lbs. per cubic ft. for cementitious grout will not cause further settlement. Foams will retain their cured shape and volume indefinitely reducing the possibility of new voids forming below grade to nearly zero unless acted upon by some outside cause. Some closed cell polymer foams have baseline lifting capabilities of 6,000 lbs per sq. ft. and leveling procedures have been performed in which loads as high as 125 tons have been lifted and stabilized in a surface area of less than 900 sq. ft.|$|E
