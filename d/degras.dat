25|$|With {{the capture}} of the Mahury forts, the French in Cayenne risked being cut off from {{external}} help and besieged. In response, Governor Victor Hugues mustered most of the 600 troops available to him and marched on the Allied positions. Consolidating his forces at <b>Dégras</b> de Cannes, Yeo demolished Fort Diamant and sent scouts down river, where two further forts were discovered at Trio and the Canal de Torcy. The latter fort had been constructed to defend the approaches to Hugues' residence, which was situated on the canal. Yeo immediately ordered the Portuguese cutters Leão and Vingança into the river to attack the forts, the Portuguese bombarding the positions for an hour while Yeo prepared assault forces. Yeo himself led {{the attack on the}} Trio fort while a Portuguese party attacked the fort on the canal. Both positions were captured and their 50 strong garrisons driven off.|$|E
25|$|As Yeo secured his {{position}} from {{attack from the}} river, Hugues arrived at <b>Dégras</b> de Cannes. Despite attacking Lieutenant Colonel Marques' garrison immediately, Hugues was unable to defeat the Portuguese before Yeo returned, {{and was forced to}} retreat after a three-hour engagement. A secondary force sent against Fort Diamant saw the British demolition party on the walls and, assuming the garrison there to be larger than expected, retreated without an assault. The following morning, as Hugues fell back on his residence, Yeo followed, using the river and canal to close with the position. Hugues had fortified his property with 100 men and two artillery pieces, and ordered his men to fire on a party of British sailors offering a truce. A second attempt was met with cannon fire, and although a third attempt via one of Hugues' slaves drew a response, the French general's overtures were only an attempt to stall the Allies while his men laid an ambush in the trees near their landing point.|$|E
25|$|The town of Cayenne is {{situated}} {{on an island}} in the mouth of the Cayenne and Mahury Rivers. In 1809, its approaches were protected by a series of forts and gun batteries, while the town itself was dominated by a modern star fort. Acknowledging that his force was not large enough to invade the island directly, Yeo decided instead to attack a series of outlying forts on the Mahury River in an effort to draw out the French defenders. On 6 January 1809, preparations were complete and Yeo launched an attack during the night, landing at Pointe Mahury at 03:00 on 7 January in five canoes despite heavy rains, which continued throughout the campaign. The surf was strong and all five canoes were wrecked on the beach, but there were no casualties. Yeo detached a Portuguese force under Major Joaquim Manuel Pinto against the <b>Dégras</b> de Cannes battery while he advanced on Fort Diamant with a force of seamen and marines. Both positions were rapidly carried, the British suffering seven men wounded to French losses of six killed and four wounded. Four cannons were seized, as were 90 French soldiers. Both fortifications were then garrisoned with soldiers from the squadron.|$|E
50|$|This episode begins {{three years}} in the future with Captain Archer and <b>Degra</b> (the {{scientist}} behind the Xindi weapon project) aboard a shuttle escaping from an Insectoid prison camp. <b>Degra,</b> however, cannot remember his time as Archer's cell-mate and friend, and remains suspicious despite having a prison tattoo and long greying hair. Archer convinces him that {{this is due to the}} blood worms in his system (used because they excrete a truth drug), and removes a worm from <b>Degra's</b> arm.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, a {{dangerous}} plasma fire erupts unnoticed on Enterprises hull. Initially, the blaze is small, but it expands progressively until Tucker and Lieutenant Reed {{are forced to}} extinguish it. Throughout the crises, Tucker repeatedly undermines the Captain's authority by reviling <b>Degra</b> for the suffering he caused during the April, 2153 attack on Earth that killed his sister. To make matters worse, a large Reptilian ship arrives and {{they are forced to}} work together to destroy it, despite <b>Degra's</b> reluctance to attack fellow Xindi. With their pact now sealed, <b>Degra</b> suggests a meeting {{with the rest of the}} Council, and provides Archer with the coordinates.|$|R
50|$|This leaves Archer with a dilemma; {{travelling}} to the {{red giant}} star, Azati Prime, would take them three weeks, time {{they do not have}} to waste on a wild goose chase. Instead they again deceive <b>Degra</b> into thinking that they have utilized Xindi warp technology to open subspace vortices, and trick him into thinking that they have already arrived at the coordinates. <b>Degra</b> shouts that they will never be able to breach the base's defenses, thus proving that the coordinates do in fact relate to the weapon. The episode ends with a third deception, with the mind-wiped <b>Degra</b> and his crew being placed back on their ship.|$|R

40|$|<b>Degra</b> (now in version 3) is a {{computer}} program that simulates {{the performance of a}} radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) over its lifetime. <b>Degra</b> is provided with a graphical user interface that is used to edit input parameters that describe the initial state of the RTG and the time-varying loads and environment to which it will be exposed. Performance is computed by modeling the flows of heat from the radioactive source and through the thermocouples, also allowing for losses, to determine the temperature drop across the thermocouples. This temperature drop is used to determine the open-circuit voltage, electrical resistance, and thermal conductance of the thermocouples. Output power can then be computed by relating the open-circuit voltage and the electrical resistance of the thermocouples to a specified time-varying load voltage. <b>Degra</b> accounts for the gradual deterioration of performance attributable primarily to decay of the radioactive source and secondarily to gradual deterioration of the thermoelectric material. To provide guidance to an RTG designer, given a minimum of input, <b>Degra</b> computes the dimensions, masses, and thermal conductances of important internal structures as well as the overall external dimensions and total mass...|$|R

40|$|Africa is {{responsible}} for 96 % of the world's production of food yams; producing almost 30 millions tons a year. Most of the remainder is produced in the Caribbean and Pacific. For 150 million people, yam is, together with cassava and potato, a food staple. In the last thirteen years, production has risen by 17 % ? to the considerable surprise {{of those involved in}} yam research. It had appeared that yam cultivation could not be increased, because the traditional methods employed were believed to be resistant to change, and because it requires much water. The increased production is a response to growing demands from urban consumers. The farmers of the main producer countries (Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Gabon, Ghana, Nigeria and Togo) have changed their cultivation techniques, and switched their selection of varieties to meet demand for a specific yam product, often known as the 'podlet'. This is made by smashing a small yam into pieces. The pieces are dried in the sun and become powdery. The 'podlet' is light and easy to transport, and sells for less than fresh yam. It takes just a small blow to break it up and obtain flour, from which a couscous and biscuits, or, better still, amala may be prepared. Noticeably different from traditional household foufou, amala is leading to the emergence of a much appreciated form of street food in Togo, Nigeria and Benin. Despite its known nutritional value and pharmaceutical properties, yam has not yet been adopted for large-scale treatment in the food processing and agro-pharmaceutical industry. For the last fifteen years, some industrial companies have started to produce a yam conserve and some processed items (crisps, chips, flour and flakes). Many such initiatives have become entangled in the classical problems of transportation and conservation of fresh tubers, and have not gone beyond the experimental phase or pilot processing plant. The export share of yam has fallen to 0. 2 % of its production. Nevertheless, yam has a good future. Important pharmaceutical properties based on diosgenin and related molecules have been long recognised in wild yam. In its cultivated form, it is particularly rich in starch, mineral salts, proteins and vitamins, giving it a nutritional value comparable to cereals. Notwithstanding it's usefulness, there are still many technological barriers to be overcome before the full potential of this tuber can be exploited. Further reading: The Yam. A tropical root crop.

40|$|Detailed lithostratigraphic {{analysis}} and new fossil data {{have resulted in}} a revised and refined stratigraphic and sedimentologic framework for the autochthonous, Middle Cambrian to Lower Ordovician, shallow water sedimentary sequence in western Newfoundland. Study of five separate localities, spanning a distance of 285 km., indicates that much more of this 900 metre thick sequence Is of Cambrian age and much Less of Ordovician age than previously reported. [...] The oldest units studied are of late Lower Cambrian age and can be recognized in three of the five localities where they are named the <b>Degras</b> Formation (at the Port-au-Port Peninsula), the Penguin Cove Formation (at Goose Arm), and the Hawke Bay Formation (at Bonne Bay). These thick-bedded, supermature, quartzose sandstones are interpreted to have formed as a system of barrier bars or beaches. [...] An overlying succession of distinctive. Middle and Upper Cambrian, limestones, dolostones, and shales is recognized from Port-au-Port in the south to Hawkes Bay in the north. This succession is variously known as the March Point (revised) and overlying Petit Jardin (revised) Formations at Port-au-Port, the Wolf Brook (proposed) and overlying Blue Cliff (proposed) Formations at Goose Arm, the South Head (proposed) and overlying East Arm (revised) Formations at Bonne Bay, and the upper Hawke Bay Formation at Hawkes Bay. [...] Middle and Upper Cambrian rocks are characterized by conspicuously cyclic, "high-energy" lithofacies and comprise two large scale sequences which repeat, in vertical succession, as many as three times: (I) thin-bedded sequences composed of flaser bedded limestone and shale intercalated with occasional beds of edgewise conglomerate, stromatolites, and oolite, interpreted as a mixed carbonate-sillciclastlc tidal flat and (2) thick-bedded sequences composed of intraformational conglomerate, in places oncolitic, cross-bedded oolite, and laminated, mud cracked calcilutite, interpreted as carbonate sand shoals or barrier islands. [...] The succeeding Lower Ordovician St. George Formation (revised) is recognized along the length of western Newfoundland and is divided into three members: the lower cyclic member, of interbedded limestone and dolostone, the middle limestone member, a thick limestone unit locally overprinted by epigenetic dolomitization, and the upper cyclic member, of interbedded limestone and dolostone. Thickness of the St. George is about 550 metres, greatly reduced from previous estimates. [...] A disconformity that dies out to the north separates the St. George from the overlying basal limestone of the Middle Ordovician Table Head Formation. [...] Lower Ordovician lithofacies are characterized by "low energy" subtidal features, with few diagnostic intertidal features, and comprise two megarhythms: (1) carbonate cycles grading from burrowed, fossiliferous, subtidal limestone to microcrystalline, laminated, occasionally mud cracked, supratidal dolostone, interpreted as shoaling upward cycles on a protected tidal flat and (2) burrowed, fossiliferous, hackly weathering, subtidal limestone, representing deposition in a protected lagoonal environment. [...] These rocks record a major marine transgression and may reflect a change {{in the form of the}} shallow water continental margin from a ramp or open shelf in the Cambrian to a mound-rimmed carbonate platform in the Ordovician. Superimposed on this major transgression are as many as five smaller transgressive/regressive events. ...|$|E
