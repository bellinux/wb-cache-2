Distance Learning companion project started from October 22, 2013 to January 9, 2014. Forty four <b>e-tutors</b> participated for one hour and a half a course, twice per week. The results indicated that at the beginning of distance learning companion project, forty-two <b>e-tutors</b> showed high job readiness and high psychological readiness (R 4), and two <b>e-tutors</b> showed low job readiness and high psychological readiness (R 2). After a semester of teaching and training, 44 were high job readiness and high psychological (R 4). According to the results of the study, job readiness was improved and the psychological readiness was maintained. In the study, it was found that the content of the training workshop mainly focused on job readiness, but neglected psychological readiness.

40|$|The {{ubiquity of}} Web 2. 0 {{technologies}} {{has led to}} a seismic shift in the way educational services are delivered. It comes as no surprise then that e-tutoring—otherwise known as electronic or online tutoring—is quickly supplanting face-to-face tuition for reasons of both cost and convenience. While <b>e-tutoring</b> is an effective form of academic support for many students, its efficacy remains tenuous for those confronted with a digital divide that figures predominantly around geographic barriers, socio-economic status, and educational levels. Premised on diffusion research, this master's dissertation explores the implementation of an <b>e-tutoring</b> service known as Homework Help that has effected relatively low adoption rates.

40|$|Learning and {{teaching}} English language {{from a distance}} {{is considered to be}} a new initiative in the tertiary level of the education system in Saudi Arabia. This research study was conducted to explore the e-tutors’ perceptions of their roles in a Distance English Language Learning Programme (DLLP) in one of the Saudi universities. It further inquiries how these perceptions in this specific context of teaching and learning may help their learners take control over their learning. To fulfill this aim, I adopted an exploratory case study design to gain an in-depth understanding of the topic. Moreover, the following overarching research question was formulated: What are the perceptions of <b>e-tutors</b> about learning {{and teaching}} processes in the context of DLLP? A specific focus of the research was to explore the ways in which the tutors might support their distance learners to be autonomous and attain a level of control over their learning. Three data collection methods were used, namely document analysis, reflective journals,and semi-structured interviews. A sample of 14 <b>e-tutors</b> was purposely selected from one Saudi university. Content analysis was used to identify critical issues in the collected documents while a thematic analysis framework (Braun and Clark, 2006) was adopted to interpret the data from the reflective journals and semi-structured interviews. Emerging themes include some interesting, unexpected issues related to this teaching context, such as the cultural constraints and their impact on e-learning in Saudi universities, and the necessity of the use of L 1 by the <b>e-tutors</b> in their teaching of the English language. This study’s findings contributed to developing a framework which helps <b>e-tutors</b> to encourage their distance learners to control and manage their learning of English as a foreign language in this specific DLLP.

40|$|Abstract—Collaborative working {{environments for}} {{distance}} {{education can be}} considered as a more generic form of contemporary remote labs. At present, the majority of existing real laboratories are not constructed to allow the involved participants to collaborate in real time. To make this revolutionary learning environment possible we must allow the different users to carry out an experiment simultaneously. In recent times, multi-user environments are successfully applied in many applications such as air traffic control systems, team-oriented military systems, chat-text tools, multi-player games etc. Thus, understanding the ideas and techniques behind these systems could be of great importance in the contribution of ideas to our e-learning environment for collaborative working. In this investigation, collaborative working environments from theoretical and practical perspectives are considered in order to build an effective collaborative real laboratory, which allows two students or more to conduct remote experiments {{at the same time as}} a team. In order to achieve this goal, we have implemented distributed system architecture, enabling students to obtain an automated help by either a human tutor or a rule-based <b>e-tutor.</b> Keywords—Collaboration environment, <b>e-tutor,</b> multi-user environments, socio-technical system.
