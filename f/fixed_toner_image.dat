40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a {{mathematical}} model which maps the binary <b>image</b> to the <b>toner</b> <b>image</b> for a digital laser printing system. The model integrates three of the fundamental steps, i. e., charging, exposure, and development, in the electrophotographic process along with a sub-model describing the laser dot placement.

50|$|Paper {{is passed}} between the drum and the {{transfer}} corona, {{which has a}} polarity that {{is the opposite of}} the charge on the <b>toner.</b> The <b>toner</b> <b>image</b> is transferred from the drum to the paper by a combination of pressure and electrostatic attraction. On many color and high-speed machines, it is common to replace the transfer corona with one or more charged bias transfer rollers, which apply greater pressure and produce a higher quality image.|$|R
30|$|In this section, we {{describe}} how printers/copiers work, and the characteristic telltale ‘signatures’ they generate in a document. Differing technical processes and mechanical constructions cause different character morphologies in the document. In the electrophotographic process of laser printing, {{there are six}} steps: charging, exposure, developing, transferring, fusing, and cleaning [5]. The optoelectronic devices in a laser printer accurately transfer the image signal corresponding to the document, and the <b>toner</b> <b>image</b> is melted by the fuser and pressed onto the paper. As a result, the printed characters have a glossy appearance and a clear contour.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>toner</b> <b>image</b> is {{permanently}} <b>fixed</b> to {{the paper}} using either a heat and pressure mechanism (hot roll fuser) or a radiant fusing technology (oven fuser) to melt and bond the toner particles into the medium (usually paper) being printed. There also used to be available [...] "offline" [...] vapor fusers. These were trays covered in cotton gauze sprinkled with a volatile liquid, such as ether. When the transferred image was brought into proximity with the vapor from the evaporating liquid, {{the result was a}} perfectly fixed copy without any of the distortion or toner migration which can occur with the other methods. This method is no longer used due to emissions of fumes.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addressed}} {{the question of}} what level of resolution was obtainable from the electrostatic plate. Resolution was defined as the ability of a material to record fine detail. Two types of plates were compared, one photomechanical and the other an electrostatic. The photomechanical plate consisted of a light sensitive coating applied to an aluminum 1 base. The electrostatic plate consisted of a fused <b>toner</b> <b>image</b> on an aluminum base. The intent of this research was to determine the final resolution, not the forces and factors which effected it. The hypothesis stated that the resulting resolution of the electrostatic plate will be lower than that of the photo mechanical plate.

40|$|In dry toner electrophotography, hot-roll fusing is {{the method}} most {{commonly}} used to <b>fix</b> the <b>toner</b> to the media. In hot-roll fusing, the combined effects of time, temperature and pressure determine the fusing quality {{with respect to the}} degree of <b>toner</b> <b>fixing</b> and gloss level. Acceptable fusing quality can only be achieved when the process parameters are within the fusing latitude, or “fusing window. ” In this paper, the effect of the fusing process parameters on gloss is studied experimentally using a computer-controlled hot-roll test apparatus. The roles of media and coating are also examined for insight into the mechanisms of gloss development. The importance of lubrication, fuser roller design, and other practical considerations for minimizing hot-offset and extending the fusing window are also touched on...|$|R
40|$|Fusing is {{the last}} process in the laser printer and {{is known to have}} a {{significant}} impact on the image quality of the printed document. More must be done to understand the components of the fuser and the toner fusing process. This understanding would assist in the development of a basic model for describing the fusing process. Constructing such a basic model will help in the future design of fusers, toner and media. In this work, fuser effects on gloss have been studied and analyzed using two current HP Color LaserJet (CLJ) printers, the CLJ 4700 and CLJ 4650. These products differ in their fuser design, toner formulation, and gloss performance. To study the fusing parameters that affect gloss, the contribution of the fuser designs, fuser control conditions and toner type were separated out by using an independent fusing system that allowed samples created in the two different printers to be fused using a common process. An experimental approach was used to build a foundation for developing a physical model of the fusing process. The toner type was found to have the largest effect on gloss. The toner type effect on gloss can be credited to the rheological properties of the <b>toner.</b> <b>Image</b> density was the second largest effect on gloss and can be categorized by three regions: 1) low density (substrate dependent), 2) medium density (pattern dependent), and 3) high density (fusing process dependent). Nip duration, pressure, and temperature are secondary design variables that should be used to further optimize the fusing system, especially for high density images, once the fuser physical design is fixed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – The toner {{is used in}} photocopiers to {{form the}} latent {{electrical}} image on the drum. The paper picks up the <b>toner</b> particles (<b>image),</b> when it slides over the drum. Approximately 10 % of toner particles are left over the drum due to specific factors. This left out toner is cleaned by the unit to ensure the copy quality of the proceeding copies. This left out toner is called as waste toner and is collected in cleaner sump. If this waste toner {{is used in the}} photocopiers, the quality of the copier is reduced. The waste toner is mixed in proportion with Carbon Black Nano powder and original toner to get Hybrid Carbon Black Toner. The original toner is the toner prescribed for the photocopier by the manufacturer. By implementation of this technique, the cost of photocopy can be reduced {{and the quality of the}} photocopy can be increased...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: It {{is known}} that the neutral image tone of a {{developed}} photographic film becomes brownish when {{the thickness of the}} original silver halide tabular crystals is reduced. We investigate by electron microscopy to what extent the silver filament structure has changed and how it induces the shift in image tone. Therefore, two samples of AgBr { 111 } tabular crystals with average thicknesses of 160 nm and 90 nm respectively, are compared. It is shown that the dimensions and defect structure of the filaments are comparable, but that the 90 nm crystals result in a more widely spaced structure, which explains the shift in image tone on a qualitative level. The influence of the addition of an <b>image</b> <b>toner,</b> i. e., phenylmercaptotetrazole, on the filament structure is also investigated. An even more open filament structure of longer, but smaller filaments was observed...|$|R
50|$|In {{high-volume}} copiers, {{the drum}} is {{presented with a}} slowly turbulent mixture of toner particles and larger, iron, reusable carrier particles. Toner is a powder; its early form was carbon powder, then melt-mixed with a polymer. The carrier particles have a coating which, during agitation, generates a triboelectric charge (a form of static electricity), which attracts a coating of toner particles. In addition, the mix is manipulated with a magnetic roller {{to present to the}} surface of the drum or belt a brush of toner. By contact with the carrier each neutral toner particle has an electric charge of polarity opposite to the charge of the latent image on the drum. The charge attracts toner to form a visible image on the drum. To control the amount of toner transferred, a bias voltage is applied to the developer roller to counteract the attraction between <b>toner</b> and latent <b>image.</b>|$|R
40|$|Product end use {{dictates}} {{the materials}} used to produce a printed piece. If flexographic printers are purchasing ink for a packaging carton job, they don 2 ̆ 7 t choose a scuff prone ink. The same should be true for printers producing letterheads for subsequent use in electrophotographic equipment. Electrophotography is an image transfer process that uses the principles of electrostatics. An Ektaprint 200 copier/duplicator charges {{the surface of a}} sheet exposing an image area, develops that <b>image,</b> affixes <b>toner</b> to that <b>image</b> and then mechanically traps the toner {{to the surface of the}} substrate using heat and/or pressure. When a litho graphically printed letterhead is subject to the heat of a fuser roller, it can cause the ink to resoften and subsequently transfer to the next sheets passing through the copier, an undesirable effect. This experiment tested various ink/paper/drying combinations to determine whether or not specific print conditions affect the transfer of lithographic ink during electrophotographic imprinting. A test form was designed to include all the images typically printed on a letterhead. Each test sample was first printed under controlled conditions and then run through an Ektaprint 200 copier/duplicator. Visual assessment was used to evaluate test samples. The presence 2 or absence of image transfer determined whether or not the null 2 ̆ 7 hypothesis was rejected. A Wilcoxon sign test was used to determine whether or not a test sample could be evaluated. A level of. 05 significance was obtained in two cases. These samples were excluded from the results. Densitometric readings were taken to determine the severity of the lithographic image transfer. Various ink and paper characteristics were evaluated using descriptive statistics. Twenty-one print conditions exhibited no visual image transfer when processed in the Ektaprint 200. These ink/ paper/drying conditions could guide printers of letter- heads which are to be subsequently processed in electrophotographic equipment...|$|R
40|$|The {{life cycle}} of commercially printed digital {{documents}} (in particular, marketing and promotional items, direct mailers, business communications, and on-demand color books) was examined to find stress points where potential permanence problems could exist. The stress and life cycle overview covers the stages of processes in printing and finishing, mailing preparation and fulfillment, distribution, usage, and recycling. Stress points found in the different stages of the life cycle, whether physical or chemical, include (but are not limited to) scratching, rubbing, cracking, solvent exposure, light exposure, moisture exposure, heat exposure, and air contamination exposure. Tests for abrasion resistance, folding resistance, solvent resistance, light-fastness, water-fastness, thermostability, and gas/ozone fastness were researched. Based on a survey given to randomly selected printers, printing press vendors, and print buyers, the tests for abrasion resistance, folding resistance, and rub resistance were selected. Using offset lithography as a benchmark, three commercial digital presses as well as high-speed ink jet technology were included in this testing. Using a combination of solid circular test targets and the “Three Musicians” test target (an image for visual comparisons), the Taber Abraser testing method, the Sutherland Rub testing method, and a folding procedure outlined in ASTM document F 1351 were used to examine and to compare the five presses in this study (three commercial digital presses, one offset lithographic press, and one high-speed ink jet press). After testing was performed, visual ranking, changes in density, Delta E, and the abrasion resistance index were used as the criteria to evaluate results. Testing {{results showed that the}} high-speed ink jet held up the best in each test performed during this research; however, the image quality of the high-speed ink jet press was less than the image quality of any other press in this study. The second best performer in the testing was the offset lithographic press. The test performance of these particular presses, as compared with the commercial digital presses, was attributed to the different drying methods in each of the different printing technologies. In the ink jet and lithographic presses, the evaporation, absorption, and oxidation drying methods seemed to hold up better to the testing performed than the drying method of toner-based technology. With oxidation and evaporation, the image (i. e., the ink) actually becomes a part of the paper after drying, whereas, in <b>toner</b> technology, the <b>image</b> (i. e., the toner) is fused to the paper and actually sits on top of it. Within the digital printing industry, coatings have been put in place to alleviate some of these problems, but they have not been tested here. This research shows that offset lithography is the dominant technology in terms of offering abrasion and folding resistance of its printed product...|$|R
40|$|Image {{quality and}} the {{mechanisms}} involved in digital dry toner electrophotography {{are influenced by the}} interactions between the printing machine, toner and paper in the last two steps where the paper is involved, i. e., in transferring the developed <b>image</b> <b>toner</b> to the paper, and in fusing the image to be fixed permanently on the paper surface. This study discusses the role of paper in these two steps in different technologies and its effect on the printing mechanisms and image quality. The control of optical, electrostatic and mass and heat transfer phenomena in the printing process are affected by the unevenness of the properties of paper due to its heterogeneous structure and its sensitivity to humidity conditions and printing process parameters. In this research, a set of experiments was conducted to understand the electrostatic behaviour of paper in toner transfer and thermal behaviour in toner fusing. The results show that not only image quality is affected by the variability of paper properties, but also the mechanisms of toner transfer and fusing. Accordingly, the research suggests that the paper should be included as part of the printing mechanism, performance (printability and runnability), and image quality. Consequently, if there is a change in paper properties due to a change in ambient conditions or the use of another grade for a specific application, the process parameters can be adjusted to compensate for these changes {{in order to meet the}} requirements for image quality. It was found that the variability in image quality in terms of colours (the requirement for different toner layers), grey scale (halftone structure) and the location of the image in the xy-plane is affected when rendered through the electrophotographic process. The fast mechanical speed in printing machine direction drives the toner transfer and fusing mechanisms differently from the cross machine direction. As a result, a certain image element such as a line will have different quality in these two printing directions, or if the line is placed in the length or width direction of the page. The conclusion was that the electrophotographic process should be designed to reduce or even to neglect the effect of paper when printing a high-quality colour image in a high-speed process. This can be achieved by eliminating the contact with paper from the image side in both transfer and fusing by adopting the technologies of toner jumping transfer and non-contact flash fusing. These technologies have special requirements for chemical and physical toner properties, such as modification for equal absorbance of the flash radiation by CMYK colours, a suitable melting viscosity and surface energy, and a small and narrow toner particle size and shape distribution to unify the charge-to-mass ratio of the toner, which is important for transfer quality and efficiency. To ensure high print quality for different applications, some of the transfer and fusing parameters need to be automatically adjusted according to substrate specific properties and levels of image coverage...|$|R
40|$|The print {{substrate}} {{influences the}} print result in dry toner electrophotography, {{which is a}} widely used digital printing method. The influence of the substrate can be seen more easily in color printing, as that is a more complex process compared to monochrome printing. However, the print quality is also affected by the print substrate in grayscale printing. It is thus {{in the interests of}} both substrate producers and printing equipment manufacturers to understand the substrate properties that influence the quality of printed images in more detail. In dry <b>toner</b> electrophotography, the <b>image</b> is printed by transferring charged toner particles to the print substrate in the toner transfer nip, utilizing an electric field, in addition to the forces linked to the contact between toner particles and substrate in the nip. The toner transfer and the resulting image quality are thus influenced by the surface texture and the electrical and dielectric properties of the print substrate. In the investigation of the electrical and dielectric properties of the papers and the effects of substrate roughness, in addition to commercial papers, controlled sample sets were made on pilot paper machines and coating machines to exclude uncontrolled variables from the experiments. The electrical and dielectric properties of the papers investigated were electrical resistivity and conductivity, charge acceptance, charge decay, and the dielectric permittivity and losses at different frequencies, including the effect of temperature. The objective was to gain an understanding of how the electrical and dielectric properties are affected by normal variables in papermaking, including basis weight, material density, filler content, ion and moisture contents, and coating. In addition, the dependency of substrate resistivity on the electric field applied was investigated. Local discharging did not inhibit transfer with the paper roughness levels that are normal in electrophotographic color printing. The potential decay of paper revealed that the charge decay cannot be accurately described with a single exponential function, since in charge decay there are overlapping mechanisms of conduction and depolarization of paper. The resistivity of the paper depends on the NaCl content and exponentially on moisture content although it is also strongly dependent on the electric field applied. This dependency is influenced by the thickness, density, and filler contents of the paper. Furthermore, the Poole-Frenkel model {{can be applied to the}} resistivity of uncoated paper. The real part of the dielectric constant ε’ increases with NaCl content and relative humidity, but when these materials cannot polarize freely, the increase cannot be explained by summing the effects of their dielectric constants. Dependencies between the dielectric constant and dielectric loss factor and NaCl content, temperature, and frequency show that in the presence of a sufficient amount of moisture and NaCl, new structures with a relaxation time of the order of 10 - 3 s are formed in paper. The ε’ of coated papers is influenced by the addition of pigments and other coating additives with polarizable groups and due to the increase in density. The charging potential decreases and the electrical conductivity, potential decay rate, and dielectric constant of paper increase with increasing temperature. The dependencies are exponential and the temperature dependencies and their activation energies are altered by the ion content. The results have been utilized in manufacturing substrates for electrophotographic color printing...|$|R
