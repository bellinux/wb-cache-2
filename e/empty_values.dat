Longitudinal level (mm) is a parameter measured by Trafikverket to express a mean vertical position covering the wavelength ranges stipulated, and is then calculated through successive measurements.

40|$|Summary. The article {{deals with}} {{parameterized}} families of sets. When {{treated in a}} similar way as sets (due to systematic overloading notation used for sets) they are called many sorted sets. For instance, if x and X are two many-sorted sets (with the same set of indices I) then relation x ∈ X is defined as ∀i∈Ixi ∈ Xi. I was prompted by a remark in a paper by Tarlecki and Wirsing: “Throughout the paper we deal with many-sorted sets, functions, relations etc [...] We feel free to use any standard set-theoretic notation without explicit use of indices ” [6, p. 97]. The aim of this work was to check the feasibility of such approach in Mizar. It works. Let us observe some peculiarities:- empty set (i. e. the many sorted set with empty set of indices) belongs to itself (theorem 133),- we get two different inclusions X ⊆ Y iff ∀i∈IXi ⊆ Yi and X ⊑ Y iff ∀xx ∈ X ⇒ x ∈ Y equivalent only for sets that yield non <b>empty</b> <b>values.</b> Therefore the care is advised...|$|E
40|$|This page {{documents}} {{the results of}} some experiments conducted for our shape analyzer based on CLSs, as found in [1] and [2]. The rest of this document assumes you {{are familiar with the}} basics of the technique. See the References section for appropriate background. Overview of the tests We have considered six programs for our tests. The first four are synthetic codes representative of typical recursive data structures found in pointer-based codes. For the last two tests, we have designed a small program that computes the product of a sparse matrix by a sparse vector. Sparse structures are usually built with pointers to avoid wasting storage capacity with many <b>empty</b> <b>values.</b> Programs are preprocessed by a custom pass created over Cetus [4], an extensible Java infrastructure for source-to-source transformations. Basically, this pass translates a C input program into a format recognizable by the shape analyzer. When analysing a program, we do not need to consider all statements. Our technique only cares about control flow statements and pointer access statements, which is what the shape analyzer needs to obtain the graphs that describe the shape of memory configurations in the heap. In the codes shown below for the tests, we show the abridged version as analyzed by the shape analyzer. Therefore, the statements shown are exactly the statements analyzed...|$|E

40|$|Iron {{deficiency}} is frequent among athletes. All {{types of}} iron deficiency may affect physical performance {{and should be}} treated. The main mechanisms by which sport leads to iron deficiency are increased iron demand, elevated iron loss and blockage of iron absorption due to hepcidin bursts. As a baseline set of blood tests, haemoglobin, haematocrit, mean cellular volume, mean cellular haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels help monitor iron deficiency. In healthy {{male and female athletes}} > 15 years, ferritin values < 15 mcg are equivalent to <b>empty,</b> <b>values</b> from 15 to 30 mcg/l to low iron stores. Therefore a cut-off of 30 mcg/l is appropriate. For children aged from 6 - 12 years and younger adolescents from 12 - 15 years, cut-offs of 15 and 20 mcg/l, respectively, are recommended. As an exception in adult elite sports, a ferritin value of 50 mcg/l should be attained in athletes prior to altitude training, as iron demands in these situations are increased. Treatment of iron deficiency consists of nutritional counselling, oral iron supplementation or, in specific cases, by intravenous injection. Athletes with repeatedly low ferritin values benefit from intermittent oral substitution. It is important to follow up the athletes on an individual basis, repeating the baseline blood tests listed above twice a year. A long-term daily oral iron intake or i. v. supplementation in the presence of normal or even high ferritin values does not make sense and may be harmful...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-Authentication plays a {{major role}} in Digital {{environment}}. In this environment we have different methods which generally use alphanumeric characters and special characters for password creation. These methods have some problems like hard to remember password because it has no meaning and easily breakable by third parties or attackers. To address these issues, some of the researchers suggested many techniques for authentication and reveals graphical password method which is best one in terms of cost and usage. Basically, Graphical passwords use images for password creation and it has some demerits like hotspot and shoulder surfing problem. A persuasive cued click-point based method was proposed by Sonia Chiasson et al [6] which reduces hotspot problem but it fails in the case of shoulder surfing problem. To address these issues, the proposed work enhances the persuasive cued click point based method with some changes in the login phase and it uses double click point method for selecting click point. In login phase, a single click method takes <b>empty</b> <b>values</b> whenever a user uses a single click for selecting the click point. Where as in the case of double click method, it takes click point actual value. With these two types of clicks an attacker peeping over the shoulders of the authorized user can be confused with the clicks, as he will not be aware of the exact click points in the password. This reduces the shoulder surfing problem...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of a software system can be studied {{in terms of how}} various properties as reflected by software metrics change over time. We build a release history model by analysing the compiled class files. Our release history model captures metadata and 58 different metrics at a class level. We also build a class dependency graph for each release in the evolution history. The data selection and metric extraction method that we use ensures that we study non-trivial software allowing us to extend our findings to other comparable software systems built in Java. We also analyse compiled binaries that have already gone through the build process improving the accuracy of our measures. Further, as discussed in the previous chapter, we focus on contributions from the core development team ignoring third party libraries ensuring that the metrics that we collect are a better reflection of the development effort. Chapter 4 (Measuring Evolving Software) of the thesis this data accompanies explains the metric extraction process and provides a discussion of the metrics we collect from the Java software systems and provide appropriate motivation for our choices. The metrics for each software system are in a separate data file. The raw metric data files (50. txt files in a. zip file measuring ~ 58 MB in total) contain the following columns: (1) Fully Qualified Class Name; (2) Metric Name (We use the abbreviations as defined in Chapter 4); (3) a list of metric values for each release of the software.

We have used a radionuclide technique to assess solid and liquid gastric emptying in 14 patients with endoscopically proven duodenal ulcer and 22 healthy controls. Solid gastric <b>emptying</b> <b>values</b> for the patient group fell within the normal range. The median time taken for 50 % (T 50) of the liquid marker to empty from the stomach was 12 minutes (range 6 - 23 minutes) which was significantly faster (p less than. 005) than controls (median 18 minutes, range 11 - 35).

40|$|An {{immutable}} multi-map is a many-to-many thread-friendly {{map data}} structure with expected fast insert and lookup operations. This data structure {{is used for}} applications processing graphs or many-to-many relations as applied in static analysis of object-oriented systems. When processing such big data sets the memory overhead of the data structure encoding itself is a memory usage bottleneck. Motivated by reuse and type-safety, libraries for Java, Scala and Clojure typically implement immutable multi-maps by nesting sets as the values with the keys of a trie map. Like this, based on our measurements the expected byte overhead for a sparse multi-map per stored entry adds up to around 65 B, which renders it unfeasible to compute with effectively on the JVM. In this {{paper we propose a}} general framework for Hash-Array Mapped Tries on the JVM which can store type-heterogeneous keys and values: a Heterogeneous Hash-Array Mapped Trie (HHAMT). Among other applications, this allows for a highly efficient multi-map encoding by (a) not reserving space for <b>empty</b> <b>value</b> sets and (b) inlining the values of singleton sets while maintaining a (c) type-safe API. We detail the necessary encoding and optimizations to mitigate the overhead of storing and retrieving heterogeneous data in a hash-trie. Furthermore, we evaluate HHAMT specifically for the application to multi-maps, comparing them to state-of-the-art encodings of multi-maps in Java, Scala and Clojure. We isolate key differences using microbenchmarks and validate the resulting conclusions on a real world case in static analysis. The new encoding brings the per key-value storage overhead down to 30 B: a 2 x improvement. With additional inlining of primitive values it reaches a 4 x improvement...|$|R
