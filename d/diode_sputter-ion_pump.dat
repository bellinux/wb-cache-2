50|$|The {{sorption}} pump is a vacuum pump {{that creates a}} vacuum by adsorbing molecules on a very porous material like molecular sieve which is cooled by a cryogen, typically liquid nitrogen. The ultimate pressure is about 10−2 mbar. With special techniques this can be lowered till 10−7 mbar. The main advantages are the absence of oil or other contaminants, low cost and vibration free operation {{because there are no}} moving parts. The main disadvantages are that it cannot operate continuously and cannot effectively pump hydrogen, helium and neon, all gases with lower condensation temperature than liquid nitrogen. The main application is as a roughing <b>pump</b> for a <b>sputter-ion</b> <b>pump</b> in ultra-high vacuum experiments, for example in surface physics.|$|R
40|$|The {{vacuum system}} for the {{proposed}} e+e- storage ring CESR must handle the high power-density of synchrotron radiation hitting the walls, and the vacuum chamber must be designed to minimize "higher-mode " losses due to beam-induced RF fields.

The vacuum {{system for the}} e+e- storage ring CESR' is designed to maintain an average pressure of about 10 m 8 Torr {{in the presence of}} circulating electron and positron beams of 100 mA each.

40|$|This paper {{mentions}} {{first the}} requirement of ultra-high vacuum (UHV) for storage rings with colliding beams, and then describes how, in the mid- 1950 's, the fast development of UHV technology made {{the construction of the}} Intersecting Storage Rings (ISR) possible with their 2 km of vacuum pipes at 10 /sup - 11 / Torr. The performance features are discussed with special emphasis on the problem of stimulated gas desorption from chamber walls. The placing of contracts for <b>sputter-ion</b> <b>pumps</b> and the need for developing sector valves at CERN is mentioned to illustrate that there was some feedback from these constructions to the general development of UHV. Finally, some problems and solutions are listed which are common to other fields where UHV is used: namely in thermonuclear fusion, space research, and manufacturing of integrated circuits...|$|R
40|$|The {{first four}} {{insertion}} device (ID) vacuum chambers (3 for the undulators, 1 for the wiggler) have been {{installed in the}} ELETTRA synchrotron radiation facility. Each chamber is 4. 8 m in length and has a rectangular cross section with a cylindrical antechamber. The whole system is pumped by four 120 l/s <b>sputter-ion</b> <b>pumps</b> of nominal pumping speed. The insertion device chambers are fabricated from stainless steel ESR AISI 316 LN. This material was chosen for its very low relative magnetic permeability (~ 1. 003), its high yield stress and the well known procedures for welding and cleaning. Vacuum and mass spectroscopy experience {{during the first year}} of commissioning is presented. 1. INTRODUCTION Elettra synchrotron radiation facility has been built expecially for the use of high brilliance radiation from insertion devices ID. The storage ring of 260 m in circumference is equipped by 12 straight sections, one is for beam injection, 11 are for IDs beam lines. An austenitic stainless ste [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Ten long {{straight}} {{vacuum chambers}} for insertion devices (ID) are currently installed at ELETTRA. Four different types are employed: a) four stainless steel (SS) vacuum chambers with a rectangular cross section 80 mm x (17 - 20) mm, pumped by two central 120 l/s <b>sputter-ion</b> <b>pumps</b> connected to an antechamber; b) one pump free SS vacuum chamber with an elliptical {{cross section of}} 82 mm x 14. 8 mm; c) four pump free extruded aluminum vacuum chambers with an elliptical cross section of 81 mm x 14 mm; d) one pump free extruded aluminum vacuum chamber of the same cross section, coated with a low temperature activation NEG. Results of standard laboratory vacuum tests will be discussed. Vacuum measurements during commissioning, such as dynamic pressure and Bremsstrahlung (BS) radiation, are also reported. The lifetime variation due to {{the reduction of the}} total pressure for all types of ID chambers will be compared. 1 TYPES OF ID VACUUM CHAMBERS The ID chamber is a low conductance vacuum system. During machine operation its inner surface is exposed to an intense flux of synchrotron radiation. Consequently the local pressure rises; above a certain threshold other than reducing the beam lifetime, an unacceptable level of gas bremsstrahlung is exceeded. Besides the mechanical requirements, the design of an efficient ID vacuum chamber should take into account at least the following aspects: 1) the effective pumping speed should be as high as possible (this necessity is in contrast with the required small cross section of the chamber), 2) the outgassing rate should be low; materials and cleaning procedures have to be chosen carefully, 3) the photon stimulated desorption should be as low as possible. The ELETTRA storage ring (SR) contains twelve long straight sections: ten are currently equipped with ID’s (see Tab. 1), one is reserved for future special components, and the last one is used for injection. Each ID chamber is connected to the SR by means of two vacuum vessels, which joint the rhomboidal cross section of the SR to the elliptical or rectangular internal shape of the ID chamber. Each of these vessel hosts a 120 l/s <b>sputter-ion</b> <b>pump</b> (SIP) and an inverted magnetron gaug...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} of pumping speed measurement method was made using {{three types of}} apparatus. These were: (i) the Fischer-Mommsen system, developed at CERN in which the gas flow rate {{is measured by the}} pressure drop across an orifice of known conductance at the test vessel inlet and the pressure gauge is arrayed to serve as a molecular flux transducer, (ii) the three gauge system used by some pump manufacturers in which the gas flow rate is determined by measuring the pressure drop across a long tube whose conductance is calculated from its dimensions and (iii) the constant pressure/pipette system in which the time is measured to evacuate a known quantity of gas. A <b>sputter-ion</b> <b>pump</b> with Ti and Ta cathodes and 32 Penning cells was used as the test pump. The Fischer and Mommsen and pipette procedures gave good agreement for the pumping speeds of N/sub 2 / (within 1 %) but allowance had to be made for mass discrimination in the gas flow through an orifice when air was pumped. The three gauge method consistently gave a pumping speed of 8 % higher. (15 refs) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a miniaturized Penning cell array for on-chip <b>sputter-ion</b> vacuum <b>pumping.</b> The effects of miniaturization on pumping performance – including cut-off magnetic flux, pumping rate, and minimum operating pressure – are examined. The pump is experimentally shown to reduce pressure by 600 mTorr (80 Pa) from a starting pressure of 18 Torr (2. 4 kPa) in 30 minutes of operation. The rate of molecular removal is typically 3 - 15 x 1013 molecules per second. The architecture allows device operation at pressures {{at least as}} low as 70 mTorr (9. 3 Pa), representing an improvement of two orders of magnitude over previously reported micro-sputter-ion pumps...|$|R
40|$|A new {{apparatus}} {{was constructed}} to examine gas-, atom- and Plasma-driven permeation of hydrogen isotopes through group VA metal membranes with precisely controlled surface states. Absorption and desorption experiments are also possible. The new apparatus {{consists of two}} vacuum chambers, an upstream chamber and a downstream chamber, separated by a specimen membrane. Both chambers are evacuated by turbo-molecular <b>pumps</b> and <b>sputter-ion</b> <b>pumps.</b> The upstream chamber is equipped with Ta filaments serving as atomizers in atom-driven permeation experiments and cathodes in plasma-driven permeation experiments. The specimen membrane is formed into a tubular and electrically isolated from the chamber. Hence, ohmic heating of the membrane is possible, and this feature of the membrane is suitable for surface cleaning by high-temperature heating and impurity doping for the control of surface chemical composition through surface segregation. Both chambers were evacuated to 1 x 10 - 7 Pa after baking. The main component of residual gas was H 2, and the partial pressures of impurity gases other than H 2 were ca. 1 x 10 - 8 Pa. Gas- and atom-driven permeation experiments were successfully carried out with hydrogen gas for Nb membrane activated by heating in vacuum at 1173 K. Superpermeation was observed in the atom-driven permeation experiments. Absorption experiments with a clean surface were also carried out. The surface was, however, cleaned only partially, because the temperature distribution was not uniform during high-temperature heating. Nevertheless, surface cleanliness was retained during absorption experiments under the present vacuum conditions. A new membrane assembly that will enable a uniform temperature distribution is now under construction...|$|R
40|$|Microdischarges {{offer an}} {{alternative}} and often advantageous sensing and actuation method {{that has not been}} significantly exploited in microtransducers. This thesis explores the capabilities of microdischarges to address problems such as cavity pressure control, cavity pressure detection, and purity control of fill gases, which are relevant to microsystems. Microdischarge-based transducers have been developed for these purposes. One interesting aspect of microdischarge-based transducers is the wide latitude of operating temperatures, as they are advantageous for room and high temperature operation. 	On-chip <b>sputter-ion</b> <b>pumps</b> control the pressure and gas purity in cavities. They consist of thin-film titanium electrodes patterned on glass substrates. Microdischarges sputter the cathodes, resulting in the selective chemisorption of titanium-reactive gases. Using DC discharges, these devices have reduced the pressure by 168 Torr in an air-filled, hermetically sealed, 6. 33 cm 3 package. Starting at 200 Torr, the pressure reduction rate of air is 7. 2 Torr/h; oxygen 11. 5 Torr/h, and nitrogen 3. 4 Torr/h. Relative humidity is reduced at 6 %/h. The pumps do not remove helium, purifying gas environments by selectively removing contaminating nitrogen and oxygen. A theoretical model outlining the dependency of gas removal rates on microdischarge parameters is presented. 	Microdischarge-based pressure sensors operate by correlating the measured change in spatial current distribution of pulsed DC microdischarges with pressure. One sensor version uses three-dimensional arrays of horizontal bulk metal electrodes embedded in quartz substrates with electrode diameters of 1 - 2 mm and 50 - 100 µm inter-electrode spacing. These devices have been operated over 10 - 2, 000 Torr, at temperatures as high as 1, 000 ˚C. The maximum measured sensitivity is 5, 420 ppm/Torr, while the minimum temperature coefficient of sensitivity is - 550 ppm/K. Sensors of a second version use planar electrodes, with 0. 13 mm 2 active areas. 	To explore the utility of pressure controlling devices, these transducers are combined with an optical emission sensor to create a high temperature gas phase chemical detection microsystem. The microdischarge-based pressure sensor determines the sample and backfilling gas pressure while the microscale-sputter-ion pump purifies the gas environment. The contaminating nitrogen concentration has been reduced by 56. 5 x relative to helium and the spectral detection limit has been improved by 8 x for carbon at 200 °C...|$|R
