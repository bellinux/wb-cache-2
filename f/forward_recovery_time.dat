5000|$|Time Machine, an {{automated}} backup utility {{which allows the}} user to restore files that have been deleted or replaced by another version of a file. Though generally lauded in the press as a step <b>forward</b> for data <b>recovery,</b> <b>Time</b> Machine has been criticized in multiple publications for lacking the capabilities of third-party backup software. Analyzing the feature for TidBITS, Joe Kissell pointed out that Time Machine does not create bootable copies of backed-up volumes, does not back up to AirPort Disk hard drives and will not back up FileVault encrypted home directories until the user logs out, concluding that the feature is [...] "pretty good at what it does" [...] but he will only use {{it as part of}} a [...] "broader backup strategy". One of these issues has been resolved, however; On March 19, 2008, updates were released for AirPort and Time Machine, allowing for Time Machine to use a USB hard disk which has been connected to an AirPort Extreme Base Station.|$|R
30|$|Error {{recovery}} {{is the process}} in which the erroneous state is substituted with an error-free state (Lee and Anderson [1990]). Error {{recovery is}} performed using either backward <b>recovery</b> or <b>forward</b> <b>recovery.</b> On the one hand, backward recovery attempts to return the system to a correct or error-free state by restoring or rolling back the system to a previously saved state, which is assumed to be error-free. On the other hand, <b>forward</b> <b>recovery</b> attempts to return the system to a correct or error-free state by finding a new state from which the system can continue operation. Compared to backward error <b>recovery,</b> <b>forward</b> <b>recovery</b> is usually more efficient in terms of the overhead (e.g. time and memory) it imposes (Lee and Anderson [1990]). On the other hand, it is usually not possible to design general <b>forward</b> <b>recovery</b> mechanisms.|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{distributed}} execution of recovery blocks is examined as an approach for uniform treatment of {{hardware and software}} faults. A useful characteristic of the approach is the relatively small time cost it requires. The approach is thus suitable for incorporation into real-time computer systems. A specific formulation of the approach that is aimed at minimizing the <b>recovery</b> <b>time</b> is presented, called the distributed recovery block (DRB) scheme. The DRB scheme is capable of effecting <b>forward</b> <b>recovery</b> while handling both hardware and software faults in a uniform manner. An approach to incorporating the capability for multiprocessing scheme is also discussed. Two experiments aimed at testing the execution efficiency of the scheme in real-time applications have been conducted on two different multimicrocomputer networks.

40|$|Very-fast high-current pulses {{that occur}} during charged device model (CDM) ESD events lead to {{transient}} voltage overshoots in forward- and reverse-biased pn-junctions, called <b>forward</b> <b>recovery</b> and dynamic reverse overshoot. To improve the device modeling for CDM circuit simulation of integrated circuits, these effects should be fully understood {{and should be}} implemented in the device models. In this paper the effects are studied under the CDM relevant operating conditions by experimental characterization and device simulation.

A simple compact model extension to include the <b>forward</b> <b>recovery</b> effect in diode models is presented. A novel parameter extraction method that uses the transient TDR signals of the very-fast TLP method is introduced.

30|$|Two {{previous}} studies [23, 50] show that longer traffic incident duration {{can result in}} longer <b>recovery</b> <b>times,</b> leading to severe congestion. Travelers must generally know how long the <b>recovery</b> <b>time</b> will be {{so that they can}} select the suitable route to their destination. Detecting the <b>recovery</b> <b>time</b> was previously difficult because of the limitations in the fixed traffic detectors; few studies consider the <b>recovery</b> <b>time</b> [23]. The development of several emerging traffic-condition detection techniques currently provides an opportunity to detect or infer the <b>recovery</b> <b>time</b> duration. For example, INRIX or Baidu in China can provide real-time traffic conditions mostly based on floating car data of taxis, trucks, coaches, and other vehicle types. Such information can be used to infer the <b>recovery</b> <b>time</b> duration of an incident, and sometimes the simulation dynamic traffic assignment tool is also needed. One of the difficulties with this inference is how to identify the congestion cause, that is, whether the congestion is due to the incident independently or caused by other factors (e.g., recurrent congestion). Investigating the significant factors that influence the <b>recovery</b> <b>time</b> are possible with the <b>recovery</b> <b>time</b> data, which can be helpful in adopting appropriate traffic management strategies to reduce the incident influence. Thus, determining a proper method to infer or detect the <b>recovery</b> <b>time</b> and corresponding method to analyse and predict it can be a future topic. An appropriate traffic theory model or method based on simulations may provide effective means to infer the <b>recovery</b> <b>time</b> of traffic flow conditions.|$|R

These movements and posture conditions are causal factors of work related musculoskeletal disorders. This dissertation develops and provides supporting evidence for a conceptual model that describes {{the conditions under which}} workers of mixed-model assembly lines (MMALs) with cycle to cycle task variations are exposed to awkward postures and insufficient <b>recovery</b> <b>time.</b> To evaluate the effect of variations on worker posture and <b>recovery</b> <b>time,</b> an observation study was conducted. It found that the workstation with the most variations had 89 % less <b>recovery</b> <b>time</b> and 57 % more reaching outside the normal reach ranges than the workstation with the least. A discrete event simulation model of this system was created to predict work time and frequency of worker reaching upstream/downstream to complete the assigned tasks {{for a longer period of}} time. It may also be used to evaluate the changes in the assembly line parameters. A second study was conducted in the laboratory. In it, subjects’ <b>recovery</b> <b>time</b> and frequency of reaching outside the normal reach ranges were tested under 3 conveyor types and 3 product mix/sequence configurations. It found that the asynchronous indexing conveyor reduced reaching the most (19 % vs. 63 %) but none of the configurations provided sufficient <b>recovery</b> <b>time</b> (< 5 %).
