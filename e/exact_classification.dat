25|$|The various Turkic {{languages}} are usually considered in geographical groupings: the Oghuz (or Southwestern) languages, the Kypchak (or Northwestern) languages, the Eastern languages (like Uygur), the Northern languages (like Altay and Yakut), and one existing Oghur language: Chuvash (the other Oghur languages, like Hunnic and Bulgaric, are now extinct). The high mobility and intermixing of Turkic peoples in history makes an <b>exact</b> <b>classification</b> extremely difficult.|$|E
25|$|The orca, wolf, raven, spider, whale, were revered animals. Also {{folklore}} (e.g. tale) examples demonstrate this. For example, {{a spider}} saves {{the life of}} a girl. The motif of spider as a benevolent personage, saving people from peril with its cobweb, lifting them up to the sky in danger, is present also in many tales of Sireniki Eskimos (as mentioned, their <b>exact</b> <b>classification</b> inside Eskimo peoples is not settled yet).|$|E
25|$|Today {{almost all}} {{scholars}} share {{the view that}} the text was written in a Turkic language, but it has not been deciphered and the <b>exact</b> <b>classification</b> of the language has been a subject of debate. It has been often compared with the Turkic Bulgar language of the First Bulgarian Empire, attested on several 8th-9th century inscriptions found in north-eastern Bulgaria and written in Greek letters. More recently Eugene Helimski argued the language is close to Proto-Tungusic, but this proposal was rejected by Marcel Erdal as far-fetched.|$|E

50|$|Due {{to large}} {{physical}} variations in Cebus, taxonomists have frequently debated the <b>exact</b> <b>classifications</b> and {{details of the}} genus. However, most agree that the wedge-capped capuchin shares the genus with four others: C. apella, C. albifrons, C. capucinus, and C. kaapori. The wedge-capped capuchin has a diploid chromosome number of 52, though some others in the genus have 54 chromosomes. Nine human chromosomes correspond {{to those of the}} C. olivaceus. Phylogenetic analysis and constructions of cladograms have demonstrated that the wedge-capped capuchin is closely related to C. apella.|$|R

25|$|Since {{active sonar}} reveals the {{presence}} and position of the operator, and does not allow <b>exact</b> <b>classification</b> of targets, it is used by fast (planes, helicopters) and by noisy platforms (most surface ships) but rarely by submarines. When active sonar is used by surface ships or submarines, it is typically activated very briefly at intermittent periods {{to minimize the risk}} of detection. Consequently, active sonar is normally considered a backup to passive sonar. In aircraft, active sonar is used in the form of disposable sonobuoys that are dropped in the aircraft's patrol area or in the vicinity of possible enemy sonar contacts.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{problems}} with <b>exact</b> <b>classification</b> of the Khazar language. One {{of the basic}} issues is the vague nature of the name Khazar itself. It {{has not yet been}} determined whether it refers to a specific Turkish tribe, or if it had a political and geographical origin that was not ethnolinguistic. The Khazar realm was a polyglot (multi lingual) and polyethnic (multicultural) state, with Iranian, Finnic, Ugric, Slavic, and North Caucasian languages. According to anthropological data, it was ruled by Inner Asian Mongoloid (with some Europoid somatic elements) core tribes that accompanied the dynasty. The Turkic tribes probably spoke a number of Turkic languages. Scholars considered it a possibility that the term Khazar denoted one or even several languages; however, the sources cannot determine the extent of its use.|$|E

40|$|Further {{improvements}} on {{the novel}} method for state of charge (SOC) determination of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells based on the impedance spectra classification are presented. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is applied to impedance spectra of a LFP cell, with each impedance spectrum representing a distinct SOC for a predefined temperature. As a SVM is a binary classifier, only the distinction between two SOC can be computed in one iteration of the algorithm. Therefore a search pattern is necessary. A balanced tree search was implemented with good results. In order to further improvements of the SVM method, this paper discusses two new search pattern, namely a linear search and an imbalanced tree search, the later one based on an initial educated guess. All three search pattern were compared under various aspects like accuracy, efficiency, tolerance of disturbances and temperature dependancy. The imbalanced search tree shows {{to be the most}} efficient search pattern if the initial guess is within less than ± 5  % SOC of the original SOC in both directions and exhibits the best tolerance for high disturbances. Linear search improves the rate of <b>exact</b> <b>classifications</b> for almost every temperature. It also improves the robustness against high disturbances and can even detect a certain number of false classifications which makes this search pattern unique. The downside is a much lower efficiency as all impedance spectra have to be evaluated while the tree search pattern only evaluate those on the tree path...|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} decade or two, the Internet has {{witnessed}} an ever escalating demand for protection against unwanted traffic, including those carrying out malicious attacks. Packet filtering has been universally deployed in firewalls to serve as the first defense frontier against such unwanted traffic. Thus far in practice, packet filtering in firewalls has followed the conventional paradigm of <b>exact</b> packet <b>classification,</b> in which every packet has to be classified exactly conforming to the complete set of defined rules. However, under heavy traffic load due to unusually large traffic bursts or malicious attacks, performing <b>exact</b> packet <b>classification</b> sometimes incurs load that far exceeds the firewall?s capacity. It is not rare for firewalls to crash under such circumstances, causing considerable loss of important data and extended periods of service disruption. In this paper, we propose the first robust scheme for approximate packet classification, which dynamically adjusts the rules to be evaluated at runtime as a function of system load, so as to reduce the drop rate and delay of legitimate packets at the firewall while still being conservative enough in filtering all unwanted packets. Through extensive simulations based on firewall rule sets and traffic logs managed by a large tier- 1 ISP, we demonstrate that our proposed solution can reduce legitimate packet drop rate by as much as an order of magnitude and hence significantly improve the robustness of the firewall, especially under high traffic loads...|$|R
