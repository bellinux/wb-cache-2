5|$|One year later, Crash {{is living}} with his younger sister Coco on N. Sanity Island, one of the islands owned by Cortex in the {{previous}} game. After Coco's laptop battery dies, she forces a sleeping Crash to <b>get</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> new one. While doing so, Crash is abducted by a bright light and finds himself in an old Warp Room hidden in Cortex's castle, where a holographic projection of Cortex instructs him to bring him the crystals by traveling through the Warp Room's doors. After Crash collects a crystal, Cortex informs Crash of the upcoming destructive force and assigns him the task of bringing all of the crystals to him so that he may contain it. After retrieving a gem, Crash is greeted by a hologram from Doctor Nitrus Brio, Cortex's former assistant from the previous game, who is now out to stop Cortex's plans for world domination. Brio explains that the Earth contains gems in addition to crystals, and that collecting 42 gems will allow Brio to fire a laser beam that can destroy the Cortex Vortex.|$|E

500|$|Davidson, {{perhaps on}} the basis of his {{youthful}} Thames-side rescue, had convinced himself that nearly all young girls alone in London were in need of rescue from a life of vice. [...] Typical of these was Rose Ellis, whom he met in Leicester Square in September 1920. Twenty years old and living precariously from part-time prostitution, she was homeless and had no money. Davidson gave her cash for a room, and arranged to meet her the following week. Thus began a friendship that endured for more than a decade. Davidson brought her to the rectory, where she worked for a time in the gardens. He also tried to <b>get</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> job with a touring theatre company, took her to Paris to find employment as an au pair, kept her supplied with small sums of money, and paid her medical bills when she was suffering from venereal disease.|$|E

500|$|In 1982, the 24-year-old Madonna {{was living}} in New York and {{trying to set up}} her music career. She was joined by her boyfriend from Detroit, Steve Bray, who became the drummer of her band, The Breakfast Club, which {{generally}} played hard-rock music. After that, however, they abandoned playing songs in the hard-rock genre and got signed by a music management company called Gotham Records with the plan of pursuing a new musical direction. They decided to pursue the funk genre but the record company was not happy with their musical abilities, hence they were dropped, and Madonna and Bray left the band. Meanwhile, Madonna had written and developed some songs on her own. She carried rough tapes of three of the songs, namely [...] "Everybody", [...] "Ain't No Big Deal" [...] and [...] "Burning Up". At that time, she frequented the Danceteria nightclub in New York. It was there that Madonna convinced the DJ Mark Kamins to play [...] "Everybody" [...] for the crowd, and the song received a positive reaction. Kamins offered to <b>get</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> record deal with the understanding that he would produce the single.

500|$|Kesha's {{deliberately}} unpolished {{aesthetic and}} juvenile stage persona, which she described {{as her own}} personality [...] "times ten", quickly made her a deeply polarizing figure. Some of her critics found her output to be unsophisticated, while others {{felt that she was}} manufactured and lacked credibility. Kesha's former managers from DAS Communications Inc. filed a lawsuit later that month, seeking $14million from Kesha and $12million from Luke for commissions on her RCA Records deal, alleging that she had extended the deadline for them to <b>get</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> major record label contract and squeezed them out of her career under pressure from Dr. Luke. Kesha launched her own lawsuit in October, citing the California-exclusive Talent Agencies Act and asking the California Labor Commissioner to declare her contract with DAS void because it had acted as an unlicensed talent agent while procuring work for her in California, where only licensed agents can do so. The case was settled in 2012 before the release of her second album. Kesha held a benefit concert on June 16, 2010, where all proceeds went to aid victims of the May 2010 Tennessee floods from her hometown Nashville. She raised close to $70,000 from the event. She was a supporting act on the summer North American leg of Rihanna's Last Girl on Earth Tour and was awarded Best New Act at the 2010 MTV Europe Music Awards.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{being made}} a pariah, Brian is banned from every bar and {{convenience}} store in Quahog, {{making it impossible}} for him to drink. Desperate, and suffering from delirium tremens (he hallucinates seeing several alcoholic beverages begging him to drink them), Brian fakes his repentance and convinces Meg to cease all hostilities against him so he can get back to drinking, but she takes him to burn books that are [...] "harmful to God" [...] (including On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin, A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking, and a book titled Logic for First Graders). A disgusted Brian admits his bluff and attempts to convince Meg that what she is doing is wrong. When Meg refuses to listen, Brian points out to her that if there were truly a loving God, then he would not have created Meg to have an attractive mother like Lois but have her be unattractive like Peter, and that she would not be living with a family that holds her in contempt and otherwise pretends that she does not exist (along with not even caring enough about her to <b>get</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> mumps shot). Feeling ashamed, Meg concedes to Brian's argument and apologizes for her behavior, confessing that she does not know how she can feel loved. Brian then assures her that the answers are inside herself, and the real meaning of their existence is out there somewhere. Afterward, it is revealed that the entire Family Guy universe takes place within the molecules of a lampshade in the shared bedroom of Adam West and Rob Lowe.|$|E

[...] A social event at the Chinese Legation in 1887 caused a scandal. [...] A ball was held with 400 invitations issued, but over 1,500 people made their way into the building resulting in the local press describing it as a [...] "mob." [...] Attendees were unable to move for hours, Chinese ornaments were broken or lost, guests lost their wraps and overcoats, and one senator was separated from his wife for over two hours after leaving to <b>get</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> refreshment.|$|E
