In 1904, he left the Weather Bureau, and with financial backing from businessman John Scruggs Brown, he launched the Fulton Company to market sylphon-based products. [...] One of the company's first successful products was a <b>damper</b> <b>regulator</b> for boilers that used a sylphon to automatically adjust the damper position as the temperature changed. [...] The earliest automobile thermostats used sylphons for actuation. [...] By 1940, over 50 millions sylphons were in daily use the United States alone.|$|E

40|$|Grid {{connected}} PWM inverters/rectifiers inevitably {{produce a}} high frequency switched {{common mode voltage}} on their DC bus, which can cause substantial EMI problems. The mitigation strategy proposed in {{this paper is to}} couple the Y point of the LCL filter capacitors to the DC bus mid-point to connect a virtual neutral to the DC bus, which significantly reduces the high frequency common mode voltages on the bus. However, additional common mode inductances and capacitances are required for this filter, to limit high frequency circulating currents and define the EMI filter breakpoint. Also, the converter current regulator must be split into differential and common mode sections, to eliminate phase coupling between the phase leg active <b>damping</b> current <b>regulators,</b> and to support damping of the common mode EMI filter resonance. The concept is verified by simulations and experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper investigates {{and compares}} {{performance}} of various conventional and fuzzy logic based controllers at generator locations for oscillation damping. Performance of combination of conventional and fuzzy logic based controllers also studied by comparing overshoot on the active power deviation response {{for a small}} disturbance and damping ratio of the critical mode. Fuzzy logic based controllers can not be modeled in the state space form to get the eigenvalues and corresponding damping ratios of various modes of generators and controllers. Hence, a new method based on tracing envelop of time domain waveform is also presented and used in the paper for comparing performance of controllers. The paper also shows that if the fuzzy based controllers designed separately combining them could {{not lead to a}} better performance.

40|$|BK {{channels}} {{are composed of}} α-subunits, which form a voltage- and Ca 2 +-gated potassium channel, and of modulatory β-subunits. The β 1 -subunit is expressed in smooth muscle, where it renders the BK channel sensitive to [Ca 2 +]i in a voltage range near the smooth-muscle resting potential and slows activation and deactivation. BK channel acts thereby as a <b>damped</b> feedback <b>regulator</b> of voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels and of smooth muscle tone. We explored the contacts between α and β 1 by determining the extent of endogenous disulfide bond formation between cysteines substituted just extracellular to the two β 1 transmembrane (TM) helices, TM 1 and TM 2, and to the seven α TM helices, consisting of S 1 –S 6, conserved in all voltage-dependent potassium channels, and the unique S 0 helix, which we previously concluded was partly surrounded by S 1 –S 4. We now find that the extracellular ends of β 1 TM 2 and α S 0 are in contact and that β 1 TM 1 is close to both S 1 and S 2. The extracellular ends of TM 1 and TM 2 are not close to S 3 –S 6. In almost all cases, cross-linking of TM 2 to S 0 or of TM 1 to S 1 or S 2 shifted the conductance–voltage curves toward more positive potentials, slowed activation, and speeded deactivation, and in general favored the closed state. TM 1 and TM 2 are in position to contribute, {{in concert with the}} extracellular loop and the intracellular N- and C-terminal tails of β 1, to the modulation of BK channel function...|$|R

Therefore,it has important significance to study the precision permanent magnet AC servo drive system to improve the electromechanical coupling vibration of the dynamic performance of the system,in order to reveal the mechanism, master them, and thus to control and use. This chapter from the global coupled electromechanical system point of view, firstly it constructed a three-mass two-axis vibration of the system mathematical model of electromechanical coupling, and then create a three-mass two-axis vibration simulation model of electromechanical coupling, and finally the electromechanical coupling vibration characteristics are analyzed. ...|$|R
40|$|Two {{important}} {{components of}} a grid connected power electronic converter are the line filter and the closed loop current regulator. Together they are largely responsible for system stability, power flow and power quality into the grid. The LCL filter is a smaller and cheaper line filter alternative because of its third order filtering capability. However the LCL filter has a resonance that must be appropriately damped using either passive or active techniques, generating more losses or adding complexity to the controller respectively. It is now generally accepted that the PWM transport delay due to discrete/digital implementations is the main limiting factor for controller bandwidth in L filtered systems. However, despite the large body of literature for the LCL filter, there is still only limited consensus regarding the implications of PWM transport delay on the current <b>regulator</b> and active <b>damping</b> controller {{for this type of}} filter. This thesis applies discrete time models to these systems to overcome these perceived limitations and hence develop the optimal controllers. This knowledge is then used to enhance the current regulator to overcome further practical problems. The first part of this thesis focuses on the development of discrete time current regulation for a grid connected inverter. The benefits of discrete time modelling and control for current regulation are demonstrated by using a discrete state feedback controller for an L filter system. A precise discrete time model of the LCL filter system is then developed to exactly identify the frequency region where active damping is mandatory, and the high frequency region where active damping is not required. The critical frequency, which separates these two regions, is identified as a fraction of the sampling frequency, demonstrating the controller&# 039;s dependence on PWM transport delay. Controllers and gain selection methods are developed and verified for each region. A generalised approach for analysis of the LCL filtered system is then developed so that all forms can be evaluated on a precisely comparable basis. Using this generalised approach the particular advantages and disadvantages of each control method are readily identified. The second part of this thesis looks at the impact of two practical issues for current regulation of LCL filtered grid connected converters. It firstly identifies that practical converters generally do not match their ideal output current quality expectations. The reasons for this distortion are explained and harmonic compensators are then proposed as an effective solution to overcome it. Secondly the implications of a virtual neutral common mode EMI filter on the current regulator are investigated. A virtual neutral filter design is proposed that utilises the primary LCL filter components. The active <b>damping</b> current <b>regulator</b> is then enhanced to avoid interference from the additional current path and to actively damp the common mode resonance. All theoretical work is validated by extensive simulation and experimental results...|$|R
