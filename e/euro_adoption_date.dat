As a third requirement, participation in the exchange-rate mechanism (ERM / ERM II) under the European Monetary System (EMS) for two consecutive years is expected, though according to the Commission [...] "exchange rate stability during a period of non-participation before entering ERM II can be taken into account." [...] For example, Italy was deemed to have converged with only 15 months as an ERM-member, as measured on the last day in the review period of the convergence report. Meanwhile, the European Commission concluded that for Cyprus, Malta and Latvia, their 18 months of membership in the review period ending on 31 October 2006 was insufficient. As of 2014, all 29 times the subcriteria for ERM-membership length was found complied with by the Commission, these cases had the particular observation in common, that the state had surpassed minimum two full years of ERM-membership either ahead of the [...] "final approval date (following approximately 1.5 month after the publication of the convergence report) where their currency exchange rate would be irrevocably fixed by the Council of the European Union" [...] or by the [...] "first possible <b>euro</b> <b>adoption</b> <b>date</b> following the publication of the convergence report".|$|E

For this purpose, the empirical research among foreign tourists in Slovenia was conducted on {{their perceptions of the}} <b>Euro</b> <b>adoption</b> in Slovenia {{during the second half of}} 2007. The multivari-ate factor analysis was performed, which confirmed the four common dimensions of the Euro impacts on Slovenian tourism: attractiveness, costs, expensiveness, and comparison. The mean values of the ana-lyzed items indicate the most positive impacts of the Euro on the direct price comparison and the easiness of comparison among tourist des-tinations in the Euro zone. The empirical results suggest that the <b>Euro</b> <b>adoption</b> has had the greatest impacts on better comparisons among tourist destinations in the Euro zone, followed by a significant decline in travel-operational costs. The increase in the expensiveness of the des-tination among foreign tourists is confirmed, whereas no significant improvement in the attractiveness of Slovenia as a tourist destination was proved after the <b>Euro</b> <b>adoption.</b> Key Words: the <b>Euro</b> <b>adoption,</b> European Union, Slovenian tourism, multivariate factor analysi...|$|R

The Czech Republic lie under an obligation to adopt the euro and solve the arguments for and against early entry to the Euroarea at this time. The issue will be solved {{from the perspective of}} <b>euro</b> <b>adoption</b> in Slovakia. Both of the republics had the "same" default position seventeen years ago. Why is Slovakia the member of the Euroarea and why not the Czech Republic?

In order to carry out this analysis, we also estimate the time-varying natural rate of interest purged from the risk premium. Our results suggest that the costs arising from the discontinuation of nominal trend appreciation of the koruna after <b>euro</b> <b>adoption</b> are likely to be rather low. In contrast, a low inflation environment and a harmonization of the business cycles between the Czech Republic and the euro area are essential for ensuring that inflation hikes will remain limited after the <b>euro</b> <b>adoption.</b> The fulfilment of the Maastricht inflation criterion should not be enforced by policy measures that would artificially reduce inflation temporarily.
