25|$|Much of BBC Two's output has {{previously}} or subsequently been shown on other channels. Some of these programmes are repeats of popular or flagship programmes from BBC Four in {{a late night}} strand, originally called BBC Four on Two but now unbranded, {{for the benefit of}} audiences without access to BBC Four. Other programmes are moved to the channel {{as a result of their}} success on BBC Three or Four, so that subsequent series are well received. An example of this is the BBC Three series Torchwood that was transferred to the channel following the success of the first series. BBC Two is also used as a testing ground for programmes prior to their moving to the flagship BBC One: such examples include Have I Got News <b>for</b> <b>You</b> <b>and</b> popular comedies Absolutely Fabulous and Miranda, which moved to BBC One after success on Two. Also in August 2014 The Great British Bake Off moved to BBC One due to its success the previous year on BBC Two.|$|E
