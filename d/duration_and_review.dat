40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the duration of}} capital account crises. We develop a new index to identify both the start {{and the end of}} these crises. Applying the index to a sample of 18 crisis episodes, we derive stylized facts on crisis <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> <b>review</b> the economic and financial circumstances that prevailed at the dusk of crises, a relatively unexplored area. We use the econometric technique of duration analysis to gauge the relative importance of various factors affecting the probability of exiting a crisis. We find that initial and external conditions are key determinants. But fiscal and monetary policies can also help shorten crisis duration. ...|$|E
40|$|Several {{approaches}} to response to intervention (RTI) de-scribed {{in the literature}} could be blended into an RTI model that would be effective in the schools. An effective RTI model should employ three fundamental variables: (a) systematic data collection to identify students in need, (b) effective implementation of interventions for ade-quate <b>durations,</b> <b>and</b> (c) <b>review</b> of student progress data to determine when and/or if more intensive serv-ices are warranted. Research regarding RTI elements such as intervention time, intervention duration, treat-ment efficacy, intervention group size, measurement of student progress, and decision analyses is reviewed.

40|$|The {{use of the}} {{exchange}} rate concept for predicting {{noise induced hearing loss}} based on noise level <b>and</b> <b>duration</b> was <b>reviewed</b> <b>and</b> discussed. The selection of an appropriate exchange rate necessitates examining the growth of equal hearing hazard as a function of noise level <b>and</b> <b>duration.</b> This relationship depends on numerous variables, including the measure of damage, the audiometric frequencies to be protected, and various temporal and acoustic parameters such as the noise on time and off time and the level of quiet during interruptions. Several assumptions and methods for predicting permanent hearing damage were discussed. Evidence from several animal studies and certain field studies suggested the 3 decibel (dB) exchange rate, but to allow an adjustment to the maximum permissible exposure limit for outdoor, intermittent noise exposures. This was in contrast to a 5 dB exchange rate, for which there appeared to be little scientific support. The amount of such an adjustment should ideally be determined by the temporal pattern of the noise and the levels of quiet between noise bursts. The author suggests that until further information becomes available, the adoption of a conservative approach would be to allow a small increase, such as 2 dB to the permissible exposure limit for outdoor occupations.

40|$|International audienceElevated ambient {{temperatures}} affect {{animal production}} and welfare. Animal's reduced production performances during heat stress were traditionally thought {{to result from}} the decreased feed intake. However, it has recently been shown that heat stress disturbs the steady state concentrations of free radicals, resulting in both cellular and mitochondrial oxidative damage. Indeed, heat stress reorganizes {{the use of the}} body resources including fat, protein and energy. Heat stress reduces the metabolic rates and alters post-absorptive metabolism, regardless of the decreased feed intake. Consequently, growth, production, reproduction and health are not priorities any more in the metabolism of heat-stressed animals. The drastic effects of heat stress depend on its <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> severity.

We searched for studies in the electronic databases Medline. Keywords combined in the search were: “beta-adrenergic blocking agents ” and “electroconvulsive therapy”. The only limitation specified in the search was that the publications should include only randomized controlled trials. Esmolol and other beta-blocking adrenergic agents can {{have a significant effect on}} seizure duration during ECT, it shortens seizure <b>duration,</b> <b>and</b> this effect is probably dose dependent. Therefore routine administration is not recom-mended. Since the relation between seizure <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> efficacy of ECT is dependent on electrode placement it seems advisable to use bilateral electrode placement with patients with cardiovascular risk factors and an indication for use of esmolol dur-ing every session before seizure induction. In the absence of cardiovascular risk factors but with prolonging hypertension or tachycardia during ECT sessions, es-molol also is again preferred. Labetalol is an alternative although, especially in high dose, the longer half-life can be con-sidered as a disadvantage. Experiences with landiolol are limited...|$|R

40|$|Proinflammatory cytokines {{have been}} implicated in the {{pathophysiology}} of both type 1 diabetes (T 1 D) and type 2 diabetes (T 2 D). T 1 D is an autoimmune disease involving the adaptive immune system responding to pancreatic beta-cells as antigen-presenting cells. This attracts immune cells that surround pancreatic islets (insulitis) and secrete cytokines, such as IL- 1 beta, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha, {{in close proximity to}} pancreatic beta-cells. In contrast, there is little evidence for such a focused autoimmune response in T 2 D. Instead, the innate immune system, which responds to cellular damage and pathogens, appears to play a key role. There are three major sources of proinflammatory cytokines that may impact islet/beta-cell function in T 2 D: (1) from islet cells, (2) from increased numbers of intraislet macrophages/immune cells, and (3) from increased circulating levels of proinflammatory cytokines due to obesity, presumably coming from inflamed adipose tissue. These differences between T 1 D and T 2 D are reflected by significant differences in the cytokine concentration, <b>duration,</b> <b>and</b> milieu. This <b>review</b> focuses on chronic versus acute cytokine action, cytokine concentrations, and cytokine milieu {{from the perspective of the}} pancreatic islet in T 2 D. We conclude that new cytokine models may be needed to reflect the pathophysiology of T 2 D more effectively than what are currently employed...|$|R

40|$|Background: Dementia {{affects a}} large and growing number of older adults in the United States. The {{monetary}} costs attributable to dementia {{are likely to be}} similarly large and to continue to increase. Methods: In a subsample (856 persons) of the population in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a nationally representative longitudinal study of older adults, the diagnosis of dementia was determined {{with the use of a}} detailed in-home cognitive assessment that was 3 to 4 hours in <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> a <b>review</b> by an expert panel. We then imputed cognitive status to the full HRS sample (10, 903 persons, 31, 936 personyears) on the basis of measures of cognitive and functional status available for all HRS respondents, thereby identifying persons in the larger sample with a high probability of dementia. The market costs associated with care for persons with dementia were determined on the basis of self-reported out-of-pocket spending and the utilization of nursing home care; Medicare claims data were used to identify costs paid by Medicare. Hours of informal (unpaid) care were valued either as the cost of equivalent formal (paid) care or as the estimated wages forgone by informal caregivers. Results: The estimated prevalence of dementia among persons older than 70 years of age in the United States in 2010 was 14. 7 %. The yearly monetary cost per person that was attributable to dementia was either $ 56, 290 (95 % confidence interval [CI], $ 42, 746 to $ 69, 834) or $ 41, 689 (95 % CI, $ 31, 017 to $ 52, 362), depending on the method used to value informal care. These individual costs suggest that the total monetary cost of dementia in 2010 was between $ 157 billion and $ 215 billion. Medicare paid approximately $ 11 billion of this cost. Conclusions: Dementia represents a substantial financial burden on society, one that is similar to the financial burden of heart disease and cancer. (Funded by the National Institute on Aging.).

40|$|Hypoxic {{pulmonary}} vasoconstriction (HPV) {{serves to}} optimize ventilation-perfusion matching in focal hypoxia and thereby enhances pulmonary gas exchange. During global hypoxia, however, HPV induces general pulmonary vasoconstriction, which {{may lead to}} pulmonary hypertension (PH), impaired exercise capacity, right-heart failure and pulmonary oedema at high altitude. In chronic hypoxia, generalized HPV together with hypoxic pulmonary arterial remodelling, {{contribute to the development}} of PH. The present article reviews the principal pathways in the in vivo modulation of HPV, hypoxic pulmonary arterial remodelling and PH with primary focus on the endothelin- 1, nitric oxide, cyclooxygenase and adenine nucleotide pathways. In summary, endothelin- 1 and thromboxane A 2 may enhance, whereas nitric oxide and prostacyclin may moderate, HPV as well as hypoxic pulmonary arterial remodelling and PH. The production of prostacyclin seems to be coupled primarily to cyclooxygenase- 1 in acute hypoxia, but to cyclooxygenase- 2 in chronic hypoxia. The potential role of adenine nucleotides in modulating HPV is unclear, but warrants further study. Additional modulators of the pulmonary vascular responses to hypoxia may include angiotensin II, histamine, serotonin/ 5 -hydroxytryptamine, leukotrienes and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids. Drugs targeting these pathways may reduce acute and/or chronic hypoxic PH. Endothelin receptor antagonists and phosphodiesterase- 5 inhibitors may additionally improve exercise capacity in hypoxia. Importantly, the modulation of the pulmonary vascular responses to hypoxia varies between species and individuals, with hypoxic <b>duration</b> <b>and</b> age. The <b>review</b> also define how drugs targeting the endothelin- 1, nitric oxide, cyclooxygenase and adenine nucleotide pathways may improve pulmonary haemodynamics, but also impair pulmonary gas exchange by interference with HPV in chronic lung diseases...|$|R
