40|$|Beginning in the 1990 s, firms often {{continue}} {{to trade on}} the major national exchanges after Chapter 11 <b>bankruptcy</b> filings. <b>For</b> <b>bankruptcies</b> filed from 1993 - 2003, {{we find that the}} more negative the filing period price reaction, the more favorable the immediate post- filing returns, on average. This reversal is not attributable to bid-ask bounce, it holds after controlling for other factors associated with post-filing returns, and it appears more attributable to the activities of large traders than to small traders. Supplementary tests reveal that the pattern of post-filing returns differs significantly <b>for</b> <b>bankruptcies</b> filed in bull versus bear markets. Bankruptcies filed during the 1993 to 1999 bull market enjoy substantial but short-lived reversals averaging one-third of the filing period price plunge. These reversals are inconsistent with efficient assimilation of the bankruptcy information. In contrast, we find no evidence of post-filing reversals <b>for</b> <b>bankruptcies</b> filed from 2000 to 2003...|$|R
