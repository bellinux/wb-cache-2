5|$|An <b>elaborated</b> APXS {{setup is}} {{equipped}} with a sensor head containing six curium sources having the total radioactive decay rate of several tens of millicuries (roughly a gigabecquerel).

40|$|The {{coevolution}} of extravagant male {{traits and}} female mate preferences {{is a central}} tenet of sexual selection theory. In lineages in which males have developed more <b>elaborate</b> sexual characters, females R, ehfavour the most extreme expression of the trait. In some taxa, however, ornamental displays have evolved from more to less exaggerated states. Under these circumstances, {{it is unclear whether}} females show preferences for an ancestral male condition or for the current, less <b>elaborate</b> display. Here, we tested female mate preferences relative to male ornamental coloration in two species of cardueline finch (the American goldfinch, Carduelis tristis, and pine siskin, Carduelis pinus) that have evolved less <b>elaborate</b> carotenoid-based colour displays frommore elaborately coloured ancestral states. We presented females of each species with a choice of males having either large patches of red colour (the <b>elaborate,</b> ancestral condition) or with species-typical patches of yellow colour (the less <b>elaborate,</b> derived state). Female goldfinches and siskins showed consistent preferences for the natural colour displays of males, and not for the more <b>elaborate,</b> ancestral colour pattern.

50|$|Because the salle de la Comédie was {{designed}} for stage plays, Versailles lacked a theatre in which more <b>elaborate</b> productions could be staged.
