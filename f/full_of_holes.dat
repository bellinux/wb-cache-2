5|$|The {{cervical}} vertebrae of Apatosaurus {{are less}} elongated and more heavily constructed {{than those of}} Diplodocus, a diplodocid like Apatosaurus, and {{the bones of the}} leg are much stockier despite being longer, implying that Apatosaurus was a more robust animal. The tail was held above the ground during normal locomotion. Apatosaurus had a single claw on each forelimb and three on each hindlimb. The Apatosaurus skull, long thought to be similar to Camarasaurus, is much more similar to that of Diplodocus. Apatosaurus was a generalized browser that likely held its head elevated. To lighten its vertebrae, Apatosaurus had air sacs that made the bones internally <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes.</b> Like that of other diplodocids, its tail may have been used as a whip to create loud noises.|$|E

500|$|Butcher {{was able}} to save some of his teacher's salary, and to borrow enough more to open the first {{photography}} studio in Custer County. [...] The studio was housed in a lath-and-adobe building, measuring , with a dirt floor and with cotton sheeting in lieu of glass to cover the windows and the skylights. [...] As a backdrop for the photos, he used an old cloth wagon cover. [...] The cloth had been gnawed by rats and was <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes,</b> which Lillie patched. [...] To keep the patches from showing up in photographs, Butcher attached two coil springs from an old bed to the ceiling, then hung the backdrop from them. [...] Before taking a picture, he plucked the backdrop so that it oscillated on the springs; the motion, combined with the long exposure time required, blurred the backdrop so that the patches would not be visible in the photograph.|$|E
500|$|After the film's initial release, {{critical}} reception {{continues to}} be positive. Film scholar Andy Klein wrote that the film is [...] "almost a distillation of [...] post-1986 work. Even if the plot is <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes,</b> and the emotional tug isn't quite as strong as in The Killer, the action sequences (nearly the whole movie) are among the greatest ever filmed". Mark Salisbury of Empire Magazine gave the film four stars out of five, calling it [...] "Infinitely more exciting than a dozen Die Hards, action cinema doesn't come any better than this." [...] Salisbury compared Hard Boiled to Woo's American films, stating that his Hong Kong films are [...] "not as slick as his later films, [...] more inventive and stylised and [...] great early performances from Fat and Leung". Empire placed the film at number 70 in their list of [...] "The 100 Best Films Of World Cinema" [...] in 2010. Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine gave the film the highest rating of four stars, proclaiming it {{to be one of}} Woo's best films. The British film magazine Empire ranked the character of Tequila as 33rd in their [...] "The 100 Greatest Movie Characters" [...] poll.|$|E

500|$|When Elizabeth I became queen, {{she ordered}} {{a survey of}} her castles. A 1562 report told her that only ten castles {{in the north of}} her realm were worth keeping; Melbourne was not one of these. A further survey in 1576 {{reported}} that, although the stonework was in good condition apart from one chimney and window, the timbers were perished, the lead roof was <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes,</b> one kitchen {{was on the verge of}} collapse, and another needed its floor replacing. In the same year, George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury, wrote to the queen to assure her that the castle was in good condition, worth £1,000, and could be repaired for £100. Since he was responsible for keeping the imprisoned Mary, Queen of Scots, and her 140 retainers, he hoped to get her moved to Melbourne. In 1583, the castle was inspected again to see if it was suitable to house the captive queen. Although the rooms were sufficient in number and quality, the unfinished building was deemed [...] "imperfect at every corner". The large rooms would need subdividing, the floors were earth and plaster, and there was no paved courtyard [...] "so as being out of dors you are in the myre, for it is verie foule and unpleasaunt to walk round about the said house". In 1584, Queen Elizabeth finally decided to move Mary to Melbourne, only for the plan to be abandoned following the Babington Plot to assassinate the English queen and place her Scottish cousin on the throne.|$|E
2500|$|An {{important}} factor in the reception of Swift's work is that the narrator of the work is an extremist in every direction. Consequently, he can no more construct a sound allegory than he can finish his digressions without losing control (eventually confessing that he is insane). For a Church of England reader, the allegory of the brothers provides small comfort. Martin has a corrupted faith, one <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes</b> and still with ornaments on it. His only virtue is that he avoids the excesses of his brothers, but the original faith is lost to him. Readers of the Tale have picked up on this unsatisfactory resolution to both [...] "parts" [...] of the book, and A Tale of a Tub has often been offered up as evidence of Swift's misanthropy.|$|E

[...] shouting at me, kicking me and wrenching my arm."Prosecutors put aside the pajamas and instead presented five pieces of bloody clothing that were found in a tank at the miso factory in August 1967, 14 months after the crime. They argued that the clothing came from the killer and said police had found the blood types of the victims on the clothing.

2500|$|Epicharmus of Kos or Epicharmus Comicus or Epicharmus Comicus Syracusanus (...) , {{thought to}} have lived between c. 540 and c. 450 BC, was a Greek dramatist and philosopher often {{credited}} with {{being one of the}} first comic writers, having originated the Doric or Sicilian comedic form. Aristotle (Poetics 5.1449b5) writes that he and Phormis invented comic plots (μῦθοι, muthoi). Most of the information we have about Epicharmus comes from the writings of Athenaeus, Suda and Diogenes Laertius, but fragments and comments come up in a host of other ancient authors as well. [...] There have also been some papyrus finds of longer sections of text, but these are often so <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes</b> {{that it is difficult to}} make sense of them.

2500|$|By {{the time}} the Japanese {{occupied}} Nauru {{in the summer of}} 1942, their rampage in the Pacific was coming to an end; checked at the Battle of the Coral Sea and defeated at Milne Bay and Midway, the Japanese were being forced onto the defensive. In 1943, as American offensives loomed in the relatively close Gilbert and Marshall Islands, the garrison on Nauru continued to improve its defences, unaware that the American Joint Chiefs of Staff, at a meeting in August, had decided to bypass the island. Wrote historian Samuel Eliot Morison, [...] "it seemed unwise to leave an island with an airfield only 380 miles from Tarawa in enemy hands. But, the more Nauru was studied, the less anyone liked the idea of assaulting it. For Nauru is a solid island with no harbour or lagoon, shaped like a hat with a narrow brim of coastal plain where the enemy had built his airfield, and a crown where he had mounted coast defence artillery. The hilly interior was <b>full</b> <b>of</b> <b>holes</b> and caves where phosphate rock had been excavated - just the sort of terrain that the Japanese liked for defensive operations." ...|$|E

[...] They had until April 5 of that year to hand in their retirement papers, or face the even more harsh punishment of outright dismissal. Two year bans are given to those who admitted wrongdoing: Chiyohakuho, Takenawa Oyakata (ex Kasuganishiki) and sandanme ranked Enatsukasa (who acted as the go-between). However, all three have indicated they are leaving sumo completely. [...] Enatsukasa issued an apology to sumo fans, saying [...] "I've {{caused a lot of}} problems for the wrestlers who genuinely put in the work, and it hurts." [...] Seventeen sumo elders are demoted, with executive members Kitanoumi, Kokonoe and Michinoku resigning from their posts and chairman Hanaregoma taking a 30 per cent pay cut for two months. Hanaregoma told a press conference, [...] "We had to punish many people, all of whom are our colleagues. It was a very tough decision to make." [...] About ten other wrestlers are still under investigation, meaning {{it is unlikely that the}} Natsu tournament in May will go ahead.|$|E
