5|$|As Madge and {{her family}} turns to {{celebrate}} Christmas, the Doctor attempts to slip away, but Madge catches him, and as she sees the TARDIS realises {{that he is the}} man in the space suit from three years before. She insists on his staying for Christmas dinner, but the Doctor reveals he has other friends who believe he is dead. Madge convinces him to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them. The Doctor offers Madge his help if she ever needs it again. Later, the Doctor arrives outside the home of Amy (Karen Gillan) and Rory (Arthur Darvill), two years since he left them there ("The God Complex"). They invite him to have Christmas dinner, as they had always set him a place at the dinner table. Unseen by them, the Doctor wipes away a tear of joy.|$|E
5|$|The next day, on Christmas, Aya and her partner, Daniel, <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a {{scientist}} at the Museum of Natural History named Dr. Klamp. He teaches the protagonists about mitochondria, {{but they do not}} find his information useful since it does not explain the previous night's events. Later that day, they hear that Eve is in Central Park, and to make matters worse, an audience has gathered at the park's theater intending to see a performance that Melissa Pearce was to give. Aya enters Central Park alone as Daniel is unable to pass through the entrance without spontaneously combusting. She makes it to the theater, but is too late to stop Eve, who causes the theater audience's mitochondria to rebel against their hosts and turns the crowd into a slimy orange mass. Aya chases after Eve and is knocked unconscious after a fight with her aboard a horse-drawn carriage. Daniel discovers that his son, Ben, was at the park, but had left the audience at the Central Park theater when he began to feel ill and when his mother began to act strange. He also learns that Manhattan is being evacuated due to the threat that Eve poses.|$|E
5|$|While Manhattan {{is being}} evacuated, a Japanese man named Kunihiko Maeda manages {{to sneak into}} the city, {{witnessing}} a police officer combust into flames in the process. Aya awakens in an apartment in SoHo, with Daniel and Maeda at her side. Maeda reveals the origins of Eve: A scientist tried to culture the cells of his wife after {{she was involved in}} a car accident, and the mitochondria in her cells took over her body. Maeda believes that Eve may be trying to give birth to an “Ultimate Being”. The next day, the three <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Dr. Klamp again. After examining cell samples from that of Eve and Aya's, Maeda concludes that based on selfish gene theory, Aya and Eve's mitochondria are in an evolutionary race for survival. Dr. Klamp suddenly appears and asks a few questions of Aya in a hostile manner. The three leave and head for the St. Francis Hospital, where Maeda thinks Eve may try to get sperm for the Ultimate Being. When they arrive, they find that Eve is already there. Eve takes the sperm and escapes.|$|E

25|$|I {{believe that}} it is one of my strong collaborations. It already has me worried about the future. This is my best moment now, as far as the match I have musically with Sakis. Without wanting to put down all the people I have collaborated with I adore them like, ex, Giorgos Mazonakis. The people who <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Sakis musically are very close to me, in {{relation}} to those who <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a laïko artist. The track was recorded sometime in late November at Kontopoulos' studio, coinciding with the artists' busy rehearsal schedule for The S Club. Before its release, Tamta had not heard the final result as Kontopoulos and Rouvas were in the studio up until the song's release working on the finishing touches.|$|E
25|$|The band {{is not in}} {{competition}} with other Christian bands. We feel we are competing with Journey, Styx and REO Speedwagon.

We need to have a light system, sound system and presentation that will be competitive with those groups.|$|E
25|$|While in New York, Menken met {{the poet}} Walt Whitman {{and some others}} of his bohemian circle. She was {{influenced}} by his work and began to write in a more confessional style while adhering to common sentimental conventions of the time. In 1860-61, she published 25 poems in the Sunday Mercury, an entertainment newspaper in New York. These were later collected with six more in her only book, Infelicia, published {{a few months after}} her death. By publishing in a newspaper, she reached a larger audience than through women's magazines, including both men and women readers who might <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her perform as an actress.|$|E

25|$|From 1901 to 1937, Taiwanese cinema was {{influenced}} immensely by Japanese cinema. Because of Taiwan's {{status as a}} Japanese colony, the traditions of Japanese movies were generally accepted by Taiwanese producers. For instance, {{the use of a}} benshi (narrator of silent films), which was a very important component of the film-going experience in Japan, was adopted and renamed piansu by the Taiwanese. This narrator was very different from its equivalent in the Western world. It rapidly evolved into a star system. In fact, people would <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the very same film narrated by different benshi, to hear the other benshi's interpretation. A romance could become a comedy or a drama, depending on the narrator's style and skills.|$|E
25|$|In {{the season}} finale, Duncan's old friend, Hugh Fitzcairn, comes to see him, with news that Immortals are disappearing. When they <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Darius, they find him decapitated inside the church. Returning to Fitz's hotel, they are {{attacked}} and Fitz is spirited away, whilst Duncan {{returns to the}} church, finding a book hidden by Darius. It {{is a history of}} Immortals written by a secret society of mortals. When these mortals come for Duncan, he is ready and follows them back to their hideout, rescuing Fitz, who is about to be guillotined and confronting their leader, a wild-eyed fanatic who wants to destroy all Immortals. He gets away, leaving a shattered MacLeod to mourn his friend and teacher. The series ends with MacLeod vowing revenge on the men and pouring Darius' ashes into the Seine, to flow out to the sea.|$|E
25|$|In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (1999), Ron's rat, Scabbers, {{already seen}} in Philosopher's Stone, goes missing, which he blames Hermione's new cat Crookshanks, {{and the two}} have a falling-out. They {{eventually}} make up when Hermione has a nervous breakdown brought by taking too many classes and distress at {{the fate of the}} hippogriff Buckbeak. The animal, owned by Hagrid, has been put on trial for injuring Draco and risks execution. Ron offers to help with the preparation of Buckbeak's defence, but this fails to help. Harry, Ron and Hermione <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Hagrid on the execution day where they discover Scabbers hiding out in Hagrid's hut. As they leave, Scabbers struggles free of Ron and runs away. He chases Scabbers to the Whomping Willow where he is grabbed by a large black dog and dragged into a tunnel hidden below the tree.|$|E

25|$|Welsh bands {{have the}} outlet for audiences, on such media as BBC Wales, BBC Cymru, S4C and The Pop Factory. In particular, BBC Radio 1's Bethan and Huw and BBC Radio Wales's Adam Walton support new Welsh music at their {{respective}} stations. Every year, Mentrau Iaith Cymru, The National Eisteddfod and BBC Radio Cymru have their national 'Battle of the Bands,' where young, upcoming Welsh bands can compete for £1000, and, what {{is thought to}} be one of the greatest possible achievements for a Welsh language act, to perform at Maes B, on its final night. In addition to Maes B, there are a number of various Welsh language music events throughout the year that have gained popularity in the past few years. In February each year the Welsh magazine 'Y Selar' hosts an award ceremony in Aberystwyth University where Welsh music fans from all over the country <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the most popular and upcoming bands perform. There's also the 'Dawns Rhyngolegol' where the Welsh societies from every University in the UK gather to celebrate the best Welsh language music in Wales.|$|E

500|$|Given the lax {{copyright}} {{laws of the}} time, stage plays based on Uncle Tom's Cabin—"Tom shows"—began to appear while the novel was still being serialized. Stowe refused to authorize dramatization of her work because of her distrust of drama (although she did eventually <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> George L. Aiken's version and, according to Francis Underwood, was [...] "delighted" [...] by Caroline Howard's portrayal of Topsy). Aiken's stage production continued as [...] "the most popular play in England and America for seventy-five years." [...] Stowe's refusal to authorize a particular dramatic version left the field clear {{for any number of}} adaptations, some launched for (various) political reasons and others as simply commercial theatrical ventures.|$|E
500|$|The {{criminal}} {{case against the}} Black Sox defendants suffered unexpected setbacks, with evidence vanishing, {{including some of the}} incriminating statements made to the grand jury. The prosecution was forced to dismiss the original indictments, and bring new charges against seven of the ballplayers (McMullin was not charged again). Frustrated by the delays, Landis placed all eight on an [...] "ineligible list", banning them from major and minor league baseball. Comiskey supported Landis by giving the seven who remained under contract to the White Sox their unconditional release. Public sentiment was heavily against the ballplayers, and when Jackson, Williams, Felsch, and Weaver played in a semi-pro game, The Sporting News mocked the 3,000 attendees, [...] "Just Like Nuts <b>Go</b> <b>to</b> <b>See</b> a Murderer".|$|E

Ugolin Soubeyran (Auteuil) returns {{early in the morning}} from his {{military}} service and wakes up his uncle César (Montand), called in the local dialect [...] 'Le Papet' meaning grandfather. Ugolin stays only briefly to talk, as he is eager to get to his own place farther up in the mountains. Here he throws himself into a project that—at first—he keeps secret from Papet. He eventually reveals that the project consists of growing carnations. Papet is at first skeptical, but he is convinced when the flowers get a good price at the local market. They decide the project is worthy of expansion, and together they <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the neighboring farmer known as Pique-Bouffigue, to buy his land.|$|E

Kelly was introduced to Hilary Brown at one of the Dots' gigs and they later married – the relationship is described in [...] "When I First Met Your Ma" [...] (1992). Brown's father supplied Kelly with a gravy recipe – used on [...] "How to Make Gravy" [...] (1996). Their son, Declan, was born in 1980.|$|E
