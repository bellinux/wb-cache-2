The former is the inspiration {{of the project and}} provides a bioclimatic model suited to the Mediterranean latitudes. The latter is prompted by the need to adapt the traditional model to modern demands and technologies. Following tradition, we worked with the Mediterranean climate of the Italian peninsula, where protection from heat gains has the same importance as protection from cold and, in many cases, is even more relevant.

40|$|Facilities {{operating}} in cycles, such as particles accelerators, require pulsed power. Directly drawing this pulsed {{power from the}} industrial network is generally not acceptable. A system with a local energy storage system lessens {{the impact on the}} network. In this work, a power supply is proposed that allows pulsed operation of a proton synchrotron without disturbing the industrial network with large variations of active power. The context of this study is the search of a completely static replace ment of an existing <b>inertial</b> energy <b>storage</b> device. The application is the proton synchrotron of the CERN. Several solutions to store the energy needed by the proton synchrotron are studied, they include <b>inertial</b> energy <b>storage,</b> capacitive energy storage and magnetic energy storage. On this basis, the solution based on capacitive energy storage with interleaved multilevel converters is retained. The sizing of the storage elements and the filter is carried out. The control strategies are studied and designed. They are composed of a current balancing control for the parallel connected converters and a voltage balance techniques for the DC buses of the series connected converters. Based on the pseudo-continuous modeling and controller sizing techniques, an advanced model for interleaved multilevel converters is established. It allows to have a better definition of the step response of the system. It is possible to use a PID controller instead of a PI controller to obtain of better step response. Numerical simulations are carried out to verify the control strategies of the system.

40|$|An <b>inertial</b> energy <b>storage</b> {{device is}} {{disclosed}} which uses flywheel made of flexible material {{such as a}} twisted rope ring. A small number of the strands of the rope ring have a tensile strength that is {{lower than that of}} most of the other strands so that should any of these strands fail, they will begin to whiplash allowing such a failure to be detected and braked before a castastrophic failure occurs. This accomplished by the inclusion of glass tubes located around the periphery of the flywheel. The tubes are in communication with a braking fluid reservoir. The flywheel and glass tubes are enclosed within a vacuum-tight housing. The whiplashing of a broken strand breaks one or more glass tubes. This causes the housing to be flooded with the braking fluid thereby braking the rotation of the flywheel...|$|R

The baseline power system configuration selected is a series system employing peak-power-tracking for a Low Earth-Orbiting application. Power processing, required in the motor/generator, provides potential alternative that can only be achieved in systems with electrochemical energy storage by the addition of power processing components. One such alternative configuration provides for peak-power-tracking of the solar array and still maintains a regulated bus, without the expense of additional power processing components. Precise speed control of the two counterrotating wheels is required to reduce interaction with the attitude control system (ACS) or alternatively, used to perform attitude control functions...|$|R
40|$|A {{new system}} is being {{developed}} that performs satellite attitude control, attitude reference, and energy storage utilizing inertia wheels. The baseline approach consists of two counter rotating flywheels suspended in specially designed magnetic bearings, spin axis motor/generators, and a control system. The control system regulates the magnetic bearings and spin axis motor/generators and interacts with other satellite subsystems (photovoltaic array, star trackers, Sun sensors, magnetic torquers, etc.) to perform the three functions. Existing satellites utilize separate subsystems to perform attitude control, provide attitude reference, and store energy. These functions are currently performed using reaction or momentum wheels, gyros, batteries, and devices that provide an absolute reference (Sun sensors and star trackers). A Combined Attitude, Reference, and Energy Storage (CARES) system based on high energy density <b>inertial</b> energy <b>storage</b> wheels (flywheels) has potential advantages over existing technologies. Even when used only for energy storage, this system offers the potential for substantial improvements in life, energy efficiency, and weight over existing battery technologies.

Magnetic energy is stored in the motor's rotor windings and possibly in the field windings. Current flowing in these windings will create a magnetic field to store energy proportional to the current and number of turns in the coils and will also provide the impetus, in conjunction with pulses in the field coils, to spin the flywheel / rotor.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the energy sector has looked to {{renewables}} {{as a means to}} reduce emissions. Wind power is able to provide large amounts of energy at a reasonable cost from presently available products. Thus the amount of wind generation has risen steeply in recent years, notably in the countries of northern Europe. However, this rise in wind power has lead to issues regarding the variability of the wind power output. Wind power is related to the wind speed, which varies greatly. This variability can cause issues with wind operators' ability to participate in electricity markets and can also lead to a rise in balancing costs. The system proposed in this thesis aims to reduce the variation of wind farm output seen in the minute to minute time-scale and provide controllability in longer time-scales. To do this the system uses short-term wind speed predictions and the <b>inertial</b> energy <b>storage</b> of the wind turbines themselves and does so in a co-ordinated fashion across the whole farm. Using short term wind speed predictions, the amount of energy in the wind is calculated for the next short period. This energy can be exported in a controlled manner using the inertial energy to cover short-term wind energy shortfall or excess. The rotor speed must vary for the storage effect to be achieved and this requires extra control systems to prevent over-speed or turbine stalling. The system was tested and found to be effective at smoothing the output power in a range of different wind scenarios. Tests were performed to assess the effects of using co-ordinated control on the frequency of an example grid and on the use patterns of portfolio generators. Both tests show that the use of a co-ordination controller at wind farm level reduces the balancing burden on the remainder of the system in comparison with the common maximum power form of control.

40|$|The {{adaptive}} plasticity of {{the spatial}} {{organization of the}} vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) has been investigated in intact and canal-plugged primates using 2 -h exposure to conflicting visual (optokinetic, OKN) and vestibular rotational stimuli about mutually orthogonal axes (generating torsional VOR + vertical OKN, torsional VOR + horizontal OKN, vertical VOR + horizontal OKN, and horizontal VOR + vertical OKN). Adaptation protocols with 0. 5 -Hz (+/- 18 degrees) head movements about either an earth-vertical or an earth-horizontal axis induced orthogonal response components as high as 40 - 70 % of those required for ideal adaptation. Orthogonal response gains were highest at the adapting frequency with phase leads present at lower and phase lags present at higher frequencies. Furthermore, {{the time course of}} adaptation, as well as orthogonal response dynamics were similar and relatively independent of the particular visual/vestibular stimulus combination. Low-frequency (0. 05 Hz, vestibular stimulus: +/- 60 degrees; optokinetic stimulus: +/- 180 degrees) adaptation protocols with head movements about an earth-vertical axis induced smaller orthogonal response components that did not exceed 20 - 40 % of the head velocity stimulus (i. e., approximately 10 % of that required for ideal adaptation). At the same frequency, adaptation with head movements about an earth-horizontal axis generated large orthogonal responses that reached values as high as 100 - 120 % of head velocity after 2 h of adaptation (i. e., approximately 40 % of ideal adaptation gains). The particular spatial and temporal response characteristics after low-frequency, earth-horizontal axis adaptation in both intact and canal-plugged animals strongly suggests that the orienting (and perhaps translational) but not <b>inertial</b> (velocity <b>storage)</b> components of the primate otolith-ocular system exhibit spatial adaptability. Due to the particular nested arrangement of the visual and vestibular stimuli, the optic flow pattern exhibited a significant component about the third spatial axis (i. e., orthogonal to the axes of rotation of the head and visual surround) at twice the oscillation frequency. Accordingly, the adapted VOR was characterized consistently by a third response component (orthogonal to both the axes of head and optokinetic drum rotation) at twice the oscillation frequency after earth-horizontal but not after earth-vertical axis 0. 05 -Hz adaptation. This suggests that the otolith-ocular (but not the semicircular canal-ocular) system can adaptively change its spatial organization at frequencies {{different from those of the}} head movement...|$|R
40|$| assembly. In this chapter, two novel {{methods for}} {{electrode}} coating are proposed: the Inertial Impaction and the Electro-spray processes. They both rely on aerosol technology and they constitute elegant approaches for printing/coating processes. The resulting structures are characterized {{in terms of}} morphology, highlighting promising features for different kinds of applications, ranging from sensors to electrochemical energy <b>storage.</b> <b>Inertial</b> impaction is used in combination with spark discharge generated particles. Particles are accelerated in the ultra-sonic regime through a static nozzle. The acceleration {{is the result of}} a large pressure drop set by means of a critical orifice. Inertia is responsible for subsequent collisional events between particle-substrate and particle-particle, which lead to the formation of a highly porous structure. For the experimental parameters used in this study, the typical morphology of the produced layers exhibits a volcano-like shape where a central, compact crater is surrounded by a so-called rim. This area is shown to be highly porous with an internal structure constituted by vertically oriented fibrous agglomerates. Unfortunately, preliminary results on the electronic conductivity of the layers where not reproducible. This fact is attributed to the high sensitivity of the spark discharge generated particles towards oxygen and to the eventual leaks in the setup used for the electrical measurements. Nevertheless, this approach is still suitable to be applied in several areas of interests. Sensor devices could be fabricated, provided that the surface of the silicon particles is passivated with a stable functionalization that could interact with chemical species in a specific and reversible manner. Moreover, by reducing the impaction time and thereby the thickness of the electrodes, it can be envisioned that the resulting thin layers could be implemented for the fabrication of solid-state micro batteries. In this way, the intrinsic shortcoming of having a low particle production rate would be balanced by the limited amount of material needed for the specific application, and the absence of any liquid contaminant could enable for a high purity of the active material involved in the process. Alternatively, Electro-spray is presented as a novel method to standard coating techniques (e. g. doctor blading). It is used to perform direct de- position of mixtures of active/inactive material, dispersed on nano-metric scales. As-produced layers show a constant thickness throughout all the sprayed surfaces, a very good adhesion with the current collector and a high surface area. The thickness of the layer can be controlled according to the deposition time and varies typically between 10 and 20 ?m. High surface to volume ratio is the result of the layer nano-structure, which is achieved by a stable multi-cone jet deposition. Solid aggregates are formed by constitutive spherical units, which size lies in the hundred of nanometer range for the Si-CMC sample. The deposition process takes place at low temperatures, in ambient conditions and, upon the right choice of the polymeric binder, with the use of non-toxic chemicals or solvents. In addition to that, the concrete possibility of upscaling the process with multi-nozzle system and roll-to-roll substrates makes this technique appealing from an industrial point of view, where large scale application demand could be taken into consideration. In this respect, the fabricated Si based nano-composite electrodes, are considered as a promising solution to increase the energy density of lithium ion batteries and they could open new possibilities for the sustainable mobility concept. Chapter 6 describes the electrochemical behavior of the silicon nano- composite electrodes in a half cell configuration (i. e. Si vs. Li). The first part of the chapter is dedicated to the explanation of the failure mechanisms of the silicon-based electrodes, while the second part offers viable solution to the capacity fading issue and the short lifetime of such electrodes. In this respect, a major role is played by the choice of an appropriate polymeric binder, which can accommodate the large volume expansion occurring dur- ing the electrochemical alloying of lithium. The capacity fading mechanism is further investigated and a simple mechanical model is suggested, which is supported by one of the two CMC binding mechanisms already proposed in the literature. Hydrogen-bond formation between the CMC and the surface of the nano-particles and the dynamic nature of this weak interaction are responsible for the self-healing process that occurs at the sub-micron scale, where the electrical contact does not appear to be lost. As no specific interaction between PVdF and the surface of the Si nano-particle is expected, the capacity of such nano- composite electrodes tends to fade much more rapidly. Furthermore, im- proving the electrodes characteristics in terms of composition and layer thickness resulted in interesting performances at C/ 20, as well as good rate capabilities. Despite the reduced capacity at much higher C-rates, the sys- tem recovers its capacity almost completely when coming back to C/ 20, hence, indicating that the capacity loss is not due to parasitic reactions. In particular, a preliminary surface treatment significantly reduced the initial irreversible capacity loss and increased the lifetime and the cycleability of the electrodes. Overall, only small morphological changes upon cycling with no electrode fracturing have been observed, thus indicating the validity of the approach here reported for the preparation of an innovative anode material for advanced lithium ion batteries. Concluding with an important remark, it is wort noting that the main goal of this thesis, the synthesis and application of a silicon-based nano-structure in an energy storage device, has been successfully achieved.
