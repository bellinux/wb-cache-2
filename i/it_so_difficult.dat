5|$|Born in Toronto {{with the}} surname Nudelman, Newman {{was the son}} of a Russian-Jewish {{immigrant}} father who ran a shoe shop. After studying at Ogden Public School, which he left at the age of thirteen, he later enrolled in the Central Technical School, studying art and design subjects. He initially attempted to follow a career as a stills photographer and an artist, specialising in drawing film posters. However, he found <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> to earn enough money to make a living from this profession that instead, he switched to working in the film industry itself. In 1938, he travelled to Hollywood, where he was offered a role with the Walt Disney Company on the strength of his graphic design work. However, he was unable to take the job due to a failure to secure a work permit. Returning to his native country, in 1941, he gained a job as a film editor at the National Film Board of Canada. He was eventually to work on over 350 films while an editor for the NFB.|$|E

25|$|After {{invention}} of the cotton gin made profitable the processing of short-staple cotton, {{there was a major}} push by whites to develop lands in the Deep South for such cultivation. This greatly increased the demand for slave labor, especially after the US ended the legal Atlantic slave trade in 1808. The rate of manumission fell sharply in southern states. Through the domestic slave trade, some one million slaves were transported from the Upper South to the Deep South in the following years. Most southern states tightened restrictions on manumission, effectively ending it. They enacted laws requiring legislative approval for each act of manumission, making <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> that few slaveholders pursued this, even for their own mixed-race children. At the same time African Americans attempted to resist racialized definitions of freedom. Petitions for freedom suits were {{one of the most powerful}} strategies to redefine racial categories, claim freedom, and reconstitute families in the face of enslavement.|$|E

500|$|The {{first film}} Shaw {{appeared}} in was Caste in 1930. He {{soon began to}} make a name for himself in films such as Brewster's Millions in 1935, Men Are Not Gods in 1936 and Farewell Again in 1937. He was making about £300 a week during this stage of his career, a significant sum higher than the salary of the British Prime Minister of the time. He brought what the Daily Telegraph described as a [...] "smooth villainy" [...] to the role of Frank Sutton in The Squeaker in 1937, while in 1939 he played the hero Cmdr. David Blacklock alongside Conrad Veidt and Valerie Hobson in The Spy in Black, Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's first collaboration. Shaw described himself as a film buff and called Academy Award-winning actor Spencer Tracy his [...] "great god of all screen actors"; he was so impressed by Tracy's technique that he claimed to become depressed while watching his films because Tracy made acting look simple, while Shaw claimed to find <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> to master himself.|$|E
500|$|In 1917, {{the black}} writer W. E. B. Du Bois {{observed}} {{that the impact of}} [...] "ever-recurring race discrimination" [...] had made <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> to travel to any number of destinations, from popular resorts to major cities, that it was now [...] "a puzzling query as to what to do with vacations". It was a problem that came to affect an increasing number of black people in {{the first decades of the}} 20th century. Tens of thousands of southern African Americans migrated from farms in the south to factories and domestic service in the north. No longer confined to living at a subsistence level, many gained enough disposable income and time to engage in leisure travel. The development of affordable mass-produced automobiles liberated black Americans from having to rely on the [...] "Jim Crow cars" [...] – smoky, battered and uncomfortable railroad carriages which were the separate but decidedly unequal alternatives to more salubrious whites-only carriages. As one black magazine writer commented in 1933, in an automobile [...] "it's mighty good to be the skipper for a change, and pilot our craft whither and where we will. We feel like Vikings. What if our craft is blunt of nose and limited of power and our sea is macademized; it's good for the spirit to just give the old railroad Jim Crow the laugh." ...|$|E

60|$|So saying, Mr. Brough {{folded up}} the cheque, and {{shaking hands with}} Mr. Roundhand very cordially, got into his carriage-and-four (he always drove four horses even in the City, where <b>it's</b> <b>so</b> <b>difficult),</b> which {{was waiting at the}} office-door for him.|$|R
2500|$|He {{explained}} his particular ethos {{and style of}} management of CSIRO in this way: Well, I suppose I always wanted to extrapolate from my own experience, small-scale experience, and some personal opinions. I had a strong desire always to see pure and applied research undertaken {{side by side in}} the same laboratory.... And I was still very much aware that the recognition that many – most, I should say – of the really important and fundamental discoveries in science which subsequently led to a massive technological development have come through curiosity-led research, and often through serendipity, which is terribly important. I think the Birch report was very helpful, and I agreed with his report that the whole core of the policy-making in the science that we were going to carry out was a matter of defining the right proportion of, shall we say, pure research, strategic mission-oriented, and technical research – and getting that proportion right.... I felt that fundamental research in the end was going to reap the real benefits in the long run ... discovering something like electricity ... was absolutely fundamental research and had an enormous impact on the world. On the other hand, there was the awareness that you're in charge of an organisation that's spending a million dollars of taxpayers' money every day, and that's a very sobering thought, so you had to keep the reins on as well. Indeed, there were many frustrations in being CSIRO's Chairman at that time, of which he nominated as the worst [...] "the frustration of finding <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> to bring in new young blood because of the descending budget in real terms." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>It's</b> <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> to {{be serious}} without being absurd. That is the chief power of women, that life and death are merely {{occasions}} {{for a change of}} costume: marriage a creation in white, and the worship of God an opportunity for a Paris bonnet.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, I've done two {{or three}} little daubs," [...] said Mrs. Elliot, {{speaking}} rather louder than usual.

6000|$|Once I {{clutched}} the flying skirts of my enthusiasm with sufficient firmness to remark {{that in my}} own private opinion a good woman was more precious than rubies; adding immediately afterwards--the words escaping me unconsciously before I was aware even of the thought--"pity <b>it's</b> <b>so</b> <b>difficult</b> to tell 'em." ...|$|R
