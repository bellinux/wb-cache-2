Think! <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> them all? Twenty {{thousand}} pounds would see us through it. We should get our own money back--I am sure of it. There's Rendell, Laverick. He'd do anything for you. You're always shooting or playing cricket with him. Have you asked him, Laverick? He'd never miss the money." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I suppose it's no use trying any persuasion," [...] {{said the}} Rector. [...] "There's such an odd mixture of obstinacy and changeableness in Brooke. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> {{him on the}} subject?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For this reason, your Majesty," [...] {{answered}} Mermes. [...] "We {{are sure}} there is a plot to keep you here. This afternoon <b>you</b> could not <b>have</b> gone, <b>had</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried,</b> but to-night, Abi, being a prisoner, his people are dismayed, and having no leader will open the gates. By to-morrow one may be found, {{and they will be}} double-barred and guarded." ...|$|R

"Thou shalt eat before thou goest," [...] said Lord Huntinglen; [...] "and I will <b>have</b> <b>thee</b> <b>try,</b> moreover, {{whether a}} cup of sack cannot bring some colour into these cheeks of thine. It were a shame to my household, thou shouldst glide out into the Strand after such a spectre-fashion as thou now wearest--Look to it, Dalgarno, for the honour of our roof is concerned." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It cannot be; {{it is not}} to be," [...] he said again, as if to {{convince}} himself. [...] "No such thing is to be thought of. Tell me, Sally, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> to keep up the cheerful side of things to her,--have you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Claire arrived, {{fresh and}} serene in white taffeta, and she cried prettily, [...] "I {{ought to have}} known that you'd be prompt even {{if no one else}} in the world is, so glad you came, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> the kidneys, and do have an--oh, I see you have tried the omelets, how goes the work at the university?" ...|$|E

If it's true, what some them Blavetsky fellers claim, you can visit us here in your astral body--git in with 'em the right way. I should like to <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>try</b> it.

6000|$|Mrs. Gallilee still endured it. [...] "The florist's man," [...] she said, [...] "does all that. I {{sometimes}} dissect flowers, but I never trouble {{myself to}} arrange them. What {{would be the}} use of the man if I did?" [...] This view of the question struck Carmina dumb. Mrs. Gallilee went on.

6000|$|If Carol was so indiscreet as to murmur {{that she}} had a small headache, {{instantly}} the two Smails and Kennicott were at it.

6000|$|Have you {{cut down}} any more trees, played any more rubbers, propounded any more teasers {{to the players}} at the game of Yes and No? How is the old horse? How is the gray mare?

Is Mrs. Cerjat as happy and as well as I would have her, and all your house ditto ditto? Does Haldimand play whist with any science yet? Ha, ha, ha! the idea of his saying I hadn't any!

60|$|TU QUOQUE.--Now {{you know}} the trick, suppose you take a canvas and see whether YOU can do it? There are brushes, palettes, and gallipots full of paint and varnish. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried,</b> my dear sir--you who set {{up to be a}} connoisseur? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried?</b> I have--and many a day. And the end of the day's labor? O dismal conclusion! Is this puerile niggling, this feeble scrawl, this {{impotent}} rubbish, all you can produce--you, who but now found Rubens commonplace and vulgar, and were pointing out the tricks of his mystery? Pardon, O great chief, magnificent master and poet! You can DO. We critics, who sneer and are wise, can but pry, and measure, and doubt, and carp. Look at the lion. Did you ever see such a gross, shaggy, mangy, roaring brute? Look at him eating lumps of raw meat--positively bleeding, and raw and tough--till, faugh! it turns one's stomach to see him--O the coarse wretch! Yes, but he is a lion. Rubens has lifted his great hand, and the mark he has made has endured for two centuries, and we still continue wondering at him, and admiring him. What a strength in that arm! What splendor of will hidden behind that tawny beard, and those honest eyes! Sharpen your pen, my good critic, shoot a feather into him; hit him, and make him wince. Yes, you may hit him fair, and make him bleed, too; but, for all that, he is a lion--a mighty, conquering, generous, rampageous Leo Belgicus--monarch of his wood. And he is not dead yet, and I will not kick at him.|$|E
6000|$|Holmes {{smiled and}} shook his head. [...] "It {{seems to me to}} have only one drawback, Hopkins, and that is that it is {{intrinsically}} impossible. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> to drive a harpoon through a body? No? Tut, tut my dear sir, you must really pay attention to these details. My friend Watson could tell you that I spent a whole morning in that exercise. It is no easy matter, and requires a strong and practised arm. But this blow was delivered with such violence that the head of the weapon sank deep into the wall. Do you imagine that this anaemic youth was capable of so frightful an assault? Is he the man who hobnobbed in rum and water with Black Peter in the dead of the night? Was it his profile that was seen on the blind two nights before? No, no, Hopkins, it is another and more formidable person for whom we must seek." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{those two}} hours are beyond measure delightful. Some {{of us were}} querulous up to that time, and doubted of the wisdom of making the voyage. Lisbon, we owned, was a failure; Athens a dead failure; Malta very well, but not worth the trouble and sea-sickness: in fact, Baden-Baden or Devonshire {{would be a better}} move than this; when Smyrna came, and rebuked all mutinous Cockneys into silence. Some men may read this who are in want of a sensation. If they love the odd and picturesque, if they loved the [...] "Arabian Nights" [...] in their youth, let them book {{themselves}} on board one of the Peninsular and Oriental vessels, and try one DIP into Constantinople or Smyrna. Walk into the bazaar, and the East is unveiled to you: how often and often <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> to fancy this, lying out on a summer holiday at school! It is wonderful, too, how LIKE it is: you may imagine that you have been in the place before, you seem to know it so well! ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ay, but I {{paid him}} off {{for it in}} the hall, as you {{yourself}} saw.--I was never in better fence in my life, Joceline. That same steward fellow is not so utterly black-hearted a rogue as the most of them, Joceline. He fences well--excellent well. I will <b>have</b> <b>thee</b> <b>try</b> a bout in the hall with him to-morrow, though I think he will be too hard for thee. I know thy strength to an inch." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Morning {{and evening}} we work away pretty stiff. It is {{infantry}} drill we have. They {{say we are}} not going to fight on the camels, but only to be carried along by them and to get off and fight if we see the enemy, and as we are all new to each other there is a good bit of work to be done to get us down to work as one battalion. We and the 4th make a troop together. We have drill in the afternoon, too, for a bit. Of a morning those that like can go across and have a look at the town. I went yesterday. Rum old place, isn't it? The rummiest thing is the way those little donkeys get about with a fat chap perched on the top of a saddle two feet above them. Never saw such mokes in my life. They ain't bigger than good-sized dogs some of them, and yet they go along with fifteen or sixteen stone on their backs as if they did not feel it. Those and the camels pleased me most. Rum beasts those camels. I can't think what it must feel like to be stuck up on top of them, and if one does fall off it must be like coming off a church. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> one?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Would {{the reader}} wish {{to look into}} this Nosti-Grumkow Correspondence at all? I advise him, not. Good part of it still lies in the Paper-Office here; [Prussian Despatches, vols. xl. xli.: in a fragmentary state; {{so much of it}} as they had caught up, and tried to make use of;--far too much.] likely to be {{published}} by the Prussian Dryasdust in coming time: but a more sordid mass of eavesdroppings, kitchen-ashes and floor-sweepings, collected and interchanged by a pair of treacherous Flunkies (big bullying Flunky and little trembling cringing one, Grumkow and Reichenbach), was never got together out of a gentleman's household. To no idlest reader, armed even with barnacles, and holding mouth and nose, can the stirring-up of such a dust-bin be long tolerable. But the amazing problem was this Editor's, doomed to spell the Event into clearness if he could, and put dates, physiognomy and outline to it, by help of such Flunky-Sanscrit!--That Nosti-Grumkow Correspondence, as we now have it in the Paper-Office,--interpretable only by acres of British Despatches, by incondite dateless helpless Prussian Books ("printed Blotches of Human Stupor," [...] as Smelfungus calls them): how gladly would one return them all to St. Mary Axe, there to lie through Eternity! It is like holding dialogue with a rookery; asking your way (perhaps in flight for life, as was partly my own case) by colloquy with successive or even simultaneous Rookeries. Reader, <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>tried</b> such a thing? An adventure, never to be spoken of again, when once DONE! ...|$|E

6000|$|Nay, do not {{trouble to}} look at the sky without. It will rain till the dawn. Listen! The {{boulders}} are talking tonight in the bed of the river. Hear them!
