25|$|Inspired by {{the events}} of May 1968 in France, Fo and Rame {{abandoned}} the official state theatre in Italy and set up Associazione Nuova Scena, a theatre collective operating outside the state structure. They asked the PCI for assistance and access to community centres and workers' clubs. In October 1968, they toured Fo's latest play Grande pantomima con bandiere e pupazzi piccoli e medi (Grand Pantomime with Flags and Small and Middle-sized Puppets), opening in Cesena. The play, which featured masks instead of characters—representing Capital, the Confederation of Industry, <b>High</b> <b>Finance,</b> the Church, the People, Rebels and Peasants—included a giant puppet representing fascism which gave birth to representatives of the Church, the Monarchy, the Army and Industrialism. L'operaio conosce 300 parole, il padrone 1,000: per questo lui è il padrone (The Worker Knows 300 Words, the Boss Knows 1000, That's Why He's the Boss), Legami pure che tanto io spacco tutto lo stesso (Chain Me Up and I'll Still Smash Everything) and Mistero Buffo (Comical Mystery Play), also date from this time. Though Fo himself had never been a Communist Party member, his open criticism of PCI methods and policies on the stage led to conflict with the Party.|$|E

40|$|AbstractHigher {{education}} {{is important for}} countries for several reasons. It is a significant step for countries in achieving higher levels of development. The quality and efficiency of higher education are necessary to reach {{a high level of}} country's human capital. Each country uses a different <b>higher</b> education <b>financing</b> model with a different success rate. While some countries apply mainly private sector <b>financing,</b> others employ <b>higher</b> education systems which are financed by public sectors. The contribution of public sector to <b>higher</b> education <b>financing</b> varies significantly in each country. There have been important developments in higher education systems in many countries recently. As a result of developments in this area, the balance between the contribution levels of private and public sectors to <b>higher</b> education <b>financing</b> has changed. The current study discusses the different applications of <b>higher</b> education <b>financing</b> systems and analyzes the contribution of different actors participating in <b>higher</b> education <b>financing.</b> <b>Higher</b> education <b>financing</b> systems in different countries are examined. The first part of this study focuses on the theoretical framework of higher education services, and the second part provides a comparison of the shares of the actors who contribute to <b>higher</b> education <b>financing</b> in the countries in question. Thus, a comparative analysis of higher education system among countries is conducted. The last part consists of conclusions and recommendations...|$|R

[...] Stone clarified that Madoff will not be mentioned in the film, commenting that he considered Madoff's actions to be [...] "a crook running a Ponzi scheme" [...] which is [...] "legal robbery." [...] The filmmaker returned to the project in April on the strength of this script, feeling Loeb's draft was [...] "so great" [...] that he did not feel the need to touch it, although he did have the option.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is twofold. At first, we {{consider}} efficiency oriented aspects of public versus private <b>higher</b> education <b>financing.</b> We briefly summarize the market failure debate. We analyse the interplay between uncertainty of the returns of education, individual educational choice and <b>higher</b> education <b>financing.</b> Subsequently, we discuss <b>higher</b> education <b>financing</b> {{in the presence of}} distortive taxation and asymmetric information. Then, we consider equity aspects of <b>higher</b> education <b>financing.</b> We review the vast literature providing empirical evidence on the distributional effects and identify possible caveats when it comes to apply the results to the policy debate. We conclude that neither efficiency nor equity arguments provide a convincing rationale for a comprehensive role of the public in <b>higher</b> education <b>financing.</b> We argue in favour of a success-dependent participation of students in the costs of higher education.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to make {{conclusions}} regarding the allocation of EU structural funds in the programming period 2004 - 2006 in Latvian regions as well as to give suggestions for the optimization of allocation of EU cohesion policy financing in Latvian regions. Data of the allocation of EU structural funds in the programming period 2004 - 2006 shows that the allocation is proportional to distribution of inhabitants in the regions and that the most part of <b>financing</b> and the <b>highest</b> <b>financing</b> per capita has been received by most developed regions. Exception is the priority No. 4 “Promotion of Development of Rural Areas and Fisheries” where <b>higher</b> <b>financing</b> per capita was received by less developed regions. Using the methodology which was used to allocate EU funds in the programming period 2007 - 2013 between NUTS II regions and statistical data for the year 2005 the allocation of EU funds in Latvian NUTS III regions has been calculated. The proposed methodology earmarks <b>highest</b> <b>financing</b> per capita to less developed regions and eliminates situation where the allocation is proportional to the distribution of inhabitants in the regions. At the same time the establishment of regional quotas requires creation of EU funds regional programmes and thus significant changes in the EU funds management system...|$|R

Soon after the event, he stated that Laurene [...] "was {{right there in the}} front row in the lecture hall, and I couldn't take my eyes off of her ... kept losing my train of thought, and started feeling a little giddy." [...] After the lecture, Jobs met up with her in the parking lot and invited her out to dinner. From that point forward, they were together, with a few minor exceptions, {{for the rest of his}} life. Powell's father died when she was very young, and her mother raised her in a middle class New Jersey home similar to the one Jobs grew up in. After she {{received}} her B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania, she spent a short period in <b>high</b> <b>finance</b> but found it didn't interest her, so she decided to pursue her MBA at Stanford instead.

40|$|AbstractWith gradual {{deepening}} of {{the reform}} of economic and educational systems, Chinese <b>higher</b> education <b>finance</b> has experienced an evolutionary process, transforming from the highly-centralized finance system into a government-led, multi-channel cost-sharing system. Its appropriation system has shifted from incremental funding and single- parameter formula funding approaches into the pattern that lays more stress on equity, efficiency and quality.
