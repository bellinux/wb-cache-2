5|$|I was {{as student}} in the sixties, engaged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> <b>rights</b> movement, anti-Vietnam War protests. I'd come from New York to attend the University of Wisconsin.

We had developed a legal clinic {{and we had a}} whole health program, but the city was too small. I had, of course, heard about Uptown in Chicago, and the challenges. So I wound up here in 1976. I waited tables. I did photography, took pictures for attorneys. Ultimately we started our own print shop in order to print our own newspapers and magazines.|$|E

Further protections were enacted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Rights</b> Act of 1960, which allowed federal courts to appoint referees to conduct voter registration in jurisdictions that engaged in voting discrimination against racial minorities.|$|E
