5000|$|Like {{most of the}} {{relatively}} few women photographers on Picture Post, Deutsch shot a number of [...] "soft" [...] stories, including a couple on nursery schools and a long saga involving two children and their lost poodle. Her own daughters featured frequently, looking in a mirror or riding on a donkey - or, indeed, hunting Richmond Park for the missing pet dog. But she also used her connections to shoot stories that combined the political with the cultural, for example in that of the theatre company, composed entirely of exiled Austrians, performing - in German - The Good Soldier Schweik at the Lantern Theatre in Kilburn. Or, again, featuring children such as those who gathered at the Hampstead home of the architect Ernő Goldfinger to create pictures of the War, for an exhibition of children's drawings of the War 5/1940. From the 1940s through to the 1960s, she also took [...] "story portraits" [...] of writers and artists, from author John Cowper Powys in Wales to the sculptor Lynn Chadwick at his Gloucestershire studio to a great many authors and actors in London (<b>Julian</b> Huxley, J.B. <b>Priestley,</b> W. H. Auden and the Redgrave family among them).|$|R

40|$|<b>Julian</b> <b>Priestley</b> {{takes an}} {{in-depth}} look at David Cameron’s speech on the UK’s relationship with Europe. He finds that that it fell into familiar Eurosceptic fallacies about the EU, ignored linkages between regulation and the internal market, and overestimated the UK’s chances of renegotiating {{the relationship with the}} EU. Instead, he writes, this morning’s speech was solely designed to shore up Cameron’s own position in the Conservative party and to counter UKIP’s increasing anti-EU rhetoric...|$|E
