5|$|As al-Mansur's {{persecution}} intensified, pressure {{began to}} mount on the brothers to react. Kufa, the traditional Alid base, was <b>kept</b> <b>under</b> close surveillance by the Abbasid government, {{and the two}} brothers resolved to launch a simultaneous rebellion in Basra and Medina. Although the Alids could count on a large network of sympathizers throughout the Caliphate, the action was rushed and lacked organization.|$|E

5|$|Rubidium reacts violently {{with water}} and can cause fires. To ensure safety and purity, this metal is usually <b>kept</b> <b>under</b> a dry mineral oil or sealed in glass {{ampoules}} in an inert atmosphere. Rubidium forms peroxides on exposure even to small amount of air diffused into the oil, and storage is subject to similar precautions as the storage of metallic potassium.|$|E
5|$|A surface {{marker buoy}} (SMB) with a reel and line {{is often used}} by a dive leader to allow the boat to monitor {{progress}} of the dive group. This can provide the operator with a positive control of depth, by remaining slightly negative and using the buoyancy of the float to support this slight over-weighting. This allows the line to be <b>kept</b> <b>under</b> slight tension which {{reduces the risk of}} entanglement. The reel or spool used to store and roll up the line usually has slightly negative buoyancy, so that if released it will hang down and not float away.|$|E
5|$|Blood-C: The Last Dark is set {{six months}} after the events of Blood-C; in the {{universe}} of Blood-C humanity is secretly preyed upon by a race called the Elder Bairns, whose feeding is <b>kept</b> <b>under</b> control by an ancient agreement called Shrovetide. The Last Dark follows Saya Kisaragi as she pursues Fumito Nanahara—the human guardian of Shrovetide who manipulated and betrayed her—through Tokyo {{with the help of an}} underground organization called SIRRUT.|$|E

5|$|Cacti {{are often}} grown in greenhouses, {{particularly}} in regions unsuited to {{the cultivation of}} cacti outdoors, such the northern parts of Europe and North America. Here, they may be kept in pots or grown in the ground. Cacti are also grown as houseplants, many being tolerant of the often dry atmosphere. Cacti in pots may be placed outside in the summer to ornament gardens or patios, and then <b>kept</b> <b>under</b> cover during the winter. Less drought-resistant epiphytes, such as epiphyllum hybrids, Schlumbergera (the Thanksgiving or Christmas cactus) and Hatiora (the Easter cactus), are widely cultivated as houseplants.|$|E
5|$|Edward was <b>kept</b> <b>under</b> {{the strict}} tutorship of Hansell until almost {{thirteen}} years old. Private tutors taught him German and French. Edward took the examination to enter Osborne Naval College, and began there in 1907. Hansell had wanted Edward to enter school earlier, but the prince's father had disagreed. Following {{two years at}} Osborne College, {{which he did not}} enjoy, Edward moved on to the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth. A course of two years, followed by entry into the Royal Navy, was planned. A bout of mumps may have made him infertile.|$|E
5|$|Forest pests {{present a}} {{significant}} problem {{because it is not}} easy to access the canopy and monitor pest populations. In addition, forestry pests such as bark beetles, <b>kept</b> <b>under</b> control by natural enemies in their native range, may be transported large distances in cut timber to places where they have no natural predators, enabling them to cause extensive economic damage. Pheromone traps have been used to monitor pest populations in the canopy. These release volatile chemicals that attract males. Pheromone traps can detect the arrival of pests or alert foresters to outbreaks. For example, spruce budworm has been monitored using pheromone traps in Canadian forests for several decades.|$|E

5|$|In 1987 a clock {{tower and}} a {{fountain}} were erected at Council Negri Monument. A centenary stone that was erected in 1967 {{to commemorate the}} event is <b>kept</b> <b>under</b> the clock tower. The Bintulu Tua Pek Kong temple (near Tamu Bintulu) {{is believed to have}} been built in the 1890s to purge the town from evil spirits. The temple survived World War II, and was rebuilt after the discovery of oil and gas reserves offshore.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 {{the kibbutz}} decided after four gatherings {{to appoint a}} team of members to discuss the {{privatization}} of electricity, food, mail, barbershop and cosmetics. Other services were to be <b>kept</b> <b>under</b> {{the responsibility of the}} kibbutz, these include: healthcare, education and welfare. The dispute mainly concerned the privatization of the dining room. At the end of the discussions, most privatization initiatives were rejected, and only a few minor changes that had no practical effect on the collective lifestyle were accepted.|$|E
5|$|In Bhimsen's absence, Rajendra Bikram Shah {{established}} a new battalion, Hanuman Dal, to be <b>kept</b> <b>under</b> his personal command. By February 1837, both Rana Jang Pande and his brother, Ranadal Pande, had {{been promoted to}} the position of a kaji; and Ranajang was made a personal secretary to the King, while Ranadal Pande was made the governor of Palpa. Ranjang was also made the chief palace guard, the position formerly occupied by Ranbir Singh and then Bhimsen. Thus, this curtailed Bhimsen's access to the royal family. On 14 June 1837, the King took over the command of all the battalions put in charge of various courtiers, and himself became the Commander-in-Chief.|$|E

Bond is <b>kept</b> <b>under</b> observation as he suffers electric shocks, burns and an encounter with large poisonous spiders. Bond's ordeal ends in a fight with a captive giant squid, which he defeats by using improvised weapons. After his escape he encounters Rider, who has been pegged out to be eaten by crabs; they had ignored her and she managed to escape.|$|E
5|$|Propagation both by {{seed and}} {{cuttings}} is difficult, reducing potential production by plant nurseries. Germination rates of soil-stored seeds {{have been found}} to increase substantially with the application of heat and aqueous solutions of smoke. The most satisfactory results from cuttings can be achieved by using tip growth, taken six weeks after the cessation of flowering, and <b>kept</b> <b>under</b> a fogging system for twenty weeks. Plantsman Neil Marriott recommends semi-hardened cutting material taken in spring and autumn. Roots of cuttings are brittle and easily damaged.|$|E
5|$|R. Parthiepan as Chola King, {{successor}} {{and last}} of the Chola dynasty after escaping an attack from the Pandyas. The city that the Cholas lived in perished, resulting in the city becoming haunted with Parthiepan, {{the head of the}} people. The images for the Chola King, not dated or named in the film, were <b>kept</b> <b>under</b> wraps prior to the movie's release. Parthiepan signed for the role after much speculation that Dhanush would be selected, and his performance won plaudits from critics.|$|E

Pulverized fruit bodies were also <b>kept</b> <b>under</b> bandages made of soft-tanned deerskin. In Scarborough, England, the fruit bodies used to be arranged with moss and leaves and sold as a table decoration.|$|E
5|$|Security, {{services}} and logistics {{at the reception}} centres were provided by the military component of UNTAG, {{and a number of}} secondary reception centres were also established. The movement of returnees through the centres was quick, and the repatriation programme was very successful; a UN official report stated that the psychological impact of the return of so many exiles was perceptible throughout the country. There were some problems reported in the north, where ex-Koevoet elements searched villages for SWAPO returnees; however, the UN reported that this was <b>kept</b> <b>under</b> constant surveillance by UNTAG's police monitors. By the end of the process, 42,736 Namibians had been returned from exile.|$|E
5|$|The {{ceremony}} is often held weeks, months, or {{years after the}} death so that the deceased's family can raise the significant funds needed to cover funeral expenses. Torajans traditionally believe that death is not a sudden, abrupt event, but a gradual process toward Puya (the land of souls, or afterlife). During the waiting period, {{the body of the}} deceased is wrapped in several layers of cloth and <b>kept</b> <b>under</b> the tongkonan. The soul of the deceased is thought to linger around the village until the funeral {{ceremony is}} completed, after which it begins its journey to Puya.|$|E
