30|$|The 2 TP {{dosimetry}} estimates correlated highly {{with those}} from the 3 TP data for all tissues (Spearman r[*]>[*] 0.99, P[*]<[*] 0.0001) with small relative errors between the methods, particularly for the kidney and the tumor, with median relative errors not exceeding 2 % and <b>interdecile</b> <b>ranges</b> spanning over less than 6 % and 4 %, respectively, for the per-cycle and cumulative estimates. For the bone marrow, the errors were slightly greater (median errors <[*] 6 %, <b>interdecile</b> <b>ranges</b> <[*] 14 %). Overall, the strength of correlations of the absorbed dose estimates from the simplified methods {{with those from}} the 3 TP scans tended to progressively decrease, and the relative errors to increase, in the following order: 2 TP, 2 TP/ 1 TPD 3, 1 TPD 3, 2 TP/ 1 TPD 1, and 2 TP/NI. For the tumor, the 2 TP/NI scenario was highly inaccurate due to the interference of the therapeutic response. There was an excellent inter-observer agreement between the three observers, in particular for the renal absorbed dose estimated using the 3 TP and 2 TP methods, with mean errors lesser than 1 % {{and standard deviations of}} 5 % or lower. The eGFR · LBW and eGFR · BSA products best predicted the ratio of IA to the renal dose (GBq/Gy) for the first cycle (Spearman r =[*] 0.41 and 0.39, respectively; P <[*] 0.001). For the first cycle, the personalized IA proportional to eGFR · LBW or eGFR · BSA decreased the range of delivered renal absorbed dose between patients as compared with the fixed IA. For the subsequent cycles, the optimal personalized IA could be determined based on the prior cycle renal GBq/Gy with an error of less than 21 % in 90 % of patients.|$|R
40|$|Background: Prospective {{studies have}} {{consistently}} found that postmenopausal {{breast cancer risk}} increases with circulating estrogens; however, findings from studies of estrogens andmammographic density (MD), an intermediate marker of breast cancer risk, have been inconsistent. We investigated the cross-sectional associations of urinary estrogens, and their 2 -, 4 -, and 16 -hydroxylated metabolites with MD. Methods: Postmenopausal women without breast cancer (n 194), ages 48 to 82 years, and reporting no current menopausal hormone therapy use were enrolled at a clinic in Western NY in 2005. Urinary estrogens and estrogen metabolites were measured using mass spectrometry. Percent MD and dense area (cm 2) were measured using computer-assisted analyses of digitized films. Linear regressionmodelswere used to estimate associations of log-transformed estrogen measures with MD while adjusting for age, body mass index (BMI), parity, and past hormone therapy use. Results:Urinary concentrations ofmost individual estrogens andmetaboliteswere not associatedwithMD; however, across the interdecile rangeof the ratio of parent estrogens (estrone andestradiol) to theirmetabolites, MD increased by 6. 8 percentage points (P 0. 02) and dense area increased by 10. 3 cm 2 (P 0. 03). Across the <b>interdecile</b> <b>ranges</b> of the ratios of 2 -, 4 -, and 16 -hydroxylationpathways to theparent estrogens,MDdeclinedby 6. 2 (P 0. 03), 6. 4 (P 0. 04), and 5. 7 (P 0. 05) percentage points, respectively. All associations remained apparent in models without adjustment for BMI. Conclusion: In this study of postmenopausal women, less extensive hydroxylation of parent estrogens was associated with higher MD.

40|$|Aircraft {{observations}} of meteorological, trace gas, and aerosol properties were made between May and September  2013 {{in the southeastern}} United States (US). Regionally representative aggregate vertical profiles of median and <b>interdecile</b> <b>ranges</b> of the measured parameters were constructed from 37 individual aircraft profiles made in the afternoon when a well-mixed boundary layer with typical fair-weather cumulus was present (Wagner et al., 2015). We use these 0 – 4  km aggregate profiles and a simple model to calculate the sensitivity of aerosol optical depth (AOD) to changes in dry aerosol mass, relative humidity, mixed-layer height, the central diameter and width of the particle size distribution, hygroscopicity, and dry and wet refractive index, while holding the other parameters constant. The calculated sensitivity {{is a result of}} both the intrinsic sensitivity and the observed range of variation in these parameters. These observationally based sensitivity studies indicate that the relationship between AOD and dry aerosol mass in these conditions in the southeastern US can be highly variable and is especially sensitive to relative humidity (RH). For example, calculated AOD ranged from 0. 137 to 0. 305 as the RH was varied between the 10 th and 90 th percentile profiles with dry aerosol mass held constant. Calculated AOD was somewhat less sensitive to aerosol hygroscopicity, mean size, and geometric standard deviation, σ g. However, some chemistry–climate models prescribe values of σ g substantially larger than we or others observe, leading to potential high biases in model-calculated AOD of [*]∼[*]  25  %. Finally, AOD was least sensitive to observed variations in dry and wet aerosol refractive index and to changes in the height of the well-mixed surface layer. We expect these findings to be applicable to other moderately polluted and background continental air masses in which an accumulation mode between 0. 1 – 0. 5  µm diameter dominates aerosol extinction...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{examine the}} {{validity}} of self reported data on safety belt use and to consider the implications for research on injury prevention behaviors. METHODS: 1992 and 1993 self reported data on safety belt use {{were obtained from the}} Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and observational data were obtained from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administrations for 49 states in 1992 and 50 states in 1993. The ratio of self reported to observed belt use was calculated for each state, and linear regression models were used to examine the association between the two methods. RESULTS: There was variation between states, but the overall median ratio of self reported to observed safety belt use was 1. 05 in 1992 (<b>interdecile</b> <b>range</b> 0. 87 - 1. 36) and 1. 02 in 1993 (<b>interdecile</b> <b>range</b> 0. 87 - 1. 31). Self reports were substantially higher in southern states and in states with the lowest levels of observed use. Linear regression models indicated a moderately strong association between state estimates using both methods. For every percentage point increase in self reported data in 1993, observed safety belt use increased by 0. 95 percentage point. CONCLUSIONS: In the aggregate, self reported estimates were only 2 % to 5 % higher than observed estimates. This is a substantial improvement from previous studies. This is probably due to the increased prevalence of safety belt use and the declining effects of social desirability on self reported use. In general, {{the validity of}} self reported estimates of socially desirable injury prevention behaviors will be higher when the actual prevalence of the behavior is higher, but lower when this is not true...|$|E

Further, despite the different imaging techniques, we obtained a similar median effective half-life for the kidney (47  h, Table 2; vs. 51  h in [8]), although we observed a wider inter-patient variability. For Tumormax, the 1 TPD 3 technique was slightly less accurate when applied to our data, but the range of errors was comparable.|$|E
30|$|Finally, we {{revisited}} our personalized IA prescription {{scheme for}} our P-PRRT protocol. For the first cycle, we derived a simpler equation {{to determine the}} personalized IA than the one we initially suggested [6]. The latter is still based on the product of eGFR and BSA, but eGFR · LBW would have provided a similar level of predictive accuracy. We acknowledge that this accuracy is at most moderate and {{comparable to that of}} an initial fixed IA in terms of interquartile or <b>interdecile</b> <b>range</b> (Fig.  6). However, the main advantage of personalizing the first cycle IA is to avoid extreme cases of overdosing, such as delivery 18  Gy to the kidney when administering a fixed IA of 9.1  GBq to every patient (Fig.  6). Rather, personalizing IA could limit the renal absorbed dose to 11  Gy, for the same median of 5  Gy. When 68 Ga-octreotate PET will be routinely performed in all our PRRT patients, we will explore adding the pre-treatment tumor sink effect analysis into the prescription scheme, which could potentially improve the predictive accuracy of the model [18].|$|E

The alpha/beta ratio in plasma and leucocytes was clearly a better discriminator between obligate heterozygotes and controls than alpha-galactosidase activity alone, but still failed to detect 3 obligates with leucocytes and 2 with plasma.

The <b>interdecile</b> <b>range</b> of log (alpha-galactosidase/beta-galactosidase activity) in 20 hair follicles from each of 4 obligate and 7 suspected heterozygotes was clearly different from 11 control subjects.

BackgroundExperimental and epidemiological evidence suggest that long-term exposure to air pollution might have a causal role in atherogenesis, but epidemiological findings are still inconsistent. We investigate whether urban particulate matter (PM) air pollution is associated with CIMT, a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis. MethodsWe used baseline data (2000 to 2003) from the HNR (Heinz Nixdorf Recall) study, a population-based cohort of 4, 814 participants, 45 to 75 years of age. We assessed residential long-term exposure to PM with a chemistry transport model and measured distance to high traffic. Multiple linear regression was used to estimate associations of air pollutants and traffic with CIMT, adjusting for each other, city of residence, age, sex, diabetes, and lifestyle variables.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Several studies {{indicate}} {{that only a small}} proportion of patients with acute ischaemic stroke are treated with intravenous thrombolysis. Indications and contraindications for this treatment are usually based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria of randomised clinical trials. The trial context of these criteria hampers implementation in real life settings. We therefore aimed to obtain specialist opinion in a Delphi consensus on these contraindications. METHODS: We used the Delphi approach on an international group of specialists in the field of thrombolysis. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were reworded into 18 quantitatively phrased propositions. Feedback consisted of the median score, interquartile range and the panellist's own score in the previous round. For each item, we defined consensus as the achievement of an <b>interdecile</b> <b>range</b> within two prespecified clinically relevant units. RESULTS: Thirty-one specialists participated in the first round and 30 completed all three rounds. Consensus was reached on 12 of the 18 propositions: previous ischaemic stroke, head trauma and gastrointestinal tract bleeding should not have taken place earlier than 1. 5 months, 2 months and 14 days, respectively; the severity of the neurological deficit is defined as a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 2 - 3 or more, and blood pressure level should not be > 185 / 110 mmHg; platelet count should be > 90 x 10 (12) /l, glucose levels 2. 7 - 22 mmol/l, international normalised ratio < 1. 5 and activated partial thromboplastin time < 50 s. No consensus was reached on propositions concerning the stroke onset to treatment time, patient's age, recent medical procedures, spontaneous improvement rate and blood pressure treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We present specialists' opinion on contraindications for intravenous thrombolysis in ischaemic stroke.

40|$|Plasma {{cytokine}} levels predict {{mortality in}} patients with acute renal failure. BackgroundCritically ill patients with acute renal failure (ARF) experience a high mortality rate. Animal and human studies suggest that proinflammatory cytokines {{lead to the development}} of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which is temporally followed by a counter anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS). This process has not been specifically described in critically ill patients with ARF. MethodsThe Program to Improve Care in Acute Renal Disease (PICARD) is a prospective, multicenter cohort study designed to examine the natural history, practice patterns, and outcomes of treatment in critically ill patients with ARF. In a subset of 98 patients with ARF, we measured plasma proinflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL) - 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 8, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) ], the acute-phase reactant C-reactive protein (CRP), and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 10 at study enrollment and over the course of illness. ResultsWhen compared with healthy subjects and end-stage renal disease patients on maintenance hemodialysis, patients with ARF had significantly higher plasma levels of all measured cytokines. Additionally, the proinflammatory cytokines IL- 6 and IL- 8 were significantly higher in nonsurvivors versus survivors [median 234. 7 (<b>interdecile</b> <b>range</b> 64. 8 to 1775. 9) pg/mL vs. 113. 5 (46. 1 to 419. 3) pg/mL, P = 0. 02 for IL- 6; 35. 5 (14. 1 to 237. 9) pg/mL vs. 21. 2 (8. 5 to 87. 1) pg/mL, P = 0. 03 for IL- 8]. The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 10 was also significantly higher in nonsurvivors [3. 1 (0. 5 to 41. 9) pg/mL vs. 2. 4 (0. 5 to 16. 9) pg/mL, P = 0. 04]. For each natural log unit increase in the levels of IL- 6, IL- 8, and IL- 10, the odds of death increased by 65 %, 54 %, and 34 %, respectively, corresponding to increases in relative risk of approximately 30 %, 25 %, and 15 %. The presence or absence of SIRS or sepsis was not a major determinant of plasma cytokine concentration in this group of patients. ConclusionThere is evidence of ongoing SIRS with concomitant CARS in critically ill patients with ARF, with higher levels of plasma IL- 6, IL- 8, and IL- 10 {{in patients with}} ARF who die during hospitalization.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundSexual {{violence}} is increasingly recognised {{as a public}} health issue. Information about prevalence, associated factors, and consequences for health in the population of Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales) is scarce. The third National Survey of Sexual Health Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal- 3) is the first of the Natsal surveys to include questions about sexual violence and the first population-based survey in Britain to explore the issue outside the context of crime. MethodsBetween Sept 6, 2010, and Aug 31, 2012, we did a probability sample survey of women and men aged 16 – 74 years living in Britain. We asked participants about their experience of sex against their will since age 13 years and the circumstances surrounding the most recent occurrence. We explored associations between ever experiencing non-volitional sex and a range of sociodemographic, health, and behavioural factors. We used logistic regression to estimate age-adjusted odds ratios to analyse factors associated with the occurrence of completed non-volitional sex in women and men. FindingsWe interviewed 15   162 people. Completed non-volitional sex was reported by 9 · 8 % (95 % CI 9 · 0 – 10 · 5) of women and 1 · 4 % (1 · 1 – 1 · 7) of men. Median age (<b>interdecile</b> <b>range)</b> at most recent occurrence was 18 years (14 – 32) for women and 16 years (13 – 30) for men. Completed non-volitional sex varied by family structure and, in women, by age, education, and area-level deprivation. It was associated with poor health, longstanding illness or disability, and treatment for mental health conditions, smoking, and use of non-prescription drugs in the past year in both sexes, and with binge drinking in women. Completed non-volitional sex was also associated with reporting of first heterosexual intercourse before 16 years of age, same-sex experience, more lifetime sexual partners, ever being diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection, and low sexual function in both sexes, and, in women, with abortion and pregnancy outcome before 18 years of age. In most cases, the person responsible was known to the individual, although {{the nature of the relationship}} differed by age at most recent occurrence. Participants who were younger at interview were more likely to have told someone about the event and to have reported it to the police than were older participants. InterpretationThese data provide the first population prevalence estimates of non-volitional sex in Britain. We showed it to be mainly an experience of young age and strongly associated with a range of adverse health outcomes in both women and men.
