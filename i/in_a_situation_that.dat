This raised a new debate concerning public or private operations, with many Conservative politicians calling for the privatization of KKS. In the 1904 municipal election the issue was raised, with the Liberal Party and the socialist parties running for municipalization of tram operations. Meanwhile, the municipal administration worked with estimates for taking over KSS. A take-over would cost the municipality about NOK2 million, while a sale would bring in about NOK1.6 million. However, as KSS was a profitable company, {{it was estimated that}} the municipality would make more money by taking over KSS than selling KKS, estimated at about NOK3 million for the period in question.|$|E

25|$|A varying {{number of}} marines (epibatai), usually 10–20, were carried aboard for {{boarding}} actions. At the Battle of Salamis, each Athenian ship was recorded to have 14 hoplites and 4 archers (usually Scythian mercenaries) on board, but Herodotus narrates that the Chiots had 40 hoplites on board at Lade {{and that the}} Persian ships carried a similar number. This reflects the different practices between the Athenians and other, less professional navies. Whereas the Athenians relied on speed and maneuverability, where their highly trained crews had the advantage, other states favored boarding, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> closely mirrored the one that developed during the First Punic War. Grappling hooks would be used both as a weapon and for towing damaged ships (ally or enemy) back to shore. When the triremes were alongside each other, marines would either spear the enemy or hop across and cut the enemy down with their swords. As the presence of too many heavily armed hoplites on deck tended to destabilize the ship, the epibatai were normally seated, only rising to carry out any boarding action. The hoplites belonged to the middle social classes, so that they came immediately next to the trierarch in status aboard the ship.|$|E

Although {{the cost}} of publishing has increased over the years, the price of newspapers has generally remained low, forcing newspapers to rely more on advertising revenue and on articles provided by a major wire service, such as the Associated Press or Reuters, for their national and world coverage. With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as Gannett or McClatchy, which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have [...] "alternative weeklies" [...] to complement the mainstream daily papers, for example, New York City's The Village Voice or Los Angeles' LA Weekly, to name two of the best-known. Major cities may also support a local business journal, trade papers relating to local industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups. Early versions of the American newspaper comic strip and the American comic book began appearing in the 19th century. In 1938, Superman, the comic book superhero of DC Comics, developed into an American icon.

500|$|... "Roadrunners" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Den of Geek writer Juliette Harrisson named the episode the [...] "finest stand-alone episode" [...] of the show's eighth season. Harrisson praised the character development in [...] "Roadrunners" [...] {{and noted that}} the episode [...] "effectively brings [...] together as partners." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two note that, [...] "for the first half-hour, this works as a slow burn horror story... It's the transition of Gillian Anderson's performance from wry exasperation to outright paranoia... which makes this so effective." [...] Shearman and Pearson did, however, slightly criticize the cutting of John Doggett's role to a minimum. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "A–" [...] and wrote that it [...] "is an episode that’s dedicated to helping us move past the Mulder era." [...] He praised the creepiness of Gilligan's script, {{as well as the}} characterization of Scully, writing that even though she is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> is over her head, she is still smart in her attempts to escape; he also praised Anderson's acting. However, VanDerWerff was more critical of the final scene, noting that it made Doggett come across as [...] "kind of an asshole". Paul Spragg of Xposé wrote positively of the episode, saying it features a [...] "return to the body horror stories that had worked so well in the early seasons".

I prefer Darin Morgan's {{version of the}} character , but I doubt that version could support a full episode about God {{in the same way}} that this more searching, and lost, Scully does." [...] However, Handlen was critical of some of the religious aspects of the episode, noting that [...] "If there's a Christian God in the X-Files universe, doesn't that trump just about everything else that Mulder and Scully have spent their time on?... There are too many implications here for the show to support, and while it doesn't destroy the episode, it does make it difficult for me to back it as fully as I'd like to." [...] John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a 7 out of 10 rating, noting [...] "Overall, this episode highlights Scully and her faith, and in the process, manages to presage many of the future plot developments for the series and her character. The spiritual war at the foundation of the series mythology is reflected <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>situation</b> <b>that</b> speaks directly to Scully and her upbringing, and though some of the religious metaphors are heavy-handed, it works well enough." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B+ and wrote positively of the episode's [...] "inventiveness," [...] which [...] "derives from its choice of the most mainstream paranormality of all—Christianity." [...] The review also wrote positively of the Mulder-Scully role reversal, calling the change [...] "always welcome". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. She noted that [...] "Scully's search to reconcile her religious beliefs and her scientific training makes for powerful drama, and Gillian Anderson is up to the challenge." [...] Vitaris, however, criticized elements of the plot, most notably the [...] "un-saintly" [...] quality of Kevin and Kevin's lack of emotion after his mother is killed. Furthermore, she called the ending [...] "a real mess". Not all reviews were positive. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five, and called it a [...] "peculiarly bloodless episode". The two wrote that many of the traits possessed by Kevin were only helpful in certain isolated scenes, such as the ability to bilocate. Shearman and Pearson concluded that the show should [...] "take a serious subject by all means, but then take the subject seriously." ...|$|E

2500|$|Emergent-Norm Theory - {{according}} to Ralph Turner and Lewis Killian (1957), crowds begin as collectivities composed {{of people with}} mixed interests and motives.
