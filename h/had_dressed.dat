5|$|The {{remaining}} festivities {{were called}} off after {{an assassination attempt}} on the Huguenot leader Admiral Coligny, who was shot from a house by an arquebusier on 22 August and wounded in the elbow and hand. The day before, the king and his brothers <b>had</b> <b>dressed</b> as Amazons to fight Navarre and his friends, who wore turbans and golden robes {{in the role of}} Turks. Fighting broke out for real between the Catholics and Huguenots in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, which began on 24 August when Charles IX ordered the slaughter of all the Huguenot leaders in Paris, provoking massacres of Huguenots throughout France. Henry of Navarre was given the choice of death, life imprisonment, or conversion to Catholicism. He chose Catholicism and was spared.|$|E
5|$|A last {{group of}} Romanian units left the UNR {{and headed for}} Kishinev, where a Romanian-friendly Moldavian Democratic Republic was vying for power with the local Bolsheviks. Their action was likely coordinated with the Romanian High Command, {{which at the time}} had began an attack against the western Bessarabian town of Ungheni. The volunteers <b>had</b> <b>dressed</b> as Russian {{soldiers}} during their passage to Iași, but were recognized as Romanian units by the Moldavian and Bolshevik troops garrisoned in Kishinev City Station, where their train stopped on January 6. A skirmish followed, with the Moldavians and Bolsheviks either disarming, or killing or kidnapping Corps soldiers. The survivors were held captive in the same place as Moldavian Army founder Gherman Pântea, and were released later that day, allegedly by Republican troops. Years later, suspicion arose that Pântea had in fact helped the Bolsheviks, as an alleged enemy of Romanian interests in Bessarabia.|$|E
5|$|Malhotra {{suffered}} an ankle injury in November that sidelined him for four games. Upon his recovery, his play was judged by team management to have {{suffered an}}d he began to be benched. Meanwhile, the Canadian national junior team wanted the Rangers to loan him to them for the 2000 World Junior Championships. On December 12, 1999, general manager Neil Smith obliged and assigned Malhotra for the international tournament. He was then sent for a two-week conditioning assignment with the Rangers' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Hartford Wolf Pack. On March 14, 2000, he was sent back down to the OHL in order to retain his eligibility for later AHL assignment in the season. Malhotra <b>had</b> <b>dressed</b> for only four games in the two months between his return from the World Junior Championships in early-January and his junior reassignment. He was pointless in the 27 games total he played with the Rangers that season.|$|E

As part of the deception and distortion of the released videos, O'Keefe added that portion as a lead-in, but he was dressed professionally during his ACORN visits. He never revealed himself on camera in the visits to the ACORN offices.|$|E
25|$|The {{military}} conflicts {{begin in}} 1831. López heads to Córdoba with 2,000 men, Felipe Ibarra returns to Santiago del Estero from Santa Fe, Ángel Pacheco leads {{the armies of}} Buenos Aires, and Quiroga moves to Cuyo (Mendoza, San Luis and San Juan). The initial conflicts prove favourable to the federals: Pacheco defeated the forces of Paz, Ibarra and Benito Villafañe liberated Santiago del Estero and Catamarca, there were local federal rebellions in Córdoba and La Rioja, and Quiroga liberated Mendoza. Still, the most unexpected event {{of the war was}} the capture of general Paz. He <b>had</b> <b>dressed</b> his soldiers as gauchos, and during a reconnaissance mission he confused the troops of López (composed by real gauchos) with his own; his horse was entangled and he was taken prisoner.|$|E

25|$|The couple {{married on}} May 1, 1967, at the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas. The wedding, {{arranged}} by Parker to maximize publicity, featured very few guests and {{was over in}} only eight minutes. It {{was followed by a}} quick press conference and a $10,000 breakfast reception, attended by friends, family, and business associates from MGM, RCA, and the William Morris Agency. The wedding caused rifts between Elvis and several of his closest friends who were not invited to the actual wedding ceremony. Red West, especially, was furious about the situation. He and his wife had been personally invited by Elvis to Las Vegas for the wedding, <b>had</b> <b>dressed</b> for the occasion, and at the last minute were told {{that they would not be}} present. For Red, who had been with Elvis since the beginning of his rise to fame and had given Elvis the role of best man at his own wedding, this was enough of an insult that he decided to quit his job working for Elvis. Many other friends of Elvis were also disappointed and held resentment towards him for many years to follow, although they mainly blamed Parker for their exclusion rather than Elvis himself.|$|E
500|$|Only {{one image}} of Virginia {{is known to}} exist, for which the painter had to take her corpse as model. A few hours after her death, Poe {{realized}} he had no image of Virginia and so commissioned a portrait in watercolor. She is shown wearing [...] "beautiful linen" [...] that Shew said she <b>had</b> <b>dressed</b> her in; Shew {{might have been the}} portrait's artist, though this is uncertain. The image depicts her with a slight double chin and with hazel eyes. The image was passed down to the family of Virginia's half-sister Josephine, wife of Neilson Poe.|$|E
500|$|For Khan and his followers, Fletcher {{created a}} strong {{contrast}} with the highly organized Starfleet uniforms; his idea was that the exiles' costumes were made out of whatever they could find. Fletcher said, [...] "My intention with Khan was to express {{the fact that they}} had been marooned on that planet with no technical infrastructure, so they had to cannibalize from the spaceship whatever they used or wore. Therefore, I tried to make it look as if they <b>had</b> <b>dressed</b> themselves out of pieces of upholstery and electrical equipment that composed the ship." [...] Khan's costume was designed with an open chest to show Ricardo Montalbán's physique. Fletcher also designed smocks for the Regula I scientists, and civilian clothes for Kirk and McCoy that were designed to look practical and comfortable.|$|E

500|$|Costume {{designer}} Robert Fletcher {{wanted to}} emphasize the effects of their harsh environment on Khan and his followers. [...] "My intention with Khan was to express {{the fact that they}} had been marooned on that planet with no technical infrastructure, so they had to cannibalize from the spaceship whatever they used or wore. Therefore, I tried to make it look as if they <b>had</b> <b>dressed</b> themselves out of pieces of upholstery and electrical equipment that composed the ship," [...] he said. Director Nicholas Meyer told Montalbán to keep Khan's right glove on at all times, in order to give viewers a puzzle they could form their own opinions about and add mystery to the character. Meyer has been repeatedly asked if Montalbán wore a prosthetic chest for his scenes, as his uniform was purposefully designed with an open front. Meyer replied in audio commentary for the film that Montalbán (who was 61 during filming) is [...] "one strong cookie," [...] and that no prosthetics were applied to the actor's sizeable frame.|$|E
500|$|Charisma Carpenter had {{originally}} planned {{to read for}} the role of Buffy, but was late for her audition and instead tried out for Cordelia. Carpenter, who <b>had</b> <b>dressed</b> casually {{for the role of}} Buffy—who she believed [...] "could really be herself"—felt unprepared to read for Cordelia because she [...] "was definitely a character to dress for". Although she had only fifteen minutes to prepare for the character, the producers were [...] "really responsive" [...] to Carpenter's audition, and she left feeling confident she had got the part. After Carpenter's audition, actress Sarah Michelle Gellar, who had been offered the role of Cordelia before Carpenter, was asked to come back and audition for the part of Buffy. Bianca Lawson originally won the role of Cordelia Chase, but turned it down due to other contractual obligations. Lawson would later be cast as vampire slayer Kendra in the show's second season. Carpenter, proud of her own character's growth across the two series, did not envy Gellar for winning the role of Buffy over her.|$|E
500|$|The New Zealand backs {{had been}} {{poor in the}} first half, and the side's general form was well below that of earlier in the tour. However New Zealand were {{generally}} {{perceived to be the}} better side in the second half, with the performance of the Welsh fullback Bert Winfield keeping his team in the game. The most controversial moment of the tour happened late in the second half. Wallace recovered a Welsh kick and cut across the field, and with only Winfield to beat, passed to the New Zealand wing Deans. What happened next has provoked intense debate: Deans was tackled by the Welsh and either fell short of the try-line, or placed the ball over it before being dragged back. Dallas, who <b>had</b> <b>dressed</b> in heavy clothing and was struggling {{to keep up with the}} pace of the game, was [...] behind play. When he arrived he ruled that Deans was short of the try-line, and so did not award New Zealand a try. Play continued, but the All Blacks could not score, and Wales won 3–0. This was New Zealand's first loss of the tour.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the same}} time, many {{thoughtful}} hippies distanced {{themselves from the}} very idea that the way a person dresses could be a reliable signal of who he or she was—especially after outright criminals such as Charles Manson began to adopt superficial hippie characteristics, and also after plainclothes policemen started to [...] "dress like hippies" [...] to divide and conquer legitimate members of the counterculture. Frank Zappa, known for lampooning hippie ethos, particularly with songs like [...] "Who Needs the Peace Corps?" [...] (1968), admonished his audience that [...] "we all wear a uniform". The San Francisco clown/hippie Wavy Gravy said in 1987 that he could still see fellow-feeling {{in the eyes of}} Market Street businessmen who <b>had</b> <b>dressed</b> conventionally to survive.|$|E
2500|$|Despite its cleverness and {{positive}} critical response, many fans felt alienated by the shows; certain {{material from the}} Pop album didn't go down as well as U2 might have hoped and many people just didn't seem to get the joke. [...] U2 <b>had</b> <b>dressed</b> as the Village People in the [...] "Discothèque" [...] video, and this willingness to mock their serious image continued during PopMart. [...] (At the Los Angeles Coliseum show on 21 June, tribute was paid to the original [...] "Prefab Four" [...] with a guest appearance by Davy Jones of The Monkees to perform his signature song, [...] "Daydream Believer".) [...] But U2's irony-drenched [...] "big shtick" [...] failed to satisfy many critics and fans seemingly confused by the band's new image and elaborate sets.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{case where}} a teenage woman was barred from her own home {{under the terms of}} an anti-social {{behaviour}} order in 2005, some British national newspapers branded her [...] "the real-life Vicky Pollard" [...] with the Daily Star running headlines reading, [...] "Good riddance to chav scum: real life Vicky Pollard evicted", both referring to a BBC comedy character. [...] Created by radio host Matt Lucas for the show Little Britain, the character Vicky Pollard is a teenage girl intended to parody a chav. A 2006 survey by YouGov suggested 70% of TV industry professionals believed that Vicky Pollard was an accurate reflection of white working-class youth. Also in 2006, Prince William of Wales and his younger brother Prince Harry <b>had</b> <b>dressed</b> up as chavs, resulting in headlines in The Sun naming him [...] "Future Bling of England". The article stated, [...] "William has a great sense of humour and went to a lot of trouble thinking up what to wear".|$|E

2500|$|The defense {{provided}} {{a series of}} witness, described as [...] "brothers, sisters, cousins, and aunts {{of each other and}} the defendants," [...] to provide alibis for the accused. [...] Due to the conflicting testimony provided by various witnesses, the defense took five hours for their closing arguments. [...] Smith used this time to play upon the biases and prejudices of the jury. [...] He argued that the robbers <b>had</b> <b>dressed</b> {{in a manner similar to}} his clients in order to misdirect suspicion upon them and that the robbers had fled to Mexico immediately after the robbery. [...] Then he pointed out that U.S. Marshal Meade had failed to go to the scene of the attack to look for any trail left by the attackers. [...] Smith also claimed the government officials who arrested his clients were more interested in the reward money for capturing the robbers than in finding the people who actually committed the crime. [...] When Smith began to question the integrity of the Court, Judge Sloan threatened him with a $500 fine for contempt.|$|E
2500|$|In 1950, the Almanacs were reconstituted as the Weavers, {{named after}} the title of an 1892 play by Gerhart Hauptmann about a workers' strike (which {{contained}} the lines, [...] "We'll stand it no more, come what may!"). They did benefits for strikers at which they sang songs such as 'Talking Union', about the struggles for unionisation of industrial workers such as miners and auto mobile workers. Besides Pete Seeger (performing under his own name), members of the Weavers included charter Almanac member Lee Hays, Ronnie Gilbert, and Fred Hellerman; later Frank Hamilton, Erik Darling, and Bernie Krause serially took Seeger's place. In {{the atmosphere of the}} 1950s red scare, the Weavers' repertoire had to be less overtly topical than that of the Almanacs had been, and its progressive message was couched in indirect language—arguably rendering it even more powerful. The Weavers on occasion performed in tuxedos (unlike the Almanacs, who <b>had</b> <b>dressed</b> informally) and their managers refused to let them perform at political venues. The Weavers' string of major hits began with [...] "On Top of Old Smoky" [...] and an arrangement of Lead Belly's signature waltz, [...] "Goodnight, Irene", which topped the charts for 13 weeks in 1950 and was covered by many other pop singers. On the flip side of [...] "Irene" [...] was the Israeli song [...] "Tzena, Tzena, Tzena". Other Weaver hits included [...] "Dusty Old Dust" [...] ("So Long It's Been Good to Know You" [...] by Woody Guthrie), [...] "Kisses Sweeter Than Wine" [...] (by Hays, Seeger, and Lead Belly), and the South African Zulu song by Solomon Linda, [...] "Wimoweh" [...] (about Shaka), among others.|$|E
