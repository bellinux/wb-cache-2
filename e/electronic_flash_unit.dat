50|$|A custom <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> <b>unit,</b> the AF130P, {{was part}} of the {{original}} Auto 110 system, and was produced until the camera ceased being manufactured. Pentax responded to criticism that this <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> <b>unit</b> was too large by introducing the smaller AF100P <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> <b>unit</b> in 1980. This unit, however, was never part of the Pentax camera kits and became rare.|$|E

50|$|Honeywell was the U.S. {{importer}} of the Spotmatic. Cameras officially imported by Honeywell {{were labeled}} Honeywell Pentax, instead of Asahi Pentax. The Spotmatic IIa was only {{available as a}} Honeywell Pentax; it was sold exclusively in the USA and had an electronic interface for specific Honeywell Strobonar <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
50|$|A flash is {{a device}} used in {{photography}} producing {{a flash of}} artificial light (typically 1/1000 to 1/200 of a second) at a color temperature of about 5500 K to help illuminate a scene. A major purpose of a flash is to illuminate a dark scene. Other uses are capturing quickly moving objects or changing the quality of light. Flash refers either to the flash of light itself or to the <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> <b>unit</b> discharging the light. Most current flash units are electronic, having evolved from single-use flashbulbs and flammable powders. Modern cameras often activate flash units automatically.|$|E
50|$|A typical <b>{{electronic}}</b> <b>flash</b> <b>unit</b> has {{electronic circuitry}} to charge a high-capacity capacitor {{to several hundred}} volts. When the flash is triggered by the shutter's flash synchronization contact, the capacitor is discharged almost instantaneously through a flash tube, producing a flash of very brief duration almost instantaneously (i.e., the flash duration, often around 1/1000 of a second, is shorter than most practical shutter speeds, and full brightness is reached before the shutter has time to close appreciably). Synchronization of full flash brightness with maximum shutter opening was problematic with bulbs which took an appreciable time to ignite and reach full brightness; electronic flash does not have these difficulties.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{the regular}} Realist, it had fixed focus and fixed aperture. Technical {{requirements}} of macro work {{related to the}} interocular distance of 15 mm dictated that the subject be a certain distance from the camera, so a pair of [...] "arms" [...] located {{in front of the}} lens showed where the subject needed to be. The camera was held by a hand grip with a built-in shutter button and lighting was through an <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> <b>unit</b> sold with the camera. The one missing feature that would have made it a truly convenient point-and-shoot was a motorized film advance, a rare feature indeed for cameras of that era.|$|E
50|$|The Realist 45 also {{features}} the then-standard, old-style hot shoe (referred to as an accessory clip). This was more versatile {{at the time}} it was released because it allowed it to use most contemporary flash accessories, and in recent years it has made it much easier to find an adapter for modern <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> <b>units</b> than it was for the Kodak.|$|R

50|$|Due {{to their}} construction, focal plane shutters, as used on most SLRs, only allow normal xenon <b>flash</b> <b>units</b> {{to be used}} at shutter speeds slow enough that the entire shutter is open at once, {{typically}} at shutter speeds of 1/60 or slower, although some modern cameras may have an X-sync speed as high as 1/500 (e.g. Nikon's D40 DSLRs). Special <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> <b>units</b> for focal-plane shutters fire several times as the slit moves across the film. Electronic shutters used in some digital cameras do not have this limitation and may allow a very high X-sync speed.|$|R
50|$|Accessories for the EM {{included}} a highly automated dedicated <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> <b>unit,</b> the Nikon SB-E (guide number 56/17 (feet/meters) at ASA 100) {{and a very}} small power winder, the Nikon MD-E (motorized film advance at 2 frames per second). However, {{the star of the}} E-system were a new brand of lenses - the Nikon Series E lenses (discontinued circa 1987). The Series E lens line up in 1980 were a 28 mm f/2.8 wide angle, a 35 mm f/2.5 semi-wide angle, a 50 mm f/1.8 normal, a 100 mm f/2.8 short telephoto and a 75-150 mm f/3.5 zoom, with the subsequent addition of a 70-210 mm f/4 zoom, and a 135 mm f/2.8 medium telephoto. These lenses were intended to enhance the EMâ€™s appeal with new users, by being inexpensive but good quality alternatives to the pricey regular Nikkor branded lenses.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityA {{laboratory}} test system {{was set up}} to permit the introduction of image degrading factors (haze, vibration, etc.) encountered in aerial photography. This thesis describes the test equipment, procedure and results of each phase, and sets forth some general conclusions {{in the form of a}} table of image defects with their possible causes. From the many factors which may affect the image in an aerial negative, several of the more common were chosen for study. These included haze, windows, focus, translatory image motion, vibration, obstruction in the image-forming rays, and variations of exposure and development. The tests conducted were generally of a qualitative nature. The test system consisted of an <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> <b>unit</b> with opal diffuser, a positive transparency target, a collimator, a 24 -inch f/ 6 lens, and a focusing-back magazine with vacuum. After determining optimum focus and establishing processing techniques, a negative from the system was obtained to be used as a standard throughout the series of tests. The factors mentioned previously were then introduced into the system one at a time and the resulting negatives compared with the standard. The similarity of many of the effects emphasized the importance of careful analyses of aerial negatives. The advantage of a short exposure time was probably the most outstanding observation made. Although this is not a newly observed fact, the 50 microsecond exposure of the <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> <b>unit</b> did emphasize that vibration and other forms of image motion would assume roles of lesser importance if equipment and photosensitive material would permit exposures of shorter duration. After the tests were completed and summarized, it was concluded that the {{laboratory test}} method, in the majority of cases, is a reasonable approach to the study of image degrading factors...|$|E
50|$|Some <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> <b>units</b> {{can send}} out several short bursts {{of light to}} aid the {{autofocus}} system or for wireless communication with off-camera <b>flash</b> <b>units.</b> A pre-flash {{is often used to}} determine the amount of light that is reflected from the subject, which sets the duration of the main flash at time of exposure. Some cameras also employ automatic fill-flash, where the flash light and the available light are balanced. While these capabilities are not unique to the SLR, manufacturers included them early on in the top models, whereas the best rangefinder cameras adopted such features later.|$|R
50|$|Most {{shutters}} have a flash synchronization {{switch to}} trigger a flash, if connected. This was quite a complicated matter with mechanical shutters and flashbulbs which took an appreciable time to reach full brightness, focal-plane shutters making this even more difficult. Special flashbulbs were designed which had a prolonged burn, illuminating the scene for the whole time taken by a focal plane shutter slit to move across the film. These problems were essentially solved for non-focal-plane shutters {{with the advent of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> <b>units</b> which fire virtually instantaneously and emit a very short flash.|$|R
5000|$|All four Stroboflash models {{consisted}} of a power pack that connected to a separate flash head via a power cord and special plug and all used the same Stroboflash flash heads, which were light weight and had a satin reflector that produced very soft, non directional light. Professional photographers used Stroboflash II and IV <b>electronic</b> <b>flashes</b> extensively in the 50's through 80's because of the soft, well diffused light they produce. The Stroboflash <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> <b>units</b> are still considered flashes that produce excellent quality high power lighting, but the battery expense {{and the fact that}} the batteries only produce between 1,000 to 2,000 flashes (depending on the power level selected) {{and the fact that the}}se flash batteries were not rechargeable led to professionals replacing these flashes with other models that were powered by batteries that could be recharged.|$|R
40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for detecting human eye defects, particularly detection of refractive error is presented. Eye reflex is recorded on color film when {{the eyes are}} exposed to a flash of light. The photographs are compared with predetermined standards to detect eye defects. The base structure of the ocular screening system is a folding interconnect structure, comprising hinged sections. Attached to {{one end of the}} structure is a head positioning station which comprises vertical support, a head positioning bracket having one end attached {{to the top of the}} support, and two head positioning lamps to verify precise head positioning. At the opposite end of the interconnect structure is a camera station with camera, <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> <b>unit,</b> and blinking fixation lamp, for photographing the eyes of persons being evaluated...|$|E
40|$|THE recent {{publication}} of stereoscopic manuals of fundus photography (Blodi and Allen, 1964; Hoyt and Beeston, 1966) has demonstrated the great potentials {{of this form}} of investi-gation. A stereoscopic photograph {{is not only an}} excellent medium for teaching, but is also of great diagnostic value in presenting a magnified three-dimensional image of the fundus, which may be examined in detail at leisure and compared readily with the ophthalmoscopic appearance or correlated with the fluorescein angiogram. In addition, it can provide an objective record of the progress of ocular lesions which are themselves three-dimensional in nature. An instrument is described that has been designed to be used in conjunction with a fundus camera to take stereoscopic photographs. Although the history of stereoscopic fundus photography dates back to the work of Thorner (1909), it is only recently that advances in photographic equipment, in particular the electronic power-pack, have made this form of photography more practicable. It is conceded that the only truly quantitative method of stereophotography entails the use of simultaneous exposures, but to produce a suitable fundus camera to give simultaneous exposures is technically difficult; although such cameras do exist (Norton, 1955; Donaldson, 1965), they are very expensive and, being in a limited field of photography, are at present beyond the range of most photographic units. Stereoscopic photographs can be obtained more easily though less accurately by taking successive photographs and altering the optical axis of the camera between exposures. This dual-exposure method, known as relative stereophotography, has been made possible by the advent of the rapidly recharging <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> <b>unit</b> which reduces the time between exposures; the pictures obtained by this method give a qualitative stereoscopic effect although their quantitative value is variable. Several different methods for altering the optical axis of the camera have been devised; these include rotating the camera (Stenstrom, 1960) moving it laterally (Allen, 1964), moving the patient's fixation (Norton and Sullivan, 1958), and altering the direction of the optical system by an image-separating device (Allen, Kirkendall, Snyder, and Frazier...|$|E
50|$|Until the 1960s, studio flash {{systems were}} large and cumbersome, {{requiring}} bulky power generators {{to power the}} flash heads, connected by large cables. In 1963, Bowens invented the first <b>electronic</b> studio <b>flash</b> <b>unit</b> with its power source built into it. This became known as a monobloc (sometimes Monolite) which is now an industry standard tool.|$|R
50|$|In 1937 Edgerton began {{a lifelong}} {{association}} with photographer Gjon Mili, who used stroboscopic equipment, in particular, multiple studio <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> <b>units,</b> to produce strikingly beautiful photographs, {{many of which}} appeared in Life Magazine. When taking multiflash photographs this strobe light equipment could flash up to 120 times a second. Edgerton was a pioneer in using short duration <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> in photographing fast events photography, subsequently using the technique to capture images of balloons {{at different stages of}} their bursting, a bullet during its impact with an apple, or using multiflash to track the motion of a devil stick, for example. He was awarded a bronze medal by the Royal Photographic Society in 1934, the Howard N. Potts Medal from the Franklin Institute in 1941, the David Richardson Medal by the Optical Society of America in 1968, the Albert A. Michelson Medal from the same Franklin Institute in 1969, and the National Medal of Science in 1973.|$|R
50|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>flash</b> <b>units</b> have {{compatibility}} {{issues with}} focal-plane shutters. Focal-plane shutters expose using two curtains that cross the sensor. The first one opens {{and the second}} curtain follows it after a delay equal to the nominal shutter speed. A typical modern focal-plane shutter takes about 1/200 s to cross the sensor, so at exposure times shorter than this {{only part of the}} sensor is uncovered at any one time. <b>Electronic</b> <b>flash</b> can have durations as short as 50 Âµs, so at such short exposure times only part of the sensor is exposed. This limits the shutter speed to about 1/200 s when using flash. In the past, slow-burning single-use flash bulbs allowed the use of focal-plane shutters at maximum speed because they produced continuous light for the time taken for the exposing slit to cross the film gate. If these are found they cannot be used on modern cameras because the bulb must be fired *before* the first shutter curtain begins to move (M-sync); the X-sync used for <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> normally fires only when the first shutter curtain reaches the end of its travel.|$|R
50|$|From {{the late}} 1980s {{competition}} and technical innovations made 35 mm camera systems more versatile and sophisticated by adding more advanced light metering capabilities such as spot-metering; limited area metering such as used by Canon with the F1 series; matrix metering as used by Nikon, exposure communication with dedicated <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> <b>units.</b> The user interface also changed on many cameras, replacing meter needle displays that were galvanometer-based and thereby fragile, with light-emitting diodes (LEDs) {{and then with}} more comprehensive liquid crystal displays (LCDs) both in the SLR viewfinder and externally on the cameras' top plate using an LCD screen. Wheels and buttons replaced the shutter dial on the camera and the aperture ring on the lens on many models, although some photographers still prefer shutter dials and aperture rings. Some manufacturers introduced image stabilization on certain lenses to combat camera shake and to allow longer hand-held exposures without using a tripod. This feature is especially useful with long telephoto lenses.|$|R
50|$|The {{expense of}} color film as {{compared}} to black-and-white {{and the difficulty of}} using it with indoor lighting combined to delay its widespread adoption by amateurs. In 1950, black-and-white snapshots were still the norm. By 1960, color was much more common but still tended to be reserved for travel photos and special occasions. Color film and color prints still cost several times as much as black-and-white, and taking color snapshots in deep shade or indoors required the use of flash bulbs, an inconvenience and an additional expense. By 1970, prices were coming down, film sensitivity had been improved, <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> <b>units</b> were replacing <b>flash</b> bulbs, and in most families color had become the norm for snapshot-taking. Black-and-white film continued to be used by some photographers who preferred it for aesthetic reasons or who wanted to take pictures by existing light in low-light conditions, which was still difficult to do with color film. They usually did their own developing and printing. By 1980, black-and-white film in the formats used by typical snapshot cameras, as well as commercial developing and printing service for it, had nearly disappeared.|$|R

50|$|Another {{suitable}} {{source is}} <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> {{which can be}} used efficiently in combination with an aluminium reflector.

50|$|The Rollei Strobomatic E66 costing 548 DM was {{the first}} <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> on the market, but not for long.

In 1968, Rollei introduced <b>flash</b> <b>units</b> for studio photography; there were three models (E250, E1250 and E5000), each with a different flash head. A special feature of Rollei's studio <b>flash</b> <b>units</b> was a modeling light - a halogen lamp integrated into the flash head. This helped the photographer to adjust the lighting and select the most appropriate aperture.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1976, Nippon Kogaku {{introduced}} the Nikon Speedlight SB-2 (guide number 82/25 (feet/meters) at ASA 100), SB-5 (guide number 105/32 (feet/meters) at ASA 100), SB-6 (guide number 148/45 (feet/meters) at ASA 100) and SB-7E (guide number 82/25 (feet/meters) at ASA 100) <b>electronic</b> <b>flashes.</b> Note that the F2 {{did not use}} a standard ISO hot shoe to mount <b>flash</b> <b>units.</b> Instead, the SB-2, -6 and -7E mounted in a unique-to-Nikon-F-and-F2 hot shoe surrounding the film rewind crank. Manually rewinding film could not be done with a flash mounted in this shoe because the flash blocked the crank. Standard ISO foot flashes can {{be connected to the}} Nikon shoe via the Nikon AS-1 <b>Flash</b> <b>Unit</b> Coupler.|$|R
50|$|Unlike flashbulbs, the {{intensity}} of an <b>electronic</b> <b>flash</b> can be adjusted on some units. To do this, smaller <b>flash</b> <b>units</b> typically vary the capacitor discharge time, whereas larger (e.g., higher power, studio) units typically vary the capacitor charge. Color temperature can change {{as a result of}} varying the capacitor charge, thus making color corrections necessary. Due to advances in semiconductor technology, some studio units can now control intensity by varying the discharge time and thereby provide consistent color temperature.|$|R
50|$|Bowens {{manufacture}} {{lighting equipment}} for photographers. The first <b>flash</b> bulb <b>units</b> were produced in 1947 and in 1950 the company started to produce its first <b>electronic</b> studio <b>flash</b> systems.|$|R
50|$|Mounted on the {{secondary}} mirror {{itself was a}} single cell for selective measurement and in the camera base was a five segment cell for integrated measurement with multi-pattern measurement.

5000|$|The FT {{also had}} two PC {{terminals}} to synchronize with flash units: an M-sync to all speeds for M and FP type (1/60 second for MF type) flashbulbs and an X-sync to 1/125th second for <b>electronic</b> <b>flashes</b> using guide number manual exposure control. However, the FT {{did not have}} a built-in accessory shoe to mount <b>flash</b> <b>units.</b> The [...] "Nikkormat accessory shoe" [...] must be screwed {{to the top of the}} pentaprism cover via the eyepiece first.
