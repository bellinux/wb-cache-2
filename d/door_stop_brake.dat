40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{analysis}} induction motors. There are described their principle {{and methods of}} starting, the engine controls and the <b>stop</b> <b>braking.</b> In terms of this study it was determined the engine controls type for control unit for church bell electric drive design. In next part there is complete hardware and software design of control unit...|$|R
50|$|Systems {{used for}} many mission {{critical}} applications must be real-time, such as {{for control of}} fly-by-wire aircraft, or anti-lock brakes on a vehicle, which must produce maximum deceleration but intermittently <b>stop</b> <b>braking</b> to prevent skidding. Real-time processing fails if not completed within a specified deadline relative to an event; deadlines must always be met, regardless of system load.|$|R
50|$|Wedges {{can also}} be used to hold objects in place, such as engine parts (poppet valves), bicycle parts (stems and {{eccentric}} bottom brackets), and doors. A wedge-type <b>door</b> <b>stop</b> (<b>door</b> wedge) functions largely because of the friction generated between the bottom of the door and the wedge, and the wedge and the floor (or other surface).|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{thermomechanical}} cracking of railway wheel treads is studied by full-scale brake rig tests and finite element simulations. The main {{goal of the}} paper is to perform thermomechanical rolling contact fatigue life predictions. The wheel tread material is subjected to simultaneous mechanical and thermal loads due to rolling contact and <b>stop</b> <b>braking,</b> respectively. Full-scale tests featuring three series of repeated <b>stop</b> <b>braking</b> cases have been performed in a brake rig featuring a tread braked wheel that is in rolling contact with a so-called rail-wheel. The brake rig test conditions have been simulated numerically using the finite element method where the effect of “hot bands” on the tread is accounted for {{as indicated by the}} experimental findings. Stresses induced by temperature from braking as well as tractive rolling contact loading on the tread are considered. The mechanical response of the wheel material ER 7 is obtained from a plastic Chaboche material model calibrated against data from cyclic experiments at room temperature and up to 625 °C. Finally, a strategy for prediction of fatigue life with respect to ratchetting failure is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{cracking}} of {{railway wheel}} treads is investigated using a combined experimental and numerical approach. Results from controlled brake rig tests of repeated <b>stop</b> <b>braking</b> cycles for a railway wheel in rolling {{contact with a}} so-called railwheel are presented. Test conditions are then numerically analysed using finite element (FE) simulations that account for the thermomechanical loading of the wheel tread. For the studied <b>stop</b> <b>braking</b> case, thermal cracks {{are found in the}} wheel tread after few brake cycles. Results from thermal imaging reveal a frictionally excited thermoelastic instability phenomenon called "banding" where the contact between brake block and wheel occurs only over a fraction of the block width. This condition results in locally high temperatures. The numerical analysis assesses ratcheting response of the wheel tread material under operational conditions corresponding to two types of banding patterns and also a case of uniform heating. Fatigue life predictions are estimated from the evaluated ratcheting response using a simplified accumulation rule. Predicted lives are found to be in reasonable agreement with experimental results...|$|R
6000|$|She {{repeated}} the question. For once Fortune favored us. A timely {{knock at the}} <b>door</b> <b>stopped</b> her {{just as she was}} trying to release herself from me. [...] "Somebody coming in," [...] I said. The servant entered, as I spoke, with a letter from the rectory.|$|R
60|$|He {{went to the}} <b>door,</b> <b>stopped,</b> {{opened his}} lips as if to speak, said nothing, and moved on. He passed through the wicket, and mounted his horse. In a second he had flung himself from his saddle again, {{transferred}} the reins to Murgatroyd, and re-entered the cottage.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, thermal {{cracking}} of railway wheel treads is studied by full-scale brake rig tests and finite element simulations. The {{focus is on}} thermomechanical rolling contact fatigue (RCF) life predictions. The wheel tread material is subjected to simultaneous mechanical and thermal loads due to rolling contact and <b>stop</b> <b>braking,</b> respectively. Full-scale tests featuring three series of repeated <b>stop</b> <b>braking</b> cases have been performed at the Railway Technical Research Institute (RTRI) in Japan in a brake rig featuring a tread braked wheel that is in rolling contact with a railwheel. The brake rig test conditions have been simulated numerically using the finite element method. To this end, the effect of “hot bands” on the tread is accounted for {{as indicated by the}} experimental findings. Thermomechanical stresses induced by braking as well as Hertzian contact loading on the tread including tractive loads based on a partial slip assumption are considered. The mechanical response of the wheel material ER 7 is obtained from a viscoplastic Chaboche material model calibrated against data from cyclic experiments with hold-time from room temperatures up to 650 °C. Finally, a strategy for prediction of fatigue life with respect to ratcheting failure is discussed...|$|R

2500|$|Doorstops {{are simple}} devices {{used to prevent}} a door from coming into contact with another object (typically a wall). [...] Without the <b>door</b> <b>stop</b> damage might be done to the wall. They may either absorb {{the force of a}} moving door, or hold the door in place to prevent {{unintended}} motion.|$|R
50|$|Vehicles are {{equipped}} {{with a variety of}} lights and reflectors to mark their presence, position, width, length, and direction of travel as well as to convey the driver's intent and actions to other drivers. These include the vehicle's headlamps, front and rear position lamps, side marker lights and reflectors, turn signals, <b>stop</b> (<b>brake)</b> lamps, and reversing lamps. School buses and Semi-trailer trucks in North America are required to bear retroreflective strips outlining their side and rear perimeters for greater conspicuity at night.|$|R
5000|$|It {{functions}} {{using two}} parallel [...] tracks, {{each with its}} own tram and central rack, laid on wooden sleepers over stone ballast. The trams are connected along a 7 m long, 2 m wide steel cable, over a 4.5 m wheelbase. The suspension system is made of four helical without dampers and hinged spiral-spring <b>stop</b> <b>brakes.</b> Each tram supports a capacity of seat 30 passengers, with the total capacity of 38 possible across six bunks (that sat five passengers), eight standing and conductor.|$|R

50|$|A {{doorstop}} (also <b>door</b> stopper, <b>door</b> <b>stop</b> or <b>door</b> wedge) is {{an object}} or device {{used to hold}} a door open or closed, or to prevent a door from opening too widely. Alternatively, a doorstop can be a thin slat built inside a door frame to prevent a door from swinging through when closed. A doorstop (applied) {{may also be a}} small bracket or 90 degree piece of metal applied to the frame of a <b>door</b> to <b>stop</b> the <b>door</b> from swinging (bi-directional) and converting that door to a single direction (in-swing push or out-swing pull).|$|R

[...] He caught my hand before I was aware of him, and wrung it hard--then turned to the <b>door,</b> <b>stopped,</b> {{and came back to}} me again.|$|R
50|$|On {{machines}} with manually swung doors, one trivial yet important detail is a <b>door</b> <b>stop</b> to prevent banging when opening. If a large autoclave is installed on a slightly off level floor, then the door, once opened, swings rapidly {{to the end}} of its travel. With no snubber of any sort installed, it will slowly accumulate damage and wear.|$|R

50|$|The {{reason for}} the by far bigger jerk in the first way to brake is a {{discontinuity}} of the acceleration, which is initially at a constant value, due to the constant force on the pedal, and drops to zero immediately, when the wheels stop rotating. Note {{that there would be}} no jerk if the car started to move backwards with the same acceleration. Every experienced driver knows how to start and how to <b>stop</b> <b>braking</b> with low jerk. See also below in the motion profile, segment 7: Deceleration ramp-down.|$|R

40|$|The {{temperature}} rise of wheels and blocks due to frictional heating during railway tread braking {{along with the}} transfer of heat through the wheel–rail contact is studied in this paper. In particular, heat partitioning between block, wheel and rail for <b>stop</b> <b>braking</b> cycles is considered. The wheels are of interest because they are a limiting factor for railway tread braking systems. Two types of thermal models are employed to investigate the maximum temperatures over the wheel tread. In a circumferential (plane) model of wheel, block and rail, the heat transfer problem is studied by use of a finite element formulation of the two-dimensional time-dependent convection–diffusion equation. The hot spot phenomenon is simulated by introducing a prescribed wheel-fixed contact pressure distribution between wheel and block. In an axisymmetric (axial) model of wheel, block and rail, the lateral movements of the wheel–rail contact are studied. A general {{result is that the}} cooling effect provided by the rail is important when local temperatures on the tread are considered, but not when studying bulk temperatures created in a single <b>stop</b> <b>braking</b> event. Furthermore, it is found from the lateral movements of the wheel–rail contact that slow oscillations result in maximum temperatures over the wheel tread that are somewhat lower than for travelling on straight track (rolling at the rolling circle) ...|$|R

Lever arms (with brake pads) actuated by spring-powered, pneumatic cylinders connected to these arms. Springs give specific spring-loading constant and exert predetermined load onto brake pads through lever arms. Pneumatic cylinders actuated positively to compress springs and disengage brake pads from disks. During power failure, brakes automatically lock onto disks, producing highly reliable, fail-safe stops. System doubles as <b>stopping</b> <b>brake</b> and "parking" brake...|$|R
