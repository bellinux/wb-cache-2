40|$|Graham’s {{ratio is}} a {{commonly}} used indicator {{for measuring the}} intensity of the oxidation of coal in underground mine atmospheres. Successful measurement of <b>oxygen</b> <b>deficiency</b> is critical in order to generate relevant results, as well as meaningful data trends. Graham’s ratio is often used as a trigger for Trigger Action Response Plans (TARP) for the management of spontaneous combustion. If a Graham’s ratio is calculated where there is an insufficient <b>oxygen</b> <b>deficiency</b> the result can be overestimated and trigger a TARP level. Mitchell (1996) and the NSW Mines Rescue gas detection and emergency preparedness book (2014) has previously identified issues with using Graham’s Ratio when the <b>oxygen</b> <b>deficiency</b> is less than 0. 3 %, due to analytical limitations. This issue is often encountered in samples in which the composition is close to air due to the low inherent <b>oxygen</b> <b>deficiency</b> of the sample. The same problem is identified in samples diluted with seam gas. Errors in <b>oxygen</b> <b>deficiency</b> can be compounded by inaccuracies in other measured components when nitrogen is calculated by difference. A concern with applying the 0. 3 % <b>oxygen</b> <b>deficiency</b> requirement (minimum limit) to dilute or close to air samples is that valid data may be excluded from interpretation. This paper will review the magnitude and application of minimum <b>oxygen</b> <b>deficiency</b> required for a consistent valid measurement of Graham’s ratio. This will be done across a range of samples using real data from a number of modern analysis techniques in underground coal mines...|$|R

40|$|<b>Oxygen</b> <b>deficiency</b> is {{a common}} {{stimulus}} during life. To prevent the development of hypoxia on the tissue level, organisms counteract <b>oxygen</b> <b>deficiency</b> using various mechanisms of adaptation. In this thesis, {{the influence of a}} reduced oxygen content in the incubation air on the chick embryo was examined. The embryos passed through a chronic oxygen defciency (15 % O 2) from D 6 to 12 (critical window) and an additional acute anoxic period on D 18. In addition, one group was incubated exposed to a combination of hypoxia (15 % O 2) and Hyperthermia (40 °C) for 24 h on D 10. The gene expression levels of hypoxia inducible genes (AMPK, Enolase, PFK, VEGF) were determined using real-time PCR for detection of messenger RNA in embryonic heart tissue. Furthermore, the masses of the embryo and its heart were acquired. Interpretation of the PCR data showed an age dependent increase of hypoxia inducible gene expression due to an increasing oxygen demand during embryonic development and a constant oxygen supply. Incubation under chronic (D 6 - 12) mild (15 % O 2) hypoxia caused no increase in gene expression of the tested genes. Incubation under acute (30 - 45 Minutes) anoxia on D 18 also had no effect on the expression levels of the genes examined in heart tissue. Only the combination of hypoxia and hyperthermia on D 10 resulted in an increased expression of the examined hypoxia inducible genes. The embryonic body and heart mass was unchanged under chronic and acute hypoxia. These results suggest that other regulative mechanisms than increased gene expression of hypoxia inducible genes are most relevant during hypoxia. Such adaptive mechanisms conserve the energy content of heart tissue and prevent a delay in mass development during <b>oxygen</b> <b>deficiency.</b> Only the combination Hyperthermia and Hypoxia makes an increase of gene expression indispensable. The hypoxia induced hypometabolism is an adaptive mechanism which reduces the energy demand by down regulation of metabolism during <b>oxygen</b> <b>deficiency.</b> Particularly a decrease of membrane permeability lowers the level of energy consumption. Mild hypoxia and physiologic temperature leads to an active decrease of metabolism and survival without intracellular <b>oxygen</b> <b>deficiency.</b> In contrast, hyperthermia stimulates the metabolism and consequently increases the level of energy consumption. Therefore, increased gene expression is required to adapt to a combination of hypoxia and hyperthermia. The hypoxia-induced hypometabolism seems to anticipate the gene regulative reaction during mild hypoxia.
