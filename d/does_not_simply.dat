5|$|In 1958, Daniel Koshland {{suggested}} a modification to {{the lock and}} key model: since enzymes are rather flexible structures, the active site is continuously reshaped by interactions with the substrate as the substrate interacts with the enzyme. As a result, the substrate <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> bind to a rigid active site; the amino acid side-chains {{that make up the}} active site are molded into the precise positions that enable the enzyme to perform its catalytic function. In some cases, such as glycosidases, the substrate molecule also changes shape slightly as it enters the active site. The active site continues to change until the substrate is completely bound, at which point the final shape and charge distribution is determined.|$|E
5|$|Luther lists several criticisms {{advanced}} by laypeople against indulgences in theses 81–91. He presents these as difficult objections his congregants are bringing {{rather than his}} own criticisms. How should he answer those who ask why the pope <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> empty purgatory {{if it is in}} his power? What should he say to those who ask why anniversary masses for the dead, which were for the sake of those in purgatory, continued for those who had been redeemed by an indulgence? Luther claimed that it seemed strange to some that pious people in purgatory could be redeemed by living impious people. Luther also mentions the question of why the pope, who is very rich, requires money from poor believers to build St. Peter's Basilica. Luther claims that ignoring these questions risks allowing people to ridicule the pope. He appeals to the pope's financial interest, saying that if the preachers limited their preaching in accordance with Luther's positions on indulgences (which he claimed was also the pope's position), the objections would cease to be relevant. Luther closes the Theses by exhorting Christians to imitate Christ even if it brings pain and suffering. Enduring punishment and entering heaven is preferable to false security.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the episode, {{dialogue}} and objects prompt Lily {{to recall the}} events of her own first arrest. During flashbacks, a seventeen-year-old Lily Rhodes (Brittany Snow), having deliberately gotten expelled from The Thacher School in Ojai, California travels to Malibu, California to meet with her father, Rick Rhodes (Andrew McCarthy), the wealthy owner of Rhodes Records. Sadly for Lily, Rick already phoned her mother CeCe, who drove to Malibu from Montecito to deal with Lily. When Rick rejects the idea of Lily living with him in Malibu, Lily decides to find her sister Carol (Krysten Ritter) rather than move in with CeCe, whom Lily detests. Carol, an aspiring actress, had rejected the Rhode’s upscale life and moved a year earlier to the San Fernando Valley. While searching for Carol, Lily meets Owen Campos (Shiloh Fernandez), who takes her to a club where they find Shep, Owen’s musician friend, and Carol. Carol and Shep {{are in the midst}} of a dispute with Keith van der Woodsen (Matt Barr), the rich, antagonistic director of Shep’s music video in which Carol stars, and are headed to his party to confront him for raising his price and holding the video hostage. When Lily asks why Carol <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> use their father’s company, Carol insists she does not want anyone to know of their privileged background. When the antagonism escalates to a fight at the party, security arrests Owen and Lily although Carol and Shep manage to escape. From jail, Lily calls CeCe. CeCe calls her daughters irresponsible. Carol, who has come to pay Lily’s bail, overhears Lily defend Carol's lifestyle. Carol takes the phone from Lily, informs CeCe that Lily will be moving in with her, and takes Lily back to the city.|$|E

He prepares meticulously by researching his quarry at the British Museum library; he obtains papers for his various false identities; he travels around Paris to find a good location for a sniper's nest; he buys and tests his weapons; and so on.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s Bradbury adapted his book into a play.

The stage adaptation diverges considerably from the book and seems influenced by Truffaut's movie. For example, fire chief Beatty's character is fleshed out and is the wordiest role in the play. As in the movie, Clarisse <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> disappear but in the finale meets up with Montag as a book character (she as Robert Louis Stevenson, he as Edgar Allan Poe).|$|E
25|$|Laser vitreolysis is a {{possible}} treatment option {{for the removal of}} vitreous strands and opacities (floaters). In this procedure an ophthalmic laser (usually a yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) laser) applies a series of nanosecond pulses of low-energy laser light to evaporate the vitreous opacities and to sever the vitreous strands. During this process, the laser energy evaporates the collagen and hyaluronin molecules to form a gas. (It {{is important to note that}} the laser energy applied during vitreolysis treatment <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> break the floater into smaller pieces. Instead, the laser energy converts the floater material to a gas, which is then absorbed into the eye.) The end result is that the floater is removed and/or reduced to a size that no longer impedes vision.|$|E

25|$|Olsen used Hofstaðir as a {{particularly}} {{good example of the}} idea of the temple-farm. Despite its large size, in form the building is identical to other longhouses, the small room at the north end was a later addition, and the 1908 excavation had not fully revealed the entrances, annexes, and ancillary buildings. He considered it primarily a farmhouse and only incidentally a hof. However, in addition to clarifying the relationship between the annexes and the main hall, the re-excavation revealed even more bone fragments, and analysis shows that at least 23 cattle had been sacrificial offerings. They were killed in an unusual manner, by a blow between the eyes, and their skulls displayed outside for years. The horns had not been removed and in age the animals ranged from just full-grown to middle-aged, both of these being unique in Icelandic farming at the time; also the majority appear to have been bulls, which is very surprising in a dairy economy. The dates of the skulls varied, with the last having been slaughtered around 1000 C.E., and one sheep skeleton was found that had been killed {{in the same manner as}} the cattle. The bone finds thus indicate the building did indeed serve as a hof. So do the surprisingly small size of the main hearth despite the great size of the building; the relatively few finds of valuable objects (and complete lack of weapons), and the location, which is convenient for travel and highly visible, but not good for a farmstead. Hence, the unusual evidence of frequent meat feasting <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> indicate {{a particularly}} wealthy settlement, but a place of frequent ritual gatherings, probably in spring and summer. The unusual method of slaughter was deliberately dramatic and would have produced a fountain of blood. The skulls were found among roof and wall debris, all but one grouped in two places at the south end of the hall: inside the southeast annex and between the southwestern annex and the wall of the main building; it seems plausible that they were on display when the building was in use and that where they were found was storage, whether normal winter storage or concealment after conversion to Christianity caused the abandonment of the building in the mid-eleventh century. The goat sacrifice can be interpreted as a termination ritual.|$|E
500|$|Time {{magazine}} called the film [...] "fast, smart, shrewdly directed and capably performed" [...] and commented {{extensively on the}} film's humour, saying [...] "Director Young {{is a master of}} the form he ridicules, and in almost every episode he hands the audience shocks as well as yocks. But the yocks are more memorable. They result from slight but sly infractions of the thriller formula. A Russian agent, for instance, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> escape through a window; no, he escapes through a window in a brick wall painted with a colossal poster portrait of Anita Ekberg, and as he crawls out of the window, he seems to be crawling out of Anita's mouth. Or again, Bond <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> train a telescope on the Russian consulate and hope he can read somebody's lips; no, he makes his way laboriously into a gallery beneath the joint, runs a submarine periscope up through the walls, and there, at close range, inspects two important Soviet secrets: the heroine's legs." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} nineteenth century, lyric poetry was {{associated}} with male poets and quotidian poetry (i.e., the poetry of the everyday) with female poets. The division of labour in Midas reflects this trend: Percy contributed the two lyric poems in the drama while Mary's play contains the kind of detail found in the poetry of other women. However, Mary Shelley <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> accept these gender-genre distinctions. As Richardson explains, [...] "soliloquy is resisted in the first act and exposed in the second act as a questionable and implicitly masculine mode". Furthermore, the disjunction between Percy Shelley's poems, spoken by Apollo and Pan in the first act, and Mary Shelley's verse drama has often bothered critics. Yet, Richardson argues that this was intended, to highlight the difference in poetic mode.|$|E
500|$|... "Barbette," [...] writes Cocteau, [...] "transforms {{effortlessly}} {{back and}} forth between man and woman.

That blindness is so complete {{that at the end of}} his act, Barbette <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> remove his wig but instead plays the part of a man. He rolls his shoulders, stretches his hands, swells his muscles...And after the fifteenth or so curtain call, he gives a mischievous wink, shifts from foot to foot, mimes a bit of an apology, and does a shuffling little street urchin dance – all of it to erase the fabulous, dying-swan impression left by the act."

Its tendency toward third-person narration and portraying characters through direct speech and action became hallmarks of Chinese narrative in general, and its style was imitated by historians, storytellers, and ancient style prose masters for over 2000 years of subsequent Chinese history.|$|E
500|$|Genre {{conventions}} are satirized and mocked {{throughout the}} film. In American noirs, heroes, or anti-heroes, typically {{strive to be}} the best in their field. Here the process was formalized into a rankings system obsessed over by its players. The femme fatale—a noir staple—Misako, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>simply</b> entice the protagonist and bring the threat of death but obsesses him and is obsessed with all things death herself. She tries to kill him, wants to kill herself and surrounds herself with dead things. Hanada's libido is as present as that of the protagonists of similar films of the period, such as James Bond, though perversely exaggerated. Reviewer Rumsey Taylor likened Hanada's boiled rice sniffing fetish to Bond's [...] "shaken, not stirred" [...] martini order. The film also deviates from the opening killer-for-hire scenario to touch on such varied subgenres as psychosexual romance, American Gothic thriller and Odd Couple slapstick.|$|E
500|$|Gregory, however, {{also says}} that he thinks that Ingoberg was seventy years old in 589; and this would make her about forty when she married Charibert. This is possible, but seems unlikely, {{especially}} as Charibert {{seems to have had}} a preference for younger women, again according to Gregory's account. This would imply an earlier birth date for Bertha. On the other hand, Gregory refers to Æthelberht {{at the time of his}} marriage to Bertha simply as [...] "a man of Kent", and in the 589 passage concerning Ingoberg's death, which was written in about 590 or 591, he refers to Æthelberht as [...] "the son of the king of Kent".
