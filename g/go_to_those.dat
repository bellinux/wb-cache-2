25|$|Smith, {{although}} {{running for}} his campaign, {{would refuse to}} leave without beginning the skeleton of a new park and parkway system for Long Island {{and make sure the}} land needed would be in property of the state. Smith continued ripping the politicians and that they were on the side of those in Wheatley Hills and pledged to keep the parkway out of their neighborhood. However, Smith argued that the sentiment had changed in Wheatley Hills and that most of the residents were in support of the project. However, Hewitt and Hutchinson refused to permit the money because they would not touch any money until the Southern State Parkway was completed. Smith denied that agreement ever occurred. The money {{that was supposed to be}} use was from unappropriated state land in New York City. The money for purchasing land would <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> who agreed with the LISPC on prices or those who could not afford to give away the land.|$|E
25|$|Admiral Zheng He is {{explicitly}} {{mentioned in the}} Mingshi in connection to the visits of Ganbali (possibly Coimatore), Lasa, Djorfar, Magadishu, and Brava. Ganbali is in southern India, Lasa and Djorfar is on the southern coast of Arabia, and Magadishu and Brava is in Somalia (Africa). Dreyer (2007) states that the account is unclear on whether he did <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> places in person. The wording in the Mingshi could indicate that he did as the account stated that he proclaimed imperial instructions to the kings of these countries. Although, this may as well not be the case, because the fleet only made short stops at Calicut (4 days outward and 9 days homeward) {{that could not have}} provided enough time to travel overland to Ganbali, unless the location did not refer to Coimatore but elsewhere in southern India. The overland journey may have been undertaken by someone else than Zheng He himself. The Mingshi account about Lasa states that ambassadors from Lasa, Aden, and Brava traveled with Zheng He to China. This meant that the ships carrying them had possibly reassembled with the main fleet in Calicut according to Dreyer (2007), depending on whether Zheng He visited these countries in person or remained with the main portion of the fleet. Dreyer (2007) thinks that the detached squadrons had probably already assembled at Calicut for its homeward journey, because the main fleet didn't stay there for long.|$|E

Launching the review at an address to party delegates in Edinburgh, she questioned whether services such as prescriptions and tuition feeswhich are free in Scotlandshould continue {{to be available to}} all, regardless of income, and suggested the situation was unsustainable: [...] "I believe our resources must <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> in greatest need... Salmond's most cynical trick was to make people believe that more was free, when the poorest are paying for the tax breaks for the rich...

2500|$|In Judaism, {{one must}} <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> he has harmed {{in order to}} be {{entitled}} to forgiveness. [...] This means that in Judaism a person cannot obtain forgiveness from God for wrongs the person has done to other people. This also means that, unless the victim forgave the perpetrator before he died, murder is unforgivable in Judaism, and they will answer to God for it, though the victims' family and friends can forgive the murderer for the grief they caused them. The Tefila Zaka meditation, which is recited just before Yom Kippur, closes with the following: ...|$|E

2500|$|Institutions created {{specifically}} {{to care for}} the ill also appeared early in India. Fa Xian, a Chinese Buddhist monk who travelled across India ca. A.D. 400, recorded in his travelogue that: The heads of the Vaisya [...] families in them [...] establish in the cities houses for dispensing charity and medicine. All the poor and destitute in the country, orphans, widowers, and childless men, maimed people and cripples, and all who are diseased, <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> houses, and are provided with every kind of help, and doctors examine their diseases. They get the food and medicines which their cases require, and are made to feel at ease; and when they are better, they go away of themselves.|$|E

2500|$|Frustrated by the {{limitations}} the search had thus far encountered, and increasingly coming {{to believe that}} Ben's body was {{in an area of}} the cave no one had yet reached, the McDaniels offered a reward of $10,000, raised from money contributed at a benefit held on what would have been their son's 31st birthday, {{at the end of the}} year to anyone [...] "brave" [...] enough to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> places and find it. The insinuation of cowardice alienated divers who had already risked their lives searching the cave, and raised fears among them that it would only encourage untrained divers to enter the cave and take potentially fatal risks for the reward money. Undeterred, the McDaniels increased the award, twice.|$|E
2500|$|The miners {{who stayed}} at Vital Creek soon {{heard of a}} new strike made by Pete Toy off the Omineca River. One of the parties who decided to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>those</b> new {{diggings}} was led by an American {{by the name of}} James Germansen. While he and his group were going to the new diggings, Germansen found an undiscovered creek coming off the Omineca River. To Germansen, this unknown creek, [...] "seemed right", but his party was eager to get to Pete Toy's strike, so Germansen had to continue along with them. However when they arrived at Pete Toy's strike they encountered little success and returned to Vital Creek. But Germansen hadn't forgotten the little unnamed creek and he returned there with Duncan McMartin, James May and [...] "Blackjack" [...] Smith.|$|E

50|$|This patron-client {{system which}} causes rampant graft and {{corruption}} maintains a society that discriminates against the poor in favor of connected individuals and businesses as seen in a biased system of taxation where the well-connected benefit.
