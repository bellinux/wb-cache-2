5|$|Before all the {{steerage}} passengers {{had even}} {{a chance of}} their lives, the Titanics sailors fastened the doors and companionways leading up from the third-class section... A crowd of men {{was trying to get}} up to a higher deck and were fighting the sailors; all striking and scuffling and swearing. Women and some children were there praying and crying. Then the sailors fastened down the hatchways leading to the third-class section. They said they wanted to keep the air <b>down</b> <b>there</b> so the vessel could stay up longer. It meant all hope was gone for those still <b>down</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E
5|$|In interrogation, Wexler, {{a former}} Stasi colonel, {{explains}} to Salinger that the IBBC is practically untouchable {{because of its}} utility to terrorist organizations, drug cartels, governments, and powerful corporations of all complexions. Even if he succeeds in bringing the IBBC <b>down</b> <b>there</b> are hundreds of other banks which will replace them. If Salinger wants justice, he needs to go outside the system, and Wexler indicates a willingness to help. In Italy, Salinger tells the Calvini brothers of the IBBC's responsibility for their father's murder, prompting them to cancel the deal with the bank and have White killed.|$|E

5|$|Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King {{had invited}} Macdonald {{to run for}} federal office during the general {{election}} of 1935. Although Macdonald turned him <b>down,</b> <b>there</b> were strong rumours in 1937 that Macdonald would soon enter federal politics.

5|$|Players {{choose a}} course, a car, a {{transmission}} (automatic or six-speed manual), and a song. The cars {{vary in their}} specifications: some have a high top speed, others excel at acceleration or turning, and others present a balance. Certain cars are named after other Namco games such as Solvalou, Mappy, Bosconian, Nebulasray, and Xevious. The racetrack can be observed from the first-person perspective or, for the PlayStation version, from the third-person perspective. Namco's NeGcon controller {{can be used to}} play. Because the game is an arcade-style racing game, collisions do no damage, and merely slow the player <b>down.</b> <b>There</b> is a time limit, which ends the race if counted down to zero.|$|E

5|$|In 1903, {{the station}} {{employed}} 11 men, but {{the post of}} station master was abolished on 27 August 1909 as a cost-cutting measure, with responsibility passing to Clifton <b>Down.</b> <b>There</b> were six staff by 1938. In 1923, grouping resulted in the Midland Railway being absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), and the line continued in a joint arrangement between the Great Western and the LMS. Services to Fishponds ended on 31 March 1941. When the railways were nationalised in 1948, when it came {{under the aegis of}} the Western Region of British Railways.

The ticket office and footbridge were also demolished, with a replacement entrance opened through the South Road garages.|$|E
5|$|The {{smartphone}} considerably reduces its predecessor's sizes, measuring 4.3 by 2.4 by 6 inches (10.92, 6.09 and 15.24 centimeters, respectively). The Bold 9700 has a 624MHz {{processor and}} a 256MB Flash memory. The device uses a 2.44 inch HVGA (approximately 6.1cm) non-touch LCD display at {{a resolution of}} 480×360 pixels. The resolution of the display was {{compared to that of}} HTC Magic, as it has also HVGA quality. The model changes its predecessor's trackball to an optical trackpad, with simple functionalities such as swiping the thumb to move it and press it to make a selection. This change prevented problems including the accumulation of dust behind the trackball. Similarly to previous BlackBerry models, BlackBerry 9700 has a 35-key QWERTY-type physical keyboard, which is smaller than that of Bold 9000. On the top of the device, there are two buttons that respectively lock or mute it; {{on the right side of}} it, rubberized keys are found, which can either control the audio volume or the music player; further <b>down,</b> <b>there</b> is a camera shutter key. Cosmetic changes including the addition of a leatherette battery cover were carried out in order to appeal both sexes.|$|E

5|$|The {{storm track}} brought Mireille {{west of the}} most {{populated}} island of Honshu, limiting damage there compared to Kyushu. At Misawa Air Base, the strong winds knocked over trees and blew off the roofs of several warehouses, and also knocked off storage sheds off their foundation. Ahead of the storm, advance warning allowed the American military to shelter aircraft and warn the population. Damage was estimated between $500,000$1.5million. Two of Mazda's loading docks in Hiroshima were completely destroyed, affecting American inventories of 1992 Mazda 929's {{until the end of}} November 1991. Also in the city, 1.1million residents, or 80% of households, lost power due to winds and storm surge. In Yamaguchi Prefecture, the Takeda Pharmaceutical Company was flooded with 0.6m (2ft) of waters, forcing workers to move to another plant in the United States. The strong winds and waves damaged the Itsukushima Shrine near Hiroshima and Kenroku-en northwest of Tokyo. In Okayama Prefecture, salt spray damaged railways and shut down lines for three days. High winds in Naka-ku collapsed scaffolding from a parking garage, and another damaged scaffolding nearby forced a road to shut <b>down.</b> <b>There</b> were extensive crop losses in northern Honshu. In Toyama Prefecture, the winds destroyed 192greenhouses and exasperated a fire that caused further crop damage.|$|E
5|$|Within the {{proximity}} of Boston at the towns of Canton and Southborough, winds obliterated two factories. High winds at Grafton collapsed the railroad sheds under the ownership of the Providence and Worcester Railroad. Malden endured {{the loss of a}} mansion which was still under construction, and several smaller buildings were also blown <b>down</b> <b>there</b> and at Monson. Winds upturned trees and toppled fences at Northampton, and nearby at Palmer, a school building was crumbled into pieces by intense winds. At Springfield, winds unroofed a repair facility at a local railroad depot and a house at the town armory. Gusts destroyed railroad sheds and factories in Stoughton and Worcester as well, and at Wilmington, winds crumbled a house into pieces. Slightly to the south in Norwich, Connecticut, fallen trees obstructed railroad tracks, and at Hartford, a railroad bridge was thrown farther upstream along the Connecticut River. Further railroad damage was noted to property owned by the Winchester and Potomac, Baltimore and Ohio, and other railroads throughout the region. Nearly all key bridges managed by those railroads were washed away, with many other track segments covered in debris. In all, the hurricane caused at least 164deaths.|$|E
