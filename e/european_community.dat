5|$|The 1992 <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> Monitor Mission {{helicopter}} downing was {{an incident}} that occurred on 7 January 1992, during the Croatian War of Independence, in which a <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> Monitor Mission (ECMM) helicopter carrying five <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> (EC) observers was downed by a Yugoslav Air Force Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21, in the air space above the village of Podrute, near Novi Marof, Croatia. An Italian and a French officer and three Italian non-commissioned officers were killed. Another ECMM helicopter flying in formation with the attacked helicopter made an emergency landing. The second helicopter carried a crew and a visiting diplomat, all of whom survived. The incident was condemned by the United Nations Security Council and the EC. As {{a result of the}} incident, the Yugoslav authorities suspended the head of the air force, and the Yugoslav defense minister, General Veljko Kadijević, resigned his post. The events followed {{the end of the first}} stage of the war in Croatia and closely preceded the country's international recognition.|$|E

5|$|Humanitarian {{workers and}} foreign {{military}} observers had suspicions that the Croats deliberately abandoned Jajce, {{as well as}} territories lost in Operation Corridor 92, to the VRS {{in exchange for the}} Prevlaka Peninsula south of Dubrovnik. Even though Croatia and several Western diplomats denied this claim, <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> envoy David Owen urged the UN to impose sanctions against Croatia. The suspicion was fueled by an October 1992 agreement between Croatian President Franjo Tuđman and Yugoslav President Dobrica Ćosić to withdraw the JNA from Prevlaka. However, the JNA withdrawal from Croatian soil had also {{been a part of the}} Vance plan, which was accepted by both Croatia and Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|In November 1991 Croatia, Serbia and the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA) {{agreed upon}} the Vance plan, {{designed}} to halt combat {{operations in the}} Croatian War of Independence and allow the negotiation of a political settlement. In addition to the ceasefire, the plan protected civilians in specific areas—designated as United Nations Protected Areas (UNPAs)—and UN peacekeepers in Croatia. The ceasefire went into effect on 3 January 1992. Shortly after the Vance plan was accepted the <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> announced its decision to grant diplomatic recognition to Croatia on 15 January 1992, and the Serb- and JNA-held areas of Croatia were organised as the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK).|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of 1991, Croatia had no regular army. In an effort to bolster its defences, it doubled police personnel to about 20,000. The most effective part of the force was the 3,000-strong special police. The Croatian view of the JNA's role in the Serb revolt gradually evolved from January 1991. The initial plan of Croatian President Franjo Tuđman was to win support from the <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> (EC) and the United States for Croatia, and he disregarded advice to seize JNA barracks and storage facilities in the country. Tuđman's stance was motivated by his belief that Croatia could not win a war against the JNA.|$|E

5|$|The ECSC stood {{model for}} the {{communities}} set up after it by the Treaty of Rome in 1957, the European Economic Community and European Atomic Energy Community, with whom it shared its membership and some institutions. The 1967 Merger (Brussels) Treaty led to all of ECSC's institutions to merge into that of the European Economic Community, but the ECSC retained its own independent legal personality.

On 12 October, the Croatians suspended military action to allow the convoy to pass, but the JNA used the pause as cover to make further military gains. Once the convoy set off, the JNA delayed it for two days and used the time to lay mines, bring in reinforcements and consolidate JNA control of the road out of Vukovar. When the convoy arrived, it delivered medical supplies to Vukovar's hospital and evacuated 114 wounded civilians.|$|E
5|$|The Schuman Declaration of 9 May 1950 (later {{known as}} Europe Day) {{occurred}} after two Cabinet meetings, when the proposal became French government policy.

It laid out a plan for a <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> to pool the coal and steel of its members in a common market.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the invasion, Portugal cut {{diplomatic}} ties with Indonesia {{and went on to}} support UN resolutions condemning the invasion. However, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Portuguese government appeared reluctant to push the issue; American Indonesia specialist, Benedict Anderson suggests this stemmed from uncertainty at the time over its application to the <b>European</b> <b>Community.</b> Portugal's criticism mounted sharply from the mid-1980s, and due to public pressure, the country became one of the highest profile campaigners in international forums for East Timorese self-determination.

In 1967 the EEC's institutions took over the other two with the EEC's Commission holding its first terms under Hallstein and Rey.|$|R
5|$|The {{institutions}} of the ECSC were the High Authority, the Common Assembly, the Special Council of Ministers and the Court of Justice.

A month after the operation, the retreating paramilitary unit known as the White Eagles perpetrated the Voćin massacre, and its war crimes were prosecuted at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.|$|E
