This can easily be found in scientific literature,o - 3) where several authors already give extensive explanations about principles and theory of, for example, isotachophoresis. Some data is given of isotachophoretic separation of fruit juices.

In most of the juices at least ten more components could be visualized, but not yet determined. The detection of these components was possible by the combination of the two high resolution detectors: the UV detector and the recently developed conductometric detector. In order to show how the qualitative information can be deduced from isotachopherograms, data of nucleotides and some related components are shown, collected in four operational systems (pH 7, 6, 5, 4) ...|$|R
50|$|Hydrocolloids are {{long-chain}} polymers {{that form}} viscous dispersions and gels if dispersed in water. They {{have a number}} of functional properties in food products including emulsifying, thickening, coating, gelling, and stabilization. The main reason hydrocolloids are used in foods is their capability to modify the rheology of food systems. Hydrocolloids impact viscosity through flow behavior and mechanical solid properties like texture. Some common hydrocolloids that are used to stabilize juice products include gellan, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, xanthan, guar gum, and gum Arabic. The afore mentioned hydrocolloids are generally used in the production of imitation orange juices and are often referred to as synthetic hydrocolloids.

40|$|Summary. The {{extraction}} of fructose, glucose, galactose, sucrose and lactose from aqueous salt solutions, hydrophilic solvents (aliphatic alcohols, alkyl acetates, ketones) of double and triple mixtures has been studied. Under identical conditions set quantitative characteristics extraction has been established. It {{was found that}} from the all studied carbohydrateы most fully extracted disaccharides lactose and sucrose. The conditions of concentration and almost complete recovery of carbohydrates from aqueous salt solutions has beenoptimized. The technique of extraction-potentiometric selective determination of carbohydrates in foods and beverages has been developed. As a titrant was used isopropanol solution of boric acid. The developed method allows to determine separately the mono- or disaccharides in milk, which include those contained 5 or less carbohydrates. The complex of photocolorimetric, polarimetric, potentiometric and chromatographic methods for determining carbohydrates in aqueous media and food (diabetic confectionery, juices, dairy products, honey) wasproposed. To determine the fructose, glucose and sucrose <b>in</b> <b>natural</b> <b>juices</b> us used optical methods (photoelectrocolorimeters, polarimetry). Method is express, does not require expensive equipment and reagents. Fructose and sucrose in diabetic confectionery was determined by ascending thin layer chromatography. Some diabetic products based on fructose, produced by Russian confectionery factorieshas beenanalyzed. Duration analysis, 50 - 60 minutes, selective determination of error within 5 - 7 %. Extracts from honey and milk were analyzed potentiometrically. We have developed a technique characterized by the following advantages compared with state standards: rapidity (analysis time 30 - 35 min), accuracy (relative error within 5 %), does not require expensive equipment and reagents, as well as dilution and filtration of milk stage sampling...|$|R

In this study, other parameters such as vitamin C, antioxidant and phenolic compounds were evaluated to introduce some new and reliable indexes for safety {{assessments of}} lemon juice. Two groups of lemon juice were evaluated in the study. The two groups consisted of branded and natural products and were tested for total phenolic compounds (Folin-Ciocalteu), antioxidant capacity (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl) and ascorbic acid content (2 - 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazine). Results demonstrated that total phenolic contents in both groups showed non-significant difference but the group of <b>natural</b> lemon <b>juice</b> samples had the better antioxidant capacity (795. 61 mg VEE L - 1) and higher ascorbic acid content (187. 52 mg L - 1). Levels of antioxidant capacity ranged from 476. 60 to 1378. 12 and from 235. 47 to 888. 59 (mg VEE L - 1) <b>in</b> branded and <b>natural</b> sample groups, respectively.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to assess the total {{antioxidant}} capacity of some commercial fruit juices (namely citrus), spectrophotometrically and by the biamperometric method, using the redox couple DPPHÃ‚Â· (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl) /DPPH (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazine). TroloxÃ‚Â® was chosen as a standard antioxidant. In the case of the spectrophometric method, the absorbance decrease of the DPPHÃ‚Â· solution was followed. For the biamperometric method, the influence of some parameters like the potential diference, ÃŽÂ”E, DPPHÃ‚Â· concentration, and TroloxÃ‚Â® concentration was investigated. The calibration graph obtained for TroloxÃ‚Â® presents linearity between 5 and 30 Ã‚ÂµM, (y = 0. 059 x + 0. 0564, where y represents the value of current intensity, expressed as ÃŽÂ¼A and x the value of TroloxÃ‚Â® concentration, expressed as ÃŽÂ¼M; r 2 = 0. 9944). The R. S. D. value for the biamperometric method was 1. 29 % (n = 10, c = 15 ÃŽÂ¼M TroloxÃ‚Â®). In the case of the spectrophotometric method, the calibration graph obtained for TroloxÃ‚Â® presents linearity between 0. 01 and 0. 125 mM (y = - 9. 5789 x+ 1. 4533, where y represents the value of absorbance and x, the value of TroloxÃ‚Â® concentration, expressed as mM; r 2 = 0. 9963).

In order to investigate this process, we developed a reaction system, where pink-red pigments (‘pinking’) can be formed by reacting amino acids with onion thiosulfinate formed by reacting an isolated garlic alliinase and (+) -S- 1 -propenyl-L-cysteine sulfoxide (1 -PeCSO) <b>in</b> the <b>natural</b> onion <b>juice.</b> The unknown pink-red pigments formed during this process were separated and detected using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and a diode array detector (DAD) at 515 nm. Fractions collected from this separation were further analyzed using liquid chromatography (LC) and tandem mass spectrometry. Similar head group structure, two 3, 4 -dimethyl pyrrolyl rings that were cross linked by allyl group, was determined for all conjugate-pigments formed from different amino acids based on the accurate and tandem mass spectrometry. However, the tail group attached to the N-terminal of pyrrole ring differed for each pink-red pigment depending on the amino acid used. In addition, in most cases more than one pink compound were identified for the same amino acid used. We presumed that the complexity of the pink-red pigments was due to the involvement of 21 natural amino acids and other derivatives of the products. Finally, we suggest that the pinking process in crushed onion is very similar to the greening process in crushed garlic, emphasizing that thiosulfinates from flavor precursors and free amino acids are absolutely necessary during the discoloration...|$|R
