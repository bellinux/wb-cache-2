40|$|The empathy {{literature}} {{is characterized by}} debate regarding {{the nature of the}} phenomenon. We propose a unified theory of empathy, divided into ultimate and proximate levels, grounded in the emotional link between individuals. On an ultimate level, emotional linkage supports <b>group</b> <b>alarm,</b> vicariousness of emotions, mother-infant responsiveness, and the modeling of competitors and predators; these exist across species and greatly effect reproductive success. Proximately, emotional linkage arises from a direct mapping of another's behavioral state onto a subject's behavioral representations, which activate responses in the subject. This ultimate and proximate account parsimoniously explains different phylogenetic and ontogenetic levels of empathy. The empathy literature has been characterized by disagreement regarding the exact nature of the phenomenon. There are emotional, cognitive, and conditioning views of empathy, and these views apply to different extents across species. We argue that with an adequate description of the ultimate and proximate mechanism, these views can be cohered into a unified whole. We use an interdisciplinary approach along ultimate and proximate levels for a unified theory grounded in the fact that individuals are behaviorally, physiologically and neurologically linked.

40|$|In literature, empathy {{has been}} {{characterized}} by a disagreement regarding {{the exact nature of}} the phenomenon. There are emotional, cognitive, and conditioning views of empathy, and these views apply to different extents across species. These forms of emotional linkage support <b>group</b> <b>alarm,</b> vicariousness of emotions, mother-infant responsiveness, and the modelling of competitors and predators; these forms have profound effects on reproductive success. 	Taking into account the possible mechanisms underlying gelada’s spontaneous yawn, emotional contagion and emotional response to conflicts between other group members, our results provide information which can have important theoretical implications. In fact, our findings are consistent with the view that contagious yawning reveals an emotional connection between individuals and also that empathy {{could be one of the}} mechanisms involved in triadic post-conflict affiliation. 	We recorded the behaviours of individual belonging to two colonies of geladas, (Theropithecus gelada), a species characterized by a female-centred one-male society, living at the NaturZoo (Rheine, Germany). Data were collected during a 6 -month period in 2007 (June-November), a 4 -month period in 2009 (June-September), a 2 -month period in 2010 (July-August) and a 2 -month period in 2011 (July-August). 	The gelada is a good model species because they have a strong sexual dimorphism, a clear-cut linear hierarchy, high social cohesiveness and fine-tuning towards companions. In the first study, we focussed on some social hypotheses on the potential functions of spontaneous yawning according to its patterns and contexts. Geladas, perform yawning according to three different visual intensity modalities, which are easy to be detected due to the diverse degree of mouth opening. We investigated whether the patterns of the yawn performance is predictive of its potential functions. YW 1, YW 2, and YW 3 can transmit different meanings according to the performer, the context and the behavioural pattern temporally associated to the yawn event. Moreover scratching, used as a reliable measure of anxiety, increased after each yawning type, even though the subjects tended to scratch themselves more after YW 3, thus suggesting that this type of yawn can indicate an even higher variation of arousal. All the three types of yawning were more frequent in the early morning with YW 3 also showing an additional daily peak (pre-feeding). Even though a clear cut functional distinction of the diverse types of gelada yawns is complicated, we suggest that YW 1 and YW 2, being more linked to an emotional internal state, can be considered "true" yawns and YW 3 can function as a multimodal signal which can be more modulated and affected by external social events. 	In the second study we assessed that in gelada baboons yawning is contagious, especially between socially close individuals; in fact, the contagiousness of yawning correlated with the level of grooming between subjects. Adult females showed precise matching of different yawning types, which suggests a mirroring mechanism that activates shared representations. We suggested that females have an enhanced sensitivity and emotional tuning toward companions compared to males. 	In the third study, we tested some hypotheses on the potential functions of triadic affiliation in geladas. We enlightened that the positive outcome of the triadic post-conflict affiliation is focussed more on victims than on bystanders (Self-Protection Hypothesis) or other group members (Tension Reduction Hypothesis), which apparently do not gain any kind of benefits by the behaviour. Moreover, it seems that triadic post-conflict affiliation does not have a role in restoring relationships between former opponents (Substitute for Reconciliation Hypothesis), so that reconciliation and triadic post-conflict affiliation co-exist and co-cooperate for two different purposes. After conflicts of high intensity levels, triadic affiliation improves the emotional state of the victim (Consolation Hypothesis) by lowering his/her levels of anxiety, especially when the victim is a kin or a close-bonded partner. In this case, a stronger emotional response can be elicited in the third-party which directs a higher frequency of affinitive acts towards the victim as predicted by the sympathetic concern hypothesis already suggested for humans and apes. 	As a whole, our findings indicate that two of the multiple levels of empathy described in literature for humans and apes (emotional contagion and sympathetic concern) are probably present in monkeys as well...|$|E

25|$|Alarm pheromones warn {{members of}} a species of {{approaching}} danger. Because of their altruistic nature, they follow the rules of kin selection. They can elicit both aggregational and dispersive responses in social insects depending on the alarm caller’s location relative to the nest. Closer to the nest, it causes social insects to aggregate and may subsequently produce an attack against the threat. The Polistes canadensis, a primitively eusocial wasp species, will emit a chemical alarm substance at the approach of a predator, which will lower their nestmates' thresholds for attack, and even attract more nestmates to the alarm. The colony is thus able to rise quickly with its sting chambers open to defend its nest against predators. In nonsocial insects, these compounds typically stimulate dispersal regardless of location. Chemical alarm systems are best developed in aphids and treehoppers (family Membracidae) among the nonsocial <b>groups.</b> <b>Alarm</b> pheromones take {{on a variety of}} compositions, ranging from terpenoids in aphids and termites to acetates, an alcohol, and a ketone in honeybees to formic acid and terpenoids in ants.|$|R

Alarm-calling rates are also temporally coupled with measures of eagle activity. There were considerable differences between the species in both rates and spatial patterns of alarm calling. The variation we measure in predation risk is expected to have consequences at the behavioural and population level...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the demographic characteristics and risk factors among patients with thyroid malignancy at the Cancer institute and Imam Khomeini hospital in Tehran Iran. Methods: This is a retrospective descriptive study of the charts of 320 patients admitted with the diagnosis of thyroid malignancy based on pathologic reports in the above- mentioned hospitals from 1992 to 2002. Results: From the 320 patients diagnosed with thyroid malignancy 68. 1 % were papillary cancer, 10. 9 % were follicular cancer, 10. 6 % were anaplastic cancer, 9. 06 % were medullary cancer and 1. 2 % were lymphoma. The average of the patients was 50. 2 years, ranging from 12 to 98 years; 60. 6 % were female and 39. 4 %were male; 22. 8 % of the patients had histories of thyroid nodule and 5 % had received radiation therapy.

Behavioral responses to alarm pheromone differed between homogeneous and mixed groups, suggesting complex interactions. Antennae of both soldiers and pseudergates were sensitive to the frontal gland secretion and to (E,E) -α-farnesene, but soldiers showed stronger responses. The dose responses to (E,E) -α-farnesene were identical for both soldiers and pseudergates, suggesting that both castes use similar receptors to perceive (E,E) -α-farnesene.
