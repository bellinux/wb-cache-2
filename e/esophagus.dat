5|$|The {{thoracic}} duct, which drains {{the majority}} of the body's lymph, passes behind the <b>esophagus,</b> curving from lying behind the <b>esophagus</b> on the right in {{the lower part of the}} <b>esophagus,</b> to lying behind the <b>esophagus</b> on the left in the upper <b>esophagus.</b> The <b>esophagus</b> also lies in front of parts of the hemiazygos veins and the intercostal veins on the right side. The vagus nerve divides and covers the <b>esophagus</b> in a plexus.|$|E
5|$|An X-ray of {{swallowed}} barium {{may be used}} {{to reveal}} {{the size and shape of}} the <b>esophagus,</b> and the presence of any masses. The <b>esophagus</b> may also be imaged using a flexible camera inserted into the <b>esophagus,</b> in a procedure called an endoscopy. If an endoscopy is used on the stomach, the camera will also have to pass through the <b>esophagus.</b> During an endoscopy, a biopsy may be taken. If cancer of the <b>esophagus</b> is being investigated, other methods, including a CT scan, may also be used.|$|E
5|$|Many {{blood vessels}} serve the <b>esophagus,</b> with blood supply varying along its course. The upper {{parts of the}} <b>esophagus</b> and the upper esophageal {{sphincter}} receive blood from the inferior thyroid artery, {{the parts of the}} <b>esophagus</b> in the thorax from the bronchial arteries and branches directly from the thoracic aorta, and the lower parts of the <b>esophagus</b> and the lower esophageal sphincter receive blood from the left gastric artery and the left inferior phrenic artery. The venous drainage also differs along the course of the <b>esophagus.</b> The upper and middle parts of the <b>esophagus</b> drain into the azygos and hemiazygos veins, and blood from the lower part drains into the left gastric vein. All these veins drain into the superior vena cava, {{with the exception of the}} left gastric vein, which is a branch of the portal vein. Lymphatically, the upper third of the <b>esophagus</b> drains into the deep cervical lymph nodes, the middle into the superior and posterior mediastinal lymph nodes, and the lower <b>esophagus</b> into the gastric and celiac lymph nodes. This is similar to the lymphatic drainage of the abdominal structures that arise from the foregut, which all drain into the celiac nodes.|$|E
5|$|Several {{disorders}} {{affect the}} motility of food as it travels down the <b>esophagus.</b> This can cause difficult swallowing, called dysphagia, or painful swallowing, called odynophagia. Achalasia {{refers to a}} failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax properly, and generally develops later in life. This leads to progressive enlargement of the <b>esophagus,</b> and possibly eventual megaesophagus. A nutcracker <b>esophagus</b> refers to swallowing that can be extremely painful. Diffuse esophageal spasm is a spasm of the <b>esophagus</b> that can be one cause of chest pain. Such referred pain to the wall of the upper chest is quite common in esophageal conditions. Sclerosis of the <b>esophagus,</b> such as with systemic sclerosis or in CREST syndrome may cause hardening of the walls of the <b>esophagus</b> and interfere with peristalsis.|$|E
5|$|The muscular {{layer of}} the <b>esophagus</b> has two types of muscle. The upper third of the <b>esophagus</b> {{contains}} striated muscle, the lower third contains smooth muscle, and the middle third contains a mixture of both. Muscle is arranged in two layers: {{one in which the}} muscle fibers run longitudinal to the <b>esophagus,</b> and the other in which the fibers encircle the <b>esophagus.</b> These are separated by the myenteric plexus, a tangled network of nerve fibers involved in the secretion of mucus and in peristalsis of the smooth muscle of the <b>esophagus.</b> The outermost {{layer of the}} <b>esophagus</b> is the adventitia in most of its length, with the abdominal part being covered in serosa. This makes it distinct from many other structures in the gastrointestinal tract that only have a serosa.|$|E
5|$|The {{surrounded}} sac {{becomes the}} primitive gut. Sections of this gut begin to differentiate into the organs of the gastrointestinal tract, {{such as the}} <b>esophagus,</b> stomach, and intestines. The <b>esophagus</b> develops {{as part of the}} foregut tube. The innervation of the <b>esophagus</b> develops from the pharyngeal arches.|$|E
5|$|A {{structure}} {{with the same}} name is often found in invertebrates, including molluscs and arthropods, connecting the oral cavity with the stomach. In terms of the digestive system of snails and slugs, the mouth opens into an <b>esophagus,</b> which connects to the stomach. Because of torsion, which is {{the rotation of the}} main body of the animal during larval development, the <b>esophagus</b> usually passes around the stomach, and opens into its back, furthest from the mouth. In species that have undergone de-torsion, however, the <b>esophagus</b> may open into the anterior of the stomach, which is the reverse of the usual gastropod arrangement. There is an extensive rostrum at the front of the <b>esophagus</b> in all carnivorous snails and slugs. In the freshwater snail species Tarebia granifera, the brood pouch is above the <b>esophagus.</b>|$|E
5|$|About 20,000 protein-coding {{genes are}} {{expressed}} in human cells and nearly 70% of these genes {{are expressed in}} the normal <b>esophagus.</b> Some 250 of these genes are more specifically expressed in the <b>esophagus</b> with less than 50 genes being highly specific. The corresponding esophagus-specific proteins are mainly involved in squamous differentiation such as keratins KRT13, KRT4 and KRT6C. Other specific proteins that help lubricate the inner surface of <b>esophagus</b> are mucins such as MUC21 and MUC22. Many genes with elevated expression are also shared with skin and other organs that are composed of squamous epithelia.|$|E
5|$|Food is {{ingested}} {{through the}} mouth and when swallowed passes first into the pharynx {{and then into the}} <b>esophagus.</b> The <b>esophagus</b> is thus one of the first components of the digestive system and the gastrointestinal tract. After food passes through the <b>esophagus,</b> it enters the stomach. When food is being swallowed, the epiglottis moves backward to cover the larynx, preventing food from entering the trachea. At the same time, the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes, allowing a bolus of food to enter. Peristaltic contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down the <b>esophagus.</b> These rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth, and also {{as a response to the}} sensation of food within the <b>esophagus</b> itself. Along with peristalsis, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes.|$|E
5|$|In most fish, the <b>esophagus</b> is {{extremely}} short, {{primarily due to}} the length of the pharynx (which is associated with the gills). However, some fish, including lampreys, chimaeras, and lungfish, have no true stomach, so that the <b>esophagus</b> effectively runs from the pharynx directly to the intestine, and is therefore somewhat longer.|$|E
5|$|In the cephalopods, {{the brain}} often {{surrounds}} the <b>esophagus.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>esophagus</b> {{is one of}} {{the upper}} parts of the {{digestive}} system. There are taste buds on its upper part. It begins {{at the back of the}} mouth, passing downwards through the rear part of the mediastinum, through the diaphragm, and into the stomach. In humans, the <b>esophagus</b> generally starts around the level of the sixth cervical vertebra behind the cricoid cartilage of the trachea, enters the diaphragm at about the level of the tenth thoracic vertebra, and ends at the cardia of the stomach, at the level of the eleventh thoracic vertebra. The <b>esophagus</b> is usually about 25cm (10in) in length.|$|E
5|$|The {{first attempt}} at surgery on the <b>esophagus</b> focused in the neck, and was {{conducted}} in dogs by Theodore Billroth in 1871. In 1877 Czerny carried out surgery in people. By 1908, an operation had been performed by Voeckler to remove the <b>esophagus,</b> and in 1933 the first surgical removal of parts of the lower <b>esophagus,</b> (to control esophageal cancer), had been conducted.|$|E
5|$|The upper <b>esophagus</b> lies at {{the back}} of the {{mediastinum}} behind the trachea, adjoining along the tracheoesophageal stripe, and in front of the erector spinae muscles and the vertebral column. The lower <b>esophagus</b> lies behind the heart and curves in front of the thoracic aorta. From the bifurcation of the trachea downwards, the <b>esophagus</b> passes behind the right pulmonary artery, left main bronchus, and left atrium. At this point it passes through the diaphragm.|$|E
5|$|In {{its early}} stages, esophageal cancer {{may not have}} any {{symptoms}} at all. When severe, esophageal cancer may eventually cause obstruction of the <b>esophagus,</b> making swallowing of any solid foods very difficult and causing weight loss. The progress of the cancer is staged using a system that measures how far into the esophageal wall the cancer has invaded, how many lymph nodes are affected, and whether there are any metastases {{in different parts of}} the body. Esophageal cancer is often managed with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and may also be managed by partial surgical removal of the <b>esophagus.</b> Inserting a stent into the <b>esophagus,</b> or inserting a nasogastric tube, may also be used to ensure that a person is able to digest enough food and water. , the prognosis for esophageal cancer is still poor, so palliative therapy may also be a focus of treatment.|$|E
5|$|In many vertebrates, the <b>esophagus</b> {{is lined}} by {{stratified}} squamous epithelium without glands. In fish, the <b>esophagus</b> is often lined with columnar epithelium, and in amphibians, sharks and rays, the esophageal epithelium is ciliated, helping to wash food along, {{in addition to}} the action of muscular peristalsis. In addition, in the bat Plecotus auritus, fish and some amphibians, glands secreting pepsinogen or hydrochloric acid have been found.|$|E
5|$|Little {{comprehensive}} {{data regarding}} rumination syndrome in otherwise healthy individuals exists because most sufferers are private about their illness {{and are often}} misdiagnosed due {{to the number of}} symptoms and the clinical similarities between rumination syndrome and other disorders of the stomach and <b>esophagus,</b> such as gastroparesis and bulimia nervosa. These symptoms include the acid-induced erosion of the <b>esophagus</b> and enamel, halitosis, malnutrition, severe weight loss and an unquenchable appetite. Individuals may begin regurgitating within a minute following ingestion, and the full cycle of ingestion and regurgitation can mimic the binging and purging of bulimia.|$|E
5|$|Stage IV or AIDS: severe {{symptoms}} {{which include}} toxoplasmosis of the brain, candidiasis of the <b>esophagus,</b> trachea, bronchi or lungs and Kaposi's sarcoma. A CD4 count {{of less than}} 200/µl.|$|E
5|$|The cephalic {{molluscs}} {{have two}} pairs of main nerve cords organized around a number of paired ganglia, the visceral cords serving the internal organs and the pedal ones serving the foot. Most pairs of corresponding ganglia {{on both sides of}} the body are linked by commissures (relatively large bundles of nerves). The ganglia above the gut are the cerebral, the pleural, and the visceral, which are located above the <b>esophagus</b> (gullet). The pedal ganglia, which control the foot, are below the <b>esophagus</b> and their commissure and connectives to the cerebral and pleural ganglia surround the <b>esophagus</b> in a circumesophageal nerve ring or nerve collar.|$|E
5|$|The <b>esophagus</b> is {{innervated by}} the vagus nerve and the {{cervical}} and thoracic sympathetic trunk. The vagus nerve has a parasympathetic function, supplying {{the muscles of}} the <b>esophagus</b> and stimulating glandular contraction. Two sets of nerve fibers travel in the vagus nerve to supply the muscles. The upper striated muscle, and upper esophageal sphincter, are supplied by neurons with bodies in the nucleus ambiguus, whereas fibers that supply the smooth muscle and lower esophageal sphincter have bodies situated in the dorsal motor nucleus. The vagus nerve plays the primary role in initiating peristalsis. The sympathetic trunk has a sympathetic function. It may enhance the function of the vagus nerve, increasing peristalsis and glandular activity, and causing sphincter contraction. In addition, sympathetic activation may relax the muscle wall and cause blood vessel constriction. Sensation along the <b>esophagus</b> is supplied by both nerves, with gross sensation being passed in the vagus nerve and pain passed up the sympathetic trunk.|$|E
5|$|The <b>esophagus</b> is {{surrounded}} {{at the top}} and bottom by two muscular rings, known respectively as the upper esophageal sphincter and the lower esophageal sphincter. These sphincters act to close the <b>esophagus</b> when food is not being swallowed. The esophageal sphincters are functional but not anatomical, meaning that they act as sphincters but do not have distinct thickenings like other sphincters.|$|E
5|$|The <b>esophagus</b> {{of snakes}} is {{remarkable}} for the distension it undergoes when swallowing prey.|$|E
5|$|The lower esophageal sphincter, or {{gastroesophageal}} sphincter, {{surrounds the}} lower part of the <b>esophagus</b> at the junction between the <b>esophagus</b> and the stomach. It is also called the cardiac sphincter or cardioesophageal sphincter, named from the adjacent part of the stomach, the cardia. Dysfunction of the gastroesophageal sphincter causes gastroesophageal , which causes heartburn and if it happens often enough, can lead to gastroesophageal reflux disease, with damage of the esophageal mucosa.|$|E
5|$|The lungs of {{lungfish}} {{are similar}} to those of amphibians, with few, if any, internal septa. In the Australian lungfish, there is only a single lung, albeit divided into two lobes. Other lungfish and Polypterus, however, have two lungs, which are located in the upper part of the body, with the connecting duct curving around and above the <b>esophagus.</b> The blood supply also twists around the <b>esophagus,</b> suggesting that the lungs originally evolved in the ventral part of the body, as in other vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|The main {{conditions}} {{affecting the}} <b>esophagus</b> are described here. For {{a more complete}} list, see esophageal disease.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the most}} common {{congenital}} malformations affecting the <b>esophagus</b> are an esophageal atresia where the oesophagus ends in a blind sac instead of connecting to the stomach; and an esophageal fistula – an abnormal connection between the <b>esophagus</b> and the trachea. Both of these conditions usually occur together. These are found in about 1 in 3500 births. Half of these cases may be part of a syndrome where other abnormalities are also present, particularly of the heart or limbs. The other cases occur singly.|$|E
5|$|Alvarez died on September 1, 1988, due to {{complications}} from {{a succession of}} recent operations for cancer of the <b>esophagus.</b> He was cremated, and his ashes were scattered over Monterey Bay. His papers are in The Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley.|$|E
5|$|Aonchotheca forresteri is a small, narrow-bodied worm. It is narrowest at {{the front}} and {{increases}} in width to about three fourths of its length. The cuticle, the surface layer, is smooth. Females are 13.8 to 19.4mm long, averaging 16.9mm, which makes them substantially longer than female A.putorii, and 55 to 70 (average 62) μm wide. The eggs are smooth, lacking the elaborate pattern on the surface seen in A.putorii, and are 53 to 58 (54) μm long and 21 to 24 (21) μm broad. The <b>esophagus,</b> the frontmost part of the digestive system, is 2.9 to 3.9 (3.6) mm long and is lined by 36 to 45 (40) cells known as stichocytes. The vulva is located 66 to 105 (83) μm behind {{the end of the}} <b>esophagus</b> and the anus is {{near the end of the}} worm, which is rounded.|$|E
5|$|As the {{recurrent}} nerve hooks {{around the}} subclavian artery or aorta, it gives off several branches. There is suspected {{variability in the}} configuration of these branches to the cardiac plexus, trachea, <b>esophagus</b> and inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle.|$|E
5|$|High-dose rate (HDR) {{brachytherapy}} is {{when the}} rate of dose delivery exceeds 12Gy·h−1. The most common applications of HDR brachytherapy are in tumours of the cervix, <b>esophagus,</b> lungs, breasts and prostate. Most HDR treatments are performed on an outpatient basis, but this {{is dependent on the}} treatment site.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{arthropod}} {{central nervous}} system consists {{of a pair of}} nerve cords running below the gut, with paired ganglia as local control centers in all segments; a brain formed by fusion of the ganglia for the head segments ahead of and behind the mouth, so that the <b>esophagus</b> is encircled by this conglomeration of ganglia. Except for the primitive Mesothelae, of which the Liphistiidae are the sole surviving family, spiders have the much more centralized nervous system that is typical of arachnids: all the ganglia of all segments behind the <b>esophagus</b> are fused, so that the cephalothorax is largely filled with nervous tissue and there are no ganglia in the abdomen; in the Mesothelae, the ganglia of the abdomen and the rear part of the cephalothorax remain unfused.|$|E
5|$|The human <b>esophagus</b> has a mucous {{membrane}} {{consisting of a}} tough stratified squamous epithelium without keratin, a smooth lamina propria, and a muscularis mucosae. The epithelium of the <b>esophagus</b> has a relatively rapid turnover, and serves a protective function against the abrasive effects of food. In many animals the epithelium contains a layer of keratin, representing a coarser diet. There {{are two types of}} glands, with mucus-secreting esophageal glands being found in the submucosa, and esophageal cardiac glands, similar to cardiac glands of the stomach, located in the lamina propria and most frequent in the terminal part of the organ. The mucus from the glands gives a good protection to the lining. The submucosa also contains the submucosal plexus, a network of nerve cells {{that is part of the}} enteric nervous system.|$|E
5|$|The nerves {{also carry}} sensory {{information}} from the mucous membranes of the larynx below the lower surface of the vocal fold, as well as sensory, secretory and motor fibres to the cervical segments of the <b>esophagus</b> and the trachea.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of subcutaneous emphysema {{in a person}} who appears quite ill and febrile after bout of vomiting followed by left chest pain is very suggestive of the diagnosis of Boerhaave's syndrome, which is a life-threatening emergency caused by rupture of the distal <b>esophagus.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves supply sensation to {{the larynx}} below the vocal cords, gives cardiac branches {{to the deep}} cardiac plexus, and branches to the trachea, <b>esophagus</b> and the inferior constrictor muscles. The posterior cricoarytenoid muscles, the only muscles that can open the vocal cords, are innervated by this nerve.|$|E
5|$|The upper esophageal {{sphincter}} {{surrounds the}} upper part of the <b>esophagus.</b> It consists of skeletal muscle but is not under voluntary control. Opening of the upper esophageal sphincter is triggered by the swallowing reflex. The primary muscle of the upper esophageal sphincter is the cricopharyngeal part of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor.|$|E
