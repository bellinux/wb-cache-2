500|$|Thompson {{spent five}} years writing and {{revising}} the screenplay, both during and between shooting other films. Believing the novel's language to be [...] "far more arcane than in [...] later books," [...] Thompson sought to simplify the dialogue while retaining the [...] "elegance and wit of the original." [...] She observed that in a screenwriting process, a first draft often had [...] "a lot of good stuff in it" [...] but needed to be edited, and second drafts would [...] "almost certainly be rubbish... because {{you get into a}} panic." [...] Thompson credits Doran for [...] "help me, nourish me and mentor me through that process... <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> screenwriting at her feet." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{few weeks}} before the Olympics, Evans had signed a deal with the University of Arizona, and he went there to study and swim after the Olympics. Evans was to spend five years in Arizona {{studying}} for a BA in business. He regarded his American experience as a crucial component of his development: [...] "I got a good education, but above all <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> myself". The American laissez faire attitude—which revolved around the individual's self-determination—sat well with Evans' outlook on life. He often clashed with Arizona swimming coach Dick Jochums, who was regarded as a hard taskmaster. The pair clashed over the training regime; Jochums insisted that Evans increase his mileage, something that the student strongly resisted. Evans was an All-American for four years, but he struggled in the short-course pools used in the college system. Short-course pools—which are only half the length—place more emphasis on a swimmer's turning ability, which was the Australian's weakness. Despite his ranking as third in the world at the Olympics, which are swum in long-course pools, Evans was ranked only fifth in the college system.|$|E
500|$|Although both singers {{worked with}} {{producer}} Benny Blanco in studio on [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful", Spears recorded her vocals {{for the song}} before Sabi, who actually raps on the track. The latter also revealed she felt lucky and honored because Spears does not do features often, while commenting that [...] "it's just pretty crazy, I mean, I grew up watching Britney Spears. All my friends watched Britney Spears and we even had a routine to [...] that we were gonna perform, like, for a middle-school talent show. So it's a dream come true. Never did I ever think that I'd be in the mix with Britney. I'm just lucky." [...] When asked about how she learned about Sabi {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone, Spears revealed, [...] "friends and people around me are always showing me new artists that they love and that's how <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> Sabi and ended up working with her on '(Drop Dead) Beautiful'. I have always wanted to feature a new artist on one of my albums and she is really cool." [...] A small teaser of the song was unveiled by the singer on March 7, 2011. Four days later, it leaked in full online, along with another Femme Fatale track, [...] "Inside Out". On August 5, 2011, Spears posted a poll on her Facebook page asking fans whether her next single should be [...] "Criminal", [...] "Inside Out" [...] or [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful." [...] After the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, she revealed to MTV News that [...] "Criminal" [...] was chosen as the fourth single.|$|E

500|$|In {{his book}} Banker to the Poor: Micro-lending and the Battle Against World Poverty, Muhammad Yunus shows the outlook behind why Grameen Bank runs {{the way it}} does, saying, “ When you hold the world in your palm and inspect it only from a birds eye view, you tend to become arrogant, you do not realize things become blurred when viewed from an {{enormous}} distance. I opted instead for the” worms eye view.” … [...] The poor taught me an entirely new economics. <b>I</b> <b>learned</b> <b>about</b> the problems they face from their own perspective. “ Here we see his willingness to immerse himself with the people he is aiming to help. [...] We get our first look at Muhammad Yunus's perception of the absolute poor when he meets Sufiya Begum, a bamboo stool maker who was trapped in poverty's vicious cycle {{due to a lack}} of 27 cents. That is where we find that what will become Grameen bank, is founded upon one man's heart for those that society and big corporations could or would not help. [...] Taking productive action, Yunus worked with the banks and community around to empower people like Sufiya to be able to apply for credit, and use it in the best and most productive way that she knows how in her unique situation. [...] Grameen Bank would need to be a bank of unusual standards. It would have to be, as Yunus put it, [...] "an institution that would lend to those that had nothing. [...] " [...] Later, as time progressed, more situations would arise, such as battling for those who were landless, or small-time farmers such as those in Jobra who could not use a deep tube-well that was available to them.|$|E

The truth of the world is that it is chaotic.

Clarence and his siblings attended the Leak country school until 1898, when the family moved northward to the Job Hadley farm, where the children attended another country school. In both residences, Clarence pursued an interest in archery, playing with bows and arrows made by his father. By his own account, The arrows had heavy heads so {{that we did not}} need feathers to guide the arrow.... We boys shot fish with bows, using umbrella staves as arrows.

6000|$|I never shall {{want another}} Turkish lunch. The cooking {{apparatus}} {{was in the}} little lunch room, near the bazaar, {{and it was all}} open to the street. The cook was slovenly, and so was the table, and it had no cloth on it. The fellow took a mass of sausage meat and coated it round a wire and laid it on a charcoal fire to cook. When it was done, he laid it aside and a dog walked sadly in and nipped it. He smelt it first, and probably recognized the remains of a friend. The cook took it away from him and laid it before us. Jack said, [...] "I pass"--he plays euchre sometimes--and we all passed in turn. Then the cook baked a broad, flat, wheaten cake, greased it well with the sausage, and started towards us with it. It dropped in the dirt, and he picked it up and polished it on his breeches, and laid it before us. Jack said, [...] "I pass." [...] We all passed. He put some eggs in a frying pan, and stood pensively prying slabs of meat from between his teeth with a fork. Then he used the fork to turn the eggs with--and brought them along. Jack said [...] "Pass again." [...] All followed suit. We {{did not know what to}} do, and so we ordered a new ration of sausage. The cook got out his wire, apportioned a proper amount of sausage-meat, spat it on his hands and fell to work! This time, with one accord, we all passed out. We paid and left.
