2500|$|In the {{memoirs of}} Giacomo Casanova, he remarked {{that the name}} [...] "Parmesan" [...] was a misnomer common {{throughout}} an [...] "ungrateful" [...] Europe in his time (mid-18th century), as the cheese was produced {{in the town of}} Lodi, Lombardy, not Parma. Though Casanova knew his table and claimed in his memoir to have been compiling a (never completed) dictionary of cheeses, his comment has been taken to refer mistakenly to a grana cheese similar to [...] "Parmigiano", <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano,</b> which is produced in the Lodi area.|$|E

50|$|On {{an annual}} basis, the <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> {{consortium}} exports € 750 million (£570 million) of their product.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, {{within the}} European Union, the word Grana forms an {{integral}} and {{essential part of}} <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> PDO, and as such, cannot be used for trade within the EU separately from the word Padano, and must refer only to cheeses that have been granted <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> PDO status. This was confirmed in 2007 by a ruling of the First Instance European Court of Justice (12 September 2007, case T-291/03).|$|E
50|$|<b>Grana</b> <b>padano</b> cheese {{typically}} contains cheese crystals, semi-solid to gritty crystalline {{spots that}} at least partially consist of the amino acid tyrosine.|$|E
50|$|Hard cheeses—grating cheeses such as <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano,</b> Parmesan or Pecorino—are quite {{firmly packed}} into large forms and aged {{for months or}} years.|$|E
50|$|Production of <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> and Parmigiano-Reggiano hard cheeses {{was badly}} affected; {{approximately}} 300,000 wheels, {{with an estimated}} value of €200 million, were destroyed.|$|E

50|$|The two best-known {{examples}} of grana-type cheeses are Parmigiano-Reggiano and <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano.</b> The two cheeses are broadly similar, {{with the latter}} being less sharp, crumbly and grainy.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of Trentingrana {{is not an}} exception, {{as it has been}} granted - in view of a legal ruling (D.P.R. 26/01/87) and due to particular methods of production - the right to specify the area of production (independent Province of Trent) though still remaining to every extent subject to <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> PDO (Protected Designation of Origin, in Italian Denominazione di Origine Protetta), as it maintains all its characteristics, has to comply with the same production standards and is subject to the controls and services of the Consortium for the Protection of <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> Cheese.|$|E
50|$|Like Parmigiano Reggiano, <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> is a semi-fat {{hard cheese}} which is cooked and ripened slowly {{for at least}} nine months. If it passes quality tests, it is fire-branded with the <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> trademark. The cows are milked twice a day, the milk is left to stand, and then {{partially}} skimmed. Milk produced in the evening is skimmed to remove the surface layer of cream and mixed with fresh milk produced in the morning. The partly skimmed milk is transferred into copper kettles and coagulated; the resulting curd is cut to produce granules {{with the size of}} rice grains, which gives the cheese its characteristic texture, and then warmed to 53 - 56 C. It is produced year-round and the quality can vary seasonally as well as by year. Though similar to Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, the younger <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> cheeses are less crumbly, milder and less complex in flavor than their better known, longer-aged relative.|$|E
50|$|Grana {{originally}} {{referred to}} a class of hard, mature cheeses from Italy which have a granular texture and are often used for grating. These cheeses are typically made {{in the form of}} large drums. The structure is often described as crystalline, and the drums are divided by being split with a fairly blunt triangular knife designed for the purpose, rather than being sliced, cut or sawn. Within the European Union, the term Grana is now legally protected by <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> Protected Designation of Origin, such that only <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> may be sold using the term in EU countries.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, from 1954, {{the type}} Grana has been {{absorbed in the}} species {{represented}} by the new designations <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> and Parmigiano-Reggiano, and as such does not exist anymore as a designation of its own.|$|E
50|$|In May, 2016, the <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> {{consortium}} filed a {{legal action}} against the producers of the U.S. television soap opera series The Bold and the Beautiful for a scene wherein it was claimed the product was disparaged.|$|E
50|$|Hard cheeses where cheese {{crystals}} {{are common}} and valued include comte, aged cheddar, grana cheeses like parmesan, <b>grana</b> <b>padano,</b> and Pecorino Romano, {{as well as}} old gouda. However, in some cheeses, like industrial cheddar, they are considered a production defect.|$|E

50|$|Pesto alla genovese, {{the quintessential}} pesto recipe, {{is made with}} Genovese basil, coarse salt, garlic, Ligurian {{extra virgin olive oil}} (Taggiasco), European pine nuts (sometimes toasted) and a grated cheese like Parmigiano Reggiano or <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> and {{pecorino}} sardo or pecorino romano.|$|E
50|$|Piacentine {{staple foods}} include corn (generally cooked as polenta) and rice (usually cooked as risotto), {{both of which}} are very common across {{northern}} Italy. There are also locally produced cheeses, such as <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano,</b> though nearby Parma is more famous for its dairy products.|$|E
50|$|An {{emblem of}} Italian cuisine, {{spaghetti}} is frequently served with tomato sauce, which may contain various herbs, (especially oregano and basil), olive oil, meat, or vegetables. Other spaghetti preparations include amatriciana or carbonara. Grated hard cheeses, such as Pecorino Romano, Parmesan and <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano,</b> are often sprinkled on top.|$|E
50|$|A {{wheel of}} <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> is cylindrical, with {{slightly}} convex or almost straight sides and flat faces. It measures 35 to 45 cm in diameter, and 15 to 18 cm in height. It weighs 24 to 40 kg (53 to 88 lbs) per wheel. The rind, which is thin, is pale yellow.|$|E
50|$|Bagolino is a comune in the {{province}} of Brescia, in Lombardy, Italy, in the valley of the river Caffaro, {{on the right side of}} Valle Sabbia. Bagolino is known for the cheese named Bagòss and the carnival. Similar to <b>grana</b> <b>padano,</b> Bagòss is a salty cheese with traces of natural mold at times.|$|E
50|$|The main {{difference}} between the two is that cows producing Parmigiano-Reggiano eat only grass and cereals (no silage), no preservatives and no antibiotics. Cows that have been treated with antibiotics are suspended from production of Parmigiano-Reggiano. Silage is a fermented forage that requires the addition of a natural preservative (lysozyme) to <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano.</b>|$|E
50|$|Regional cheeses include Robiola, Crescenza, Taleggio, Gorgonzola and <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> (the {{plains of}} central and {{southern}} Lombardy allow intensive cattle-raising). Polenta is generally common across the region. Regional desserts include the famous panettone Christmas cake (sweet bread with candied orange, citron, and lemon zest, as well as raisins, which are added dry and not soaked).|$|E
5000|$|The {{economy of}} Cremona is deeply {{linked to the}} {{agricultural}} production of the countryside. Food industries include salted meat, sweets (torrone), vegetable oils, <b>grana</b> <b>padano,</b> provolone and [...] "mostarda" [...] (candied fruit in spicy mustard-flavored syrup, served with meats and cheese). Heavy industries include steel, oil and one electric plant. The river-port is a base for the barges transporting goods along the Po river.|$|E
50|$|Bologna and Modena are {{notable for}} pasta dishes like tortellini, lasagne, gramigna and {{tagliatelle}} which are found also {{in many other}} parts of the region in different declinations. The celebrated balsamic vinegar is made only in the Emilian cities of Modena and Reggio Emilia, following legally binding traditional procedures. Parmigiano Reggiano cheese is produced in Reggio Emilia, Parma, Modena and Bologna and is much used in cooking, while <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> variety is produced in Piacenza.|$|E
50|$|Here as {{elsewhere}} in the Po valley the Cistercians, and later the Benedictines, were known for their industry in clearing the thickets and woodland and in draining the marshes so as to establish up-to-date agriculture practices based on a system of large farming establishments called granges. The origins of the hard Italian granular cheese known generically as grana—the best known examples today being <b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> and Parmigiano Reggiano (or Parmesan)—are traditionally ascribed to the monks of Chiaravalle.|$|E
50|$|<b>Grana</b> <b>Padano</b> {{is one of}} the world's first hard cheeses, created nearly 900 {{years ago}} by the Cistercian monks of Chiaravalle Abbey, founded in 1135 near Milan By the year 1477, it was {{regarded}} as one of the most famous cheeses of Italy. It can last a long time without spoiling, sometimes aging up to two years. It is made in a similar way to the Parmigiano Reggiano of Emilia-Romagna but over a much wider area and with different regulations and controls.|$|E
