50|$|A {{convection}} oven (also {{known as a}} fan-assisted oven or simply a <b>fan</b> <b>oven)</b> is an oven that has fans to circulate air around food. In the Philippines, this type of oven {{is often referred to}} as a turbo broiler.|$|E
50|$|Ovens usually can use {{a variety}} of methods to cook. The most common may be to heat the oven from below. This is {{commonly}} used for baking and roasting. The oven may also be able to heat from the top to provide broiling (US) or grilling (UK/Commonwealth). In order to provide faster, more-even cooking, a <b>fan</b> <b>oven,</b> which has a fan with a heating element around, that provides the heat. Or a fan-assisted oven that use a small fan to circulate the air in the cooking chamber, can be used. Both also known as convection ovens. An oven may also provide an integrated rotisserie.|$|E
40|$|Wet textile washing {{processes}} {{were set}} up for wool and cotton fabrics to evaluate the potential of ultrasound transducers (US) in improving dirt removal. The samples were contaminated with an emulsion of carbon soot in vegetable oil and aged for three hours in <b>fan</b> <b>oven.</b> Before washing, the fabrics were soaked for 3 min in a standard detergent solution and subsequently washed in a water bath. The dirt removal was evaluated through colorimetric measurements. The total color differences DE of the samples were measured with respect to an uncontaminated fabric, before and after each washing cycle. The percentage of DE variation obtained was calculated and correlated to the dirt removal. The {{results showed that the}} US transducers enhanced the dirt removal and temperature was the parameter most influencing the US efficiency on the cleaning process. Better results were obtained at a lower process temperatur...|$|E

The kitchen {{was equipped with}} 2 <b>fan</b> <b>ovens,</b> 2 removable refrigerators, a 4 ring hob, extractor fan system, microwave, dishwasher, panini (sandwich) toaster, hot water still and water steriliser.|$|R
50|$|In 1971 it {{introduced}} its Circotherm system whereby hot air was circulated around {{the oven to}} allow a distribution of cooking with more regularity. These cookers are known as convection <b>oven</b> or <b>fan</b> <b>ovens,</b> and are still for a specialist market. The Circotherm system was patented by the company, marketed under the slogan Rundum-Hitze ist mehr (all around heat is more). In 1985, the convection oven system was first introduced for gas ovens.|$|R

50|$|In {{factories}} in the 2010s, large jerky ovens are built using insulated panels. Inside these low-temperature drying ovens are many heater elements and <b>fans.</b> The <b>ovens</b> have exhaust ports to remove the moisture-laden air. The combination of fast-moving air and low heat dries the meat to the desired moisture content within a few hours. The raw, marinated jerky strips are placed on racks of nylon-coated metal screens which have been sprayed with a light vegetable oil to allow the meat to be removed easily. The screen trays are placed closely in layers on rolling carts which are then put in the drying oven.|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of hollow granules from hydrophobic powders in a high-shear mixer granulator {{has been investigated}} by changing the binder/powder mass ratio and studying its effects on granule size and structure. In this study, a mixer granulator was filled with 100 g of hydrophobic fumed silica and then varying quantities of 5 % Hydroxy Propyl Cellulose solution was slowly sprayed into granulator. A range of liquid to solid mass ratios between from 0. 5 : 1 to 15 : 1 was used. Granules were then dried at 60 °C in a <b>fan</b> forced <b>oven.</b> This paper compares the particle size distributions, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and X-ray tomography (XRT) images of hollow granules {{as a function of}} the liquid to solid mass ratio. The granule mean size increased and the fraction of un-granulated (fine) particles decreased as the liquid to solid mass ratio increased. Simultaneously, the morphology and structure of the hollow granules changed from a spherical to a deformed structure which indicates the importance of choosing the optimal liquid to solid mass ratio. The optimal liquid to solid mass ratio for Aerosil R 202 powder in this study was found to be between 3 : 1 and 6 : 1. The final granule shape and size distribution are dependent on the liquid to solid ratio if the liquid marble nucleation process starts with a preformed droplet template...|$|R
5000|$|From 1929 until 1980, {{the brand}} {{was owned by}} McGraw Electric, renamed to McGraw-Edison in 1957. Following a {{leveraged}} buyout in 1980 to Magic Chef, the brand changed hands several times and finally went public in 1992 as Toastmaster, Inc. The company, headquartered in Boonville, Missouri, United States, was acquired by Salton, Inc., in 1999. After a series of acquisitions, the brand is now owned by Spectrum Brands, Inc. and is licensed to Select Brands, Inc. [...] Commercial Toastmaster products for the food-service industry are manufactured by [...] The Middleby Corporation. Company headquarters were moved from Boonville, Missouri to Columbia, Missouri during the 1970's. Factories were located in Boonville, Missouri, Macon, Missouri, Moberly, Missouri, Kirksville, Missouri, Clarence, Missouri and Laurinburg, North Carolina. Three large warehouse facilities were operated in Columbia, Missouri, too. Product brands included Toastmaster, Manning-Bowman, Edison, Everhot, Bersted, Eskimo fans, Zero fans, Ingram clocks and timers and several others. The Vita-Mix blender was also built under contract with Vita-Mix. Products manufactured during the 1970 and 1980 decades were toasters, griddles, box fans, waffle bakers, sandwich makers, ceiling <b>fans,</b> toaster <b>ovens,</b> convection ovens, bread makers, humidifiers, clocks, timers, etc. Other products marketed by the company in the 1970 and 1980 decades were imported from oversea factories such as mixers, meat slicers, can openers, microwave <b>ovens,</b> oscillating <b>fans,</b> etc. Revenues from a sandwich maker known as the Snackster (originally sold exclusively to Walmart) were significant and lead to the company going public on NYSE in 1992.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel {{approach}} for data-driven Quality Management in industry processes that enables a multidimensional analysis of the anomalies that can appear and their real-time detection in the running system. The approach revolutionizes the way how quality control (and esp. anomaly detection) will be realized in production processes influenced by many parameters that can be in complex nonlinear correlations. It consists of two main steps: learning the normal behavior of the system (based on past data) and detecting an anomalous behavior in the real-time (by processing real-time data). The approach is especially suitable for modern industry systems that follow Industry 4. 0 principles of ubiquity sensing and proactive responding. One of the main advantages is the self-adaptive nature of the approach due to its data-driven orientation, so that the model and parameters of the approach will be continuously updated to the dynamicity of data. The approach has been applied {{in the process of}} manufacturing microwave ovens (Whirlpool) and in this paper we present results for the data-driven quality control {{of one of the most}} critical parts — microwave <b>oven</b> <b>fan.</b> Due to the high speed of the rotation, every item has to be very precisely produced (according to the CAD model), which requires very strong quality control process...|$|R
40|$|Industrialisation has {{resulted}} in large-scale production of anthropogenic pollutants, particularly heavy metals. Existing industrial techniques for the purification of waste water are expensive. A cheaper alternative may be 'bioremoval', that is, the accumulation and concentration of pollutants from aqueous solutions using biological material. The adsorption of copper, zinc and cadmium using two dried seaweeds Ecklonia maxima and Laminaria pallida (order Laminariales) and Kelpak waste (also made from Ecklonia maxima), a byproduct from the manufacture of the seaweed concentrate Kelpak, were investigated under laboratory conditions, to determine some factors affecting heavy metal adsorption. Ion adsorption from single and mixed metal ion solutions of 10 mgl− 1 and 100 mgl− 1 containing copper, zinc and cadmium were tested at various temperatures and pH. Optimum adsorption occurred at pH 3 and pH 7 and Kelpak waste had equal or superior adsorption ability to dried Ecklonia maxima and Laminaria pallida, particularly for copper. Optimum adsorption occurred at temperatures of 20 °C and 30 °C. Heavy metal adsorption trends by the individual seaweed biosorbent remained constant regardless of the species of anion present. Drying of the experimental material (<b>fan</b> air and <b>oven</b> drying at 85 °C) prior to adsorption cycles resulted in more efficient ion uptake, particularly after additional rehydration. Heavy metal uptake was monitored {{over a number of}} semi-continuous adsorption cycles, using the same biomasses. Ion uptake was the most efficient after 2 – 4 adsorption cycles...|$|R
40|$|Cosmos caudatus {{have high}} an ioxidant {{capacity}} {{and able to}} contribute to the capability to scavenge free radical ions and reduce oxidative stress. However, the antioxidants may decrease during the drying process which further reduces the functionality of the herb. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effect of drying methods on the antioxidant capacity of C. caudatus extract. Three different types of drying treatment were set; freeze dryer (- 40 °C, 72 hours), spray dryer (150 °C, 20 rpm of pump setting, 50 rpm of <b>fan</b> setting) and <b>oven</b> dryer (40 °C, 72 hours). In this study, Soxhiet extraction method was used and distilled water and 70 % acetone (v/v) as the extraction solvent. The determination of antioxidant and ascorbic acid content were tested by DPPH assay and HPLC analysis respectively. Freeze-dried sample of 70 % acetone (v/v) exhibits highest concentration of antioxidant (59. 00 mgAAE/g) followed by spray-dried and oven-dried sample (37. 00 mgAAE/g and 36. 00 mgAAE/g) respectively. HPLC analysis shows significant results of ascorbic acid content where freeze-dried sample of 70 % acetone (v/v) exhibits highest ascorbic acid concentration followed by spray-dried and oven-dried samples (1. 09 mgAAE/g, 0. 69 mgAAE/g and 0. 48 mgAAE/g) respectively. Freeze dryer was the efficient technique for the preservation of antioxidant compounds followed by spray dryer and oven dryer. Further study is proposed by differentiating predrying temperature and drying periods used for each dryer to discover the effect of predrying temperature and drying period on the antioxidant compounds preserved...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports the}} {{experimental}} measurements {{on the ability}} of biological origin surfactants (i. e. biosurfactants - aescin, lecithin, rhamnolipid, saponin and tannin) on removing crude oil and a heavy fuel oil blend from various soils, through soil washing process. The greatest advantage of soil washing {{is that it is a}} physical means of separating oil from soil using water or surfactants without chemically modifying either the soil or the oil. The oil removal performance of the biosurfactants was evaluated against that of a well studied synthetic surfactant (sodium dodecyl sulphate, SDS) using water as a base case. For this purpose, different washing settings (i. e. test tubes, stirred flasks, packed column, and air bubble assisted stirred tank) were used to treat contaminated soils with high oil toxicity. The effects of operational parameters such as washing temperature (5 to 500 C), washing time (1 to 20 minutes), concentration of surfactant solutions (0. 004 to 0. 5 %-mass), volume of surfactant solution (5 to 20 cm 3), flow rate (2 to 16 cm 3 /minutes), pore volume (10 to 70) and contamination history was investigated. The interaction of the surfactant solutions with the oil and soils was also investigated, which was used to explain the dominant mechanisms behind soil washing. The contaminated soils were prepared in the laboratory by mixing the oil and soils. Two different contamination cases were considered: weathered contamination in which freshly contaminated soils were subjected to heat treatment in a <b>fan</b> assisted <b>oven</b> (simulating weathering effect in the natural hot environments), and non-weathered contamination in which contaminated soils were not subjected to any heat treatment. The different washing techniques employed in this study yielded a novel and informative description on the selection of biosurfactants in the remediation of crude oil contaminated soils. This is believed to have major academic and industrial values for the treatment of (1) soil contaminated with oil, (2) sand produced with oil, (3) drill cuttings, (4) enhanced oil recovery, and (5) waste drilling mud and sludge from oil storage tank. In addition, the characterization of the biosurfactants in oil-water, soilwater and oil-soil systems give a general knowledge of their behaviour, which is important in the application for effective removal of oil from soil. Soil washing was found to have a considerable potential in removing oil from the different contaminated soils and results were comparable with those reported in literature. Oil removal by rhamnolipid was more effective than the other biosurfactants and water was effective at higher parameter levels. Further, biosurfactants can preferentially remove certain aromatic groups, which may be desirable for more rapid soil remediation. The rhamnolipid can be equally as efficient at removing oil from soil as SDS at a repeatability range of ± 6 %. However, rhamnolipid have advantages over SDS beacuase the use of rhamnolipid will eliminate the need for removing surfactants from effluents as their release will not damage the environment due to their safe natures. Other surfactants (bio and/or synthetic) can be blended with rhamnolipid to achieve greater performance characteristics. In general, the stirred tank and air bubble assisted stirred tank reactors settings were more effective in removing oil from the weathered and the non-weathered contaminated soil samples. The most influential parameter on the oil removal was washing solution temperature with more than 80 % of crude oil removal at 500 C. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
