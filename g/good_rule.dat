25|$|It is {{possible}} to have added tone chords {{with more than one}} added note. The most commonly encountered of these are 6/9 chords, which are basic triads with the 6th and 2nd notes of the scale added. These can be confusing because of the use of 9, yet the chord does not include the 7th. A <b>good</b> <b>rule</b> of thumb is that if any added note is less than 7, then no 7th is implied, even if there are some notes shown as greater than 7.|$|E
25|$|History of {{building}} the Umaid Bhawan Palace is linked to a curse by a saint who had said that a period of drought will follow the <b>good</b> <b>rule</b> of the Rathore Dynasty. Thus, {{after the end of}} about 50-year reign of Pratap Singh, Jodhpur faced a severe drought and famine conditions in the 1920s for a period of three consecutive years. The farmers of the area faced with famine conditions sought the help of the then king Umaid Singh, who was the 37th Rathore ruler of Marwar at Jhodpur, to provide them with some employment so that they could survive the famine conditions. The king, in order to help the farmers, decided to build a lavish palace. He commissioned Henry Vaughan Lanchester as the architect to prepare the plans for the palace; Lanchester was a contemporary of Sir Edwin Lutyens who planned the buildings of the New Delhi government complex. Lanchester patterned the Umaid Palace on the lines of the New Delhi building complex by adopting the theme of domes and columns. The palace was designed as an extraordinary blend of western technology, and many Indian architectural features.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for identifying and eliminating mislabeled instances in large or distributed datasets.

We construct <b>good</b> <b>rules</b> from each subset, and use the <b>good</b> <b>rules</b> to evaluate the whole dataset. For a given instance Ik, two error count variables are used to count the number of times it has been identified as noise by all subsets. The instance with higher error values will have a higher probability of being a mislabeled example. Two threshold schemes, majority and non-objection, are used to identify the noise. Experimental results and comparative studies from real-world datasets are reported to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. 1...|$|R

2500|$|Length – Boards for {{children}} are {{as short as}} boards for racers, or [...] "alpine" [...] riders, are as long as [...] Most people ride boards in the [...] range. Board length used to {{be judged by the}} height of your chin. If a board held next to the frontside of your body came to your chin then it was an acceptable length. Due to the development of new technologies and board shapes, people can now ride a wider range of board sizes. Rather, the length of a snowboard corresponds mainly to the style, weight, and preference of the rider. A <b>good</b> <b>rule</b> of thumb is to stay within the recommended manufacturer weight range. The longer the board, the more stable it is at high speed, {{but it is also a}} bit tougher to maneuver. Another factor riders consider when selecting a snowboard is the type of riding it will be used for, freestyle boards being shorter than all-mountain boards.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} {{formulas}} that viticulturist and winemakers {{can use that}} utilize the various measurements of sugar, acid and pH level. One method developed {{by researchers at the}} University of California-Davis is the Brix:TA ratio which uses the ratio of brix degrees to the TA measurements. For example, a wine with 22°Bx and [...]75 TA will have almost a 30:1 Brix:TA ratio. According to the Davis researchers, the most balanced table wines tend to have a Brix to TA ratio between 30:1 - 35:1. Another method is to multiply the pH reading by itself and then multiply that number by the Brix reading. Using this method, when white wine grapes gets close to 200 and red wine grapes close to 260, it can be a <b>good</b> <b>rule</b> of thumb of when to harvest. For example, white wine grapes have a pH of 3.3 and Brix of 20, after going through that formula they will have a finally number of 217.80 which is well within an acceptable harvest range for some winemakers.|$|E
2500|$|Texas hold 'em {{is often}} {{associated}} with poker tournaments largely because it is played as the main event in many of the famous tournaments, including the World Series of Poker's Main Event, and is the most common tournament overall. Traditionally, a poker tournament is played with chips that represent a player's stake in the tournament. Standard play allows all entrants to [...] "buy-in" [...] for a fixed amount and all players begin with an equal value of chips. Play proceeds until one player has accumulated all the chips in play or a deal is made among the remaining players to [...] "chop" [...] the remaining prize pool. The money pool is redistributed to the players in relation to the place they finished in the tournament. Only {{a small percentage of the}} players receive any money, with the majority receiving nothing. [...] "The percentages are not standardized, but common rules of thumb call for one table" [...] (usually nine players) [...] "to get paid for each 100 entrants," [...] according to poker author Andrew Glazer, in his book, The Complete Idiot's Guide to Poker. A <b>good</b> <b>rule</b> of thumb is that close to 10% of players will be paid in a tournament. As a result, the strategy in poker tournaments can be very different from a cash game.|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates {{what the}} correct {{justification}} in principle for the <b>good</b> consideration <b>rule</b> is. It {{concludes that the}} answer to that enquiry lies within the elements that complete a cause of action in unjust enrichment. On the best interpretation, the <b>good</b> consideration <b>rule</b> is an enrichment qualification. The defendant’s prima facie enrichment through the receipt of a benefit is balanced off by the discharge of an obligation owed to the defendant. In net terms therefore, the defendant is not enriched. However, this reasoning is conditional on the acceptance of two prior premises. First, the <b>good</b> consideration <b>rule</b> and the legal obligation qualification are distinct restrictions on claims in unjust enrichment. Two features in particular distinguish them: (a) the operation of a legal obligation between the claimant and the defendant; (b) the fact that the payment was intended to discharge a debt owed to the defendant. This thesis concerns the <b>good</b> consideration <b>rule</b> alone. Secondly, in evaluating the defendant’s enrichment, conditionally related disenrichments must be accounted for (the ‘net benefit approach’). Thus, when the defendant receives a benefit on the condition shared between the parties that the defendant will in turn suffer a disenrichment, the defendant’s true enrichment is the difference between those values. At first blush, {{there are at least three}} major objections to the enrichment thesis — the decision of the High Court of Australia in Roxborough, the House of Lords’ decision in Deutsche Morgan and the law on restitution of mistaken payments made to discharge unenforceable debts. On closer examination however, all three can be overcome. Finally, the enrichment thesis fares better than its rival explanations in accounting for the features of the <b>good</b> consideration <b>rule.</b> The ensuing doctrinal consequences are also largely in line with the prevalent judicial and academic thinking on the <b>good</b> consideration <b>rule.</b> This thesis is not currently available on ORA...|$|R

The construction is particularly useful if the components of the integrand are ordered, {{in the sense that the}} first component is more important than the second, and so on. ...|$|R
