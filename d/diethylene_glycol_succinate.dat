40|$|A {{number of}} nonamino organic acids {{associated}} with inborn errors of me-tabolism {{can be detected}} by gas chromatography. The organic acids are extracted into ethyl acetate and diethyl ether, the extracts combined, and the solvents evaporated under nitrogen. The residue is taken up in carbon disulfide and an aliquot chromatographed on 5 % neopentyl glycol adipate to separate short-chain fatty acids (C 2 to 6). The remainingcarbon disulfide is evaporated, the residue taken up in methanol, and the acids are methyl-ated with diazomethane. The solvent is evaporated, the residue taken up in tetrahydrofuian, and an aliquot chromatographed on 15 % <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>succinate</b> to separate keto, hydroxy, and dicarboxylic acids. Chromato-graphic patterns for normal and abnormal urines have been established. Four cases of congenital methylmalonic aciduria have been diagnosed by this procedure.

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 The lipid {{composition}} of swine {{is characteristic of}} the species and is also a reflection of their dietary history. Other investigators have established that the physical properties and {{composition of}} swine depot fat may be altered by variation of the dietary lipid. Dietary regimens employing vegetable oil-bearing materials and their effect on meat quality has received the attention of animal nutritionists for a considerable period. Less {{is known about the}} nutritive value of the more highly unsaturated lipids, such as fish oils, and their effect on the lipid composition of swine tissues. Even less is known about the fate of oxidized fish oil lipids in swine rations. This research had for its purpose the investigation of the fate in swine of the dietary marine lipid, menhaden oil, and its effect on composition of depot lipids. The state of autoxidation of the oil and the effect of certain antioxidants on the fatty acid composition of swine was determined. Growth studies on swine were made using menhaden oil of various oxidation states as the dietary lipid. The effect of antioxidants, ∝-tocopherol acetate and ethoxyquin, was also investigated. At the conclusion of the diet trials, tissue samples, representing the five dietary regimens, were removed for analysis. The fatty tissues examined were outer back fat, inner back fat, and kidney fat. Samples of liver tissue for lipid analysis were also taken. The lipids from the respective tissues were extracted and interesterified with methanol to yield the methyl esters of the fatty acids. Hydrogenation of the unsaturated methyl esters for chain length confirmation was carried out. Qualitative and quantitative gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of the unhydrogenated and hydrogenated methyl esters of the fatty acids were performed on <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>succinate</b> column. The results of these investigations showed that a particular dietary fatty acid can be selectively deposited in animal tissues. Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids of menhaden oil, such as 20 : 5, 22 : 5, 22 : 6 were sparsely deposited in adipose tissues. The depot fat composition showed a mixture of characteristic menhaden oil fatty acids with the typical fat synthesized by swine. Fatty acid composition of tissue from swine fed oxidized menhaden oil with and without antioxidants showed very similar fatty acid composition as those fed fresh menhaden oil. The results of this investigation supported the beneficial effect of vitamin E (∝-tocopherol acetate) and ethoxyquin as in vivo antioxidants...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Diethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> (DEG) is the {{by-product}} of the hydration of ethylene oxide.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 The {{variation}} in fatty acid composition between the "bound" and "free" lipid in stored anchovy meal was determined using gas-liquid chromatographic analysis. A model system of fresh anchovy oil on powdered lactalbumin was also studied {{to determine the}} changes in extractability and fatty acid composition which occur during oxidation. All of the lipid-protein systems examined were first extracted with hexane. The extracted protein was then extracted with choroform:: methanol (2 : 1 v/v), and finally digested in HCl and the hydrolysate extracted with diethyl ether. The chloroform : methanol extract and HCl digestion represented oil which was bound to the protein. Each lipid extract was interesterified with methanol to yield the corresponding methyl esters, and these esters were then analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. Both quantitative and qualitative analysis was carried out using a <b>diethylene</b> <b>glycol</b> <b>succinate</b> packed column in a gas chromatograph equipped with a hydrogen flame detector. The results of these investigations showed that the oil from anchovy meal differed markedly in fatty acid composition from the corresponding fresh oil. Although the types of fatty acids found were identical {{to those in the}} fresh oil, there was considerable quantitative variation. These differences were characterized by smaller amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the meal, and correspondingly larger amounts of saturated and monoenoic fatty acids. The greatest change occurred in the acid, 20 : 5. Anchovy meal contained a "bound" lipid fraction which varied in quantitative fatty acid composition with the readily extractable lipid. The fractions associated with the protein had higher proportions of 22 : 4, 22 : 5, and 22 : 6, with the acid digest fraction considerably lower in the monoenoic fatty acids. The oxidation of anchovy oil and anchovy oil methyl esters on lactalbumin produced a reduction in hexane extractable lipid with a corresponding increase in lipid which was soluble only in chloroform : methanol or after HCl hydrolysis. These changes were more drastic when untreated anchovy oil was used. The oxidation of anchovy oil methyl esters on lactalbumin produced a reduction in the amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids present in the hexane extract. The other solvent extractions, however, yielded only higher molecular weight compounds which could not be analyzed by GLC. These observations led {{to the conclusion that the}} fatty acids formed compounds which interacted before being bound to the protein...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The {{volatile}} flavor {{fraction of}} lightly milled wheat grown in eastern Oregon was isolated for study by two methods: steam distillation under vacuum and steam distillation at atmospheric pressure. The sample obtained under vacuum was extracted with ether {{which was then}} evaporated to yield the desired wheat essence. Steam distillation at atmospheric pressure provided the headspace vapors that were used {{for a portion of}} the gas chromatographic analysis. Identification of the organic substances contained in the volatile flavor fraction was {{made on the basis of}} chemical tests, paper chromatography, gas-liquid chromatography, and mass spectrometry. Preliminary testing for amines and carbonyls indicated the presence of both of these functional groups, although in subsequent research amines were not detected. Additional information as to the functional groups present was obtained by subjecting headspace vapor samples to gas chromatography and directing the column effluent into vials containing reagents selected to indicate the presence of alcohols, amines, esters, carbonyls, and mercaptans. A separate set of reagents was used for each eluting peak. Formation of 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazone derivatives and determination of their melting points provided one means of tentative identification of carbonyl compounds. Ascending paper chromatography was used to separate the 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazone derivatives of the carbonyls into classes and to ultimately assist in the identification of these compounds. A Barber-Colman gas-liquid chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector was used as a means of separating the components in the samples. Identification of some of the compounds was possible through comparisons of retention times of the peaks on these columns with retention times of known compounds. Column packings used for gas-liquid chromatography were six percent Apiezon M, six percent <b>Diethylene</b> <b>Glycol</b> <b>Succinate,</b> and three percent Free Fatty Acid Phase, all on a solid support of Anakrom ABS, 90 to 100 mesh. The column was heated isothermally at 75 °C with nitrogen as the carrier gas flowing at a pressure of five pounds per square inch. Mass spectra of the wheat essence compounds were obtained by use of an Atlas-MAT Ch- 4 mass spectrometer using a two second scan, coupled with a gas-liquid chromatograph. Twelve compounds were identified and six were tentatively identified in the headspace aroma or in the wheat flavor essence. Those identified were acetaldehyde, isobutyraldehyde, butyraldehyde, valeraldehyde, hexanal, heptanal, octanal, crotonaldehyde, 3 -methyl- 2 -butanone, 2, 2 -dimethyl- 3 -pentanone, diacetyl, and ethyl acetate. The compounds tentatively identified included isoamyl alcohol, amyl alcohol, butanone, isovaleraldehyde, cyclopentanone, and phenylacetaldehyde...|$|E
