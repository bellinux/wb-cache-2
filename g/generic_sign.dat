40|$|The Fermi sign {{structure}} plays {{a crucial}} role for a Landau's Fermi liquid. In this work, we identify the exact sign structure for the bipartite Hubbard model at an arbitrary strength of the on-site Coulomb repulsion $U$. This general sign structure naturally reproduces the conventional fermion signs in the small $U$ limit, and the phase string signs of the $t$-$J$ model in the large $U$ limit. We focus on the half-filling case as an example to illustrate why such a <b>generic</b> <b>sign</b> structure is important to understand the transition from the weakly correlated Fermi liquid regime to the strongly correlated Mott regime. In particular, we show that an electron fractionalization scheme with emergent partons and mutual Chern-Simons gauge fields provides a suitable framework to accurately handle the singular sign structure in two dimensions. A ground state ansatz at half-filling with incorporating the sign structure and the specific electron fractionalization is also proposed.

40|$|The {{motivation}} {{for this research}} is to leverage the increasing deployment of the phasor measurement unit (PMU) technology by electric utilities {{in order to improve}} situational awareness in power systems. PMUs provide unprecedentedly fast and synchronized voltage and current measurements across the system. Analyzing the big data provided by PMUs may prove helpful in reducing the risk of blackouts, such as the Northeast blackout in August 2003, which have resulted in huge costs in past decades. In order to provide deeper insight into early warning signs (EWS) of catastrophic events in power systems, this dissertation studies changes in statistical properties of high-resolution measurements as a power system approaches a critical transition. The EWS under study are increases in variance and autocorrelation of state variables, which are <b>generic</b> <b>signs</b> of a phenomenon known as critical slowing down (CSD). Critical slowing down is the result of slower recovery of a dynamical system from perturbations when the system approaches a critical transition. CSD has been observed in many stochastic nonlinear dynamical systems such as ecosystem, human body and power system. Although CSD signs can be useful as indicators of proximity to critical transitions, their characteristics vary for different systems and different variables within a system. The dissertation provides evidence for the occurrence of CSD in power systems using a comprehensive analytical and numerical study of this phenomenon in several power system test cases. Together, the results show that it is possible extract information regarding not only the proximity of a power system to critical transitions but also the location of the stress in the system from autocorrelation and variance of measurements. Also, a semi-analytical method for fast computation of expected variance and autocorrelation of state variables in large power systems is presented, which allows one to quickly identify locations and variables that are reliable indicators of proximity to instability...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Dilatation of {{the fetal}} {{cerebral}} ventricles (ventriculomegaly) is a <b>generic</b> sonographic <b>sign,</b> which {{is common to}} several pathological entities carrying different prognosis. Ventriculomegaly is easily recognized by ultrasound by measuring the atrial width. This simple measure allows the recognition of even mild forms of ventricular dilatation and {{is used as a}} screening method for ventriculomegaly. However, although the diagnosis of ventriculomegaly is easy, the prenatal identification of the cause of ventricular dilatation is a more difficult task. The recognition of associated brain anomalies is a crucial point. The research of the cause of ventriculomegaly is clinically useful, since the prognosis mainly depends on the etiology and on the presence of associated abnormalities. In this article the role of prenatal sonography in recognizing the cause of the ventriculomegaly is reviewed...|$|R

Vehicles attempting to turn across the opposing direction of traffic (left in right-hand drive jurisdictions; right in left-hand drive jurisdictions) cross before they enter the intersection. No left turn signal in the intersection is then necessary. Instead, vehicles traveling in both directions can proceed, including through vehicles and those turning right or left, when a <b>generic</b> traffic signal/stop <b>sign</b> permits.|$|R

40|$|Dilatation of {{the fetal}} {{cerebral}} ventricles (ventriculomegaly) is a <b>generic</b> sonographic <b>sign</b> common to several pathological entities carrying different prognoses. The main causes of fetal ventriculomegaly are aqueductal stenosis, Chiari II malformation, Dandy-Walker complex and agenesis of the corpus callosum. Ventriculomegaly is easily recognized by ultrasound {{by measuring the}} atrial width. This simple measure allows the recognition of mild forms of ventricular dilatation and {{is used as a}} screening method for ventriculomegaly. However, although the diagnosis of ventriculomegaly is easy, the prenatal identification of the cause of ventricular dilatation is a more difficult task. To this end, the evaluation of the posterior fossa in association with the visualization of the corpus callosum is a useful landmark.

40|$|Traffic Sign Recognition is {{a widely}} studied problem and its dynamic nature calls for the {{application}} of a broad range of preprocessing, segmentation, and recognition techniques but few databases are available for evaluation. We have produced a database consisting of 1, 300 images captured by a video camera. On this database we have conducted a systematic experimental study. We used four different preprocessing techniques and designed a <b>generic</b> speed <b>sign</b> segmentation algorithm. Then we selected a range of contemporary speed sign classification algorithms using shape based segmented binary images for training and evaluated their results using four metrics, including accuracy and processing speed. The results indicate that Naive Bayes and Random Forest seem particularly well suited for this recognition task. Moreover, we show that two specific preprocessing techniques appear to provide a better basis for concept learning than the others.

40|$|There {{have been}} {{significant}} {{recent advances in}} our understanding of the potential use and limitations of early-warning signs for predicting drastic changes, so called critical transitions or tipping points, in dynamical systems. A focus of mathematical modeling and analysis has been on stochastic ordinary differential equations, where <b>generic</b> statistical early-warning <b>signs</b> can be identified near bifurcation-induced tipping points. In this paper, we outline some basic steps to extend this theory to stochastic partial differential equations with a focus on analytically characterizing basic scaling laws for linear SPDEs and comparing the results to numerical simulations of fully nonlinear problems. In particular, we study stochastic versions of the Swift-Hohenberg and Ginzburg-Landau equations. We derive a scaling law of the covariance operator in a regime where linearization {{is expected to be a}} good approximation for the local fluctuations around deterministic steady states. We compare these results to direct numerical simulation, and study the influence of noise level, noise color, distance to bifurcation and domain size on early-warning signs.
