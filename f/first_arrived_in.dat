5|$|The Portuguese <b>first</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> Timor in the 16th century, and in 1702 East Timor {{came under}} Portuguese colonial administration. Portuguese rule was tenuous until {{the island was}} divided with the Dutch Empire in 1860. A {{significant}} battleground during the Pacific War, East Timor was occupied by 20,000 Japanese troops. The fighting helped prevent a Japanese occupation of Australia, but resulted in 60,000 East Timorese deaths.|$|E
5|$|The only {{primates}} {{that live}} in Canada are humans. The species originated in east Africa and is unrelated to South American primates. Humans <b>first</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> large numbers to Canada around 15,000 years ago from North Asia, and surged in migration starting 400 years ago from around the world, especially from Europe.|$|E
5|$|Ethnic Malays {{which make}} up the {{majority}} population of Malaysia at 50.4%, are an ethnic group of Austronesian people predominantly inhabiting the Malay Peninsula, including the southernmost parts of Thailand, {{the east coast of}} Sumatra, the coast of Borneo, and the smaller islands which lie between these locations. The true origin of ethnic Malays is still the subject of studies among historians, anthropologists and linguists. A popular theory suggested that the people who spoke Austronesian languages <b>first</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> Maritime Southeast Asia between 2,500BCE and 1,500BCE, as a part of Austronesian expansion from Taiwan to South East Asia.|$|E

5|$|Red maple is {{far more}} {{abundant}} today than when Europeans <b>first</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> North America, where along with its cousin Silver Maple, it may have comprised a mere 5% of forest area and was confined mostly to riparian zones. The density of the tree {{in many of these}} areas has increased 6 to 7 fold and this trend seems to be continuing, much of it due to human factors, especially suppression of wildfires which would kill shallow-rooted pioneer species like red maple, but leave mainline forest trees like oaks and hickories untouched.|$|E
5|$|Roaring Creek was {{historically}} {{known as}} Popemetang, {{but it was}} known as Roaring Creek by the late 1700s. Settlers such as Quakers <b>first</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> {{the area in the}} 1770s. In the 19th century, various mills and furnaces were constructed on the creek and several bridges were constructed. Agriculture was also a major industry in the watershed in the early 20th century. More bridges were constructed across the creek in the 20th century. The Roaring Creek Valley Conservation Association formed in February 2006. Part of the creek is navigable by canoe.|$|E
5|$|The Bay Area {{has been}} {{inhabited}} since antiquity, {{first by the}} Ohlone and Miwok peoples, followed by the Spanish, who <b>first</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> 1769 and established the area's first mission, Mission San Francisco de Asís, in 1776. After being ceded to the United States in 1848, the Bay Area grew immensely due to the California Gold Rush, establishing itself {{as one of the}} most important regions on the West Coast. Today, the Bay Area is the home of Silicon Valley, Wine Country, and numerous companies, universities, bridges, airports, and parks.|$|E

5|$|The Normans <b>first</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> Southern Italy in 1015 from {{northern}} France and served local Lombard lords as mercenaries against the Byzantine Empire. As {{they were paid}} with lands, soon they were powerful enough to challenge Papal authority; in 1054, they defeated the Pope at the Battle of Civitate, forcing him to acknowledge their authority. In 1059, the Pope made Robert Guiscard, of the Hauteville family, Duke of Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily. However, most of Apulia and Calabria were in Byzantine hands, and Sicily was in Saracen hands.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{probably}} obtained spotted horses through {{trade with}} southern Austria and Hungary, where the color pattern {{was known to}} exist. The Conquistadors and Spanish settlers then brought some vividly marked horses to the Americas when they <b>first</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> the early 16th century. One horse with snowflake patterning was listed with the 16 horses brought to Mexico by Cortez, and additional spotted horses were mentioned by Spanish writers by 1604. Others arrived {{in the western hemisphere}} when spotted horses went out of style in late 18th-century Europe, and were shipped to Mexico, California and Oregon.|$|E
5|$|The {{land that}} became Sullivan County was {{originally}} part of Northumberland County, then {{became part of}} Lycoming County when it was formed in 1795. Settlers <b>first</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> the park's townships in 1794. Shrewsbury Township was formed from Muncy Township in 1803, and Forks Township was formed from Shrewsbury Township in 1833, both while still part of Lycoming County. Sullivan County was formed from the northeastern part of Lycoming County on March 15, 1847.|$|E

5|$|There are {{at least}} two major rock {{formations}} in the watershed of Little Fishing Creek: the Chemung Formation and the Hamilton Group. The creek's watershed includes part of the Greenwood Valley. Much of the watershed is forested and major roads in it include Pennsylvania Route 42. The first European settler <b>first</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> the vicinity of the creek during the 1760s or 1770s, with other settlers arriving in the 1790s. A number of sawmills, woolen mills, and tanneries historically operated on the creek. A number of covered bridges have also been built over it and there were historically some railroads in the watershed.|$|E
5|$|A British {{campaign}} to invade Arochukwu {{and open up}} the hinterland for British military and political rule {{was carried out in}} 1901. A war between the British and Aro officially started on 1 December 1901 lasting till 24 March 1902 when the Aro were defeated. The Aro Confederacy ended and the rest of Aro dominated areas was added to The Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria, declared in 1900. Europeans <b>first</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> the Enugu area in 1903 when the British/Australian geologist Albert Ernest Kitson led an exploration of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate to search for especially valued mineral resources {{under the supervision of the}} Imperial Institute, London. By 1909 coal was found under the village of Enugwu Ngwo in the Udi and Okoga areas and by 1913 the coal was confirmed to be in quantities that would be viable commercially. By 1914 the colonial government had already merged the Northern and Southern Nigeria Protectorate to form the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|Before the Spanish conquest, Chiapas was {{inhabited}} {{by a variety}} of indigenous peoples, including the Zoques, various Maya peoples, such as the Lakandon Ch'ol and the Tzotzil, and an unidentified group referred to as the Chiapanecas. Soconusco had been incorporated into the Aztec Empire, centred in Valley of Mexico, and paid the Aztecs tribute. News of strangers <b>first</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> the region as the Spanish penetrated and overthrew the Aztec Empire. In the early 1520s, several Spanish expeditions crossed Chiapas by land, and Spanish ships scouted the Pacific coast. The first highland colonial town in Chiapas, San Cristóbal de los Llanos, was established by Pedro de Portocarrero in 1527. Within a year, Spanish dominion extended over the upper drainage basin of the Grijalva River, Comitán, and the Ocosingo valley. Encomienda rights were established, although in the earlier stages of conquest these amounted to little more than slave-raiding rights.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th {{century the}} town was part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland. During World War I the region was {{captured}} by the German Empire, which intended to incorporate the area into its province of East Prussia. After the German defeat, the victorious Entente was willing to assign the territory to either the newly independent Poland or Lithuania. The future of the region was discussed at the Paris Peace Conference in January 1919. The Germans, whose former Ober-Ost administration was preparing to evacuate, initially supported leaving the area to a Polish administration. However, as Poland was becoming an ally of France, German support gradually shifted towards Lithuania. In July 1919, when the German troops began their slow retreat from the area, they delegated the administration to local Lithuanian authorities. Lithuanian officers and troops, who <b>first</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> the region in May, began to organize military units in the pre-war Sejny county.|$|E
5|$|Enderlin's France2 report {{placed the}} {{shooting}} {{later in the}} day. His voiceover said that Jamal and Muhammad were shot around 3:00pm local time (GMT+3). James Fallows agreed that Jamal and Muhammad first made an appearance in the footage around 3:00pm, judging by comments from Jamal and some journalists on the scene. Abu Rahma said he remained at the junction for 30–40 minutes after the shooting. According to Schapira, he left for his studio in Gaza at around 4 pm, where he sent the footage to Enderlin in Jerusalem at around 6 pm. The news <b>first</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> London from the Associated Press at 6:00 pm BST (GMT+1), followed minutes later by a similar report from Reuters.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} that European {{settlers}} <b>first</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> South Africa in 1652, the country was divided on racial lines, in common with similar settlements. In contrast to other European colonies, racial distinction and segregation intensified during the early 20th century, and the various ethnic groups became more sharply defined and divided. Following its general election victory in 1948, the National Party, led by Daniel Malan, formalised this racism under a government policy called apartheid. Under apartheid, different races were kept apart {{in all aspects of}} life. This system was thoroughly enforced during the 1950s; any resistance from non-white races was put down and laws, supposedly to prevent the rise of communism, were passed to prevent political agitation.|$|E

5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in the Big Butte Creek area for at least 8,000 years. The Klamath, Upper Umpqua, Takelma, and Latgawa tribes of Native Americans {{inhabited}} the watershed until they were driven out in the Rogue River Wars of the 1850s. On Christmas Eve, December 24, 1855, Captain E. A. Rice along with 34 other men attacked a Native American encampment near the creek's mouth. Eighteen Native American men were killed, all the women and children were captured, and the camp was burned to the ground. Most were relocated to Indian reservations. Non-indigenous settlers <b>first</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> the early 1860s, and agriculture, ranching, and logging industries quickly developed. Big Butte Creek was named by early settlers for its close proximity to Mount McLoughlin (also known as Snowy Butte), as was nearby Little Butte Creek.|$|E
5|$|In 1836, native Vermonter John Deere set {{out from}} Rutland, Vermont to Grand Detour, Illinois, founded by his friend and fellow Vermont native Leonard Andrus. The town lacked a local blacksmith, Deere's trade, and within two days Deere had a forge and new {{business}} established. In Vermont, Deere produced plows made from cast-iron and when he <b>first</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> Illinois he produced the same plows. Soil conditions in Illinois differ from those in Vermont. In Vermont the soil is sandy and falls easily away from the plow blade but in Illinois the soil is thicker and wetter; it stuck to the plow {{and had to be}} scraped off by the farmer as he plowed.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not certain}} whether the year of Hamilton's birth was 1755 or 1757. Most {{historical}} evidence after Hamilton's arrival in North America supports {{the idea that he}} was born in 1757, including Hamilton's own writings. Hamilton listed his birth year as 1757 when he <b>first</b> <b>arrived</b> <b>in</b> the Thirteen Colonies, and celebrated his birthday on January 11. In later life, he tended to give his age only in round figures. Historians accepted 1757 as his birth year until about 1930, when additional documentation of his early life in the Caribbean was published, initially in Danish. A probate paper from St. Croix in 1768, drafted after the death of Hamilton's mother, listed him as 13 years old, which has caused some historians since the 1930s to favor a birth year of 1755.|$|E
