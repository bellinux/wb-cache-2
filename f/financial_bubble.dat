25|$|An {{economic}} bubble or asset bubble (sometimes {{also referred to}} as a speculative bubble, a market bubble, a price bubble, a <b>financial</b> <b>bubble,</b> a speculative mania, or a balloon) is trade in an asset at a price or price range that strongly exceeds the asset's intrinsic value. though theories of financial crises such as debt-deflation and the Financial Instability Hypothesis suggest instead that bubbles burst progressively, with the most vulnerable (most highly-leveraged) assets failing first, and then the collapse spreading throughout the economy.|$|E
25|$|During the 1920s, {{the nation}} enjoyed {{widespread}} prosperity, albeit with a weakness in agriculture. A <b>financial</b> <b>bubble</b> {{was fueled by}} an inflated stock market, which later led to the Stock Market Crash on October 29, 1929. This, {{along with many other}} economic factors, triggered a worldwide depression known as the Great Depression. During this time, the United States experienced deflation as prices fell, unemployment soared from 3% in 1929 to 25% in 1933, farm prices fell by half, and manufacturing output plunged by one-third.|$|E
25|$|Sweden {{has had an}} {{economic}} model in the post-World War II era, characterized by close cooperation between the government, labour unions, and corporations. The Swedish economy has extensive and universal social benefits funded by high taxes, close to 50% of GDP. In the 1980s, a real estate and <b>financial</b> <b>bubble</b> formed, driven by a rapid increase in lending. A restructuring of the tax system, in order to emphasize low inflation combined with an international economic slowdown in the early 1990s, caused the bubble to burst. Between 1990 and 1993 GDP went down by 5% and unemployment skyrocketed, causing the worst economic crisis in Sweden since the 1930s. According to an analysis published in Computer Sweden in 1992, the investment level decreased drastically for information technology and computing equipment, except in the financial and banking sector, {{the part of the}} industry that created the crisis. The investment levels for IT and computers were restored as early as 1993. In 1992 there was a run on the currency, the central bank briefly jacking up interest to 500% in an unsuccessful effort to defend the currency's fixed exchange rate. Total employment fell by almost 10% during the crisis.|$|E

2500|$|Minnesota's fraternities and sororities {{built up}} their housing {{prospects}} in three distinct phases, {{according to the}} 2003 Minneapolis Historical Commission Study. Before 1900, most early chapters served their membership with rented private homes. Between 1900 and 1917, rentals gave way to properties built for the chapters, resulting in several iconic examples of Beaux Arts, Georgian and Classical styles. Finally, between 1921 and 1936, Minnesota's fraternity chapters engaged in that same popular building spree which was sweeping across other early private and land grant colleges and universities from New York to California. The result of this last phase was the often stately homes occupied by many Greek chapters today, upgrades from boarding house-style clapboard and stucco homes, to the many Fraternity Row mansions that are visible at Minnesota along University Avenue SE, on 4th and 5th Street SE, and the 10th Avenue [...] "Sorority Row," [...] all in Minneapolis. Similarly, the St. Paul campus is home to several stately chapter buildings, or chapterhouses, along Cleveland Avenue. It {{is a testament to}} the alumni of many of these chapters that their buildings survived, as so many were financed by the 1920s <b>financial</b> <b>bubble,</b> having endured weak membership eras during the Great Depression and then the twin turmoils of WWII and 1960s anti-establishment unrest. , now digitally available, often picture these buildings, some with addresses and photos or professionally crafted etchings.

He had the full account in the newspaper, and had begun reading it, when my father uttered a low moan and tumbled off his chair to the floor.|$|E
