40|$|Population in {{developed}} countries has dramatically aged in recent years. At the same time, most of these countries finance their old - age public pension benefits on a pay - as - you - go (PAYGO) basis. Such a pension scheme combined with an ageing population, represent a financial challenge for t he governmental budgets. Accordingly, several <b>studies</b> <b>ha</b> <b>ve</b> <b>been</b> done {{on the effects of}} pop u l a - tion ageing. In the present paper, the purpose <b>is</b> to <b>study</b> how population ageing will affect ca p ital accumulation. A simple OLG model with PAYGO pension is applied. The formulation of the model makes it possible to deduce an explicit expression for this relation. It is shown that an i n crea se in the elderly dependency ratio will increase the long - run capital stoc...|$|R
