All tests were with nonirradiated metal pending acquisition of irradiated samples. Installation is nearly complete of a glovebox facility for studies on the salvage of alpha-contaminated metals by pyrochemical methods. Disposal of a major portion of <b>fission</b> <b>product</b> <b>tritium</b> formed in light water reactor fuels by deep- well injection of the low-level aqueous waste from plants reprocessing such fuels is being evaluated. The question of siting is a very important factor in determining the feasibility of this particular disposal option. A review is given of the status of information for U. S. sedimentary basins, the areas most likely to be generally suitable for siting of waste wells. Work on the reliability of high-level-waste canisters included an examination of creep, shot- peening, and subcooling of the filler canister below storage temperatures, as methods of relieving stresses induced in canisters due to differential contraction of canister and glass during cooling. A method was investigated for relieving stresses in calcine-filled canisters.

40|$|The {{locations}} and the chemical forms (chemical bonds) of radionuclides in neutron-irradiated nuclear graphite have been determined {{in order to}} develop principal strategies for the management of graphitic nuclear waste. Due to the relatively low concentration of radionuclides in neutron-irradiated nuclear graphite (< 1 ppm) direct spectroscopic methods are not applicable to investigate chemical structures. Therefore, methods by analogy have been applied. Such methods are investigations of the chemically detectable precursors of radionuclides in neutron-irradiated nuclear graphite and subjection of irradiated graphite to different chemical reactions followed by measurements of the radionuclide-containing reaction products by sensitive radiochemical methods. The paper discusses the applicability of these methods. The radionuclides investigated in this study can be divided into three parts: tritium, radiocarbon and metallic activation and <b>fission</b> <b>products.</b> <b>Tritium</b> can be bound in neutron-irradiated nuclear graphite as strongly adsorbed tritiated water (HTO), in oxygen-containing functional groups (e. g. C–OT) and as hydrocarbons (C–T). Radiocarbon is covalently bound with the graphite structure. The activity can be described by a homogeneously distributed part and a heterogeneously distributed part (enriched on surfaces or in hotspots). Metallic radionuclides can be bound as ions or covalent metal–carbon compounds. The distribution of all these radionuclides is mainly dependent on the distribution of their inactive precursors...|$|R
