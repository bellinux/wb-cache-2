Radiation leakage from microwave oven may be harmful for users. Ladies have {{the highest levels of}} contact with microwave ovens. This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of radiation leakage from microwave oven on body weight, cortisol and thyroid hormones. Methods: Radiation leakage of microwave oven was measured by RF measuring instrument. For this study, 20 adult two-month-old female mice weighing 25 - 28 g were randomly divided in control and test groups. Test group was exposed to 2450 MHZ microwaves produced by a microwave oven 3 times a day, 30 minutes each time. After 60 days, body weights of both groups were determined and blood was collected by heart puncture. Cortisol and thyroid levels were evaluated in serum by an RIA method. Results: radiation leakage <b>from</b> <b>oven</b> showed variation and ranged from 6. 5 to 57. 5 mW/cm 2. Mean body weight changes in test and control groups were 0 and 4. 54 grams, respectively. Cortisol (23. 6 ± 2. 24 vs. 13. 6 ± 1. 47 ng/ml) and T 4 (98. 4 ± 7. 3 vs. 67. 0 ± 5. 9 nmol/L) levels were significantly increased in the test group compared to the control group, respectively. Level of T 3 did not alter significantly. Conclusion: We found that microwaves leaked <b>from</b> <b>oven</b> decrease body weight and increase T 4 and cortisol levels, and therefore have deleterious health effects...|$|E

The percent ground cover by the forest floor (coarse woody debris and litter (< 10  cm diameter)) was measured using a transect grid of 400 points over {{three of the four}} plots. Litter (LFH; a combination of fresh litter (L), and partly and well-decomposed litter (FH) all < 10  cm diameter) and soil chemistry samples were collected before spray application and then at 15, 30, 79 and 163  days after spray application. The litter was collected at four random points per plot using a 0.1 -m 2 sampling square and bulked per plot to form one composite sample. Soil samples were collected from 30 random points for 0 – 10 cm and 10 – 50 cm depths and at 10 of those points for 50 – 100 cm depth using a 25 - mm diameter stainless steel Hoffer tube sampler and bulked for analysis at the plot level per depth. Two soil bulk density cores were collected for 0 – 10  cm and bulked per plot, and one soil core was collected for the deeper soil (10 – 20, 50 – 100  cm) at one random location within each plot using a 10  cm diameter[*]×[*] 10  cm length steel core.

40|$|At {{the present}} time there is a {{recognized}} need for a better means of measuring soil moisture in situ. Soil moisture measurements are required in fundamental studies of soil moisture flow and soil-plant-water relationships {{as well as in}} practical studies in irrigation practices. Various phases of engineering also utilize soil moisture data, for example, soil moisture determinations are made during the consturction of earth dams, road cuts and fills, and under airfield runways. The desired method should be quick, reliable, and adaptable over the moisture range <b>from</b> <b>oven</b> dryness to saturation. Reserach in nuclear physics has revealed the neutron scattering phenomena which may be utilized as a means of determining soil moisture. It is known that hydrogen nuclei have a large influence on the scattering of neutrons and that most of the hydrogen nuclei in soils occur primarily in water. Using this information {{it should be possible to}} correlate the scattering of neutrons in the soil with moisture content. Measurement of soil water in this would be independent of its physical or chemical state in the soil. This would eliminate variables that are inherent in the present methods, such as temperature, soil texture, and salt concentrations. The obejct of this study is to adapt the neutron scattering phenomena to a method of soil moisture determination in situ. The problem is one of instrumentation and calibration. The emphasis will be toward developing an instrument to be used for soil moisture determination in experimental plots. Other diverse applications will also be considered.

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 Research was {{initiated}} at the Squaw Butte Experimental Range in southeastern Oregon {{to study the}} influence of crested wheatgrass (Agropyron desertorum (Fisch.) Schult.) herbage availability on relative dry matter intake (DMI) of yearling steers. Herbage dry matter production on an 18 ha range and daily fecal production of yearling steers were measured during April, May and June of 1970 and 1971. Herbage production was estimated <b>from</b> <b>oven</b> dry samples obtained by clipping plots to ground level during eight trials in 1970 and four trials in 1971. Total fecal production, determined from steers equipped with fecal collection harnesses and bags, {{was used as an}} index of relative DMI. Dry matter digestibility (DMD) of the herbage was assumed to remain constant with advance in season. The validity of this assumption was checked using three methods to estimate DMD: in vitro digestion plus pepsin (IVP), lignin ratio (LR) and in vitro digestion of cell wall constituents (TD). Dietary samples were collected from esophageally fistulated steers in 1971 to consider the influence of selectivity on DMD estimates. Dry matter digestibility estimates from clipped and dietary samples were significantly different (P < 0. 01) within all trials. Because DMD estimated from the three methods did not remain constant, quantified estimates of DMI were calculated using the fecal production to indigestibility ratio. Although no direct comparisons were made, estimates of DMI from TD were consistently lower than DMI estimated from IVP or LR; but, all methods of estimating DMD showed the same relative influence of herbage availability on DMI of grazing steers. Dry matter intake was not limited when herbage availability equaled or exceeded 135 or 176 kg/ha during 1970 and 1971, respectively...|$|E

40|$|The {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) {{data structure}} generated under a high resolution GC×GC {{system with a}} small number of samplings taken across the first dimension is evaluated for the purpose of the application of chemometric deconvolution methods. Chemometric techniques such as generalized rank annihilation method (GRAM) place high demands on the reproducibility of chromatographic experiments. For GRAM to be employed for GC×GC data interpretation, it is critical that the separation method provides data with a bilinear structure; the peak-shape and retention times on both columns must be reproducible. With a limited number of samplings across a 1 D (first dimension) peak (e. g. four to six samplings) repeatability of the pattern of the modulated peaks (controlled by the modulation phase) becomes important in producing a bilinear data structure. Reproducibility of modulation phase can be affected by both reliability of the modulation period and reproducibility of the retention time of the peak on the first column (which arises <b>from</b> <b>oven</b> temperature and carrier flow rate stability). Evaluation of within-run and run-to-run retention time reproducibility (retention time uncertainty) on both columns, and modulation phase reproducibility using a modulated cryogenic system for a pair of overlapping components (fatty acid methyl esters) was undertaken. An investigation of the quality of data to permit quantification of each component by using GRAM deconvolution, was also conducted. Less than 4 % run-to-run retention time uncertainty was obtained on column 1 and less than 9 % run-to-run and within-run retention time uncertainty was obtained on column 2, where these R. S.
