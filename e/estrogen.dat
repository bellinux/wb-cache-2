5|$|<b>Estrogen</b> {{levels may}} affect thyroid behavior. For example, during the luteal phase (when <b>estrogen</b> levels are lower), the {{velocity}} of blood flow in the thyroid is lower than during the follicular phase (when <b>estrogen</b> levels are higher).|$|E
5|$|Combined {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{include both}} an <b>estrogen</b> and a progestogen. <b>Estrogen</b> negative {{feedback on the}} anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which makes combined hormonal contraceptives more effective at inhibiting follicular development and preventing ovulation. <b>Estrogen</b> also reduces the incidence of irregular breakthrough bleeding. Several combined hormonal contraceptives—the pill, NuvaRing, and the contraceptive patch—are usually used {{in a way that}} causes regular withdrawal bleeding. In a normal cycle, menstruation occurs when <b>estrogen</b> and progesterone levels drop rapidly. Temporarily discontinuing use of combined hormonal contraceptives (a placebo week, not using patch or ring for a week) has a similar effect of causing the uterine lining to shed. If withdrawal bleeding is not desired, combined hormonal contraceptives may be taken continuously, although this increases the risk of breakthrough bleeding.|$|E
5|$|Fear {{response}} in women during two {{different points in}} the menstrual cycle has been examined. When <b>estrogen</b> is highest in the preovulatory stage, women are significantly better at identifying expressions of fear than women who were menstruating, which is when <b>estrogen</b> levels are lowest. The women were equally able to identify happy faces, demonstrating that the fear response was a more powerful response. To summarize, menstrual cycle phase and the <b>estrogen</b> levels correlates with women’s fear processing.|$|E

50|$|Similarly {{to other}} steroidal <b>estrogens,</b> 2-hydroxyestradiol is an antioxidant, but the {{catechol}} <b>estrogens</b> (2- and 4-hydroxylated <b>estrogens)</b> like 2-hydroxyestradiol {{are considered to}} be the most potent in terms of antioxidant activity.|$|R
40|$|<b>Estrogens</b> play a {{major role}} in the biology of hormone-responsive tissues but also in the normal {{physiology}} of various non-typical hormone-responsive tissues. In disease, <b>estrogens</b> have been associated with tumor development, in particular with tumors such as breast, endometrium, ovary and prostate. In this paper we will review the molecular mechanisms by which <b>estrogens</b> are involved in cancer development, with a special focus in Lynch syndrome related neoplasia. Further, we discuss the role <b>estrogens</b> might have on cell proliferation and apoptosis, how <b>estrogens</b> metabolites can induce DNA damage and we discuss a possible connection between <b>estrogens</b> and changes in DNA (hypo- and hyper) methylation. In this review we will also address the protective effect that high levels of <b>estrogens</b> have in MMR related neoplasias. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
5|$|The exact {{mechanism}} of these opposite responses of LH levels to estradiol {{is not well}} understood. In animals, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) surge {{has been shown to}} precede the LH surge, suggesting that estrogen's main effect is on the hypothalamus, which controls GnRH secretion. This may be enabled by the presence of two different <b>estrogen</b> receptors in the hypothalamus: <b>estrogen</b> receptor alpha, which is responsible for the negative feedback estradiol-LH loop, and <b>estrogen</b> receptor beta, which is responsible for the positive estradiol-LH relationship. However, in humans {{it has been shown that}} high levels of estradiol can provoke abrupt increases in LH, even when GnRH levels and pulse frequencies are held constant, suggesting that <b>estrogen</b> acts directly on the pituitary to provoke the LH surge.|$|E
5|$|The proliferative {{phase is}} {{the second phase of}} the uterine cycle when <b>estrogen</b> causes the lining of the uterus to grow, or proliferate, during this time. As they mature, the ovarian follicles secrete {{increasing}} amounts of estradiol, and <b>estrogen.</b> The estrogens initiate the formation of a new layer of endometrium in the uterus, histologically identified as the proliferative endometrium. The <b>estrogen</b> also stimulates crypts in the cervix to produce fertile cervical mucus, which may be noticed by women practicing fertility awareness.|$|E
5|$|After {{menstruation}} {{and directly}} {{under the influence of}} <b>estrogen,</b> the cervix undergoes a series of changes in position and texture. During most of the menstrual cycle, the cervix remains firm, and is positioned low and closed. However, as ovulation approaches, the cervix becomes softer and rises to open in response to the higher levels of <b>estrogen</b> present. These changes are also accompanied by changes in cervical mucus, described below.|$|E
50|$|Similarly to {{estradiol}} and estrone, catechol <b>estrogens</b> possess estrogenic activity. 2-Hydroxylated catechol <b>estrogens</b> {{are weak}} and possibly antiestrogenic <b>estrogens,</b> whereas their 4-hydroxylated counterparts are more potent in their estrogenic activity. For instance, 2-hydroxyestrone reportedly shows negligible uterotrophic effect in animals, whereas 4-hydroxy catechol <b>estrogens</b> show moderate changes in stimulating uterine weight. In {{addition to being}} substrates for COMT similarly to catecholamines like dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, catechol <b>estrogens</b> are potent competitive inhibitors of COMT {{as well as of}} tyrosine hydroxylase, and may affect both catecholamine biosynthesis and metabolism.|$|R
25|$|<b>Estrogens</b> {{have been}} used in the {{treatment}} of prostate cancer. The <b>estrogens</b> that {{have been used}} include diethylstilbestrol, fosfestrol (diethylstilbestrol diphosphate), ethinylestradiol, ethinylestradiol sulfonate, polyestradiol phosphate, and estradiol undecylate, as well as the combined estrogenic and nitrogen mustard alkylating antineoplastic agent estramustine phosphate. Newer <b>estrogens</b> with improved tolerability and safety like GTx-758 have also been studied. <b>Estrogens</b> are effective in the treatment of prostate cancer because they are functional antiandrogens. They both suppress testosterone concentrations to castrate levels via their antigonadotropic activity and they reduce the percentage of free and bioavailable testosterone by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin production and levels. <b>Estrogens</b> {{have been found to be}} equivalent in effectiveness to androgen deprivation therapy with castration and nonsteroidal antiandrogens. However, they significantly increase cardiovascular mortality, and for this reason, are now little used in prostate cancer. Although the most commonly employed <b>estrogens</b> like diethylstilbestrol and ethinylestradiol are associated with increased cardiovascular mortality, it is notable that certain <b>estrogens,</b> namely polyestradiol phosphate, have been found not to do so; this is attributed to different degrees of effect of the various <b>estrogens</b> on hepatic protein synthesis.|$|R
40|$|The HPLC {{qualitative}} analysis of conjugated <b>estrogens</b> {{is accomplished by}} a two-step procedure involving {{the formation of the}} corresponding dansyl derivatives. The first step involves the acid hydrolysis of the conjugated <b>estrogens,</b> followed by dansyl derivatization and HPLC separation of these derivatives on a LIChrosorb SI- 60 column with 50 % (v/v) chloroform-n-heptane as the mobile phase. All of the dansyl <b>estrogens</b> are well separated except for the 17 -keto <b>estrogens,</b> estrone, equilin, and equilenin. The second step, designed to detect the three 17 -keto <b>estrogens,</b> begins with the selective sodium borohydrlde reduction of the conju-gated 17 -keto <b>estrogens</b> to the corresponding 17 -hydroxyl compounds (the^-eplmer being formed in vast predominance over the a-eplmer), followed by acid hydrolysis, dansyl derivatization, and HPLC separation of the derivatives as in the first step. Detection of the 17 -keto <b>estrogens</b> is possible by determining differences in peak heights between the chromato-grams of the first and second analyses. The proposed method Is sensitive, the dansyl derivatives stable, and nine different <b>estrogens</b> can be readily identified...|$|R
5|$|In {{cases where}} infections {{are related to}} intercourse, taking {{antibiotics}} afterwards may be useful. In post-menopausal women, topical vaginal <b>estrogen</b> {{has been found to}} reduce recurrence. As opposed to topical creams, the use of vaginal <b>estrogen</b> from pessaries has not been as useful as low dose antibiotics. Antibiotics following short term urinary catheterization decreases the subsequent risk of a bladder infection. A number of vaccines are in development as of 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect on}} sexual desire is varied, with {{increase}} or decrease in some but with no effect in most. Combined oral contraceptives {{reduce the risk of}} ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer and do not change the risk of breast cancer. They often reduce menstrual bleeding and painful menstruation cramps. The lower doses of <b>estrogen</b> released from the vaginal ring may reduce the risk of breast tenderness, nausea, and headache associated with higher dose <b>estrogen</b> products.|$|E
5|$|The female hormone <b>estrogen,</b> {{when used}} in the {{combined}} oral contraceptive pill and in perimenopausal hormone replacement therapy, {{has been associated with}} a two- to sixfold increased risk of venous thrombosis. The risk depends on the type of hormones used, the dose of <b>estrogen,</b> and the presence of other thrombophilic risk factors. Various mechanisms, such as deficiency of protein S and tissue factor pathway inhibitor, are said to be responsible.|$|E
25|$|<b>Estrogens</b> are {{responsible}} for maturation and maintenance of the vagina and uterus, and are also involved in ovarian function, such as maturation of ovarian follicles.

50|$|Both Emmenin and Progynon {{contained}} {{a mixture of}} water-soluble conjugated <b>estrogens,</b> later determined to be mostly estriol glucuronide. Conjugates of estriol like estriol glucuronide and estriol sulfate constitute more than 90% of the <b>estrogens</b> in the urine of pregnant women. Of these conjugates, 35 to 46% are estriol glucuronide and 15 to 22% are estriol sulfate in late pregnancy; the double conjugate estriol sulfate glucuronide also occurs. Unlike unconjugated <b>estrogens</b> like estradiol and estrone, these <b>estrogens</b> were orally active.|$|R
40|$|For many years, <b>estrogens</b> {{have been}} {{considered}} typically female sex hormones. It is now certain that they are also very important in the regulation of male reproduction, whether their effect is positive or negative. Endogenous <b>estrogens</b> in mammalian males {{are an important part}} of the endocrine system. <b>Estrogens</b> play an important role in the growth and maintenance of bone mass, as well as in the development of germ cells and in the marches of spermatogenesis. Healthy sperm are essential for successful reproduction. Effect of endogenous <b>estrogens</b> is partly involved in the regulation of proper development of sperm. Besides the positive effect of endogenous <b>estrogens,</b> there is also a negative effect of <b>estrogens</b> from the external environment, so-called environmental <b>estrogens.</b> Between environmental <b>estrogens</b> are man-made chemicals, xenoestrogens, which increasingly contaminate the environment. Hazards of these estrogenic substances in nature is hidden in their ability to act as endocrine disruptors, which cause defects in many aspects of mammalian reproduction.

5|$|Hormonal {{therapy is}} only {{beneficial}} in {{certain types of}} endometrial cancer. It was {{once thought to be}} beneficial in most cases. If a tumor is well-differentiated and known to have progesterone and <b>estrogen</b> receptors, progestins may be used in treatment. About 25% of metastatic endometrioid cancers show a response to progestins. Also, endometrial stromal sarcomas can be treated with hormonal agents, including tamoxifen, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, letrozole, megestrol acetate, and medroxyprogesterone. This treatment is effective in endometrial stromal sarcomas because they typically have <b>estrogen</b> and/or progestin receptors. Progestin receptors function as tumor suppressors in endometrial cancer cells. Preliminary research and clinical trials have shown these treatments to have a high rate of response even in metastatic disease.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the risk}} factors for endometrial cancer involve high levels of estrogens. An {{estimated}} 40% of cases {{are thought to be}} related to obesity. In obesity, the excess of adipose tissue increases conversion of androstenedione into estrone, an <b>estrogen.</b> Higher levels of estrone in the blood causes less or no ovulation and exposes the endometrium to continuously high levels of estrogens. Obesity also causes less <b>estrogen</b> to be removed from the blood. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which also causes irregular or no ovulation, is associated with higher rates of endometrial cancer for the same reasons as obesity. Specifically, obesity, typeII diabetes, and insulin resistance are risk factors for TypeI endometrial cancer. Obesity increases the risk for endometrial cancer by 300–400%.|$|E
5|$|While the {{mutagenic}} and genotoxic {{effects of}} TCDD are sometimes disputed and sometimes confirmed it does foster {{the development of}} cancer. Its main action in causing cancer is cancer promotion; it promotes the carcinogenicity initiated by other compounds. Very high doses may, in addition, cause cancer indirectly; one of the proposed mechanisms is oxidative stress and the subsequent oxygen damage to DNA. There are other explanations such as endocrine disruption or altered signal transduction. The endocrine disrupting activities seem {{to be dependent on}} life stage, being anti-estrogenic when <b>estrogen</b> is present (or in high concentration) in the body, and estrogenic in the absence of <b>estrogen.</b>|$|E
40|$|Objective—Cholesterol and {{lipoprotein}} metabolism display pronounced gender differences. Premenopausal {{women have}} lower LDL and higher HDL cholesterol, whereas men display higher synthetic rates of bile acids and cholesterol. The {{effects of the}} administration of exogenous hormones to humans and animals indicate that these gender differences can often be explained by <b>estrogens.</b> We evaluated how increased levels of endogenous <b>estrogens</b> modulate cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism in women. Methods and Results—We studied healthy women during initiation of in vitro fertilization using blood samples obtained when endogenous <b>estrogens</b> were low and high. Cholesterol in VLDL and LDL, but not in HDL, was reduced 20 % when <b>estrogens</b> were high. Apolipoprotein B levels decreased 13 %. Apolipoprotein A-I and triglyceride levels increased 8 % and 37 %, respectively, whereas lipoprotein(a) levels were unchanged. Circulating PCSK 9, a suppressor of LDL receptors, was reduced 14 % when <b>estrogens</b> were high. Serum markers of bile acid and cholesterol synthesis were unaltered. Growth hormone levels increased 3 -fold when <b>estrogens</b> were high, whereas insulin-like growth factor- 1 and fibroblast growth factor- 21 concentrations were unaltered. Conclusion—In women, Apolipoprotein B-containing particles and circulating PCSK 9 are reduced when endogenous <b>estrogens</b> are high, indicating that endogenous <b>estrogens</b> induce hepatic LDL receptors partly through a posttranscrip-tional mechanism. However, <b>estrogens</b> do not stimulate bile acid or cholesterol synthesis. (Arterioscler Thromb Vas...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} <b>estrogens</b> are pleiotropic, {{affecting}} multiple bodily systems. Changes from the body’s natural fluctuating levels of <b>estrogens,</b> through surgical {{removal of the}} ovaries, natural menopause, or the administration of exogenous <b>estrogens</b> to menopausal women have been independently linked to an altered immune profile, and changes to cognitive processes. Here, we propose that inflammation may mediate the relationship between low levels of <b>estrogens</b> and cognitive decline. In order {{to determine what is}} known about this connection, we review the literature on the cognitive effects of decreased <b>estrogens</b> due to oophorectomy or natural menopause, decreased estrogens’ role on inflammation – both peripherally and in the brain – and the relationship between inflammation and cognition. While this review demonstrates that much is unknown about the intersection between <b>estrogens,</b> cognition, inflammation, we propose that there is an important interaction between these literatures...|$|R

5|$|By 1975, {{peregrine}} falcons {{had been}} reduced to 324 pairs in North America, primarily as a result of DDT, a widely used pesticide. DDT lowered <b>estrogen</b> levels in female peregrines and inhibited the production of calcium, causing eggs to thin and break during incubation. Recovery efforts for the peregrine falcon have been remarkably successful: agricultural DDT was banned by the U.S. in 1972 and efforts to breed and train peregrine falcons in captivity to later release to the wild were effective. In 1999, the peregrine falcon was removed from the U.S. Endangered Species list.|$|E

5|$|In early pregnancy, {{levels of}} <b>estrogen,</b> progesterone, {{estradiol}} increase, leading to breast growth {{in preparation for}} lactation. It has been hypothesized that if this process is interrupted by an abortionbefore full maturity (differentiation) in the third trimesterthen more immature cells could be left than there were prior to the pregnancy. These immature cells could then be exposed to carcinogens and hormones over time, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer. This mechanism was first proposed and explored in rat studies conducted in the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|Ovulation is {{the second}} phase of the ovarian cycle in which a mature egg is {{released}} from the ovarian follicles into the oviduct. During the follicular phase, estradiol suppresses release of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary gland. When the egg has nearly matured, levels of estradiol reach a threshold above which this effect is reversed and <b>estrogen</b> stimulates the production of a large amount of LH. This process, known as the LH surge, starts around day12 of the average cycle and may last 48 hours.|$|E

40|$|International audienceHormone therapy (HT) is {{the most}} {{effective}} treatment for correcting menopausal symptoms after menopause. HT initially consisted of <b>estrogens</b> alone and progestogens were secondly added to <b>estrogens</b> for preventing the risk of endometrial cancer associated to <b>estrogens</b> use. Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is a major harmful effect of HT. It is now well known that oral and transdermal <b>estrogens</b> are differentially associated with VTE risk but progestogens may be another important determinant of the thrombotic risk among HT users. Both randomized controlled trials and meta-analysis of observational studies suggested that the VTE risk was higher among users of <b>estrogens</b> plus progestogens than among users of <b>estrogens</b> alone. With respect to the different pharmacological classes of progestogens, there is evidence for a deleterious effect of medroxyprogesterone acetate on VTE risk. In addition, observational studies showed that norpregnane derivatives were significantly associated with an increased VTE risk whereas micronized progesterone could be safe with respect to thrombotic risk. The effect of tibolone on VTE risk remains uncertain. In conclusion, progestogens may have differential effects on VTE risk according to the molecules and therefore represent an important potential determinant of the thrombotic risk among postmenopausal women using <b>estrogens...</b>|$|R
