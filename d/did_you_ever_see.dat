Owens {{had played a}} younger version of The Smoking Man in two episodes of season four and was later cast as the {{recurring}} character of FBI special agent Jeffrey Spender.

5000|$|Shortland Street {{is often}} used by {{producers}} {{as a tool to}} tackle large issues in a method to provide drama and character development. Rachel's storyline's would often see her participate in these [...] "ethical issues". By the time Rachel was just 17 on the soap, she had already featured in some of the soap's most, [...] "challenging story lines". One of Rachel's earliest story lines in 1993, was the revelation she was suffering from bulimia, a highly topical illness at the time. Bloomfield thought it was important to correctly portray Rachel's diagnosis of both bulimia and anorexia, [...] "It's very rare for people to have bulimia and then anorexia. So I wanted people to understand that there are different symptoms for each. Even now there are scenes with Rachel McKenna that revolve around food that are really funny. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> her eating? No. ... We just had to spell it out because so many young kids just see her and think, 'Oh look, she's not hungry {{at this time of the}} morning and she's not eating, so why should I?" [...] Another high-profile storyline saw Rachel discover she had chlamydia and a storyline where hairdressers found nit's in her hair. Bloomfield did not wish for Rachel to be seen as a role model, citing her anger, [...] "she resorts to some really bad excuses for getting angry." [...] Storylines surrounding Rachel's reluctance to accept her maternal nature were often dealt with, Bloomfield explained, [...] "I know she likes children, but ... she'll disguise it with a sarcastic remark. You would only see it when she's alone with the child." [...] In 2009 Rachel returned with what Bloomfield described as an [...] "anti-children" [...] sentiment but following her relationship with Chris, accepted his sons into her life. By 2014, Rachel was referred to as effectively being Harry Warner's (Reid Walker) mother.|$|R
2500|$|Roman {{writing as}} a whole {{demonstrates}} a deep ambivalence towards the gladiatoria munera. Even the most complex and sophisticated munera of the Imperial era evoked the ancient, ancestral dii manes of the underworld and were framed by the protective, lawful rites of sacrificium. Their popularity made their co-option by the state inevitable; Cicero acknowledged their sponsorship as a political imperative. Despite the popular adulation of gladiators, they were set apart, despised; and despite Cicero's contempt for the mob, he shared their admiration: [...] "Even when [...] have been felled, let alone when they are standing and fighting, they never disgrace themselves. And suppose a gladiator has {{been brought to the}} ground, when <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> one twist his neck away after he has been ordered to extend it for the death blow?" [...] His own death would later emulate this example. Yet, Cicero could also refer to his popularist opponent Clodius, publicly and scathingly, as a bustuarius– literally, a [...] "funeral-man", implying that Clodius has shown the moral temperament of the lowest sort of gladiator. Such finer distinctions aside, [...] "gladiator" [...] could be (and was) used as an insult throughout the Roman period, and [...] "Samnite" [...] doubled the insult, despite the popularity of the Samnite type. Silius Italicus wrote, as the games approached their peak, that the degenerate Campanians had devised the very worst of precedents, which now threatened the moral fabric of Rome: [...] "It was their custom to enliven their banquets with bloodshed and to combine with their feasting the horrid sight of armed men [...] fighting; often the combatants fell dead above the very cups of the revelers, and the tables were stained with streams of blood. Thus demoralised was Capua." [...] Death could be rightly meted out as punishment, or met with equanimity in peace or war, as a gift of fate; but when inflicted as entertainment, with no underlying moral or religious purpose, it could only pollute and demean those who witnessed it.|$|R

As we passed by some of the small towns, many of the civilian population was [sic] on their [sic] way to church, etc. The little kids were dressed so neat and tidy. Despite the fact that the country was occupied by the Nazis, these people have not let down on the standards of cleanliness. Some of the little baby girls are so cute with curls, etc. As you pass by they call to you, “Hello Baby. ” It’s some of the words they know in English. Naturally, their motive is to extract chocolate, sweets 2 ̆ 6 chewing gum from the children-loving GIs. We saw one dressed in a little white fur coat, fur hat, and muff. I like the little ones but the older ones don’t interest me. They show too many of the ravages of having lived in an occupied country for a long time. I checked on that bond and allotment deduction. You should receive 25 more for October and a 50. 00 bond. Our office here is running it down and will write to the office of dependent benefits if necessary. Last night we got beat in the Casino game. It was our first loss in 3 consecutive nights. I think both Doc and I were a bit off form. By the way, sweets, I discovered last night that Doc 2 ̆ 6 “Winkie” celebrate their anniversary one (1) day before ours. They were married on 13 June 1942, whereas we tied the “famous knot” one day later. Isn’t it a coincidence? Last night I got into a writing mood and wrote letters to the Melnikoffs, Kitty Speert, Ukie, Speerts, and I dropped a letter to Lil Goldberg. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> her? There’s a good kid that’s “going to pot” unless she gets “the hell away” from her folks, don’t you think? Sweetheart, I wish I could tell you I love you in a more satisfactory manner than writing about it, but I guess it will have to do at the present time. Forever, Vic [Translation ends...|$|R
