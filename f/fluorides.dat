40|$|Introduction: The {{major reason}} for decline in dental caries across globe is because of {{widespread}} use of <b>fluoride</b> dentifrices. For a <b>fluoride</b> dentifrice {{to be effective in}} the control of dental caries, an adequate concentration of the <b>fluoride</b> must be soluble. Objective: To assess soluble <b>fluoride</b> and total <b>fluoride</b> content in selected commercial dentifrices in Davangere. Materials and Methods: The soluble <b>fluoride</b> and total <b>fluoride</b> content in six selected commercial dentifrices in Davangere were assessed and expressed as ppm of <b>fluoride</b> (F) (mgF/g). Total <b>fluoride</b> and soluble <b>fluoride</b> was determined using an ion-specific electrode. Descriptive statistics applied to assess the mean total <b>fluoride</b> and soluble <b>fluoride.</b> Results: The total <b>fluoride</b> and soluble <b>fluoride</b> concentrations were approximately near to 1, 000 ppm. Among the six dentifrices evaluated, four contained sodium <b>fluoride</b> (NaF) and two contained sodium monofluorophosphate (Na MFP) as <b>fluoride</b> compound. Conclusions: All the fluoridated dentifrices evaluated in this study contain adequate amount of soluble and total <b>fluoride...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—All {{currently}} used topical <b>fluoride</b> agents deposit soluble <b>fluoride</b> as calcium <b>fluoride</b> on enamel or in lesions. Calcium <b>fluoride</b> {{serves as a}} source of <b>fluoride</b> for the formation of fluorapatite. The latter phase is formed when pH drops in plaque, not during topical application. The potential for calcium <b>fluoride</b> formation should probably be increased in topical <b>fluoride</b> agents. In countries with low caries prevalence, the clinical recommendations for topical <b>fluoride</b> need to be reconsidered. Toothpaste is the basic <b>fluoride</b> regimen recommended for everybody. The need for additional <b>fluoride</b> supplementation depends on caries activity. There is no distinct difference in the caries-preventive effects of concentrated <b>fluoride</b> solutions, gels, or varnishes. Thus, the choice of method depends on costs, convenience, patient acceptance, and safety. The use of <b>fluoride</b> varnishes {{has proven to be a}} feasible and safe method of <b>fluoride</b> application. With <b>fluoride</b> varnishes, the amounts of <b>fluoride</b> exposure can be better controlled, and less chair-time is required compared with conventional solutions and gels. No dose-response effect to concentrated <b>fluoride</b> agents is apparent, and the benefit of frequent application is not clearly established. In individuals with the most severe cariogenic challenge, combinations of <b>fluoride</b> and antimicrobials may give better clinical effects than <b>fluoride</b> alone.

The <b>fluoride</b> {{concentration in the}} oral fluids after tooth brushing with <b>fluoride</b> dentifrices may have an important relationship to the caries reducing capacity. The present study was aimed to clinically evaluate the salivary <b>fluoride</b> retention of dentifrices containing low <b>fluoride</b> concentration in 50 children, aged 7 - 9 years before, {{during and after the}} use of <b>fluoride</b> toothpaste. Estimation of <b>fluoride</b> in saliva was done using a Orion microprocessor ion analyser with a <b>fluoride</b> specific ion electrode.

The retention of <b>fluoride</b> in the saliva at a higher level even with the low <b>fluoride</b> concentration, proves the similar cariostatic effect as of higher concentration...|$|R
25|$|<b>Fluoride</b> {{in various}} forms {{is the most popular}} active {{ingredient}} in toothpaste to prevent cavities. <b>Fluoride</b> occurs in small amounts in plants, animals, and some natural water sources. The additional <b>fluoride</b> in toothpaste has beneficial effects on the formation of dental enamel and bones. Sodium <b>fluoride</b> (NaF) is the most common source of <b>fluoride,</b> but stannous <b>fluoride</b> (SnF2), olaflur (an organic salt of <b>fluoride),</b> and sodium monofluorophosphate (Na2PO3F) are also used.

50|$|<b>Fluoride</b> varnish is {{composed}} of {{a high concentration of}} <b>fluoride</b> as a salt or silane preparation in a fast drying, alcohol and resin based solution. The concentration, form of <b>fluoride,</b> and dispensing method may vary depending on the manufacturer. While most <b>fluoride</b> varnishes contain 5% sodium <b>fluoride</b> at least one brand of <b>fluoride</b> varnish contains 1% difluorsilane in a polyurethane base and one brand contains 2.5% sodium <b>fluoride</b> that has been milled to perform similar to 5% sodium <b>fluoride</b> products in a shellac base.|$|R
5|$|Owing to {{the expense}} of {{refining}} pure fluorine, most commercial applications use fluorine compounds, with about half of mined fluorite used in steelmaking. The rest of the fluorite is converted into corrosive hydrogen fluoride en route to various organic <b>fluorides,</b> or into cryolite which {{plays a key role}} in aluminium refining. Organic <b>fluorides</b> have very high chemical and thermal stability; their major uses are as refrigerants, electrical insulation and cookware, the last as PTFE (Teflon). Pharmaceuticals such as atorvastatin and fluoxetine also contain fluorine, and the fluoride ion inhibits dental cavities, and so finds use in toothpaste and water fluoridation. Global fluorochemical sales amount to more than US$15 billion a year.|$|E
5|$|The highest known {{ruthenium}} halide is the hexafluoride, a {{dark brown}} solid that melts at 54°C.

Ruthenium pentafluoride is a tetrameric dark green solid that is also readily hydrolyzed, melting at 86.5°C. The yellow ruthenium tetrafluoride is probably also polymeric and can be formed by reducing the pentafluoride with iodine. Among the binary compounds of ruthenium, these high oxidation states are known only in the oxides and <b>fluorides.</b>|$|E

A control population was included (no systemic <b>fluoride,</b> n = 24). <b>Fluoride</b> intake from diet and dentifrice, urinary <b>fluoride</b> excretion, and <b>fluoride</b> concentrations in fingernails/toenails were evaluated. <b>Fluoride</b> was analyzed with an ion-selective electrode.

5|$|Actinide salts {{can also}} be {{obtained}} by dissolving the corresponding hydroxides in acids. Nitrates, chlorides, sulfates and perchlorates of actinides are water-soluble. When crystallizing from aqueous solutions, these salts forming a hydrates, such as Th(NO3)4·6H2O, Th(SO4)2·9H2O and Pu2(SO4)3·7H2O. Salts of high-valence actinides easily hydrolyze. So, colorless sulfate, chloride, perchlorate and nitrate of thorium transform into basic salts with formulas Th(OH)2SO4 and Th(OH)3NO3. The solubility and insolubility of trivalent and tetravalent actinides is like that of lanthanide salts. So phosphates, <b>fluorides,</b> oxalates, iodates and carbonates of actinides are weakly soluble in water; they precipitate as hydrates, such as ThF4·3H2O and Th(CrO4)2·3H2O.|$|E

Uranium easily yields a colorless hexafluoride, which sublimates at a temperature of 56.5°C; because of its volatility, it {{is used in the}} separation of uranium isotopes with gas centrifuge or gaseous diffusion.

5|$|Before mendelevium's discovery, Seaborg and Katz {{predicted}} {{that it should}} be predominantly trivalent in aqueous solution and hence should behave similarly to other tripositive lanthanides and actinides. After the synthesis of mendelevium in 1955, these predictions were confirmed, first in the observation at its discovery that it eluted just after fermium in the trivalent actinide elution sequence from a cation-exchange column of resin, and later the 1967 observation that mendelevium could form insoluble hydroxides and <b>fluorides</b> that coprecipitated with trivalent lanthanide salts. Cation-exchange and solvent extraction studies led to the conclusion that mendelevium was a trivalent actinide with an ionic radius somewhat smaller than that of the previous actinide, fermium.
