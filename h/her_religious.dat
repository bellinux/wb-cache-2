The controversy involved her belief that abortion was tragic but should be legal, despite her vows as a religious and the teachings of the Catholic Church.|$|E

5|$|Dot {{has been}} {{generally}} well received by critics; {{she has been}} referred to as a cultural archetype and Brown has won multiple awards for her portrayal. However, aspects of the character such as her smoking and <b>her</b> <b>religious</b> beliefs have been criticised, with religious groups suggesting Dot's faith is used in a pejorative manner. The character has also made an impact on popular culture; she has been spoofed, most notably by Alistair McGowan, and has been credited as inspiration for catwalk collections.|$|E
5|$|Americans' mistrust and {{dislike of}} lawyers was a {{frequent}} topic of dissection in social problem films such Lawyer Man (1933), State's Attorney, and The Mouthpiece (1932). In films such as Paid (1930), the legal system turns innocent characters into criminals. The life of Joan Crawford's character is ruined and her romantic interest is executed so that she may live free, although she is innocent of the crime for which the district attorney wants to convict <b>her.</b> <b>Religious</b> hypocrisy was addressed in such films as The Miracle Woman (1931), starring Barbara Stanwyck and directed by Frank Capra. Stanwyck also portrayed a nurse and initially reluctant heroine who manages to save, via unorthodox means, two young children in danger from nefarious characters (including Clark Gable as a malevolent chauffeur) in Night Nurse (1931).|$|E
5|$|By 1858, Malo-Galipeau {{had become}} widely {{recognised}} as foundress of the Misericordia Sisters, {{partly due to}} her role as Mother Superior and {{partly due to the}} endowment she had brought to the community upon her arrival. This understanding was reflected in published works of the time, including a souvenir album prepared by the City of Montreal in 1853. However, during Bourget's visit to the Institute in late 1858, he made a speech to the assembled community confirming that in the eyes of himself and of the Church, Cadron-Jetté should receive credit as the foundress of the congregation. He also bestowed upon Cadron-Jetté the title of Mother (such that <b>her</b> <b>religious</b> name became Mother Mary of the Nativity, or Mère de la Nativité) and confirmed that she was second in authority only to the current Mother Superior of the community.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the years}} {{scholars}} have postulated {{a number of}} theories about what Stowe {{was trying to say}} with the novel (aside from the obvious themes, such as condemning slavery). For example, as an ardent Christian and active abolitionist, Stowe placed many of <b>her</b> <b>religious</b> beliefs into the novel. Some scholars have stated that Stowe saw her novel as offering a solution to the moral and political dilemma that troubled many slavery opponents: whether engaging in prohibited behavior was justified in opposing evil. Was the use of violence to oppose the violence of slavery and the breaking of proslavery laws morally defensible? Which of Stowe's characters should be emulated, the passive Uncle Tom or the defiant George Harris? Stowe's solution was similar to Ralph Waldo Emerson's: God's will would be followed if each person sincerely examined his principles and acted on them.|$|E
5|$|Shaw is {{the only}} {{religious}} believer in the crew and openly displays <b>her</b> <b>religious</b> belief with a necklace of a Christian cross. Lindelof said that with her scientific knowledge, her beliefs felt outdated in 2093. Shaw is excited when she learns that she {{was created by the}} Engineers and not a supernatural deity, but rather than cause her to lose her faith, it reinforces it. Lindelof said that asking questions and searching for meaning is the point of being alive, and so the audience is left to question whether Shaw was protected by God because of her faith. Scott wanted the film to end with Shaw's declaration that she is still searching for definitive answers. In addition to the religious themes, Lindelof said that Prometheus is pro-science and explores whether scientific knowledge and faith in God can co-exist.|$|E
5|$|The {{courts in}} Malaysia {{have taken a}} similar {{approach}} in defining the meaning of religious practice under Article 11 of the Malaysian Constitution. Furthermore, they have also consulted religious texts to determine what type of acts might constitute religious practices. In Halimatussaadiah v. Public Service Commission, Malaysia (1992), the appellant claimed she had been wrongfully dismissed from her employment due to her refusal to comply with employment conditions that prohibited any attire that covered a female public servant's face while on duty. According to the appellant, this contravened her right to religious practice on grounds that the wearing of the purdah was part of <b>her</b> <b>religious</b> practice as a Muslim. However, the court disagreed and held that the purdah was not considered a religious practice as {{it was not a}} requirement under Islam since there was no express mention of such a requirement in the Quran.|$|E
