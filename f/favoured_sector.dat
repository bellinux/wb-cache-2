40|$|Abstract: The paper {{considers}} the irreversible investment response to trade liberalisation when agents perceive {{there to be}} a positive probability that the liberalisation may be reversed. It is shown that even with full credibility the aggregate investment response may be weak since investment will collapse in the unfavoured sector {{as a result of the}} change in domestic relative prices. Limited credibility reduces the investment response in the <b>favoured</b> <b>sector</b> and hence reduces aggregate investment. The effect is particularly strong if investment involves delivery lags before new capital becomes productive.

40|$|Many trade liberalisations {{and other}} {{economic}} reforms in developing countries, particularly in Africa, have been reversed. In addition {{to the loss of}} benefits from reform as such this tendency has led to concern that the response to reform, particularly from investment, may be weakened by the perception that it may be reversed and in turn that weak investment may itself lessen the chances of successful reform. These themes have been discussed extensively in the literature, the current paper's contribution being to develop a much more complete model of the investment response than previously available and to use it to partially endogenise the probability of reform reversal so the two are simultaneously determined. With respect to the reversal probability the argument presented is that a strong investment response in the <b>favoured</b> <b>sector</b> will of itself tend to discourage reversal of the reform (through a lobbying mechanism or simply by the existence of a larger constituency opposed to reversal) while the gradual depreciation of capital in the nonfavoured sector will weaken opposition to reform continuation.

40|$|Current {{explanations}} for private consumption’s diminished role in China {{focus on the}} expansion of exports and investments. Using structural path analysis, we find additional contributing factors. First, growth patterns during 1997 - 2007 <b>favoured</b> <b>sectors</b> with low production multipliers. Secondly, income multipliers fell in most sectors, especially in fast growing sectors and partly due to urbanization. This means less trickledown from growth to household incomes. Thirdly, households became less important in sustaining domestic production processes. Together, these deep structural changes suggest that enhancing private consumption’s role in China will require new (services-oriented) growth patterns and a significant realignment of industry-household linkages...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} closed access. The Statistical DownScaling Model (SDSM) is a freely {{available}} tool that produces high resolution climate change scenarios. The first public {{version of the}} software was released in 2001 and since then there have been over 170 documented studies worldwide. This article recounts the underlining conceptual and technical evolution of SDSM, drawing upon independent assessments of model capabilities. These studies show that SDSM yields reliable estimates of extreme temperatures, seasonal precipitation totals, areal and inter-site precipitation behaviour. Frequency estimation of extreme precipitation amounts in dry seasons is less reliable. A meta-analysis of SDSM outputs shows a preponderance of research in Canada, China and the UK, whereas the United States and Australasia are under-represented. In line with the wider downscaling community, the most <b>favoured</b> <b>sector</b> of analysis is water and flood risk management which accounts for {{nearly half of all}} output; research in other sectors such as agriculture, built environment and human health is less prominent but growing. Over 50 % of the studies are concerned with production of climate scenarios, comparison or technical refinement of downscaling methodologies. In contrast, there is relatively little evidence of application to adaptation planning and climate risk management. We assert that further attention to physically meaningful quantities such as wind speeds, wave heights, phenological and hazard metrics could improve uptake of downscaled products. Chronic uncertainty in boundary forcing continues to undermine confidence in downscaled scenarios so these tools are best used for sensitivity testing and adaptation options appraisal...|$|E
40|$|Research {{shows that}} a lower {{proportion}} of women than men are in graduate level jobs, six months after leaving seven top UK universities. This paper presents new empirical evidence from a unique dataset on the significantly different attitudes and behaviours between Oxford men and women undergraduates that might explain why women {{are less likely to}} have secured a graduate level job than men. Lower self-assurance, firmer beliefs in gender stereotypes, strong prestige and gender-characterisation of occupations, and <b>favouring</b> <b>sectors</b> with informal and low-status entry, all contribute to a lower proportion of women securing graduate level jobs. Despite many advances in recent years narrowing the gap between men and women, there remain policy implications for curriculum delivery and co-curricular courses to increase women’s self-assurance and assertiveness, and thereby enable them to aspire to and then secure a wider range of higher prestige occupations...|$|R
40|$|China {{committed}} {{itself to}} reduce the carbon intensity of its economy (the amount of CO 2 emitted per unit of GDP) by 40 - 45 % during 2005 - 2020. Yet, between 2002 and 2009, China experienced a 3 % increase in carbon intensity, though trends differed greatly among its 30 provinces. Decomposition analysis shows that sectoral efficiency gains in nearly all provinces were offset by movement towards a more carbon-intensive economic structure. Such a sectoral shift seemed to be heavily affected by the growing role of investments and capital accumulation in China's growth process which has <b>favoured</b> <b>sectors</b> with high carbon intensity. Panel data regressions show that changes in carbon intensity were smallest in sectors dominating the regional economy (so as not to endanger these large sectors, which are the mainstay of the provincial economy), whereas scale and convergence effects played a much smaller role...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAllocating {{water to}} {{different}} uses implies trading off the benefits perceived by different sectors. This paper demonstrates how visualising the trade-offs {{implied by the}} best performing water management options helps balance water use benefits and find sustainable solutions. The approach consists of linking a water resources model that can simulate many management policies and track diverse measures of system performance, to a many-objective evolutionary optimisation algorithm. This generates the set of Pareto-optimal management alternatives for several simultaneous objectives. The relative performance of these efficient management alternatives is then visualised as trade-off curves or surfaces using visual analytic plots. Visually assessing trade-offs between benefits helps select policies that achieve a decision-maker-selected balance between different metrics of system performance. We apply this approach to a multi-reservoir water resource system in Brazil's semi-arid Jaguaribe basin where current water allocation procedures <b>favour</b> <b>sectors</b> with greater political power and technical knowledge. The case study identifies promising reservoir operating policies by exploring trade-offs between economic, ecological and livelihood benefits as well as traditional hydropower generation, irrigation and water supply.

The existing policy of VRA's on steel is estimated to have a welfare cost of equal to 6. 5 percent of the present value of base consumption. Furthermore, it is shown that the joint presence of imperfect competition and rent-shifting VRA's implies that a partial tightening of the steel quotas would lead of an improvement in national welfare which is quantitatively significant, even though free trade in steel is the globally optimal policy. ...|$|R

40|$|China's tariff {{structure}} <b>favours</b> labour-intensive <b>sectors,</b> {{and this is}} at odds with traditional theory of comparative advantage. The paper argues that tariffs in China are a mechanism for protecting technology-backward domestic - especially state-owned enterprises (SOEs) from competition technology-advanced foreign enterprises producing in China. With relatively integrated labour markets and cross-firm technology differences, SOEs' subsistence is supported by subsidized credit and limited access of foreign firms' local production to tariff-protected domestic markets. Labour market integration and capital subsidies increase the relative cost of labour in SOEs compared to their foreign competitors, hurting more domestic firms in industries that use labour more intensively. Restrictions to FIEs' (foreign-invested enterprises) access to tariff-protected product markets, which protect more labour-intensive industries, compensate for the greater cost disadvantage of SOEs in labour-intensive sectors.

40|$|Examining the {{problems}} for post-communist {{countries in the}} context of the European Union. This paper focuses on China and the role of rural-urban migration in economic development under capitalism. The economic relationships between the urban and rural areas of a less developed economy encompass the terms of trade between rural and urban products, the intersectoral transfer of labour, the relative wages of labour in the two sectors, the intersectoral transfer of saving, the relative sectoral returns to investment, the relative sectoral contributions to tax revenue and benefits from public expenditure, and the extent to which government policies <b>favour</b> one <b>sector</b> over the other. There are at least three theoretical frameworks for the analysis of these relationships: the Lewis model of eco­nomic growth with surplus rural labour, the 'coercive', or 'price-scissors', model of economic growth financed by extracting a rural surplus, and the notion that economic policy is subject to 'urban bias'...|$|R
40|$|Throughout {{the second}} half of the 20 th century, Indonesia's trade {{policies}} favoured the modern manufacturing sector relative to agriculture. Within agriculture, they <b>favoured</b> import-competing <b>sectors</b> at the expense of export-competing sectors. Rice is the most important import-competing agricultural sector and, until 2000, assistance to rice growers came mainly from input subsidies. The extent of subsidies to rice and other import-competing agriculture varied with foreign exchange availability and the government's budgetary circumstances: 'good' times produced more interventionist policies and 'bad' times produced less government intervention. Since the mid- 1980 s, the aggregate bias in favour of manufacturing has declined greatly and agriculture is now only lightly taxed relative to manufacturing. This change resulted from the reduction in manufacturing protection that has characterised this period and from the increased protection of rice and sugar occurring after 2000. We attempt to explain the political forces underlying these changes in trade policy. ...|$|R

40|$|Motivated by {{the recent}} global {{economic}} crisis, this paper simulated {{the impact of a}} rise in the price of imported food on agriculture and household poverty in Nigeria using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model and the Foster, Greer and Thorbecke (FGT) class of decomposable poverty measures on the 2006 social accounting matrix (SAM) of Nigeria and the updated 2004 Nigeria Living Standards Survey (NLSS) data. Results show that a rise in import price of food increased domestic output of food, but reduced the domestic supply of other agricultural commodities as well as food and other agricultural composites. Furthermore, a rise in the import price of food increased poverty nationally and among all household groups, with rural-north households being the least affected by the shock, while their rural-south counterparts were the most affected. A major policy implication drawn from this paper is that high import prices in import competing sectors like agriculture tend to <b>favour</b> the <b>sector</b> but exacerbate poverty in households. Thus, efforts geared at addressing the impact of this shock should strive to balance welfare and efficiency issues. </p...|$|R
