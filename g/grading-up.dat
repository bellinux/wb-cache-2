500|$|The breed almost {{disappeared}} {{during the}} Second World War as ponies were taken for breeding vanners (animals which pulled commercial wagons), {{for work in}} towns and cities, and {{for use by the}} British Army as pack and artillery ponies. Many ponies used by the military in Europe were left behind after the war, and in many cases they were slaughtered for food. The population declined during the war {{to such an extent that}} only four new fillies were registered in 1955. However, the post-war future of the Dales pony was preserved by a small group of breeders, who began to search for unregistered ponies of the proper type. The 1960s saw three Fell pony stallions interbred with Dale mares, to help save the breed. In 1964 the Dales Pony Society underwent reorganisation. At the same time, a [...] "Grading-Up Register" [...] was developed, with the aim of identifying and breeding ponies with characteristics of the original Dales type. The <b>grading-up</b> program was successful, and by 1971, populations had been rebuilt to the point that the program was discontinued. By the 1990s, the population had grown enough to allow some ponies to be exported – twelve to Canada in 1991 and four to the US in 1994. By 1999, there were 60 registered ponies in North America, and an estimated 800 worldwide. In the same year, the Dales Pony Society of America was formed as the official US sub-registry of the UK breed registry.|$|E
5000|$|The Fell Pony Committee {{resolved}} {{to become a}} Society in 1916, [...] "to keep pure the old breed of pony that has roamed the northern hills for years". However, {{it was not until}} 1918, with the end of World War I, that the resolution became reality. In 1922 the Society restructured itself on [...] "more liberal lines" [...] in order to attract more members to the support of the Fell pony. Nonetheless, the breed's numbers decreased considerably, until 1945, when a breeding [...] "stallion enclosure" [...] program and a <b>grading-up</b> system were started. The program was discontinued in 1970. In the affluent 1950s, riding for pleasure began to gain popularity, securing the future of many British native breeds. The number of ponies being registered with the Fell Pony Society has risen gradually ever since.|$|E

40|$|A genetic {{study of}} the <b>grading-up</b> of the East African zebu to the Indian Sahiwal has been {{undertaken}} on records, covering about 25 years, from three livestock Improvement Centres in Kenya. It appears from this study that the indigenous East African zebu cow has {{only about half the}} genetic potential of the Indian Sahiwal for milk production, and the scheme of <b>grading-up</b> has resulted in substantial and worthwhile increases in milk production...|$|E

40|$|Genetic {{characterization}} {{helps to}} assure breed integrity and to assign individuals to defined populations. The {{objective of this}} study was to characterize genetic diversity in six horse breeds and to analyse the population structure of the Franches-Montagnes breed, especially with regard to the degree of introgression with Warmblood. A total of 402 alleles from 50 microsatellite loci were used. The average number of alleles per locus was significantly lower in Thoroughbreds and Arabians. Average heterozygosities between breeds ranged from 0. 61 to 0. 72. The overall average of the coefficient of gene differentiation because of breed differences was 0. 100, with a range of 0. 036 - 0. 263. No significant correlation was found between this parameter and the number of alleles per locus. An increase in the number of homozygous loci with increasing inbreeding could not be shown for the Franches-Montagnes horses. The proportion of shared alleles, combined with the neighbour-joining method, defined clusters for Icelandic Horse, Comtois, Arabians and Franches-Montagnes. A more disparate clustering could be seen for European Warmbloods and Thoroughbreds, presumably from frequent <b>grading-up</b> of Warmbloods with Thoroughbreds. <b>Grading-up</b> effects were also observed when Bayesian and Monte Carlo resampling approaches were used for individual assignment to a given population. Individual breed assignments to defined reference populations will be very difficult when introgression has occurred. The Bayesian approach within the Franches-Montagnes breed differentiated individuals with varied proportions of Warmblood...|$|E
40|$|The {{monograph}} reports activities {{related to}} cattle improvement in the British colonial territories in Africa. It consists of four parts. Part one presents the general background to the improvement of cattle in the territories describing ecological conditions, economic and social significance of cattle, environmental and animal husbandry conditions. Part two follows with discussions on methods adopted by colonial governments {{for the improvement of}} cattle. This part outlines the objectives of cattle improvement programmes; methods of improvement involving selection of indigenous stock and introduction of exotic breeds; adaptability of the indigenous breeds to various environmental conditions and the government stock farms and improvement centres. Part three details some general principles of cattle improvement in tropical Africa focusing on <b>grading-up</b> processes and their applicability in the field. Part four presents specific problems of cattle improvement in each of the colonial territories. There are pictographic illustrations throughout the book, appendices and bibliography at the end...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the genetic diversity among Simmental Cross cattle in West Sumatra using microsatellite DNA markers. A total of 176 individual cattle blood samples was used for obtaining DNA samples. Twelve primers of microsatellite loci as recommended by FAO were used to identify the genetic diversity of the Simmental Cross cattle population. Multiplex DNA fragment analysis method was used for allele identification. All the microsatellite loci in this study were highly polymorphic and all of the identified alleles were able to classify the cattle population into several groups based on their genetic distance. The heterozygosity values of microsatellite loci in this study ranged from 0. 556 to 0. 782. The polymorphism information content (PIC) value of the 12 observed loci is high (PIC> 0. 5). The highest PIC value in the Simmental cattle population was 0. 893 (locus TGLA 53), while the lowest value was 0. 529 (locus BM 1818). Based on the genetic distance value, the subpopulation of the Simmental Cross-Agam and the Simmental Cross-Limapuluh Kota was exceptionally close to the Simmental Purebred thus indicating that a <b>grading-up</b> process has taken place with the Simmental Purebred. In view of the advantages possessed by the Simmental Cross cattle and the evaluation of the genetic diversity results, a number of subpopulations in this study can be considered as the initial (base) population for the Simmental Cross cattle breeding programs in West Sumatra, Indonesia...|$|E
40|$|Reproductive performance, mortality, growth, and culling and {{replacement}} rates based on 20000 calving records were evaluated for grade Boran beef cattle maintained with trypanosomiasis risk in Tanzania. Under ranching conditions, over a 10 -year period {{in this area}} of high Glossina moistens morsitans, G. and G. brevipalpis challenge, a calving interval of 15. 9 months, pre-weaning mortality of 8 %, annual cow mortality of 5. 8 % and 8 -month weaning weight of 133. 5 kg resulted in a herd productivity of 96 kg of weaner calf per cow per year. The proportion of heifers required as replacements (45 %) and the generation interval (6. 9 years) indicated scope for implementation of selection programmes on growth traits. The level of productivity achieved compared favourably with major data sets recently analysed from pure Boran cattle under trypanosomiasis-free ranching conditions in Kenya, and from trypanotolerant N'Dama cattle in West Africa. These results indicate the possibility of improving livestock production in tsetse-infested areas by the rational use of chemoprophylaxis {{as an integral part of}} management. Year, season, cow age, calf sex and location on ranch had significant effects on practically all the traits of calving interval, pre-weaning mortality and growth, and cow productivity. Superior performance where bush clearance and tsetse fly control had taken place suggests that economic evaluation of these interventions should be attempted. The season of calving had a major effect on productivity. Cows of 5 - 8 years of age were the most productive, as were animals producing male calves, features well recognized in beef cattle production. An average of 4. 4 treatments with Samorin, a prophylactic, and 0. 6 treatments with Berenil, a therapeutic, were required per year. The number of treatments varied from year to year and by area, being greater in the south of the ranch where the tsetse challenge was considered higher. However, the age and season of calving had little effect on the number of treatments required. Despite such extensive use of trypanocidal drugs, there was no indication that drug resistance had developed or evidence that repeated inoculation of Samorin had affected productivity. <b>Grading-up</b> of small East African Zebu cattle to Boran over an 8 -year period allowed annual comparison of birth weight, pre-weaning growth and weaning weights of two groups of calves, one having a higher level of Boran genes (varying from 12 to 60 % higher annually) than the other. Those with the higher level of Boran genes performed better by 3. 3 % for all attributes studied, but as the percentage difference in Boran genes decreased, so did this difference. In an environment improved through bush clearance and tsetse fly control, the calves with higher levels of Boran genes were superior, but this superiority was not expressed in the unimproved environment...|$|E
