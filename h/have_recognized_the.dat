5|$|Not My Life calls {{attention}} to the fact that, in the United States, the sentencing for human trafficking is less severe than for drug trafficking. The film indicates a relationship between contemporary slavery and globalization. It asserts that most human trafficking victims are children, although the filmmakers <b>have</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>the</b> fact that millions of adults are also trafficked. The film depicts human trafficking as a matter of good and evil, provides interviews with survivors of human trafficking, and presents analysis from anti-trafficking advocates. Throughout the film, Robert Bilheimer encourages viewers to personally combat human trafficking. Bilheimer was sparing in his use of statistics in the film, feeling that overloading viewers with figures might numb them to the issues.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s, {{prominent}} {{individuals and organizations}} <b>have</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>the</b> seminal importance of Engelbart's contributions. In December 1995, at the Fourth WWW Conference in Boston, {{he was the first}} recipient of what would later become the Yuri Rubinsky Memorial Award. In 1997 he was awarded the Lemelson-MIT Prize of $500,000, the world's largest single prize for invention and innovation, and the ACM Turing Award. To mark the 30th anniversary of Engelbart's 1968 demo, in 1998 the Stanford Silicon Valley Archives and the Institute for the Future hosted Engelbart's Unfinished Revolution, a symposium at Stanford University's Memorial Auditorium, to honor Engelbart and his ideas. He was inducted into National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Albany, New York, Hand majored in {{philosophy}} at Harvard College and graduated with honors from Harvard Law School. After a short career as a lawyer in Albany and New York City, he was appointed {{at the age of}} 37 as a Federal District Judge in Manhattan in 1909. The profession suited his detached and open-minded temperament, and his decisions soon won him a reputation for craftsmanship and authority. Between 1909 and 1914, under the influence of Herbert Croly's social theories, Hand supported New Nationalism. He ran unsuccessfully as the Progressive Party's candidate for Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals in 1913, but withdrew from active politics shortly afterwards. In 1924, President Calvin Coolidge promoted Hand to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which he went on to lead as the Senior Circuit Judge (later retitled Chief Judge) from 1939 until his semi-retirement in 1951. Scholars <b>have</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>the</b> Second Circuit under Hand as one of the finest appeals courts in the country's history. Friends and admirers often lobbied for Hand's promotion to the Supreme Court, but circumstances and his political past conspired against his appointment.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1018 Ivan Vladislav besieged Dyrrhachium, but in February {{he was killed}} under {{the walls of the}} city. The {{accounts}} of his death are contradictory. According to some he became victim of a plot and was killed by his servants; according to others, he perished in battle. The Bulgarian additions to the Skylitzes Chronicle are more detailed, saying that Ivan Vladislav dueled with the strategos of Dyrrhachium, the patrikios Niketas Pegonites, on horseback, and while fighting, two Byzantine infantrymen from the audience rushed to the emperor and wounded him mortally in the belly. A later Byzantine historian claimed that the duel was fair and Pegonites stabbed Ivan Vladislav in the chest with his spear, killing him instantly. The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja reports an altogether different story: while having a meal in his camp, the emperor was attacked by an unknown soldier, in whom Ivan Vladislav seemed to <b>have</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>the</b> murdered Jovan Vladimir. Terrified, he cried for help but no one rushed to his rescue and the unknown soldier mortally wounded the Bulgarian ruler.|$|E

The Hyksos rapidly withdrew to the north and Thebes regained some independence under the Seventeenth Dynasty. From then on, Hyksos relations with the south seem to have been mainly of a commercial nature, although Theban princes appear to <b>have</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>the</b> Hyksos rulers and may possibly have provided them with tribute for a period.|$|E

However, to their advantage, the Deepwater Railway charter already granted by West Virginia came to a location within a fairly short distance of the Virginia state line.|$|E
25|$|Controversy over {{significance}} testing, and {{its effects}} on publication bias in particular, has produced several results. The American Psychological Association has strengthened its statistical reporting requirements after review, medical journal publishers <b>have</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>the</b> obligation to publish some results that are not statistically significant to combat publication bias and a journal (Journal of Articles in Support of the Null Hypothesis) has been created to publish such results exclusively. Textbooks have added some cautions and increased coverage of the tools necessary to estimate the size of the sample required to produce significant results. Major organizations have not abandoned use of significance tests although some have discussed doing so.|$|E

25|$|One {{study found}} that objectively ranking MBA {{programs}} {{by a combination of}} graduates' starting salaries and average student GMAT score can reasonably duplicate the top 20 list of the national publications, and concluded that a truly objective ranking would be individualized to the needs of each prospective student. National publications <b>have</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>the</b> value of rankings against different criteria, and now offer lists ranked different ways: by salary, GMAT score of students, selectivity, and so forth. While useful, these rankings have yet to meet the critique that rankings are not tailored to individual needs, that they use an incomplete population of schools, may fail to distinguish between the different MBA program types offered by each school, or rely on subjective interviews.|$|E

Studies of genetic diversity have been performed on Coffea arabica varieties, which were found to be of low diversity but with retention of some residual heterozygosity from ancestral materials, and closely related diploid species Coffea canephora and C. liberica; however, no direct evidence has ever been found indicating where in Africa coffee grew or who among the natives might have used it as a stimulant or known about it there earlier than the seventeenth century. The original domesticated coffee plant {{is said to have been}} from Harar, and the native population is thought to be derived from Ethiopia with distinct nearby populations in Sudan and Kenya.|$|E
25|$|Three {{improvements}} to card security {{have been introduced}} to the more common credit card networks, but none has proven to help reduce credit card fraud so far. First, the cards themselves are being replaced with similar-looking tamper-resistant smart cards which are intended to make forgery more difficult. The majority of smart card (IC card) based credit cards comply with the EMV (Europay MasterCard Visa) standard. Second, an additional 3 or 4 digit card security code (CSC) is now present {{on the back of}} most cards, for use in card not present transactions. Stakeholders at all levels in electronic payment <b>have</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>the</b> need to develop consistent global standards for security that account for and integrate both current and emerging security technologies.

25|$|Laying {{the main}} stress on {{historical}} arguments, the North Korean authorities were less keen on emphasizing {{the principle of}} effective possession (a keystone of the South Korean standpoint), for this would <b>have</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>the</b> Republic of Korea as a legitimate state entity. Since both the ROK and the DPRK has been prone to consider itself as the sole legitimate government on the Korean Peninsula, the North Korean authorities, though they never consented to Japan's territorial claims, often found it inconvenient to side with Seoul against Tokyo in the dispute. In those periods when North Korea was on better terms with Japan than with the ROK (like 1955–1964, 1970–1977, and 1997–1998), North Korean propaganda essentially ignored {{the problem of the}} Liancourt Rocks. However, if Pyongyang felt threatened by Japanese-South Korean rapprochement (as it occurred in 1965–1968) or sought to cooperate with Seoul against Tokyo (as it happened in 2000–2001), the North Korean media promptly raised the issue, with the aim of causing friction in Japanese-ROK relations.|$|E
25|$|As {{the walls}} {{carrying}} these vaults were also built in concrete with occasional bond courses of brick, the whole structure was homogeneous. One {{of the important}} ingredients of the mortar was a volcanic deposit found near Rome, known as pozzolana, which, when the concrete had set, not only made the concrete as solid as the rock itself, but {{to a certain extent}} neutralized the thrust of the vaults, which formed shells equivalent to that of a metal lid; the Romans, however, do not seem to <b>have</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>the</b> value of this pozzolana mixture, for they otherwise provided amply for the counteracting of any thrust which might exist by the erection of cross walls and buttresses. In the tepidaria of the Thermae and in the basilica of Constantine, in order to bring the thrust well within the walls, the main barrel vault of the hall was brought forward on each side and rested on detached columns, which constituted the principal architectural decoration. In cases where the cross vaults intersecting were not of the same span as those of the main vault, the arches were either stilted so that their soffits might be of the same height, or they formed smaller intersections in {{the lower part of the}} vault; in both of these cases, however, the intersections or groins were twisted, for which it was very difficult to form a centering, and, moreover, they were of disagreeable effect: though every attempt was made to mask this in the decoration of the vault by panels and reliefs modelled in stucco.|$|E
