This paper examines the determinants of bank <b>interest</b> <b>margins</b> using a sample of 456 banks in 41 SSA countries. The results show that market concentration is positively associated with <b>interest</b> <b>margins,</b> but the impact depends on the level of efficiency of each bank. In particular, compared to inefficient banks, efficient ones increase their margins more in concentrated markets. This indicates that policies that promote competition and reduce market concentration would help lower <b>interest</b> <b>margins</b> in SSA. The results also show that bank-specific factors such as credit risk, liquidity risk, and bank equity are important determinants of <b>interest</b> <b>margins.</b> Finally, <b>interest</b> <b>margins</b> are sensitive to inflation, but not to economic growth or public or foreign ownership. There are regional differences within SSA regarding the level of <b>interest</b> <b>margins</b> even after controlling for other factors. JEL Classification Numbers:E 44; G 21; L 8...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes an {{alternative}} {{explanation for the}} decline in bank <b>interest</b> <b>margins</b> in many developed countries, which, in our view, better fits the empirical and narrative evidence on bank behavior {{in the run-up to}} the credit crisis. A common thread in the literature on bank <b>interest</b> <b>margins</b> is a causality that runs from competition to lower margins to new activities. The causal chain that we propose runs from ROE maximization to asset growth to lower <b>interest</b> <b>margins.</b> The key difference with the traditional explanation is that banks'' quest for growth, not the level of competition in traditional retail segments, has transformed banks'' balance sheets and reduced <b>interest</b> <b>margins.</b> Underlying this transformation is the strategic shift from relationship to transaction banking.

This paper investigates the determinants of banks’ <b>interest</b> <b>margins</b> in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE).

We document that, in contrast to the literature, foreign ownership has a positive effect on <b>interest</b> <b>margins,</b> whereas state ownership proves to be irrelevant. Banks’ pricing of loans and deposits, however, is risk-adjusted in CEE – we detect positive risk premia for both interest and credit risk. However, our data provide some evidence for moral hazard behavior.

50|$|Example:Suppose {{the bank}} sells its IT {{installations}} for 40 million USD. With a reserve ratio of 10%, the bank can create 400 million USD in additional loans (there {{is a time}} lag, and the bank has to expect to recover the loaned money back into its books). The bank can often lend (and securitize the loan) to the IT services company to cover the acquisition cost of the IT installations. This can be at preferential rates, as the sole client using the IT installation is the bank. If the bank can generate 5% <b>interest</b> <b>margin</b> on the 400 million of new loans, the bank will increase interest revenues by 20 million. The IT services company is free to leverage their balance sheet as aggressively as they and their banker agree to. This is the reason behind the trend towards outsourcing in the financial sector. Without this money creation benefit, it is actually more expensive to outsource the IT operations as the outsourcing adds a layer of management and increases overhead.|$|E

40|$|Interest rate {{risk and}} bank net <b>interest</b> <b>margins</b> 1 Banks and their {{supervisors}} have spent considerable {{time and effort}} in recent years developing systems for monitoring and managing interest rate risk. 2 This special feature examines that specific component of interest rate risk arising from the possible effects of changes in market interest rates on bank net <b>interest</b> <b>margins.</b> Such effects can be very large if interest rate risk is not managed carefully. For example, the secondary banking crisis in the United Kingdom in the 1970 s reflected, at least in part, the funding of longer-term assets with short-term liabilities. 3 Similarly, funding of long-term, fixed rate mortgages with savings deposits led to a very sharp drop in net <b>interest</b> <b>margins</b> at US thrift institutions in the early 1980 s when interest rates rose to historic highs and the yield curve inverted. The result was actually negative net interest income for two years at US thrifts, after net <b>interest</b> <b>margins</b> had averaged nearly 1. 5 % over the preceding decade (FHLBB (1984)). By contrast, the results presented here suggest that commercial banks in the 10 industrial countries considered have generally managed their exposures to volatility in the yield curve in ways that have limited effects on their net <b>interest</b> <b>margins.</b> Thus, while fluctuations in net <b>interest</b> <b>margins</b> could be {{an important source of}} uncertainty in bank profitability – and could surely have adverse effects for particular institutions – changes in interest rates seem unlikely to undermine sharply the health of the banking sector through their effects on net interest income. The next section provides background on interest rate risk at banks, and discusses methods for assessing it. Given data limitations, the approach taken here focuses on the effects of market interest rates on the average yields on bank assets and liabilities and also on bank net <b>interest</b> <b>margins.</b> The subsequent section reports on the empirical findings. A final section provides some concluding remarks and caveats. 1 The views expressed in this article are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of the BIS.
