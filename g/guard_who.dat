5|$|Diocletian {{reformed}} {{the provincial}} administration, establishing a three-tiered provincial hierarchy, {{in place of}} the previous single-tier structure. The original 42 provinces of the Principate were almost tripled in number to c. 120. These were grouped into 12 divisions called dioceses, each under a vicarius, in turn grouped into 4 praetorian prefectures, to correspond to the areas of command assigned to the four Tetrarchs, who were each assisted by a chief-of-staff called a praefectus praetorio (not be confused with the commanders of the Praetorian <b>Guard,</b> <b>who</b> held the same title). The aim of this fragmentation of provincial administration was probably to reduce the possibility of military rebellion by governors (by reducing the forces they each controlled).|$|E

Guard implicitly disparaged Shane's current group, and Shane asserted a distaste for performing again with <b>Guard,</b> <b>who</b> had spent the intervening decades living and performing in Australia, touring sporadically as a soloist, and writing about and teaching music. Despite the unpleasantness, Shane and Guard reconciled to a large degree (even to the point of planning a possible reunion tour) prior to Guard's death at age 56 from lymphoma nine years later in March 1991.|$|E

The soldiers fired on the men breaking into the church, who promptly retreated. After retreating, the nativists negotiated with the <b>guard,</b> <b>who</b> agreed to withdraw, allowing the nativists to guard the church. Responding to being pelted with rocks as they left, some soldiers fired back on the crowd, which only incited the mob further.
