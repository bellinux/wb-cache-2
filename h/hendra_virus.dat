5|$|Grey-headed {{flying foxes}} {{are exposed to}} several threats, {{including}} loss of foraging and roosting habitat, competition with the black flying fox, and mass die-offs caused by extreme temperature events. When present in urban environments, grey-headed flying foxes are sometimes perceived as a nuisance. Cultivated orchard fruits are also taken, but apparently only at times when other food items are scarce. Because their roosting and foraging habits bring the species into conflict with humans, they suffer from direct killing of animals in orchards and harassment and destruction of roosts. Negative public perception of the species has intensified {{with the discovery of}} three recently emerged zoonotic viruses that are potentially fatal to humans: <b>Hendra</b> <b>virus,</b> Australian bat lyssavirus and Menangle virus. However, only Australian bat lyssavirus is known from two isolated cases to be directly transmissible from bats to humans. No person has ever died from ABLV (Lyssavirus) after having had the ABLV post-exposure vaccine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hendra</b> <b>virus</b> (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) in {{the genus}} Henipavirus {{have emerged in}} humans and {{livestock}} in Australia and Southeast Asia. Both viruses are contagious, highly virulent, and capable of infecting a number of mammalian species and causing potentially fatal disease. Due {{to the lack of}} a licensed vaccine or antiviral therapies, HeV and NiV are designated as biosafety level (BSL) 4 agents. The genomic structure of both viruses is that of a typical paramyxovirus.|$|E
25|$|Biosafety-level-4 {{laboratories}} {{are used}} for diagnostic work and research on easily transmitted pathogens which can cause fatal disease. These include a number of viruses known to cause viral hemorrhagic fever such as Marburg virus, Ebola virus, Lassa virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. Other pathogens handled at BSL-4 include <b>Hendra</b> <b>virus,</b> Nipah virus, and some Flaviviruses. Additionally, poorly characterized pathogens which appear closely related to dangerous pathogens are often handled at this level until sufficient data are obtained either to confirm continued work at this level, or {{to work with them}} at a lower level. This level is also used for work with Variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, though this work can only be done at the World Health Organization approved facilities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, U.S.A., as well as the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology in Koltsovo, Russia.|$|E

30|$|Illegal {{importation}} of game from African countries seized at Paris Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport was also seen {{to pose a}} serious risk. The illegal trade was estimated at five tonnes a week in this airport alone (Chaber et al. 2010). As well as the conservation question, wild animals and their products may disseminate diseases such as Ebola haemorrhagic fever virus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), monkeypox, Nipah and <b>Hendra</b> <b>viruses,</b> as well as West Nile virus. There has been a worldwide increase in the occurrence of these diseases recently, as well as tuberculosis, rabies and brucellosis (Travis et al. 2011).|$|R
5|$|Bats {{are natural}} {{reservoirs}} {{for a large}} number of zoonotic pathogens, including rabies, histoplasmosis both directly and in guano, Nipah <b>Hendra</b> <b>viruses,</b> and possibly ebola virus. Their high mobility, broad distribution, long life spans, substantial sympatry, and social behaviour make bats favourable hosts and vectors of disease. Compared to rodents, bats carry more zoonotic viruses per species, and each virus is shared with more species. They seem to be highly resistant to many of the pathogens they carry, suggesting a degree of adaptation to bats' immune systems. Furthermore, their interactions with livestock and pets, including predation by vampire bats, accidental encounters, and the scavenging of bat carcasses, compound the risk of zoonotic transmission.|$|R
40|$|Bats are {{sources of}} high viral {{diversity}} and high-profile zoonotic viruses worldwide. Although apparently not patho-genic in their reservoir hosts, some viruses from bats se-verely affect other mammals, including humans. Examples include {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} coronaviruses, Ebola and Marburg viruses, and Nipah and <b>Hendra</b> <b>viruses.</b> Factors underlying high viral diversity in bats {{are the subject}} of speculation. We hypothesize that flight, a factor common to all bats but to no other mammals, provides an intensive selective force for coexistence with viral parasites through a daily cycle that elevates metabolism and body temperature analogous to the febrile response in other mammals. On an evolutionary scale, this host–virus interaction might have resulted in the large diversity of zoonotic viruses in bats, possibly through bat viruses adapting to be more tolerant o...|$|R

40|$|Nipah and <b>Hendra</b> <b>viruses</b> are {{emergent}} paramyxoviruses, causing disease {{characterized by}} rapid onset and high mortality rates, resulting in their classification as Biosafety Level 4 pathogens.

Here we report crystal structures of both Nipah and Hendra attachment glycoproteins in complex with human EFNB 2. In contrast to previously solved paramyxovirus attachment complexes, which are mediated by sialic acid interactions, the Nipah and Hendra complexes are maintained by an extensive protein-protein interface, including a crucial phenylalanine side chain on EFNB 2 that fits snugly into a hydrophobic pocket on the viral protein. By analogy with the development of antivirals against sialic acid binding viruses, these results provide a structural template to target antiviral inhibition of protein-protein interactions...|$|R
40|$|Measles {{virus is}} a negative-sense, {{single-stranded}} RNA virus within theMononegavirales order,which includes several human pathogens, including rabies, Ebola, Nipah, and <b>Hendra</b> <b>viruses.</b> Themeasles virus nucleoprotein {{consists of a}} structured N-terminal domain, and of an intrinsically disordered C-terminal domain, NTAIL (aa 401 – 525), which undergoes induced folding {{in the presence of}} the C-terminal domain (XD, aa 459 – 507) of the viral phosphoprotein. With in NTAIL, an α-helical molecular recognition element (α-MoRE, aa 488 – 499) involved in binding to P and in induced folding was identified and then observed in the crystal structure of XD. Using small-angle X-ray scattering, we have derived a low-resolution structural model of the complex between XD and NTAIL, which shows that most of NTAIL remains disordered in the complex despite P-induced folding within the α-MoRE. The model consists of an extended shape accommodating the multiple conformations adopted by the disordered N-terminal region of NTAIL, and of a bulky globular region, corresponding to XD and to the C terminus of NTAIL (aa 486 – 525). Using surface plasmon resonance, circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy, and heteronuclear magnetic resonance, we show that NTAIL has an additional site (aa 517 – 525) involved in binding to XD but not in the unstructured-to-structured transition. This work provides evidence that intrinsically disordered domains can establish complex interactions with their partners, and can contact them through multiple sites that do not all necessarily gain regular secondary structure...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{capacity}} of a virus to cross species barriers {{is determined by the}} development of bona fide interactions with cellular components of new hosts, and in particular its ability to block IFN-α/β antiviral signaling. Tioman virus (TioV), a close relative of mumps virus (MuV), has been isolated in giant fruit bats in Southeast Asia. Nipah and <b>Hendra</b> <b>viruses,</b> which are present in the same bat colonies, are highly pathogenic in human. Despite serological evidences of close contacts between TioV and human populations, whether TioV is associated to some human pathology remains undetermined. Here we show that in contrast to the V protein of MuV, the V protein of TioV (TioV-V) hardly interacts with human STAT 2, does not degrade STAT 1, and cannot block IFN-α/β signaling in human cells. In contrast, TioV-V properly binds to human STAT 3 and MDA 5, and thus interferes with IL- 6 signaling and IFN-β promoter induction in human cells. Because STAT 2 binding was previously identified as a host restriction factor for some Paramyxoviridae, we established STAT 2 sequence from giant fruit bats, and binding to TioV-V was tested. Surprisingly, TioV-V interaction with STAT 2 from giant fruit bats is also extremely weak and barely detectable. Altogether, our observations question the {{capacity of}} TioV to appropriately control IFN-α/β signaling in both human and giant fruit bats that are considered as its natural host...|$|R

40|$|Bats {{have long}} been known to host many {{infectious}} agents. This is unsurprising, as to date, viruses from over 60 groups {{have been reported in}} bats. Many of the pathogens are an extreme public health risk as they lead to diseases that result in fatal encephalitides (rabies, Nipah, <b>Hendra</b> <b>viruses)</b> and hemorrhagic fevers (Marburg, Ebola viruses). Even more worrisome, recent disease surveillance in various regions (such as Kenya, Uganda, Bangladesh, Peoples Republic of China), have shown species of bats to be hosts of emerging infectious pathogens that have been proven a public health threat to the people they live among (example: the SARs 2003 outbreak in China, Marburg fever outbreaks in Africa, Nipah encephalitis outbreaks in Bangladesh). In this modern world with increased mobility of animals, animal products, and people, evidence of a pathogen at a certain location could potentially pose a larger global threat. These field surveys were under taken during 2006 - 2009 with partial support from the Global Disease Detection Program and O. C. Hubert Fellowship in International Public Health and Epidemiology – from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (4, 2). By collecting a selected sample size of various bat species throughout the southern half of Kenya, we are looking for novel emerging and re-emerging pathogens, trying to better understand their pathobiology, distribution and circulation patterns, and the existing and potential threat for veterinary and public health, {{as well as for the}} bat populations...|$|R
