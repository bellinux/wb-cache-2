500|$|By December 1972, having {{recorded}} Machine Head, Made in Japan and the yet to {{be released}} Who <b>Do</b> <b>We</b> <b>Think</b> We Are with Deep Purple, Gillan finally decided the workload had driven him to exhaustion. Unlike some band members, he was unhappy about Made in Japan, and disliked live albums in general. He tended {{to go into the}} studio after the rest of the band had recorded and finished the backing tracks, particularly for Who <b>Do</b> <b>We</b> <b>Think</b> We Are, to lay down his vocals separately. He had been continually at loggerheads with Blackmore, disagreeing about music regularly, which culminated in Gillan writing [...] "Smooth Dancer" [...] about him. While on tour in Dayton, Ohio, he sat down and wrote a resignation letter to the band's managers, stating he intended to leave the band, effective from 30 June 1973.|$|E
500|$|Several {{songs and}} {{scenes from the}} show address racial issues. [...] "Colored Spade", which {{introduces}} the character Hud, a militant black male, is {{a long list of}} racial slurs ("jungle bunny... little black sambo") topped off with the declaration that Hud is the [...] "president of the United States of love". At the end of his song, he tells the tribe that the [...] "boogie man" [...] will get them, as the tribe pretends to be frightened. [...] "Dead End", sung by black tribe members, is a list of street signs that symbolize black frustration and alienation. One of the tribe's protest chants is [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> is really great? To bomb, lynch and segregate!" [...] "Black Boys/White Boys" [...] is an exuberant acknowledgement of miscegenation; the U.S. Supreme Court had struck down laws against the practice in 1967. [...] Another of the tribe's protest chants is [...] "Black, white, yellow, red. Copulate in a king-sized bed." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in the UK in December 1972, with a special offer price of £3.10, {{the same as a}} typical single LP from that period. It reached number 16 in the charts. The cover was designed by Glover and featured a colour photo of the band on the front and rear covers, and black and white photos in the inside gatefold. The release in the US was delayed until April 1973, because Warner Bros. wanted to release Who <b>Do</b> <b>We</b> <b>Think</b> We Are first. They were motivated into releasing it due to a steady flow of UK imports being purchased, and it was an immediate commercial success, reaching number 6 in the charts. Warner Brothers also released [...] "Smoke on the Water" [...] as a single, coupling the live recording on Made in Japan with the studio version on Machine Head, and it reached number 4 in the Billboard charts. A recording of [...] "Black Night" [...] from the Tokyo gig, one of the encores that was not on the album, was released as the B-side to the single [...] "Woman from Tokyo" [...] in Europe, and as a single in its own right in Japan.|$|E
2500|$|The classic Deep Purple Mark II line-up {{continued}} to work, and released the album Who <b>Do</b> <b>We</b> <b>Think</b> We Are in 1973. Spawning the hit single [...] "Woman from Tokyo", the album hit number 4 in the UK charts and number 15 in the US charts while achieving gold record status {{faster than any}} Deep Purple album released up to that time. But internal tensions and exhaustion were more noticeable than ever. Following the successes of Machine Head and Made in Japan, the addition of Who <b>Do</b> <b>We</b> <b>Think</b> We Are made them the top-selling artists of 1973 in the US.|$|E
2500|$|Ian Gillan {{admitted}} in a 1984 {{interview that the}} band was pushed by management to complete the Who <b>Do</b> <b>We</b> <b>Think</b> We Are album on time and go on tour, although they badly needed a break. The bad feelings, including tensions with Blackmore, culminated in Gillan, followed by Glover, quitting the band after their second tour of Japan {{in the summer of}} 1973. In interviews years later, Jon Lord called the departure of Gillan and Glover while the band was at its peak [...] "the biggest shame in rock and roll; God knows what we would have become over the next three or four years." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, as {{the company}} was celebrating its 50th year, the Second City was awarded an honorary Jeff for the milestone, as well as three awards for the e.t.c.' s 33rd revue Studs Terkel's Not Working, {{recognizing}} director Matt Hovde and actress Amanda Blake Davis and naming it Best Revue. In 2011, the e.t.c.'s 35th revue Sky's the Limit (Weather Permitting) won the Jeff for Best New Work (Musical or Revue), as well Best Revue and Best Actor, for ensemble member Tim Baltz. The following year, the e.t.c.'s 36th revue We're All In This (Room) Together won for Best Revue and Best Director of a Revue (Ryan Bernier), while ensemble member Edgar Blackman took home the Jeff for Best Actor/Actress in a Revue {{for his work in}} Who <b>Do</b> <b>We</b> <b>Think</b> We Are? on the Second City mainstage. In 2013, the Jeff Awards awarded Best Production: Revue to a Second City show not housed at the venue on Wells Street, The Second City Guide to Opera, a collaboration with the Lyric Opera of Chicago that had been initiated by soprano and Lyric creative consultant [...] Renée Fleming, with Best Director: Revue going to Billy Bungeroth.|$|E

It crashes, of course, and Sophie is badly injured." [...] Carena Crawford from All About Soap commented [...] "Wow, Neighbours {{was more than a}} little bit dramatic today with the big car crash putting Sophie's life in danger – will she survive?" [...] The writer went on to say that the accident would have [...] "far-reaching consequences for everybody" [...] and tried to work out who was to blame, before adding [...] "Whoever's fault it is, we can't wait to see what happens next!" [...] A reporter for the TVTimes stated [...] "With more road accidents in this patch of Oz than anywhere else in the world, Sophie is asking for trouble when she piles into Chris's car, which is already overloaded with teenagers thanks to Andrew egging him on." [...] Dianne Butler, writing for news.com.au, thought the police did [...] "a half-baked investigation into the car crash", enabling Paul to sue Chris. The storyline was included in the Inside Soap Yearbook 2013 as one of [...] "The best bits of September". It was also named [...] "Crash of the month". The crash was nominated for Best Storyline in Digital Spy's end of year reader poll for 2012, it received 5.5% of the vote.|$|E

60|$|Oh, how unworthy are we of this love! How little <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> of it!

6000|$|... "May you not {{possibly}} mistake, my lord? for I do {{not so much}} quote Bardianna, as Bardianna quoted me, though he flourished before me; and no vanity, but honesty to say so. The catalogue of true thoughts is but small; they are ubiquitous; no man's property; and unspoken, or bruited, are the same. When we hear them, why seem they so natural, receiving our spontaneous approval? why <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> we have heard them before? Because they but reiterate ourselves; they were in us, before we were born. The truest poets are but mouth-pieces; and some men are duplicates of each other; I see myself in Bardianna." ...|$|E

"He {{exhibits}} all {{the symptoms}} of a panic of terror; he sees himself in some incomprehensible danger; he is frantic at one moment and servile at the next; he must and will know what this disturbing person really means. And when he is informed on that point, he first turns pale and doubts the evidence of his own senses; and next, with nothing said to justify it, gratuitously accuses his visitor of suspecting somebody. Query here: When a small sum of money is missing in a household, and the servants in general are called together to be informed of the circumstance, what <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> of the one servant in particular who speaks first, and who says, 'Do you suspect me?'" ...|$|E
60|$|Let us {{consider}} {{the significance of}} Gandia's tied hands and the wounds upon his body {{in addition to the}} mortal gash across his throat. To what does this condition point? Surely not to a murder of expediency so much as to a fierce, lustful butchery of vengeance. Surely it suggests that Gandia may have been tortured before his throat was cut. Why else were his wrists pinioned? Had he been swiftly done to death {{there would have been no}} need for that. Had hired assassins done the work they would not have stayed to pinion him, nor <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> they would have troubled to fling him into the river; they would have slain and left him where he fell.|$|E
60|$|And--it {{is so hard}} now {{to convey}} these things--he spoke to me, a stranger, without reservations, carelessly, as men now speak to men.

6000|$|Though bitter in his enmities, Lee had his friendships, and {{was warm}} and {{constant}} in them {{as far as his}} capricious humors would allow. There was nothing crafty or mean in his character, nor <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> he ever engaged in the low intrigues of the cabal; but he was a disappointed and embittered man, and the gall of bitterness overflowed his generous qualities. In such a discordant state of feeling, he was not a man for the sweet solitude of the country. He became weary of his Virginia estate; though {{in one of the most}} fertile regions of the Shenandoah Valley. His farm was mismanaged; his agents were unfaithful; he entered into negotiations to dispose of his property, in the course of which he visited Philadelphia. On arriving there he was taken with chills, followed by a fever, which went on increasing in violence, and terminated fatally. A soldier even unto the end, warlike scenes mingled with the delirium of his malady. In his dying moments he fancied himself on the field of battle. The last words he was heard to utter were, [...] "Stand by me, my brave grenadiers!" ...|$|E
