Research contends, “Mindfulness-based approaches for adults are effective at enhancing mental health, but few controlled trials have evaluated their effectiveness among young people”. Although much of the available studies find {{a high number of}} mindfulness acceptability among students and teachers, more research needs to be conducted on its <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>well-being</b> and mental-health for students. A firmly controlled experiment, Johnson, Burke, Brinkman, and Wade evaluated “the impact of an existing and widely available school-based mindfulness program, no improvements were demonstrated on any outcome measured either immediately post intervention or at three-month follow-up”. Many questions remain on which practices best implement effective and reliable mindfulness programs at schools, and {{further research is needed to}} identify the optimal methods and measurement tools for mindfulness in education.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the first}} 40 minutes, it is {{reportedly}} possible to experience itching {{in various parts}} of the body (a phenomenon also reported to be common during the early stages of meditation). The last 20 minutes often end with a transition from beta or alpha brainwaves to theta, which typically occur briefly before sleep and again at waking. In a float tank, the theta state can last for several minutes without the subject losing consciousness. Some use the extended theta state as a tool for enhanced creativity and problem solving. Spas sometimes provide commercial float tanks for use in relaxation. Flotation therapy has been academically studied in the US and in Sweden with published results showing reductions of both pain and stress. [...] The relaxed state also involves lowered blood pressure, lowered levels of cortisol and maximal blood flow. Apart from physiological effects, REST seems to have positive <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>well-being</b> and performance.|$|E

Interestingly, activities requiring change can have a negative <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>well-being,</b> except in psychological illnesses, where the opposite is true. The authors conclude with theoretical and managerial implications, highlighting that if interactions and activities with medical professionals are supplemented with customer-directed activities, the positive <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>well-being</b> is significantly enhanced...|$|R

Immediately prior to obtaining results of follow-up assessment, 178 women completed measures of emotional well-being, stress appraisal, coping strategies and social support.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the <b>effect</b> of retirement <b>on</b> psychological <b>well-being.</b> Findings from previous research in this field are inconsistent, as both positive, negative, and sometimes no <b>effect</b> of retirement <b>on</b> <b>well-being</b> is reported. In the paper we suggest that the divergent results may arise from the mixing of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, problems with the size and quality of existing longitudinal data, and the statistical methods used to analyze the impact of retirement <b>on</b> <b>well-being.</b> In the paper we propose to deploy the fixed-effect estimator whichs provides consistent estimates of the <b>effect</b> of retirement <b>on</b> <b>well-being,</b> even when retirement is correlated with other observed and unobserved explanatory variables. Using a large (N = 4, 634) and nationally representative panel data set with elderly Danish respondents, we find that retirement does not have any significant <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>well-being.</b> When estimating separate model for men and women we find indications (p =. 06) that men experience a decline in well-being as a consequence of retirement, while women are unaffected by retirement. Our findings for men would substantiate the crisis theory perspective that holds that retirement implies a loss of important social roles associated with labor market participation. Several suggestions for future research are also discussed. retirement; psychological well-being; gender; methodology; fixed-effect model...|$|R

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} examine the types of coping {{strategies}} preferred by adolescent competition tennis players and specific {{attention was paid to}} understanding these strategies’ perceived effectiveness and the coping strategy’s subsequent <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>well-being.</b> The sample for the study was made up of 27 adolescent tennis players {{with a mean age of}} 15 years who participate at a high competitive level. The Approach to Coping in Sport Questionnaire (ACSQ- 1) was used to measure the coping strategy used by the players and their psychological well-being was assessed by the Psychological Well-Being Scale. The results indicated that the emotional calming strategy was the tennis players’ preferred coping strategy in general. At the same time, emotional calming and active planning were the strategies the players’ considered to be the most effective in terms of improving performance. An additional finding was that players with lower levels of self-acceptance relied more heavily on the emotional calming strategy and those with higher levels of self-acceptance used mental distancing more frequently. Players who perceived greater environmental control relied more heavily upon mental distancing as their preferred coping strategy. These findings indicate that individual differences were present in terms of preferred coping strategies and that the strategies produced differentiated <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>well-being</b> for young competition tennis players...|$|E
30|$|Table 14 {{estimates}} {{the effect of}} unemployment duration <b>on</b> <b>well-being</b> using a fixed-effect logit. Using pooled data in specifications (1) to (3) and an interaction term between unemployment and its duration, I found that unemployment duration is positively associated to well-being. However, if one controls for individual fixed-effects – in specifications (4) to (6) – then duration is no longer associated to well-being. This hints {{at the fact that}} duration is associated with the individual fixed-effects but not directly with well-being. The transition matrix shown before provides evidence that staying in unemployment has no different <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>well-being</b> than staying in employment. The panel specifications (4 to 6) regress the change in well-being to the change in unemployment duration. The results show that the coefficient of duration is not significant. Hence, {{it can be said that}} the <b>effect</b> of unemployment <b>on</b> <b>well-being</b> is independent from its duration.|$|R

One reason for this are ambivalent effects of innovations on well-being that result from pecuniary and technological externalities of innovations, argued to be inevitable. Another major reason lies in the fact that, as a result of innovations, preferences can change over time. Under such conditions, a time-consistent measuring rod for changes in well-being is hard to construct. Existing conceptions of well-being are shown not yet to solve the problem in a way that provides an unambiguous answer to the question in the title...|$|E

Loss aversion, whereby losses loom larger than gains, is typically examined in relation to decisions about anticipated outcomes.

The aim {{of this paper is to}} examine the determinants of well-being of urban households in Sri Lanka. The sample of the study consisted with randomly selected 132 household heads from Matale municipal area, Central Province in Sri Lanka. A structured questionnaire and interviews were used to collect data from respondents. Descriptive statistical methods and logistic regression model were used to identify factors affecting household’s well-being. Three separate regressions are estimated for general happiness, feeling of prosperous household, and satisfaction with the living environment. The results of logistic regression for general happiness reveals that savings with the formal financial sector, participation in the community activities, and network with outside community have a positive and significant <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>well-being</b> of households. Besides this individual’s feeling of their prosperousness discloses that savings with the formal financial sector and networks with outside community have a positive <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> <b>well-being</b> of individuals.

Four years of data from a large national panel survey show that consuming hedonic products has indirect <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> <b>well-being,</b> by improving consumers' satisfaction within relevant life domains.
