40|$|The {{modified}} Differential Pulse Coded Modulation (<b>DPCM)</b> <b>codec</b> with multi-rate processing {{has been}} shown to able to code source with monotonically decreasing spectrum efficiently at low bit rates [1]. A practical image coder is designed based on this approach. Two dimensional DPCM is used along with decimation and interpolation {{to reduce the number of}} transmitted samples. The decimation rate depends on the signal spectrum and the bit rate. Further bit rate reduction is achieved through adaptive entropy coding. Wiener filter is appended in the decoder for minimizing distortion caused by quantization noise. The decimation filter can be implemented using simple IIR filters. The necessary side information is low. Simulation results show that the coder is able to give good compression performance at low bit rates which is superior to conventional <b>DPCM</b> <b>codec</b> and JPEG. Subjective quality can be as good as JPEG 2000. While at very low bit rates the proposed codec is able to retain certain image characteristics better than JPEG 2000. 1...|$|E
40|$|A joint {{source channel}} coding scheme for error {{resilient}} image transmission is proposed. A practical image coder {{was introduced in}} [1] using modified Differential Pulse Coded Modulation (<b>DPCM)</b> <b>codec</b> with multi-rate processing and adaptive entropy coding. In this paper the residual redundancy of the prediction error image is exploited by using turbo codes for both data compression and er-ror protection. In the paper we deal with robust transmission of the source over a BSC channel, but {{the results can be}} easily extended for non binary channels. Note also that simple modification of the quantizer allows for progressive transmission and successive refinement of information. With properly chosen rate and punctur-ing, the system is able to approach the limit theoretically attainable and to outperform the separated approach that consists on the con-catenation of the system in [1] and the best turbo codes for the same spectral efficiency. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the temporal DPCM loop {{at the heart}} of most modern high performance video coders. Targeting low bitrate-low complexity video applications, it is shown that DPCM is inefficient in this region. The <b>DPCM</b> <b>codec</b> is analyzed in the low bitrate region and rate-distortion optimal modifications are proposed that do not violate the low complexity requirement. The proposed modifications involve negligible added complexity at the encoder and no added complexity at the decoder and are thus compatible with standard coders and bit streams. 1 Introduction Modern video coders are based on a Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM) loop (Figure 1). In order {{to take advantage of the}} temporal dependencies inherent in a video sequence, the frame to be coded is predicted from previously decoded frames using a motion compensating predictor. The resulting error frames are quantized and coded for transmission using a coder that removes the spatial redundancies. The use of previously decoded fram [...] ...|$|E
