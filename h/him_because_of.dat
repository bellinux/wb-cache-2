50|$|Genito-urinary {{work was}} {{extremely}} appealing to <b>him,</b> certainly <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his two skilled teachers Dr. Gouley and Dr. Fluhrer, {{but also the}} field of neurology and psychiatry was particularly fascinating to <b>him</b> too, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> its speculative sides. So he ended up taking surgery as a specialty.|$|R

5|$|In 1840 {{he wrote}} the first case report by a black doctor, which his {{associate}} John Watson read {{at a meeting of}} the New York Medical and Surgical Society. (It acknowledged Smith was qualified, but would not admit <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> racial discrimination.) Soon after, Smith published an article in the New York Journal of Medicine, the first by a black doctor in the US.|$|E
5|$|Perrins' {{supporters}} had gambled {{heavily on}} <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his reputation and {{his advantage in}} size. In the event {{it was a major}} supporter of Johnson, a Thomas Bullock, who gained; he won £20,000 (equivalent to £220,000 as of 2010) from his bets in favour of Johnson and gifted the victor £1,000.|$|E
5|$|Sameer (Salman Khan) is ill-tempered, with anger-management issues {{since his}} parents died during his childhood. When he beats up {{a group of}} goons who tried to assault his girlfriend Roma (Amrita Arora), she breaks up with <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his temper.

50|$|On 15 February 2006, Yang Kyung Kyu had {{the charge}} against <b>him</b> dropped <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{insufficient}} evidence.|$|R
50|$|Yurchenko {{apparently}} {{thought the}} KGB might treat <b>him</b> well <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{the cases of}} recent redefectors like Betov and Chebatriov.|$|R
50|$|On 20 April 2017, Vytautas Prienai-Birštonas {{registered}} <b>him</b> <b>because,</b> half <b>of</b> {{the team}} was injured, and by the LKL rules they can't sign any player who's older than 21 years old.|$|R
5|$|Tyler {{is buried}} in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia, near the gravesite of former President James Monroe. Tyler has since been the namesake of several U.S. locations, {{including}} the city of Tyler, Texas, named for <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{his role in the}} annexation of Texas.|$|E

He is reunited with his sister Claire, who cannot remember <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> memory damage caused by an Umbrella mind control device. He, Alice and Claire eventually defeat Albert Wesker and rescue imprisoned survivors being used for Umbrella's experiments. Miller said he prepared for the role by searching for images and videos of Chris on the Internet, as well as doing cardio for endurance.|$|E
5|$|Duvall, who had {{appeared}} in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), which Foote adapted from the Harper Lee novel, was involved in Tender Mercies as an actor and co-producer from its earliest stages. He said the script appealed to <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the basic values it underlined and because the themes were universal even though the story was local. Duvall felt it portrayed people from the central region of the United States without parodying them, as he said many Hollywood films tend to do. Duvall's early involvement led to rumors that he had requested Foote write the script for him, something that both men denied.|$|E
50|$|Arsenal and Chelsea both chased Jallow {{and they}} almost bought <b>him,</b> but <b>because</b> <b>of</b> {{troubles}} with the residence/work permit, Jallow {{did not become}} an Arsenal or Chelsea player.|$|R
60|$|The Analytical Chemist returning, {{everybody}} {{looks at}} <b>him.</b> Not <b>because</b> anybody {{wants to see}} <b>him,</b> but <b>because</b> <b>of</b> that subtle influence in nature which impels humanity to embrace the slightest opportunity of looking at anything, rather than the person who addresses it.|$|R
50|$|Semi ("Cicada") - An assassin first sent to {{kill the}} older Ando, but spared <b>him</b> instead <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his {{assassination}} contract being cancelled. He is the protagonist for the spin-off Waltz.|$|R
5|$|Of {{the eleven}} poems the Gosen Wakashū {{attributed}} to Narihira, several were really by others—for example, two were actually by Fujiwara no Nakahira {{and one by}} Ōshikōchi no Mitsune. The Shin Kokinshū and later court anthologies attribute more poems to Narihira, {{but many of these}} were likely misunderstood to have been written by <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> their appearance in The Tales of Ise. Some of these were probably composed after Narihira's death. Combined, poems attributed to Narihira in court anthologies total 87.|$|E
5|$|Persistently {{hampered}} by ankle and back injuries, Meckiff aggregated only 19 first-class wickets at 40 for the summer. His best innings performance was 4/39 against Queensland {{and he was}} unable to claim more than five wickets in any single match. In one match against arch-rivals New South Wales, the Victorian took a total of 5/155, all of his wickets being Test batsmen. Meckiff was not selected for the Ashes tour. His lack of form saved the Australian selectors the difficult choice of whether to omit <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his action and avoid a potential run-in with umpires in England. Critics claimed that his new bowling action adopted in 1959–60 had made him legitimate but reduced his pace and effectiveness.|$|E
5|$|Questions about Modi's {{relationship}} with Muslims were also raised by many Western nations {{during his tenure}} as chief minister. Modi was barred from entering the United States by the State Department, {{in accordance with the}} recommendations of the Commission on International Religious Freedom formed {{under the aegis of the}} International Religious Freedom Act, the only person denied a US visa under this law. The UK and the European Union refused to admit <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> what they saw as his role in the riots. As Modi rose to prominence in India, the UK and the EU lifted their bans in October 2012 and March 2013, respectively, and after his election as prime minister he was invited to Washington.|$|E
50|$|Zamorano was {{the promotional}} {{face of the}} new Santiago, {{transport}} system, Transantiago, which has brought <b>him</b> criticism <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the system's starting failures; some even say his credibility may have been damaged.|$|R
50|$|On September 8, 2006 Indonesia {{formally}} requested {{access to}} Hambali {{to ensure a}} fair trial. The United States are reluctant to hand <b>him</b> over <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the lenient sentence Indonesia imposed on Bashir.|$|R

5|$|Reddy {{was born}} into a Telugu-speaking Hindu peasant family in Illur village, Madras Presidency (present-day Anantapur district, Andhra Pradesh) on 19 May 1913. He studied at the Theosophical High School at Adayar in Madras and later {{enrolled}} at the Government Arts College at Anantapur, an affiliate of the University of Madras, as an undergraduate.

5|$|This three-part finale to the Venom {{series was}} {{published}} between November 1997 and January 1998. The Overreach Committee (the organization {{in charge of}} Brock's clandestine agency) decides to terminate <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his brutal methods. Brock cuts the bomb from his chest, and uses it to escape. His escape brings him into a confrontation with Spider-Man. After a fight with Spider-Man and an injection of dopamine blockers by Agent Smith, Brock is separated from the symbiote (which is apparently killed when Brock is re-arrested). The final issue sees Brock recover some memory of his history with Spider-Man; {{he had lost his}} knowledge of the hero's secret identity in the Spider-Man/Venom single issue (December 1997).|$|E
5|$|After some time, {{they decided}} that the best method of {{featuring}} a vacuum bag {{was to have a}} cleaning lady vacuuming up the evidence. Whereas cleaning ladies had already been the murder victims of several previous episodes, here it seemed absolutely necessary if they wanted an episode to have a realistic plot. However, the writers believed that having a maid as the victim required a main character to work with in order to give some personal involvement. Monk was not considered mostly because he does not have a cleaning lady, and if he did, she would never be good enough for <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his germophobia and meticulousness. It was eventually decided that the maid would be Dr. Kroger's employee. The idea of having her work for Dr. Kroger was successful, because the writers had been looking to have an episode where Kamel would be the focus.|$|E
5000|$|After being {{bound in}} human form Itempas wandered until Oree took <b>him</b> in. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> his general {{contempt}} for mortal beings, he initially refuses to talk—leading Oree {{to call him}} [...] "Shiny" [...] <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the way his magic appears to her.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the south}} of France, wealthy American {{businessman}} Tony Newlander is fed up with life. It seems everyone is friendly with <b>him</b> only <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his money or influence, including his ex-wife Cecilia and his valet.|$|R
50|$|In 1787 Crome {{accepted}} professorship at the University of Giessen, partly {{offered to}} <b>him</b> partly <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his rhetorical talent. On the road, he briefly visited Weimar and met Christoph Martin Wieland and Johann Karl August Musäus.|$|R
5|$|At the Enriched Learning Center for Gifted Children, Bart feels out {{of place}} among the other {{students}} with advanced academic skills. Meanwhile, Marge attempts to stimulate Bart with a little culture by taking the family to the opera. However, this proves disastrous as Bart and Homer are quite disruptive, much to Lisa's joy. Ostracized by his brilliant classmates, Bart visits his former school, where his old friends reject <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his perceived intelligence. On the bright side, he enjoys newfound attention from Homer and he covers for them when Marge makes another attempt to stimulate Bart's brain by taking them to a film festival. After Bart's chemistry experiment explodes, filling the school lab with green goo, he confesses to Dr. Pryor that he switched tests with Martin. Dr. Pryor realizes that he was never a genius and has him readmitted to Springfield Elementary.|$|E
5|$|Carlotta {{continues}} to sing, {{but her voice}} croaks (as {{a result of the}} Phantom tampering with her throat spray) and the lead role is given to Christine. While the ballet is being performed, the Phantom, not realizing the performance change, encounters the chief stagehand Joseph Buquet and strangles him before hanging him from above, creating chaos. Christine flees to the roof with Raoul. She reveals to him that she has seen the Phantom's face and fears him, but also pities <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his sadness. Raoul tells Christine he loves her and will protect her forevermore. Christine returns his love, kissing him passionately and they both leave the roof. The Phantom, who witnessed the scene, becomes heartbroken. He then hears them both singing together. Growing furious at Raoul, he vows revenge on them both.|$|E
5|$|Consumed with remorse, {{the king}} sought {{to rectify the}} {{situation}} by arranging a marriage between his brother's orphaned son and Andriamanelo's own sister (the orphan's aunt), Rafotsindrindramanjaka. He declared that the child from this union would, if female, be wed to his own son Ralambo; if male, he would become Ralambo's successor. A girl was born, and she was promised to Ralambo as his future wife with the stipulation that the child born of their union would rule after Ralambo. In this way Andriamanelo established a tradition of succession that indirectly respected the queens' decree by ensuring that a child of his brother's line (and his own) would rule after <b>him.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> this decree, Ralambo's first son by his second wife was passed over {{in the line of}} succession in favor of Andrianjaka, Ralambo's son by Rafotsindrindramanjaka. Andriamanelo was also reportedly the first to formally establish the andriana as a caste of Merina nobles, thereby laying the foundation for a stratified and structured society. From this point forward, the term Hova was used to refer only to the non-noble free people of the society which would later be renamed Merina by Andriamanelo's son Ralambo.|$|E
50|$|We know <b>of</b> <b>him</b> almost solely <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his {{mention in}} Cicero's {{correspondence}} with Lucius Munatius Plancus.|$|R
60|$|The tin men {{returned}} this man's stare with interest, {{but they}} did not look away from <b>him</b> <b>because</b> neither <b>of</b> them seemed able to take his eyes off this Munchkin, who was remarkable in having one tin arm quite like their own tin arms.|$|R
25|$|A non-party {{dictator}} {{without a}} large body of supporters, Morínigo survived politically – despite many plots against <b>him</b> – <b>because</b> <b>of</b> his astute handling of an influential group of young military officers who held key positions of power.|$|R
