25|$|Boy racers are {{typically}} known for speeding away from traffic lights, playing loud music, and revving their engines rather than actual street racing. A typical boy racer {{is seen as}} a young man who sits very low <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> wears a beanie, baseball cap and/or hoodie.|$|E
25|$|A {{few minutes}} later, Moutardier found Reid leaning over <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat,</b> <b>and</b> unsuccessfully {{attempted}} {{to get his}} attention. After she {{asked him what he}} was doing, Reid grabbed at her, revealing one shoe in his lap, a fuse leading into the shoe, and a lit match. He was unable to detonate the bomb: perspiration from his feet dampened the TATP and prevented it from igniting.|$|E
25|$|He {{reached the}} semi-finals of the World Snooker Championship in 1978, {{at the age}} of 64, having {{defeated}} John Virgo 9–8, Dennis Taylor 13–9 and Patsy Fagan 13–10. His defeat by South African Perrie Mans saw Davis miss a crucial pink from its spot on the verge of pulling up to one frame behind at 15–16. This incident is of great note as his brother Joe was following each ball intently, swaying <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> almost falling into the gangway when his brother missed this key pot. After this frame Joe Davis was taken ill; he was rushed to hospital to undergo a six-and-a-half-hour operation, and died a few weeks later. So dramatic was the missed pink that it became known as 'the ball that killed Joe Davis'. Davis closed 1978 with a quarter-final appearance in the United Kingdom Professional Championship. He defeated veteran Yorkshireman John Dunning 9–2 before losing to Alex Higgins 9–4.|$|E

60|$|Peter, wot was {{standing}} by blinking and smiling, misunderstood 'im, and went back inside the pub. Ginger went arter 'im to fetch 'im back, and hearing a noise turned round and saw the cabman pulling Sam out o' the cab. He was {{just in time to}} shove 'im back agin, and for {{the next two or three}} minutes 'im and the cabman was 'ard at it. Sam was too busy holding 'is clothes on to do much, and twice the cabman got 'im 'arf out, and twice Ginger got him back agin and bumped 'im back <b>in</b> <b>'is</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> shut the door. Then they both stopped and took breath.|$|R
500|$|Returning to Australia, Lerew held various base {{commands}} including RAAF Station Townsville, RAAF Station Nowra in New South Wales, and Batchelor Airfield near Darwin, Northern Territory. He led No.7 Squadron, operating Bristol Beauforts out {{of first}} Nowra and then Townsville, from August to December 1942. He {{then returned to}} RAAF Station Laverton {{to take charge of}} No.1 Aircraft Depot (No.1 AD). Lerew's biographer, Lex McAulay, speculated of this quick succession of postings across the country: [...] "...it is easy to assume that this Wing Commander whose critical reports were seen by the War Cabinet, and who had twice escaped the enemy at close quarters, was not to be allowed personal contact with the media of the day until his experiences were no longer topical and were overtaken by more recent momentous events". Though degree-qualified in civil engineering, Lerew believed he was underused in the technical environment of No.1 AD, and sought another overseas posting. Nevertheless, his tenure at Laverton helped prepare him for his later flying safety work. In September 1943, he investigated the crash of a Vultee Vengeance flown by an experienced aviator, and found that when rolling the aircraft to the right it was possible for the pilot's movements to release his safety harness, making it impossible for him to remain <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> control the aircraft. Lerew designed and developed a clip to prevent a recurrence of this mishap, which was later adopted worldwide for all such harnesses.|$|E
2500|$|Clinging to {{the tail}} {{section of the}} broken {{airliner}} in the ice-choked Potomac River were flight attendant Kelly Duncan and five passengers: Patricia [...] "Nikki" [...] Felch, Joe Stiley, Roger Olian, Arland D. Williams Jr. (strapped and tangled <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat)</b> <b>and</b> Priscilla Tirado. Duncan inflated the only flotation device they could find and passed it to the severely injured Felch. [...] Passenger Bert Hamilton, who was floating in the water nearby, {{was the first to}} be pulled from the water.|$|E
2500|$|George Edmondson (a.k.a. [...] "Mr. Two Bits"), {{wearing his}} {{trademark}} yellow oxford shirt, blue seersucker trousers, orange-and-blue tie, and black-and-white saddle shoes, {{traveled around the}} stands for almost 60 years leading fans in the old [...] "Two Bits" [...] cheer ("Two bits! [...] Four bits! [...] Six bits! [...] A dollar! [...] All for the Gators, stand up and holler!"). Edmondson began the tradition in 1949 and [...] "retired" [...] to become a regular fan after his fiftieth season in 1998. [...] However, he couldn't stay <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> continued to lead the cheer during pre-game festivities and (occasionally) in the stands during games. On November 22, 2008, at the last home game of the season, Mr. Two Bits was again honored with a retirement ceremony.|$|E

2500|$|The Department of the Environment {{report on}} the {{collision}} was published on 4 March 1976 and tests showed no equipment fault on the train. Postmortem evidence indicated that, {{at the time of}} impact, the driver's hand was on the [...] "dead man's handle", rather than {{in front of his face}} to protect it, implying he had made no attempt to stop. Witnesses were interviewed; some passengers on the train reporting that the train accelerated when entering the station, and some witnesses standing in the station reported that the driver, 56-year-old Leslie Newson, was sitting upright <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> <b>and</b> looking straight ahead as the train passed through the station. The state of the motor-control gear, as found after the accident, indicated that power had been applied to the motors until within two seconds of the impact.|$|E

50|$|In the December 1910 general {{election}} North East Cork was won by Moreton Frewen (All-for-Ireland League) but his senior party colleague Tim Healy lost in North Louth.

However, he was unsuccessful <b>in</b> holding <b>his</b> <b>seat,</b> <b>and</b> retired from South Australian politics.|$|R
60|$|The {{day after}} he sat down <b>in</b> <b>his</b> old <b>seat,</b> <b>and</b> when she came up said good-evening {{as though he had}} not ignored her for a week.

At that time the musical comedy had lately leaped into public favour, and he was sure that Mildred would be delighted to go to one.|$|R
50|$|In 2000, a Conservative Councillor died, and a By-Election {{was called}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>seat</b> of Huntpsill <b>and</b> Pawlett.
