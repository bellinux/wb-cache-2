Vox's Lauren Williams credits the character with teaching [...] "me about feminism before <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was". Writing for Jezebel, Hilary Crosley Coker crowned Clair [...] "a Trojan Horse for" [...] both feminism and black feminism. Dubbing the character [...] "a bonafide feminist warrior", Daily Life Ruby Hamad praised Clair for teaching her [...] "that a woman is no less of a woman, {{a mother and a}} wife for working." [...] Slate critic Jason Bailey observed that, during The Cosby Shows initial run, critics and audiences were too busy commenting on the race of the sitcom's main characters to notice that Cosby had imbued his series with [...] "proud and vocal feminism" [...] in the form of Clair. According to Bailey, The Cosby Show was not only successful because Clair [...] "was a strong, liberated woman with a career"; she also [...] "had a husband and family who supported and valued her endeavors." [...] Dubbing Clair's influence on pop culture as [...] "one of TV’s great feminists" [...] the [...] "Other Huxtable Effect", Bailey concluded that the character's impact remains indisputable despite Cosby's recent sexual assault allegations, and thus maintains that The Cosby Shows legacy as a feminist series should not be discredited.|$|E

In an interview by 60 Minutes with Anderson Cooper, Chesney commented on the failed marriage. [...] "The only fraud that was committed was me thinking that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was like…that I really understood {{what it was like}} to be married, and I really didn't." [...] The annulment was finalized in late December 2005. Chesney's family still resides in east Tennessee.|$|E

2500|$|Beatty cast Keaton {{after seeing}} her in Annie Hall, {{as he wanted}} to bring her natural {{nervousness}} and insecure attitude to the role. The production of Reds was delayed several times following its conception in 1977, and Keaton almost left the project when she believed {{it would never be}} produced. Filming finally began two years later. In a 2006 Vanity Fair story, Keaton described her role as [...] "the everyman of that piece, as someone who wanted to be extraordinary but was probably more ordinary ... <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> felt like to be extremely insecure." [...] Assistant director Simon Relph later stated that Louise Bryant was one of Keaton's most difficult roles, and that [...] " [...] almost got broken." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Kim" [...] was {{the first}} song the rapper {{recorded}} for the album, shortly after finishing work on The Slim Shady LP in late 1998. Eminem wrote [...] "Kim" [...] {{at a time in}} which {{he and his wife were}} separated, and he had just watched a romantic movie alone at a theater. Originally intending to write a love song for her while using ecstasy, the rapper hoped to avoid overt sentimentality and thus began writing a song of hate. With the track, the rapper aimed to create a short horror story in the form of a song. Once the couple reconciled, Eminem recalls, [...] "I asked her to tell me what she thought of it. I remember my dumb ass saying, 'I know this is a fucked-up song, but it shows how much I care about you. To even think about you this much. To even put you on a song like this'. [...] " [...] The song [...] "Stan" [...] was produced by The 45 King. Eminem's manager, Paul Rosenberg, sent Eminem a tape of the producer's beats, and the second track featured a sample of English singer-songwriter Dido's [...] "Thank You". Upon hearing the song's lyrics, Eminem felt they described an obsessed fan, which became the inspiration for the song. The writing process for [...] "Stan" [...] differed greatly from Eminem's usual strategy, in which song concepts form during the writing: [...] "'Stan' was one of the few songs that I actually sat down and had everything mapped out for. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was going to be about. [...] " [...] Dido later heard [...] "Stan" [...] and enjoyed it, and observed, [...] "I got this letter out of the blue one day. It said, 'We like your album, we've used this track. Hope you don't mind, and hope you like it. ' When they sent [...] to me and I played it in my hotel room, I was like, 'Wow! This track's amazing. '" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1981, Jones met Nancy Sepulvado, a 34-year-old divorcée from Mansfield, Louisiana. [...] Sepulvado's {{positive}} impact on Jones' life and career cannot be overstated; she eventually cleaned up his finances, kept him away from his drug dealers (who reportedly kidnapped her daughter in retaliation), and managed his career. [...] Jones always gave her complete credit for saving his life. [...] Nancy, who did not drink, explained to Nick Tosches in 1994, [...] "He was drinking but he was fun to be around. [...] It wasn't {{love at first sight}} or anything like that. [...] But I saw what a good person he was, deep down, and I couldn't help caring about him." [...] Jones managed to quit cocaine but went on a drunken rampage in Alabama in fall 1983 and was once again straitjacketed and committed to Hillcrest Psychiatric Hospital suffering from malnutrition and delusions. [...] But by that time, physically and emotionally exhausted, he really did want to quit drinking. [...] In March 1984 in Birmingham, Alabama - at the age of 52 - Jones performed his first sober show since the early seventies. [...] "All my life it seems like I've been running from something," [...] he told the United Press International in June. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was, maybe I could run in the right direction. [...] But I always seem to end up going the other way." [...] Jones began making up many of the dates he had missed, playing them for free to pay back promoters, and began opening his concerts with [...] "No Show Jones", a song he had written with Glen Martin that poked fun at himself and other country singers. [...] Jones always stressed that he was not proud of the way he treated loved ones and friends over the years and was ashamed of disappointing his fans when he missed shows, telling Billboard in 2006 that [...] "I know it hurt my fans in a way and I've always been sad about that, it really bothered me for a long time." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1969, Haggard {{released}} [...] "Okie From Muskogee," [...] with lyrics ostensibly {{reflecting the}} singer's {{pride in being}} from Middle America where people are conventionally patriotic, don't smoke marijuana, don't take LSD, don't protest by burning draft cards or otherwise challenge authority. In the ensuing years, Haggard gave varying statements regarding whether he intended the song as a humorous satire or a serious political statement in support of conservative values. In a 2001 interview, Haggard called the song a [...] "documentation of the uneducated that lived in America at the time." [...] However, he made several other statements suggesting that he meant the song seriously. On the Bob Edwards Show, he said, [...] "I wrote it when I recently {{got out of the}} joint. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was like to lose my freedom, and I was getting really mad at these protesters. They didn't know anything more about the war in Vietnam than I did. I thought how my dad, who was from Oklahoma, would have felt. I felt I knew how those boys fighting in Vietnam felt." [...] In the country music documentary series Lost Highway, he elaborated: [...] "My dad passed away when I was nine, and I don't know if you've ever thought about somebody you've lost and you say, 'I wonder what so-and-so would think about this?' I was drivin' on Interstate 40 and I saw a sign that said '19 Miles to Muskogee.' Muskogee was always referred to in my childhood as 'back home.' So I saw that sign and my whole childhood flashed before my eyes and I thought, 'I wonder what dad would think about the youthful uprising that was occurring at the time, the Janis Joplins.... I understood 'em, I got along with it, but what if he was to come alive at this moment? And I thought, what a way to describe the kind of people in America that are still sittin' {{in the center of the}} country sayin', 'What is goin' on on these campuses?'" [...] In the American Masters documentary about him, he said, [...] "That's how I got into it with the hippies.... I thought they were unqualified to judge America, and I thought they were lookin' down their noses at something that I cherished very much, and it pissed me off. And I thought, 'You sons of bitches, you've never been restricted away from this great, wonderful country, and yet here you are in the streets bitchin' about things, protesting about a war that they didn't know any more about than I did. They weren't over there fightin' that war any more than I was." ...|$|E
