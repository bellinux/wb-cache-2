The compounds were then mixed, and multistep reactions were conducted to make enantiomers or analogs of the natural product mappicine.

40|$|Total syntheses of two 16 -member {{libraries}} of murisolin isomers are reported. In {{the first}} library, fluorous PMB (p-methoxybenzyl) groups encode configurations, and four mixtures of four dihydroxytetrahydrofurans are prepared by Shi epoxidation followed (optionally) by Mitsunobu reaction. The mixtures are coupled by Kocienski-Julia reaction {{with a single}} hydroxybutenolide followed by hydrogenation. Demixing and <b>detagging</b> provide the 16 pure stereoisomers. In the second synthesis, a single mixture of four fluorous-tagged dihydroxy-tetrahydrofurans is coupled with a four-compound mixture of hydroxybutenolides that bear derivatives of DMB (dimethoxybenzyl) groups with oligoethylene glycol (OEG) units that encode the configurations at C 4 and C 34.

40|$|Techniques of fluorous mixture {{synthesis}} {{have been}} used to make four candidate stereoisomers for the natural product lagunapyrone B. A quasiracemic mixture of vinyl iodides whose component configurations at C 19 - 21 were encoded by fluorous silyl groups was fused to a central fragment by a Negishi coupling. A separate quasiracemic mixture of pyrone fragments whose component configurations at C 6, 7 were also encoded by fluorous silyl groups was synthesized and demixed. Stille coupling of the resulting pure quasienantiomers with the quasiracemic mixture provided two quasi-diastereomeric samples, which were demixed and <b>detagged</b> to provide all four lagunapyrone B stereoisomers.

The resulting acrylate esters were combined in groups of three (one of each tag) and the resulting mixtures were reacted with a mixture of four thiols under standard conditions to effect conjugate addition. Analysis of the resulting libraries by fluorous hplc showed a primary separation based on the tag and revealed reliable secondary separations based on the thiol and the acrylate. The primary and secondary separations were used together in a preparative ‘mixture of mixtures’ experiment in which one of the tagged acrylate mixtures was reacted with a mixture of three thiols.

40|$|The {{concept of}} quasiracemic {{synthesis}} is introduced and illustrated with syntheses of both enantiomers of pyridovericin (whose absolute configuration is assigned as R) and mappicine. Like racemic synthesis, quasiracemic synthesis provides both enantiomers {{in a single}} synthetic sequence; however, separation tagging is used to ensure that quasiracemic mixtures can be analyzed, separated, and identified on demand. Fluorous tags of differing chain lengths are used to tag two enantiomeric starting materials. The resulting quasienantiomers are mixed to make a quasiracemate, which is then treated like a true racemate in successive steps of the synthesis. Fluorous chromatography is used to separate, or demix, the final quasiracemate into its two components, which are then <b>detagged</b> to provide (true) enantiomeric products. Quasiracemic synthesis is portrayed as the first and simplest {{of a series of}} mixture synthesis techniques based on separation tagging, and the prospects for using other types of separation tags are briefly evaluated...|$|R

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of a stereoisomer library of 16 murisolins in individual pure form by fluorous mixture synthesis is reported. Four stereoisomeric precursors are tagged with different fluorous tags, {{and the resulting}} mixture is taken through the synthesis with four splits and late stage demixing and <b>detagging</b> to give all 16 products. These products exhibit only six different sets of NMR spectra, but all can be differentiated by chiral HPLC. The structure of murisolin is confirmed, but the structures of murisolin A and 16, 19 -cis-murisolin may never be known with certainty because insufficient data were collected on natural samples to differentiate each of them from one other isomer.

40|$|In {{previous}} work we proved {{that for a}} SU(2,C) valued loop having the critical degree of smoothness (one half of a derivative in the L^ 2 Sobolev sense), the following are equivalent: (1) the Toeplitz and shifted Toeplitz operators associated to the loop are invertible, (2) the loop has a triangular factorization, and (3) the loop has a root subgroup factorization. For a loop g satisfying these conditions, the Toeplitz determinant <b>det(A(g)</b> A(g^{- 1 })) and shifted Toeplitz determinant det(A_ 1 (g) A_ 1 (g^{- 1 })) factor as products in root subgroup coordinates. In this paper we observe that, at least in broad outline, there is a relatively simple generalization to loops having values in SL(2,C). The main novel features are that (1) root subgroup coordinates are now rational functions, i. e. there is an exceptional set, and (2) the non-compactness of SL(2,C) entails that loops are no longer automatically bounded, and this (together with the exceptional set) complicates the analysis at the critical exponent.

40|$|Abstract. Foreground and {{background}} segmentation {{is a typical}} problem in computer vision and medical imaging. In this paper, we propose a new learning based approach for 3 D segmentation, and we show its application on colon <b>detagging.</b> In many problems in vision, both the foreground and the background observe large intra-class variation and inter-class similarity. This makes the task of modeling and segregation of the foreground and the background very hard. The framework {{presented in this paper}} has the following key components: (1) We adopt probabilistic boosting tree [9] for learning discriminative models for the appearance of complex foreground {{and background}}. The discriminative model ratio is proved to be a pseudo-likelihood ratio modeling the appearances. (2) Integral volume and a set of 3 D Haar filters are used to achieve efficient computation. (3) We devise a 3 D topology representation, grid-line, to perform fast boundary evolution. The proposed algorithm has been tested on over 100 volumes of size 500 × 512 × 512 at the speed of 2 ∼ 3 minutes per volume. The results obtained are encouraging. ...|$|E
40|$|Sch 725674 is a 14 -membered macrolactone {{isolated}} from the culture of an Aspergillus sp. by a group at Schering-Plough in 2005. A two-dimensional structure with four stereocenters was proposed for Sch 725674, leaving sixteen candidate stereostructures for the natural product. Herein, we report the fluorous mixture synthesis (FMS) of all sixteen candidate stereoisomers of Sch 725674 to determine its relative and absolute configuration. Initially, the synthesis of a single stereoisomer of Sch 725674 was executed to secure a route to the natural product and to confirm the 2 D connectivity of Sch 725674. The synthesis established in the single isomer pilot study was then applied to the FMS of the 4, 5 -trans-dihydroxy isomer family of Sch 725674, in which all eight members bear a trans relationship between the C 4 and C 5 stereocenters. An eight-member library of ring-open Sch 725674 analogs was also prepared by demixing and <b>detagging</b> two intermediate mixtures from the FMS of the 4, 5 -trans-dihydroxy isomer family. We then executed a second, parallel FMS of the 4, 5 -cis-dihydroxy family of Sch 725674, in which each member has a cis relationship between the C 4 and C 5 stereocenters. All three of these libraries employed a new minimalist tagging strategy which used two sorting tags in an FMS, only {{one of which was}} fluorous.

Retrosynthesis of the framework of tetrafibricin gives 6 fragments, C 1 -C 8, C 9 -C 13, C 14 -C 20, C 21 -C 30, C 31 -C 34 and C 35 -C 40. Chapter 2 describes the fluorous mixture synthesis of four stereoisomers of the C 21 ¨CC 40 fragment {{with the aid of}} fluorous tagging to encode configurations at C 37 and C 33. After demixing and <b>detagging,</b> the isomers were found to have substantially identical 1 H NMR spectra. However, there were some small but reliable differences in their 13 C NMR spectra. Chapter 3 describes efforts towards total synthesis of tetrafibricin. After making the 6 fragments, different sequences of fragment coupling by a series of Julia-Kocienski reactions were attempted. First the alkylation of dithiane C 9 -C 13 with iodide C 14 -C 20 provided C 9 -C 20 carbon skeleton. Then the first Julia-Kocienski olefination with sulfone C 21 -C 30 and aldehyde C 9 -C 20 gave olefin C 9 -C 30, which was then advanced to aldehyde to attempt another Julia-Kocienski olefination. Fragment C 31 -C 40 was also achieved by Julia-Kocienski olefination of sulfone C 35 -C 40 with aldehyde C 31 -C 34. Then the two big parts, aldehyde C 9 -C 30 and sulfone C 31 -C 40, were coupled together to afford fragment C 9 -C 40 by Julia-Kocienski olefination.

40|$|Types {{express a}} program's meaning, and {{checking}} types ensures that a program has the intended meaning. In a dependently typed programming language types are predicated on values, {{leading to the}} possibility of expressing invariants of a program's behaviour in its type. Dependent types allow us to give more detailed meanings to programs, and hence be more confident of their correctness. This thesis considers the practical implementation of a dependently typed programming language, using the Epigram notation defined by McBride and McKinna. Epigram is a high level notation for dependently typed functional programming elaborating to a core type theory based on Lu๙s UTT, using Dybjer's inductive families and elimination rules to implement pattern matching. This gives us a rich framework for reasoning about programs. However, a naive implementation introduces several run-time overheads since the type system blurs the distinction between types and values; these overheads include the duplication of values, and the storage of redundant information and explicit proofs. A practical implementation of any programming language should be as efficient as possible; in this thesis we see how the apparent efficiency problems of dependently typed programming can be overcome and that in many cases the richer type information allows us to apply optimisations which are not directly available in traditional languages. I introduce three storage optimisations on inductive families; forcing, <b>detagging</b> and collapsing. I further introduce a compilation scheme from the core type theory to G-machine code, including a pattern matching compiler for elimination rules and a compilation scheme for efficient run-time implementation of Peano's natural numbers. We also see some low level optimisations for removal of identity functions, unused arguments and impossible case branches. As a result, we see that a dependent type theory is an effective base on which to build a feasible programming language. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Chapter 1 of {{this thesis}} {{describes}} two new {{strategies for the}} solution phase mixture synthesis: OEG-mixture synthesis (OMS) and OEG-fluorous mixture synthesis (OFMS). An OEG-mixture synthesis of four stereoisomers of the hydroxybutenolide unit of murisolin was pursued. A strategy for solution phase stereoisomer synthesis based on orthogonal separation tagging and double demixing was implemented with fluorous (fluoroalkyl) and oligoethylene glycol (OEG, [OCH 2 CH 2]n) tags. A mixture of four stereoisomers of a dihydroxytetrahydrofuran subunit encoded by fluorous tags was coupled by a Kocienski-Julia olefination to a mixture of four stereoisomers of the hydroxybutenolide subunit encoded by OEG tags. An orchestrated sequence of reduction (1 x), OEG demixing (1 x), fluorous demixing (4 x) and <b>detagging</b> (16 x) provided sixteen stereoisomers of murisolin. Through this double tagging strategy, the configuration of sixteen compounds was encoded with only eight tags. Chapter 2 describes the synthesis of the C 1 -C 20 and C 21 -C 40 fragments of the natural product tetrafibricin. A convergent synthesis of the proposed structure of tetrafibricin has been explored. In this approach, we envisioned a series of the Kocienski-Julia olefination reactions with appropriate aldehydes and sulfones to afford fragments C 35 -C 40, C 31 -C 35 and C 21 -C 30. The synthesis of the C 35 -C 40 fragment has been achieved in 11 steps starting with the commercially available pent- 4 -en- 1 -ol in an overall 25 % yield. The synthesis of the C 31 -C 34 fragment commenced with the commercially available (S) - 2 -(2, 2 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -dioxolan- 4 -yl) ethanol in 5 steps in an overall 46 % yield. 16 steps are implemented in the synthesis of the C 21 -C 30 fragment in a 4. 5 % overall yield.
