25|$|Based on work in {{the late}} 1950s to the early 1960s, it has been {{technically}} possible to build spaceships with nuclear pulse propulsion engines, i.e. driven {{by a series of}} nuclear explosions. This propulsion system contains the prospect of very <b>high</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> (space travel's equivalent of fuel economy) and high specific power.|$|E
500|$|Because the SABRE engine {{uses the}} {{atmosphere}} as reaction mass at low altitude, {{it will have}} a <b>high</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> (around [...] for SABRE 4, or [...] for SABRE 3), and burn about one fifth of the propellant that would have been required by a conventional rocket. Therefore, Skylon would be able to take off with much less total propellant than conventional systems. The weight reduction enabled by the lower quantity of propellant needed meant that the vehicle would not require as much lift or thrust, which in turn permits the use of smaller engines and allows for the use of a conventional wing configuration. While flying within the atmosphere, the use of wings to counteract gravity drag is more fuel-efficient than simply expelling propellant (as in a rocket), which again serves to reduce the total amount of propellant needed. The payload fraction would be significantly greater than normal rockets and the vehicle should be fully reusable, capable of performing in excess of 200 launches.|$|E

5000|$|Hydrogen {{has nearly}} 30% <b>higher</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> (about 450 seconds vs. 350 seconds) than most dense fuels.|$|R
5000|$|A heavier engine with a <b>higher</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> {{may not be}} as {{efficient}} in gaining altitude, distance, or velocity as a lighter engine with a lower <b>specific</b> <b>impulse.</b>|$|R
50|$|These {{equations}} {{show that}} a <b>higher</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> means a more efficient rocket engine, capable of burning {{for longer periods of}} time. In terms of staging, the initial rocket stages usually have a lower <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> rating, trading efficiency for superior thrust in order to quickly push the rocket into higher altitudes. Later stages of the rocket usually have a <b>higher</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> rating because the vehicle is further outside the atmosphere and the exhaust gas does not need to expand against as much atmospheric pressure.|$|R
5000|$|Work {{began on}} a new {{generation}} of high-power electric propulsion and <b>high</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> with a new way to control the thrust vector.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the high}} exhaust {{velocities}} and the associated <b>high</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> and/or the high particle energy, two prime application areas emerge: spaceflight and coating of particular materials.For the spaceflight case, the <b>high</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> leads to 90% reduction in propellant consumption when comparing MOA to current state-of-the-art ion engines.For the coating case, the high kinetic energy of the exhaust particles leads to a high penetration depth within the target material. This allows for example to harden steel, aluminium and other metals, but also to change the material properties of glass and plastics.|$|E
5000|$|Air {{resistance}} and the engine's inability {{to keep a}} <b>high</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> at a fast burn rate are why all the propellant is not used as fast as possible.|$|E
50|$|Combustion light-gas {{guns are}} weaponised {{combustion}} cannons which burn a low-molecular-weight gas such as hydrogen {{to provide a}} <b>higher</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> than relatively high-molecular-weight conventional solid propellants.|$|R
50|$|Nuclear gas-core-reactor rockets {{can provide}} much <b>higher</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> than solid core nuclear rockets because their {{temperature}} limitations {{are in the}} nozzle and core wall structural temperatures, which are distanced from the hottest regions of the gas core. Consequently, nuclear gas core reactors can provide much higher temperatures to the propellant. Solid core nuclear thermal rockets can develop <b>higher</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> than conventional chemical rockets due to the low molecular weight of a hydrogen propellant, but their operating temperatures are limited by the maximum temperature of the solid core because the reactor's temperatures cannot rise above its components' lowest melting temperature.|$|R
50|$|Has a <b>higher</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> (change in {{momentum}} {{per unit}} of propellant) than a rocket engine; could provide between 1000 and 4000 seconds, while a rocket typically provides around 450 seconds or less.|$|R
50|$|To save weight, it {{is crucial}} for GEO {{satellites}} {{to have the most}} fuel-efficient propulsion system. Some modern satellites are therefore employing a <b>high</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> system like plasma or ion thrusters.|$|E
5000|$|... {{cryogenic}} oxygen-hydrogen {{combination system}} - Used in upper stages {{and sometimes in}} booster stages of space launch systems.This is a nontoxic combination. This gives <b>high</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> and is ideal for high-velocity missions ...|$|E
50|$|This enables {{development}} of unique composite 3d printed fuel enabling <b>high</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> (ISP) for a hybrid engine. ISP {{is a key}} performance parameter in rocketry. However low ISP has traditional been an inhibitor {{for the success of}} any major program featuring a hybrid-propellant rocket.|$|E
50|$|Hydrogen {{might seem}} the obvious fuel for SSTO vehicles. When burned with oxygen, {{hydrogen}} gives the <b>highest</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> of any commonly used fuel: around 450 seconds, compared {{with up to}} 350 seconds for kerosene.|$|R
50|$|The <b>highest</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> for a {{chemical}} propellant ever test-fired in a rocket engine was 542 seconds (5,320 m/s) with a tripropellant of lithium, fluorine, and hydrogen. However, this combination is impractical; see rocket fuel.|$|R
50|$|The AJ10-138 {{engine was}} {{originally}} developed for Vanguard and Able, and was flown from 1964 to 1980.Two of these engines {{were used in}} the Titan III GTO Transtage, with thrust uprated from 3540 kgf to 3628 kgf, with <b>higher</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse.</b> Isp=311s.|$|R
50|$|The fission-fragment rocket is {{a rocket}} engine design that {{directly}} harnesses hot nuclear fission products for thrust, {{as opposed to}} using a separate fluid as working mass. The design can, in theory, produce very <b>high</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> while still being well within the abilities of current technologies.|$|E
50|$|PPTs {{are very}} robust {{due to their}} {{inherently}} simple design (relative to other electric spacecraft propulsion techniques). As an electric propulsion system, PPTs benefit from reduced fuel consumption compared to traditional chemical rockets, reducing launch mass and therefore launch costs, as well as <b>high</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> improving performance.|$|E
50|$|A {{propulsion}} {{system with a}} very <b>high</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> (that is, good efficiency {{in the use of}} reaction mass that must be carried along and used for propulsion on the journey) could accelerate more slowly producing useful levels of artificial gravity for long periods of time. A variety of electric {{propulsion system}}s provide examples. Two examples of this long-duration, low-thrust, high-impulse propulsion that have either been practically used on spacecraft or are planned in for near-term in-space use are Hall effect thrusters and Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rockets (VASIMR). Both provide very <b>high</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> but relatively low thrust, compared to the more typical chemical reaction rockets. They are thus ideally suited for long-duration firings which would provide limited amounts of, but long-term, milli-g levels of artificial gravity in spacecraft.|$|E
40|$|The highly {{successful}} demonstration of ion propulsion on Deep Space 1 has stimulated {{the study of}} more demanding applications of ion propulsion. These future applications require ion thrusters capable of providing significantly greater <b>specific</b> <b>impulses</b> and total impulses than the current state-of-the-art <b>Higher</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulses</b> aggravate the known wear out mechanisms of the ion accelerator system...|$|R
40|$|Historically, {{spacecraft}} {{reaction control}} systems have primarily utilized cold gas thrusters {{because of their}} inherent simplicity and reliability. However, cold gas thrusters typically have a low <b>specific</b> <b>impulse.</b> It has been determined that a <b>higher</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> {{can be achieved by}} passing a monopropellant fluid mixture through a catalyst bed prior to expulsion through the thruster nozzle. This research analyzes the potential efficiency improvements from using tri-gas, a mixture of hydrogen, oxygen, and an inert gas, which in this case is helium. Passing tri-gas through a catalyst causes the hydrogen and oxygen to react and form water vapor, ultimately heating the exiting fluid and generating a <b>higher</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse.</b> The goal of this project was to optimize the thruster performance by characterizing the effects of varying several system components including catalyst types, catalyst lengths, and initial catalyst temperatures...|$|R
50|$|The liquid {{rocket engine}} {{propellant}} combination of liquid oxygen and hydrogen offers the <b>highest</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> of currently used conventional rockets. This extra performance largely offsets {{the disadvantage of}} low density. Low density of a propellant leads to larger fuel tanks. However, a small increase in <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> in an upper stage application can have {{a significant increase in}} payload to orbit capability.|$|R
50|$|Based on work in {{the late}} 1950s to the early 1960s, it has been {{technically}} possible to build spaceships with nuclear pulse propulsion engines, i.e. driven {{by a series of}} nuclear explosions. This propulsion system contains the prospect of very <b>high</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> (space travel's equivalent of fuel economy) and high specific power.|$|E
50|$|Chemical-reaction monopropellants {{are not as}} {{efficient}} as some other propulsion technologies. Engineers choose monopropellant systems when the need for simplicity and reliability outweigh the need for high delivered impulse. If the propulsion system must produce large amounts of thrust, or have a <b>high</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse,</b> as on the main motor of an interplanetary spacecraft, other technologies are used.|$|E
50|$|The {{higher the}} {{specific}} impulse, the less propellant {{is needed to}} produce a given thrust during a given time. In this regard a propellant is more efficient the greater its specific impulse. This {{should not be confused}} with energy efficiency, which can decrease as specific impulse increases, since propulsion systems that give <b>high</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> require high energy to do so.|$|E
5000|$|Electric Herakles ion thrusters: {{multiple}} 30 kW <b>high</b> efficiency, <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> 7,000 s (69 kN·s/kg) ...|$|R
50|$|Ammonia {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a propellant. It offers <b>higher</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> than water, but is easily storable, with a boiling point of −77 degrees Celsius. The exhaust dissociates into hydrogen and nitrogen, leading to a lower average molecular weight, and thus a higher Isp (65% of hydrogen).|$|R
5000|$|A {{variety of}} other non-rocket {{propulsion}} methods, such as ion thrusters, give much <b>higher</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> but with much lower thrust; for example the Hall effect thruster on the SMART-1 satellite has a <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> of 1,640 s (16,100 m/s) but a maximum thrust of only 68 millinewtons. [...] The Variable <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> magnetoplasma rocket (VASIMR) engine currently in development will theoretically yield 20,000−300,000 m/s, and a maximum thrust of 5.7 newtons.|$|R
5000|$|Present {{telecommunication}} spacecraft platforms tend {{to benefit}} more from <b>high</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> than high thrust. The less fuel is consumed {{to get into}} orbit, the more is available for station keeping when on station. This increase in the remaining propellant can be directly translated {{to an increase in}} the service lifetime of the satellite, increasing the financial return on these missions.|$|E
50|$|The Nano {{electrokinetic}} thruster is {{a theoretical}} space propulsion {{system based on}} the principle of electro-osmosis (also electroosmotic flow). It allows for a <b>high</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> and high thrust-to-power ratio as well as a high final velocity which makes it suitable {{for a wide variety of}} applications. Due to difficulties in the production of the needed carbon nanotubes experimental testing has not yet started.|$|E
50|$|Planetary {{exploration}} spacecraft, {{especially the}} larger ones, tend to benefit more from high thrust than <b>high</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse.</b> The quicker a high delta-v manouevre can be executed, {{the higher the}} efficiency of this manouevre, and the less propellant is required. This reduction in the propellant required can be directly translated {{to an increase in}} the bus and payload mass (at design stage), enabling better science return on these missions.|$|E
50|$|All liquid rocket engines have tankage and pipes {{to store}} and {{transfer}} propellant, an injector system, a combustion chamber {{which is very}} typically cylindrical, and one (sometimes two or more) rocket nozzles. Liquid systems enable <b>higher</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> than solids and hybrid rocket engines and can provide very high tankage efficiency.|$|R
50|$|United States and Soviet space {{scientists}} in the early 1960s studied elemental fluorine as a possible rocket propellant because of the <b>higher</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> generated when fluorine replaced oxygen in combustion. The experiments failed because fluorine proved difficult to handle, and its combustion product (typically hydrogen fluoride) was extremely toxic and corrosive.|$|R
50|$|The <b>highest</b> <b>specific</b> <b>impulse</b> {{chemical}} rockets use liquid propellants (liquid-propellant rockets). They can {{consist of}} a single chemical (a monopropellant) or a mix of two chemicals, called bipropellants. Bipropellants can further {{be divided into two}} categories; hypergolic propellants, which ignite when the fuel and oxidizer make contact, and non-hypergolic propellants which require an ignition source.|$|R
