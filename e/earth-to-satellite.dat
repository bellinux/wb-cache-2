30|$|Outdoor OW links are a {{high-bandwidth}} and low-power-consumption alternative in {{satellite communications}} [4] and OW links {{have been successfully}} demonstrated in satellite-to-satellite, <b>earth-to-satellite</b> and earth-to-moving-vehicle links [188 – 199]. Satellite systems are the most challenging category of outdoor OW systems, because of the very long distances that the optical beams propagate through vacuum or the atmosphere. Optical links that operate in vacuum (inter-satellite and space communications) are at least {{tens of thousands of}} kms long. Even if the vacuum is considered to be ideal (lossless), the associated path losses that increase with the square of the link distance are enormous, and vary from approximately 150 dB in satellite-to-satellite communications to approximately 230 dB in Mars-to-Earth communications. <b>Earth-to-satellite</b> optical links involves shorter distances, up to approximately 36, 000 km for a geostationary orbit, but the total system losses are increased due to scattering and absorption in the atmosphere [150, 152]. Hence, a key consideration in satellite communications is the received optical power and several techniques have been proposed to mitigate the transmission associated losses. Optical amplification is an appealing candidate [200 – 203], especially in <b>earth-to-satellite</b> uplinks where low power consumption limitations do not apply. Another possible candidate in <b>earth-to-satellite</b> communications is the use of flying vehicles and high-altitude-platforms as beam relays [204 – 206]. When no amplification or intermediate relays are available, as in deep space communications [207], the losses may not be mitigated and more sophisticated receivers that operate at very low powers (photon-counting) are required [208].|$|E

30|$|A second {{important}} aspect of satellite systems is the selection of suitable modulation formats and coding schemes, depending on the application scope. Power efficiency is critical in satellite communications, since satellites recharge only by means of solar energy. Recently, a 5.6 -Gb/s inter-satellite link demonstrated the suitability of binary phase shift keying (BPSK) for satellite OW links [192]. Deep space communications, on the other hand, are plagued by extreme path losses and favor the deployment of modulation formats with high peak-to-average power ratios, which ensure that energy peaks are detected. Multilevel PPM systems {{have been shown to}} be suitable for deployment in deep space communications [150, 209]. Efficient error-correcting coding is also required in deep space communications due to the extremely low powers received, and concatenated convolutional codes have being shown to perform close to the theoretical capacity limit [209]. In <b>earth-to-satellite</b> systems, coherent phase modulation schemes provide high sensitivity and the use of BPSK has been previously reported on a similar 5.6 Gb/s 142 km OW link [210]. PPM has also been studied under the prism of providing sufficient peak power to penetrate through clouds [211, 212]. Error-correcting codes help to mitigate deep atmospheric fades, but there is a high possibility that the OW link will be lost due to adverse weather conditions altogether [213]. In such cases, temporal or spatial diversity is required to maintain a working <b>earth-to-satellite</b> optical link [214, 215].|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{presents a}} time-series generator which models rain fading in satellite-to- Earth or <b>Earth-to-satellite</b> links considering seasonal and diurnal variations. The model {{is based on}} a mix of a Markov chain like approach and Gaussian random variables.

The proposed model consists of a generic part and specific parameter sets. These parameter sets depend on the underlying scenario (frequency, climatic zone, elevation of Earth station antenna) and can be adjusted during run-time to account for seasonal and diurnal variations. The basic concept of the time-series generator has been published at [1, 2, 3]. In this document the specific focus is on the consideration of seasonal and diurnal variations...|$|E

The originality of this experiment resides in the link's frequencies (20 GHz downlink and 44 GHz uplink) and its low elevation angle (17 °). The first part of the article presents a statistical analysis of attenuation data providing the long-term statistics, frequency scaling ratios and fade durations. These results are compared to standard ITU models. The second part of the article is dedicated to the short-term forecasting of rain fade, useful for the implementation of Fade Mitigation Techniques (FMT). Firstly, the downlink attenuation is predicted based on a non-linear ARIMA-GARCH model. The prediction result is then separated into several physical components (gases, clouds and rain) that are scaled to the uplink frequency using specific frequency scaling factors.

40|$|The {{performance}} of <b>earth-to-satellite</b> link largely depends on various environmental factors like rain, fog, cloud, and atmospheric effects like ionospheric and tropospheric scintillation. In this paper, the tropospheric scintillation of Bangladesh, a subtropical country, is predicted based on measured climatic parameters, like relative humidity, temperature. In this prediction, ITU scintillation model are used. Four major cities, named Dhaka, Chittagong, Rajshahi and Sylhet, of Bangladesh are selected for prediction of scintillation. From the simulation result, Rajshahi {{is found to}} be the most badly affected region by the scintillation fade depth (SFD), which is followed by Chittagong and the SFD is minimum in Dhaka and Sylhet. The difference in SFDs among the considered cities does not vary heavily. It is also found that the SFD varies from 3 dB to 13 dB depending on the frequency in used. Moreover, higher scintillation is found in rainy season of Bangladesh. During this period, the scintillation becomes double of the average figure.

30|$|A final {{challenge}} in satellite communications is beam acquisition, pointing, and tracking. Longer links typically require more accurate and sophisticated acquisition, pointing and tracking systems {{to maintain an}} operational OW link, since the slightest error is magnified by the link distance. From a communication perspective, pointing and tracking are not only important for maintaining the optical link, but {{also contribute to the}} link power penalty since misalignment caused by pointing and tracking errors result in power fluctuations at the receiver [216 – 218]. Pointing and tracking errors are caused mainly by (a) satellite vibrations [218], (b) errors in the calculation of the point-ahead angle [4], and (c) beam wander effects [219]. Pointing and tracking errors may be reduced by using advanced automated control methods in the pointing and tracking element [4], while their impact may be dampened by allowing adaptive variations in the transmitted power [218] or a broader optical beam [220]. In <b>earth-to-satellite</b> communications pointing and tracking also suffer from fades in the atmosphere, and it is possible that re-acquisition of the beam is required after a fade, leading to extended capacity loss. Reference [221] discusses how inertial sensors can be utilized to counter-effect beam loss due to atmospheric fading.|$|E
40|$|Rain is {{the major}} source of {{attenuation}} for microwave propagation above 10 GHz. In tropical and equatorial regions where the rain intensity is higher, designing a terrestrial and <b>earth-to-satellite</b> microwave links is very critical and challenging at these frequencies. This paper presents the preliminary results of rain effects in a 23 GHz terrestrial point-to-point communication link 1. 3 km long. The experimental test bed had been set up at Skudai, Johor Bahru, Malaysia. In this area, a monsoon equatorial climate prevails and the rainfall rate can reach values well above 100 mm/h with significant monthly and diurnal variability. Hence, it is necessary to implement a mitigation technique for maintaining an adequate radio link performance for the action of very heavy rain. Since we now know that the ULPC (Up Link Power Control) cannot guarantee the desired performance, a solution based on frequency band diversity is proposed in this paper. Here, a secondary radio link operating in a frequency not affected by rain (C band for instance) is placed parallel with the main link. Under no rain or light rain conditions, the secondary link carries without priority radio signals. When there is an outage of the main link due to rain, the secondary link assumes the priority traffic. The outcome of the research shows a solution for higher operating frequencies during rainy events...|$|E
40|$|In the {{framework}} of the ITALSAT campaign various European institutions carried out propagation measurements at V band. In this frequency band, signal reception in a satellite-to- Earth or <b>Earth-to-satellite</b> path may suffer severely from signal attenuation due to meteorological effects such as rain, snow, hail, fog, clouds, etc., where rain provides the most significant contribution. In this paper, a joint analysis of the ITALSAT propagation measurement campaigns at 39. 6 GHz (precisely 39. 592 GHz) carried out at both Oberpfaffenhofen, close to Munich, Germany, and Spino d’Adda, close to Milan, Italy, is presented. For both stations long-term attenuation statistics are available and reveal that signal attenuation due to meteorological effects depends very much on the season and on the time of the day. Signal attenuation can be compensated by an appropriate fade margin. In this paper, we show that the required fade margin to guarantee a target link availability has to be chosen very carefully, since it depends very much on the time interval upon which availability is defined. We consider complete years, ITU-R recommendations, all single months of the year, worst months, and spring, summer, fall, and winter. Furthermore, we evaluate diurnal variations for four time intervals: 00 : 00 – 06 : 00, 06 : 00 – 12 : 00, 12 : 00 – 18 : 00, and 18 : 00 – 24 : 00...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows how}} {{nonlinear}} models originally {{developed in the}} finance field {{can be used to}} predict rain attenuation level and volatility in <b>Earth-to-Satellite</b> links operating at the Extremely High Frequencies band (EHF, 20 – 50 GHz). A common approach to solving this problem is to consider that the prediction error corresponds only to scintillations, whose variance is assumed to be constant. Nevertheless, this assumption {{does not seem to be}} realistic because of the heteroscedasticity of error time series: the variance of the prediction error is found to be time-varying and has to be modeled. Since rain attenuation time series behave similarly to certain stocks or foreign exchange rates, a switching ARIMA/GARCH model was implemented. The originality of this model is that not only the attenuation level, but also the error conditional distribution are predicted. It allows an accurate upper-bound of the future attenuation to be estimated in real time that minimizes the cost of Fade Mitigation Techniques (FMT) and therefore enables the communication system to reach a high percentage of availability. The performance of the switching ARIMA/GARCH model was estimated using a measurement database of the Olympus satellite 20 / 30 GHz beacons and this model is shown to outperform significantly other existing models. The model also includes frequency scaling from the downlink frequency to the uplink frequency. The attenuation effects (gases, clouds and rain) are first separated with a neural network and then scaled using specific scaling factors. As to the resulting uplink prediction error, the error contribution of the frequency scaling step is shown to be larger than that of the downlink prediction, indicating that further study should focus on improving the accuracy of the scaling factor...|$|E

The atmospheric gases and rain will both absorb and scatter the radio waves, and consequently degrade the performance of the link. Rain is a major source of attenuation for microwave propagation above 7 GHz. In tropical and equatorial regions, the rain intensity is higher and designing terrestrial and <b>earth-to-satellite</b> microwave links are very critical and challenging for high frequencies. This paper presents the summary of rain effects studies for lower operating frequency such as C band compare to higher operating frequency such as Ka band in tropical environment. The main objective to justified the literature findings on the effect of rain at lower and higher operating frequency in microwave link and solution to overcome it.

The main outcome of the research shows there is no effect of rain for 5. 8 GHz link but there is strong effects with rain on the 23 GHz link. It was observed 15 dB to 35 dB attenuation during measurement period.
