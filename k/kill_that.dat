5|$|On 11 May, Plagis {{attempted}} to down an Italian Reggiane Re.2001 by flying straight at it to ram it; taking erratic evasive manoeuvres, the Italian aircraft stalled and almost {{crashed into the}} sea. Thinking he had downed the enemy, Plagis claimed afterwards to have achieved an aerial victory without firing a shot, but the Italian flight reported no losses. Plagis's Spitfire was lightly hit during this engagement, and the Rhodesian had some luck returning safely; he landed with only three gallons (14 litres) of fuel left. On 16 May, Plagis and an English ace, Pilot Officer Peter Nash, destroyed a Bf 109 for a shared <b>kill</b> <b>that</b> became No. 249 Squadron's 100th victory over Malta.

500|$|Songbirds {{and their}} {{associated}} symbolism appear throughout the novel. Their family name Finch is also Lee's mother's maiden name. The titular mockingbird {{is a key}} motif of this theme, which first appears when Atticus, having given his children air-rifles for Christmas, allows their Uncle Jack {{to teach them to}} shoot. Atticus warns them that, although they can [...] "shoot all the bluejays they want", they must remember that [...] "it's a sin to kill a mockingbird". Confused, Scout approaches her neighbor Miss Maudie, who explains that mockingbirds never harm other living creatures. She points out that mockingbirds simply provide pleasure with their songs, saying, [...] "They don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us." [...] Writer Edwin Bruell summarized the symbolism when he wrote in 1964, [...] "'To kill a mockingbird' is to <b>kill</b> <b>that</b> which is innocent and harmless—like Tom Robinson." [...] Scholars have noted that Lee often returns to the mockingbird theme when trying to make a moral point.|$|E
500|$|On September 19, 1975, the Ramones {{recorded}} a demo at 914 Sound Studios, which {{was produced by}} Marty Thau. Featuring the songs [...] "Judy Is a Punk" [...] and [...] "I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend", the band used the demo to showcase their style to prospective labels. Producer Craig Leon, who had seen the Ramones perform {{in the summer of}} 1975, brought the demo to the attention of Sire Records' president Seymour Stein. After being persuaded by Craig Leon and his ex-wife Linda Stein, the Ramones auditioned at Sire and were offered a contract, although the label had previously signed only European progressive rock bands. Drummer Tommy Ramone recalled: [...] "Craig Leon is the one who got us signed, single handed. He brought down the vice president and all these people—he's the only hip one in the company. He risked his career to get us on the label." [...] The label offered to release [...] "You're Gonna <b>Kill</b> <b>That</b> Girl" [...] as a single, but the band declined, insisting on recording an entire album. Sire accepted their request and agreed to release a studio album instead.|$|E
500|$|Treviño Morales {{acted as}} a cartel 'gate-keeper,' and his people {{collected}} a piso (tariff) at all drug territories controlled by Los Zetas. He controlled the highly lucrative Nuevo Laredo plaza (turf), {{across the border from}} Laredo, Texas. He bribed and intimidated officials to help maintain control, and responded to any challenges to his authority or control with brutal violence. Treviño was feared and very few local journalists dared to write about him. He was alleged to favored a torture method known as the guiso (stew), in which people are stuffed into an oil barrel, doused with gasoline, and set on fire to burn alive. His violent behavior gained him [...] "the notoriety of a cult figure." [...] He reportedly survived gun battles unharmed, avoided making alliances with anyone, dismembered dozens of victims while they were still alive and dumped them, and [...] "seemed unafraid to die." [...] Organization members claimed that Treviño Morales enjoyed driving around the city in a car, pointing at people randomly and saying, [...] "kill this one and <b>kill</b> <b>that</b> one." [...] A former hitman who worked for him told the press in 2013 that Treviño Morales could not sleep at night if he did not kill someone. He also said that the drug lord would ask his victims how they wanted to be killed. Journalist Alfredo Corchado, head of The Dallas Morning News in Mexico, wrote in one of his books that Treviño Morales enjoyed eating out the hearts of his victims—even when they were still alive—because he believed that doing that would make him invincible among his enemies and authorities.|$|E

500|$|With the 2012 {{continuation}} of Dallas, {{there was talk}} of some Knots Landing characters returning to air. Rumors began surfacing that both Van Ark and Shackelford would reprise their roles as Valene and Gary. Ted Shackelford passed on the small role the producers offered him to reprise his role as Gary Ewing on the new series. [...] Van Ark refuted the claims, saying: [...] "Well, rumor has it… I’m having lunch with Ted tomorrow. They asked him to come down and be part of it. It was several months ago, and he’s deeply into filming The Young and the Restless, the daytime soap for CBS. But if they asked Gary, maybe they’ll ask [...]" [...] She would, however, love to be involved if the producers asked her, especially to torment fellow cast-member Larry Hagman. [...] "There is no doubt about it. This man I loved so much, Larry Hagman… I was just at his birthday party several months ago… I would <b>kill,</b> <b>that</b> if Val came back, if it was trouble for J.R.. Because they were always at odds." [...] However, Gary and Valene's daughter, Lucy Ewing, along with Ray Krebbs have made appearances in the new series. Although both Shackleford and Van Ark appeared in the 1991 series finale of Dallas playing [...] "alternative" [...] versions of Gary and Valene (the episode depicted a fantasy world in which J.R. had never been born), there have been no real crossovers of story or characters from Knots Landing to Dallas or vice versa since the 1985-86 season of each show (which, on Dallas, {{turned out to be a}} dream had by Pamela Ewing).|$|E
500|$|The album's only cover song, [...] "California Sun", was {{originally}} written by Henry Glover and Morris Levy, and performed by The Rivieras. While the lyrics and musical structure {{remain the same}} throughout the piece, Joey's pronunciation upon words significantly lessened the similarity to the original song. The sound output tone also differs from the original, with more distortion {{as well as a}} faster tempo. Author Steve Waksman relates: [...] "From the opening bars, 'California Sun' becomes subject to the Ramones' distinctive brand of musical minimalism paired with sonic excess. The chords go by in a blur of distortion; the drums and bass kick at seemingly twice the speed of the Rivieras." [...] The twelfth track [...] "Commando" [...] has a theme which deals with war movies and contains multiple military references. Author Avram Mednick said the song was a successor to [...] "Blitzkrieg Bop", released on the band's debut album. He also noted that it has a [...] "bouncy melody and an infectious call-and-response chorus." [...] "You're Gonna <b>Kill</b> <b>that</b> Girl", which was written very early in the band's career, was also rooted in doo-wop genre. Mednick commented that it appealed highly to those tuning into the Ramones in the UK, and also said it has a [...] "lovely misogynistic tune." [...] The final guitar chord on the track is played by drummer Tommy since Johnny rarely played acoustic. The album's final track, [...] "You Should Never Have Opened That Door", was written by Dee Dee and Johnny, and circles themes of horror films and hints that people in these movies tend to be naïve and unintelligent.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} negative {{reviews from}} critics. A writer from Entertainment Weekly gave [...] "Teso Dos Bichos" [...] a C, and sardonically wrote, [...] "No es bueno!"

There {{could be some}} subtext in, um, yeah, I got nothing. The dead rats in the toilet were freaky, right? And they did <b>kill</b> <b>that</b> dog off, so that's hardcore. Really, though, I'm just too disappointed to say much else. This is paint-by-numbers at its most tedious, and while it's nice to have evident proof of how far the show has come since it started, that doesn't {{make it any easier}} to sit through." [...] Critical Myth's John Keegan gave the episode a scathing review, only awarding it 1/10. He criticized the seriousness of the plot and wrote, [...] "Overall, this has {{to be one of the}} worst episodes of the series. In nearly every possible way, the episode fails to live up to the usual expectations. Perhaps aware of how silly the whole thing sounds, the cast and crew seem weary of it all from beginning to end. Even some of the bad ideas in the later seasons don’t fall to this level of inadequacy." [...] Cyriaque Lamar from i09 called the Jaguar Spirit one of [...] "The 10 Most Ridiculous X-Files Monsters" [...] and wrote, [...] "In this fairly ridiculous Season 3 episode, an Ecuadorian artifact possessed by a Jaguar Spirit (or something) causes tabbies to go bonkers and murder people. This scene of Scully fighting a cat deserves the GIF treatment. Make it happen, folks!" [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one stars out of five, calling the premise [...] "achingly unambitious". The two roundly criticized the plot, calling it a [...] "retread of a cursed mummy movie without a mummy", as well as the performances of Trevino, Duchovny, and Anderson. Despite the overall negativity, Shearman and Pearson noted that the [...] "much derided" [...] cat sequence was not [...] "that badly handled." ...|$|E
