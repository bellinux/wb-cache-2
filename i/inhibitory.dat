5|$|There {{are many}} ways in which {{epilepsy}} occurs. Examples of pathological physiology include: unusual excitatory connections within the neuronal network of the brain; abnormal neuron structure leading to altered current flow; decreased <b>inhibitory</b> neurotransmitter synthesis; ineffective receptors for <b>inhibitory</b> neurotransmitters; insufficient breakdown of excitatory neurotransmitters leading to excess; immature synapse development; and impaired function of ionic channels.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{stressed}} serpin fold is high-energy, mutations {{can cause}} them to incorrectly change into their lower-energy conformations (e.g. relaxed or latent) before they have correctly performed their <b>inhibitory</b> role.|$|E
5|$|The {{arcuate nucleus}} {{contains}} two distinct groups of neurons. The first group coexpresses neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and has stimulatory inputs to the LH and <b>inhibitory</b> inputs to the VMH. The second group coexpresses pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) and has stimulatory inputs to the VMH and <b>inhibitory</b> inputs to the LH. Consequently, NPY/AgRP neurons stimulate feeding and inhibit satiety, while POMC/CART neurons stimulate satiety and inhibit feeding. Both groups of arcuate nucleus neurons are regulated {{in part by}} leptin. Leptin inhibits the NPY/AgRP group while stimulating the POMC/CART group. Thus a deficiency in leptin signaling, either via leptin deficiency or leptin resistance, leads to overfeeding and may account for some genetic and acquired forms of obesity.|$|E
5|$|Three azo- and azoxyformamides {{compounds}} {{have been}} isolated and identified from the puffball and tested {{for their ability}} to inhibit the growth of plants: 4-methoxybenzene-1-ONN-azoxyformamide, 4-methoxybenzene-1-azoformamide, and 4-hydroxybenzene-1-azoformamide. Only the first compound was significantly <b>inhibitory,</b> suggesting that the presence of the azoxy moiety is required for growth inhibition.|$|E
5|$|Various Cyathus {{species have}} {{antifungal}} activity against human pathogens such as Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. Extracts of C.striatus have <b>inhibitory</b> effects on NF-κB, a transcription factor responsible for regulating {{the expression of}} several genes involved in the immune system, inflammation, and cell death.|$|E
5|$|Basket {{cells in}} CA3 receive {{excitatory}} {{input from the}} pyramidal cells and then give an <b>inhibitory</b> feedback to the pyramidal cells. This recurrent inhibition is a simple feedback circuit that can dampen excitatory responses in the hippocampus. The pyramidal cells gives a recurrent excitation which is an important mechanism found in some memory processing microcircuits.|$|E
5|$|Protease <b>inhibitory</b> {{activity}} in blood plasma was first {{reported in the}} late 1800s, {{but it was not}} until the 1950s that the serpins antithrombin and alpha 1-antitrypsin were isolated. Initial research focused on their role in human disease: alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency is one of the most common genetic disorders, causing emphysema, and antithrombin deficiency results in thrombosis.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain is}} {{composed}} {{of a network of}} neurons that transmit signals by propagating nerve impulses. The propagation of this impulse from one neuron to another is typically controlled by neurotransmitters, though there are also electrical pathways between some neurons. Neurotransmitters can inhibit impulse firing (primarily done by γ-aminobutyric acid, or GABA) or they can excite the neuron into firing (primarily done by glutamate). A neuron that releases <b>inhibitory</b> neurotransmitters from its terminals is called an <b>inhibitory</b> neuron, while one that releases excitatory neurotransmitters is an excitatory neuron. When the normal balance between inhibition and excitation is significantly disrupted in {{all or part of the}} brain, a seizure can occur. The GABA system is an important target for anticonvulsant drugs, since seizures may be discouraged by increasing GABA synthesis, decreasing its breakdown, or enhancing its effect on neurons.|$|E
25|$|Stimulative hormone {{receptor}} (Rs) is a receptor that can bind with stimulative signal molecules, while <b>inhibitory</b> {{hormone receptor}} (Ri) is a receptor that can bind with <b>inhibitory</b> signal molecules.|$|E
25|$|The cAMP signal {{transduction}} contains 5 main characters: stimulative hormone receptor (Rs) or <b>inhibitory</b> hormone receptor (Ri); stimulative regulative G-protein (Gs) or <b>inhibitory</b> regulative G-protein (Gi); adenylyl cyclase; protein kinase A (PKA); and cAMP phosphodiesterase.|$|E
25|$|ADP {{can also}} bind to the second, <b>inhibitory,</b> NADH-site yet causes activation.|$|E
25|$|The <b>inhibitory</b> {{effect of}} {{omeprazole}} occurs within 1 hour after oral administration. The maximum effect occurs within 2 hours. The duration of inhibition {{is up to}} 72 hours. When omeprazole is stopped, baseline stomach acid secretory activity returns after 3 to 5 days. The <b>inhibitory</b> effect of omeprazole on acid secretion will plateau after 4 days of repeated daily dosing.|$|E
25|$|Stimulative regulative G-protein is a G-protein {{linked to}} stimulative hormone {{receptor}} (Rs), and its α subunit upon activation could stimulate {{the activity of}} an enzyme or other intracellular metabolism. On the contrary, <b>inhibitory</b> regulative G-protein is linked to an <b>inhibitory</b> hormone receptor, and its α subunit upon activation could inhibit the activity of an enzyme or other intracellular metabolism.|$|E
25|$|Ghrelin has <b>inhibitory</b> {{effects on}} gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion. It may cause {{decreased}} fertility.|$|E
25|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} {{have also}} been used against <b>inhibitory</b> factors such as NI-35 and NOGO.|$|E
25|$|CD8+ T cell {{exhaustion}} {{occurs in}} some tumours, {{and can be}} partly reversed by blocking the <b>inhibitory</b> receptors (eg PD1).|$|E
25|$|The {{tetanus toxin}} {{initially}} binds to peripheral nerve terminals. It is transported within the axon and across synaptic junctions {{until it reaches}} the central nervous system. There it becomes rapidly fixed to gangliosides at the presynaptic <b>inhibitory</b> motor nerve endings, and is taken up into the axon by endocytosis. The effect of the toxin is to block the release of <b>inhibitory</b> neurotransmitters glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) across the synaptic cleft, which is required to check the nervous impulse. If nervous impulses cannot be checked by normal <b>inhibitory</b> mechanisms, the generalized muscular spasms characteristic of tetanus are produced. The toxin appears to act by selective cleavage of a protein component of synaptic vesicles, synaptobrevinII, and this prevents the release of neurotransmitters by the cells.|$|E
25|$|Also, Rubisco side {{activities}} {{can lead to}} useless or <b>inhibitory</b> by-products; one such product is xylulose-1,5-bisphosphate, which inhibits Rubisco activity.|$|E

25|$|Dendritic spines usually receive {{excitatory}} input from axons although sometimes both <b>inhibitory</b> and excitatory connections are made onto the same spine head.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{pathways}} involving basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry, both {{of which}} originate in the neostriatum. The direct pathway projects to the internal globus pallidus (GPi) and to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). These projections are <b>inhibitory</b> and {{have been found to}} utilize both GABA and substance P. The indirect pathway, which projects to the globus pallidus external (GPe), is also <b>inhibitory</b> and uses GABA and enkephalin. The GPe projects to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), which then projects back to the GPi and GPe via excitatory, glutaminergic pathways. Excitation of the direct pathway leads to disinhibition of the GABAergic neurons of the GPi/SNr, ultimately resulting in activation of thalamic neurons and excitation of cortical neurons. In contrast, activation of the indirect pathway stimulates the <b>inhibitory</b> striatal GABA/enkephalin projection, resulting in suppression of GABAerigc neuronal activity. This, in turn, causes disinhibition of the STN excitatory outputs, thus triggering the GPi/SNr <b>inhibitory</b> projections to the thalamus and decreased activation of cortical neurons. While deregulation of either of these pathways can disturb motor output, hyperkinesia is thought to result from overactivity of the direct pathway and decreased activity from the indirect pathway.|$|E
25|$|<b>Inhibitory</b> control, often {{conceptualized}} {{as an executive}} function, {{is the ability to}} inhibit or hold back a prepotent response. It is theorized that impulsive behavior reflects a deficit in this ability to inhibit a response; impulsive people may find it more difficult to inhibit action whereas non-impulsive people may find it easier to do so. There is evidence that, in normal adults, commonly used behavioral measures of <b>inhibitory</b> control correlate with standard self-report measures of impulsivity.|$|E

25|$|The {{distinction}} between excitatory and <b>inhibitory</b> neurotransmitters is not absolute, however. Rather, {{it depends on}} the class of chemical receptors present on the postsynaptic neuron. In principle, a single neuron, releasing a single neurotransmitter, can have excitatory effects on some targets, <b>inhibitory</b> effects on others, and modulatory effects on others still. For example, photoreceptor cells in the retina constantly release the neurotransmitter glutamate in the absence of light. So-called OFF bipolar cells are, like most neurons, excited by the released glutamate. However, neighboring target neurons called ON bipolar cells are instead inhibited by glutamate, because they lack the typical ionotropic glutamate receptors and instead express a class of <b>inhibitory</b> metabotropic glutamate receptors. When light is present, the photoreceptors cease releasing glutamate, which relieves the ON bipolar cells from inhibition, activating them; this simultaneously removes the excitation from the OFF bipolar cells, silencing them.|$|E
25|$|CD200 (OX-2) {{is a type}} 1 {{membrane}} glycoprotein, which delivers an <b>inhibitory</b> {{signal to}} immune cells including T cells, natural killer cells and macrophages.|$|E
25|$|Slower {{degeneration}} of {{the distal}} segment {{than that which}} occurs in the peripheral nervous system also contributes to the <b>inhibitory</b> environment because <b>inhibitory</b> myelin and axonal debris are not cleared away as quickly. All these factors contribute {{to the formation of}} what is known as a glial scar, which axons cannot grow across. The proximal segment attempts to regenerate after injury, but its growth is hindered by the environment. It {{is important to note that}} central nervous system axons have been proven to regrow in permissive environments; therefore, the primary problem to central nervous system axonal regeneration is crossing or eliminating the <b>inhibitory</b> lesion site. Another problem is that the morphology and functional properties of central nervous system neurons are highly complex, for this reason a neuron cannot be functionally replaced by one of another type (Llinás' law).|$|E
25|$|However, TIGAR {{may also}} have an <b>inhibitory</b> effect on cancer {{development}} by preventing cellular proliferation through its role in p53 -mediated cell cycle arrest.|$|E

25|$|Gastric <b>inhibitory</b> peptide (GIP) – {{is in the}} {{duodenum}} {{and decreases}} the stomach churning in turn slowing the emptying in the stomach. Another function is to induce insulin secretion.|$|E
25|$|One {{example is}} again neurons of the {{sympathetic}} nervous system, which release noradrenaline, which, in addition, generates an <b>inhibitory</b> effect on presynaptic terminals of neurons of the parasympathetic nervous system.|$|E
25|$|Receptors on the {{opposite}} side of the synaptic gap bind neurotransmitter molecules. Receptors can respond in either of two general ways. First, the receptors may directly open ligand-gated ion channels in the postsynaptic cell membrane, causing ions to enter or exit the cell and changing the local transmembrane potential. The resulting change in voltage is called a postsynaptic potential. In general, the result is excitatory in the case of depolarizing currents, and <b>inhibitory</b> in the case of hyperpolarizing currents. Whether a synapse is excitatory or <b>inhibitory</b> depends on what type(s) of ion channel conduct the postsynaptic current(s), which in turn is a function of the type of receptors and neurotransmitter employed at the synapse. The second way a receptor can affect membrane potential is by modulating the production of chemical messengers inside the postsynaptic neuron. These second messengers can then amplify the <b>inhibitory</b> or excitatory response to neurotransmitters.|$|E
