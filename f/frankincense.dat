5|$|Resin is {{gathered}} by tapping trees including silver-fir and Aleppo pine; the best resin {{is from the}} terebinth. On Mount Ida in Crete the people gather pitch from Corsican pine and Aleppo pine. Gums such as <b>frankincense,</b> myrrh and balsam of Mecca are gathered either by cutting the plant or naturally. <b>Frankincense</b> and myrrh are gathered into the closely guarded temple of the Sabaeans. Cassia and cinnamon also come from the Arabian peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The Incense Route {{served as}} a channel for trading of Indian, Arabian and East Asian goods. The incense trade flourished from South Arabia to the Mediterranean between roughly the 3rd century BCE to the 2nd century CE. This trade was crucial to the economy of Yemen and the <b>frankincense</b> and myrrh trees were seen {{as a source of}} wealth by the its rulers.|$|E
5|$|Gedi's {{participation}} in maritime trade {{can be seen}} in the increasing frequency of imports found at Gedi over the course of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Conditions along the Atlantic coast prevented European nations from opening sea lanes until the early-sixteenth century, limiting maritime trade to states with easy access to the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. Many artifacts found at Gedi including much of the ceramics, all the beads, and the two Chinese coins resulted from either direct or indirect trade with the Near East, Arabia, China, India, and Indochina. Swahili coastal settlements exported gold, ivory, slaves, ebony, mangrove poles, copper, copal gum, <b>frankincense,</b> myrrh, and crystal rock.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Greece itself, {{medicinal}} plants are produced in Italy in Tyrrhenia, as Aeschylus records, and Latium; and in Egypt, which as Homer mentions {{is the source}} of the drug nepenthes that makes men forget sorrow and passion. The best hemlock comes from Susa, while dittany, useful in childbirth, comes only from Crete. Wolfsbane comes from Crete and Zakynthos; it can be made into a poison that causes death a year or more after taking it, and there is no antidote. Hemlock is a poison which brings a painless death; pepper and <b>frankincense</b> are antidotes for it. Strykhnos causes madness, but oleander root in wine makes people gentle and cheerful. Birthwort has many uses including for bruises on the head, snakebite, and prolapse of the uterus.|$|E
5|$|The Fraternity's rituals {{at their}} Bayswater temple {{were carried out}} under a dim light, with Fortune {{claiming}} that bright light disperses etheric forces. An altar {{was placed in the}} centre of a room, with the colours of the altar-cloth and the symbols on the altar varying according to the ceremony being performed. A light was placed on the altar while incense, usually <b>frankincense,</b> was burned. The senior officers sat in a row along the eastern end of the room, while officers—who were believed to be channels for cosmic forces—were positioned at various positions on the floor. The lodge was opened by walking around the room in a circle chanting, with the intent of building a psychic force up as a wall. Next, the cosmic entities would be invoked, with the members believing that these entities would manifest in astral form and interact with the chosen officers.|$|E
5|$|The main trade route {{leading into}} Han China passed first through Kashgar, yet Hellenized Bactria further west {{was the central}} node of {{international}} trade. By the 1st century AD, Bactria and much of Central Asia and North India were controlled by the Kushan Empire. Silk was the main export item from China to India. Indian merchants brought various goods to China, including tortoise shell, gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, tin, fine cloth, woolen textiles, perfume and incense, crystal sugar, pepper, ginger, salt, coral, pearls, glass items, and Roman wares. Indian merchants brought Roman styrax and <b>frankincense</b> to China, while the Chinese knew bdellium as a fragrant item from Persia, although it was native to West India. The tall Ferghana horses imported from Fergana were highly prized in Han China. The newly introduced exotic Central Asian grapes (i.e. vitis vinifera) were used to make grape wine, although the Chinese had rice wine before this. Glass luxury items from ancient Mesopotamia {{have been found in}} Chinese tombs and dated to the late Spring and Autumn period (771–476 BC). Roman glasswares have been found in Chinese tombs dating to the early 1st century BC, with the earliest specimen found at the southern Chinese seaport of Guangzhou. Silverwares from Roman- and Arsacid territories have also been found at Han tomb sites.|$|E

25|$|Hatshepsut's {{delegation}} {{returned from}} Punt bearing 31 live myrrh trees, {{the roots of}} which were carefully kept in baskets {{for the duration of}} the voyage. This was the first recorded attempt to transplant foreign trees. It is reported that Hatshepsut had these trees planted in the courts of her mortuary temple complex. Egyptians also returned with a number of other gifts from Punt, among which was <b>frankincense.</b> Hatshepsut would grind the charred <b>frankincense</b> into kohl eyeliner.

Their first father sinned, and their intercessors transgressed, and so God abandoned the sanctuary and the Israelites to condemnation.|$|E
25|$|With the {{advantage}} of being located near the Arabian Peninsula, Somali traders have increasingly begun to challenge Australia's traditional dominance over the Gulf Arab livestock and meat market, offering quality animals at very low prices. In response, Gulf Arab states have started to make strategic investments in the country, with Saudi Arabia building livestock export infrastructure and the United Arab Emirates purchasing large farmlands. Somalia is also a major world supplier of <b>frankincense</b> and myrrh.|$|E
25|$|Egypt's {{expanding}} {{interests in}} trade goods such as ebony, incense such as myrrh and <b>frankincense,</b> gold, copper and other useful metals compelled the ancient Egyptians {{to navigate the}} open seas. Evidence from the pyramid of Sahure, second king of the dynasty, shows that a regular trade existed with the Syrian coast to procure cedar wood. Pharaohs also launched expeditions to the famed Land of Punt, possibly the Horn of Africa, for ebony, ivory and aromatic resins.|$|E

25|$|Northern Somalia was an {{important}} link in the Horn, connecting the region's commerce {{with the rest of}} the ancient world. Somali sailors and merchants were the main suppliers of <b>frankincense,</b> myrrh and spices, all of which were valuable luxuries to the Ancient Egyptians, Phoenicians, Mycenaeans, Babylonians and Romans. The Romans consequently began to refer to the region as Regio Aromatica. In the classical era, several flourishing Somali city-states such as Opone, Mosylon and Malao also competed with the Sabaeans, Parthians and Axumites for the rich Indo-Greco-Roman trade.|$|E

25|$|According to {{official}} reports from 1924 {{commissioned by the}} Regio Governo della Somalia Italiana, the Majeerteen Sultanate maintained robust commercial activities before the Italian occupation of the following year. The Sultanate reportedly exported 1,056,400 Indian Rupees (IR) worth of commodities, 60% of which came {{from the sale of}} <b>frankincense</b> and other gums. Fish and other sea products sold for a total value of 250,000 IR, roughly equivalent to 20% of the Sultanate's aggregate exports. The remaining export proceeds came from livestock, with the export list of 1924 consisting of 16 items.|$|E
25|$|Hatshepsut {{established}} the trade networks {{that had been}} disrupted during the Hyksos occupation of Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period, thereby building {{the wealth of the}} eighteenth dynasty. She oversaw the preparations and funding for a mission to the Land of Punt. This trading expedition to Punt was roughly during Hatshepsut's ninth year of reign. It set out in her name with five ships, each measuring 70feet (21 m) long bearing several sails and accommodating 210 men that included sailors and 30 rowers. Many trade goods were bought in Punt, notably <b>frankincense</b> and myrrh.|$|E
25|$|Historically, the British used {{indirect}} rule {{to their}} advantage to control and exploit territories. Following the British treaty with the Warsangali in 1886, the British Somaliland protectorate was formed. Much of the territory's economy {{at the time was}} centered on the trade relationship it had with Aden, Yemen, which was chiefly based on the export of livestock, <b>frankincense,</b> and myrrh in return for food, fabric, and other materials. The protectorate was subsequently administered from Aden until 1898, just before the rise to prominence of Sayyid Muhammad Abdullah Hassan.|$|E
25|$|In ancient times, the Kingdom of Punt, {{which is}} {{believed}} by several Egyptologists {{to have been}} situated {{in the area of}} modern-day Somalia, had a steady trade link with the Ancient Egyptians and exported precious natural resources such as myrrh, <b>frankincense</b> and gum. This trade network continued all the way into the classical era. The city states of Mossylon, Malao, Mundus and Tabae in Somalia engaged in a lucrative trade network connecting Somali merchants with Phoenicia, Ptolemic Egypt, Greece, Parthian Persia, Saba, Nabataea and the Roman Empire. Somali sailors used the ancient Somali maritime vessel known as the beden to transport their cargo.|$|E
25|$|Ancient Egyptian records also {{document}} the extensive and lucrative mining operations and trade across the Red Sea with Egypt starting {{as early as}} the Fourth dynasty of Egypt. Eilat is mentioned in antiquity as a major trading partner with Elim, Thebes' Red Sea Port, {{as early as the}} Twelfth dynasty of Egypt. Trade between Elim and Eilat furnished <b>frankincense</b> and myrrh, brought up from Ethiopia and Punt; bitumen and natron, from the Dead Sea; finely woven linen, from Byblos; and copper amulets, from Timna; all mentioned in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. In antiquity Eilat bordered the states of Edom, Midian and the tribal territory of the Rephidim, the indigenous inhabitants of the Sinai Peninsula.|$|E
25|$|The {{declared}} {{value of the}} bulk of goods from the carrack brought back by Consent and Salomon was £31,000 and the cargo of Virgin {{and two of the}} fluitships were assessed at £15,000. Pereguine, Welcome their prize and the other fluitship carried at least as much totaling over £51,000. As well as Brazil wood the carracks cargo consisted of pepper, cloves, indigo, cinnamon, mace, Benzoin resin, <b>frankincense,</b> gum-lac, aloes, calicoes, silks and rutile quartz blonde stones. In all the total would have represented £6,100 for the Lord Admiral and £3,050 for the Queen. Also of importance were new Portuguese rutters captured at Recife; Lancaster would use them to great effect for the first ever English East India company expedition in 1601.|$|E
25|$|The volume {{contains}} five {{poems and}} six short stories, {{all on the}} theme of Christianity. Some of the poems can be taken as comments or epilogues on the short stories (e.g. Gold, <b>Frankincense</b> and Myrrh refers to the gifts in the stable which The Naughty Donkey in the preceding story attempts to eat). Although relatively unknown, this work, when referred to at all, is often stated as being for children; however the stories it contains are firmly aimed at an adult audience and with adult themes, especially for 1965. For instance, in the story The Water Bus, Mrs Hargreaves's cleaner tries to offload her woes to her employer, the main one of which is that her daughter is dying in hospital after an illegal abortion went wrong.|$|E
25|$|Cansaulim in South Goa is {{similarly}} {{famous for its}} Three Kings festival, which draws tourists from around the state and India. Three boys are selected from the three neighbouring villages of Quelim, Cansaulim and Arrosim to present the gifts of gold, <b>frankincense</b> and myrrh in a procession. Only a native of these villages may serve as king; outsiders are barred from the role. Throughout the year, excitement runs high in the villages to see who will be chosen. The boys selected are meticulously groomed, and must grow their hair long {{in time for the}} festival. The procession involves the three kings wearing jeweled red velvet robes and crowns, riding white horses decked with flowers and fine cloth, and they are shaded by colourful parasols, with a retinue of hundreds.|$|E

This tradition of seaborne trade was maintained in the early modern period by later Somali states such as the Gobroon Dynasty.|$|E
25|$|The {{components}} {{are still being}} studied and are not determined with absolute certainty. Stacte is variously described as being the extract of the transparent portion of the myrrh resin which exudes spontaneously from the tree, or a balsam from a tree such as opobalsamum or a styrax. Onycha, which in Greek means “nail,” is variously described as being the operculum from a shell found in the Red Sea (which are said to resemble a fingernail), the exudation from the rock rose bush called labdanum (both petals and markings which are said to resemble a fingernail), Styrax benzoin, bdellium, or even cloves.
