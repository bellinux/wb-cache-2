50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1906, he was betrayed, when he {{performed}} an act of revenge {{in the village of}} <b>Krapa,</b> and his band was attacked by the Serboman band of Gligor Sokolovic.

50|$|In the {{location}} of the present-day town, there was a bridge that connected the towns of Prilep and Kičevo, which gave the name of the town. According to a tomb inscription found in the village of <b>Krapa,</b> it was determined that the area was populated by the Romans. Later, with the arrival of Slavs to the Balkan Peninsula, the Slavic tribe Berziti (Brsjaci) settled here.|$|E
50|$|Tasa Konević Apostolović (Таса Коневић Апостоловић; d. 1916) was an Orthodox {{priest and}} Macedonian Serb Chetnik from <b>Krapa</b> in Poreče. He {{was the son}} of a local Serb chief, Kone Apostolović, who was the leader of the Prilep Serbs at the end of the 19th century, and one of the richest in the village. Priest Tasa was the {{protector}} of Serbdom in Poreče and led the local guerrilla organization. He participated in the Ilinden Uprising (July-August 1903), orchestrated by the Bulgarian-organized Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), with a Serb band. After the Kokošinje slaughters (July-October 1904) and IMRO attacks on Macedonian Serbs, he organized the village self-defense units and joined Gligor Sokolović and his neighbour Trenko Rujanović, of the Serbian Chetnik Organization. Tasa defended and administrated the village throughout the Macedonian Struggle. An important event was the attack on <b>Krapa</b> by combined bands of the IMRO, which ended in a fight on Kurt's Stone won by the Serbian bands. Tasa was murdered in 1916, in the Derviš fields massacre when the occupying Bulgarian Army executed 104 Serb leaders from Poreče.|$|E

50|$|Mamozai is a Pashtun {{tribe of}} Orakzai Agency along the Afghanistan and Pakistan border. Like many Afghans or Pashtuns, Orakzai are split along {{both sides of}} the border. It {{consists}} of a large area including places such as Sama Bazaar, Kach Gari, Jaba (land of beauty and water fountains), Matrak, Gutta Khel, Kalaya, Khawano, <b>Krapa</b> and Darrah. The Mamuzai have five subtribes (tapas: the Akhunzadagan, the Ado Khel, Abdur Rahim Khel, Sipoyee, and Mir Kalam Khel). A number of Mamozai also live in Kohat, Peshawar, and other parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa; those living in urban areas tend to be more educated but otherwise share most of the cultural norms of the Mamozai. This tribe {{is one of the most}} gallant tribes of fata.|$|E
5000|$|Nedić {{was born}} in 1875, {{in the village of}} Strugovo near Bitola, in the Ottoman Empire (now R. Macedonia). He {{received}} his nickname Ćela (slang for [...] "head"), due to his Typhoid fever that left marks on his head. He joined the Bulgarian-organized Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) as a fighter in the bands of Georgi Sugarev and Gligor Sokolović. In 1902 he befriended Milorad Gođevac, the founder of the Serbian Chetnik Organization. He participated in the Ilinden Uprising. He joined the Serbian Chetniks in 1903, and in 1905 he and Jovan Babunski cross the Vardar for the Veles region. He participated in the battles of Oreška Livada and Kurt's Stone near <b>Krapa</b> (1905). He was an active fighter in the Balkan Wars and the First World War (1912-18), then after the Serbian liberation he became a municipality president in his home village, a post he held until his murder. He was murdered in 1923 by a Bulgarian nationalist agent.|$|E
5000|$|Dolgač {{stayed with}} the IMRO until 1904, {{disappointed}} with the Bulgarian attacks within the organization against Serb villages around Prilep. Together with Gligor Sokolović he joined the Serbian Chetnik Organization and became a commander (vojvoda) of a band active in Prilep. He killed his own brother Zmejko when he refused to join the Serbian Organization. He participated in the battles of Mukos (1905), <b>Krapa</b> (1906), which were {{in the region of}} the Chief Staff of Western Povardarje. He participated in the First Balkan War where he distinguished himself in the battles of Kumanovo and the fighting on Mukos. In the work of Grigorije Božović, [...] "Striko Dolgač" [...] (Uncle Dolgač) was displayed as being a type of old Christian hajduk, who refused to believe that a Serb Muslim in his band could be a Serb and not a Turk; he became the embodiment of the Balkan understanding of religion as a divider of nations. Because of an attack on a Turkish wedding in 1913, he was arrested by the Serbian authorities, but was eventually freed in order to fight in the Second Balkan War. In 1915, at an old age, he was appointed the village chief. He was murdered the same year by the IMRO.|$|E
40|$|Two {{new species}} of endemic and relict cave-dwellers of genus Neobisium Chamberlin, have been {{described}} from Turkey and Macedonia (FYROM), respectively. From its phenetically close congener, N. granulatum Beier, N. yozgati n. sp. (from Yozgat, Turkey) is distinguished in many important respects. In addition, N. anaisae n. sp. (from a cave in <b>Krapa,</b> FYROM) differs from its closest forms (N. korabense Ćurčić, N. ohridanum Hadži, and N. vladimirpantici Ćurčić) by many morphological characters and form of different body parts. Both species are illustrated, diagnosed, and thoroughly described. They both represent endemic and relict forms...|$|E

40|$|The Mirdita-Subpelagonian ophiolites {{are part}} of a {{continuous}} ophiolitic belt extending from Dinarides to Albanides and Hellenides, and share geological, litho-stratigraphical, petrological, and metallogenic features. In the Albanide sector, the Mirdita ophiolites can be subdivided into two distinct belts: (1) an Eastern Belt composed of supra-subduction zone (SSZ) ophiolites with island arc tholeiitic (IAT) and boninitic affinities; and (2) a Western Belt mainly composed of mid-ocean ridge (MORB) ophiolites, locally associated with MORB/IAT intermediate basalts and boninitic dykes. In the Hellenide sector, the Subpelagonian ophiolites cannot be distinguished into two separate ophiolitic belts. In the Pindos Complex, the intrusives and the lowermost part of the volcanic sequence show MORB affinity, whereas its upper part displays MORB/IAT intermediate and boninitic characteristics. On the other hand, the Vourinos Complex is totally composed of SSZ ophiolites including a lower sequence (<b>Krapa)</b> with IAT affinity and an upper sequence (Asprokambo) with boninitic affinity. Petrological features of the different magmatic volcano-plutonic sequences suggest that they essentially originated by fractional crystallization from distinct parental magmas, which, in turn, were generated by partial melting of mantle sources variably depleted by previous melt extraction events. MORBs may have derived from partial melting of a relatively undepleted lherzolitic source, while MORB/IAT intermediate basalts generated by lower melting degrees of SSZ mantle source previously depleted by MORB extraction. Generation of IATs and boninites could, in turn, be accounted for by higher degree partial melting of progressively depleted mantle sources. Both IAT and boninitic sources were variably enriched in LFSE and LREE by subduction-derived fluids. The coexistence of these geochemically different magma types, in a restricted space/time interval, may be explained by various tectono-magmatic models. The favoured model for the genesis of the Mirdita-Subpelagonian ophiolites implies a formation of a IAT nascent arc by west-dipping intraoceanic subduction characterized by slab roll-back and intense asthenospheric mantle diapirism in the forearc region. This produced shallow partial melting of the sub-arc mantle with generation of boninitic magmas, and interarc tensional events with production of MORB/IAT intermediate basalts up to pure MORBs...|$|E
