Instead of taking the part in I Shot Andy Warhol, Sevigny starred in and worked as a fashion designer on Gummo (1997), directed and written by Harmony Korine, who was romantically involved with Sevigny during filming. Gummo was as controversial as Sevigny's debut; set in Xenia, Ohio, the film depicts an array of nihilistic characters in a poverty-stricken small-town America, and presents issues such as <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> as well as anti-social alienated youth in Midwestern America. In retrospection to the confronting nature of the film, Sevigny cited it as one of her favorite projects: [...] "Young people love that movie. It's been stolen from every Blockbuster in America.

This exceptional academic achievement {{raises the question of}} what and how resilience assets enable some students to perform the same task better than others who have the same background. How Malaysian adolescent students develop academic resilience against risk factors is unclear. The review argues that this issue should be brought to light, so that an academic resilience model is developed for non-resilient students. Such a model would allow teachers to establish a caregiving relationship with their non-resilient students, help them counteract risk factors, and, thus, make a positive difference in their lives...|$|E

40|$|Background Globally, {{the second}} {{leading cause of}} death among {{adolescents}} is suicide and in middle-income countries adolescents’ suicidal ideation is a neglected public health area. The present study was conducted to determine the prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideation among 15 – 17 -year-old high school students in Iran. Methods Self-administered, Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS) questionnaires were distributed to a representative sample (N = 1517) of high-school students aged 15 – 17 in the city of Tabriz. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the association between relevant independent variables (e. g. gender) and the dependent outcome variable (suicidal ideation in the past 12 months). Results Overall, 62 (4. 1 %, 95 % CI= 3. 1, 5. 2) of 1, 517 students had thoughts of suicide. Three hundred and thirteen (20. 6 %, 95 % CI= 18. 6, 22. 7) students reported being bullied in the previous 30 days. In addition, 134 (8. 8 %, 95 % CI= 7. 5, 10. 3) students reported having been sexually abused. Being worried that they could not eat or did not feel hungry (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 4. 15; 95 % Cl [1. 71, 10. 07]; current cigarette smoking (AOR = 3. 00; 95 % CI [1. 69, 5. 30]; thinking about using alcohol or other drugs (AOR = 4. 28; 95 % CI [2. 41, 7. 59]; and being sexually abused (AOR = 2. 63; 95 % CI [1. 32, 5. 24]) were all factors positively associated with suicidal ideation.

The overall {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to assist educators and all stakeholders about the impact of crime and violence on the morale and productivity of educators at Orange Farm. The study deals with the programme of activities that can be implemented at schools to overcome the problem of crime and violence. The overall aim was operationalised as follows: to give a theoretical exposition of concepts morale and productivity, to give an overview of the extent of crime and violence at Orange Farm, to investigate the impact of crime and violence on morale and productivity at Orange Farm, and to offer recommendations that may add value for educators to improve morale and productivity. Crime and violence pose a serious threat to the goal of establishing peace and progress in schools at Orange Farm. In order to establish a safe school environment where learners can learn and educators can teach in a warm and welcoming environment, free of intimidation and fear of violence, it is important to find the cause. There is no one determining factor that could be pinpointed as the origin of school violence and crime. There are so many factors involved which make this a very complex issue which needs as much input and thought as possible. Factors contributing to school crime and violence in Orange Farm have been identified as <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol, <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse,</b> gangsterism, gambling, poverty and unemployment, physical violence, vandalism and burglary.

40|$|Historically, peer {{programs}} have been utilized in school and community settings to address a range of health issues such as HIV/AIDS, <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol abuse, and youth violence. However, in terms of offender rehabilitation, the change process has generally rested upon professional staff, with little formal consideration of the powerful positive influence that offenders can have on fellow offenders. This paper, therefore, suggests that prison-based, peer-led {{programs have}} something to offer to correctional organizations. First, we explore the theoretical underpinnings of peer programs, followed by a general overview of the scarce empirical research on correctional peer programs {{in the areas of}} HIV/AIDS <b>and</b> health education, <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol <b>abuse,</b> <b>sexual</b> assault/offending, prison orientation, and suicide/violence prevention. The discussion then focuses on the difficulties of implementing such programs, as well as their overall appeal for fellow offenders, peers, and the organization itself. We conclude that while preliminary reports of offender-peer programs are positive, controlled research is lacking. To aid in the development of such programs, and promote further research, we provide an outline to effectively implement and evaluate peer programs. It is further concluded that such innovations are important to the future of offender rehabilitation policies and practices. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of adolescent self-harm in Northern Ireland (NI) {{and its associated}} factors are unknown. Given the established relationship between conflict and mental health, and NI׳s recent history of conflict, {{it is important to}} investigate the factors associated with self-harm in NI. This study aimed to determine the {{prevalence of}} self-harm in NI adolescents and the factors associated with it, including exposure to the NI conflict. Methods: Observational study of 3596 school pupils employing an anonymous self-report survey. Information was obtained on demographic characteristics, lifestyle, life events and problems, exposure to the NI conflict, social and internet influences, and psychological variables. Results: Self-harm was reported by 10 % of respondents. In univariate analyses, exposure to the NI conflict was associated with self-harm alongside established risk factors. In multivariate analyses, bullying and exposure to self-harm were associated with lifetime self-harm in both girls and boys. Alcohol use, <b>drug</b> use, physical <b>and</b> <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse,</b> <b>and</b> self-esteem were also associated with self-harm in girls. In boys, absence of exercise, sexual orientation concerns, anxiety and impulsivity were additional risk factors. The internet/social media and the self-harm of others were also key influences. Limitations: This is a cross-sectional study. Conclusions: The rate of self-harm was lower than elsewhere in the UK/Ireland. The study highlights the factors which should be considered in terms of risk assessment. In addition to established risk factors, the findings suggest that more research on the legacy of the NI conflict as well as the influence of new technologies warrant urgent attention...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} alcohol <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> consumption between <b>sexual</b> offenders against boys and girls. Method: It was an observational, retrospective and cross-sectional study {{carried out by the}} Ambulatory for the treatment of sexual disorders of ABC Medical College, Santo Andre, Sao Paulo, Brazil (ABSex). The sample comprised 104 convicts, over 18 years old, sentenced only for sexual crimes against children (below 11 years old). Alcohol <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> consumption, <b>sexual</b> <b>abuse</b> history, <b>sexual</b> impulsivity, <b>and</b> risk of recidivism were evaluated. Results: The sexual offenders against boys showed higher alcohol consumption problems than sexual offenders against girls (chi(2) = 19. 76, 1 d. f., p < 0. 01). The severity of alcohol consumption was also significantly higher in the sexual offenders against non-related boys than in the sexual offenders against non-related girls (p = 0. 037, ANOVA). After adjustment for other variables, such as monthly income before the penalty and alcohol consumption at the moment of the crime, the alcohol consumption severity in sexual offenders against boys was significantly higher than in sexual offenders against girls (OR = 1. 05, CI 1. 01 - 1. 08, p < 0. 01). Conclusions: Alcohol use or abuse is associated with the perpetration of sexual aggression. The role of alcohol consumption seems to be greater in sexual offenders against boys than in girls and this can contribute to criminal recidivism. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Human Movement Science)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. Health risk {{behaviour}} {{is certainly}} one of the most crucial aspects {{in the life of the}} present-day adolescent. According to the literature a healthy lifestyle includes regular exercise, health meals, sufficient rest, recreation and managing stress successfully. Health behaviour activities therefore are lifestyle activities that can affect one's health and wellbeing positively or negatively. Health risk behaviour or an unhealthy lifestyle includes violence, smoking, alcohol <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> <b>abuse,</b> <b>sexual</b> activity, unhealthy diet and a lack of physical activity. The adolescent is easily influenced and susceptible and therefore role models can have a strong influence on the behaviour of the adolescent. Many researchers are of the opinion that high performance sport is inclined to be characterised by health risk behaviour of the participants and also indicate that older sportsmen and -women have a definite influence on the behaviour of younger sportsmen and -women. It was also found that young sportsmen and sportswomen are more exposed to health risk behaviour than non-sportsmen and sportswomen. The aim of the study was, firstly, to establish the health risk behaviour of adolescents of different genders, racial groups and age groups in the Potchefstroom district and to determine if gender, racial groups and age groups had an effect. The second aim was to establish whether the health risk behaviour of sport participants and non-participants differ and if these differences were gender and/or race specific or not. 470 High school pupils (boys n= 205; girls n= 265) of different race groups (white n=l 58; black n= 150; Coloured n=l 14 and Indian n= 48) between 13 and 18 years of age, living in the Potchefstroom district in the North West Province, were involved in the study. The YRBS questionnaire was used to obtain information regarding the health risk behaviour of the pupils. The health risk behaviours included violence, smoking, alcohol <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> <b>abuse,</b> <b>sexual</b> behaviour <b>and</b> physical inactivity. The "Statistica for Windows version 6 " computer programme (Statsoft, Inc. 2003) was used. To process the collected data, descriptive statistics were used to establish the percentage participation in the distinctive health risk practices. Two-way frequency tables were used to determine the relationship between gender, race and age as well as percentage participation or not. Tendencies that were established in this study with regard to the high school pupils' risk behaviour correlate with other national studies, but also show that the occurrence of participation in health risk behaviour in South Africa is lower than that found in international studies. A large percentage of the research group (71 %) reported that they participate in school sports, which indicates that participation in sports plays an important role in the youth culture of high school pupils in the Potchefstroom district. Furthermore it is apparent from the results that there is a higher percentage of participation in 4 of the 6 health risk behaviour activities by sport participants. Non-participants were physically inactive and reported more suicide attempts. Although percentage differences were present between the health risk behaviour of participants in sport and non-participants, it was not practically significant. Furthermore it was found that gender and race did not have a significant effect on the health risk behaviours of high school pupils in the Potchefstroom district. Master...|$|R

The South African society evidences pluralistic values and current social, political and economic change that further renders the issue of individual and group values complex and challenging. Adolescents growing up in South Africa face many social problems such as alcohol <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> <b>abuse,</b> <b>sexual</b> problems, HIV/AIDS pandemic, poverty, teenage pregnancy, violence and family disintegration. This study aimed to address the influence of social factors on South African black adolescents’ moral development by a literature study and empirical inquiry using an interpretive approach. To provide a conceptual framework for the empirical inquiry, a literature study investigated theoretical perspectives on moral development and discussed ecological theories with regard to adolescent development with particular reference to Bronfenbrenner’s model. Furthermore, recent trends with regard to moral development of black adolescents within the South African context were addressed. A qualitative research inquiry was used to explore factors influencing the moral development of {{a small sample of}} eighteen black adolescents who attend a township school in Tshwane, Gauteng. The sample included an equal number of boys and girls. Maximum variation and purposive sampling strategies were used to select information-rich participants. Data gathering was done by individual semi-structured interviews using a moral dilemma question and focus group interviews. Data was analysed by content analysis and Guba’s model of trustworthiness was used to enhance credibility. Measures to ensure ethical research included consent from the Gauteng Department of Education, the principal and parents. Participation was voluntary and pseudonyms were used to protect the identity of participants. The researcher’s role was described. The key themes were organised around person moral behaviour- shapers, including the sub-themes of personal needs, personal ownership, identity, cognition and the influence of academic achievement; social moral behaviour- shapers, including the role of family, peers, church and social media and community moral behaviour-shapers, including congruent application of values and safety. The study concluded with recommendations to enhance the development of moral behaviour among adolescents. Educational StudiesD. Ed. (Socio-Education...|$|R
40|$|Considered one of {{the more}} popular and common forms of {{masculine}} recreation during the 1920 s and 1930 s, taxi-dancing all but disappeared following the years of World War II (Cressey 1932; Vedder 1947; Hong and Duff 1976, 1977). In 2 ̆ 2 Decline of the Taxi-Dance Hall 2 ̆ 2 (1954), Clyde Vedder inaccurately predicted its approaching demise. The taxi-dance hall did survive, however, and may be found today in such metropolitan areas as New York, Detroit, Los Angeles, Honolulu, and Oakland (Hong and Duff, 1977). Moreover, the number in commercial operation has increased dramatically in the state of California since the mid- 1970 s. ^ A principal concern of this study {{is the role of the}} taxi-dancer herself, whom Vedder describes as 2 ̆ 2 the heart and soul of the taxi-dance hall 2 ̆ 2 (Vedder 1947, p. 7; 1954, p. 388). The taxi-dancers themselves are brought 2 ̆ 2 front 2 ̆ 2 stage to voice the contexts defining the personal and professional spheres of their everyday lives. A range of topics is introduced as evidence of the 2 ̆ 2 semi-deviant 2 ̆ 2 status of their work and its effects, including: wage competition, alcohol <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> <b>abuse,</b> <b>sexual</b> exchange, <b>and</b> ageism. ^ A taxi-dancer or dance hostess is usually a Caucasian, Hispanic, or Asian female between the ages of 18 and 25 (sometimes older), employed by a public dance establishment which caters to the tastes of male customers by providing paid women partners for dancing within a reasonably acceptable social sphere. A man can, in effect, 2 ̆ 2 rent 2 ̆ 2 a woman 2 ̆ 7 s company for as long as he likes; thus, the term 2 ̆ 2 taxi-dancer 2 ̆ 2 appears applicable. ^ The primary objective of this research is to accomplish a qualitative, in-field examination of recreational establishments commonly called taxi-dance halls and the unique role of women fulfilling requirements particular to the specific job title of taxi-dancer. I conducted field work in Oakland and Los Angeles, California during the winter of 1986 and the spring of 1987. This dissertation also examines the specific social phenomena, educational and socioeconomic, which channel women into this form of employment. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} examined risk taking, {{with the}} main focus being negative risk taking and the main target adolescent females in a Senior Secondary School setting in Tasmania, using three varied methodologies and perspectives for the data collection. The first, and major method, used a questionnaire distributed to a Year 11 group of females, aged sixteen to nineteen, who were just beginning {{their first year of}} non –compulsory, post secondary education. This questionnaire covered many socio-demographic factors in the females’ lives and had the main focus of discovering their risk taking perceptions and participation rates regarding four main areas of negative risk taking, namely alcohol <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> use <b>and</b> <b>abuse,</b> <b>sexual</b> activity <b>and</b> the viewing of X-Rated (pornographic) videos. The socio-demographic information concentrated on the females’ sense of self, their personal goals and positive and negative risk taking activities within the context of social capital, psychological, social, educational, risk taking and health background theory and in the three domains of family, school and community. Comparisons were drawn between the town and country female participants. To provide a wider perspective on the topic of risk taking, interviews were also conducted with those professionals and carers of adolescent children, namely School Administrators, Teachers, and Parents to provide information from the reality of adolescents’ lives. These adults gave important insights into the actual issues, common to this age group. They provided information regarding the nature of their discussions about risk- taking and the strategies they utilized to produce resilience in adolescents and the avoidance of negative risk-taking activities. The third source of data involved a review of the Australian and State Policies impinging on aspects of the curricula suitable for these adolescents. These policies demonstrated two approaches to the topics under discussion in this thesis. The Australian Government policies gave broad, generic guidelines to the problems associated with negative risk taking and provided funding, whilst the individual States provided the actual curricula and personnel. Funding was a key component for the successful implementation of the State programs. The major findings from the questionnaire emphasised that the females’ sense of self, parental influence and, to a lesser extent, religious values will decrease negative risk taking. The advice from the adults in the interviews focused on maintaining a positive attitude about adolescent risk taking activities, with the use of personal experiences to provide guidelines for appropriate behaviour. The analysis of the policies emphasised the need to provide healthy, supportive environments for adolescents and appropriate information about negative risk taking...|$|R
