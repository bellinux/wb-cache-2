5|$|Despite {{his success}} against the Gepids, Alboin {{had failed to}} greatly {{increase}} his power, and was now faced with a much stronger threat from the Avars. Historians consider this the decisive factor in convincing Alboin to undertake a migration, {{even though there are}} indications that before the war with the Gepids a decision was maturing to leave for Italy, a country thousands of Lombards <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 550s when hired by the Byzantines to fight in the Gothic War. Additionally, the Lombards would have known of the weakness of Byzantine Italy, which had endured a number of problems after being retaken from the Goths. In particular the so-called Plague of Justinian had ravaged the region and conflict remained endemic, with the Three-Chapter Controversy sparking religious opposition and administration at a standstill after the able governor of the peninsula, Narses, was recalled. Nevertheless, the Lombards viewed Italy as a rich land which promised great booty, assets Alboin used to gather together a horde which included not only Lombards but many other peoples of the region, including Heruli, Suebi, Gepids, Thuringii, Bulgars, Sarmatians, the remaining Romans and a few Ostrogoths. But the most important group, other than the Lombards, were the Saxons, of whom 20,000 male warriors with their families participated in the trek. These Saxons were tributaries to the Frankish King Sigebert, and their participation indicates that Alboin had the support of the Franks for his venture.|$|E
25|$|Bergman {{strongly}} admired {{two films}} by Italian director Roberto Rossellini that she <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States. In 1949, Bergman wrote to Rossellini, expressing this admiration and suggesting that she {{make a film}} with him. This led to her being cast in his film Stromboli (1950). During production, Bergman {{fell in love with}} Rossellini, and they began an affair. Bergman became pregnant with their son, Renato Roberto Ranaldo Giusto Giuseppe ("Robin") Rossellini (born 2 February 1950).|$|E

25|$|Coleman Coliseum is a 15,383-seat {{multipurpose}} arena {{that serves}} as the city of Tuscaloosa's municipal civic center. Because the City of Tuscaloosa does not have a civic center, the demand for events grew rapidly and the Coliseum doubled its capacity in the 1970s. In the 1990s, marquee concerts and events that the arena <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous two decades grew scarce as the facility became more outdated and mostly devoted to Crimson Tide athletic events. In the hope that the University could pull more events at the facility, the Coliseum underwent a significant renovation in 2005, costing over $24 million.|$|E

25|$|The {{prefrontal cortex}} (and in {{particular}} the right hemisphere) is also involved {{in the formation of}} new episodic memories (also known as episodic encoding). Patients with damage to the prefrontal cortex can learn new information, but tend to do so in a disordered fashion. For example, they might show normal recognition of an object they <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past, but fail to recollect when or where it had been viewed. Some researchers believe that the prefrontal cortex helps organize information for more efficient storage, drawing upon its role in executive function. Others believe that the prefrontal cortex underlies semantic strategies which enhance encoding, such as thinking about the meaning of the study material or rehearsing it in working memory.|$|E
25|$|The Cowboys had {{a chance}} to score in the third quarter with the ball on LSU's one-yard line on first down. However, the Tigers came up with another {{goal-line}} stand, this time by the White Team with a fumble recovery. In the fourth quarter, Hardin-Simmons had another chance as it drove down to the LSU 14-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs after an incomplete pass on fourth down. The game featured much more passing than LSU <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous two games. Hardin-Simmons, whose head coach Baugh was a former star quarterback in the National Football League, was a passing-minded team. While LSU rushed for 204 yards, Hardin-Simmons passed for 201 yards on 19 completions. Warren Rabb, who was playing despite {{the death of his father}} that morning, completed six passes for 88 yards. For the third game in a row, Cannon was the leading rusher with 83 yards and a touchdown on eleven carries.|$|E
25|$|On 27 and 28 June {{and again}} on 7 July heavy rain events {{occurred}} from powerful thunderstorms that gathered strength as they travelled across mainland Britain. Severe weather warnings {{and a number of}} flood alerts were issued by the UK's Environment Agency, and many areas were hit by flash floods that overwhelmed properties and caused power cuts. A motorist was killed after his vehicle was caught by floodwater and landslides halted rail services between England and Scotland. The thunderstorms were the product of two fronts that collided over the British Isles– warm air travelling from the Azores and cold water-ladened air from the west. The second batch of flooding struck the South-West of England during the afternoon of 7 July, forcing the Met Office to issue its highest alert, Red (Take Action), due to the significant amounts of rainfall caused by a system travelling from Southern Europe, along with the warm, humid air the United Kingdom <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> run-up to the floods, which, like the June floods, caused thunderstorms.|$|E

25|$|Sadly Johnny Moyes died {{suddenly}} {{on the first}} day of the two day match and his book on the series was completed by Tom Goodman of the Sydney Morning Herald. Due to the exciting Third Test a large crowd came to Newcastle, New South Wales to watch Northern New South Wales, with players from Newcastle, Canberra and Wollongong making up the side. The morning was lost to rain, the local captain won the toss, put the MCC in to bat and got them 180/6, despite Geoff Pullar making 53, but Barry Knight (73) and Alan Smith (45) adding 103 for the seventh-wicket and the MCC finished on 319. Douglas Dives (73) and Rodney Harvey (37) and Ken King (32) made most of the runs in the reply as Northern NSW were out for 203, Len Coldwell took 3/32 and David Allen 3/35. Batting again Dexter made 71 not out and Tom Graveney 41 before the MCC innings was declared at 190/4, leaving the home team 301 to win. After Max Fox (31) and Boxsell (40) added 68 for the first wicket they collapsed to 128/9 as Allen (5/38), Graveney (2/21) and Pullar (3/26) span them out. The crowd were determined to invade the ground on the point of victory, as they <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sydney Test, but last man Gilmour held everybody up by throwing his bat around for 29 in a last wicket stand of 33. When he was finally caught by Dexter off Geoff Pullar the enthusiastic crowd climbed the fences. Fred Trueman was bowled over and had his cap taken, but he soon recovered it and the teams ran off the field.|$|E

500|$|However, Barnes {{received}} {{criticism for}} this approach, including from Fingleton, who fielded there during his playing career.

Bradman later touted Barnes as the best fieldsman he <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> position, while England skipper Yardley admitted [...] Barnes had worried the home team's players. Fingleton {{said that if the}} position was unfair, then it was the umpires' duty to take action. He further said the batsmen should have tried to deter Barnes from standing so close by aiming shots at him, deeming the Australian to be [...] "of great value in a nuisance capacity throughout the tour". After several near-misses, he was finally hit in the Third Test and missed two weeks of cricket, but he was not injured again after his resumption.

When Morse in Sandy 07 first got the call, he thought that, because the aircraft had gone down in South Vietnam, the SAR effort could be accomplished fairly quickly. When he got over Hambelton's position, he was shocked at the amount of ground fire he received. It was more intense than anything he <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> war.

500|$|The petrels {{breeding}} in {{the high}} central mountains of Madeira were first recorded in 1903 by German naturalist and priest Ernst Johann Schmitz, who failed to realise that they were different from the Fea's petrels he <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Desertas. The species was formally described as a race of soft-plumaged petrel by Australian amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews in 1934. Following {{the recognition of the}} Madeiran birds as a full species, they were named after the Portuguese ornithologist, Paul Alexander Zino, who was instrumental in their conservation during {{the latter half of the}} twentieth century. The genus name Pterodroma is derived from Greek πτερον, pteron, [...] "a wing", and δρομος, dromos, [...] "running", and refers to the bird's swift erratic flight. The specific madeira refers to the island on which it breeds. The Portuguese name Freira means [...] "nun"; the inhabitants of Curral das Freiras (Nun's Valley) near the breeding site claimed that the nocturnal wailing of the petrels in the breeding season were the calls of the suffering souls of the nuns. The sisters had taken refuge in the valley from attacks on the island by French pirates in 1566 that lasted for 15 days.|$|E

Determined to win a spot on the show, Stewie decides to cross-dress as a woman, naming his new identity [...] "Karina Smirnoff". Beginning his audition, he starts by telling a completely fabricated story. Convincing the producers that he is telling a true tale, he wins the role. The next morning, on the first day of filming, Stewie as Karina introduces himself to the rest of the cast, and quickly falls in love with a female co-star named Julie. Another co-star, Randall, objects to the new role that Karina was cast to play, and takes Julie away from him to prevent their friendship. As they continue shooting, however, the two develop a friendly relationship, eventually deciding to hold a sleepover, where they become even closer. The next day, Julie professes her love for Karina by wishing that she was actually a boy, causing Stewie, as Karina, to come on to her. Julie insists that she is not a lesbian, so Stewie decides to unveil his true identity to the entire cast during a live taping of the show. Shocked that Karina was actually a boy, Julie's mother refuses to let her speak to him, with Stewie left to regret his decision to come out as a cross-dresser, and decides to go get ice cream with Brian, as he can no longer wear that dress.|$|E
