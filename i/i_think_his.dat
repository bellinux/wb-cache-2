The only thing I can really remember is that, when I was being brought home in a car, I was in that wonderful state of half-awakeness in which you hear all sorts of incredible sounds going through your mind. They were all orchestral sounds, but I was playing them all, and suddenly I was Hofmann. I was enchanted.|$|E
500|$|Actor Daniel Dae Kim {{enjoyed the}} fight scene {{between him and}} guest actor Tony Lee, commenting that [...] "I really {{appreciate}} the fact that 's just a down-and-dirty street fighter. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> style of fighting fits his character". He continued [...] "it was great to see a different layer to Sun's character. Because previously she had always been the good wife, and Jin was the bad husband". Actress Yunjin Kim added that [...] "now we know that 's not what she's been advertised to be for the last two seasons, but actually {{she has a lot of}} secrets." ...|$|E
500|$|Kruger was by {{this time}} widely {{perceived}} as a personification of Afrikanerdom {{both at home and}} abroad. When he stopped going to the government offices at the Raadsaal by foot and began to be conveyed there by a presidential carriage, his coming and going became a public spectacle not unlike the Changing of the Guard in Britain. [...] "Once seen, he is not easily forgotten", wrote Lady Phillips. [...] "His greasy frock coat and antiquated tall hat have been portrayed times without number... and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> character is clearly to be read in his face—strength of character and cunning." ...|$|E

And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that was <b>his</b> big selling point, {{that he was so}} full of energy. You know when you hear his records it was dynamite energy. — Herb Jeffries ...|$|R

500|$|Waxy first {{stood at}} Lewes {{for a fee}} of 10 guineas per mare and a groom fee of 10 shillings. In September 1803, Sir Ferdinando Poole offered to sell Waxy for 700 guineas to William Lightfoot, an agent sent to buy horses for Virginian turfman John Tayloe. Lightfoot refused to buy Waxy, writing to Tayloe, [...] "he has lost an eye, and is {{thirteen}} years old, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> health bad." [...] Instead Lightfoot purchased Waxy's half-sister Keren Happuch who was covered by Waxy that year. It is unclear how Waxy lost his eye, its loss occurring sometime between 1797 and 1803. Sir Ferdinando Poole died on 8 June 1804, and Waxy was then acquired by the Duke of Grafton and relocated to the Euston Hall stud near Newmarket. Under the Duke's ownership, his fee increased to 25 guineas per mare and he covered 40 mares per season.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} well {{received}} by {{the cast and crew}} of The X-Files. Producer J.P. Finn praised the episode and Carter's directing, saying [...] "We were all pretty nervous doing that one, because Chris Carter was a new director. It turned out that he directed very...It was a great script, a great cast, and he ended up directing a home run. One of the charming things about it was the end, where we had these alien heads placed on young children. It was so endearing to see them on the set between takes, playing with Chris and everyone". Actor David Duchovny said of Carter's directing [...] "Chris came in meticulously prepared, which is his nature. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> first episode was great". Carter himself described it as one of his favorite episodes because [...] "it was a chance for me to sort of do it all, and it came out in ways better than I imagined it would".|$|E
500|$|Trescothick {{was unable}} to avoid a {{recurrence}} of his previous difficulties when travelling abroad, however, and returned home on 15 October, citing the same [...] "stress related illness". Brian Rose, who Trescothick had approached initially after Somerset's defeat by Trinidad and Tobago on 12 October, released {{a statement to the}} media stating [...] "Marcus admitted {{a couple of days ago}} that he wasn't 100% so that's fair enough. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> future will be in domestic cricket and that may even help him with this particular form of illness. I think over the next two or three years you'll see Marcus Trescothick performing wonderfully well in county cricket." [...] Michael Vaughan, who had by then retired from cricket, praised Trescothick's [...] "courageous" [...] decision, as did Vikram Solanki, then PCA chairman. Journalist Andrew Miller called for an end to the rising criticism of Trescothick's decision from the public, while Paul Hayward of the Guardian also derided those critical of the Somerset player's actions. Despite returning home, Trescothick continued to affirm his commitment to the club by signing a new three-year contract with optional fourth year, in December. He was named captain for the 2010 season.|$|E
500|$|Carice van Houten, who portrays Melisandre, {{spoke about}} the resurrection, {{and how it was}} directed, {{mentioning}} [...] "It was such an important scene, we shot it from so many angles. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> washed <b>his</b> body 50 times." ...|$|R

500|$|Gavin Hood was {{announced}} {{as director of}} the project in July 2007 for a 2008 release. Previously, X-Men and X2 director Bryan Singer and [...] director Brett Ratner were interested in returning to the franchise, while Alexandre Aja and Len Wiseman also wanted the job. Zack Snyder, who was approached for The Last Stand, turned down this film because he was directing Watchmen. Jackman saw parallels between Logan and the main character in Hood's previous film Tsotsi. Hood explained that while he was not a comic book fan, he [...] "realized that the character of Wolverine, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> great appeal {{lies in the fact that}} he's someone who in some ways, is filled with a great deal of self-loathing by his own nature and he's constantly at war with his own nature". The director described the film's themes as focusing on Wolverine's inner struggle between his animalistic savagery and noble human qualities. Hood enjoyed the previous films, but set out to give the spin-off a different feel. Hood also suggested to make the implied blood relation of Wolverine and Sabretooth into them explicitly being half brothers, as it would help [...] "build up the emotional power of the film". In October, Fox announced a May 1, 2009, release date and the X-Men Origins prefix.|$|E
500|$|During the 90s, new manga author Masashi Kishimoto {{sought to}} write a {{one-shot}} chapter that would feature Naruto as a chef, but this version {{never made it to}} print. Kishimoto originally wanted to make Naruto a child who could transform into a fox, so he created a one-shot of Naruto for the summer 1997 issue of Akamaru Jump magazine based on the idea. For the serialized version, Kishimoto incorporated traits he felt made an ideal hero in the creation of Naruto: a straightforward way of thinking, a mischievous side, and attributes possessed by Goku from the Dragon Ball franchise. Aiming to keep Naruto [...] "simple and stupid", Kishimoto avoided modeling him after anyone in particular, instead conceiving of him as naïve with a dark side resulting from his harsh past. Despite this, he is always optimistic, a trait Kishimoto said makes this character unique. By and large, Naruto's personality is childish; the creator tried to convey this trait in his illustrations. Kishimoto notes as an example of this the cover of volume 10, where Kishimoto depicts Naruto mimicking a turtle as a child might do. Naruto was Kishimoto's first published manga, and he focused on making Naruto's facial expressions consistent in difficult situations. He commented: [...] "It's rather awkward to talk about what makes Naruto appealing to audiences, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> being a knucklehead gives him an appeal." [...] He believed it was Naruto's losses that made readers identify with him, although he wanted Naruto not to feel defeat again, which was his primary aim when writing the series. Kishimoto has said that Naruto's burning desire to be a ninja was based on his own ambition to succeed as a manga artist.|$|E
500|$|Upon its {{publication}} in English in early 2009, The Kindly Ones received mixed reviews. The New Republics literary critic Ruth Franklin called it [...] "one {{of the most}} repugnant books I have ever read [...] if getting under {{the skin of a}} murderer were sufficient to produce a masterpiece, then Thomas Harris would be Tolstoy." [...] Michiko Kakutani, the principal book critic of The New York Times, called the novel [...] "illfully sensationalistic and deliberately repellent" [...] and went on to question the [...] "perversity" [...] of the French literary establishment for praising the novel. In a reply to Kakutani, writer and novelist Michael Korda wrote, [...] "You want to read about Hell, here it is. If you don’t have the strength to read it, tough shit. It’s a dreadful, compelling, brilliantly researched, and imagined masterpiece, a terrifying literary achievement, and perhaps the first work of fiction {{to come out of the}} Holocaust that places us in its very heart, and keeps us there." [...] Writing for Time, American writer and journalist Lev Grossman compared it to Roberto Bolaño's 2666, similar in [...] "their seriousness of purpose, their wild overestimation of the reader's attention span and their interest in physical violence that makes Saw look like Dora the Explorer," [...] but added that while far from perfect, The Kindly Ones [...] "is unmistakably the work of a profoundly gifted writer, if not an especially disciplined one." [...] In her review for Los Angeles Times, novelist and essayist Laila Lalami wrote: [...] "Jonathan Littell has undertaken a very ambitious project in The Kindly Ones, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> boldness deserves to be commended. In the end, however, his highly problematic characterization and awkward handling of point of view make this book far more successful as a dramatized historical document than as a novel." [...] British historian Antony Beevor, author of Stalingrad and The Fall of Berlin 1945, reviewing The Kindly Ones in The Times, called it [...] "a great work of literary fiction, to which readers and scholars will turn for decades to come," [...] and listed it as one of the top five books of World War II fiction.|$|E

Ramsey responded to Keynes's urging by writing three papers in economic theory {{all of which were}} of fundamental importance, though it was many years before they received their proper recognition by the community of economists.|$|E
2500|$|Orwell was openly homophobic, at a {{time when}} such {{prejudice}} was common. Speaking at the 2003 George Orwell Centenary Conference, Daphne Patai said: [...] "Of course he was homophobic.

That is definitely the case. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> writing reflects that quite fully." ...|$|E

Until that match, Stu Wilson of New Zealand reigned as the world's champion winger, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> reign ended that day. Campese turned it on with the goose-step and trumped Wilson completely. We all knew then that someone really special had come on the scene.|$|E

2500|$|By the 1960s, Budge {{and others}} had added Pancho Gonzales and Lew Hoad {{to the list of}} contenders. Budge {{reportedly}} believed that Gonzales was the greatest player ever. Gonzales said about Hoad, [...] "When Lew's game was at its peak nobody could touch him.... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> game was the best game ever. Better than mine. He was capable of making more shots than anybody. His two volleys were great. His overhead was enormous. He had the most natural tennis mind with the most natural tennis physique." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the wake}} of a sex scandal (see 2010 mayoral campaign), fellow {{councilor}} Brian Ashton called for Giambrone to resign as chairman of the TTC, which had been beset by bad publicity. Ashton said [...] "The TTC is under serious assault around issues of customer relations and performance. The union is now fragmented from the management. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> moral authority has been totally debased and undermined," [...] said Ashton. [...] "I think mentally he's going to be distracted by both his mayoralty bid and this sex scandal. His ability {{to come to terms with}} the TTC issues is tremendously weakened." [...] He did not step down, but also did not seek re-election and so his term as TTC chair ended in December, 2010.|$|E

2500|$|As Button's {{place as}} the {{pre-eminent}} British driver in Formula One was effectively taken by Lewis Hamilton, former champion Nigel Mansell criticised Button, saying: [...] "Jenson should have won more races, he has under-performed and that is down to him." [...] Honda team boss Nick Fry defended his driver, saying: [...] "I would refute everything Nigel has said, and particularly <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> comments about Jenson's reputation for partying are about five years out of date...his increasing maturity {{and the way he}} changed his lifestyle is extremely noticeable." [...] Button made no secret of his frustration regarding his current situation; he described his 2007 season as [...] "a total disaster". Button did, however, record several impressive outings {{towards the end of the}} season, especially when rain was prominent.|$|E
2500|$|Fisher was {{appointed}} to command [...] as flag captain to the Admiral of the North America and West Indies Station, Astley Cooper Key, from 2 March 1877 to 4 June 1878. Bellerophon {{had been in the}} dockyard for repairs, so the new crew was less than perfect in carrying out their duties. Fisher told them I intend to give you hell for three months, and if you have not come up to my standard in that time you'll have hell for another three months. Midshipman (later Admiral) A. H. Gordon Moore reported, Fisher was a very exacting master and I had at times long and arduous duties, long hours at the engine room telegraphs in cold fog, etc., and the least inattention was punished. It was, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>his</b> way of proving us, for he always rewarded us in some way when an extra hard bit of work was over.|$|E
2500|$|Hayek never {{produced}} the book-length treatment of [...] "the dynamics of capital" [...] {{that he had}} promised in the Pure Theory of Capital. [...] After 1941, he continued to publish works on the economics of information, political philosophy, the theory of law, and psychology, but seldom on macroeconomics. At the University of Chicago, Hayek {{was not part of}} the economics department, and did not influence the rebirth of neoclassical theory that took place there (see Chicago school of economics). [...] When, in 1974, he shared the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics with Gunnar Myrdal, the latter complained about being paired with an [...] "ideologue". Milton Friedman declared himself [...] "an enormous admirer of Hayek, but not for his economics. [...] I think Prices and Production is a very flawed book. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> [...] is unreadable. [...] On the other hand, The Road to Serfdom is one of the great books of our time." ...|$|E
