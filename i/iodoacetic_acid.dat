40|$|Emerging {{halogenated}} acetic acids (HAAs), especially mixed halogenated acids such as chlorobromo, chloroiodo- and bromoiodo-acetic acids, are unregulated disinfection by-products {{in drinking}} water. Because these compounds are hydrophilic and strongly acidic, they {{are difficult to}} detect at trace levels using approved analytical methods. In the present study, 13 HAM were effectively separated on three ultra-performance liquid chromatography columns. The effects of changing in the aqueous mobile phase, acidic solutions and cationic volatile ion pair reagents were investigated. The samples were pretreated by filtration, and extraction, while derivatization and concentration procedures were not required. The limits of quantitation for regulated HAAs were between 0. 5 mu g/L and 1. 7 mu g/L, and for unregulated HAAs were 1. 2 and 5. 8 mu g/L, especially for the iodinated acetic acids were 1. 5 and 2. 1 mu g/L. The method was applied to two finished water samples collected in China (Shanghai and Xuzhou) from water treatment plants that use chlorine for disinfection. Multiple unregulated HAAs {{were found in the}} two samples, but iodoacids were only detected in the water sample from Shanghai, which could be attributed to the characteristics of the source water. The presence of unregulated HAAs, especially mixed bromo- and <b>iodoacetic</b> <b>acids,</b> in the finished water samples could affect human health, and this warrants further investigation.

The modification of tryptophan residues {{led to a}} compete loss of hemagglutinating activity; however, the addition of mannose was able to prevent this loss of activity. The results indicate that two tryptophan residues {{are involved in the}} carbohydrate-binding site. Modifications of the carboxyl group residues produced an 80 % loss of activity, but the presence of mannose protected against the modification. The results suggest that the carboxyl groups of aspartic and glutamic acids are involved in the carbohydrate-binding site of the lectin. However, oxidation of the carbohydrate chain and modification of the histidine and arginine residues did not affect the hemagglutinating, activity of MDL. Fluorescence studies of MDL indicate that tryptophan residues are present in a relatively hydrophobic region, and the binding of mannose to MDL could quench tryptophan fluorescence without any change in. The circular dichroism spectrum showed that all of these modifications affected the conformation of the MDL molecule to different extents, except the modification of arginine residues. Fluorescence quenching showed that acrylamide and <b>iodoacetic</b> <b>acids</b> are able to quench 77 % and 98 % of the fluorescence of tryptophan in MDL, respectively. However, KI produced a barely perceptible effect on the fluorescence of MDL, even when the concentration of I- was 0. 15 M.
