25|$|<b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>take</b> the one-parameter {{subgroup}} {{generated by}} any elliptic Möbius transformation, we obtain a continuous transformation, such that every {{transformation in the}} subgroup fixes the same two points.

25|$|Instead {{of actions}} on sets, one can define actions of groups and monoids on objects of an {{arbitrary}} category: {{start with an}} object X of some category, and then define an action on X as a monoid homomorphism into the monoid of endomorphisms of X. If X has an underlying set, then all definitions and facts stated above can be carried over. For example, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>take</b> the category of vector spaces, we obtain group representations in this fashion.|$|E
25|$|To employ this formula, {{one has to}} {{identify}} a critical controlled source for the particular amplifier circuit in hand. For example, P could be the control parameter {{of one of the}} controlled sources in a two-port network, as shown for a particular case in D'Amico et al. As a different example, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>take</b> a12 = a12 = 1, P = A, a22 = – (negative feedback) and a11 = 0 (no feedforward), we regain the simple result with two unidirectional blocks.|$|E
25|$|A1 is an axiom schema {{rather than}} an axiom by virtue of {{containing}} metavariables, namely m, i, n, and j0 through jm-1. The actual axioms of the axiomatization are obtained by setting the metavariables to specific values. For example, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>take</b> m= n= i= j0= 1, we can compute the two bits of ioĵ from i1= 0 and i0= 1, so ioĵ= 2 (or 10 when written as a two-bit number). The resulting instance, namely 1f1(1f1)= 1f2, expresses the familiar axiom ¬¬x= x of double negation. Rule R3 then allows us to infer ¬¬¬x= ¬x by taking s0 to be 1f1(1f1) or ¬¬x0, t0 to be 1f2 or x0, and m'f'i to be 1'f'1 or ¬.|$|E

25|$|<b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>take</b> the one-parameter {{subgroup}} {{generated by}} any loxodromic Möbius transformation, we obtain a continuous transformation, such that every {{transformation in the}} subgroup fixes the same two points. All other points flow along a certain family of curves, away from the first fixed point and toward the second fixed point. Unlike the hyperbolic case, these curves are not circular arcs, but certain curves which under stereographic projection from the sphere to the plane appear as spiral curves which twist counterclockwise infinitely often around one fixed point and twist clockwise infinitely often around the other fixed point. In general, the two fixed points may be any two distinct points on the Riemann sphere.|$|E
25|$|Jacques Lacan: Lacan {{went beyond}} the {{proposition}} that the unconscious is a structure that lies beneath the conscious world; the unconscious itself is structured, like a language. This would suggest parallels with Jung. Further Lacan's Symbolic and Imaginary orders may be aligned with Jung's archetypal theory and personal unconscious respectively. The Symbolic order patterns the contents of the Imaginary {{in the same way that}} archetypal structures predispose humans towards certain sorts of experience. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>take</b> the example of parents, archetypal structures and the Symbolic order predispose our recognition of, and relation to them. Lacan's concept of the Real approaches Jung's elaboration of the psychoid unconscious, which may be seen as true but cannot be directly known. Lacan posited that the unconscious is organised in an intricate network governed by association, above all 'metaphoric associations'. The existence of the network is shown by analysis of the unconscious products: dreams, symptoms, and so on.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Boston Herald, Sargent called Revenge [...] "a ticking bomb waiting to go off. ... Sid Sheinberg (president of MCA Inc., parent company of Universal Pictures) expects a miracle – and we're going to make it happen." [...] Sargent got a call from Sheinberg in late September 1986, asking him to direct the fourth Jaws movie with no script yet written. Said Sargent, [...] "I didn't have time to laugh because Sid explained he wanted to do a quality picture about human beings. When he told me, 'It's your baby, you produce and direct,' I accepted." [...] According to Sargent, Sheinberg [...] "cut through all the slow lanes and got Jaws: The Revenge off and running." [...] In a 2006 interview, Sargent stated that the premise was born [...] "out of a little bit of desperation to find something fresh to do with the shark. We thought that maybe <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>take</b> a mystical point of view, and go for a little bit of...magic, {{we might be able to}} find something interesting enough to sit through." ...|$|E

Harkins, {{head of the}} US {{military}} mission to Vietnam, Diệm joked: [...] "I shouldn't have {{put him in the}} air force, because I had put his father in jail years ago". Diệm went on to predict that [...] "sometime I'm going to get shot right {{in the back of the}} neck. Sometime they'll get me that way". (He and Nhu were deposed and shot dead during the November 1963 coup.) Diệm reacted to the assassination attempt by cracking down on political dissidents and further tightening control of the press. Off the record, one official admitted that [...] "e don't even talk about freedom of the press or ask for other liberties any more... had completely surrounded himself in a protective oligarchy". Nhu justified further anti-opposition restrictions, remarking that [...] "here's always going to be an opposition. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>take</b> these people in, there will be another opposition springing up, because they are controversial men." [...] Madame Nhu added, [...] "ou open a window to let in light and air, not bullets. We want freedom, but we don't want to be exploited by it." ...|$|E
500|$|Several of the book's episodes {{have drawn}} {{attention}} for the insight they offer into the culture, structure and conflicts of traditional society before 1900. Commenting on this characteristic, Djuvara asserted: [...] "even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>take</b> {{into account that}} the grown-up will embellish, transfigure, 'enrich' the memories of his childhood, how could we not recognize the sincerity in Creangă's heart-warming evocation of his childhood's village?" [...] The book stays true to life in depicting ancient customs: discussing the impact of paganism on traditional Romanian customs, Marcu Beza communicated a detail of Creangă's account, which shows how January 1 celebrations of Saint Basil opposed the loud buhai players reenacting a fertility rite to people preferring a quieter celebration. The work also offers details on the traditional roles of a rural society {{such as that of}} Humulești, in the context of social change. Muguraș Constantinescu highlights the important roles of old men and women within Nică's universe, and especially that of his grandfather and [...] "clan leader" [...] David Creangă. The latter, she notes, is an [...] "enlightened man" [...] displaying [...] "the wisdom and balance of the ripe age", a person able to insist on the importance of education, and a churchgoer who frowns on [...] "his wife's bigotry." [...] The seniors' regulatory role within the village is evidenced throughout the book, notoriously so in the episode where the boy captures a hoopoe who bothers his morning sleep, only to be tricked into releasing it by old man, who understands the bird's vital role as village alarm clock.|$|E
