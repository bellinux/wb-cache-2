To earn this rating, which the filmmakers were contractually bound by Disney to do, Adamson altered {{a shot of}} a fallen helmet {{to make clear that}} it did not contain a severed head. Adamson made {{numerous}} edits to the film beforehand after showing the film to a young audience, explaining [...] "When you sit down and you're watching it, and you see the kids' faces while making the film, you're just making an attempt, you're making it exciting, you're doing all of these things because you're essentially making the film for yourself. When you start showing it to an audience, that then influences <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> the film." ...|$|E

2500|$|Most of {{the support}} for the Quantification Settlement Agreement has been {{associated}} with government agencies, on both the state and federal level. Numerous government agencies produced press releases that touted the benefits of the agreement. Many of these releases noted that this was the largest water transfer agreement in American history. Although residents of the Imperial Valley have been the main opponents of this measure, some observers have embraced the agreement, arguing that it is the most realistic and pragmatic solution to the water crisis in the area. Brad Jennings, a tentative supporter of the agreement, notes that [...] "There are things most agree on: The Salton Sea must be saved. No matter <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> water transfers you know that a dead Sea would be an environmental disaster for us. And our water rights and water allotment must be protected. That means we may have to give some up, which is what the QSA was designed to do." [...] He also argued that the measure would likely prevent federal intervention, a concern of many residents of the Imperial Valley.|$|E
2500|$|The {{characters}} of Fairy Tail have received both praise and criticism from publications dedicated to anime, manga, and other media. Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network describes the characters' styles {{as having a}} [...] "strong 'bite me' vibe" [...] and compared the visual style to that of One Piece author Eiichiro Oda. In his review of the second volume, Kimlinger said that Cancer's fighting style [...] "is a kick". In reviewing the first DVD/Blu-ray volume of Fairy Tail, Carlo Santos of Anime News Network says [...] "with a lead character as pumped-up as Natsu, it's hard not {{to get caught up}} in his energy". Santos also praises Happy, citing his character as an [...] "entertaining diversion, proving that animal sidekicks can be fun to listen to and not just a necessary annoyance". In his reviews of the Blu-ray/DVDs, Neil Lumbard of DVD Talk mentions the [...] "strong likeability factor of each of the main characters". Anime News Network writer Rebecca Silverman, in her review of the 20th volume, said, [...] "Mashima still manages to get some action and laughs in as well, including one especially funny subplot involving Gajeel. Wendy takes over from Lucy as the primary female of the series for most of this volume, and <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>about</b> that will probably depend upon which character you prefer." [...] Silverman also thought that readers [...] "may have had mixed feelings about Jellal's return earlier in this arc, but the bond between him and Erza has been underlying their scenes for most of their page time together [...]" [...] However, she said that [...] "for the romantics in the audience, Jellal is still a criminal, and the government wants him. And so they come for him," [...] and pointed out that [...] "Erza fans and detractors will find it deepens her character a little while still finding it sad." ...|$|E
