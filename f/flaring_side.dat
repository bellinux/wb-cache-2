50|$|Conflicting county records {{give the}} date of {{construction}} as either 1919 or 1927, but the county's official date is 1919. Features include semi-elliptical portal arches, ribbon windows under the eaves, and <b>flared</b> <b>side</b> walls.

60|$|A second {{boat had}} been lowered, and the outfit of the shore party was landed rapidly. A {{dozen of the}} crew put the knocked-down boats {{together}} on the beach. There were five of these craft--lean and narrow, with <b>flaring</b> <b>sides,</b> and remarkably long. Each was equipped with three paddles and several iron-shod poles.|$|R

5000|$|Egret {{was unique}} in that she had higher, <b>flaring</b> <b>sides</b> than the typical sharpie and was double-ended. This meant more {{stability}} as she was loaded {{and the ability to}} run before a following sea without waves breaking over the stern. These attributes contributed to behavior that led the Commodore to call the Egret a [...] "sharpie-lifeboat".|$|R
5000|$|McKenzie River dory or [...] "Drift Boat" [...] by some. A more {{traditional}} [...] "hard sided" [...] boat. The design {{is characterized by}} a wide, flat bottom, <b>flared</b> <b>sides,</b> a narrow, flat bow, a pointed stern, and extreme rocker in the bow and stern to allow the boat to spin about its center for ease in maneuvering in rapids.|$|R

5000|$|Among typical Rhodes designs is the Rhodes 22. It is a 22 ft long {{sailboat}} {{manufactured by}} General Boats in Edenton, North Carolina. R-22 boats {{are easy to}} trailer and launch compared to most sailboats of this size. They feature a shoal draft keel and swinging diamond board combination [...] {{that allows them to}} anchor AND sail in shallow water. The hull features <b>flared</b> <b>sides</b> which provide spray deflection resulting in a very dry ride. The <b>flared</b> <b>sides</b> also provide reserve flotation when heeled over. These features are similar to the earlier Lofland Picnic 17 designed by Nils Lucander around 1959 and sold by Lofland Sailcraft Inc. of Kansas. [...] The R-22 appears to be an enlarged and enhanced derivative of the Picnic 17, with Philip Rhodes as the naval architect, and years of user feedback and improvements. The specs for the Rhodes 22 cite a weight of 2,900 pounds, with 700 pounds of ballast, while a bare bones Picnic 17 weighs in at only 700 pounds.|$|R
50|$|After a {{moderate}} start {{to his first}} season in 1976-1977, Murray decided to modify the hull of his Color 7 skiff. The original design had <b>flared</b> <b>sides</b> and was nearly ten feet wide at the beam. Murray cut the sides and bow and changed the shape before shipping her off to New Zealand where he won the 1977 Giltinan Championship with an incredible final race win.|$|R
50|$|A Drift Boat is an {{evolution}} of the open-water dory, converted for use in rivers. The design {{is characterized by a}} wide, flat bottom, <b>flared</b> <b>sides,</b> a narrow, flat bow, and a pointed stern. A Rocker is used along an arc from bow to stern along the bottom of the boat. It is this constant rocker that allows the boat to spin about its center for ease in maneuvering in rapids.|$|R
50|$|Sharpies are {{a type of}} hard chined {{sailboat}} with a flat bottom, extremely shallow draft, centreboards and straight, <b>flaring</b> <b>sides.</b> They {{are believed}} to have originated in the New Haven, Connecticut region of Long Island Sound, United States. They were traditional fishing boats used for oystering, and later appeared in other areas. With centerboards and shallow balanced rudders they are well suited to sailing in shallow tidal waters.|$|R
50|$|The Q Stock {{consisted}} of various District line trains built from 1923 (G Stock) until the mid-1930s, originally built with manually operated sliding doors. Following conversion to air operated doors, the trains became collectively known as Q Stock. Given that five {{different types of}} rolling stock were converted to Q Stock, the resulting hybrid trains looked bizarre - with the older carriages having flat sides and clerestory roofs, whilst the Q38 had <b>flared</b> <b>sides</b> at floor level.|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{research}} has been conducted on stair safety as a loss of balance due to a misplaced step on a stair can result in a fall and serious injury. One aspect of stair safety that has not been well studied is oblique (angled) stair descent/ascent. Since oblique stair geometry affects the distance travelled and the theoretical symmetry of one’s stance, there are potential implications for fall risk. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether there are adaptations in foot placement that pedestrians demonstrate when descending stairs at oblique angles. Sixteen participants descended steps along two paths – 0 and 45 degrees. Kinematic data of the lower limbs were collected to calculate average step length, average step width, and toe placement. The data suggest that pedestrians compensate for angled descent by narrowing their step width and using a biased foot placement relative to the step edges, such that the inside foot (the foot furthest from the <b>flared</b> <b>side)</b> lands further forward on the step than the outside foot (the foot closest to the <b>flared</b> <b>side).</b> These variations from straight stair descent provide a more symmetric stance for oblique stair descent and may reflect adaptations to reduce the risk of a misstep...|$|R
5000|$|The {{redesign}} in 1992 for 1993 featured mild restyling, flush-mounted door glass, wider doors, and slight fender flares. The 1989-style dashboard remained, but {{the seats}} and door panels were new. The 2.9-liter engine was discontinued. The engines offered were offered in displacements of 2.3, 3.0 and 4.0 liters. A new [...] "Splash" [...] model was introduced, {{which had a}} <b>flare</b> <b>side</b> bed, unique chrome wheels, 1 in lowered rear suspension and a 2 in lowered front suspension (on 4x2 models), and special vinyl [...] "Splash" [...] decals on the sides and the tailgate.|$|R
50|$|The McKenzie River dory, or drift boat, is an {{adaptation}} of the open-water dory converted for use in rivers. A variant of the boat's hull is called a modified McKenzie dory or Rogue River dory. The McKenzie designs are characterized by a wide, flat bottom, <b>flared</b> <b>sides,</b> a narrow, flat bow, and a pointed stern. The sole identifying characteristic of the McKenzie River dory is a continuous rocker (the arc from bow to stern {{along the bottom of}} the boat). It is this constant rocker that allows the boat to spin about its center for ease in maneuvering in rapids.|$|R
5000|$|The set was {{modified}} to production standards in March 1993, becoming set [...] "J1", but it {{differed from the}} production units {{in a number of}} ways. Visually, the driving cab had a different windscreen design, different headlight arrangement, and <b>flared</b> <b>side</b> panels over the front bogies. The prototype set was initially fitted with five pantographs, but this was later reduced to two in line with modifications to the production fleet. Limited water tank capacity meant that the unit was not capable of running return trips from Tokyo to Hakata, and was normally restricted to Tokyo to Osaka/Okayama/Hiroshima workings.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{noteworthy}} triple decker {{apartment houses}} built by Erick Kaller at 146 and 148 Eastern Avenue in Worcester, Massachusetts. Both {{were built in}} 1894 in a Queen Anne style, and were nearly identical, with projecting polygonal bay windows, and a single-story porch sheltering the entrance. The principal {{difference between the two}} is that 148 Eastern has <b>flared</b> <b>siding</b> skirts below its projecting bay windows. Both have lost some of their styling due to subsequent exterior alterations, including the application of modern siding. (see photos) Erick Kaller was a worker in a local wire factory, and lived at #146. Most of the tenants were Scandinavian immigrants.|$|R
5000|$|The London Underground Q Stock were trains {{used on the}} District line of the London Underground. First {{introduced}} in 1938, these electric multiple units were formed from cars built between 1923 and 1935 and new purpose-built cars, and fitted with electro-pneumatic brakes and guard controlled air-operated doors. Trains were made up from cars of different ages with differing appearances, the older ones with clerestory roofs and the newer ones with <b>flared</b> <b>sides.</b> Some units were withdrawn in the early 1960s, although six and eight-car trains remained on the District line with use gradually diminishing to peak hours only, and four car units worked the East London line, until 1971.|$|R

50|$|Accessible curb cuts {{transition}} from the low side of a curb to the high side (usually 15 cm change in level). Accessible curb ramps are a minimum of 1 metre wide. They are sloped no greater than 1:12 (8.33%), which means that for every 12 cm of horizontal distance, they rise {{no more than one}} centimetre. The concrete curb ramp is sometimes scored with grooves, the texture of which may serve as a warning to vision-impaired persons of the transition to the street. Such grooves also allow for traction and water runoff, and may be stained a color that significantly contrasts with the adjacent concrete. If a curb ramp contains <b>flared</b> <b>sides,</b> they are usually no greater than 1:10 slope.|$|R

Because of its look, limited numbers, hand-built construction, and unique pedigree, the 500 E is already considered a [...] "classic", even within Mercedes-Benz.|$|R
50|$|Edgecliff {{is located}} {{east of the}} village center of Southwest Harbor on Clark Point, a {{peninsula}} that projects into Somes Sound, the body of water that divides Mount Desert Island into two lobes. The house stands about 75 ft from the eastern shore, facing the water. It is a two story wood frame structure, rectangular in shape except for an east-facing projecting bay, and a single-story wraparound porch. The exterior is finished in wooden clapboards and shingles, with relatively plain wooden trim elements. There is a line of <b>flared</b> <b>siding</b> separating {{the first and second}} levels. The roofline is complex, punctuated with dormers, gables, and projecting bays. Portions of the building foundation have been covered in shingles, while others are covered by latticework with viny plantings growing on them. The interior is relatively simply decorated, with crown molding throughout both public and private spaces, and slightly more detailed door and window molding in the public spaces.|$|R
50|$|The 1993 Splash {{trim level}} was offered with regular cab in arctic white, gloss black, red orange, and sky blue. The Mazda B-Series became a re-badged Ranger for the 1994 model year, but the Mazda B-Series {{did not offer}} an {{equivalent}} to the Splash model. While 1993 Rangers used R-12 Freon, 1994 model year saw the transition to CFC-free air-conditioning systems {{in compliance with the}} Clean Air Act. For the 1994 model year, the Splash trim had options which all included; a 1 in lowered rear suspension and 2 in lowered front suspension (on 4x2 models), <b>flare</b> <b>side</b> bed, an extended cab, and unique chrome wheels. The decals also underwent subtle changes. While the 1993-1994 models sported red, yellow and blue stripes, the 1995 to 1996 models had lime green stripes. Additionally, the available colors for the Splash model changed from the 1993-1994 models to the 1995-1997 models. The latter were offered in maroon, gloss black, white, and canary yellow.|$|R
5000|$|The Explorer Sport Trac was {{introduced}} in February 2000 as a 2001 model. It was built on a lengthened Explorer chassis, but with a small pickup bed behind the four normal SUV doors. To {{make up for the}} short box, a bed extender was available. The bed was made entirely of a plastic composite material, and a hard plastic tonneau cover was a common factory option. The tailgate was carried over from the F-150 <b>Flare</b> <b>Side.</b> The pickup had a more rugged-appearing front end, which the 2-door Explorer Sport also received. The dash and front cabin area were nearly identical to the Ranger, while the exterior used Explorer parts. Midway through the 2001 model year, the engine design was changed. The [...] "Job 1" [...] 4.0L SOHC featured an alloy intake manifold. This was changed to a composite manifold in June 2000, and the oil filler cap moved from the driver side to the passenger side of the engine.|$|R

50|$|The {{average length}} is 16-20 millimeters, with males being smaller than females. They {{are able to}} fly, making a buzzing noise when airborne. Western conifer seed bugs are {{somewhat}} similar in appearance to the wheel bug (Arilus cristatus) and other Reduviidae (assassin bugs). These, being Cimicomorpha, are not very closely related to leaf-footed bugs as Heteroptera go; though both have a proboscis, but only the assassin bugs bite even if unprovoked, and L. occidentalis like its closest relatives can be most easily recognized by the expanded hindleg tibiae and by the alternating light and dark bands which run along the outer wing edges on the <b>flaring</b> <b>sides</b> of the abdomen. Their primary defense is to spray a bitter, offending smell, though sometimes they can smell pleasantly of apples, bananas or pine sap; however, if handled roughly they will stab with their proboscis, though they are hardly able to cause injury to humans as it is adapted only to suck plant sap and not, as in the assassin bugs, to inject poison.|$|R

40|$|Fatigue is a {{hallmark}} symptom of {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE), often associated with <b>flares,</b> <b>side</b> effects of treatment, and extensive organ damage and may {{have a significant impact}} on health-related quality of life (HrQoL). To date, the experience of fatigue in patients with SLE is underexplored. This study explored the experience of fatigue in patients with SLE and its impact on their lives through qualitative interviews. This cross-sectional qualitative study was conducted with 22 adult patients with SLE, recruited from two clinical sites in the United States. In-person semi-structured interviews were conducted and thematic analysis was performed focusing on the experience of fatigue in SLE. Results indicated that 21 out of 22 patients experienced fatigue due to SLE. Patients reported that fatigue was variable in nature in terms of both severity and frequency. Fatigue was described as having an impact on multiple aspects of a patient’s life: emotions, cognition, work, activities of daily living, leisure activities, social activities, and family activities. Understanding how patients with SLE describe the symptom of fatigue and how it impacts their lives is the key to better understanding how to measure fatigue in clinical studies eval-uating new treatments for SLE.

50|$|A frying pan, frypan, or skillet is a {{flat-bottomed}} pan {{used for}} frying, searing, and browning foods. It is typically 200 to 300 mm in diameter with relatively low <b>sides</b> that <b>flare</b> outwards, a long handle, and no lid. Larger pans {{may have a}} small grab handle opposite the main handle. A pan of similar dimensions, but with less <b>flared</b> vertical <b>sides</b> and often with a lid, is called a sauté pan. While a sauté pan can be used like a frying pan, it is designed for lower heat cooking methods, namely sautéing.|$|R
50|$|Goldstein {{also used}} {{discharge}} tubes to investigate comets.

2500|$|At the {{motorcycle}} show in November 1951, Sharp's announced what they described as [...] "a revolutionary {{design in the}} field of commercial vehicles". [...] The Sharp's Commercial 3 Cwt took the concept of the Minicar's light, three-wheeled, utilitarian design, and adapted it as the basis for an open-top lightweight industrial vehicle. The yellow and black prototype at the show was powered by an Indian Brave [...] four-stroke side valve engine (supplied by Brockhouse Engineering Co., Southport) and mounted in a cradle ahead and above the front wheel. Though described as [...] "constructed on the stressed-skin principle", large cut outs to allow easy access from either side of the vehicle required much additional strengthening to the floor, with a central steel backbone girder, a cross member between the rear wheels and further triangular bracing. The single seat was located centrally as was the steering wheel. Steering was by worm and sector, and <b>flared</b> <b>side</b> panels allowed the single front wheel to turn a full 180°, making the vehicle extremely manoeuvrable. The entire engine, drive-train and steering unit could be removed by undoing four bolts to allow for easy servicing. Unlike the Minicar, there were brakes on all three wheels and there was a wooden-slatted floor behind the driver. Though the Sharp's Commercial never entered production, it served as a forerunner to van and pickup versions of the Mark B which appeared in 1952.|$|R
