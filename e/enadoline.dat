40|$|The {{treatment}} of Parkinson's disease relies predominantly upon dopamine replacement therapy, usually with l-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA). However, side-effects of long-term treatment, such as L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias {{can be more}} debilitating than the disease itself. Non-dopaminergic treatment strategies might therefore be advantageous. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the potential anti-parkinsonian efficacy of the κ-opioid receptor agonist, <b>enadoline,</b> and the α-adrenoreceptor agonist, clonidine, both alone or in combination, in the reserpine-treated rat model of Parkinson's disease. Rats were treated with reserpine (3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1), and experiments carried out 18 [*]h later, at which time they exhibited profound akinesia (normal animals 1251 ± 228 mobile counts h− 1, reserpine-treated animals 9 ± 2 mobile counts h− 1). Both <b>enadoline</b> and clonidine increased locomotion in reserpine-treated rats in a dose-dependent manner. The maximum locomotor-stimulating effect of <b>enadoline</b> alone was seen at a dose of 0. 2 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 (208 ± 63 mobile counts h− 1). The maximum effect of clonidine was seen at a dose of 2 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 (536 ± 184 mobile counts h− 1). Co-administration of <b>enadoline</b> (0. 1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) and clonidine (0. 01 – 0. 1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) at sub-threshold doses, synergistically increased locomotion. The synergistic stimulation of locomotion in the reserpine-treated rat involved activation of κ-opioid receptors and a combination of both α 1 and α 2 -adrenoreceptors. The results presented suggest a need for further studies on the potential of stimulating κ-opioid and/or α-adrenoreceptors as a therapy for Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, the studies may offer potential mechanistic explanations of the ability of α 2 -adrenergic receptor antagonist to reduce L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease...|$|E

Although both drugs produced an immediate, mild sedation, there were no signs of head-weaving or ataxia, and there was little visual evidence of opioid-like EEG slow-wave bursts or seizures. Both drugs produced only modest increases in total EEG power that were not dose dependent. In contrast, CASA revealed significant dose-dependent frequency shifts in relative power distributions, thereby identifying distinct kappa opioid alterations in awake EEG activity; EEG power decreased in th...|$|E
40|$|D-Serine, a {{selective}} agonist for the strychnine-insensitive glycine allosteric site {{associated with the}} NMDA receptor-ion channel complex, was found to modulate differentially the antinociception produced by kappa and mu-opioid receptor agonists in the rat formalin test. D-Serine (100 micrograms, i. c. v.) attenuated the antinociception produced by the selective kappa-opioid agonist, <b>enadoline</b> (0. 003 - 0. 1 mg kg- 1, s. c.) against the tonic, but not acute, phase of the formalin response. Conversely, D-serine potentiated the antinociception produced by morphine (0. 3 - 10 mg kg- 1, s. c.) against both the acute and tonic phases.

40|$|The {{modulation}} of depolarization (4 -aminopyridine, 2 [*]mM) -evoked endogenous glutamate release by κ-opioid receptor activation and {{blockade of}} voltage-dependent Ca 2 +-channels {{has been investigated}} in synaptosomes prepared from rat and marmoset striatum. 4 -Aminopyridine (4 -AP) -stimulated, Ca 2 +-dependent glutamate release was inhibited by <b>enadoline,</b> a selective κ-opioid receptor agonist, in a concentration-dependent and nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI, selective κ-opioid receptor antagonist) -sensitive manner in rat (IC 50 = 4. 4 ± 0. 4 [*]μM) and marmoset (IC 50 = 2. 9 ± 0. 7 [*]μM) striatal synaptosomes. However, in the marmoset, {{there was a significant}} (≈ 23 %) nor-BNI-insensitive component. In rat striatal synaptosomes, the Ca 2 +-channel antagonists ω-agatoxin-IVA (P/Q-type blocker), ω-conotoxin-MVIIC (N/P/Q-type blocker) and ω-conotoxin-GVIA (N-type blocker) reduced 4 -AP-stimulated, Ca 2 +-dependent glutamate release in a concentration-dependent manner with IC 50 values of 6. 5 ± 0. 9 [*]nM, 75. 5 ± 5. 9 [*]nM and 106. 5 ± 8. 7 [*]nM, respectively. In marmoset striatal synaptosomes, 4 -AP-stimulated, Ca 2 +-dependent glutamate release was significantly inhibited by ω-agatoxin-IVA (30 [*]nM, 57. 6 ± 2. 3 %, inhibition), ω-conotoxin-MVIIC (300 [*]nM, 57. 8 ± 3. 1 %) and ω-conotoxin-GVIA (1 [*]μM, 56. 7 ± 2 %). Studies utilizing combinations of Ca 2 +-channel antagonists suggests that in the rat striatum, two relatively distinct pools of glutamate, released by activation of either P or Q-type Ca 2 +-channels, exist. In contrast, in the primate there is much overlap between the glutamate released by P and Q-type Ca 2 +-channel activation. Studies using combinations of <b>enadoline</b> and the Ca 2 +-channel antagonists suggest that enadoline-induced inhibition of glutamate release occurs primarily via reduction of Ca 2 +-influx through P-type Ca 2 +-channels in the rat but via N-type Ca 2 +-channels in the marmoset. In conclusion, the results presented suggest that there are species differences in the control of glutamate release by κ-opioid receptors and Ca 2 +-channels...|$|E
