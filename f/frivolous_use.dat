But, if it may be permitted to speak freely of those who with a feigned modesty condemn as useless what they themselves write, methinks it savours much more of vanity or insolence to publish a book for any other end; and he fails very much of that respect he owes the public, who prints, and consequently expects men should read, that wherein he intends not they should meet with anything of use to themselves or others: and should nothing else be found allowable in this Treatise, yet my design will not cease to be so; and the goodness of my intention ought to be some excuse for the worthlessness of my present.

I acknowledge the age we live in is not the least knowing, and therefore not the most easy to be satisfied. If I have not the good luck to please, yet nobody ought to be offended with me. I plainly tell all my readers, except half a dozen, this Treatise was not at first intended for them; and therefore they need not be at the trouble to be of that number. But yet if any one thinks fit to be angry and rail at it, he may do it securely, for I shall find some better way of spending my time than in such kind of conversation.

The commonwealth of learning is not at this time without master-builders, whose mighty designs, in advancing the sciences, will leave lasting monuments to the admiration of posterity: but every one must not hope to be a Boyle or a Sydenham; and in an age that produces such masters as the great Huygenius and the incomparable Mr. Newton, with some others of that strain, it is ambition enough to be employed as an under-labourer in clearing the ground a little, and removing some of the rubbish that lies in the way to knowledge;--which certainly had been very much more advanced in the world, if the endeavours of ingenious and industrious men had not been much cumbered with the learned but <b>frivolous</b> <b>use</b> of uncouth, affected, or unintelligible terms, introduced into the sciences, and there made an art of, to that degree that Philosophy, which is nothing but the true knowledge of things, was thought unfit or incapable to be brought into well-bred company and polite conversation.

To break in upon the sanctuary of vanity and ignorance will be, I suppose, some service to human understanding; though so few are apt to think they deceive or are deceived in the use of words; or that the language of the sect they are of has any faults in it which ought to be examined or corrected, that I hope I shall be pardoned if I have in the Third Book dwelt long on this subject, and endeavoured to make it so plain, that neither the inveterateness of the mischief, nor the prevalency of the fashion, shall be any excuse for those who will not take care about the meaning of their own words, and will not suffer the significancy of their expressions to be inquired into.|$|E

30|$|An ample {{literature}} {{study suggests that}} the <b>frivolous</b> <b>use</b> of CNTs as adsorbents, composites or catalysts, sensors, membranes and engineered NMs {{is the main reason}} that 6.0 and 5.5 % of CNTs leak from waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) and waste incineration plants, respectively [3].

The effects of these environmental CNTs (E-CNTs) are yet to be clear [4]. Our previous research shows how E-CNTs could be transformed [5]. CNTs can be altered to resist biodegradation, increased cellular uptake, reactivity and toxicity to terrestrial, aquatic and aerial flora and fauna. Consequently, societal perceptions may be adversely affected and there may be public pressure to ban CNTs, as they share similar pathological effects to asbestos [6]. All evidence suggests that the public are ignorant of NMs and positively disposed towards the CNT latency effects.|$|E

In this chapter, we consider how the formal leadership role, personal and community benefits, and community characteristics influence the effort members put into helping their online groups. Results from a survey of Internet listserv owners and other members suggest that though owners, who have a formal leadership role, do more of the effortful community building work than do regular members, other members also take {{on some of the}} work.

40|$|Abstract Background Uganda {{is proposing}} {{introduction}} of the National Health Insurance scheme (NHIS) in a phased manner with the view to obtaining additional funding for the health sector and promoting financial risk protection. In this paper, we have assessed the proposed NHIS from an equity perspective, exploring {{the extent to which}} NHIS would improve existing disparities in the health sector. Methods We reviewed the proposed design and other relevant documents that enhanced our understanding of contextual issues. We used the Kutzin and fair financing frameworks to critically assess the impact of NHIS on overall equity in financing in Uganda. Results The introduction of NHIS is being proposed against the backdrop of inequalities in the distribution of health system inputs between rural and urban areas, different levels of care and geographic areas. In this assessment, we find that gradual implementation of NHIS will result in low coverage initially, which might pose a challenge for effective management of the scheme. The process for accreditation of service providers during the first phase is not explicit on how it will ensure that a two-tier service provision arrangement does not emerge to cater for different types of patients. If the proposed fee-for-service mechanism of reimbursing providers is pursued, utilisation patterns will determine how resources are allocated. This implies that equity in resource allocation will be determined by the distribution of accredited providers, and checks put in place to prohibit <b>frivolous</b> <b>use.</b> The current design does not explicitly mention how these two issues will be tackled. Lastly, there is no clarity on how the NHIS will fit into, and integrate within existing financing mechanisms. Conclusion Under the current NHIS design, the initial low coverage in the first years will inhibit optimal achievement of the important equity characteristics of pooling, cross-subsidisation and financial protection. Depending on the distribution of accredited providers and utilisation patterns, the NHIS could worsen existing disparities in access to services, given the fee-for-service reimbursement mechanisms currently proposed. Lastly, if equity in financing and resource allocation are not explicit objectives of the NHIS, it might inadvertently worsen the existing disparities in service provision. </p...|$|E
40|$|Influenza {{is caused}} by {{influenza}} A virus, a single stranded RNA virus of the orthomyxoviridae family. In humans, it causes yearly outbreaks with high morbidity and excess fatality rates as a direct effect. Placed in its ecological niche however, in dabbling ducks, avian influenza virus (AIV) induce quite mild disease. It is when the virus crosses the species barrier that pathogenic traits are attributed to infection. Also infection of close relatives to dabbling ducks, the domestic chicken, cause morbidity and may in some cases change the virus into a highly pathogenic variant with nearly 100 % fatality rate. Being a very adaptable virus, these spill-over events are frequent, and numerous species are susceptible to influenza virus. When a subtype of influenza which has not previously infected humans crosses the species barrier, adapts to humans and spread easily, a pandemic event is imminent. There is no cure for influenza infection, and vaccination is a cumbersome endeavor, so currently the strategy when a pandemic strikes is damage control. In this thesis, I {{have been involved in}} a surveillance project, to increase our knowledge of how influenza travels across the globe with its natural host. We have also used animal models to investigate the pathological effects in mallard ducks and their susceptibility to re-infection. Furthermore, we have evaluated the effect and the potential risk of <b>frivolous</b> <b>use</b> of the anti-viral agent oseltamivir, and also investigated a novel approach to the classic virus isolation method of growing virus in embryonated chicken eggs (ECE s). Indication was found in northern Alaska that prevalence of influenza is probably not lower here than in other breeding areas for dabbling ducks, as has been previously suggested. As these birds travel over the Bering Strait, the reason for the genetic isolation of Eurasian and North American influenza A strains remains unclear. Inoculation of mallards equipped with subcutaneous data transmitters indicated very little effect on the host and no stress above background level, and all birds gained weight throughout the trial. Only in four of six birds (65 %) could a small temperature increase related to infection be recorded. However, more studies in a natural environment need to be conducted, to discern whether this variable is associated with an ecological cost as the captive trial ducks had access to food ad libitum. The most commonly used anti-viral drug, oseltamivir, is poorly degraded in sewage plants and surface water, where dabbling ducks forage. Extensive use of the drug thus increases environmental levels of the active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate (OC). We show that mallards inoculated with A/H 1 N 1 in an OC enriched environment generates resistant virus sporadically at OC level found today. Higher level of OC caused the resistant subspecies to dominate the virus population, which is not desirable in the influenza reservoir. An introduction of a OC-resistant pandemic virus to the human population would render the only antiviral defense toothless. Isolation of influenza virus is traditionally performed by inoculation of infectious material into embryonated chicken eggs. As the chicken host is known to induce changes in AIV, we compared isolating and passaging two viruses both in ECE s and embryonated mallard eggs. Both egg species induced mutations in the primary passage, with no furthers changes in subsequent passages. Only in ECE s did one virus maintain wild-type configuration before one mutation was observed. Mallard eggs can based on these results not be advocated as preferable to ECE s when isolating and passaging AIV...|$|E

The Lunch and Learn presented by the School of Business provided just as much food for thought. 	In the second half of the workshop, each table of 6 - 8 participants was given a sheet of paper outlining the challenges of using a virtual world like Second Life (SL) for educational purposes. After about 45 minutes of discussion time, each group reported back on their conclusions. Unfortunately, each group presented several pages of flip-chart paper worth of conclusions and we were told these findings would be made available online through the conference proceedings, but they haven’t been posted yet. 	The challenges, and some of the questions discussed, are as follows: o	learning effectiveness – Is SL a legitimate way to facilitate learning? What are the arguments for and against using it? How can learning be assessed? How do you envision using SL in your discipline? o	cost effectiveness/institutional commitment – How much will it cost me and our students? Is funding research in emerging technologies like 3 D virtual worlds a valid expense for academic institutions? What principles should institutions observe when developing policies about virtual worlds? o	access – How can SL supplement learning that requires large amounts of data? Not all students have access to SL because of technical requirements – what are some equitable ways of using SL as a meaningful yet not exclusive optional activity? o	faculty satisfaction – How should faculty respond to criticisms of colleagues that SL is <b>frivolous?</b> When students <b>use</b> new technologies and faculty resist them, how should new technologies influence instructional design? How should professional development encompass new technologies? How should governance policies reward innovative use of virtual worlds? In view of demands on faculty for teaching, research, and service, how can SL improve satisfaction? o	student satisfaction – How can SL environments be designed to be student-centered and content/experience centered rather than teacher-centered. How can learning experiences in SL respond to different generational preferences and learning styles? In view of demands on student time, how can SL improve satisfaction? 	Not all of the questions listed above were answered; however, discussion was lively and informative. My general overall impression of the workshop is that using 3 D virtual worlds is very much in its infancy – it’s a cool tool, but there isn’t a lot of knowledge of, or agreement on, exactly how it can be used for teaching and learning. My opinion is that SL is not something our learners will be asking for in the near future, but as today’s youth will become our students in 10 to 15 years, we will need to be ready to give them what they need/desire for effective online learning. Concurrent Sessions Attended: 1. 	Instructional Design Blueprint for Online Course Development 	The purpose of the session was to provide an overview of and hands-on training in the use of an instructional design blueprint for online course development. The facilitator was on instructional designer from Washington State University. He stated that good instructional design is concerned with what the learner needs to learn and how to help the learner achieve this learning. The design variables are the content, the learner, and the learning environment. The important components of his blueprint are Importance (of learning activity), Grouping (how course components are grouped), Activities (that will enhance learning), Specific Resources, Instructions, Assessment Measures, Assessment Rubric, and Authenticity (how do we know the student actually did the work?). 	One interesting tidbit I gleaned from his presentation is that his university went through five LMSs – and after each of the first three, all the courses had to be completed revised and all content moved from the old to the new LMS – he advised that course content NOT be placed right in the LMS, but rather that it reside in a different location and linked to. 2. 	Extreme Makeover: Using Learning Principles to Transform Multimedia Projects 	The purpose of the session was to examine learning principles used to design multimedia objects. The main principles are as follows: o	Students learn more deeply from words and pictures than from words alone (Mayer, 2001). o	Contiguity – text and graphics must stay together (i. e., no scrolling). o	Coherence – remove all extraneous material. o	Modality – the pathways the material travels to reach the student’s brain are crucial. For example, a multimedia learning object that comprises graphics and written words, both of which reach the student’s brain through his eyes, can create an overload of the visual processing channel; a multimedia object that has a graphic and an audio component reaches the student’s brain through both his eyes and his ears, so there is no information processing overload and learning is more effective. o	Redundancy – more is NOT better – one object that contains animation plus printed words plus audio is too much information to process, and not necessary for effective learning. o	Personalization – use of first person, informal language is more effective in multimedia learning objects than formal or third-person language. 	Besides looking at the design principles, the facilitators also presented a list of guidelines for developing a multimedia project that started with defining instructional goals and ended with evaluating the completed project for achievement of goals, learner satisfaction, and functionality. 3. 	Using a Course Template Based on the Quality Matters Rubric to Enrich Online Courses 	The purpose of the session was to introduce participants in the template used by instructional designers at Seton Hall University for building their online courses in their College of Arts and Sciences. 	The Quality Matters rubric is a subscription-only tool. 	The facilitator spent much of her time explaining why her college decided to put courses online, a topic we in the School of Business discussed ten years ago. 	We already use a template for building our online courses, and it works well for us. Since theirs is available by subscription only, she wasn’t able to actually show us how they used it. 4. 	Enhancing Teaching and Learning Using the Technologies of Generation Y Students 	The purpose of the session was for the presenter, a classroom professor, to share how he uses today’s technologies to enhance teaching and learning. 	He began by profiling the Generation Y learner: o	Born between 1978 and 1989 o	Largest consumer group in U. S. history o	Has never known life without cell phones, internet, email, chat rooms, PCs, CDs, ATMs, MTV, SUVs, etc, etc, etc o	“Let their fingers do the thinking” o	Love multi-tasking 	He concluded that “college professors must capitalize on the often used technologies of Generation Y students. ” One example of this is having students turn on their cell phones in class and using them to create a data bank which they then used to formulate statistics. He also stated that it is important to learn how to teach the different generations, because this can eliminate many major confrontations and misunderstandings. 	He also presented some basic principles of learning and explained that the teen brain learns differently than an adult brain. 5. 	Teaching the 21 st Century Learner 	The purpose of the session was to help participants under today’s new multi-tasking, visually oriented learner in order to adjust our online and blending teaching methods to better meet the needs of these new learners. 	The presenter listed the following characteristics of today’s learner: o	Craving interactivity o	Has weak reading skills o	Has strong visual/spatial skills o	Has strong parallel processing skills (multi-tasking) o	Learns by inductive discovery o	Has fast response time o	Has short attention span 	Presenter concluded that teaching these students requires much less emphasis on memorization, more emphasis on multimedia, peer-to-peer collaboration, allowing students to participate in learning process. 6. 	Promoting Active Learning in the Online Classroom through Innovative Course Design 	The purpose of the session was to present how successful course design can engage the online learner by “bringing learning material to life. ” Unfortunately, the presenter forgot her laptop, her notes, and her handouts, so she just rambled on and on with a series of anecdotal experiences she’s had in both online and classroom teaching situations. I didn’t get anything of value from her presentation other than the fact that she loves to teach. 7. 	Student Suggestions on Preventing Plagiarism 	The purpose of this session was to share some research data on student perceptions and suggestions on preventing plagiarism, as well as student feedback on the use of Turnitin. 	This session left me very confused. It seemed as if the students themselves were using Turnitin to assess their assignment, but that the results of the Turnitin assessment report were being sent to the instructors, who had no idea how to read the report and didn’t let students know the results of the reports. One of the main reasons I went to the session was to get some insight into Turnitin, and I got nothing of the kind. 	There were, however, some student suggestions that came out of the research the presenters undertook. Suggestions students made to cut down on plagiarism include: o	Educating freshman students on what plagiarism is and providing examples o	Providing students with examples of properly cited sources as well as examples of wrong citations that could result in plagiarism charges o	Encouraging student originality in assignments o	Writing unique assignments with original material o	Less research-based assignments 8. 	Applying Instructional Design Theory Elements to Design Online Environments for Adults 	According to the conference booklet, the purpose of the session was to “learn how to apply a research-based approach to designing learner-centered online learning environments for adults. ” However, the main focus of the presenter’s discussion was how to design online courses for graduate students, which is of limited use to me because my focus is on undergrads. This presentation was very heavily theory based and way over my head, so I didn’t get too much out of it. 9. 	You Only Live Twice: Making the Most of Second Life in Education 	This session was another show-and-tell about how a Multiple User Virtual Environment (MUVE) like Second Life can be used to “create powerful and psychological connection, requiring online students to work collaboratively, reflect quickly, respond intelligently, and communicate in purposeful ways to result in a deeper learning experience revolutionizing traditional and distance education. ” In my opinion, the session fell way short of its goals. I didn’t see anything that convinced me that Second Life has value as a tool for teaching university courses. I can see its potential as a marketing tool and perhaps as a socialization medium, but for me, the jury’s still out on its educational value. 10. 	Effects of Advance Organizers on Learning on Learning for Differentiated Learners in a Fully Web-based Course 	The presenter outlined the findings of her research into whether advance organizers (such as learning objectives and concept maps) helped learners in an online course. Her findings suggested that students with lower learning abilities benefited more from using an advance organizer than did students with higher learning abilities. Her study was on a small class (approx. 30) in a paced course over just an 8 -week unit of the course, so her research isn’t particularly applicable to our situation at AU. I am an Editor in the School business; instructional design and asynchronous learning processes are important aspects of my job. I plan to attend M̈aking Good Courses Better,Quality Matters Rubric to Enrich Online Courses,Diverse Online Teaching Strategies for Diverse Students,änd S̈tudent Suggestions on Preventing Plagiarismänd other similar sessions. The insights I gain from other universities will enable me to do my job better, and hopefully Iĺl be able to bring back some tips or ideas for giving our students more of what they need in an online course.
