5|$|In 1893, Rush {{moved his}} family to Sydney. The Banks Crash reduced many Australian {{businessmen}} to ruin, Rush included. His business was built on credit alone: Rush did not even own the Grafton house {{where he and his}} family lived, having mortgaged it from the man who sold it to him. He borrowed from local banks, using his store-keeping business as security. In Sydney, Rush took a lease on the York Hotel, at the corner of King and York Streets, which quickly became known as 'Mick Rush's Hotel', a popular venue <b>for</b> <b>meetings</b> of sportsmen. During the next decade, Rush kept several hotels in the city of Sydney, and operated also as a hotel broker.|$|E

In protest, the Ulster Says No movement led by Ian Paisley attracted 100,000 to a rally in Belfast, Ian Gow, later assassinated by the PIRA, resigned as Minister of State in the HM Treasury, and all 15 Unionist MPs resigned their parliamentary seats; only one was not returned in the subsequent by-elections on 23 January 1986.|$|E
5|$|The Palmach Cave {{is located}} in the {{outskirts}} of the kibbutz, near the forest. It was used by the Palmach unit of the Jewish militia during the Intercommunal conflict in Mandatory Palestine. The cave was chosen by the Palmach upon its establishment in 1941, as a training site for the Palmach's special undercover units. The cave was also used <b>for</b> <b>meetings</b> between the commanders of the Palmach. Before it was used by the Palmach it was used as a playground by the kibbutz' kids, and before that it was used as a shelter for Bedouin nomads during their voyages. Today the cave is a tourist attraction and educational site run {{by a member of the}} kibbutz.|$|E

5|$|The {{role of the}} Presidency is {{administrative}} and political. On the administrative side it is responsible for procedures and organising {{the work of the}} Council during its term. This includes summoning the Council <b>for</b> <b>meetings</b> along with directing the work of COREPER and other committees and working groups. The political element is the role of successfully dealing with issues and mediating in the Council. In particular this includes setting the agenda of the council, hence giving the Presidency substantial influence {{in the work of the}} Council during its term. The Presidency also plays a major role in representing the Council within the EU and representing the EU internationally, for example at the United Nations.|$|E
5|$|According to Morgan, {{the town}} hall was {{designed}} for multiple uses and this {{is evident from the}} plans and the exterior of the building. The largest section, the center section, serves as the government function and has municipal offices on the first floor. A stairwell to the right leads to the second floor, which functions as a town meeting room. A secondary entrance on the western facade accesses the northern section of the building, previously a library. The southern section of the building was previously a high school with separate entrances for boys and girls. The second floor of the southern section was used by the Antiquarian Society <b>for</b> <b>meetings</b> and its collections. In 1917, the original library was moved to the southern section following the completion of the Leander R. Peck School. Two additions to {{the town hall}} were made to expand the library. The two additions consisted of two parallel gable units that matched the original material and form of the town hall, the first addition was made in 1938 by Howe & Church and the second in 1963 by Michael Traficante.|$|E
5|$|On March 4, 1969 the FSU {{chapter of}} Students for a Democratic Society, an {{unregistered}} university student organization, sought to use university facilities <b>for</b> <b>meetings.</b> The FSU administration, under President Stanley Marshall, subsequently {{decided not to}} allow the SDS the use of university property and obtained a court injunction to bar the group. The result was a protest and mass arrest at bayonet point of some 58 students in an incident later called the Night of the Bayonets. The university Faculty Senate later criticized the administration's response as provoking as an artificial crisis. Another notable event occurred when FSU students massed in protest of student deaths at Kent State University causing classes to be canceled. Approximately 1000 students marched to the ROTC building where they were confronted by police armed with shotguns and carbines. Joining the all-night vigil, Governor Claude Kirk appeared unexpectedly with a wicker chair and spent hours, with little escort or fanfare, on Landis Green discussing politics with protesting students.|$|E

5|$|Roger Mowry's Tavern was {{reportedly}} {{the site of}} civil rally to free a man taken prisoner by a Massachusetts constable. The constable, whose intention was to extradite his prisoner back to Massachusetts for prosecution was staying at the nearby Roger Pray's tavern when concerned citizens gathered at Mowry's tavern. The citizens summoned the town council, and a messenger {{was sent to the}} Massachusetts constable to demand by what authority he held his prisoner. The end result was the release of the prisoner. Another story surrounding the tavern was the murder of John Clawson, a Dutch carpenter, who was found dying one December morning in 1661. A native Indian, Waumanitt, was charged with the crime and held at Mowry's tavern until the matter could be resolved, but it is unknown what fate befell Waumanitt. According to locals, Clawson was roused and accused his neighbor, Hearndon, for his murder. Clawson then cursed the family before dying. The house was also reported to have been used by the Town Council <b>for</b> <b>meetings,</b> with a record of payment in 1657 from the Town Treasurer.|$|E
5|$|The five-storey City Terminus Hotel, which fronted the station, {{was opened}} in May 1867. It was an Italianate style hotel and forecourt, {{designed}} by E. M. Barry, and it provided {{many of the}} station's passenger facilities, {{as well as an}} appropriate architectural frontispiece to the street. This arrangement was very similar to that put in place at Charing Cross. The hotel was not profitable, and was over £47,000 (now £) in debt by 1870. The City Terminus Hotel was renamed the Cannon Street Hotel in 1879. In July 1920, the hotel was the first meeting point of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Most of the hotel was closed in 1931, but the public rooms were kept open <b>for</b> <b>meetings.</b> The rest were converted into offices and renamed Southern House.|$|E
5|$|The treaty called <b>for</b> <b>meetings</b> {{between the}} {{involved}} parties {{to work out}} the exact territorial and remunerative details, to be convened at Rastatt. The French demand for more territory than originally agreed upon stalled negotiations. Despite their agreement at Campo Formio and the ongoing meetings at Rastatt, the two primary combatants of the First Coalition, France and Austria, were highly suspicious of the other's motives. Several diplomatic incidents undermined the agreement. The Austrians were reluctant to cede the designated territories and the Rastatt delegates could not, or would not, orchestrate the transfer of agreed upon territories to compensate the German princes for their losses. Ferdinand of Naples refused to pay tribute to France, followed by the Neapolitan rebellion, invasion by France, and the subsequent establishment of the Parthenopaean Republic. Republican uprising in the Swiss cantons, encouraged by the French Republic with military support, led to the establishment of the Helvetic Republic.|$|E

5|$|The treaty called <b>for</b> <b>meetings</b> {{between the}} {{involved}} parties {{to work out}} the exact territorial and remunerative details. Convened at a small town in the mid-Rhineland, Rastatt, the Congress quickly derailed in a mire of intrigue and diplomatic posturing. The French demanded more territory. The Austrians were reluctant to cede the designated territories. Compounding the Congress's problems, tensions grew between France and most of the First Coalition allies. Ferdinand of Naples refused to pay agreed-upon tribute to France, and his subjects followed this refusal with a rebellion. The French invaded Naples and established the Parthenopaean Republic. Encouraged by the French Republic, a republican uprising in the Swiss cantons led to the overthrow of the Swiss Confederation and the establishment of the Helvetic Republic. The French Directory was convinced that the Austrians were planning to start another war. Indeed, the weaker France seemed, the more seriously the Austrians, the Neapolitans, the Russians, and the English discussed this possibility. In mid-spring, the Austrians reached an agreement with Tsar Paul of Russia by which the legendary Alexander Suvorov would come out of retirement to assist Austria in Italy with another 60,000 troops.|$|E
5|$|Although Taylor {{recorded}} nine {{sacks and}} made the All-Pro team {{for the third consecutive}} season in 1983, the Giants struggled. The team went 3–12–1, and Parcells received heavy criticism from fans and the media. Taylor was forced to play inside linebacker for part of the season, a position which allowed him less pass rushing opportunities, when Carson was injured. Frustrated by the losing, Taylor began acting out by arriving late <b>for</b> <b>meetings,</b> and not participating in conditioning drills in practice. After the season, Taylor was involved in a fight for his services between the Giants and the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League. Taylor was given a $1 million interest-free, 25-year loan by Generals owner Donald Trump on December 14, 1983, with the provision that he begin playing in the USFL in 1988. Taylor regretted the decision, and less than a month later attempted to renege. His agent was able to negotiate by meeting with Trump personally and then the Giants which resulted in allowing Taylor to go with the Giants. Taylor got a 6-year $6.55-million package that also included a $1 million interest-free loan. The main results of these negotiations were threefold: 1) Taylor returned the $1 million to Trump, 2) the Giants paid Trump $750,000 over the next five seasons, and 3) the Giants gave Taylor a new six-year, $6.2-million-dollar contract.|$|E
