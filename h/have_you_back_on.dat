On [...] "My Baby's Taking Me Home" [...] off Lil' Beethoven (2002), the song title is repeated 104 times, with no other words being used, other than a spoken interlude. Similarly, on the same album, [...] "Your Call Is Very Important To Us", uses a corporation style call-hold message: [...] "Your call is very important to us. Please hold" [...] which is then sung with some additional words: [...] "At first she said your call is very important to us, then she said please, please hold." [...] The only other lyrics in the song are [...] "Red light", [...] "Green light", [...] "I'm Getting Mixed Signals" [...] and [...] "Sorry, I'm Going To <b>Have</b> To Put <b>You</b> <b>Back</b> <b>On</b> Hold". These elements are layered with a simple piano line to create a highly textured effect.|$|R
