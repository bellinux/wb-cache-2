5|$|If {{appropriate}} {{electrical contacts}} {{are attached to}} a nanotube, electron-hole pairs (excitons) can be generated by injecting electrons and holes from the contacts. Subsequent exciton recombination results in electroluminescence (EL). <b>Electroluminescent</b> devices have been produced from single nanotubes and their macroscopic assemblies. Recombination appears to proceed via triplet-triplet annihilation giving distinct peaks corresponding to E11 and E22 transitions.|$|E
5|$|Indium(III) oxide and indium {{tin oxide}} (ITO) are used as a {{transparent}} conductive coating on glass substrates in <b>electroluminescent</b> panels. Indium tin oxide {{is used as a}} light filter in low-pressure sodium-vapor lamps. The infrared radiation is reflected back into the lamp, which increases the temperature within the tube and improves the performance of the lamp.|$|E

25|$|A {{light-emitting}} capacitor is {{made from}} a dielectric that uses phosphorescence to produce light. If one of the conductive plates is made with a transparent material, the light is visible. Light-emitting capacitors {{are used in the}} construction of <b>electroluminescent</b> panels, for applications such as backlighting for laptop computers. In this case, the entire panel is a capacitor used for the purpose of generating light.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{technologies}} used for variable-gain amplification, each having different advantages and disadvantages. Vacuum tubes are used in a configuration called variable-mu where the grid-to-cathode voltage changes to alter the gain. Optical compressors use a photoresistor and a small lamp (Incandescent, LED or <b>electroluminescent</b> panel) to create changes in signal gain. Other technologies used include field effect transistors and a diode bridge.|$|E
25|$|All second-generation IS models {{offered a}} more typical Lexus {{interior}} {{compared to the}} previous generation {{with a focus on}} luxurious accouterments. The interior featured memory leather seats, lightsaber-like <b>electroluminescent</b> instrument display lighting and LED interior lighting accents, the choice of faux-metallic or optional Bird's Eye Maple wood trim (aluminum composite on the IS F), and SmartAccess keyless entry with push-button start. Options ranged from touchscreen navigation with backup camera to a Mark Levinson premium sound system and Dynamic Radar Cruise Control.|$|E
25|$|An organic {{light-emitting}} diode (OLED) is a {{light-emitting diode}} (LED) {{in which the}} emissive <b>electroluminescent</b> layer is a film of organic compound that emits light {{in response to an}} electric current. This layer of organic semiconductor is situated between two electrodes; typically, {{at least one of these}} electrodes is transparent. OLEDs are used to create digital displays in devices such as television screens, computer monitors, portable systems such as mobile phones, handheld game consoles and PDAs. A major area of research is the development of white OLED devices for use in solid-state lighting applications.|$|E
25|$|Indium's uses can {{be divided}} into four categories: the largest part (70%) of the {{production}} is used for coatings, usually combined as indium tin oxide (ITO); a smaller portion (12%) goes into alloys and solders; a similar amount is used in electrical components and in semiconductors; and the final 6% goes to minor applications. Among the items in which indium may be found are platings, bearings, display devices, heat reflectors, phosphors, and nuclear control rods. Indium tin oxide has found a wide range of applications, including glass coatings, solar panels, streetlights, electrophosetic displays (EPDs), <b>electroluminescent</b> displays (ELDs), plasma display panels (PDPs), electrochemic displays (ECs), field emission displays (FEDs), sodium lamps, windshield glass and cathode ray tubes, making it the single most important indium compound.|$|E
25|$|Bicycles and {{tricycles}} {{are popular}} for getting {{around on the}} dry lake. Mountain bikes are generally preferred over road bikes for riding on the dried silt, which is normally hard but becomes loose with traffic. Participants often decorate their bikes to make them unique. Since lighting on the bikes is critically important for safety at night, many participants incorporate the lighting into their decorations, using <b>electroluminescent</b> wire (a thin, flexible tube that glows with a neon-like effect when energized with electricity) to create intricate patterns over {{the frame of the}} bike. Every night during Burning Man, thousands of bikes and art cars drive around, creating a visual display similar to Las Vegas at night, except that the lights are mobile.|$|E
25|$|Pope's group {{reported}} in 1965 {{that in the}} absence of an external electric field, the electroluminescence in anthracene crystals is caused by the recombination of a thermalized electron and hole, and that the conducting level of anthracene is higher in energy than the exciton energy level. Also in 1965, W. Helfrich and W. G. Schneider of the National Research Council in Canada produced double injection recombination electroluminescence for the first time in an anthracene single crystal using hole and electron injecting electrodes, the forerunner of modern double-injection devices. In the same year, Dow Chemical researchers patented a method of preparing <b>electroluminescent</b> cells using high-voltage (500–1500 V) AC-driven (100–3000Hz) electrically insulated one millimetre thin layers of a melted phosphor consisting of ground anthracene powder, tetracene, and graphite powder. Their proposed mechanism involved electronic excitation at the contacts between the graphite particles and the anthracene molecules.|$|E
500|$|Disney was {{involved}} with the Ice Hotel in Jukkasjärvi, Sweden through association with designers Ian Douglas-Jones at I-N-D-J and Ben Rousseau to create [...] "The Legacy of the River", a high-tech suite inspired by Tron: Legacy. The suite uses <b>electroluminescent</b> wire to capture the art style of the film. It consists of over 60 square meters of 100mm thick ice equating to approximately six tons. 160 linear meters of <b>electroluminescent</b> wire were routed out, sandwiched and then glued with powdered snow and water to create complex geometric forms. The Ice Hotel is expected to get 60,000 visitors for the season which lasts December 2010 through April 2011. On November 19, 2010, the Tron: Legacy Pop Up Shop opened at Royal-T Cafe and Art Space in Culver City, California. The shop featured many of the collaborative products created as tie ins with the film from brands such as Oakley, Hurley and Adidas. The space was decorated in theme and the adjacent cafe had a tie in menu with Tron inspired dishes. The shop remained open until December 23, 2010.|$|E
500|$|Vehicle cabins have {{incorporated}} <b>electroluminescent</b> Optitron gauges, [...] SmartAccess, a smart key entry and startup system, and multimedia features. Beginning with the 2010 RX and HS models, the Remote Touch system, featuring a computer mouse-like controller with haptic feedback, was introduced; other models have featured touchscreen controls (through the 2009 model year) as a navigation screen interface. 2014 saw {{the introduction of}} the next version of Lexus’ remote-touch innovations—the Remote Touch Interface Touchpad in the new RC Coupe.|$|E
500|$|The skintight suits worn by {{the actors}} were {{reminiscent}} of the outfits {{worn by the}} actors in the original film. Kosinski believed that the costumes {{could be made to}} be practical due to the computerized nature of the film, as physically illuminating each costume would be costly to the budget. Christine Bieselin Clark worked with Michael Wilkinson in designing the lighted costumes, which used <b>electroluminescent</b> lamps derived from a flexible polymer film and featured hexagonal patterns. The lights passed through the suit via Light Tape, a substance composed of Honeywell lamination and Sylvania phosphors. To concoct a color, a transparent 3M Vinyl film was applied onto the phosphor prior to lamination. While most of the suits were made out of foam latex, others derived from spandex, which was sprayed with balloon rubber, ultimately giving the illusion of a lean shape. The actors had to be compressed to compensate for the bulk of the electronics. In addition, Clark and Wilkinson designed over 140 background costumes. The two sought influence from various fashion and shoe designers in building the costumes. On the back of the suit was an illuminated disc, which consisted of 134 LED lights. It was attached to the suit via a magnet, and was radio-controlled. All the costumes had to be sewn {{in such a way that}} the stitches did not appear, as the design team figured that in a virtual environment the clothes would just materialize, with no need for buttons, zippers or enclosures. According to Neville Page, the lead designer for the helmets, [...] "The art departments communicated very well with each other to realise Joe’s [...] vision. We would look over each other’s shoulders to find inspiration from one another. The development of the costumes came from trying to develop the form language which came from within the film." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{visual effects}} were {{cited as the}} central {{highlight}} of the film. In his three-star review, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt that the environment was aesthetically pleasing, and added that its score displayed an [...] "electronic force" [...] that complemented the visuals. Rolling Stone columnist Peter Travers echoed these sentiments, concluding that the effects were of an [...] "award-caliber". J. Hoberman of The Village Voice noted that while it was extensively enhanced, Tron: Legacy retained the streamlined visuals that were seen in its predecessor, while Variety Peter DeBarge affirmed that the visuals and the accompanied [...] "cutting-edge" [...] score made for a [...] "stunning virtual ride". To Nick de Semlyen of Empire, [...] "This is a movie of astonishing high-end gloss, fused to a pounding Daft Punk soundtrack, populated with sleek sirens and chiselled hunks, boasting <b>electroluminescent</b> landscapes to make Blu-ray players weep." [...] Some critics were not as impressed with the film's special effects. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times avouched that despite its occasional notability, the film's [...] "vibrating kaleidoscopic colors that gave the first movie its visual punch {{have been replaced by}} a monotonous palette of glassy black and blue and sunbursts of orange and yellow". Though declaring that Tron: Legacy was [...] "eye-popping", San Francisco Chronicle Amy Biancolli asserted that the special effects were [...] "spectacular"—albeit cheesy. A columnist for The Wall Street Journal, Joe Morgenstern denounced the producers' emphasis on technological advancements, which he felt could have been used for other means such as drama. To the New York Post Kyle Smith, there were many moments where he [...] "shed [...] customary phlegmatic equilibrium and [...] thought: Hey, this is really exciting!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Polymer {{light-emitting}} diodes (PLED, P-OLED), also light-emitting polymers (LEP), involve an <b>electroluminescent</b> conductive polymer that emits light when connected to an external voltage.

2500|$|Inside, {{numerous}} [...] "downscalings" [...] were evident. [...] A conventional fixed {{rear seat}} replaced the folding bucket seat design. The conventional trunk area included a vinyl mat, {{rather than the}} previous model's carpeted cargo area. The center console in the front remained, {{but there was no}} center armrest. The tachometer was now optional instead of standard and the <b>electroluminescent</b> gauges disappeared in favor of a conventional design.|$|E
2500|$|The numerals were {{displayed}} via green high-voltage <b>electroluminescent</b> [...] seven-segment displays.

It had a [...] Inside, <b>electroluminescent</b> Optitron gauges were offered for the first time, along with an upgraded stereo system. For export markets, the {{second generation}} GS began production in the JZS161 body style on 4 August 1997 and was officially launched in late 1997.|$|E
2500|$|The Ninety-Eight was restyled for 1980, {{along with}} the Delta 88. That year, it gained a new 307 cid (5.0 L) V8 as an option. The 403 was dropped completely. The 1980 models {{received}} new exterior sheet metal, without drastically changing {{the look of the}} car. To improve aerodynamics and fuel economy the hood was sloped downward, while the trunk area was higher. This also gave all models a heavier, more substantial appearance, while even slightly increasing interior and trunk space. 1981 saw the introduction of Buick's 252in³ V6 as standard, as well as a new 4-speed THM200-4R automatic transmission. The gas 350 engine was dropped that same year, completely replaced by the smaller 307. The new Regency Brougham model was introduced for 1982. This car featured plush [...] "Prima" [...] velour seats with embroidered emblems, cut pile carpeting, and <b>electroluminescent</b> opera lamps on the B-pillars. [...] Regency became the new 'base' model as the LS was discontinued. A redesigned steering wheel and slightly revised instrument panel were also new that year. The 1983 models received a new grille, but were otherwise unchanged. The federal [...] impact standard was rolled back for 1984, prompting GM to make major changes to the bumpers to save weight; predictably, this drastically reduced their effectiveness. An optional 8-track tape player and the 4.1 L V6 were no longer available, though the CB radio was still optional.|$|E
