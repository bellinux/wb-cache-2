Wisconsin put some more points on the board late {{in the third quarter}} with a 27-yard field goal by Kyle French. On the first play of the fourth quarter, RB Corey Clement scored on a 5-yard touchdown run.

25|$|As {{a direct}} result of the Russo-Japanese War (1904/05), Japanese {{influence}} replaced Russia's in Inner Manchuria. During the war with Russia, Japan had mobilized one million soldiers to fight in Manchuria, meaning that one out of every eight families in Japan had a member fighting the war. During the Russian-Japanese war, the losses were heavy with Japan losing half-million men dead or wounded, making Manchuria into a sacred land for the Japanese people, a place hallowed with the blood of so many Japanese soldiers. From time of the Russian-Japanese war onward, many Japanese people came to have a proprietary attitude to Manchuria, taking the viewpoint that a land where so much Japanese blood had been lost in some way now belonged to them. In 1906, Japan laid the South Manchurian Railway to Port Arthur (Japanese: Ryojun). Under the terms of the Treaty of Portsmouth, the Kwantung Army had the right to occupy southern Manchuria while the region fell into the Japanese economic sphere of influence. The Japanese owned South Manchurian Railroad company had a market capitalization of 200 million yen, making it into Asia's largest corporation, which went beyond <b>just</b> <b>running</b> the former Russian railroad network in southern Manchuria to owning the ports, mines, hotels, telephone lines, and sundry other businesses, dominating the economy of Manchuria. With the growth of the South Manchuria Railroad company went growth in number of Japanese living in Manchuria from 16, 612 Japanese civilians in 1906 to 233,749 in 1930. The majority of the blue collar employees for the Mantetsu were Chinese, and the Japanese employees were mostly white collar, meaning the most of the Japanese living in Manchuria were middle-class people who saw themselves as an elite. Between World War I and World War II Manchuria became a political and military battleground between Russia, Japan, and China. Japan moved into Outer Manchuria as a result of the chaos following the Russian Revolution of 1917. A combination of Soviet military successes and American economic pressure forced the Japanese to withdraw from the area, however, and Outer Manchuria returned to Soviet control by 1925.|$|E

500|$|Hard Candy {{received}} generally favorable reviews. The album {{received a}} score of 65/100 on Metacritic, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Mark Savage from the BBC commented on {{the composition of the}} tracks, saying [...] "if a handful of the tracks had been delivered to more producers with a touch more subtlety, Hard Candy could have ranked alongside Madonna's best. [...] Over and over again, she subsumes her pop sensibilities to their arsenal of clattering beats, hollered raps and over-fussy production." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic felt that [...] "There's a palpable sense of disinterest , as if she just handed the reins over to Pharrell and Timba-Lake, trusting them to polish up this piece of stale candy. Maybe she's not into the music, maybe she's <b>just</b> <b>running</b> out this last album for Warner before she moves onto the greener pastures of Live Nation—either way, Hard Candy is as a rare thing: a lifeless Madonna album." ...|$|E

500|$|The next concept, Dark Camelot, still {{focused on}} sword combat. Its plot—an {{inversion}} of Arthurian legend—featured Mordred as a misunderstood hero, King Arthur as a tyrannical villain and Merlin as a psychopath. According to Church, the game featured Morgan le Fay as Mordred's [...] "sort of good" [...] advisor and Guinevere as a lesbian who would betray Lancelot and help Mordred {{to break into}} Camelot and steal the Holy Grail. The game's design combined a first-person perspective with action, role-playing and adventure elements. Warren Spector, who had recently left Origin Systems to found Looking Glass Studios Austin, became Dark Camelots producer after his predecessor departed. Artist Dan Thron said: [...] "For a good long time, {{we had no idea}} what the game was about, until somebody stumbled upon the whole thief game play where you're not <b>just</b> <b>running</b> out trying to chop people up."

500|$|Since 1983, Shearer {{has been}} {{the host of the}} public radio comedy/music program Le Show. The program is a hodgepodge of satirical news commentary, music, and sketch comedy that takes aim at the [...] "mega morons of the mighty media". It is carried on many National Public Radio and other public radio {{stations}} throughout the United States. Since the merger of SIRIUS and XM satellite radio services the program is no longer available on either. The show has also been made available as a podcast on iTunes and by WWNO. On the weekly program Shearer alternates between DJing, reading and commenting on {{the news of the day}} after the manner of Mort Sahl, and performing original (mostly political) comedy sketches and songs. In 2008, Shearer released a music CD called Songs of the Bushmen, consisting of his satirical numbers about former President George W. Bush on Le Show. Shearer says he criticizes both Republicans and Democrats equally, and also says that [...] "the iron law of doing comedy about politics is you make fun of whoever is running the place" [...] and that [...] "everyone else is <b>just</b> <b>running</b> around talking. They are the ones who are actually doing something, changing people's lives for better or for worse. Other people the media calls 'satirists' don't work that way." ...|$|E
