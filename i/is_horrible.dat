25|$|Radio 816 / Lisbon 14-Dec.1961: You {{understand}} the bitterness with which I send you this message. It <b>is</b> <b>horrible</b> {{to think that}} this may mean total sacrifice, but I believe that sacrifice is the only way for us to keep up to the highest traditions and provide service {{to the future of the}} Nation. Do not expect the possibility of truce or of Portuguese prisoners, as there will be no surrender rendered because I feel that our soldiers and sailors can be either victorious or dead. These words could, by their seriousness, be directed only to a soldier of higher duties fully prepared to fulfill them. God will not allow you to be the last Governor of the State of India.|$|E

500|$|Back at the Krusty Krab, Plankton {{comes in}} and disagrees with Mr. Krabs' story and tells SpongeBob his own version. His story {{is the same as}} Mr. Krab's, except that their roles during the fight at the end are reversed, with Krabs wanting to rule the money of the {{children}} and when they disagreed shot Plankton out of a straw into the dump. Plankton and Krabs begin arguing about the story, until Karen arrives and tells the real story. In the story, the restaurant initially has no customers, and Old Man Jenkins, an elderly resident and an old friend of Krab's family, is the first to try their burger, but collapses, having been poisoned by the patty. Krabs and Plankton become angry and accuse each other of tainting the patty. They begin fighting over the recipe, eventually tearing it in two. Their friendship over, Plankton storms out to pursue his own career in food. However, during the struggle, a shelf was knocked down, dumping various ingredients into the patty batter, creating the Krabby Patty recipe, which Krabs is left with. The two go their separate ways, each trying to open their own establishment. Mr. Krabs' [...] "Krabby Patty" [...] became a success, while Plankton's Chum Burger <b>is</b> <b>horrible.</b>|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the Munich appointment Solti gained a recording contract in 1946. He signed for Decca Records, not as a conductor but as a piano accompanist. He made his first recording in 1947, playing Brahms's First Violin Sonata with the violinist Georg Kulenkampff. He was insistent {{that he wanted to}} conduct, and Decca gave him his first recording sessions as a conductor later in the same year, with the Zurich Tonhalle Orchestra in Beethoven's Egmont overture. Twenty years later Solti said, [...] "I'm sure it's a terrible record, because the orchestra was not very good at that time and I was so excited. It <b>is</b> <b>horrible,</b> surely horrible– but by now it has vanished." [...] He had to wait two years for his next recording as a conductor. It was in London, Haydn's Drum Roll symphony, in sessions produced by John Culshaw, with whose career Solti's became closely linked over the next two decades. Reviewing the record, The Gramophone said, [...] "The performance of the London Philharmonic Orchestra under Georg Solti (a fine conductor who is new to me) is remarkable for rhythmic playing, richness of tone, and clarity of execution." [...] The Record Guide compared it favourably with EMI's rival recording by Sir Thomas Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic.|$|E
500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club {{was more}} {{critical}} of the episode, {{and gave it a}} D. He called the visual effects [...] "hilariously bad," [...] likening the CGI to [...] "a '90s computer game." [...] Sava added, [...] "As mediocre as the series has been, it was on a bit of an upswing with the last few episodes, but 'True North' is a big step backwards... The problem isn’t that these kids can’t act (although that might be the problem), it’s that the writing for their characters <b>is</b> <b>horrible...</b> This week’s episode is straight-up children’s television, and not in the way that it can be enjoyed by all ages. You need to be a child to suspend your disbelief long enough to watch 'True North.'" [...] Despite the critique, Sava did enjoy Caulfield's scenes, as well as Emma and Mary Margaret's conversation concerning motherhood. Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Gwen Orel opined that the Hansel and Gretel [...] "parallel is clear and rather sweet, with touches of the ongoing story of Emma and Snow White, too." [...] Orel felt the episode seemed [...] "like a demented episode of Chopped," [...] and called the gingerbread house [...] "just like it should , colorful and candylike." ...|$|E
500|$|Playwright Alan Bennett was {{particularly}} repulsed by Witchfinder. In his regular column in The Listener, published eight {{days after the}} film's release, Bennett explained how he felt horror films should always be [...] "punctuated by belly laughs" [...] and attacked Reeves's completely humourless movie as [...] "the most persistently sadistic and morally rotten film I have seen. It was a degrading experience by which I mean {{it made me feel}} dirty." [...] Although Reeves was infuriated, his response indicated that he believed Bennett's reaction was proof that his decision to include such extreme violence was the correct approach to the material. In his letter published in The Listener, Reeves noted: [...] "Surely the most immoral thing in any form of entertainment is the conditioning of the audience to accept and enjoy violence... Violence <b>is</b> <b>horrible,</b> degrading and sordid. Insofar as one is going to show it on the screen at all, it should be presented as such– and the more people it shocks into sickened recognition of these facts the better. I wish I could have witnessed Mr. Bennett frantically attempting to wash away the 'dirty' feeling my film gave him. It would have been proof of the fact that Witchfinder General works as intended." ...|$|E

2500|$|I was {{absolutely}} gobsmacked. I said, “This <b>is</b> <b>horrible.</b> Horrible!” And it’s a very slow, sinking feeling when you’re watching the movie, {{and the first}} scene comes out, and you’re like, “Oh, that’s a really bad scene.” But you say, “Well, that’s okay, the next one’ll be better.” And you somehow try to convince yourself that it’s going to get better… and it just gets worse. And I was like, “Wow. That was crazy.” I mean, I really didn’t see that coming. So at that point, I distanced myself from the movie. Now, of course, it has a whole other life {{as a sort of}} inadvertent… satire. No, “satire” isn’t the right word. But it’s inadvertently funny. So it’s found its place. It provides entertainment, though not in the way I think it was originally intended. It was just… maybe the wrong material with the wrong director and the wrong cast.Showgirls was universally derided by film critics. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a rating of 19% based on 48 reviews with the consensus; [...] "Vile, contemptible, garish, and misogynistic -- and that might just be exactly Showgirls' point." [...] Metacritic give the film an average score of 16/100, indicating [...] "Overwhelming dislike. Roger Ebert, following a relatively mild negative review (2 stars out of 4), wrote that Showgirls received [...] "some bad reviews, but it wasn't completely terrible". The film remains heralded as one of cinema's worst.|$|E
