5|$|During the Cold War, new U.S. Air Force bases were {{constructed}} {{along the northern}} border of the continental U.S.; their most direct route to the Soviet Union was through the Arctic Circle. These sites were high-importance strategic bases for hosting long-range missiles and aircraft. In 1947, the New England Division of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers chose a site in northeastern Maine, within both the Limestone Township and Caswell Plantation. The remote site consisted mostly of dense forest, shallow marshes, and wild blueberry bogs, on a slight plateau over the town, which helped keep it above the fog most of the time. Only {{a small part of}} the base was suitable for farming, so there was little impact on Aroostook County's agricultural community. Additionally, Loring was not far from sources of materials for runway, taxiway, and parking apron construction. The most important benefit of the site was that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred miles closer than any other base to potential targets in Europe.|$|E

25|$|The {{cause of}} the {{explosion}} is controversial, and still much disputed to this day. Although the {{cause of the}} explosion is the subject of debate, it is commonly believed to have been caused by the air burst of a large meteoroid or comet fragment at an altitude of 510kilometres (36miles) above the Earth's surface. Different studies have yielded varying estimates of the object's size, with general agreement that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> tens of metres across.|$|E

25|$|On 15 July 2009 at 18:03:10 EDT, {{the launch}} was finally successful. Upon {{reviewing}} the launch video footage, imagery analysts noted {{eight or nine}} instances of foam shedding from the External Tank. The pictures of the external tank taken when jettisoning showed loss of foam in the intertank ribbing. The chairman of the Mission Management Team was not concerned and felt that the Space Shuttle would be cleared for re-entry on its return voyage—which <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days later.|$|E
500|$|Other {{industries}} {{developed in}} South Bend {{in the early}} 20th century, including Birdsell Manufacturing Company, the Bendix Corporation, Honeywell, AlliedSignal, South Bend Lathe Works, the O'Brien Paint Corp., the South Bend Toy Company, South Bend Range, South Bend Bait Company, and South Bend Watch Company. Workers at the Bendix Corporation actually staged the first sit-in strike in American history in 1936. [...] Fast development {{led to the creation}} of electric rail transportation throughout the area and, in 1925, the South Shore interurban streetcar service was established from downtown South Bend to downtown Chicago. South Bend was the first community in the United States to have an electrified trolley system (even though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years before it was usable and profitable).|$|E
500|$|The Digital Fixs Ryan Poxon gave CRUSH3D a {{score of}} seven out of ten and called it a [...] "puzzle game that {{genuinely}} surprised me at how brain teasing the game actually is." [...] 411Mania's Adam Larck gave it {{a score of}} 6.6 out of 10 and said, [...] "For a puzzle game, Crush 3D {{is a good choice}} for 3DS fans. While the mechanic may not be as creative as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years ago, it’s still a decent game to check out. If you never saw the PSP version or haven’t played games like Fez or Echochrome, I’d recommend checking this out to see what crushing is all about." [...] However, Digital Spys Liam Neeson gave it three stars out of five and stated: [...] "Despite the five-year gap between releases, Crush 3D takes a few steps backwards in terms of visual style and presentation. Other than a rather limited and lacklustre selection of new levels and StreetPass features, it also offers very {{little in the way of}} brand new bonus content, making it difficult to recommend to anybody familiar with its PSP counterpart. Despite its shortcomings, however, Crush 3D gets it right where it counts." [...] In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of three sevens and one six for a total of 27 out of 40.|$|E

[...] This was funded by participating companies and was entitled [...] "Additional Entertainments", since the name [...] "Fringe" [...] was still not yet in regular usage. It also used a strange cover motif.|$|E
2500|$|The English poet Rudyard Kipling wrote [...] "The White Man's Burden" [...] to Americans, {{calling on}} them to take up {{their share of the}} burden. Subtitled [...] "The United States and the Philippine Islands", it was a widely noted {{expression}} of imperialist sentiments, which were common at the time. The nascent revolutionary government desirous of independence, however, resisted the United States in the Philippine–American War in 1899; it won no support from any government anywhere and collapsed when its leader was captured. William Jennings Bryan denounced the war and any form of overseas expansion, writing, Destiny' is not as manifest as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks ago." ...|$|E

Unfortunately, as it only [...] "saved" [...] the universe {{a few seconds before}} its end, only one tiny part of the house remained, containing only a few people.

2500|$|The Irene {{was then}} burning well so {{additional}} vessels were sent for. Most of the Irenes 258 passengers were saved though fourteen were never seen again. All the survivors were taken {{on board the}} submarines and later transferred to the Admiralty S Class destroyer HMS Stormcloud, the cruiser [...] and the minesweeper HMS Magnolia, which also assisted in putting out the fire on the ship. The British {{put out the fire}} but because they had sprayed so much water into the vessel she eventually capsized and sank the following day. Several men received decorations for their conduct in rescuing survivors, including Lieutenant Halahan who received the Distinguished Service Cross. The Hong Kong police managed to filter out several of the pirates who tried to blend in with their hostages during the rescue and seven more were taken by the L5. Jones said that they found the pirates naked in a lifeboat and crying so they were assumed to be civilians and taken aboard in blankets. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days later when the crew of L5 were informed that the seven men they picked up were responsible for the hijacking.|$|E
