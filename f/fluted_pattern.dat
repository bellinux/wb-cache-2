5000|$|The {{corrugated}} medium is often [...] basis {{weight in the}} U.S.; in the UK, a [...] fluting paper is common. At the single-facer, it is heated, moistened, and formed into a <b>fluted</b> <b>pattern</b> on geared wheels. This is joined to a flat linerboard with a starch based adhesive to form single face board. At the double-backer, a second flat linerboard is adhered {{to the other side}} of the fluted medium to form single wall corrugated board. Linerboards are test liners (recycled paper) or kraft paperboard (of various grades). The liner may be bleached white, mottled white, colored, or preprinted.|$|E
50|$|Although it had {{declined}} {{along with other}} dry and mesic forest plants, many large trees could still be found until the 1970s. At that point, {{the arrival of the}} black twig borer, (Xylosandrus compactus) caused a catastrophic collapse of the species. Today, populations only exist in the northwestern part of Kauai, the Waianae Range on Oahu, the southwestern slopes of Haleakalā on Maui, and the Big Island's Kona coast. Nearly all living individuals exist as basal shoots from older trees where the main trunk has died, or are outplanted saplings. Because of the extreme durability of the wood and its easily recognized <b>fluted</b> <b>pattern,</b> many dead trunks can still be found.|$|E
40|$|An elecrostatic finite-sized {{particle}} {{simulation model}} {{is used to}} study the early time-scale phenomena asociated with an impulsively injected plasma, expanding radially, normal to a strong ambient magnetic field. Results of the simulation show the early formation of a radial polarization electric field due to ion-electron charge separation which causes electrons to drift in the azimuthal direction. Velocity shear within this motion {{gives rise to a}} Kelvin-Helmholtz (dioxotron) instability, creating a radial <b>fluted</b> <b>pattern</b> as the plasma expands. In the nonlinear stage of instability, azimuthal variations in the electric field are observed which cause electrons to drift across the magnetic field, thereby reducing the space charge created by energetic ion expansion. The results of a linear stability analysis reveal that for a decreasing amount of charge separation in the plasma, the number of unstable azimuthal modes at maximum growth rate increases. Also, as the thickness of the electron ring increases, a fewer number of unstable modes develops for a given amount of charge separation. It is concluded that electrons become unstable at the very early time scale, within an ion gyroperiod, and that unstable electrons lead to modification of the ion dynamics...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} method of extracting scallop areas from gravel seabed images to assess fish resources, and {{developed}} an automatic system that measures their quantities, sizes, and states. Scallops feature different colors, <b>fluted</b> <b>patterns</b> and forms. The present study is described our method of extracting these features, and presented the results and its effectiveness. ...|$|R
2500|$|There is a {{matching}} pair of smaller flanged bowls, (diameter 168mm): they are intricately decorated with beading, foliate scrolls and small birds and hares on the rims, and have rosettes in {{relief in the}} centre base. [...] The main bodies of these little bowls have a delicate <b>fluted</b> internal <b>pattern.</b>|$|R
50|$|The ironsmelting furnace {{associated}} to these Urewe ceramics comprised a basin filled with fresh green leafy branches and herbs {{which served as}} a filter for the slag deposit at the base. Above the basin was a cone-shaped shaft, not unlike a chimney, made by superimposing rolls of damp clay. The decorated furnace, with its <b>fluted</b> <b>patterns</b> on the upper roll and deeply incised criss-cross or s-shaped patterns on the outer surface, may be reminiscent of the rim or neck of the ceramic pottery. Analyses carried out on the ironworking residue have not yet provided data on the efficiency of these furnaces, or whether they were a measure of their technical nature. Iron ore and fuel were readily available. The word “ubutare” meaning “iron” still crops up in many place names. The wooded crown cover was used to produce charcoal. As new wood was always used for this purpose, radiocarbon dating of this material is relatively reliable.|$|R
2500|$|The {{entrance}} {{facade of}} the Cave 19 worship hall is ornate. Two round pillars with <b>fluted</b> floral <b>patterns</b> and carved garlands support a porch. Its capital is an inverted lotus connecting to an amalaka. To its left is standing Buddha in varada hasta mudra with a devotee prostrating at his feet. On right is a relief of woman with one hand holding a pitcher and other touching her chin. Above is a seated Buddha in meditating mudra. Towards {{the right of the}} entrance is the [...] "Mother and Child" [...] sculpture. A figure with begging bowl is the Buddha, watching him are his wife and son.|$|R
