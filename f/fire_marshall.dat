Under a new law, the California <b>Fire</b> <b>Marshall</b> will be required to review the oil pipelines conditions every year while federal regulations only mandate a review every five years. Another new law provides for making oil spill response times faster and more effective. Finally, a new law will force intrastate pipelines to use the best-known technology such as automatic shut-off valves.|$|E

25|$|But as Brooklyn Police <b>Fire</b> <b>Marshall</b> Patrick Keady noted {{later in}} his Special Report, instead of the orderly {{procession}} that had originally informed Jackson's evacuation estimates, everyone attempted to sally the stairs at once. Anything but orderly, people jammed {{in the doorway and}} stumbled under the relentless press from people behind them. Their feet got caught in balustrades; they tripped and fell.|$|E
25|$|The case took an {{unexpected}} turn when the {{investigation by the}} State <b>Fire</b> <b>Marshall,</b> Police and District Attorney changed its focus from Sweetland to Richard Webb. Webb hired a prominent legal team which included Henry S. Breckinridge.

Fortunately, Vine was now nearer the Washington Street entrance, where Cain and his fellow police officers were slowly reinstating some kind of rough order. He was able to gain the lobby and helped clear the crush around the stairs. He left the theatre, carrying {{a woman who had}} been trampled underneath and “who seemed as dead as a door nail”. <b>Fire</b> <b>Marshall</b> Keady felt that Vine had been the last person to leave the family circle alive. When he had jumped, there were still many people frantically struggling to leave.|$|E

25|$|Some {{people in}} the dress circle, {{familiar}} with the theatre, tried to avail themselves of the other exit leading into Flood's Alley, near the corner of Johnson Street. Patrons in the first rush down the stairs found the door locked; no usher was in sight. In the brief time it took them {{to discover that the}} door was locked and return to the dress circle, the stage had become engulfed and they had no recourse but to attempt to work their way down the main dress circle stairs to the lobby, adding their numbers to the crush on those stairs. <b>Fire</b> <b>Marshall</b> Keady would later write that he never found evidence that the exit had been opened.|$|E

2500|$|In 2000, Nelson {{announced}} that he would be running for the United States Senate seat held by retiring Republican Connie Mack III. effective January 3, 2001. Florida's [...] "resign-to-run" [...] law requires an incumbent office holder seeking another elective office to submit an irrevocable resignation from the office they currently hold unless that tenure would end anyway before they would assume the new position if elected. The candidate may designate the effective date of the resignation to be in the future, but it must be no later than the date that they would assume the new office. This compelled Nelson to submit his resignation as Treasurer, Insurance Commissioner and <b>Fire</b> <b>Marshall</b> early in 2000 when he began to campaign for the U.S. Senate seat. He chose January 3, 2001 as the effective date of his resignation, as that was the date new Senators would be sworn in.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, {{the state}} of Connecticut enacted {{legislation}} preventing physical restraint or seclusion of special needs students except in limited situations, {{largely as a result}} of allegations of mistreatment of four special education students in Wilton High School and other Wilton schools in 2005. Jill Ely claimed that, without notifying her, the school forced her intellectually disabled son into a room at the high school that was held shut until he became completely quiet. She said that her son injured his arm trying to get out and once, she later learned, [...] "he was left crying and whimpering for almost the entire day." [...] An investigation by the Wilton Bulletin in 2006 found that the high school [...] "safe room" [...] had never been inspected by the <b>fire</b> <b>marshall</b> and lacked a Building Department certificate of occupancy. Maryanne Lombardi made similar claims that her 9-year old autistic son, who did not speak, was routinely sent to a [...] "padded cell called the timeout room" [...] at another Wilton school. Gloria Bass, the grandmother of two special needs students, also said that one child had been restrained for months in a storage closet without her knowledge. Superintendent Gary Richards defended the schools’ actions saying, [...] "We do the best we can with kids who sometimes are very challenged." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the tour}} in 1993, Flea was {{diagnosed}} with chronic fatigue syndrome and was ordered to rest for a year. Flea and Kiedis felt it best to <b>fire</b> <b>Marshall</b> {{due to lack of}} chemistry and briefly replaced him with Jesse Tobias although his tenure was very short and he was quickly replaced by Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro, who was once recruited in 1992 to replace Frusciante. The band was ready now to record their next album although Kiedis {{was in the middle of}} a heroin relapse, which forced Flea to assume the role of lyricist, something he had not yet done. He wrote most of the song [...] "Transcending", and the intro to [...] "Deep Kick". Flea also wrote the lyrics to an entire song; [...] "Pea", in which he both played bass and sang. These three songs appeared on the Chili Peppers' sixth record One Hot Minute, which was released on 12 September 1995. The album received mixed reviews and was significantly less commercially successful than Blood Sugar Sex Magik. The One Hot Minute Tour was ultimately cut short due to various injuries Kiedis and Smith received, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers decided to go on hiatus. Flea was so miserable that at one point during the tour discussed quitting the band. Flea began to practice Transcendental Meditation and yoga, and slowly decreased his marijuana consumption. Due to the Chili Peppers' inactivity, Flea joined Navarro in a Jane's Addiction reunion tour in 1997, filling in for ex-Jane's Addiction bassist Eric Avery. Rumors spread, that the band was breaking up until Navarro stated otherwise: [...] "I want to clarify that the Chili Peppers are not breaking up... Flea and I are more than happy to do both projects, time permitting." ...|$|E

The Roughriders <b>fired</b> <b>Marshall</b> after a 1-7 start and had Miller step in as his replacement. The season was plagued by errors and mishaps, most of them self-inflicted as the team could not dig itself out of their early season hole. 2011 proved to be Ken Miller's last season with the Roughriders, as he retired shortly after the 2011 season.|$|R
