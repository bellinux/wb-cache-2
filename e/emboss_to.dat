50|$|Stamped {{concrete}} is concrete that is patterned and/or textured or <b>embossed</b> <b>to</b> resemble brick, slate, flagstone, stone, tile, wood, {{and various}} other patterns and textures. Stamped concrete is commonly used for patios, sidewalks, driveways, pool decks, and interior flooring. The ability of stamped concrete to resemble other building materials makes stamped concrete a less expensive alternative to using those other authentic materials such as stone, slate or brick.|$|R

50|$|The former Ninth Street ("Singing") Bridge was a {{primitive}} affair built rather {{low over the}} river, and whose creosote-treated wooden deck was fitted with strips of metal plates spaced a tire-track apart to prevent excessive wear.

40|$|Polymer {{crystallization}} {{is notoriously}} difficult to control. Here, we {{demonstrate that the}} orientation of polymer crystals can be fully controlled at the nanoscale by using nanoimprint lithography (NIL) with molds bearing nanotrenches to shape thin films of poly(vinylidene fluoride). This unprecedented control {{is due to the}} thermomechanical history experienced by the polymer during <b>embossing,</b> <b>to</b> the shift of the nucleation mechanism from heterogeneous to homogeneous in confined regions of the mold, and to the constraining of the fast growth axis along the direction of the trenches. NIL thus appears as an ideal tool to realize smart polymer surfaces where crystal ordering can be tuned locally...|$|R
