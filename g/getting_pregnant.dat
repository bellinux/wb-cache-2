25|$|However, {{there is}} a lack of good quality {{research}} on the risks and benefits of selective reduction procedures. Many parents often find the suggestion of selective termination upsetting particularly if the pregnancy is a result of IVF or they have had difficulty <b>getting</b> <b>pregnant</b> in the past. Background, religious or personal beliefs can all play a part in effecting whether parents want to go through with the procedure and could be the reason why research in this area is scarce.|$|E
25|$|As an endocrinologist, Elders was {{especially}} concerned with young diabetic women <b>getting</b> <b>pregnant.</b> If young teen {{women who have}} diabetes get pregnant, they have a high chance of their bodies rejecting the fetus or the fetus developing abnormalities in utero. To prevent these pregnancies from happening, she thoroughly talked to her patients {{about the dangers of}} early pregnancy and the importance of using contraceptives, and taking control of their sexuality as soon as they began puberty. Of the approximately 260 young diabetic women she treated, only one of them became pregnant.|$|E

25|$|For visceral {{leishmaniasis}} in India, South America, and the Mediterranean, liposomal amphotericin B is the recommended treatment {{and is often}} used as a single dose. Rates of cure with a single dose of amphotericin have been reported as 95%. In India, almost all infections are resistant to pentavalent antimonials. In Africa, a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin is recommended. These, however, can have significant side effects. Miltefosine, an oral medication, is effective against both visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. Side effects are generally mild, though it can cause birth defects if taken within 3 months of <b>getting</b> <b>pregnant.</b> It {{does not appear to}} work for L. major or L. braziliensis.|$|E

When she looks inside, she sees baby pictures of her and Charlie, which resemble their children. Peggy sees how much he loves her and how much she loves him, and they kiss. They begin to make love, which would again lead to Peggy <b>getting</b> <b>pregnant</b> and marrying him. In the next moment, Peggy is transported back to 1985.|$|E
25|$|Untreated TB in {{pregnancy}} {{is associated with}} an increased risk of miscarriage and major fetal abnormality, and treatment of pregnant women. The US guidelines recommend omitting PZA when treating TB {{in pregnancy}}; the UK and WHO guidelines make no such recommendation, and PZA is commonly used in pregnancy. There is extensive experience with the treatment of pregnant women with TB and no toxic effect of PZA in pregnancy has ever been found. High doses of RMP (much higher than used in humans) causes neural tube defects in animals, but no such effect has ever been found in humans. There may be an increased risk of hepatitis in pregnancy and during the puerperium. It is prudent to advise all women of child-bearing age to avoid <b>getting</b> <b>pregnant</b> until TB treatment is completed.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of {{families}} at risk for X-linked diseases, patients are provided with a single PGD assay of gender identification. Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases {{who are in the}} process of <b>getting</b> <b>pregnant.</b> The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases. Such X-linked Mendelian diseases include Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), and hemophilia A and B, which are rarely seen in females because the offspring is unlikely to inherit two copies of the recessive allele. Since two copies of the mutant X allele are required for the disease to be passed on to the female offspring, females will at worst be carriers for the disease but may not necessarily have a dominant gene for the disease. Males on the other hand only require one copy of the mutant X allele for the disease to occur in one's phenotype and therefore, the male offspring of a carrier mother has a 50% chance of having the disease. Reasons may include the rarity of the condition or because affected males are reproductively disadvantaged. Therefore, medical uses of PGD for selection of a female offspring to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive disorders are often applied. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection can be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are significantly more prevalent in one sex. Three assessments are made prior to the initiation of the PGD process for the prevention of these inherited disorders. In order to validate the use of PGD, gender selection is based on the seriousness of the inherited condition, the risk ratio in either sex, or the options for disease treatment.|$|E

500|$|Fey {{and former}} SNL castmate Amy Poehler {{starred in the}} 2008 comedy Baby Mama. The movie was written and {{directed}} by Michael McCullers. The plot concerns Kate (Fey), a business woman, who wants a child but, discovering she has only a million-to-one chance of <b>getting</b> <b>pregnant,</b> decides to find a surrogate: Angie (Poehler), a white-trash schemer. Baby Mama received mixed reviews, but critics enjoyed Fey's performance. Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote: [...] "Fey is a delight to watch throughout. Able to convey Kate's intentions and feelings through the simple looks and inflections, she never melodramatizes her situation; nor does her efficient, perfectionist side become overbearing." [...] The movie grossed over US$64million at the box office.|$|E

In desperation, Catherine tried every known trick for <b>getting</b> <b>pregnant,</b> such as placing cow dung and ground stags' antlers on her [...] "source of life", and drinking mule's urine.
