40|$|Graduation date: 1978 This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the coefficient of <b>drag</b> <b>resistance</b> (µ) between a log and bare forest soil during partial suspension yarding. <b>Drag</b> <b>resistance</b> in this study was defined as the resistance due to friction between the soil and the log plus the resistance due to the plowing action of the log in the soil. The coefficient of <b>drag</b> <b>resistance</b> is the ratio of the <b>drag</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>forces</b> parallel to the ground and the normal support force between the log and the ground. Data were collected on four test plots on Paul Dunn and McDonald State Forests located {{in the foothills of the}} Coast Range in Oregon. A photographic technique was developed to measure the value of the <b>drag</b> <b>resistance</b> coefficient during yarding. This method used angles measured from a photograph of a yarded log and the logs dimensions to ca 1 cu 1 ate µ. The method is based on the equilibrium of the forces on the log at the instant the photographic sample was taken. Data were taken to determine both the static and dynamic <b>drag</b> <b>resistance</b> coefficient for uphill yarding of young growth Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) logs. Regression equations were developed to predict the static µ as a function of log geometry, ground slope, soil texture, soil moisture, and soil density. These equations suggest that soil moisture and ground slope are the most significant variables in explaining µ, with log geometry, soil texture and soil density playing a less important role. The equations developed were verified using a chi-square test for goodness-of-fit to compare predicted and observed values of µ on additional data. Analysis of the data collected for the dynamic <b>drag</b> <b>resistance</b> coefficient revealed that the assumptions of the measurement method were violated so no regression equations were developed. Suggestions were given on the conditions required for the method to work. A load factor was developed which indicates the increase in log load capacity for a skyline logging system when dragging rather than flying a log load. The calculations for the load factor were based on the results of the study...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Conventional {{approaches}} to vehicle traction and propulsion analysis have used spread-sheets or numerical integrations {{owing to the}} diculty in deriving closed-form solutions. This is inconvenient if a parameter is to be varied, and {{it is even more}} dicult when multiple parameters of a complex model are evaluated at the design phase. In this paper, it is intended to formulate two non-linear dierential equations representing road load and power consumption. By expanding inertia <b>force,</b> air <b>drag,</b> rolling <b>resistance,</b> gravitational <b>force</b> and tyre tractive force, the equations can be simplied as functions of velocity v, i. e. s 1 vb=s 2 s 3 v 2 and mvb=(r 1 v 3 r 2 v+r 3) /v respectively. With these two equations, engineers can use either numerical or analytical methods to study key parameters at the design phase. To demonstrate the eectiveness of these equations, Wright State’s electric car model is used. The results for front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive and four-wheel drive cases are presented...|$|R

For short distance (neighbourhood) person transport in cultural, historical and natural heritage location such as places of tourist interest electrically driven vehicles, equipped with advanced energy storage and management devices could be used. The achievement of higher efficiency of energy conversion and energy exchange between different kinds of secondary energy sources is a very important way of hybrid and electric propulsion systems development. Each vehicle in order to move must produce tractive power on its wheels to counteract against the aerodynamic <b>drag</b> <b>force,</b> rolling <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> and gravity forces during ascent. Moreover, during accelerating the vehicle must overcome inertia forces. Most of energy delivered to the system during accelerating is consequently lost irrecoverably during braking. Wherever the tractive power is produced by electric machines (in cases of FC vehicles, HEVs as well as EV), energy losses during braking can be reduced due to effective regeneration. Capabilities of secondary energy sources to store energy depend on important vehicle parameters: maximum range, grade ability and acceleration ability. These parameters affect life cycles of traditional secondary energy sources (electrochemical batteries). Use of UCAP’s enables improvement of battery life cycle and simultaneously a decrease in electric (EV) or hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) exploitation costs. The stack of UCAP’...|$|R

40|$|A {{dynamically}} embedded {{plate anchor}} (DEPLA) is a rocket-shaped anchor that comprises a removable central shaft {{and a set}} of four flukes. The DEPLA penetrates to a target depth in the seabed by the kinetic energy obtained through free-fall in water. After embedment the central shaft is retrieved leaving the anchor flukes vertically embedded in the seabed. The flukes constitute the load-bearing element as a plate anchor. This paper focuses on the dynamic installation of the DEPLA. Net resistance and velocity profiles are derived from acceleration data measured by an inertial measurement unit during DEPLA field tests, which are compared with corresponding theoretical profiles based on strain rate–enhanced shear resistance and fluid mechanics <b>drag</b> <b>resistance.</b> Comparison of the measured net <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> profiles with the model predictions shows fair agreement at 1 : 12 scale and good agreement at 1 : 7. 2 and 1 : 4. 5 scales.

40|$|The magnetical field tuned superconductor-insulator {{transition}} in amorphous thin films, e. g., Ta and InO, exhibits {{a range of}} yet unexplained curious phenomena, such as a putative low-resistance metallic phase intervening the superconducting and the insulating phase, and a huge peak in the magnetoresistance at large magnetic field. Qualitatively, the phenomena can be explained equally well within several significantly different pictures, particularly the condensation of quantum vortex liquid, and the percolation of superconducting islands embedded in normal region. Recently, we proposed and analyzed a distinct measurement in Y. Zou, G. Refael, and J. Yoon, Phys. Rev.

40|$|The present paper investigates {{use of the}} {{surrogate}} {{models for}} the multi-objective shape optimization of vehicles. The objectives of interest {{are related to the}} aerodynamic performance of vehicles such as air <b>resistance</b> (<b>drag),</b> lift <b>force,</b> moments, aeroacoustic properties or soiling and accumulation of water. The suggested technique is tested here on a two-dimensional vehicle geometry with four design variables and two objective functions. Faced centered composite design is used to define the data points in the design space that will be used for the computer experiments (CFD) with a steady solver and standard k-epsilon turbulence model. The second order polynomial response surface model is then constructed from the computer calculated responses from CFD. Search for the optimal design is done using the epsilon-constraint method. In order to investigate the correlation between the two objectives (the drag and the lift) the Pareto-optimal solutions were computed. Hierarchical cluster algorithm is finally used to analyze the Pareto optimal solutions and to draw conclusions about the design. Finally some improvements of the technique that are required {{in order to make the}} suggested technique to become an engineering tool are discussed...|$|R
30|$|The {{speed of}} {{traditional}} trains is limited {{because of the}} dynamic friction between {{the wheels of the}} train and the fixed rail on the ground. When the trains are running at a low speed, most of the energy is consumed by friction. The trains can be levitated above the rail to avoid such friction with the technology of magnetic levitation [1]. There are three types of levitation technologies: electromagnetic suspension (EMS), electrodynamic suspension (EDS), hybrid electromagnetic suspension (HEMS) [2]. Even with these three methods, the velocity of trains could not be improved remarkably because of the aerodynamic drag. When the trains run at low speeds, this drag is not evident. At high speeds, however, the aerodynamic drag is too large to be neglected. Whatever the trains are levitated or not, the aerodynamic drag is the dominate part of drag when it runs at a high speed in the atmosphere near the earth’s surface. At a speed range between 400 and 500  km/h, the aerodynamic drag accounts for 80  %– 90  % of the total drag including the aerodynamic <b>drag,</b> the eddy <b>resistance</b> <b>force,</b> and the braking force [3]. The train speed is much lower than the airplane speed because airplanes flight in a circumstance of rarefied gas in the high altitude. In view of this fact, the evacuated tube transportation (ETT) was proposed to reduce the aerodynamic drag and improve the speed of the maglev train. Shen [4] and Yan [5] discussed the possibility, strategy, and the technical proposal for developing the ETT in China.|$|R

The effects of the release time on the liquid pool volume and radius are investigated for the continuous release.

When the tyre pressure changed, it had a direct effect on rolling <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> of the vehicle and reduced the tractive force. Moreover, it {{had an effect on}} a rate of fuel consumption and driving comfort. This research had tested the effect of tyre pressure of 25 psi and 45 psi to determine the total <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> between the vehicle speed from 40 km/hr to 100 km/hr and compare with the reference tyre pressure of 35 psi by using the “coast-down technique”.

The different <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> from tyre pressure of 35 psi with the other 2 values of tyre pressure in the research were called the different rolling <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> because the vehicle changed only tyre pressure which had no effect on aerodynamics drag. The relationship of the different rolling <b>resistance</b> <b>force</b> along the test speed from tyre pressure of 25 psi and 45 psi decreased while the vehicle speed increased.
