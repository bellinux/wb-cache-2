Commercial octaBDE is highly persistent in the environment, whose only degradation pathway is through debromination {{and the production}} of bromodiphenyl ethers, which can increase toxicity.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTwo {{kinds of}} BFRs in three WEEE plastics(cell phone shells, {{computer}} housings and TV housings) and PCBs were detected with GC/MS. The results showed the plastics used as mobile phone shells had no BFRs. TBBPA was only found in computer housings. Among PBDEs, congeners of heptabromodiphenyl ether, octabromodiphenyl ether and nonabromodiphenyl ether were frequent ones, and detected in both TV housings and computer housings. But {{the contents of}} N 9 BDE were lower than the other two, only 180 mg/kg and 5. 3 mg/kg in computer housings and TV housings respectively, while pentabromodiphenyl ether and <b>hexabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> were determined in PCBs...|$|E
30|$|Industrial {{chemicals}} like {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} [PCBs], perfluorinated compounds [PFCs], and polybrominated diphenyl ethers [PBDEs] {{have been used}} in innumerable applications for many years. In recent years, however, it became clear that these compounds are by no means unproblematic when reaching the environment. Many of them are highly persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic. Furthermore, the substances themselves or their precursors are subject to long-range transport and have been detected in biota in remote areas like the Arctic and Antarctica (e.g., [1 – 16]). These findings led to the inclusion of PCBs, certain PBDEs (i.e., <b>hexabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ether,</b> heptabromodiphenyl ether, tetrabromodiphenyl ether, and pentabromo-diphenyl ether), as well as the PFCs' perfluorooctane sulfonic acid [PFOS] and its salts and perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride into the list of persistent organic pollutants [POPs] covered by the Stockholm Convention on POPs [17, 18]. Already 9 years earlier, in 2000, a voluntary phase-out of PFOS was initiated by its main producer 3 M. Others, like perfluorooctanoic acid [PFOA] are still under evaluation. In the European Union [EU], PCBs and technical Penta- and Octa-BDEs were banned already in 1985 and 2004, respectively [19, 20]. An EU-wide restriction of Deca-BDE followed in 2008 (curia.europa.eu; case C- 14 / 06).|$|E
30|$|PBDEs are {{extensively}} used {{in various}} types of electronic equipment, furniture, plastics, textiles, etc. due to their excellent flame retardant performance (Leonel et al. 2014). Since PBDEs can be easily incorporated into different materials and products without making any covalent bonds, they could transport and migrate to different environment through volatilization and effusion etc. (Kim et al. 2007). Therefore, PBDEs have become widespread environmental pollutants and are ubiquitous in the environment (Birgul et al. 2012). Due to their persistency, long-range environmental transport potential and bioaccumulation ability, four PBDE congeners (i.e. tetrabromodiphenyl ether, pentabromodiphenyl ether, <b>hexabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> and heptabromodiphenyl ether) have been listed as new persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in 2009 (Stockholm Convention 2009). Previous studies demonstrated that PBDEs have {{a wide range of}} toxicities, including cytotoxicity (An et al. 2011), developmental neurotoxicity (Costa et al. 2014), genotoxicity (Ji et al. 2011), disruption of thyroid functions (Xu et al. 2014), reproductive toxicity (Muirhead et al. 2006) and carcinogenicity (Zhao et al. 2015). Penta-BDEs are reported to be the most toxic compounds among the PBDEs congeners. Deca-BDEs received the least concern among PBDEs congeners on account of its relatively lower toxicity (Gandhi et al. 2011). However, the higher-brominated PBDEs congeners (hepta-BDEs to deca-BDEs) could be degraded/transformed to lower-brominated PBDEs congeners which seems to be more toxic in various environments such as soil, aquatic ecosystems (Huang et al. 2014). Therefore, PBDEs had posed a great threat to both human health and the global environment.|$|E
40|$|Persistent organic {{pollutants}} and epidemic of diabetes and metabolic syndrome Dear fellow diabetes investigators, you, myself and our Editor-in-Chief, Dr Hotta, {{have the same}} goal; {{to do something about}} the epidemic of diabetes in Asia. I will not show the numbers again, as you have seen enough; simply there are too many peo-ple around us with diabetes. Why there are so many? Professor Eung-Jin Kim, Honorary President of Korean Diabetes Association, told me that diabetes was a rare disease in early 1960 s. He saw only five cases of dia-betes the whole year in 1957 at Seoul National University Hos-pital, which had 450 beds back then. It is clear that the diabetes epidemic in Korea (and elsewhere) is due to a change of the environment. Huge changes have occurred over the last half century in South Korea. She has industrialized, westernized and became wealthier. I do not believe industrialization is bad for South Koreans, as they live much longer now. Was the diabetes epidemic an inevitable consequence of these changes associated with industrialization? If it was, it might have been avoided. Something bad was introduced during the industri-alization process; so-called persistent {{organic pollutants}} (POP). Recently, evidence supporting this conclusion has been forth-coming and is getting stronger. Persistent organic pollutants are defined as ‘chemical substances that persist in the environment, bio-accumulate through the food web, and pose a risk of causing adverse effects to human health and the environment’. The Stockholm Convention on POP, an organization formed by international treaty, identified 12 POP initially and then added nine POP later. Here is the list: pesticides (aldrin, chlordane, DDT, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, hexachlorobenzene, mirex, toxaphene, chlordecone, alpha hexachlorocyclohexane, beta hexa-chlorocyclohexane, lindane and pentachlorobenzene), industrial chemicals (hexachlorobenzene, polychlorinated biphenyls [PCB]; hexabromobiphenyl; <b>hexabromodiphenyl</b> <b>ether</b> and heptabro-modiphenyl ether; pentachlorobenzene; perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, its salts and perfluorooctane sulfonyl fluoride; tetrabromodi-phenyl ether and pentabromodiphenyl ether) and by-products (hexachlorobenzene; polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans [PCDD ⁄PCDF], PCB, alpha hexa-chlorocyclohexane, beta hexachlorocyclohexane and pentachloro...|$|E
