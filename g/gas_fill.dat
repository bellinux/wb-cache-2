25|$|In some circumstances, {{fluorescent}} lamps operated {{at the power}} supply frequency (50 or 60Hz) can also produce flicker at the same frequency itself, which is noticeable by more people. This can happen {{in the last few}} hours of tube life when the cathode emission coating at one end has almost run out or a filament is open circuit, and that cathode starts having difficulty emitting enough electrons into the <b>gas</b> <b>fill,</b> resulting in slight rectification and hence uneven light output in positive and negative going AC cycles. Power frequency flicker can also sometimes be emitted from the very ends of the tubes, if each tube electrode produces a slightly different light output pattern on each half-cycle. Flicker at power frequency is more noticeable in the peripheral vision than it is when viewed directly, as is all flicker (since the peripheral vision is faster—has a higher critical frequency—than the central vision).|$|E

This article analyzes the pressure dependence of gas diffusion coefficient in core and cladding holes of HC-PCF under the same condition of temperature and pressure during filling of methane and acetylene gas. An analytical model has been proposed to study the gas flow {{dynamics in}} core and cladding of HC-PCF.

40|$|AbstractThe {{transition}} from a liquid to a <b>gas</b> <b>filled</b> tubular network is the prerequisite for normal function of vertebrate lungs and invertebrate tracheal systems. However, the mechanisms underlying the process of <b>gas</b> <b>filling</b> remain obscure. Here we show that waterproof, encoding a fatty acyl-CoA reductase (FAR), {{is essential for the}} <b>gas</b> <b>filling</b> of the tracheal tubes during Drosophila embryogenesis, and does not affect branch network formation or key tracheal maturation processes. However, electron microscopic analysis reveals that in waterproof mutant embryos the formation of the outermost tracheal cuticle sublayer, the envelope, is disrupted and the hydrophobic tracheal coating is damaged. Genetic and gain-of-function experiments indicate a non-cell-autonomous waterproof function for the beginning of the tracheal <b>gas</b> <b>filling</b> process. Interestingly, Waterproof reduces very long chain fatty acids of 24 and 26 carbon atoms to fatty alcohols. Thus, we propose that Waterproof {{plays a key role in}} tracheal <b>gas</b> <b>filling</b> by providing very long chain fatty alcohols that serve as potential substrates for wax ester synthesis or related hydrophobic substances that ultimately coat the inner lining of the trachea. The hydrophobicity in turn reduces the tensile strength of the liquid inside the trachea, leading to the formation of a gas bubble, the focal point for subsequent <b>gas</b> <b>filling.</b> Waterproof represents the first enzyme described to date that is necessary for tracheal <b>gas</b> <b>filling</b> without affecting branch morphology.

40|$|Previously superhydrophobic {{surfaces}} {{have demonstrated}} effective drag reduction by trapping a lubricious gas layer {{on the surface}} with micron-sized hydrophobic features.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is used to measure the capacitance of the surface which is shown to be proportional to the solid/liquid interface area. To maintain a full gas coverage for prolonged periods the surface is held at an electrical potential which leads to hydrogen evolution. In the desired <b>gas</b> <b>filled</b> state the water does not touch the metallic area of the surface, however after gas has dissolved the water touches the metal which closes the electrochemical circuit causing hydrogen to be produced replenishing the gas in the surface and returning to the <b>gas</b> <b>filled</b> state; in this way the system is self-actuating.

Gas filling devices were composed of fast connector, gas pipe, barometer and air valve, by which the gaps could be repeatedly charged and deflated from a hole {{at the center of}} anode. Working life is lengthened by exchanging gas, and operating voltage range is widened by changing gas pressure in a certain range.
