5|$|In March 1951 secret United States <b>intercepts</b> of {{diplomatic}} dispatches disclosed clandestine conversations in which General MacArthur expressed confidence to the Tokyo embassies of Spain and Portugal {{that he would}} succeed in expanding the Korean War into a full-scale conflict with the Chinese Communists. When the <b>intercepts</b> {{came to the attention}} of President Truman, he was enraged to learn that MacArthur was not only trying to increase public support for his position on conducting the war, but had secretly informed foreign governments that he planned to initiate actions that were counter to United States policy. The President was unable to act immediately since he could not afford to reveal the existence of the <b>intercepts</b> and because of MacArthur's popularity with the public and political support in Congress. However, following the release on April 5 by Representative Martin of MacArthur's letter, Truman concluded he could relieve MacArthur of his commands without incurring unacceptable political damage.|$|E
50|$|<b>Intercept</b> 1.0 was {{released}} in 1996. In 1998 the product line was expanded to include <b>Intercept</b> Relay for beta testers, <b>Intercept</b> SDK for integrations, and <b>Intercept</b> Web for Web Access. One of the distinguishing features of early versions of <b>Intercept</b> was its integration to Microsoft Visual SourceSafe.|$|R
50|$|For this {{operation}} Army Group B, which {{had left the}} Euskirchen Fixed <b>Intercept</b> Station in northern France to <b>intercept</b> the United Kingdoms traffic, was assigned the 56th <b>Intercept</b> Company of Army Group A, which has been stationed near Le Cateau-Cambrésis. Army Group A was assigned the 18th <b>Intercept</b> Company, the third {{to be released from}} the East. Thus, each army group again had two motorized <b>intercept</b> companies at its disposal: Army Group B having the 26th and 56th <b>Intercept</b> Companies; Army Group A having the 3rd and 18th <b>Intercept</b> Companies; and Army Group C having the 9th and 57th <b>Intercept</b> Companies.|$|R
5000|$|Principle Department III: <b>Intercept.</b> Commanded by Senior Specialist Breuer. The {{department}} {{was responsible for}} <b>intercept,</b> including the actual <b>intercept</b> stations and initial sorting of <b>intercepted</b> messages. It consisted of over 200 personnel and two sections.|$|R
5|$|Orto Ignatiussen (voice) as Aningaaq, a Greenlandic Inuit {{fisherman}} who <b>intercepts</b> one of Stone's transmissions. Aningaaq {{also appears}} in a self-titled short, {{written and directed by}} Gravity co-writer Jonás Cuarón, which depicts the conversation between him and Stone from his perspective.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} listed {{buildings}} reflecting {{the history of}} the village. The River Chew flows through the village. Just outside the village is Chew Magna Reservoir: this small Bristol Water supply reservoir <b>intercepts</b> the Winford Brook.|$|E
5|$|After running 50,000 {{simulated}} <b>intercepts</b> on analog computers, Bell {{returned a}} final {{report on the}} concept in October 1956, indicating that the system was within {{the state of the}} art. A 13 November 1956 memo gave new names to the entire Nike series; the original Nike became Nike Ajax, Nike B became Nike Hercules, and Nike II became Nike Zeus.|$|E
50|$|For operations, the HQ of <b>intercept</b> {{troops with}} each army group was {{assigned}} one evaluation centre (NAAS) and two <b>intercept</b> companies; the fixed <b>intercept</b> station at Euskirchen had been temporarily motorized as an <b>intercept</b> company. The Münster and Stuttgart fixed <b>intercept</b> stations continued to co-operate with the commanders of <b>intercept</b> troops (the Münster station with Army Group B, and the Stuttgart station with Army Group C). It {{was intended to}} move them forward as soon as possible.|$|R
50|$|Assignment of <b>intercept</b> {{coverage}} from 1923 to 1933 {{was made by}} the Code and Ciphers of the Defense Ministry (Reichwehrministerium Chiffrierabteilung). The division of <b>intercept</b> tasks was established on a geographical basis. The Munich outstation <b>intercepted</b> traffic from Italy, which included the Italian colonies, Yugoslavia, Romania, Hungary, Austria, and Czechoslovakia. The Stuttgart outstation monitored France, including her colonies, Belgium, the Netherlands and Spain. Münster <b>intercept</b> outstation monitored England including colonies and Dominions. The <b>intercept</b> station at Königsberg <b>intercepted</b> Russian traffic. The Breslau <b>intercept</b> station monitored communications traffic from Polish, Czechoslovakian and Russia. The Liegnitz had twice the personnel of the stations.|$|R

5|$|CAP {{performs}} several {{missions that}} are not combat-related {{in support of the}} United States Air Force, including damage assessment, transportation of officials, communications support and low-altitude route surveys. The CAP fleet is used in training exercises to prepare USAF pilots to intercept enemy aircraft over the Continental United States. Civil Air Patrol aircraft are flown into restricted airspace, where United States Air Force pilots may practice high-speed <b>intercepts.</b>|$|E
5|$|Church and Trench arrive, {{freeing the}} miners and the team, {{and join the}} Expendables to pursue Vilain. The group <b>intercepts</b> Vilain and his men at an airport {{as he prepares to}} leave by plane. Joined again by Booker, the Expendables, Trench and Church engage the Sangs in battle. Christmas decapitates Hector, while Ross and Vilain fight hand-to-hand. Ross defeats Vilain, {{stabbing}} him and avenging Billy.|$|E
5|$|Low-altitude <b>intercepts</b> {{would also}} have the {{advantage}} of reducing the problem with nuclear blackout. The lower edge of an extended fireball used to induce nuclear blackout extended down to about 60km, the same as the altitude at which decluttering became effective. Hence, low-altitude <b>intercepts</b> meant that deliberate attempts to create a blackout would not affect the operation of the Sprint missile. Just as importantly, because the Sprint's own warheads would be going off far below this altitude, their fireballs would be much smaller and only black out {{a small portion of the}} sky. The radar would have to survive the electrical effects of EMP, and significant effort was expended on this. It also meant that the threat tube trajectories would have to be developed rapidly, before or between blackout periods. This demanded a very high-performance computer, one that did not exist at that time.|$|E
5000|$|By {{comparing}} {{the result of}} online IP checkers when accessed using https vs http, as most <b>intercepting</b> proxies do not <b>intercept</b> SSL. If there is suspicion of SSL being <b>intercepted,</b> one can examine the certificate associated with any secure web site, the root certificate should indicate whether it was issued {{for the purpose of}} <b>intercepting.</b>|$|R
50|$|The types/ranges are strategic, {{theater and}} tactical. Each entails unique {{requirements}} for <b>intercept,</b> and a defensive system capable of <b>intercepting</b> one missile type frequently cannot <b>intercept</b> others. However, there is sometimes overlap in capability.|$|R
50|$|A Commander of <b>Intercept</b> Troops East (Kommandeur der Horchtruppern Ost) {{was left}} in {{occupied}} Poland to continue monitoring the Soviet Union from the <b>intercept</b> posts in Königsberg/Cranz and Striegau with the 3rd/7 and 3rd/18 <b>intercept</b> companies.|$|R
5|$|The Take Ichi convoy sailed from Shanghai {{bound for}} Manila on 17 April, and {{initially}} comprised 15 transports and the 6th Escort Convoy Command. Seven of the transports were traveling to Manila only and the 32nd and 35th Divisions were each carried by four vessels. Allied code breakers decrypted radio signals {{relating to the}} convoy's departure and subsequent <b>intercepts</b> allowed radio traffic analysts to follow its progress south.|$|E
5|$|The <b>intercepts</b> even {{included}} {{an order from}} Trotsky to the revolutionary council of war of the Western Front, confirming Tukhachevsky's operational orders, thus giving them {{the authority of the}} supreme chief of the Soviet armed forces. An entire operational order from Tukhachevsky to Budionny was intercepted on 19 August and read on 20 August, stating the tasks of all of Tukhachevsky's armies, of which only the essence had previously been known.|$|E
5|$|A Professional Edition was {{announced}} December 11, 2001, with marketing aimed towards business owners. This version features Norton Intrusion Detection, which <b>intercepts</b> suspicious connections and attacks, {{such as the}} Code Red worm. Intrusion Detection focuses on Windows-based attacks only. Central management is also present in this version. Administrators configure firewall and productivity settings for client computers. Productivity settings allow administrators to block newsgroups, websites, and advertisements. The suite integrates with XP user accounts; settings can be personalized for each user.|$|E
50|$|In {{the middle}} of April, the Commander of <b>Intercept</b> Troops Southeast moved to the Salonika area with the Tulln station, {{elements}} of the Graz station and one <b>intercept</b> company. The other <b>intercept</b> company was released for service in Russia.|$|R
30|$|The fixed effect model (FEM) is {{estimated}} to cross-check the heterogeneity that may exist among the 255 observations. The term fixed effect {{is caused by the}} fact that while the <b>intercept</b> may differ across countries, the <b>intercept</b> does not vary over time that is time invariant. FEM considers the heterogeneity that exists as it allows each country to have its own <b>intercept</b> value, thereby introducing <b>intercept</b> dummies.|$|R
50|$|Up to January 1940, {{the fixed}} <b>intercept</b> {{stations}} were under direct OKH jurisdiction {{with regard to}} long-range intelligence covering France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Great Britain. Following instructions from OKH, <b>Intercept</b> Evaluation Centre #3 , operating from Army Group 3 HQ in Frankfurt am Main, which was then responsible for operations in the West, ordered the mobile <b>intercept</b> companies to <b>intercept</b> Belgium and French traffic emanating from the border region. The <b>intercept</b> companies which became available for reassignment {{at the end of}} the Polish campaign were sent to the west.|$|R
5|$|As Captain Marvel arrives to take Morales into custody, Iron Man <b>intercepts</b> {{and attacks}} Captain Marvel. Medusa warns the other heroes of Ulysses' vision and they try {{in vain to}} stop the fight. After Captain Marvel {{delivers}} a seemingly fatal blow to Iron Man, Ulysses has multiple visions of possible futures. Ulysses is then approached by Eternity and takes a place at his side as a new cosmic entity. Later, Captain Marvel meets with the President of the United States and is offered unlimited resources to lead the superhero community into the future.|$|E
5|$|At the Playground, {{the former}} SSR base that {{now serves as}} S.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters, Director Phil Coulson recognizes the {{importance}} of the Obelisk, noting that it is the first 0-8-4, an object of unknown origin. Hydra double-agent, and S.H.I.E.L.D. prisoner, Grant Ward tells Agent Skye of secret frequencies Hydra uses to communicate, and Agent Billy Koenig <b>intercepts</b> Creel's next directive—to use the family of Brigadier General Glenn Talbot as leverage to find the Obelisk. Agent Melinda May, Skye, Hunter, and Hartley help Talbot fight off Creel, before abducting Talbot and deceiving him into giving them access codes for a U.S. military base near Washington, D.C. that contains numerous confiscated S.H.I.E.L.D. assets.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Adam Pierce, a {{scientist}} at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, <b>intercepts</b> a visual transmission from Firewalker, a mobile robot sent by a volcanic research project on Mount Avalon near Bend, Oregon. Firewalker is broadcasting from inside a volcanic cave, where Pierce glimpses the dead body of the chief seismologist, Phil Erickson. He also sees a shadow moving in the cave, an impossibility due to the extremely high temperatures. Firewalker's camera is then destroyed, ending the transmission.|$|E
50|$|Version 2.0 {{released}} in 2000 provided {{major and minor}} enhancements to all products in the <b>Intercept</b> product line. In addition to enhancements to existing capabilities <b>Intercept</b> 2.0 introduced integration to Visual Studio and VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) integration for implementing custom workflow rules. In the 2.0 time frame Elsinore Technologies also released Visual <b>Intercept</b> Project and integration to the products in the Microsoft Office suite. Visual <b>Intercept</b> Project was designed to help project managers dynamically update project plans by integrating them with the real time issue management data captured and tracked in Visual <b>Intercept.</b>|$|R

When {{questioned}} by Scully, X tells her to analyze her implant, saying that it will give her answers about the train and her sister Melissa's murder. Meanwhile, Mulder enters the train and finds that the secret railcar is quarantined and protected by a security system. He searches for Zama, enlisting the train conductor for help. In Zama's compartment, they find hand-written journals in Japanese. However, elsewhere on the train, the Red-Haired Man <b>intercepts</b> and strangles Zama.|$|E
5|$|Japanese radio <b>intercepts</b> did notice an {{increase}} in both American submarine activity and message traffic. This information was in Yamamoto's hands prior to the battle. Japanese plans, however, were not changed: Yamamoto, at sea in , assumed Nagumo had received the same signal from Tokyo, and did not communicate with him by radio, {{so as not to}} reveal his position. These messages were, contrary to earlier historical accounts, also received by Nagumo before the battle began. For reasons which remain unclear, Nagumo did not alter his plans or take additional precautions.|$|E
