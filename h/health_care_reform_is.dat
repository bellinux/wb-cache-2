40|$|Signs {{of discontent}} with the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> system are growing. Calls for <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reform</b> <b>are</b> largely {{motivated}} by the continued increase in <b>health</b> <b>care</b> costs and {{the large number of}} people without adequate health insurance. For the past 20 years, <b>health</b> <b>care</b> spending has risen at rates higher than the gross national product. As many as 35 million people are without health insurance. As proposals for <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reform</b> <b>are</b> developed, it is useful to understand the roots of the cost problem. Causes of spiraling <b>health</b> <b>care</b> costs include "market failure" in the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> market, expansion in technology, excessive administrative costs, unnecessary care and defensive medicine, increased patient complexity, excess capacity within the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> system, and low productivity. Attempts to control costs, by the federal government for the Medicare program and then by the private sector, have to date been mostly unsuccessful.

5000|$|Consider a {{hypothetical}} conversation between two parties {{about health care}} reform. One party may wish to argue the moral necessity {{of health care reform}} while the other party wishes to argue that <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reform</b> <b>is</b> economically infeasible. Until both parties agree on the issue at hand (whether it be the economic or moral considerations of health care reform), resolution of the argument cannot take place. Once the parties have agreed on the issue at hand, they have achieved rhetorical stasis. The idea of first agreeing to the issue at hand is central to any discussion between rational people. One example of how stasis can apply to health and medical rhetoric is provided in a recent article by Christa Teston and Scott Graham. These researchers applied the rhetorical concept of stasis to medical discourse by reviewing the FDA discussion on Avastin as a treatment for metastatic breast cancer. They concluded that the absence of stasis resulted in miscommunication between the interested parties. The FDA could have achieved stasis, these authors conclude, by first reaching consensus on the following questions: What counts as clinical benefit? What kinds of evidence would be deemed meaningful? ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reform</b> <b>is</b> {{not about}} health care {{so much as it}} focuses on the {{delivery}} and financing of health care. As such, <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reform</b> <b>is</b> about the administrative sciences, as represented in the area of Pharmacy Administration—most of the issues addressed in our broad area of study are directly addressed and affected by health care reform initiatives. Because of this, I have chosen to address the field of the social and administrative sciences, a State of the Discipline address, if you will, rather than offer my version of the future. In 1994, the main focus of attention in the administra-tive sciences is pharmacoeconomics. In the scramble toward pharmacoeconomics, several phenomena are occurring. The Boston Consulting Group has found that each year over 700 health economics studies are published, and each pharma-ceutical company begins, on average, 23 new studies(1).

40|$|If <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>reform</b> <b>is</b> {{implemented}} in states and nationally, {{the safety of}} this process needs to be examined for persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Reform should assure ongoing prevention and transmission control of HIV and continuous coverage of medical costs for persons ill with HIV or AIDS. These persons currently benefit from various state and federal categoric programs designed to assure access to preventive and personal care services. Washington State has passed health care reform legislation that envisions integrating these programs to provide a system of population-based and personal health care. This legislation was analyzed using existing epidemiologic and entitlement information about persons with HIV infection or AIDS {{in the state to}} assess its effect. The relationship between public health and personal care services will be a central concern for those with HIV infection or AIDS, and complete coverage of this group may be achieved relatively late in the process of implementing health care reform. Health personnel planning under health care reform will affect the delivery of HIV- and AIDS-related services. Including treatment of AIDS in the basic benefit package merits particular attention.
