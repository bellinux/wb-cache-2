5|$|Edward {{informed}} Baldwin that {{he would}} abdicate {{if he could not}} marry Simpson. Baldwin then presented Edward with three choices: give up the idea of marriage; marry against his ministers' wishes; or abdicate. It was clear that Edward was not prepared to give up Simpson, and he <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> married against the advice of his ministers, he would cause the government to resign, prompting a constitutional crisis. He chose to abdicate.|$|E
5|$|On December 17, 1851, Henry Clay {{submitted}} {{a letter of}} resignation of his seat in the U.S. Senate, to be effective September 1 of the following year (1852). Clay's announcement came while the Kentucky General Assembly was in session. This was intentional. The majority of the Assembly was Whig, and Clay <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> resigned while the Assembly was in session, the majority would elect a Whig to be his successor. By contrast, if he had waited until September 1 to announce his resignation the Assembly would already have closed its session, and Governor Powell, a Democrat, would appoint a temporary successor until the legislature convened again two years later.|$|E
5|$|As Sercey left Batavia {{he turned}} eastward along the {{northern}} coast of Java to avoid the British commander in the region, Admiral Peter Rainier who was escorting four ships through the Straits of Malacca to the west. However six East Indiamen were sailing to transit the Bali Strait {{on their way to}} China. On 28 January, {{at the entrance to the}} Strait, Sercey's squadron and the East Indiamen met. The EIC Commodore, James Farquharson, captain of , <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> fled the French would rapidly overwhelm his ships so he decided to try a bluff. He would attempt to lead Sercey into believing that the convoy was formed not from lightly armed East Indiamen, but from the powerful ships of the line that the Indiamen resembled. Farquharson ordered his ships to advance in line of battle.|$|E

5|$|When Augustus died in 14 AD, the Principate legally ended. Tiberius <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{secured the}} support of the army, the rest of the {{government}} would soon follow. Therefore, Tiberius assumed command of the Praetorian Guard, and used his Proconsular imperium to force the armies to swear allegiance to him. As soon as this occurred, the Senate and the magistrates acquiesced. Under Tiberius, the power to elect magistrates was transferred from the assemblies to the Senate. When Tiberius died, Caligula was proclaimed Emperor by the Senate. In 41 Caligula was assassinated, and for two days following his assassination, the Senate debated the merits of restoring the Republic. Due {{to the demands of the}} army, however, Claudius was declared emperor, but he was ultimately killed, and Nero was declared Emperor.|$|E
25|$|Rather than pursue them, Pyrrhus went {{straight}} for Rome along the via Appia {{and then the}} via Latina. He <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> continued on the via Appia he could be trapped in the marsh. Wary of such entrapment on the via Latina also, he withdrew without fighting after encountering opposition at Anagni. Wintering in Campania, he withdrew to Apulia in 279BC, where, pursued by the Romans, he won a second costly victory at the Battle of Asculum. Withdrawing from Apulia for a Sicilian interlude, he returned to Apulia in 275BC and started for Campania up the nice Roman road.|$|E
25|$|When Augustus died in 14 AD, the Principate legally ended. While Augustus had granted Tiberius {{the legal}} {{standing}} {{that he needed}} in order to become Princeps (i.e., Roman Emperor), Augustus could not legally make Tiberius Princeps. However, Tiberius' legal powers, as well as his status as the chosen heir of Augustus, gave him an opportunity that his ambition could not refuse. Tiberius <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> secured the support of the army, the rest of the government would soon follow. Therefore, Tiberius assumed command of the Praetorian Guard, and used his Proconsular imperium to force the armies to swear allegiance to him. As soon as this occurred, the senate and the magistrates acquiesced. Tiberius' efforts were so successful, that when the senate declared him Princeps, he made his acceptance appear to be a concession {{to the demands of the}} senators. Under Tiberius, the power to elect magistrates was transferred from the assemblies to the senate. Now, the assemblies were only used to hear the results of magisterial elections. In addition, they did retain some theoretical legislative powers. When Tiberius died, Caligula was proclaimed emperor by the senate. Caligula transferred the electoral powers back to the assemblies, but then quickly returned those powers to the senate. In 41 Caligula was assassinated, and for two days following his assassination, the senate debated the merits of restoring the republic. Due to the demands of the army, however, Claudius was ultimately declared emperor. Claudius' antiquarian interests resulted in his attempts to revive the old Censorship, and to return some degree of independence back to the senate. Ultimately, Claudius was killed, and Nero was declared emperor.|$|E

Once the FBI had a positive identification, they stepped up surveillance, following Fisher from his studio to the Hotel Latham. Fisher {{was aware of the}} [...] "tail" [...] but, as he had no passport to leave the country, he devised a plan to be used upon his capture.

500|$|The {{market for}} science fiction {{expanded}} dramatically the following year; several new magazines were launched, including Startling Stories in January 1939, Unknown in March (a fantasy companion to Astounding, also edited by Campbell), Fantastic Adventures in May, and Planet Stories in December. [...] All of the competing magazines, including {{the two main}} extant titles, Wonder Stories and Amazing Stories, were publishing space opera, stories of interplanetary adventure, or other well-worn ideas {{from the early days}} of the genre. [...] Campbell's attempts to make science fiction more mature led to a natural division of the writers: those who were unable to write to his standards continued to sell to other magazines; and those who could sell to Campbell quickly focused their attention on Astounding and sold relatively little to the other magazines. [...] The expansion of the market also benefited Campbell because writers <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> rejected their submissions, they could resubmit those stories elsewhere; this freed them to try to write to his standards.|$|E

Conein refused to see the proof, realising that having such knowledge would compromise his cover and his safety. He returned to the embassy and submitted his report to Washington. The CIA in Saigon later secured a set of photos of the brothers that left no doubt that they had been executed. The photos were taken at about 10:00, 2 November, showing the dead brothers covered in blood on the floor of an APC. They were dressed in the robes of Roman Catholic priests with their hands tied behind their backs. Their faces were bloodied and bruised and they had been repeatedly stabbed. The images appeared to be genuine, discrediting the generals' claims that the brothers had committed suicide. The pictures were distributed around the world, having been sold to media outlets in Saigon. The caption below a picture published in Time read [...] "'Suicide' with no hands." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, Furtwängler's {{position}} was weakened: he <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> left Germany, Karajan would immediately become the {{conductor of the}} Berlin Philharmonic. It {{was the beginning of}} an obsessive hate and contempt for Karajan that never left him until his death. He often refused to call Karajan by his name, calling him simply [...] "Herr K". Hitler's opinion was that even if Furtwängler was infinitely better than Karajan as a conductor, it was necessary to keep Karajan [...] "in reserve" [...] since Furtwängler was [...] "not politically trustworthy".|$|E

They <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could only survive two balls they would see something in batting unknown to any textbook.” Bateman added, “when it was time to get his pads on, Eric would prop his bat up in the Edgbaston dressing room window and say to it: ‘Now while I’m getting ready, you find out what the ball’s doing’”.|$|E
2500|$|The SIC {{conspiracy}} {{collapsed in}} March 1872, but between February 17 and March 28, 1872, Rockefeller {{was able to}} buy out 22 of the 26 major refiners in Cleveland, an event which historians call [...] "the Cleveland Massacre". Stone played a major part in the success of the event. Rockefeller <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> bought out the weak refiners first, he'd generate opposition and never get a chance to take on the larger, more profitable ones. So he tackled his strongest competitor, the firm of Clark, Payne & Co., led by Oliver Hazard Payne and backed by the wealthy J. G. Hussey family. In December 1871, Rockefeller asked Payne to meet him at the Second National Bank in Cleveland to discuss business matters in which the bank had an interest. Stone and Stillman Witt were both officers in the bank. Payne swiftly agreed to a merger of his interests with Rockefeller's, and the transaction closed in early January 1872.|$|E

2500|$|Also in November 1943, Lecca conceded {{control over}} 15% of Jewish tax revenues. That money was {{returned}} to the CE, to be sent as humanitarian aid to the Jewish deportees and labor conscripts. Also then, allegedly with Killinger's consent, Lecca managed to obtain the reassignment of Gustav Richter from his post in Jewish affairs to more regular police work, proposing that: [...] "Richter no longer has anything to direct within the Central Jewish Office." [...] Although aware that Richter's network of spies was still at work within Jewish affairs departments, Lecca believed that Richter had since lost his motive for murder: [...] "He was a young man, he had a wife and child, and he <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> lost his position in the legation [...] {{he would have to}} leave straight for the front." [...] However, both Lecca and SSI director Eugen Cristescu recalled that, in his new capacity, Richter obtained the January 1944 arrest of several Zionist leaders (Filderman, Benvenisti etc.), whom he denounced as conspirators against Germany; all were freed the next month, when the International Red Cross pleaded in their favor.|$|E
2500|$|How can we {{find out}} of the single {{individual}} is ready for eternal salvation? Kierkegaard says, [...] "Any army sometimes has a select little group called the immortal battalion, and a warrior esteems it a great honor to be accepted into it. Let us suppose {{that there was a}} man who was just as concerned about being in that battalion as everyone ought to be concerned about being an heir of heaven's salvation. The conditions were sufficiently known; distinction in battle was required, but also a certain appearance, a specific height, physique, etc. He would then examine himself to see whether he filled all the requirements, not in general, not casually, because he would be too concerned for that, and he <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was deficient in merely the slightest way he would not be accepted. And whether anything was lacking or everything was present in the right proportion the commander would decide in his appraisal. Can we talk about the Christian in the same way? No. Kierkegaard says, [...] "every person has heaven's salvation, only by the grace and mercy of God, and this is equally close to every human being {{in the sense that it}} is a matter between God and him; and let no third person, himself having been restored to grace, forfeit this by unwarranted interference. [...] If there was a person who embittered my life early and late and thought nothing but the worst of me, would his also being saved be able to disturb my salvation? ...|$|E
2500|$|Forty-four {{miles east}} of the {{collision}} site, the French Line's [...] was eastbound from New York en route to her home port of Le Havre, France, with 940 passengers and a crew of 826 aboard. At 44,500 tons and 739 feet in length, the 30-year-old luxury liner was among the largest passenger liners on the North Atlantic run. On that voyage, having left New York the same day as the Stockholm, she was under the command of Captain Raoul de Beaudean, a well-respected veteran of the seas who had served the French Line for 35 years. Upon hearing of the collision and the distress call, de Beaudean was at first skeptical of the thought of a modern ship like Andrea Doria actually foundering, and <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> did steer back to the collision site only to find that Île de France was not needed, it would mean having to return to New York to refuel and delaying her passengers, which could have been a financial disaster for the French Line. At the same time, he knew that if his services were needed, the French Line would not question his actions in that case. Captain de Beaudean made an attempt to contact Andrea Doria {{to learn more about the}} situation, which was unsuccessful, but after making contact with Stockholm, Cape Ann, and Thomas, he quickly realized the severity of the situation and that the lives of over 1,600 people were at risk. He quickly turned Île de France around and set a direct course for the stricken Andrea Doria.|$|E
