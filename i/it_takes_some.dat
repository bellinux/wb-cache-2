5|$|Plan 9 from Bell Labs is a {{distributed}} operating system, {{originally developed}} by the Computing Sciences Research Center at Bell Labs between the mid-1980s and 2002. <b>It</b> <b>takes</b> <b>some</b> {{of the principles of}} Unix, developed in the same research group, but extends these to a networked environment with graphical terminals.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} forms of malware, {{security}} software (antivirus software) might not detect a ransomware payload, or, {{especially in the case}} of encrypting payloads, only after encryption is under way or complete, particularly if a new version unknown to the protective software is distributed. If an attack is suspected or detected in its early stages, <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>some</b> time for encryption to take place; immediate removal of the malware (a relatively simple process) before it has completed would stop further damage to data, without salvaging any already lost.|$|E
5|$|Small on {{the huge}} bench sits a wasted man with untidy white hair, an {{emaciated}} face {{in which two}} burning eyes are set like jewels, parchment-like skin split by a crack for a mouth; the face of Andrew Jackson three years dead... Upon this man has devolved the historic role of trying the Social Revolution. He is doing it like a gentleman. In many ways a most unusual trial. When the judge enters the court-room after recess, no one risesâ€”he himself has abolished the pompous formality. He sits without robes, in an ordinary business suit, and often leaves the bench {{to come down and}} perch on the step of the jury box. By his personal orders, spittoons are placed by the prisoners' seats... and as for the prisoners themselves, they are permitted to take off their coats, move around, read newspapers. <b>It</b> <b>takes</b> <b>some</b> human understanding for a Judge to fly in the face of judicial ritual as much as that.|$|E

25|$|In a {{test drive}} of the LP550-2 Valentino Balboni, the test driver bearing {{the name of}} the car said he was against E-gear because <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>some</b> amount of vehicle control away from the driver, and all-wheel drive Lamborghinis from the beginning, and the company was divided over AWD cars. In that review, a LP550-2 with E-Gear was tested.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of reasons for low sales outside Japan. One main reason is that <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>some</b> time for the {{customers}} {{to get used to the}} idea of a washlet. Sales in Japan were also slow when the device was introduced in 1980, but after some acclimatization, sales improved significantly starting in 1985. Around 1990, 10% of Japanese households had a washlet, and this number increased greatly to over 50% in 2002. Toto expects a corresponding improvement in foreign sales within the next few years. Another reason is the lack of a power supply near the toilet. While virtually all Japanese washrooms have an electric outlet behind the toilet, many foreign bathrooms do not have a nearby outlet. In Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the UK, and many other countries, high current electrical outlets installed in close proximity to water, or where persons may be wet, are prohibited by legally enforced codes due to health and safety reasons. Finally the outlet of the toilet (for S-type toilets) is max. 10 ~ 15cm from back wall but Japanese toilets need it to be at least 30cm so a S-type European toilet cannot be replaced easily with a Japanese toilet. They are also much more expensive than traditional Western toilets. Finally, in Europe, there is the competition of the traditional Western bidet; conversely, North Americans are not accustomed to any sort of bidet.|$|E
500|$|Disney was {{concerned}} with Lasseter's position {{on the use of}} music. Unlike other Disney films of the time, Lasseter did not want the film to be a musical, saying it was a buddy film featuring [...] "real toys." [...] Joss Whedon agreed, saying, [...] "It would have been a really bad musical, because it's a buddy movie. It's about people who won't admit what they want, much less sing about it. ... Buddy movies are about sublimating, punching an arm, 'I hate you.' It's not about open emotion." [...] However, Disney favored the musical format, claiming [...] "Musicals are our orientation. Characters breaking into song is a great shorthand. <b>It</b> <b>takes</b> <b>some</b> of the onus off what they're asking for." [...] Disney and Pixar reached a compromise: the characters in Toy Story would not break into song, but the film would use non-diegetic songs over the action, as in The Graduate, to convey and amplify the emotions that Buzz and Woody were feeling. Disney and Lasseter tapped Randy Newman to compose the film. The edited Toy Story was due to Newman and Gary Rydstrom in late September 1995 for their final work on the score and sound design, respectively.|$|E

500|$|Boosinger {{said that}} while the game retains the comedy of the Ace Attorney series and has great {{character}} writing, he found the story to be dull, slow, and too long. Ronaghan called the dialogue funny, and said that the game was well-paced, long, and enjoyable. Goldstein called the story interesting, but said that it at times plays out [...] "like a bad soap opera". Walker appreciated the choice to make Edgeworth the game's lead character, and called Kay a fantastic addition. He found the translation of the game to be incredible, despite a number of spelling mistakes. Hopper appreciated that the game has a new protagonist and setting, and called the dialogue [...] "cheesy but charming". On the other hand, he said {{that there is a lot}} of superfluous text in the game, making the cases longer than they need to be. Parker said that <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>some</b> time to get used to playing as Edgeworth, saying that he is not as immediately engaging as Phoenix and Apollo. She called the story deep and intricate, and slow but solid. Ronaghan called the art style and presentation wonderful, and said that each character [...] "oozes with personality", but that the animation, while better than that in previous titles, was limited to only a few frames at a time. Goldstein called the characters colorful, but found the locations to be uninteresting. Hopper called the game's aesthetic [...] "anime-esque" [...] and clean, and said that the static images were decent. Parker liked the game's presentation, and called the environments [...] "beautifully drawn".|$|E
500|$|... is a {{forbidden}} summoning jutsu {{that is used}} {{to revive}} the dead in a state of near-life. The process of this jutsu begins by obtaining a genetic sample from the deceased, either through grave robbery or blood stains and salvaged organs. A living person is then sacrificed for the deceased spirit to inhabit and serve as a slave to the user's will. However, the Jutsu can only function if the deceased soul is within the realm of Pure Land and not elsewhere in the afterlife like in the stomach of the Reaper. Though it was the Tobirama Senju who invented the Reanimation Jutsu for the purpose of creating an indestructible army used in suicide attacks, the jutsu was later completed by Orochimaru when he [...] revived Tobirama Senju and Hashirama Senju. Kabuto perfected the jutsu {{to the point where he}} is able to revive dozens of ninja in one execution, needing to focus all his mental energy to fully control them. People revived through this process are almost invulnerable to even the most fatal attacks, as they will simply regenerate any damage taken (although <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>some</b> time for especially damaging attacks like Rasengan and they can also be paralyzed by specific attacks, such as poison). Having already died, the resurrected expel any basic needs living people required; they have unlimited chakra and power due to not needing to replenish them. In addition, they cannot be subjected to genjutsu jutsu that affect living things like the Infinite Tsukuyomi. The only effective means to destroy a ninja brought back is with Yin-Yang Style techniques that damage the body beyond regeneration to the point of death.|$|E

2500|$|Fanny Price: The second {{eldest of}} nine {{children}} who {{is sent to}} live with her mother's sisters at Mansfield Park at age 10. Fanny is sensitive, shy, intelligent, virtuous, with a good sense of morals; and her status at Mansfield Park as a dependent poor relation only intensifies these traits. Much of the novel takes place when she is 18 and 19. She has been in love with her cousin Edmund since she was young. However, <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>some</b> time until Edmund realizes that he reciprocates. Prior to her cousin's revelation, Henry Crawford tries unsuccessfully to woo Fanny.

2500|$|Wealth and {{literacy}} have some effect on turnout, {{but are not}} reliable measures. Countries such as Angola and Ethiopia have long had high turnouts, but so have the wealthy states of Europe. The United Nations Human Development Index shows some correlation between higher standards of living and higher turnout. The age of a democracy {{is also an important}} factor. Elections require considerable involvement by the population, and <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>some</b> time to develop the cultural habit of voting, and the associated understanding of and confidence in the electoral process. This factor may explain the lower turnouts in the newer democracies of Eastern Europe and Latin America. Much of the impetus to vote comes from a sense of civic duty, which takes time and certain social conditions that can take decades to develop: ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{praising the}} {{performances}} of Cumberbatch and Knightley, Catherine Shoard of The Guardian stated that the film is [...] "too formulaic, too efficient at simply whisking you through and making sure you've clocked the diversity message". Tim Robey of The Telegraph described it as [...] "a film about a human calculator which feels... a little too calculated". Some critics also raised concerns about film's alleged reluctance to highlight Turing's homosexuality. British historian Alex von Tunzelmann, writing for The Guardian in November 2014, pointed out many historical inaccuracies in the film, saying in conclusion: [...] "Historically, The Imitation Game is {{as much of a}} garbled mess as a heap of unbroken code". Journalist Christian Caryl also found numerous historical inaccuracies, describing the film as constituting [...] "a bizarre departure from the historical record" [...] that changed Turing's rich life to be [...] "multiplex-friendly". L.V. Anderson of Slate magazine compared the film's account of Turing's life and work to the biography it was based on, writing, [...] "I discovered that The Imitation Game takes major liberties with its source material, injecting conflict where none existed, inventing entirely fictional characters, rearranging the chronology of events, and misrepresenting the very nature of Turing's work at Bletchley Park". Andrew Grant of Science News wrote, [...] "... like so many other Hollywood biopics, <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>some</b> major artistic license â€“ which is disappointing, because Turing's actual story is so compelling." [...] Computing historian Thomas Haigh, writing in the journal Communications of the ACM, said that [...] "the film is a bad guide to reality but a useful summary of everything that the popular imagination gets wrong about Bletchley Park", that it [...] "combines the traditional focus of popular science writing on the lone genius who changes the world with the modern movie superhero narrative of a freak who must overcome his own flaws before he can save the world", and that, together with the likes of A Beautiful Mind and The Theory of Everything, is part of a trend of [...] "glossy scientific biopic" [...] that emphasize those famous scientists who were surrounded by tragedy rather than those who found contented lives, which in turn affects the way [...] "ome kinds of people, and work, have become famous and others have not." ...|$|E
