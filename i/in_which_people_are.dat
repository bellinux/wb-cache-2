Movements such as the Civil Rights Movement and the Anti-Apartheid Movement were examples of anti-racist movements. Nonviolent resistance is sometimes embraced as an element of anti-racist movements, although this was not always the case. Hate crime laws, affirmative action, and bans on racist speech are also examples of government policy which is intended to suppress racism.|$|E
25|$|Scholars {{view the}} shapeshifting Anyanwu as a fictional {{representation}} of Donna Haraway’s “cyborg” identity {{as defined in}} her 1985 essay “A Cyborg Manifesto.” Specifically, Anyanwu embodies Haraway’s “lived social and bodily realities <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> not afraid of their joint kinship with animals and machines, not afraid of permanently partial identities and contradictory standpoints” as her shapeshifting abilities compete with Doro’s genetic engineering. Anyanwu’s hybridity, her capability to represent multiple simultaneous identities, allows her to survive, to have agency, and to remain true to herself and her history {{in the midst of}} excruciating oppression and change.|$|E

25|$|The National Democratic Revolution (NDR) is {{described}} as a process through which the National Democratic Society (NDS) is achieved; a society <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> intellectually, socially, economically and politically empowered. The drivers of the NDR are also called the motive forces and are defined as the elements within society that gain from the success of the NDR. Using contour plots or concentric circles the centre represents the elements in society that gain the most out {{of the success of the}} NDR. Moving away from the centre results in the reduction of the gains that those elements derive. It is generally believed that the force that occupies the centre of those concentric circles in countries with low unemployment is the working class while in countries with higher levels of unemployment it is the unemployed. Some of the many theoreticians that have written about the NDR include Joe Slovo, Joel Netshitenzhe and Tshilidzi Marwala.|$|E

Some residents are seen committing crimes such as shoplifting, and attempting to raise money to support themselves and their families. Others are shown to have more ambition, such as a young mother who wants to become a model. The series also aims to show the street's sense of community spirit, with residents helping each other in times of difficulty.|$|E

500|$|Treviño Morales {{acted as}} a cartel 'gate-keeper,' and his people {{collected}} a piso (tariff) at all drug territories controlled by Los Zetas. He controlled the highly lucrative Nuevo Laredo plaza (turf), {{across the border from}} Laredo, Texas. He bribed and intimidated officials to help maintain control, and responded to any challenges to his authority or control with brutal violence. Treviño was feared and very few local journalists dared to write about him. He was alleged to favored a torture method known as the guiso (stew), <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> stuffed into an oil barrel, doused with gasoline, and set on fire to burn alive. His violent behavior gained him [...] "the notoriety of a cult figure." [...] He reportedly survived gun battles unharmed, avoided making alliances with anyone, dismembered dozens of victims while they were still alive and dumped them, and [...] "seemed unafraid to die." [...] Organization members claimed that Treviño Morales enjoyed driving around the city in a car, pointing at people randomly and saying, [...] "kill this one and kill that one." [...] A former hitman who worked for him told the press in 2013 that Treviño Morales could not sleep at night if he did not kill someone. He also said that the drug lord would ask his victims how they wanted to be killed. Journalist Alfredo Corchado, head of The Dallas Morning News in Mexico, wrote in one of his books that Treviño Morales enjoyed eating out the hearts of his victims—even when they were still alive—because he believed that doing that would make him invincible among his enemies and authorities.|$|E

2500|$|Intersectionality is the {{examination}} of various ways <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> oppressed, based on the relational web of dominating factors of race, sex, class, nation and sexual orientation. Intersectionality [...] "describes the simultaneous, multiple, overlapping, and contradictory systems of power that shape our lives and political options". While this theory {{can be applied to}} all people, and more particularly all women, it is specifically mentioned and studied within the realms of black feminism. Patricia Hill Collins argues that black women in particular, have a unique perspective on the oppression of the world as unlike white women, they face both racial and gender oppression simultaneously, among other factors. This debate raises the issue of understanding the oppressive lives of women that are not only shaped by gender alone but by other elements such as racism, classism, ageism, heterosexism, ableism etc.|$|E
2500|$|Her {{lyrics are}} equally eclectic, often taking {{the form of}} {{abstract}} narratives or first-person character studies, similar to short stories or vignettes put to song. Spektor usually sings in English, though she sometimes includes a few words or verses of Latin, Russian, French, and other languages in her songs. She also plays with pronunciations, which she said on a NPR interview to be a remnant of her early years when she listened to pop in English without understanding the lyrics. Some of Spektor's lyrics include literary allusions, such as: F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway in [...] "Poor Little Rich Boy"; The Little Prince in [...] "Baobabs"; Virginia Woolf and Margaret Atwood in [...] "Paris"; Ezra Pound and William Shakespeare in [...] "Pound of Flesh", Boris Pasternak in [...] "Après Moi"; Samson and Delilah in [...] "Samson"; Oedipus Rex in [...] "Oedipus"; Edith Wharton's Ethan Frome in [...] "2.99¢ Blues". Recurring themes and topics in Spektor's lyrics include love, death, religion (particularly Biblical and Jewish references), city life (particularly New York references), and certain key phrases which recur in different songs, such as references to gravediggers, the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil and the name [...] "Mary Ann". Spektor's use of satire is evident in [...] "Wasteside", which refers to The Twelve Chairs, the classic satirical novel by the Soviet authors Ilf and Petrov, and describes the town <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> born, get their hair cut, and then are sent to the cemetery.|$|E
