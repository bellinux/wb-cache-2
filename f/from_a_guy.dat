500|$|Reviews of {{the book}} were positive, with Nolan Howell of Canoe.com {{describing}} it as a [...] "straightforward look {{into the life of}} a man that has dedicated himself to the sport of professional wrestling" [...] and has [...] "an endearing, personal style that gives an apt representation of the author...For fans such as myself who appreciated the blunt style of the man known as Hardcore Holly, this ECW Press product will be an entertaining, worthwhile look into one of the unique personalities of professional wrestling." [...] Joe Babinsack, writing for the Wrestling Observer, described the book as [...] "brutal, boisterous and definitely worth reading". Bruce Mitchell, writing for the Pro Wrestling Torch, described the book as [...] "hard-hitting, straightforward, and not very fancy", rating it [...] "one of the strongest professional wrestling books in a long while". Dave Meltzer, editor of the Wrestling Observer wrote, [...] "in a lot of books, you think you're reading what the person writing feels {{is the right thing to}} say for their career... With Holly, whether you agree or not (and I agreed with some of his stuff, not others), I had no doubt he was giving his true opinions on things. In that sense, it was a very honest look at a period of WWF history <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> who had ups and downs... but survived a long time." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{his first}} season with Cleveland, in 1992, Lofton hit [...]285. His 66 stolen bases broke the all-time record for an American League rookie and was the most by a Major League rookie since Vince Coleman stole 110 in 1985. His season's stolen base count, which led the AL, also broke a {{franchise}} record (previously set by Miguel Diloné in 1980). Indians first base coach Dave Nelson helped Lofton refine his baserunning technique and helped {{learn how to be}} successful with bunting. Lofton finished second (to the Milwaukee Brewers' Pat Listach) in AL Rookie of the Year balloting. After one season with Cleveland, Lofton agreed to a four-year, $6.3 million contract. The following season, Lofton broke his own Cleveland single-season stolen bases' record, recording 70 (which led the MLB). Lofton was selected to his first career All-Star Game during the 1994 season. His development and impact in the league led Brewers manager Phil Garner to say, [...] "I remember how raw he was, and I've never seen anybody develop into that type of player that fast." [...] Garner, who saw Lofton play in the minors, added, [...] "He went <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>guy</b> who could hardly get the ball past the infield to a guy who could hit the ball consistently. He always had good speed, but got lousy jumps and didn't run the bases well. He has turned into a dominant player." [...] The regular season was stopped abruptly with the MLB strike, which also led to the cancellation of the World Series. For the season, Lofton again led the AL with 60 stolen bases. His 160 hits on the season were highest in the AL and his [...]349 batting average would be a career-best. He finished fourth in Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) voting. When the strike began in August, the Indians were in second place by one game in the AL Central to the Chicago White Sox. Indians general manager John Hart said of Lofton, [...] "What a representative for our team and our city. He has the opportunity to be a George Brett-type player here, someone who is synonymous with a franchise." [...] Lofton would join fellow Indians Carlos Baerga, Albert Belle, and Jim Thome to form [...] "the backbone of some Indians teams that were as dominant as any." ...|$|E
