5|$|Contemporary batik is {{not limited}} to {{traditional}} or ritual wearing in Bali. Some designers promote batik Bali as elegant <b>fabric</b> <b>that</b> {{can be used to make}} casual or formal cloth. Using high class batik, like hand made batik tulis, can show social status.|$|E
5|$|Gauze is {{reputed to}} have {{originated}} in Gaza. Cloth for the Gaza thob was often woven at nearby Majdal (Ascalon). Black or blue cottons or striped pink and green <b>fabric</b> <b>that</b> {{had been made}} in Majdal continued to be woven throughout the Gaza Strip by refugees from the coastal plain villages until the 1960s. Thobs here had narrow, tight, straight sleeves. Embroidery was much less dense than that applied in Hebron. The most popular motifs included: scissors (muqass), combs (mushut) and triangles (hijab) often arranged in clusters of fives, sevens and threes, as the use of odd numbers is considered in Arab folklore to be effective against the evil eye.|$|E
5|$|Local weavers {{specialised}} in {{the production}} of kersey, a hardwearing and inexpensive woollen <b>fabric</b> <b>that</b> was often used for military uniforms; by the 16thcentury Halifax and the surrounding Calder Valley was the largest producer of the material in England. In the final part of the manufacturing process the cloth was hung outdoors on large structures known as tenterframes and left to dry, after having been conditioned by a fulling mill. Daniel Defoe wrote a detailed account of what he had been told of the gibbet's history during his visit to Halifax in Volume 3 of his A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain, published in 1727.|$|E

5|$|She {{then had}} the idea to weave some of it, so she kept some for herself. Having {{observed}} {{the life of the}} silk worm on the recommendation of her husband, the Yellow Emperor, she began to instruct her entourage in the art of raising silk worms, sericulture. From this point, the girl became the goddess of silk in Chinese mythology. Silk eventually left China via the heir of a princess who was promised to a prince of Khotan. This probably occurred in the early 1st century CE. The princess, refusing to go without the <b>fabric</b> <b>that</b> she loved, would finally break the imperial ban on silk-worm exportation.|$|E
5|$|The Courtyard Cafe and The Fountain {{located within}} the Library also became an institution, well-patronised by library users, office workers and the local arts {{community}} from The Substation. As such, many fond memories were created for those who visited the compounds of the Library. At the same time, the pressure of urban redevelopment in the city was building up, resulting in demolishing of old city <b>fabric</b> <b>that</b> would threaten the Library building's fate and its sentimental memories in the ensuing years.|$|E

25|$|A {{permanent}} press is {{a characteristic of}} <b>fabric</b> <b>that</b> has been chemically processed to resist wrinkles and hold its shape. This treatment has a lasting effect on the fabric, namely in shirts, trousers, and slacks. Permanent press was invented in 1964 by Ruth Rogan Benerito, research leader of the Physical Chemistry Research Group of the Cotton Chemical Reactions Laboratory.|$|E
25|$|In {{conventional}} pointe shoes, the box {{is typically}} made from tightly packed layers of paper and <b>fabric</b> <b>that</b> have been glued together and then shaped into an enclosure. When the glue dries, it becomes hard and provides the required stiffness. In some newer pointe shoes, the box may be made from plastic and rubber, with rigidity provided by the plastic.|$|E
25|$|When {{making a}} quilt it is {{important}} to mark the <b>fabric</b> <b>that</b> you are cutting in order {{to have some kind of}} guidance when cutting the fabric, or you could use a quilting ruler and rotary cutter. When marking the fabric it is advised that you use a fabric marker, which is a marker that washes out when the quilt is washed or will fade away after repeated washes.|$|E
5000|$|E-textiles, {{also known}} as smart garments, smart clothing, {{electronic}} textiles, smart textiles, or smart <b>fabrics,</b> are <b>fabrics</b> <b>that</b> enable digital components (including small computers), and electronics to be embedded in them. Smart textiles are <b>fabrics</b> <b>that</b> have been developed with new technologies that provide added value to the wearer. Pailes-Friedman of the Pratt Institute states that [...] "what makes smart <b>fabrics</b> revolutionary is <b>that</b> {{they have the ability}} to do many things <b>that</b> traditional <b>fabrics</b> cannot, including communicate, transform, conduct energy and even grow". Smart textiles can be broken into two different categories: aesthetic and performance enhancing. Aesthetic examples include <b>fabrics</b> <b>that</b> light up and <b>fabrics</b> <b>that</b> can change color. Some of these fabrics gather energy from the environment by harnessing vibrations, sound or heat, reacting to these inputs. Performance enhancing smart textiles are intended for use in athletic, extreme sports and military applications. These include fabrics designed to regulate body temperature, reduce wind resistance, and control muscle vibration - all of which may improve athletic performance. Other fabrics have been developed for protective clothing, to guard against extreme environmental hazards, such as radiation and the effects of space travel. The health and beauty industry is also taking advantage of these innovations, which range from drug-releasing medical textiles, to fabric with moisturizer, perfume, and anti-aging properties. Many smart clothing, wearable technology, and wearable computing projects involve the use of e-textiles.|$|R

25|$|The Textile Fiber Products Identification Act and Wool Products Labeling Act {{require a}} Made in USA label on most {{clothing}} and other textile or wool household products if {{the final product}} is manufactured in the U.S. of <b>fabric</b> <b>that</b> is manufactured in the U.S., regardless of where materials earlier in the manufacturing process (for example, the yarn and fiber) came from. Textile products that are imported must be labeled {{as required by the}} Customs Service. A textile or wool product partially manufactured in the U.S. and partially manufactured in another country must be labeled to show both foreign and domestic processing.|$|E
25|$|Consolidation is {{the process}} in which the fabric of the ceramic is {{strengthened}} by introducing a material into the <b>fabric</b> <b>that</b> will bind together. The most common ceramics that need consolidation are excavated pieces because they tend to have lost their bonding fabrics due to leeching or have absorbed soluble salts. A consolidant works in two ways: it either links to the particles in the ceramic chemically or it may form a support system mechanically without reacting with the fabric itself. Chemical consolidants that are used in modern conservation include isocyanates, silanes, siloxnes, and methyl methacrylates, however the consolidants that create a mechanical support system are used more frequently.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 80´s Kjell Eng, {{the founder of}} Engtex, got the idea to use {{textiles}} for protection and cut prevention. Having worked as a logger earlier in life, he was very aware of the danger in using and handling a chainsaw. The first generation of protective fabrics consisted of a multi-layered and specially designed tricot <b>fabric</b> <b>that</b> peeled off layer by layer at contact with the cutting chains. This was the start and the first-ever chainsaw protective fabric was born. Statistics showed a reduction in injuries at work-related accidents in forestry and logging. However the new fabrics did not stop the more severe accidents with deep cuts and lethal outcome.|$|E

25|$|At the Calico Printers' Association in Manchester in 1941, John Rex Whinfield and James Tennant Dickson {{discovered}} polyethylene terephthalate, {{known as}} PET, a common polyester compound found in plastic bottles and food, and {{also known as}} Terylene or Dacron. Cheslene and Crepes of Macclesfield discovered crimplene (the <b>fabric</b> <b>that</b> is now referred to as polyester). ICI Dyestuffs at Hexagon House, in Blackley in north Manchester, discovered Procion dyes. At the Winnington Laboratory on 27 March 1933, Eric Fawcett and Reginald Gibson discovered polythene in an ICI laboratory in Northwich, when reacting benzaldehyde with ethene at a pressure of 2,000 atmospheres; the process was improved in 1935 by Sir Michael Perrin.|$|E
25|$|While {{the name}} bikini {{was applied to}} the skimpy fashion that first {{revealed}} the wearer's navel, the fashion industry considers any two-piece swimsuit a bikini. Modern bikini fashions today are characterized by a simple, brief design: two triangles of <b>fabric</b> <b>that</b> form a bra and cover the woman's breasts and two triangles of fabric on the bottom forming a panty cut below the navel that cover the groin in front and the buttocks in back. The amount of coverage can vary widely, from a string bikini with very little coverage to a full design with maximum coverage. A topless swimsuit may still be considered a bikini, although naturally it is no longer a two-piece swimsuit.|$|E
25|$|Ballroom shoes {{fall into}} two categories: Ballroom and Latin American. Both are characterised by suede soles. Men's ballroom shoes are {{typically}} lace-ups with one-inch heels and patent leather uppers. Ladies' ballroom shoes are typically court shoes with two-inch heels, made of <b>fabric</b> <b>that</b> can be colored to match the dancer's dress. In contrast to the low Ballroom heel, which evenly distributes weight across the foot, Latin American shoes have higher heels designed to shift weight onto the toes. Latin shoes are also more flexible than ballroom shoes. Men's Latin shoes typically have 1.5- to 2-inch high, shaped heels, while Ladies' Latin shoes have 2,5-inch to 3-inch heels. Ladies shoes are typically open-toed and strapped.|$|E
