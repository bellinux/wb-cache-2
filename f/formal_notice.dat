25|$|In December 1991, the {{two governments}} were again in talks to extend the {{withdrawal}} of American forces for three years but this broke down as the United States refused to spell out in detail their withdrawal plans or say if nuclear weapons were kept on base; nuclear weapons were forbidden on Philippine soil. Finally, on December 27, President Corazon Aquino, who fought to delay the pullout to cushion the country's battered economy, issued a <b>formal</b> <b>notice</b> for the U.S. to leave {{what has been the}} U.S.'s largest overseas defense facility after Clark Air Base was closed, by the end of 1992.|$|E

As of 13 March 2014, couples who have entered into same-sex marriages overseas are recognised as married in England and Wales. The parts of the law that allow civil partnerships to be converted into marriages, and allow married people to change their legal gender while remaining married, came into force on 10 December 2014. Same-sex marriages in England and Wales began at midnight on 29 March 2014.|$|E
25|$|Given {{that other}} councils {{went into the}} new {{financial}} year having deliberately set no rate, and seven had incurred financial loss through their delay, Audit Commissioners considered whether to subject them to the same audits as had been ordered on Lambeth and Liverpool. As the <b>formal</b> <b>notice</b> of surcharges were {{being sent to the}} Lambeth and Liverpool councillors in autumn 1985, it was not clear to the Commissioners whether there was a significant distinction between them and the councils which had backed down earlier. At regular meetings of the Commission, deputy controller Cliff Nicholson had to give an update; his regular answer was that auditors were awaiting information from the councils before they could proceed. There were several reasons to delay action: the Lambeth and Liverpool appeals were proceeding, ratepayers were separately objecting to the accounts, and new auditors in Islington and Hackney were being challenged by the councils. The Commission also needed legal advice whether to proceed against all seven councils together, or one at a time.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, Kiss {{asked for}} Wendy and the Plasmatics {{to appear as}} a special guest on their tour. Kiss wanted the {{controversial}} street edge that Wendy would bring {{as part of their}} tour and for the Plasmatics it was a chance to play in front of different audiences in different markets than they would ordinarily play. By the end of the tour with KISS it was clear that, although the <b>formal</b> <b>notice</b> that Capitol would not pick up their option for a second album did not come in for six months, the relationship with Capitol was done. It had taken months and months for the deal to be done, months to record and release the album and now months {{to get out of the}} deal. Gene Simmons approached Wendy and Rod about producing the next Wendy O. Williams album. So as to avoid any wasted time in legal issues with Capitol Records, it was decided not to use the Plasmatics name on the record at all and was simply called WOW, the initials for Wendy O. Williams. Gene Simmons felt it would give him the freedom he wanted to add more new players to the album.|$|E
50|$|A {{registered}} office {{is the official}} address of an incorporated company, association or any other legal entity. Generally it will form {{part of the public}} record and is required in most countries where the registered organization or legal entity is incorporated.

50|$|In the United Kingdom {{and many}} other common law countries, the {{registered}} office address {{does not have to}} be where the organization conducts its actual business or trade, and it is not unusual for law firms, accountants or incorporation agents to provide the official registered office address service. In the United Kingdom all statutory correspondence for an incorporated organization (e.g. <b>formal</b> <b>notices,</b> service of process, tax and government communications) are postal mailed or hand delivered to the stated registered office address as recorded on the Companies House register. A registered physical office address is required for incorporated organizations to receive official correspondence and <b>formal</b> <b>notices</b> from government departments, investors, banks, shareholders and the general public.Under regulations implemented in the UK on 1 October 2009, company directors may now also use a registered office address instead of their private home address for contact on the Companies House register.The companies full registered name must appear in manner publicly visible on the premises. The Company's records previously had to be kept at the registered office and available for public inspection. Since 1 October 2009 it has been possible for companies to designate a single alternative inspection location (SAIL) as a place to keep their records which must be available for public inspection.|$|R

500|$|Commodore Joseph Smith, Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks, sent Ericsson <b>formal</b> <b>notice</b> of the {{acceptance}} of his proposal on 21 September 1861. Six days later, Ericsson {{signed a contract with}} Bushnell, John F. Winslow and John A. Griswold which stated that the four partners would equally share in the profits or the losses incurred by the construction of the ironclad. There was one major delay, however, over the signing of the actual contract with the government. Welles insisted that if Monitor didn't prove to be a [...] "complete success", the builders would have to refund every cent to the government. Winslow balked at this draconian provision and had to be persuaded by his partners to sign after the Navy rejected his attempt to amend the contract. The contract was finally signed on 4 October for a price of $275,000 to be paid in installments as work progressed.|$|E
500|$|At {{about this}} time, Seacole began to wear {{military}} medals. These are mentioned in {{an account of}} her appearance in the bankruptcy court in November 1856. A bust by George Kelly, based on an original by Count Gleichen from around 1871, depicts her wearing four medals, three {{of which have been}} identified as the British Crimea Medal, the French Légion d'honneur and the Turkish Order of the Medjidie medal. Robinson says that one is [...] "apparently" [...] a Sardinian award (Sardinia having joined Britain and France in supporting Turkey against Russia in the war). The Jamaican Daily Gleaner stated in her obituary on 9 June 1881 that she had also received a Russian medal, but it has not been identified. However, no <b>formal</b> <b>notice</b> of her award exists in the London Gazette, and it seems unlikely that Seacole was formally rewarded for her actions in Crimea; rather, she may have bought miniature or [...] "dress" [...] medals to display her support and affection for her [...] "sons" [...] in the Army.|$|E

Further disputes over the standard of roads in the park followed until, in 1907, the Estates Company presented a petition to Lancashire County Council demanding that Trafford Park should be an urban district in its own right, independent of Stretford. The county council dismissed the petition, but later that year, following a petition organised by the Trafford Park Ratepayers Association, a new local government ward, Park Ward, was created within Stretford, The new ward did not include {{the western part of the}} park however, which remained under the control of Barton-upon-Irwell.|$|R

In order to evaluate the adequacy of the law n° 14 - 04 relating to the audiovisual activity to the requirements of sector’s regulation, {{there is a need to}} assess the degree of organic independence, in the light of the fundamental elements which are: a low independence resulting from the subordination to the executive power, at the level of appointment and financial and administrative levels. Regarding the prerogatives obtained, they are very limited and restricted in the field of regulatory authority and the issuing of recommendations and subject to government supervision in the field of control of access to the market, while they are more effective in the field of market control, through sending <b>formal</b> <b>notices</b> and through the arbitration authority and punitive power, without using the licences withdrawal, which remain under the authority of the government...|$|R

In this context, the term [...] "deficiency" [...] is a legal term of art, and is not necessarily equal to the amount of unpaid tax (although it usually is).

Ted Knight described Bright as a [...] "victim of [...] machine". After a <b>formal</b> <b>notice</b> of an extraordinary audit was published on 18 June, 32 councillors received notice on 27 June that the auditor deemed them liable to a surcharge of £126,947. The response of the councillors was to set up a 'Fighting Fund' in their defence, which was supported at its launch by the prominent actors Jill Gascoine, Frances de la Tour, Matthew Kelly, and Timothy West; the Labour group debated whether Mike Bright ought to be eligible for help from the fund.|$|E

The single reached no.6 in the UK and the Top 20 throughout much of Europe, {{as well as in}} Australia and the US. He also formed a band called The Spiritual Cowboys, releasing two albums with this group in the early 1990s. Lennox took time off from her career to have a baby and to consider a life after Eurythmics. Accordingly, the duo had very little communication with each other from 1991 to 1998. In 1991, Eurythmics' Greatest Hits collection was released, entering the UK album chart at No.1 and spending a total of 10 weeks at that position, as well as becoming a massive worldwide seller. New remixes of [...] "Sweet Dreams" [...] and [...] "Love Is a Stranger" [...] were also released as singles at this time.

After four weeks, the program could resume production, but only pre-taped episodes were to be televised for a period of six months. Once the six-month penalty period had ended, The Lone Shark was to resume the production of live episodes. The letters also stated that the producers could appeal the suspension. Sharky and Haffner decided not to appeal, because (coincidentally) both producers had more pressing personal issues that would have curbed production of The Lone Shark for at least the next six months, anyway.|$|R
