40|$|Going back {{in history}} {{it was found}} that {{traditionally}} pilot age around Britain was organized by entrepreneurial mariners,offering their services. This little group soon banded in brother hood of pilots,each group carving out there area. This was the birth of pilot age. Although at first it was an independent group, the system was enriched in the first Pilot age act in the last century. Through {{the turn of the century}} with advanced science and technology, so has the organization experienced rapid transformation performing to its highest capacity excelling in the duties, which are to be performed. There are at least three categories of pilots, which are as follows, - Deep sea or coastal pilot : assist ships between ports and areas - Outer or sea pilot : conduct ship from sea to port or vice versa - Inner or river canal and <b>dock</b> <b>pilot</b> : handle vessels in estuaries, river and canals It should be noted that there are variations to these categories according to the geographical location, economical and commercial environment. The main task of a pilot boat is to transfer the pilot to the required vessel in good condition. So that he can proceed in his duties in an efficient manner...|$|E

The Esmeralda II broke down and was abandoned by Hudson. In the first helicopter rescue of river runners in the Grand Canyon, Hudson and his son Edward were helicoptered out of the canyon while Dock completed the cruise in the Chris-Craft. The next river trip in Grand Canyon, almost a month later, discovered the Esmeralda II, fixed her, {{and were able to}} motor her {{through the rest of the}} Canyon. Hudson donated the Esmeralda II to the National Park Service where the boat is preserved to this day. Just after completing the 1950 cruise, Dock and Mag joined Moulton Fulmer for a dory run of the Yampa River.|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 996 {{disintegration}} stars were prong-counted in two 100 micron llford K. 2 emulsions from the dosimeter of the <b>Docking</b> <b>Pilot</b> on Apollo-Soyuz. The change of {{slope of the}} distribution at a prong number of about 6 or 7 indicates 219 stars as originating in gelatin.

The quoted values {{do not include the}} dose contribution from star-produced neutrons since neutrons do not leave visible prongs in emulsion. Nuclear theory, in good agreement with measurements of galactic radiation in the earth's atmosphere, indicates that the dose equivalent from neutrons is about equal to the one from all ionizing secondaries of stars.

50|$|After he was {{restored}} to flight status, Slayton was selected in February 1973 as <b>docking</b> module <b>pilot</b> for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, a docking between an American Apollo spacecraft and a Soviet Soyuz spacecraft. The American crew immediately began an intensive two-year training program, which included learning the Russian language and making frequent {{trips to the}} USSR, where astronauts trained for weeks at Star City, the cosmonaut training center near Moscow. Slayton resigned as Director of Flight Crew Operations in February 1974.|$|R
5000|$|NASA - Deke Slayton {{was one of}} the {{original}} NASA Mercury Seven astronauts, and became NASA's first Chief of the Astronaut Office. He served as NASA's Director of Flight Crew Operations, making him responsible for crew assignments at NASA from November 1963 until March 1972. At that time he was granted medical clearance to fly, and was assigned as the <b>docking</b> module <b>pilot</b> of the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, at age 51 becoming the oldest person to fly in space at the time.|$|R
50|$|Having been honourably {{discharged}} from the army, he joined the merchant fleet for a year long training as a radio officer. With the war by now drawing to a close, he went to sea {{in a variety of}} ships. Shortly after, with his first class Marconi certificate, he was sailing to the far east as Chief Radio Officer in the Blue Funnel liner Titan. However, without any prospect for further promotion, his career was stalled when he resigned to take up employment in the Union Castle Line as an ordinary seaman sailing aboard their cargo liner Dromore Castle, mostly between the USA and South Africa till he was promoted Bosun. Subsequently he sat his certificates as a Watch Officer and then as Master whilst sailing with Glasgow tramp ships and then with liners of the Ellerman City Line. Whilst berthing in London's West India Docks, MacKenzie, as 2nd Officer of the City of Valencia on an inward voyage from South Africa, saw the wooden sailing ship Discovery. Inquiring of the <b>docking</b> <b>pilot,</b> his enthusiasm was fired; immediately he went aboard, seeking employment for her forthcoming voyage of scientific research and exploration in Antarctica. Shortly after, he was appointed as the ship's Chief Officer when the City Line granted him 'leave of absence with full promotion'.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{not making}} a Mercury flight, Slayton stayed with the manned space program, as Director of Flight Crew Operations through the Gemini and Apollo programs, {{responsible}} for crew selection and training. In an effort to conquer his fibrillation, he gave up cigarettes and coffee, and placed himself on an intensive exercise and nutrition program. In July 1970, it ceased and he was returned to flight status, and flew on the last Apollo spacecraft in July 1975 as <b>docking</b> module <b>pilot</b> on the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project flight. He left NASA in February 1982.|$|R

5000|$|Once docked at Tiangong 1, {{the three}} crew members {{conducted}} space medicine and technological experiments and other scientific endeavours. Nie Haisheng was mission commander, overseeing <b>docking</b> procedures, and <b>pilot</b> Zhang Xiaoguang {{was in charge}} of rendezvous and docking. Wang Yaping conducted the scientific experiments and taught a physics lesson to Chinese students by live television broadcast. [...] On 23 June Shenzhou 10 undocked from the station and performed a manual re-docking.|$|R
50|$|Commander Jack Lousma {{previously}} flew as Pilot of {{the second}} Skylab crew, staying aboard the space station for 59 days from July to September 1973. Lousma had previously been selected in 1978 as Pilot for STS-2, which was then scheduled as a Skylab reboost mission. When delays in the Shuttle's development prevented Columbia from being launched in time to rendezvous with Skylab in 1979, STS-2 Commander Fred Haise retired from NASA and Lousma was then moved up as Commander of STS-3. Lousma also served on the support crews for Apollo 9, 10 and 13; he was the capsule communicator {{during the time of}} the latter mission's near-disastrous accident. He was also selected as backup <b>Docking</b> Module <b>Pilot</b> for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project in 1975.|$|R
5000|$|Rauschenbach later linked his {{interest}} to visual art {{with the problems}} of docking spacecraft. During <b>docking</b> operation, <b>pilot</b> could see the other spacecraft only on a TV screen. Does it render real objects good enough, wondered Rauschenbach, to bet the lives of two crews on a flat electronic image? This led him to study perspective and human perception of flat images. This applied problem transformed into general interest in humanities: [...] "Art and art studies, faith and religion live forever, and the man is always anxious to step further into the deep of it" [...] ("искусство и искусствознание, вера и религия существуют вечно, и в человеке всегда живет и будет жить какое-то беспокойство, желание проникнуть как можно глубже в сущность всего этого").|$|R
5000|$|The Pilot is {{responsible}} for maneuvering the ship, including navigating around objects, aligning the ship towards a target beacon, evasive maneuvers during combat and repair yard <b>docking.</b> Though the <b>Pilot</b> can fly in first-person perspective, {{it is one of}} only two that have exterior view modes as part of their role (the other being the Weapons Specialist). It {{is important to note that}} any member of the crew can fly the ship so long as the ship's helm is unoccupied.|$|R
50|$|After joining NASA, Slayton was {{selected}} to pilot the second U.S. manned orbital spaceflight, but was grounded in 1962 by atrial fibrillation, an irregular heart rhythm. He then served as NASA's Director of Flight Crew Operations, making him responsible for crew assignments at NASA from November 1963 until March 1972. At that time he was granted medical clearance to fly, and was assigned as the <b>docking</b> module <b>pilot</b> of the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, at age 51 becoming the oldest person to fly in space at the time.
