40|$|Intellectual {{property}} is increasingly a misnomer since {{the right to}} exclude is the defining characteristic of property and incentives to engage in inventive and creative activity are increasingly being granted {{in the form of}} liability rights (which allow the <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to collect a royalty from users) rather than property rights (which allow the <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to exclude others from using the invention or creation). Much of this recent reorientation in the direction of liability rules arises from a concern over holdout or monopoly power in intellectual property. The debate over whether liability rules or property rules are preferable for intellectual property has focused too narrowly on the benefits and costs of allowing the right to exclude, which is only one stick in the potential bundle of rights. Each stick in the bundle interacts with other sticks to affect both the rewards of engaging in inventive and creative activity and the social costs attributable to the grant of the rights. Sometimes, the optimal solution is to allow the exercise of other market-power-conferring rights but to remove the right to exclude. Administrability of a liability-rights-oriented regime should not be a major concern, since liability rules usually result in private bargaining rather than judicial or administrative rate setting...|$|E

40|$|A presente dissertação trata do direito de preferência para a celebração de negócios jurídicos, em geral translatícios de propriedade, que não encontra definição expressa no Código Civil, muito embora diversos dispositivos legais aludam ao referido direito. Na medida em que limita a liberdade contratual do vinculado à prelação, no tocante à escolha do outro contraente, a preferência, de origem legal ou negocial, atribui ao sujeito ativo da relação prelatícia o direito de ser preferido. Para tal, exige-se que o vinculado à preferência tenha decidido, de maneira livre e inequívoca, celebrar um contrato preferível, e que a sua intenção se tenha materializado, com a presença de um terceiro efetivamente interessado em com ele contratar. Constituído o direito do preferente, o que em geral chega a seu conhecimento por meio de notificação extrajudicial remetida pelo obrigado à prelação, pode aquele manifestar interesse em preferir, ou não. No primeiro caso, nasce na esfera jurídica do vinculado à prelação o dever de com ele contratar, nos mesmos termos e condições ajustados com terceiro. Dever este cuja violação, a depender da eficácia, real ou obrigacional, da preferência, possibilitará ao sujeito ativo perseguir não só as perdas e danos por ele eventualmente sofridas em decorrência do desrespeito a seu direito, como também, cumulativamente, lhe facultará exigir o cumprimento específico da obrigação. Neste último caso, o negócio jurídico celebrado entre o obrigado à preferência e terceiro será, perante o preferente, inoponível. This thesis {{examines}} {{rights of}} first refusal {{to enter into}} a business transaction, generally involving the transfer of property. Rights of first refusal are not specifically defined in the Brazilian Civil Code, although various provisions of the Code allude to them. While on one hand rights of first refusal, whether legal or contractual in origin, limit the contractual freedom of the obligor, by restricting his choice of contracting parties, on the other they generate a preference or option in the right holder to conclude the transaction contemplated by the right. Before this preference or option can be exercised, however, the obligor must have formed the free and unmistakable intention to enter into the business transaction subject to the right of first refusal, and this intention must be made manifest in relation to a third party that is effectively interested in making the contract. The <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of first refusal usually becomes aware that the right has become exercisable by notice sent by the obligor, and in response the right holder is required to state whether the right will be exercised or not. If the right is exercised, a new obligation arises {{on the part of the}} obligor to enter into the transaction with the right holder, on the same terms and conditions agreed with the third party. Depending on whether the right of first refusal is personal or real in nature, violation of this obligation can give rise not only to the right to reparation of losses suffered as a consequence of the breach, but also the right to demand specific performance of the obligation, in which case any transaction made between the obligor and a third party will be unenforceable against the <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> of first refusal...|$|E

Lucas Ltd. v. Export Credits Guarantee Department, is bred by the juxtaposition of two subrogation rules. The right to subrogation, being in nature like restitution, entitles the <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> only to reimbursement and, under a contract of insurance, “the assured … shall be fully indemnified, but shall never be more than fully indemnified. ” The confusion that distribution of windfall profits in subrogation has brought to American and English courts derives from both the difficulty of the question and its rarity. Because insurance agreements are contracts of indemnity, the issue of which party is entitled to any possible excess once both the insurer and the insured have been indemnified has seldom been litigated. This comment will evaluate a subrogee’s right to recover more than it paid to the subrogor. The purpose of subrogation and insurance will be outlined, focusing on those few recent cases in England and the United States dealing with the profit-in-subrogation issue. Next, this Comment will examine the circumstances under which a windfall might accrue to the insurer and the possible justifications and consequences of such a windfall award. A flexible approach for courts confronted with allocating a windfall in an equitable subrogation suit will then be proposed. Finally the implications of choosing a flexible approach to windfalls in subrogation will be contrasted with the view that the windfall be awarded strictly to either the insured or the insurer...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{trade marks}} perform {{multiple}} functions taken up in a functional matrix. Amongst them the distinguishing function is invariable whilst the other functions are variable. A legal-historical and comparative investigation {{of the law of}} trade marks in the United Kingdom, the European Union, the U. S. A. and South Africa reveals that only certain trade mark functions have traditionally been afforded protection under law. This is mainly because of a historical resistance to accepting trade marks as property in the Anglo and American trade mark systems and the primacy of origin theory in the European Community trade mark system. The bedrock of South African trade mark law has been the trade mark law of the United Kingdom. The restrictions brought about by common law property theory have been carried over into the South African law of trade marks. The South African law of property is however derived from the civil law and not the common law. The historical break in continuity of the common law trade mark tradition {{as a consequence of the}} interposition of the European Union and the reception of EC trade mark law in the United Kingdom affords the opportunity for a theory of trade mark rights to be established in South Africa which is derived from concepts already present in South African law. The thesis proposes that the legal right to the trade mark in South African law is an independent subjective right of the kind proposed by Joubert. The legal object of this right is the trade mark. The entitlements of use of the <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> are the functions which the holder is entitled to have the trade mark perform. A range of values in which the property in a trade mark is to be found are associated with the functions. Unlawful impingement upon any function infringes the trade mark right.

It is due to this situation, {{the involvement of the}} public powers, in order to implement and develop of this right, must be promoted.   The application of the right {{to education}} to people that suffer disabilities has got a great degree of importance under The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, held in New York in December 2006. At that time the international community implications were really consolidated. This situation has changed dramatically with the economic crisis that we are suffering in recent times. This is the main reason for the present study, an appeal to implement and apply regulation about disabilities at University studies trough the reform of their statutes and by the increase of the level of the information and training of their workers, especially professors. The universalization of rights, such as education, faces difficulties in achieving its fullness as all holders differ with respect to other recipients of this right. The challenge of this work is to visualize the situation in a very specific environment, university education, and in a very precise context that is the Kingdom of Spain.

The interest of the above-mentioned Ruling {{lies in the fact}} that it affects the delimitation of the contents of the Freedom of Association, by determining the exact location of the right of unions to receive external counselling among those contents, while at the same time highlighting, in line with constant constitutional and judicial doctrine, that its fundamental nature does not imply the inexistence of limits to its exercise. The appeal for protection of fundamental rights against OPAEF was dismissed by the Ruling of the Social Justice Court No. 4 of Sevilla on 17 th February 2010. In conclusion, on integrating the right of trade unions to receive external assessment within the additional content of the right to Freedom of Association, the norm that is created is the one that delimits it, while also establishing the conditions under which it can be exercised. In any event, such conditions must be reasonable, since otherwise they would jeopardise the right, and in this case they are reasonable because they are justified on grounds of a productive nature, which determine that the presence of third parties in the enterprise must take place within the context of meetings of which the enterprise has been given due notice. Likewise, the enterprise must also be given notice of the assessor's attendance at those meetings by the union, since it is the <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>right.</b> Taking into account all the foregoing, the High Court of Justice of Andalucía (Sevilla) dismisses the appeal that has been filed, and concludes that the factors conditioning the exercise of this right do not breach the Freedom of Association. More specifically, the open or generic notification by the union regarding the presence of the assessor is unacceptable; similarly, the manifestation of this same figure can in no way be understood as satisfying the request of prior notification to the enterprise, as was the appellants’ intention, since the normative requirements must be complied with, and these state that prior notice of his or her attendance must be given at each meeting, and the enterprise should in turn have been notified of them...|$|E

A continuación examino la compatibilidad de la legítima con los derechos de herencia y de propiedad tal como vienen enunciados en la Constitución española. Propondré entonces dos posibles interpretaciones del enunciado constitucional que vincula ambos derechos y mostraré qué argumentos sustentan una y otra. Finalmente pongo de manifiesto la incoherencia de la legítima con una de las dos posibles interpretaciones del art. 33. 1 de la Constitución española y la dudosa compatibilidad con la otra al situar en una posición de privilegio a ciertos parientes del causante, o si se prefiere, en una posición de no derecho al propietario de los bienes.

Then, I will propose two ways of interpretation of the constitutional text in which both rights are linked, and I will try to show what their grounds are. Finally, I show the incoherence of forced hiership with one of the two possible interpretations of the Spanish Constitution, and the hard compatibility with the other one.
