By 1913, Argentina was the world's 10th wealthiest nation per capita.|$|E

5|$|Riemannian {{manifolds}} are manifolds whose tangent {{spaces are}} <b>endowed</b> <b>with</b> a suitable inner product. Derived therefrom, the Riemann curvature tensor encodes all curvatures of a manifold in one object, which finds applications in general relativity, for example, where the Einstein curvature tensor describes {{the matter and}} energy content of space-time. The tangent space of a Lie group can be given naturally {{the structure of a}} Lie algebra and can be used to classify compact Lie groups.|$|E
5|$|In 1857, Cayley {{introduced}} matrix notation, {{which allows}} for a harmonization and simplification of linear maps. Around the same time, Grassmann studied the barycentric calculus initiated by Möbius. He envisaged sets of abstract objects <b>endowed</b> <b>with</b> operations. In his work, the concepts of linear independence and dimension, as well as scalar products, are present. In fact, Grassmann's 1844 work exceeds the framework of vector spaces, since his consideration of multiplication led him to what are today called algebras. Peano {{was the first to}} give the modern definition of vector spaces and linear maps in 1888.|$|E

5|$|In {{physical}} terms the function is {{represented as a}} superposition of sine waves and the coefficients give information about the function's frequency spectrum. A complex-number form of Fourier series is also commonly used. The concrete formulae above are consequences of a more general mathematical duality called Pontryagin duality. Applied to the group R, it yields the classical Fourier transform; an application in physics are reciprocal lattices, where the underlying group is a finite-dimensional real vector space <b>endowed</b> <b>with</b> the additional datum of a lattice encoding positions of atoms in crystals.|$|E
5|$|Marble is {{the most}} {{significant}} mineral deposit of Romblon and {{is the most}} renowned product of the province.

Romblon marble is of very high quality and comes in shades of white, green, pink, red and black. The Mines and Geosciences Bureau has estimated that Romblon is <b>endowed</b> <b>with</b> about 150 million metric tons of marble. At current rates of extraction, the supply may last for three more centuries. Tablas Island is also believed to have vast reserves of marble.|$|E

5|$|The role of cavalry in {{the late}} army {{does not appear to}} have been greatly {{enhanced}} as compared with the army of the Principate. The evidence is that cavalry was much the same proportion of overall army numbers as in the 2ndcentury and that its tactical role and prestige remained similar. However, the cavalry of the Late Roman army was <b>endowed</b> <b>with</b> greater numbers of specialised units, such as extra-heavy shock cavalry (cataphractii and clibanarii) and mounted archers. During the later 4thcentury, the cavalry acquired a reputation for incompetence and cowardice for their role in three major battles. In contrast, the infantry retained its traditional reputation for excellence.|$|E
5|$|Under the Ayyubids, {{numerous}} Arab emirs {{held the}} post {{at any given}} time and were <b>endowed</b> <b>with</b> iqtaʿat. However, with the onset of Mamluk rule in Syria in 1260, it became a hereditary office consolidated by members of the Al Fadl dynasty, direct descendants of the Tayyid clan of Banu Jarrah. The office remained in the household of the Al Fadl emir, Isa ibn Muhanna, with occasional interruption, well into the early Ottoman era, during which Isa's descendants took over leadership of the Mawali tribe. Under the Ottomans, the role of the amir al-ʿarab appeared centered on providing camels to the state and guarding the Hajj pilgrim caravan in return for annual payments.|$|E
5|$|Vector {{spaces are}} the subject of linear algebra and are well {{characterized}} by their dimension, which, roughly speaking, specifies the number of independent directions in the space. Infinite-dimensional vector spaces arise naturally in mathematical analysis, as function spaces, whose vectors are functions. These vector spaces are generally <b>endowed</b> <b>with</b> additional structure, which may be a topology, allowing the consideration of issues of proximity and continuity. Among these topologies, those that are defined by a norm or inner product are more commonly used, as having a notion of distance between two vectors. This is particularly the case of Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces, which are fundamental in mathematical analysis.|$|E
