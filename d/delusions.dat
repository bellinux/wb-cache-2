5|$|In What Starts Wars: Intentional <b>Delusions</b> Stratton {{presented}} nations, themselves {{collections of}} people, as triggering war from several <b>delusions.</b> Three of those <b>delusions</b> held by citizens were {{that their own}} country was a paragon of peace, that its arms were only to defend the land, and that when it fought, it fought only for what was right. Blaming the enemy rounded out this list justifying war. Stratton believed and stated people could be freed of these <b>delusions</b> {{and that there was}} no will to war integral to human nature. He saw both the need for and the ways to eliminate war in individuals and in their ways, and not in abstract or innate traits. Florence Finch Kelly, reviewing the book for the New York Times, saw Stratton's placing of both the blame and the responsibility on persons, of identifying the roots of war in the psyches of the men and women his readers, as an action likely to discomfit those readers.|$|E

50|$|An insane <b>delusion</b> is {{distinct}} from testamentary capacity. A testator might be suffering from an insane <b>delusion</b> but otherwise possess the requisite capacity to make a will. Similarly, an insane <b>delusion</b> {{is distinct}} from a mere mistake. If suffering from an insane <b>delusion,</b> a testator {{is not subject to}} change his or her mind regarding the <b>delusion</b> if presented with contrary evidence, whereas a mistake is capable of being corrected if the testator is told the truth. Additionally, while an insane <b>delusion</b> may cause portions of a will to fail, most courts will not reform or invalidate a will because of a mistake unless it was the result of fraud.|$|R

5|$|Psychotic {{symptoms}} may {{be present}} in several other mental disorders, including bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, drug intoxication, and drug-induced psychosis. <b>Delusions</b> ("non-bizarre") are also present in delusional disorder, and social withdrawal in social anxiety disorder, avoidant personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder has symptoms that are similar but less severe than those of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia occurs along with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) considerably more often than {{could be explained by}} chance, although {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish obsessions that occur in OCD from the <b>delusions</b> of schizophrenia. A few people withdrawing from benzodiazepines experience a severe withdrawal syndrome which may last a long time. It can resemble schizophrenia and be misdiagnosed as such.|$|E
5|$|A {{description}} of thought content would describe a patient's <b>delusions,</b> overvalued ideas, obsessions, phobias and preoccupations. Abnormalities of thought content are established by exploring individuals' thoughts in an open-ended conversational manner {{with regard to}} their intensity, salience, the emotions associated with the thoughts, {{the extent to which the}} thoughts are experienced as one's own and under one's control, and the degree of belief or conviction associated with the thoughts.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT – Background and Objectives: Bizarre hypochondriacal <b>delusion</b> is an im-portant {{content of}} <b>delusion</b> of {{pregnancy}} during post-partum period. Methods: Here we report two cases with postpartum <b>delusion</b> of pregnancy; one with pre-existing schizophrenia {{and another one}} with family history of pseudocyesis and schizoaffective disorder but with no pre-existing psychiatric illness. Results: Nosological, phenomenological and aetiological issues are discussed. In the context of novel deficit-and motivational theories of <b>delusion</b> formation we provide an in-tegrated view of the reported cases. Conclusions: The complexity of the <b>delusion</b> of pregnancy {{should be considered in}} the treatment planning-particularly in the post-partum period...|$|R

50|$|The Fregoli <b>delusion</b> is classed {{both as a}} monothematic <b>delusion,</b> {{since it}} only {{encompasses}} one delusional topic, and as a delusional misidentification syndrome (DMS), a class of delusional beliefs that involves misidentifying people, places, or objects. Like Capgras <b>delusion,</b> psychiatrists believe it is related to a breakdown in normal face perception.|$|R
5|$|Individuals with {{schizophrenia}} {{may experience}} hallucinations (most reported are hearing voices), <b>delusions</b> (often bizarre or persecutory in nature), and disorganized thinking and speech. The last may range from loss of train of thought, to sentences only loosely connected in meaning, to speech {{that is not}} understandable known as word salad. Social withdrawal, sloppiness of dress and hygiene, and loss of motivation and judgment are all common in schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|The {{popularity}} of Mackay's tale {{has continued to}} this day, with new editions of Extraordinary Popular <b>Delusions</b> appearing regularly, with introductions by writers such as financier Bernard Baruch (1932), financial writer Andrew Tobias (1980), psychologist David J. Schneider (1993), and Michael Lewis (2008). At least six editions are currently in print.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion-induced {{psychosis}} {{may develop}} in select populations, or worsen a pre-existing psychotic syndrome. Symptoms may include <b>delusions,</b> hallucinations, paranoia, and confusion. In most cases these symptoms {{can be reduced}} or eliminated by reducing the dose, ceasing treatment or adding antipsychotic medication. However, adding a benzodiazepine to treat psychosis, instead of an antipsychotic, may become a valid alternative according to the model of amphetamine-induced psychosis. Psychotic symptoms are associated with factors such as higher doses of bupropion, a history of bipolar disorder or psychosis, concomitant medications, for example, lithium or benzodiazepines, old age, or substance abuse.|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} case of a 35 year old women who {{developed}} a complex paranoid <b>delusion</b> during the course of clomiphene treatment für ovulation. The psychopathology was remarkable, because after a short hypomanic period the patient was without severe cognitive disturbance but struggled with a complex monothematic <b>delusion.</b> The <b>delusion</b> vanished {{in the course of a}} combination treatment with olanzapine a cognitive behavioral therapy. We could not entirely rule out the possibility of an endogenous psychiatric disease but nevertheless we encountered an unusual monothematic <b>delusion</b> which showed a strong temporal correlation with the intake of clomiphene. We provide some speculation about underlying neurobiological mechanisms on the basis of the dopamine theory of <b>delusion...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Insane <b>delusion</b> is {{the legal}} term {{of art in the}} common law {{tradition}} used to describe a false conception of reality that a testator of a will adheres to against all reason and evidence to the contrary. A will made by a testator suffering from an insane <b>delusion</b> that affects the provisions made in the will may fail in whole or in part. Only the portion of the will caused by the insane <b>delusion</b> fails, including potentially the entire will. Will contests often involve claims that the testator was suffering from an insane <b>delusion.</b>|$|R

Between him being suspected, more New Gen murders occurring, and Shogun supposedly targeting him, Takumi finds himself experiencing hallucinations and paranoia, and is unsure of what is real and who he can trust. In one of his <b>delusions,</b> Shogun appears as an old man in a wheelchair and tells him that more people will die unless he wakes up.|$|E
5|$|During {{his final}} years, and {{especially}} {{after the death of}} Hephaestion, Alexander began to exhibit signs of megalomania and paranoia. His extraordinary achievements, coupled with his own ineffable sense of destiny and the flattery of his companions, may have combined to produce this effect.

5|$|In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association {{released}} the fifth {{edition of the}} DSM (DSM-5). To be diagnosed with schizophrenia, two diagnostic criteria have to be met {{over much of the}} time of a period of at least one month, with a significant impact on social or occupational functioning for at least six months. The person had to be suffering from <b>delusions,</b> hallucinations, or disorganized speech. A second symptom could be negative symptoms, or severely disorganized or catatonic behaviour. The definition of schizophrenia remained essentially the same as that specified by the 2000 version of DSM (DSM-IV-TR), but DSM-5 makes a number of changes.|$|E
40|$|<b>Delusion</b> is {{certainly}} {{one of the most important}} and intriguing phenomena in psychopathology. Knowledge about its causal mechanisms and clinical consequences is still rather insufficient. Lately, emphasis has been laid upon the so-called dimensions of <b>delusion</b> (conviction, extension, bizarreness, disorganization, pression, affective response and action upon <b>delusion).</b> This study attempted to explore these dimensions, as well as the Jaspersian characteristics, in 24 highly delusional patients. Besides, delusional patients (n = 83) were compared to non-delusional ones (n = 111) in terms of demographic, clinical and cognitive variables. A better cognitive performance was found in the delusional group. The abnormal behavior linked to <b>delusion</b> correlated both to affective response and to the degree of conviction. Affective response to <b>delusion</b> and conviction were also associated to each other...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I discuss the {{scientific}} respectability of <b>delusion</b> as a psychiatric category. First, I present the essentialist {{objection to the}} natural kindhood of psychiatric categories, as well as non-essentialism about natural kinds {{as a response to}} that objection. Second, I present a nuanced classification of kinds of kinds. Third, drawing on the claim that the attribution of <b>delusion</b> relies on a folk psychological underpinning, I present the mind-dependence objection to the natural kind status of <b>delusion.</b> Finally, I argue that even if <b>delusion</b> as a generic kind stands little chance of being vindicated as a non-essentialist natural kind, we stand to gain from a natural kind methodology regarding subtypes of <b>delusion</b> for which there is evidence of genuine causal signatures and mechanisms...|$|R
50|$|In {{collaboration}} with William Hirstein, Ramachandran published {{a paper in}} 1997 in which he presented a theory regarding the neural basis of Capgras <b>delusion,</b> a <b>delusion</b> in which family members and other loved ones {{are thought to be}} replaced by impostors. Prior to Ramachandran's 1997 paper, psychologists HD Ellis and Andy Young had theorized that Capgras <b>delusion</b> was created by a neurological disconnection between facial recognition and emotional arousal. Based on the evaluation of a single subject, who did not manifest complex psychological symptoms, Ramachandran and Hirstein hypothesized that Capgras <b>delusion</b> involves memory management problems, in addition to a disconnection between facial recognition and emotional arousal. According to their theory, a person suffering from Capgras <b>delusion</b> loses the ability to manage memories effectively.|$|R
5|$|Modern {{feminism}} {{challenges the}} essentialist view of gender as biologically intrinsic. For example, Anne Fausto-Sterling's book, Myths of Gender, explores the assumptions embodied in scientific research that support a biologically essentialist view of gender. In <b>Delusions</b> of Gender, Cordelia Fine disputes {{scientific evidence that}} {{suggests that there is}} an innate biological difference between men's and women's minds, asserting instead that cultural and societal beliefs are the reason for differences between individuals that are commonly perceived as sex differences.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia {{is often}} {{described}} in terms of positive and negative (or deficit) symptoms. Positive symptoms are those that most individuals do not normally experience, but are present in people with schizophrenia. They can include <b>delusions,</b> disordered thoughts and speech, and tactile, auditory, visual, olfactory and gustatory hallucinations, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis. Hallucinations are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme. Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication.|$|E
5|$|The 1637 {{event was}} popularized in 1841 {{by the book}} Extraordinary Popular <b>Delusions</b> and the Madness of Crowds, written by British {{journalist}} Charles Mackay. At one point 12 acres (5 ha) of land were offered for a Semper Augustus bulb. Mackay claims that many such investors were ruined by the fall in prices, and Dutch commerce suffered a severe shock. Although Mackay's book is a classic, his account is contested. Many modern scholars feel that the mania was not as extraordinary as Mackay described and argue that not enough price data are available to prove that a tulip bulb bubble actually occurred.|$|E

5|$|The person's {{understanding}} {{of his or}} her mental illness is evaluated by exploring his or her explanatory account of the problem, and {{understanding of}} the treatment options. In this context, insight can be said to have three components: recognition that one has a mental illness, compliance with treatment, and the ability to re-label unusual mental events (such as <b>delusions</b> and hallucinations) as pathological. As insight is on a continuum, the clinician should not describe it as simply present or absent, but should report the patient's explanatory account descriptively.|$|E
5|$|There are {{potential}} problems when the MSE is applied in a cross-cultural context, when the clinician and patient are from different cultural backgrounds. For example, the patient's culture might have different norms for appearance, behavior and display of emotions. Culturally normative spiritual and religious beliefs {{need to be}} distinguished from <b>delusions</b> and hallucinations - these may seem similar to one who does not understand that they have different roots. Cognitive assessment must also take the patient's language and educational background into account. Clinician's racial bias is another potential confounder.|$|E
5|$|At {{therapeutic}} doses, amphetamine causes {{emotional and}} cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. It induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. Larger doses of amphetamine may impair cognitive function and induce rapid muscle breakdown. Drug addiction {{is a serious}} risk with large recreational doses but is unlikely to arise from typical long-term medical use at therapeutic doses. Very high doses can result in psychosis (e.g., <b>delusions</b> and paranoia) which rarely occurs at therapeutic doses even during long-term use. Recreational doses are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses and carry a far greater risk of serious side effects.|$|E

40|$|People {{experiencing}} the Capgras <b>delusion</b> claim that others, usually those quite close emotionally, {{have been replaced}} by near-identical impostors. Ellis & Young suggested in 1990 that the Capgras <b>delusion</b> results from damage to a neurological system involved in orienting responses to seen faces based on their personal significance. This hypothesis predicts that people suffering the Capgras <b>delusion</b> will be hyporesponsive to familiar faces. We tested this prediction in five people with Capgras <b>delusion.</b> Comparison data were obtained from five middle-aged members of the general public, and a psychiatric control group of five patients taking similar anti-psychotic medication. Capgras <b>delusion</b> patients did not reveal autonomic discrimination between familiar and unfamiliar faces, but orienting responses to auditory tones were normal in magnitude and rate of initial habituation, showing that the hyporesponsiveness is circumscribed...|$|R
