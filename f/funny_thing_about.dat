Many critics have noted {{similarities}} between [...] "Monday" [...] and the 1993 comedy film Groundhog Day. Vince Gilligan and John Shiban, {{the writers of}} the episode, however, credit an episode of The Twilight Zone entitled [...] "Shadow Play" [...] (1961). Gilligan later noted: [...] "The <b>funny</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> 'Monday' is people seemed to really like it a lot, but people always sorta [...] smiled and said you're sort of ripping off Groundhog Day aren't you? [...] And I'd say, we're not ripping off Groundhog Day, we're ripping off The Twilight Zone." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{pilot was}} {{considered}} {{to have a good}} chance of being picked up, but ultimately the CW passed on the show. Discussing the excitement surrounding the project, Lou Diamond Phillips said, [...] "The <b>funny</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> the Aquaman project is that there's so much buzz about it already. Which is amazing, I mean you don't usually get that with a pilot, because they're sort of sight unseen." [...] There were reports of two WB pilots in contention for the new CW network, one being Aquaman, which was a frontrunner. On May 18, 2006, when The CW announced its fall lineup Aquaman was not on the list. Dawn Ostroff, The CW's president of entertainment, stated that it was still a midseason contender.|$|E

The Office of Strategic Influence was a highly secret {{organization}} set up three weeks after the September 11 attacks. Part of its mission was to spread misinformation and plant false news items in the media in order to [...] "influence {{the hearts and minds of}} the opposition." [...] After The New York Times ran a story on the Office in February 2002, it was forced to shut, although many of its operations were later transferred to the Information Operations Task Force. [...] "The <b>funny</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> it was the government and administration was saying it's so embarrassing that they had to name it the 'Office of Strategic Influence,' we couldn't just put it in a room in the Pentagon and name it whatever the room number is," [...] Moore said. [...] "Someone decided to be really creative about it and name it what it really is." ...|$|E

500|$|D'Angelo was {{dissatisfied}} with the direction of R and soul music when conceiving the album. In an interview for Jet, he said that [...] "the term R doesn't mean {{what it used to}} mean. R is pop, that's the new word for R" [...] He also found contemporary R to be [...] "a joke", adding that [...] "the <b>funny</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> it is that the people making this shit are dead serious about the stuff they're making. It's sad—they've turned black music into a club thing." [...] In the liner notes for Voodoo, Saul Williams examined the album's concept and echoes D'Angelo's dissatisfaction with the mainstream direction of contemporary R/soul and hip hop, noting a lack of artistic integrity in the two music genres. In an interview for Ebony, D'Angelo said of his role and influences for Voodoo, [...] "I consider myself very respectful of the masters who came before. In some ways, I feel a responsibility to continue and take the cue from what they were doing musically and vibe on it. That's what I want to do. But I want to do it for this time and this generation". In the album's EPK, D'Angelo said that Voodoo is [...] "like a funk album. The natural progression of soul, the next step to soul is funk".|$|E

2500|$|Austin Nichols portrays Julian Baker, Peyton's ex-boyfriend from Los Angeles. [...] "The <b>funny</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> Austin is {{that there}} was {{initially}} much resistance from the folks who have to OK our casting choices. Which is not rare, by the way," [...] commented Schwahn. [...] "When that happens, I {{pick up the phone and}} try to rationalize with everyone, or pout or bitch or whine and eventually I get my way (and probably get called an ass****) and this leads to Austin Nichols killing it as Julian, just as I suspected he would in the first place." [...] Schwahn added, [...] "This is not to say that there aren't good people and good allies working on my show at both the studio and network, just that the fans would be surprised at how things work behind the scenes." [...] A regular from season 7, Julian initially comes to Tree Hill to win Peyton back. He offers to produce a film based on Lucas's first book. At first, Peyton does not reveal to Lucas that Julian is her ex-boyfriend, but she is forced to do so when the plans of the movie take shape. Brooke rebuffs his advances until Peyton gives her blessing when she sees that Brooke has a serious interest in Julian. After Brooke opens up to Julian, they begin a relationship.|$|E

2500|$|The album's {{official}} cover (standard version) {{was revealed}} on February 29, 2012. The cover art {{was shot in}} January {{of the same year}} by Steven Gomillion and Dennis Leupold of the photography team, Gomillion and Leupold. On the album cover, a light shines down on Brown, who poses against a blue backdrop, dressed in a blue [...] "sleek, slim-fitting suit with a skinny tie and thick black framed glasses", while the word [...] "Fortune" [...] appears behind him in different languages. Brown and his art director Courtney Walter {{came up with the idea}} of using hieroglyphics for the album's title. In an interview by telephone with Erik Parker of CBS Local, Gomillion said Brown [...] "knew before the last album came out what this one would look like. He thinks so far ahead". Regarding the use of the color blue, Gomillion said [...] "The <b>funny</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> that blue is it basically just happened. It matched the suit and it gives a kind of futuristic vibe. You'll see blue throughout the [...] packaging". Sarah Brotherton of MTV News wrote that the cover shows [...] "a more mature, sleek side" [...] to Brown. Becky Bain of Idolator noted that Brown [...] "seems to have finally dropped his beloved graffiti imagery and is going for a futuristic vibe". A reviewer for Rap-Up described it as a [...] "slick cover". Alex Loinaz of E! Online compared Brown's look to that of actors Keanu Reeves in The Matrix films, and Colin Firth in A Single Man (2009).|$|E
