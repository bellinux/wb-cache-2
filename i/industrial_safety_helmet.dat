40|$|Introduction: Work-related {{traumatic}} brain injury (TBI) caused by falls is a catastrophic event that leads to disabilities and high socio-medical costs. This study aimed to measure {{the magnitude of the}} preventive effect of <b>safety</b> <b>helmets</b> on clinical outcomes and to compare the effect across different heights of fall. Methods: We collected a nationwide, prospective database of work-related injury patients who visited the 10 emergency departments between July 2010 and October 2012. All of the adult patients who experienced work-related fall injuries were eligible, excluding cases with unknown <b>safety</b> <b>helmet</b> use and height of fall. Primary and secondary endpoints were intracranial injury and in-hospital mortality. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of <b>safety</b> <b>helmet</b> use and height of fall for study outcomes, and adjusted for any potential confounders. Results: A total of 1298 patients who suffered from work-related fall injuries were enrolled. The industrial or construction area was the most common place of fall injury occurrence, and 45. 0 % were wearing <b>safety</b> <b>helmets</b> at the time of fall injuries. The <b>safety</b> <b>helmet</b> group was less likely to have intracranial injury comparing with the no <b>safety</b> <b>helmet</b> group (the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) (95 % confidence interval (CI)) : 0. 42 (0. 24 – 0. 73)), however, there was no statistical difference of in-hospital mortality between two groups (the adjusted ORs (95 % CI) : 0. 83 (0. 34 – 2. 03). In the interaction analysis, preventive effects of <b>safety</b> <b>helmet</b> on intracranial injury were significant within 4 m height of fall. Conclusions: A <b>safety</b> <b>helmet</b> is associated with prevention of intracranial injury resulting from work-related fall and the effect is preserved within 4 m height of fall. Therefore, wearing a <b>safety</b> <b>helmet</b> can be an intervention for protecting fall-related intracranial injury in the workplace...|$|R

However, statistic of road accidents by the Royal Malaysian Police reveals that motorcyclists {{are found to be}} the most vulnerable road users as compared to users of other vehicles. This is {{due to the lack of}} safety protection and instability of motorcycles themselves. Despite the usefulness and effectiveness of <b>safety</b> <b>helmet</b> to prevent head injuries, majority of motorcycle users do not wear and fasten their helmet properly. This study presents a new approach in enhancing the safety of motorcycle riders through proper usage of <b>safety</b> <b>helmet.</b> The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was adopted in predicting the behavioral intention to use <b>Safety</b> <b>Helmet</b> Reminder (SHR) system towards a more proper helmet usage among motorcyclists.

40|$|Involvement {{of motor}} bicycle {{accidents}} as a motor bicycle occupant {{is one of}} the most common causes of serious head injuries. Use of motorcycle <b>safety</b> <b>helmets</b> has been found to be effective in reducing injuries in accidents. The protective effect of motorcycle <b>safety</b> <b>helmets</b> has been well documented in motor bicycle safety literature. Beginning from 2011, wearing <b>safety</b> <b>helmets</b> for all types of motor bicycles are mandatory in Sri Lanka. Previously these regulations were not valid for motor bicycle with low engine capacity, such as moped motor bicycles. Even though wearing bicycle <b>safety</b> <b>helmets</b> are now required for all motorcycle occupants in Sri Lanka, many child motorcycle passengers do not wear them. The objectives of this study are to investigate the effectiveness of helmet laws in Sri Lanka and the relationship between motor bicycle accidents and motorcycle helmet use. A detailed literature review on motor bicycle safety including the effectiveness of legislation and injury-prevention strategies is carried out in order to understand the current state of research on this area. Those studies indicated that children who wear helmets experienced fewer head injuries and decreased injury severity. However, there are various reasons to limited use of motorcycle helmets while some people simply do not use or reluctant to use helmets. The rate of motorcycle helmet use appeared to be varying from one geographic location to other. Community-wide helmet-promotion campaigns combined with legislation are most successful in increasing helmet use and decreasing injury. A large number of studies were based on comparisons of <b>safety</b> <b>helmet</b> use versus not use among the accidents involving motor bicycle occupants. Also, some of studies investigated characteristics and injury severity of accidents involving motor bicycle occupants. The objectives of this study are to investigate motorcycle helmet use rates and the motorcycle accidents. A representative sample of motorcycles was observed using the mobile observation method that covered all roads throughout Sri Lanka during 2011 and 2012. Roads in Sri Lanka classified as A, B, C, and D-class roads and collected data were representative samples of all these classes. In mobile observation method, while traveling inside vehicle head-on motorcycles were observed and recorded which included number of occupants in the motorcycle and the helmet usage of all the occupants. The accident severity data were obtained from the Police headquarters, Baduraliya Police Station, and Homagama Police Station while injury severity data were obtained from the, Baduraliya Hospital and Homagama Hospital. According to observational data, the average motorcycle helmet use rate was 81 %. Motorcycle operators and pillions in town areas travelling on A-class roads were more likely to wear <b>safety</b> <b>helmets.</b> While the <b>safety</b> <b>helmet</b> usage was low among riders and pillions traveling in rural areas on C & D-class roadways.

The prevalence compliance to <b>safety</b> <b>helmet,</b> mask, eye protection gear; ear-plugs and safety boots was 67. 1 %, 35. 3 %, 32. 0 %, 41. 1 % and 99. 2 % respectively. There was a significant relationship (p< 0. 05) between the compliance to <b>safety</b> <b>helmets</b> with type of work being done and for ear-plugs, relationship with compliance were significantly associated with type of work done, duration of use and fit-testing. Findings of this study also supports the hypothesis that compliance was associated with unimpeded movement, unaffected productivity and unhindered work task (p< 0. 05). Age and tenure in service have no significant relationship with compliance. Knowledge on safety and health issues were shown to relate to compliance with <b>safety</b> <b>helmets</b> (p< 0. 01).

40|$|Background: Despite {{the recent}} {{efforts to prevent}} {{industrial}} accidents in the Republic of Korea, the industrial accident rate has not improved much. <b>Industrial</b> <b>safety</b> policies and safety management are also known to be inefficient. This study focused on dynamic characteristics of <b>industrial</b> <b>safety</b> systems and their effects on safety performance in the Republic of Korea. Such dynamic characteristics are particularly important for restructuring of the <b>industrial</b> <b>safety</b> system. Methods: The effects of damping and elastic characteristics of the <b>industrial</b> <b>safety</b> system model on safety performance were examined and feedback control performance was explained in view of cost and benefit. The implications on safety policies of restructuring the <b>industrial</b> <b>safety</b> system were also explored. Results: A strong correlation between the safety budget and the industrial accident rate enabled modeling of an <b>industrial</b> <b>safety</b> system with these variables as the input and the output, respectively. A more effective and efficient <b>industrial</b> <b>safety</b> system could be realized by having weaker elastic characteristics and stronger damping characteristics in it. A substantial decrease in total social cost is expected as the <b>industrial</b> <b>safety</b> system is restructured accordingly. Conclusion: A simple feedback control with proportional–integral action is effective in prevention of industrial accidents. Securing {{a lower level of}} elastic industrial accident-driving energy appears to have dominant effects on the control performance compared with the damping effort to dissipate such energy. More attention needs to be directed towards physical and social feedbacks that have prolonged cumulative effects.
