5|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{would have}} used optical interferometry to accomplish these and other scientific goals. This technique collects light with multiple mirrors (in SIM's case, two) which is combined to make an <b>interference</b> <b>pattern</b> which can be very precisely measured.|$|E
5|$|Electron {{holography}} is an {{imaging technique}} that photographically records the electron <b>interference</b> <b>pattern</b> of an object, {{which is then}} reconstructed to yield a greatly magnified image of the original object. This technique was developed to enable greater resolution in electron microscopy than is possible using conventional imaging techniques. The resolution of conventional electron microscopy is not limited by electron wavelength, but by the large aberrations of electron lenses.|$|E

40|$|Beam {{incidence}} {{conditions in}} the formation of two-, three- and four-beam laser <b>interference</b> <b>patterns</b> are presented and studied in this paper. In a laser interference lithography (LIL) process, it is of importance to determine and control beam incidence conditions based on the analysis of laser <b>interference</b> <b>patterns</b> for system calibration as any slight change of incident angles or intensities of beams will introduce significant variations of periods and contrasts of <b>interference</b> <b>patterns.</b> In this work, <b>interference</b> <b>patterns</b> were captured by a He-Ne laser interference system under different incidence conditions, the pattern period measurement was achieved by cross-correlation with, and the pattern contrast was calculated by image processing. Subsequently, the incident angles and intensities of beams were determined based on the analysis of spatial distributions of interfering beams. As a consequence, the relationship between the beam incidence conditions and <b>interference</b> <b>patterns</b> is revealed. The proposed method is useful for the calibration of LIL processes and for reverse engineering applications...|$|R

5|$|Mach-Zehnder interferometers {{are being}} used in {{integrated}} optical circuits, in which light interferes between two branches of a waveguide that are externally modulated to vary their relative phase. A slight tilt {{of one of the}} beam splitters will result in a path difference and a change in the <b>interference</b> <b>pattern.</b> Mach-Zehnder interferometers are the basis {{of a wide variety of}} devices, from RF modulators to sensors to optical switches.|$|E
5|$|Another {{hardware}} quirk produced one of {{the most}} distinctive aspects of the ZX81's screen display – during loading or saving, moving zigzag stripes appear across the screen. The same pin on the ULA is used to handle the video signal and the tape output, producing the stripes as an <b>interference</b> <b>pattern</b> of sorts. The ULA cannot maintain the display during SAVE and LOAD operations, as it has to operate continuously to maintain the correct baud rate for data transfers. The interference produces the zigzag stripes.|$|E
5|$|Interferometry {{is another}} method {{to find the}} {{wavelength}} of electromagnetic radiation for determining the speed of light. A coherent beam of light (e.g. from a laser), with a known frequency (f), is split to follow two paths and then recombined. By adjusting the path length while observing the <b>interference</b> <b>pattern</b> and carefully measuring the change in path length, the wavelength of the light (λ) can be determined. The speed of light is then calculated using the equationc=λf.|$|E
50|$|The {{specifications}} {{portion of}} the tech specs which came with earlier G1 Transformers were obfuscated with <b>interference</b> <b>patterns</b> which made them difficult to read without a decoder which {{was included in the}} box for each Transformer.

New processing heads for high-speed laser <b>interference</b> <b>patterning</b> of polycarbonate are introduced, which provide effective patterning speeds up to 0. 9 m 2 min- 1. The surface topography of the processed polymer is analyzed by confocal microscopy and scanning electron microscopy.

5|$|When a {{wave train}} strikes a wall at an oblique angle, the {{reflected}} wave train departs at the supplementary angle causing a cross-hatched wave <b>interference</b> <b>pattern</b> {{known as the}} clapotis gaufré ("waffled clapotis"). In this situation, the individual crests formed {{at the intersection of}} the incident and reflected wave train crests move parallel to the structure. This wave motion, when combined with the resultant vortices, can erode material from the seabed and transport it along the wall, undermining the structure until it fails.|$|E
5|$|Ultracold atom {{trapping}} in optical lattices is {{an experimental}} tool {{commonly used in}} condensed matter physics, and in atomic, molecular, and optical physics. The method involves using optical lasers to form an <b>interference</b> <b>pattern,</b> which acts as a lattice, in which ions or atoms can be placed at very low temperatures. Cold atoms in optical lattices are used as quantum simulators, that is, they act as controllable systems that can model behavior of more complicated systems, such as frustrated magnets. In particular, {{they are used to}} engineer one-, two- and three-dimensional lattices for a Hubbard model with pre-specified parameters, and to study phase transitions for antiferromagnetic and spin liquid ordering.|$|E
5|$|A {{light ray}} {{emanating from the}} source S is {{reflected}} by a beam splitter G and is collimated into a parallel beam by lens L. After passing the slits O1 and O2, two rays of light travel through the tubes A1 and A2, through which water is streaming {{back and forth as}} shown by the arrows. The rays reflect off a mirror m at the focus of lens L, so that one ray always propagates {{in the same direction as}} the water stream, and the other ray opposite to the direction of the water stream. After passing back and forth through the tubes, both rays unite at S, where they produce interference fringes that can be visualized through the illustrated eyepiece. The <b>interference</b> <b>pattern</b> can be analyzed to determine the speed of light traveling along each leg of the tube.|$|E
40|$|Reconfigurable optical {{interconnection}} schemes are proposed and described {{which are based}} on optoelectronic holograms. Their <b>interference</b> <b>patterns</b> can be changed dynamically. To establish connections as free-space links, the light beams emitted from even hundreds of light sources are imaged onto an array of small dynamic holograms. Their <b>interference</b> <b>patterns</b> are optically and electronically controllable. These holograms diffract and focus each of the incident light beams individually onto the receiving photodiodes. By changing the hologram <b>interference</b> <b>patterns</b> dynamically, an optical switch is obtained. It renders the establishment of reconfigurable {{optical interconnection}}s. Optoelectronic holograms as very-high-resolution spatial light modulators are proposed...|$|R

5|$|The BBC had {{initiated}} tendering to {{have the}} LS3/5 made under license. As the broadcasting unit was about to order another batch of the monitor, {{it was found that}} KEF had discontinued the B110 (A6362) and the T27 (A6340) in favour of the B110 (SP1003) and T27 (SP1032) specification, and was already using them in the Coda, one of their own-brand commercial loudspeakers. Thus the design had to be revised because these new units had different impedances, technical characteristics and altered resonance patterns. The tweeter was considered potentially fragile because it now had an exposed dome, so a suitable protection grille was found to cover and protect the dome. The tweeter was also surrounded by a thick felt rectangle to prevent <b>interference</b> <b>pattern</b> effects being created by the edge of the cabinet. The crossover also had to undergo change, and the LS3/5 became the LS3/5A in the early summer of 1974.|$|E
5|$|Photons, {{like all}} quantum objects, exhibit wave-like and particle-like properties. Their dual wave–particle nature can be {{difficult}} to visualize. The photon displays clearly wave-like phenomena such as diffraction and interference on the length scale of its wavelength. For example, a single photon passing through a double-slit experiment exhibits interference phenomena but only if no measure was made at the slit. A single photon passing through a double-slit experiment lands on the screen with a probability distribution given by its <b>interference</b> <b>pattern</b> determined by Maxwell's equations. However, experiments confirm that the photon is not a short pulse of electromagnetic radiation; it does not spread out as it propagates, nor does it divide when it encounters a beam splitter. Rather, the photon seems to be a point-like particle since it is absorbed or emitted as a whole by arbitrarily small systems, systems much smaller than its wavelength, such as an atomic nucleus (≈10−15 m across) or even the point-like electron. Nevertheless, the photon is not a point-like particle whose trajectory is shaped probabilistically by the electromagnetic field, as conceived by Einstein and others; that hypothesis was also refuted by the photon-correlation experiments cited above. According to our present understanding, the electromagnetic field itself is produced by photons, which in turn result from a local gauge symmetry and the laws of quantum field theory (see the Second quantization and Gauge boson sections below).|$|E
5|$|The {{heart of}} the Fabry–Pérot {{interferometer}} {{is a pair of}} partially silvered glass optical flats spaced several millimeters to centimeters apart with the silvered surfaces facing each other. (Alternatively, a Fabry–Pérot etalon uses a transparent plate with two parallel reflecting surfaces.) As with the Fizeau interferometer, the flats are slightly beveled. In a typical system, illumination is provided by a diffuse source set at the focal plane of a collimating lens. A focusing lens produces what would be an inverted image of the source if the paired flats were not present; i.e. {{in the absence of the}} paired flats, all light emitted from point A passing through the optical system would be focused at point A'. In Fig.6, only one ray emitted from point A on the source is traced. As the ray passes through the paired flats, it is multiply reflected to produce multiple transmitted rays which are collected by the focusing lens and brought to point A' on the screen. The complete <b>interference</b> <b>pattern</b> takes the appearance of a set of concentric rings. The sharpness of the rings depends on the reflectivity of the flats. If the reflectivity is high, resulting in a high Q factor (i.e. high finesse), monochromatic light produces a set of narrow bright rings against a dark background. In Fig.6, the low-finesse image corresponds to a reflectivity of 0.04 (i.e. unsilvered surfaces) versus a reflectivity of 0.95 for the high-finesse image.|$|E
40|$|Quasiparticle <b>interference</b> <b>patterns</b> {{measured}} by {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} (STM) {{can be used to}} study the local electronic structure of metal surfaces and high temperature superconductors. Here, we show that even in non-magnetic systems the spin of the quasiparticles can {{have a profound effect on}} the <b>interference</b> <b>patterns.</b> On Bi(110), where the surface state bands are not spin-degenerate, the patterns are not related to the dispersion of the electronic states in a simple way. In fact, the features which are expected for the spin-independent situation are absent and the observed <b>interference</b> <b>patterns</b> can only be interpreted by taking spin-conserving scattering events into account.

25|$|When {{the light}} {{acts as a}} wave, because of quantum {{interference}} one can observe that there are regions that the photons avoid, called dark fringes.

If one of the pinholes is blocked, the <b>interference</b> <b>pattern</b> {{will no longer be}} formed, and some of the light will be blocked by the wires.

40|$|Afundamental goal {{of visual}} {{neuroscience}} {{is to identify}} theneural pathways representingdifferent image features. It iswidely argued that {{the early stages of}} these pathways represent linear features of the visual scene and that the nonlinearities necessary to represent complex visual patterns are introduced later in cortex. We tested this by comparing the responses of subcortical and cortical neurons to interfer-ence patterns constructed by summing sinusoidal gratings. Although a linearmechanismcandetect the component gratings, a nonlinear mechanism is required todetect an interferencepattern resulting fromtheir sum. Consistentwith in vitro retinal ganglion cell recordings, we found that <b>interference</b> <b>patterns</b> are represented subcortically by cat LGN Y-cells, but not X-cells. Linear and nonlinear tuning properties of LGN Y-cells were then characterized and compared quantitatively with those of cortical area 18 neurons responsive to <b>interference</b> <b>patterns.</b> This comparison revealed a high degree of similarity between the two neural populations, including the following: (1) the representation of similar spatial frequencies in both their linear and nonlinear responses, (2) comparable orientation selectivity for the high spatial frequency carrier of <b>interference</b> <b>patterns,</b> and (3) the same difference in their temporal frequency selectivity for drifting gratings versus the envelope of <b>interference</b> <b>patterns.</b> The present findings demonstrate that the nonlinear subcortical Y-cell pathway represents complex visual patterns and likely underlies cortical responses to <b>interference</b> <b>patterns.</b> We suggest that linear and nonlinear mechanisms important for encoding visual scenes emerge in parallel through distinct pathways originating at the retina...|$|R
