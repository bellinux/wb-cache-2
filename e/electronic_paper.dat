25|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>paper,</b> {{also called}} e-paper, is a display {{technology}} designed {{to mimic the}} appearance of ordinary ink on paper. <b>Electronic</b> <b>paper</b> reflects light like ordinary paper and is capable of holding text and images indefinitely without drawing electricity, while allowing the image to be changed later. Applications of e-paper technology include e-book readers capable of displaying digital versions of books, magazines and newspapers, electronic pricing labels in retail shops, time tables at bus stations, and electronic billboards. <b>Electronic</b> <b>paper</b> was invented in 1973 by Nick Sheridon at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center. The first <b>electronic</b> <b>paper,</b> called Gyricon, consisted of polyethylene spheres between 75 and 106 micrometres across.|$|E

25|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>paper</b> and e-paper are display {{devices that}} mimic the {{appearance}} of ordinary ink on paper. Unlike conventional backlit flat panel displays that emit light, <b>electronic</b> <b>paper</b> displays reflect light like paper. This may make them more comfortable to read, and provide a wider viewing angle than most light-emitting displays. The contrast ratio in electronic displays available as of 2008 approaches newspaper, and newly (2008) developed displays are slightly better. An ideal e-paper display can be read in direct sunlight without the image appearing to fade.|$|E

25|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>paper</b> {{was first}} {{developed}} in the 1970s by Nick Sheridon at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center. The first <b>electronic</b> <b>paper,</b> called Gyricon, consisted of polyethylene spheres between 75 and 106 micrometers across. Each sphere is a janus particle composed of negatively charged black plastic {{on one side and}} positively charged white plastic on the other (each bead is thus a dipole). The spheres are embedded in a transparent silicone sheet, with each sphere suspended in a bubble of oil so that they can rotate freely. The polarity of the voltage applied to each pair of electrodes then determines whether the white or black side is face-up, thus giving the pixel a white or black appearance.|$|E
25|$|One early {{version of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>paper</b> {{consists}} of a sheet of very small transparent capsules, each about 40 micrometers across. Each capsule contains an oily solution containing black dye (the electronic ink), with numerous white titanium dioxide particles suspended within. The particles are slightly negatively charged, and each one is naturally white.|$|E

25|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>paper</b> {{technologies}} {{have a very}} low refresh rate compared to other low-power display technologies, such as LCD. This prevents producers from implementing sophisticated interactive applications (using fast-moving menus, mouse pointers or scrolling) like those common on standard mobile devices. An example of this limit is that a document cannot be smoothly zoomed without either extreme blurring during the transition or a very slow zoom.|$|E

25|$|The Amazon Kindle is {{a series}} of e-readers {{designed}} and marketed by Amazon. Amazon Kindle devices enable users to browse, buy, download, and read e-books, newspapers, magazines and other digital media via wireless networking to the Kindle Store. The hardware platform, developed by Amazon subsidiary Lab126, began as a single device and now comprises a range of devices, including e-readers with E Ink <b>electronic</b> <b>paper</b> displays, Android-based tablets with color LCD screens and Kindle applications on all major computing platforms. All Kindle devices integrate with Kindle Store content, and as of April 2017, the store has over 6.9 million e-books available in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Plasmonic {{nanostructures}} with conductive polymers {{have also}} been suggested as one kind of <b>electronic</b> <b>paper.</b> The material has two parts. The first part is a highly reflective metasurface made by metal-insulator-metal films tens of nanometers in thickness including nanoscale holes. The metasurfaces can reflect different colors depending on {{the thickness of the}} insulator. The three primary colors red, green and blue can be used as pixels for full color displays. The second part is a polymer with optical absorption controllable by an electrochemical potential. After growing the polymer on the plasmonic metasurfaces, the reflection of the metasurfaces can be modulated by the applied voltage. This technology presents broad range colors, high polarization-independent reflection (>50 %), strong contrast (>30 %), fast response time (hundreds of ms), and long-term stability. In addition, it has ultralow power consumption (< 0.5nbsp&mW/cm2) and potential for high resolution (>10000 dpi). Since the ultrathin metasurfaces are flexible and the polymer is soft, the whole system can be bent.Desired future improvements for this technology include bistability, cheaper materials and implementation with TFT arrays.|$|E
