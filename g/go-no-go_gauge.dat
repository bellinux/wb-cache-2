40|$|A tool was {{developed}} to repair or replace AN fittings on the shuttle external tank (ET). (The AN thread {{is a type of}} fitting used to connect flexible hoses and rigid metal tubing that carry fluid. It is a U. S. military-derived specification agreed upon by the Army and Navy, hence AN.) The tool is used on a drill and is guided by a pilot shaft that follows the inside bore. The cutting edge of the tool is a standard-size replaceable insert. In the typical Post Launch Maintenance/Repair process for the AN fittings, the six fittings are removed from the ET's GUCP (ground umbilical carrier plate) for reconditioning. The fittings are inspected for damage to the sealing surface per standard operations maintenance instructions. When damage is found on the sealing surface, the condition is documented. A new AN reconditioning tool is set up to cut and remove the surface damage. It is then inspected to verify the fitting still meets drawing requirements. The tool features a cone-shaped interior at 36. 5, and may be adjusted at a precise angle with go-no-go gauges to insure that the cutting edge could be adjusted as it wore down. One tool, one setting block, and one <b>go-no-go</b> <b>gauge</b> were fabricated. At the time of this reporting, the tool has reconditioned/returned to spec 36 AN fittings with 100 -percent success of no leakage. This tool provides a quick solution to repair a leaky AN fitting. The tool could easily be modified with different-sized pilot shafts to different-sized fittings...|$|E

Included industrial capacity Universal Testing Machine and brinell hardness tester and polishing and microscopic examination rooms.

40|$|When joint X and R charts are in use, {{samples of}} fixed size are {{regularly}} {{taken from the}} process, and their means and ranges are plotted. This article proposes to perform the sampling in two stages. At first stage, one item of the sample is inspected. If its X value {{is close to the}} target the sampling is interrupted, otherwise the sampling goes on to the second stage, when the X and R values are computed taking into account the whole sample. Appropriate devices, such as <b>go-no-go</b> <b>gauges,</b> can be used to decide if the sampling should go on to the second stage...|$|R
40|$|In this article, we {{consider}} a non-central chi-square chart with double sampling (DS &chi; 2 chart) {{to control the}} process mean and variance. As {{in the case of}} Shewhart control charts, samples of fi xed size are taken from the process at regular time intervals; however, the sampling is performed in two stages. Let X be the process quality variable being measured. During the fi rst stage, one item of the sample is inspected; if its X value is closeto the target value of the process mean, then the sampling is interrupted. Otherwise, the sampling goes on to the second stage, where the remaining items are inspected and anon-central chi-square statistic, say T, is computed taking into account all n items of the sample, that is, their X values. A signal is triggered when the sample point given by theT value falls above the upper control limit of the proposed chart. The DS &chi; 2 chart performs better than the joint X and R charts, except when there is a large change in the process mean. Furthermore, if the DS &chi; 2 chart is used for monitoring diameters, volumes, weights, etc., then the employment of appropriate devices, such as <b>go-no-go</b> <b>gauges</b> can reduce the effort to decide if the sampling should go to the second stage or not...|$|R
