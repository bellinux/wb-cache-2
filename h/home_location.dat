25|$|Nevertheless, the <b>home</b> <b>location</b> of the Kamash indios (hispanized to Camacho or Camach) {{is known}} as the first {{permanent}} human settlement of Barranquilla. During the 19th century, an encomienda of captain Domingo de Santa Cruz was established, granted by the Spanish crown for his notable military performance. This encomienda disappeared in 1559, when it was in the hands of señora Ana Ximénez, widow of Santa Cruz, after the death of her husband. She became the victim of a disregardful violent act by the second encomendero of Galapa, don Pedro de Barros I, when he arbitrarily grabbed all the Camacho population that could offer labour and took them to his encomienda.|$|E

50|$|Saugers {{generally}} move upstream {{to spawn}} during March-May {{depending on where}} their <b>home</b> <b>locations</b> are. They move downstream to their <b>home</b> <b>locations</b> from April-July after their spawning period is over. Saugers {{have been known to}} travel between 10 and 600 km from their <b>home</b> to spawning <b>location</b> downstream. Habitat at spawning sites are less complex and diverse than <b>home</b> <b>locations.</b> Females prefer rocky substrate and pools to deposit their eggs. As females increase in length, egg quality and fecundity increase. However, it is thought that egg production begins to decline after age 6 in female sauger. Sexual maturity is reached between 2 and 5 years old. Other measures of sexual maturity are related to size. A sauger is considered to be an adult when it reaches 250-300 mm. Upon birth, larval saugers drift downstream before developing feeding tendencies and horizontal maneuverability. Juvenile saugers tend to develop in diversion canals and backwaters until autumn when they migrate upstream to their wintering habitat. Residing in diversion canals is a large source of mortality for juvenile saugers.|$|R

2500|$|The ancient Greeks {{used one}} of three words {{to refer to the}} <b>home</b> <b>location</b> of the Spartans. The first refers {{primarily}} to the main cluster of settlements in the valley of the Eurotas River: Sparta. The second word was Lacedaemon (...) this was also used sometimes as an adjective and is the name commonly used in the works of Homer and the historians Herodotus and Thucydides. Herodotus [...] seems to denote by it the Mycenaean Greek citadel at Therapne, in contrast to the lower town of Sparta. It could be used synonymously with Sparta, but typically it was not. It denoted the terrain on which Sparta was situated. In Homer it is typically combined with epithets of the countryside: wide, lovely, shining and most often hollow and broken (full of ravines). The hollow suggests the Eurotas Valley. Sparta on the other hand is the country of lovely women, a people epithet.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{study the}} problem of {{predicting}} <b>home</b> <b>locations</b> of Twitter users using contents of their tweet messages. Using three probability models for locations, we compare both the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). In addition, we propose two novel unsu-pervised methods based on the notions of Non-Localness and Geometric-Localness to prune noisy data from tweet messages. In the experiments, our unsupervised approach improves the baselines significantly and shows comparable results with the supervised state-of-the-art method. For 5, 113 Twitter users in the test set, on average, our approach with only 250 selected local words or less is able to predict their <b>home</b> <b>locations</b> (within 100 miles) with the accuracy of 0. 499, or has 509. 3 miles of average error distance at best.

They are asked to predict, by marking an X on the map, where they thought each burglar lived. After making their predictions on half of the maps, officers randomly receive either no training or training in one of two simple decision-making strategies. The accuracy of predictions at baseline and retest is measured as the distance between the predicted and actual <b>home</b> <b>locations,</b> and these accuracy scores are compared to a commonly used geographic profiling system. Results show that training significantly improved predictive accuracy, regardless of the number of crime locations or topographical detail presented.
