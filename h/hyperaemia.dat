25|$|Vascular remodelling in non-embryonic tissues is {{considered}} to be symptomatic of disease progression. Cardiovascular disease {{remains one of the most}} common causes of death globally and is often associated with the blockage or stenosis of blood vessels, which can have dramatic biomechanical effects. In acute and chronic remodelling, the increase in shear stress due to the decreased diameter of a blocked vessel can cause vasodilation, thereby restoring typical shear stress levels. However, dilation also leads to increased blood flow through the vessel, which can result in <b>hyperaemia,</b> affect physiological regulatory actions downstream of the afflicted vessel, and place increased pressure on atherosclerotic plaques which may lead to rupture. Blockage of blood vessels is currently treated by surgically inserting stents to force vessel diameters open and restore normal blood flow. By understanding the implication of increased shear stress on homeostatic regulators, alternative, less-invasive methods may be developed to treat vessel blockage.|$|E
500|$|Pulmonary {{toxicity}} symptoms {{result from}} an inflammation that {{starts in the}} airways leading to the lungs and then spreads into the lungs (tracheobronchial tree). The symptoms appear in the upper chest region (substernal and carinal regions). This begins as a mild tickle on inhalation and progresses to frequent coughing. If breathing increased partial pressures of oxygen continues, patients experience a mild burning on inhalation along with uncontrollable coughing and occasional shortness of breath (dyspnoea). Physical findings related to pulmonary toxicity have included bubbling sounds heard through a stethoscope (bubbling rales), fever, and increased {{blood flow to the}} lining of the nose (<b>hyperaemia</b> of the nasal mucosa). X-rays of the lungs show little change in the short term, but extended exposure leads to increasing diffuse shadowing throughout both lungs. Pulmonary function measurements are reduced, as noted by a reduction in the amount of air that the lungs can hold (vital capacity) and changes in expiratory function and lung elasticity. Tests in animals have indicated a variation in tolerance similar to that found in central nervous system toxicity, as well as significant variations between species. When the exposure to oxygen above [...] is intermittent, it permits the lungs to recover and delays the onset of toxicity.|$|E

50|$|Reactive <b>hyperaemia</b> or venous hyperemia is the {{transient}} {{increase in}} organ blood flow that occurs following {{a brief period}} of ischaemia. Following ischaemia there will be a shortage of oxygen and a build-up of metabolic waste.|$|E

50|$|Reactive <b>hyperaemia</b> often {{occurs as}} a {{consequence}} of Raynaud's phenomenon, where the vasospasm in the vasculature leads to ischaemia and necrosis of tissue and thus a subsequent increase in blood flow to remove the waste products and clear up cell debris.|$|E

50|$|The CLARIFY {{study was}} a {{physiological}} study in which iFR and FFR were compared to an independent third measure, hyperaemic stenosis resistance (HSR) which uses a combination of pressure and flow assessment to detect ischemia. Both measures compared equally well to this flow-based index. In stenoses classified as ischemic, the wave-free period provided a similar reduction in microvascular resistance as adenosine-mediated <b>hyperaemia</b> over the whole cardiac cycle.|$|E
50|$|An {{intravenous}} {{infusion of}} adenosine is given at 140 µg/Kg/min for 3 minutes with continuous {{heart rate and}} blood pressure recording to induce <b>hyperaemia</b> (normally seen as a drop in systolic blood pressure of 10mmHg or a rise in heart rate of 10bpm). Following this, an intravenous bolus of 0.05 mmol/kg of a gadolinium chelate (such as gadodoteric acid) is administered via an antecubital fossa vein on the contralateral arm to the adenosine.|$|E

Where there is {{peripheral}} artery disease the leg will revert to the pink colour more slowly than normal and also pass through the normal pinkness to a red-range colouring (rubor - redness) often known as sunset foot. This {{is due to the}} dilatation of the arterioles in an attempt to rid the metabolic waste that has built up in a reactive <b>hyperaemia.</b> Finally the foot will return to its normal colour. This part of the test is known as a check for rubor of dependency.|$|E
5000|$|Aphelion and {{software}} products based on Aphelion {{have been widely}} used in the field of ophthalmology.

50|$|It {{is widely}} thought that active <b>hyperaemia</b> is {{mediated}} by the increased synthesis and/or release of vasodilatory agents during periods of heightened cellular metabolism. The increase in cellular metabolism causes the increase in vasoactive metabolic byproducts. Some of the putative vasodilatory agents (associated with metabolism) include, {{but are not limited}} to: Carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen ion (H+), potassium (K+), adenosine (ADO), nitric oxide (NO)). These vasodilators released from the tissue act on local arterioles causing vasodilation, this causes a decrease in vascular resistance and allows an increase in blood flow to be directed toward the capillary bed of the active tissue. Consequently allowing blood flow to meet and match the metabolic demand of the tissue and prevents a mismatch between O2-demand O2-supply. Recent research has suggested that the locally produced vasodilators may be acting in a redundant manner, in which the antagonism of one dilator, be it pharmacologically or pathologically, may be compensated for by another in order to preserve blood flow to tissue. While the locus of blood flow control (at least in skeletal muscle tissue) is widely thought to reside {{at the level of the}} arteriole, research has begun to suggest that capillary endothelial cells may be coordinators of skeletal muscle blood flow during functional <b>hyperaemia.</b> It is thought that vasodilators (released from active muscle fibers) can stimulate a local capillary endothelial cells which, in turn, causes the conduction of a vasodilatory signal to upstream arterioles, this then elicits arteriolar vasodilation consequently, creating a pathway of least resistance so blood flow can be precisely direct to capillaries supplying the metabolically active tissue.|$|E

50|$|Functional <b>hyperaemia</b> is an {{increase}} in blood flow to a tissue due to the presence of metabolites and a change in general conditions. When a tissue increases activity there is a well-characterized fall in the partial pressure of oxygen and pH, {{an increase}} in partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and a rise in temperature and the concentration of potassium ions. The mechanisms of vasodilation are predominantly local metabolites and myogenic effects. Increased metabolic activity of the tissue leads to a local increase in the extracellular concentration of such chemicals as adenosine, carbon dioxide, and lactic acid, and a decrease in oxygen and pH. These changes cause significant vasodilation. The reverse occurs when metabolic activity is slowed and these substances wash out of the tissues. The myogenic effect refers to the inherent attempt of vascular smooth muscle surrounding arterioles and arteries to maintain the tension in the wall of these blood vessels by dilating when internal pressure is reduced and to constrict when wall tension increases.|$|E
50|$|If the {{exposure}} to beta radiation is intense, the beta burns may first manifest in 24-48 hours by itching and/or burning sensation that last {{for one or two}} days, sometimes accompanied by <b>hyperaemia.</b> After 1-3 weeks burn symptoms appear; erythema, increased skin pigmentation (dark colored patches and raised areas), followed by epilation and skin lesions. Erythema occurs after 5-15 Gy, dry desquamation after 17 Gy, and bullous epidermitis after 72 Gy. Chronic radiation keratosis may develop after higher doses. Primary erythema lasting more than 72 hours is an indication of injury severe enough to cause chronic radiation dermatitis. Edema of dermal papillae, if present within 48 hours since the exposition, is followed by transepidermal necrosis. After higher doses, the malpighian layer cells die within 24 hours; lower doses may take 10-14 days to show dead cells. Inhalation of beta radioactive isotopes may cause beta burns of lungs and nasopharyngeal region, ingestion may lead to burns of gastrointestinal tract; the latter being a risk especially for grazing animals.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{treatment}} of disease, Celsus' principal method was to observe and watch over the operations of Nature, and to regulate rather than oppose them, conceiving that fever consisted essentially in an effort {{of the body to}} throw off some morbid cause, and that, if not unduly interfered with, the process would terminate in a state of health. On occasions, however, he boldly recommends the use of the scalpel; his rules for blood letting and purgatives are laid down with detail and precision; and many of the rules he prescribes were not very different from those still in use {{at the beginning of the}} 19th century. His work contains detailed descriptions of the symptoms and different varieties of fever, and he is credited with recording the cardinal signs of inflammation known as [...] "Celsus tetrad": calor (warmth), dolor (pain), tumor (swelling) and rubor (redness and <b>hyperaemia).</b> He goes into great detail regarding the preparation of numerous ancient medicinal remedies including the preparation of opioids. In addition, he describes many 1st century Roman surgical procedures which included removal of a cataract, treatment for bladder stones, and the setting of fractures.|$|E

40|$|Coronary {{blood flow}} is tightly coupled to {{myocardial}} oxygen consumption {{to maintain a}} consistently high level of myocardial oxygen extraction {{over a wide range}} of physical acitivity. This tight coupling has been proposed to depend on periarteriolar oxygen tension, signals released from cardiomyocytes (adenosine acting on KATP channels) and the endothelium (prostanoids, nitric oxide, endothelin) as well as neurohumoral influences (catecholamines, endothelin), but the contribution of each of these regulatory pathways, and their interactions, to exercise <b>hyperaemia</b> in the human heart are still incompletely understood. Thus, in the human heart, nitric oxide, prostanoids, adenosine and KATP channels each contribute to resting tone, but evidence for a critical contribution to exercise <b>hyperaemia</b> is lacking. In dogs KATP channel activation together with adenosine and nitric oxide contribute to exercise <b>hyperaemia</b> in a non-linear redundant fashion. In contrast, in swine nitric oxide, adenosine and KATP channels contribute to resting coronary resistance vessel tone control in a linear additive manner, but are not mandatory for exercise <b>hyperaemia</b> in the heart. Rather, exercise <b>hyperaemia</b> in swine appears to involve KCa channel opening that is mediated, at least in part, by exercise-induced β-adrenergic activation, possibly in conjunction with exercise-induced blunting of an endothelin-mediated vasoconstrictor influence. In view of these remarkable species differences in coronary vasomotor control during exercise, future studies are required to determine whether exercise <b>hyperaemia</b> in humans follows a canine or porcine control design...|$|E
40|$|In older humans, {{infusions of}} endothelial {{agonists}} suggest endothelial dysfunction, {{due in part}} to less nitric oxide (NO) - and prostaglandin (PG) -mediated vasodilatation, and a shift toward PG-mediated vasoconstriction. Ageing can also be associated with lower exercise blood flow (exercise <b>hyperaemia),</b> but the vascular mechanisms mediating this remain unknown. Notably, in young adults, inhibition of NO and PGs during exercise decreases exercise <b>hyperaemia</b> by ∼ 20 and ∼ 12 %, respectively. We tested our first hypothesis that in older humans inhibition of NO would decrease <b>hyperaemia,</b> but that inhibition of PGs would increase <b>hyperaemia</b> by blocking vasoconstrictor PGs. Fifteen older subjects (65 ± 3 years) performed dynamic forearm exercise for 20 min (20 contractions min− 1). Forearm blood flow (FBF) was measured beat-to-beat with Doppler ultrasound, while saline or drugs were infused sequentially via brachial artery catheter in the exercising forearm. After achieving steady-state exercise, l-NAME (25 mg) was infused over 5 min to inhibit NO synthase. After a further 2 min of exercise (saline), ketorolac (6 mg) was infused over 5 min to inhibit PGs, followed by a futher 3 min of exercise with saline. Drug order was reversed in seven subjects. l-NAME reduced steady-state exercise <b>hyperaemia</b> by 12 ± 3 % in older subjects (P 0. 4). The effects of l-NAME and ketorolac were independent of drug order. By comparing these results with our previous results in young adults, we tested our second hypothesis that in older humans inhibition of NO or PGs would have less impact on exercise <b>hyperaemia</b> due to less vasodilatation from these signals. Our results suggest that, compared with young adults, in older humans the relative contribution of NO to exercise <b>hyperaemia</b> is reduced ∼ 45 % (22 ± 4 versus 12 ± 3 %), but the role of PG in mediating vasodilatation is lost in ageing human skeletal muscle. Lower exercise <b>hyperaemia</b> in older humans may be mediated in part by less NO- and PG-mediated vasodilatation during exercise...|$|E
40|$|Blood {{flow through}} aortocoronary venous grafts and its {{response}} to {{a brief period of}} arterial occlusion [...] reactive <b>hyperaemia</b> [...] were studied in relation to the development of postoperative myocardial infarction. In 40 patients with intractable angina due to obstructive coronary artery disease, 72 aortocoronary venous grafts were constructed. In 18 % of the grafts there was no response to the flow to temporary occlusion, due to absence of reactive <b>hyperaemia.</b> In the remaining grafts the flow increased from 17 % to 26 %. In 17 - 5 % of the patients postoperative myocardial infarction was diagnosed. No relation could be established between this control flow through aortocoronary grafts and postoperative myocardial infarction. A significant difference was found in the magnitude of the reactive <b>hyperaemia</b> following occlusion of the graft between patients who developed myocardial infarction (13 - 0 %) {{and those who did not}} (26 - 8 %).

40|$|Maximum {{and stable}} <b>hyperaemia</b> are {{critical}} prerequisites for the accurate measurement of fractional flow reserve (FFR). However, {{in some patients}} in whom <b>hyperaemia</b> is induced through a central vein (IV) the minimum distal coronary pressure to aortic pressure ratio (Pd/Pa ratio) develops before the stabilisation of <b>hyperaemia.</b> We sought to describe the prevalence, magnitude and clinical implications of this phenomenon. The FFR tracing archive of a single institution was reviewed {{and a total of}} 104 high-quality IV-FFR recordings from 90 patients were identified. Whenever the minimum Pd/Pa ratio was found before the onset of stable <b>hyperaemia,</b> a search for the lowest Pd/Pa ratio within the steady-state hyperaemic plateau was performed and labelled as FFRstable. Whilst in most cases the minimum Pd/Pa ratio developed during stable <b>hyperaemia,</b> in 19 cases (prevalence of 18. 3 % [95 % CI: 12. 0 % to 26. 8 %]) this value was found before the stabilisation of the hyperaemic state.

The levels of general conjunctival <b>hyperaemia</b> (p < 0. 01), limbal <b>hyperaemia</b> (p < 0. 001), and the extent of limbal vessel penetration (p < 0. 001) were found to be significantly greater in the lens-wearing eye, relative to the control eye, immediately on lens removal. The patients ceased lens wear for up to one month, and changes in the levels of vascular response were monitored during this period. General conjunctival <b>hyperaemia</b> and limbal <b>hyperaemia</b> recovered to levels observed in the non-lens-wearing eye within two and seven days after lens removal, respectively.

40|$|Exercise <b>hyperaemia</b> {{is partly}} {{mediated}} by adenosine A 2 A-receptors. Adenosine can evoke nitric oxide (NO) release via endothelial A 2 A-receptors, but the role for NO in exercise <b>hyperaemia</b> is controversial. We {{have investigated the}} contribution of NO to <b>hyperaemia</b> evoked by isometric twitch contractions {{in its own right}} and in interaction with adenosine. In three groups of anaesthetized rats the effect of A 2 A-receptor inhibition with ZM 241385 on femoral vascular conductance (FVC) and hindlimb O 2 consumption at rest and during isometric twitch contractions (4 Hz) was tested (i) after NO synthase inhibition with l-NAME, and when FVC had been restored by infusion of (ii) an NO donor (SNAP) or (iii) cell-permeant cGMP. Exercise <b>hyperaemia</b> was significantly reduced (32 %) by l-NAME and further significantly attenuated by ZM 241385 (60 % from control). After restoring FVC with SNAP or 8 -bromo-cGMP, l-NAME did not affect exercise <b>hyperaemia,</b> but ZM 241385 still significantly reduced the <b>hyperaemia</b> by 25 %. There was no evidence that NO limited muscle during contraction. These results indicate that NO is not required for adenosine release during contraction and that adenosine released during contraction does not depend on new synthesis of NO to produce vasodilatation. They also substantiate our general hypothesis that the mechanisms by which adenosine contributes to muscle vasodilatation during systemic hypoxia and exercise are different: we propose that, during muscle contraction, adenosine is released from skeletal muscle fibres independently of NO and acts directly on A 2 A-receptors on the vascular smooth muscle to cause vasodilatation...|$|E
40|$|External {{compression}} of limbs to below-diastolic pressure (venous compression) {{has been shown}} to produce a short-lived <b>hyperaemia</b> in supply arteries. Intermittent pneumatic compression is currently under investigation therefore as a treatment for peripheral arterial disease. The optimal timing of the compression will depend on the duration of <b>hyperaemia</b> produced by a particular duration of compression, and the purpose of this work was to test that link. Nineteen healthy volunteers underwent intermittent {{compression of}} one leg with two compression cycles – one compressing for 10 s each time, the other for 1 min. Blood flow velocities in the common femoral artery was shown to increase on release of the compression by 38 % (inter-quartile range 27 – 56 %) for the sequence with short duration compression, and by 57 % (inter-quartile range 37 – 87 %) for the longer sequence (difference, P = 0 · 005, Wilcoxon). The <b>hyperaemia</b> duration above the baseline level was 37 s (inter-quartile range 32 – 49 s) for the short sequence, and 54 s (inter-quartile range 37 – 76 s) for the longer sequence (difference, P = 0 · 001, Wilcoxon). The magnitude of the change in the compression duration was not equalled by the difference in <b>hyperaemia</b> duration, suggesting that the physiological mechanism behind the <b>hyperaemia</b> is unlikely to be due solely to simple accumulation of metabolites, and a myogenic mechanism remains possible. Therapies for peripheral arterial disease need not employ long duration compression, as a greater percentage of time will be spent in <b>hyperaemia</b> with short duration intermittent compression...|$|E
