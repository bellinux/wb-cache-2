40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s Pentecostal-Charismatic Church {{membership}} has grown spectacularly in Africa. Scholars of these churches (which are sometimes also called Pentecostalist or Born-Again Churches) invariably mention how audiovisual media are used both in church gatherings {{and in the}} proselytising activities of their members. ( [...] .) Revisiting the colonial past and {{taking into account the}} interfaces of religion and visual media before the heydays of Pentecostalism will, as I hope, contribute to our understandings of how Pentecostalist leaders have been drawn to capture mass media. I attempt to illustrate this with material about <b>Kinshasa's</b> media history. ( [...] .) Through considering an outline of the origins of <b>Kinshasa's</b> evangelising serials, it will become clear that the Christian design of <b>Kinshasa's</b> post-millennial Pentecostalist telenarratives is not at all a 'new' phenomenon.

40|$|This {{chapter is}} {{concerned}} with the role of visual media in <b>Kinshasa’s</b> Christian communities. The main question deals with the “mediation” of the sacred within the circles of born-again Christians and Kimbanguists. In particular, I ask: how do religious practitioners make sense of the visual possibilities of modern communication and information technologies (ICT) ? Or, how do, in emic perspectives, the visual possibilities of ICT differently allow, facilitate or hamper the flow of divine powers and the expansion of <b>Kinshasa’s</b> Christian communities? With this chapter, I want to initiate comparative investigations in <b>Kinshasa’s</b> Christian landscape by juxtaposing PCC and Kimbanguism, an Independent African Church venerating the prophet Simon Kimbangu. Comparison is done concerning their engagements with the visual as a privileged channel to establish connection with the Otherworldly, the Holy Spirit (in the case of the PCCs) or Simon Kimbangu (for the Kimbanguists). The main argument of the paper is that although both Kimbanguist and Pentecostal Christianity participate in <b>Kinshasa’s</b> media world, their media pedagogies are utterly different. This follows different approaches towards the power of the image; the role of witchcraft in their beliefs system; the definition of how to become a “good Christian”; and a different hierarchy of the optical and the acoustic within the communication with the Divine. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Many sub-Saharan African {{societies}} have undergone significant political {{shifts in the}} last two decades. Changes in political representation and leadership have induced new forms of political mediation and communication. This article probes {{into one of the most}} visible transformations in <b>Kinshasa’s</b> political society: TV news reports about urban misery, often resulting from a malfunctioning state, are now produced in which <b>Kinshasa’s</b> inhabitants testify about their difficulties and press fellow citizens as well as local and national leaders to bring about change. Exposing suffering is a strategy to mobilize shame and it thus becomes a political act. The main argument is that the proximity account constitutes a novel and extremely timely kind of conversation in <b>Kinshasa’s</b> political society because the public appeal and significance of the proximity report are both outcome and catalysts of mass-mediated political experiments, drawing citizens and political leaders into one political community. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|The poor {{state of}} {{discipline}} of the Congolese forces became apparent again in 1990.

40|$|Authorship" in {{the context}} of <b>Kinshasa's</b> {{television}} serials is a complex, multilayered concept. The participation of sacred powers and of the audience as well as the role of improvisation all undermine the idea of one, single author producing a stable script.

40|$|My goal in {{this article}} is to explore the {{interpretation}} of dreams in <b>Kinshasa’s</b> Pentecostal culture, and to relate it to the more profound semiotic Pentecostal evangelising project. I will demonstrate that the attribution of meaning to dreams and dream experiences lies {{at the very heart of}} the Pentecostal proselytising endeavour. The dream opens up a fascinating realm of narratives and feelings since it bridges the spheres of the day and the night, the conscious and the unconscious, the visible and the invisible. In the dream, hidden or forbidden knowledge might manifest itself, just as apparitions and visions can be experienced. We might argue that the transgression of various borders and also the combination of the rhetoric with the visual (when the dream is recounted and interpreted) account for the central status of the dream among <b>Kinshasa’s</b> Pentecostal evangelisers. I will first examine how dreams acquire their meaning before discussing the representation of the dream experience itself in <b>Kinshasa’s</b> Pentecostal popular culture. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|The {{government}} {{in the capital city}} <b>Kinshasa,</b> the United Nations, the European Union, and bilateral partners which include Angola, South Africa, and Belgium are attempting to create a viable force with the ability to provide the Democratic Republic of Congo with stability and security.

5|$|About 1,500 {{members of}} the Front for the National Liberation of the Congo (FNLC) invaded Shaba Province (modern-day Katanga Province) in Zaire from eastern Angola on 7 March 1977. The FNLC wanted to {{overthrow}} Mobutu, and the MPLA government, suffering from Mobutu's support for the FNLA and UNITA, {{did not try to}} stop the invasion. The FNLC failed to capture Kolwezi, Zaire's economic heartland, but took Kasaji and Mutshatsha. The Zairean army (the Forces Armées Zaïroises) was defeated without difficulty and the FNLC continued to advance. On 2 April, Mobutu appealed to William Eteki of Cameroon, Chairman of the Organization of African Unity, for assistance. Eight days later, the French government responded to Mobutu's plea and airlifted 1,500 Moroccan troops into <b>Kinshasa.</b> This force worked in conjunction with the Zairean army, the FNLA and Egyptian pilots flying French-made Zairean Mirage fighter aircraft to beat back the FNLC. The counter-invasion force pushed the last of the militants, along with numerous refugees, into Angola and Zambia in April 1977.|$|E

40|$|The article situates {{the genre}} of {{stand-up}} comedy, increasingly performed in <b>Kinshasa’s</b> mourning spaces (matanga), within <b>Kinshasa’s</b> social universe. This funerary joking, performed by comedians unrelated to the bereaved, signifies a strong departure from the customary funerary humor in which accepted jokers occupy particular social positions towards the deceased. Following recent changes {{in the organization of}} the mourning rituals within the circles of <b>Kinshasa’s</b> wealthy and the rich, these rather intimate events are ever more open to ‘strangers’, who anticipate the spending capacities of the gathered crowd. Comedians constitute one among a wide range of outsiders, who approach the bereaved community as a space of opportunities. It is argued that this new cultural genre is utterly urban, and could only emerge within urban lifeworlds, where conviviality with others, and in particular an understanding of people’s necessity of making a living in precarious circumstances, push the mourning community to transform into an audience paying for a cultural performance. Humor is not only derived from a symbolic difference between the poor and the rich, but also by the performance of exaggerated flattery producing the illusion of patronage and situating the comedian {{for the duration of the}} performance within a feigned patron-client relationship. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Kinois {{started to}} {{produce their own}} {{television}} serials only in 1981. One could thus argue that <b>Kinshasa’s</b> teleserials are a postcolonial phenomenon. Yet, origins of the teleserials {{can be traced back}} to the colonial period, when stage theatre, radio and television were brought to the colony. In my presentation, I will give a historical overview of how the teleserials and the broadcasting system as a whole have been put in the service of different hegemonic forces which gradually became more and more local. Throughout its history, <b>Kinshasa’s</b> mass-mediated drama has promoted different “key scenarios” and concomitant social models, being the convert, the évolué and the citizen, and, nowadays, the born-again Christian. Importantly, these characters were not only staged as social ideals, but the producers also belonged to these categories. status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|Houphouët-Boigny was a {{participant}} in the November 1960 Congo Crisis, a period of political upheaval and conflict in Congo-Kinshasa. The Ivorian leader supported President Joseph Kasa-Vubu, an opponent of Lumumba, and followed France in supporting the controversial Congolese Prime Minister Moise Tshombe. Tshombe, disliked by much of Africa, was passionately defended by Houphouët-Boigny and was even invited into OCAM in May 1965. After the overthrow of Kasa-Vubu by General Mobutu in November 1965, the Ivorian president supported, in 1967, a plan proposed by the French secret service which aimed to bring the deposed Congolese leader back into power. The operation was a failure. In response, Houphouët-Boigny decided to boycott the fourth annual summit of the OAU held in September 1967 in <b>Kinshasa.</b>|$|E
5|$|Turner {{writes that}} the two most {{prominent}} opponents of military integration (brassage) were Colonel Jules Mutebusi, a Munyamulenge from South Kivu, and Laurent Nkunda, a Rwandaphone Tutsi who Turner says was allegedly from Rutshuru in North Kivu. In May–June 2004 Mutebusi led a revolt against his superiors from <b>Kinshasa</b> in South Kivu. Nkunda began his long series of revolts against central authority by helping Mutebusi in May–June 2004. In November 2004 a Rwandan government force entered North Kivu to attack the FDLR, and, it seems, reinforced and resupplied RCD-Goma (ANC) at the same time. Kabila despatched 10,000 government troops to the east in response, launching an attack which was called 'Operation Bima.' In {{the midst of this}} tension, Nkunda's men launched attacks in North Kivu in December 2004.|$|E
5|$|A {{decision}} on which factions were to name {{chiefs of staff}} and military regional commanders was announced on 19 August 2003 as the first move in military reform, superimposed {{on top of the}} various groups of fighters, government and former rebels. Kabila was able to name the armed forces chief of staff, Lieutenant General Liwanga Mata, who previously served as navy chief of staff under Laurent Kabila. Kabila was able to name the air force commander (John Numbi), the RCD-Goma received the Land Force commander's position (Sylvain Buki) and the MLC the navy (Dieudonne Amuli Bahigwa). Three military regional commanders were nominated by the former <b>Kinshasa</b> government, two commanders each by the RCD-Goma and the MLC, and one region commander each by the RCD-K/ML and RCD-N. However these appointments were announced for Kabila's Forces armées congolaises (FAC), not the later FARDC. Another report however says that the military region commanders were only nominated in January 2004, and that the troop deployment on the ground did not change substantially until the year afterward.|$|E

5|$|The Second Congo War, {{which began}} in 1998, was still raging when Kagame assumed the {{presidency}} in 2000. Namibia, Angola, Zimbabwe, and Chad had committed troops to the Congolese government side, while Rwanda, Uganda, and Burundi were supporting rebel groups. The rebel group Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD) had split in 1999 into two factions: the RCD-Goma, supported by Rwanda, and the RCD-Kisangani, which was allied to Uganda. Uganda also supported the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo (MLC), a rebel group from the north. All these rebel groups were at war with Kabila's government in <b>Kinshasa,</b> but were also increasingly hostile to each other. Various peace meetings had been held, culminating in the July 1999 Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement which was signed by Kabila, Kagame {{and all the other}} foreign governments. The rebel groups were not party to the agreement, and fighting continued. The RPA continued to be heavily involved in the Congo War during 2000, fighting battles against the Ugandan army in Kisangani and against Kabila's army in Kasai and Katanga.|$|E
5|$|The poor {{performance}} of Zaire's military during Shaba I gave evidence of chronic weaknesses (which extend to this day). One {{problem was that}} some of the Zairian soldiers in the area had not received pay for extended periods. Senior officers often kept the money intended for the soldiers, typifying a generally disreputable and inept senior leadership in the FAZ. As a result, many soldiers simply deserted rather than fight. Others stayed with their units but were ineffective. During the months following the Shaba invasion, Mobutu sought solutions to the military problems that had contributed to the army's dismal performance. He implemented sweeping reforms of the command structure, including wholesale firings of high-ranking officers. He merged the military general staff with his own presidential staff and appointed himself chief of staff again, in addition to the positions of minister of defence and supreme commander that he already held. He also redeployed his forces throughout the country instead of keeping them close to <b>Kinshasa,</b> as had previously been the case. The Kamanyola Division, at the time considered the army's best formation, and considered the president's own, was assigned permanently to Shaba. In addition to these changes, the army's strength was reduced by 25 percent. Also, Zaire's allies provided a large influx of military equipment, and Belgian, French, and American advisers assisted in rebuilding and retraining the force.|$|E

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the social {{significance}} of confessions among <b>Kinshasa’s</b> born-again Christians. Together with conversion narratives and former witches’ testimonies, confessions represent the main discursive rituals in the religious practices of newborn Christians. The analysis departs from the observation that, among <b>Kinshasa’s</b> born-again Christians, first, confessions are usually preceded or followed by deliverance rituals, and, second, they are hardly ever acted out in the intimate and private encounter with the pastor. Rather, these narratives are usually expressed in public, preferably with the sinners’ victims as audience. The public nature of the confessions and their co-occurrence with spiritual cleansing as performed via the deliverance rituals allow us to embark on an analysis which foregrounds {{the uncertainty of the}} Christian subject {{and the ways in which}} the subject can emerge but also be broken down. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Popular {{culture has}} often been {{described}} as apolitical. In particular the format of TV fiction has acquired the aura of a genre that escapes social reality. During this presentation, I will argue that in certain cultural contexts, TV fiction may be firmly embedded {{in the present tense}} of its producers and spectators. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork among <b>Kinshasa’s</b> TV actors between 2003 and 2006, I will emphasise the intimate connections between fictive tales and the social realities from which the teleserials emerge and to which they speak back. <b>Kinshasa’s</b> teleserials grow out of an ongoing dialogue between artists, pastors and the spectators, and constitute a genuine cultural public sphere. Public interests and private experiences are interwoven, thus leading to concerted narratives that deal both with highly individual lifeworlds and urban, sometimes even national, matters. Play and fiction become more serious and real than one could imagine. status: publishe...|$|R
