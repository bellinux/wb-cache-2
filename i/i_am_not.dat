60|$|I {{can hardly}} say just what my {{feelings}} were at this moment. I know that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> surprised. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> frightened and yet <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> frightened. Something in me shrank {{back in a}} sickening terror; but I, the real <b>I,</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> frightened. <b>I</b> {{knew that this was}} my sister, and that there could be no reason why <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> frightened of her, because she loved me still, as she had always done. Further than this <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> conscious of any coherent thought, either of wonder or attempt at reasoning.|$|R

5|$|Bertrand Russell's pamphlet, Why <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> <b>Not</b> a Christian, {{based on}} a speech {{delivered}} in 1927 and later included in a book of the same title, is considered a classic statement of agnosticism.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> {{a man who}} can {{be driven}} or drummed by threats or abuse into an {{attitude}} of justification. But I consider it due to my honour as a loyal British subject and my personal dignity as a man to retire all my public positions.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> {{quite certain}} that the present {{regulations}} governing the arrangement of matches give entire satisfaction, {{and it would be}} worth considering whether they could not be arranged so that each team would play once at home and once at the place where their opponents hail from.|$|E
50|$|If <b>I</b> <b>is</b> a right {{ideal of}} R, then <b>I</b> <b>is</b> {{simple as a}} right module {{if and only if}} <b>I</b> <b>is</b> a minimal non-zero right ideal: If M is a non-zero proper {{submodule}} of <b>I,</b> then it <b>is</b> also a right ideal, so <b>I</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> minimal. Conversely, if <b>I</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> minimal, then there is a non-zero right ideal J properly contained in <b>I.</b> J <b>is</b> a right submodule of <b>I,</b> so <b>I</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> simple.|$|R
6000|$|I do {{not believe}} that <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> patient here if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> engaged in a righteous and heaven-blessed way of life. When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in the Custom-House and then at Salem <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> half so patient. [...] .|$|R
60|$|Yet <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{afraid of}} him. Indeed, {{to tell the}} truth, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> afraid of any one. For eight years <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> shoved in life from pillar to post, until now threats had no terrors for me.|$|R
5|$|After the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, Wilders wrote:I am {{threatened}} for {{the simple}} reason that I am an Islam critic. But, make no mistake, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> the only one who is in danger. The Tsarnaev brothers drew inspiration from Feiz Mohammed's internet rants and decided to kill innocent onlookers at a marathon. Everyone is in danger.|$|E
5|$|Basically, {{a lot of}} {{you know}} the {{political}} situation in my professional career is not positive. It's been really, really hard. I don't even know if this message is going to get to you because I don't know if they want you to hear this. I'm getting a lot of negative feedback from certain corporate people. But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> willing to give up.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> {{too sure}} if John {{actually}} fully {{understood what he}} was saying. He knew he was onto something when he saw those words and turned them into a song.

60|$|Down {{went the}} bright gold head upon dimpled, clasped {{hands on the}} table. Such a {{beautiful}} April storm! Unrestrainedly she sobbed. I wished I could have comforted her.

5|$|I {{liked them}} both {{because they were}} ironic and provocative {{at the same time}} but also unlike me. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> a materialistic person, and I {{certainly}} wasn't a virgin, and, by the way, how can you be like a virgin? I liked the play on words; I thought they were clever. They're so geeky, they're cool. I never realized they would become my signature songs, especially the second one.|$|E
5|$|Your Honor, {{years ago}} I {{recognized}} my kinship with all living beings, and I {{made up my}} mind that I was not one bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> free.|$|E
5|$|From 1954 to 1959 Dawkins {{attended}} Oundle School in Northamptonshire, an English {{public school}} with a distinct Church of England flavour, where he was in Laundimer house. While at Oundle, Dawkins read Bertrand Russell's Why <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> <b>Not</b> a Christian for the first time. He studied zoology at Balliol College, Oxford, graduating in 1962; while there, he was tutored by Nobel Prize-winning ethologist Nikolaas Tinbergen. He continued as a research student under Tinbergen's supervision, receiving his MA and Doctor of Philosophy degrees by 1966, and remained a research assistant for another year. Tinbergen was {{a pioneer in the}} study of animal behaviour, particularly in the areas of instinct, learning and choice; Dawkins's research in this period concerned models of animal decision-making.|$|E

5|$|When {{you were}} hungry, {{you began to}} cry, because you could not speak. You were seven months without teeth, always sucking. But after you got one, you began to gnaw a crust of bread. It {{was not long before}} another came pop. At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did not cry, because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> a child, but you hurt me very much. So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a crust of bread, and I must look for some other milk.|$|E
