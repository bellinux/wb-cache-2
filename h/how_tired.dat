500|$|In 1975, Grant was an {{appointed}} {{director of}} MGM. In 1980, {{he sat on}} the board of MGM Films and MGM Grand Hotels following the division of the parent company. He played {{an active role in the}} promotion of MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas when opened in 1973, and he continued to promote the city throughout the 1970s. When Allan Warren met Grant for a photo shoot that year he noticed <b>how</b> <b>tired</b> Grant looked, and his [...] "slightly melancholic air". Grant later joined the boards of Hollywood Park, the Academy of Magical Arts (The Magic Castle, Hollywood, California), and Western Airlines (acquired by Delta Air Lines in 1987).|$|E

[...] "The Priest and Used Cars" [...] talks about clockwork theory and how it put the fear of death into Butler when he was younger. [...] "Pheromone Cvlt" [...] was about <b>how</b> <b>tired</b> he was with women telling him how broken he is and how he needs to be fixed, and how he wants to find someone who wants to find someone who was not with him because he was a [...] "fucking mess". Butler commented how the lyrics of [...] "27 Club" [...] focus on [...] "when people assume I'm pumped full of drugs or a Christian. I'm misidentified all the time".|$|E

Bayona committed to working with real water rather than a computer-generated wave because he wanted the story to be authentic. This meant Watts and Holland spent five weeks filming physically and psychologically demanding scenes in a massive water tank. 16-year-old Holland later described it as a [...] "scary environment ...You can imagine <b>how</b> <b>tiring</b> and brutal that was." ...|$|R

500|$|As her {{popularity}} as {{a singer}} grew, the demands of Selena's performance and travel schedule began to interfere with her education. Her father took her out of school {{when she was in}} the eighth grade. Her teacher Marilyn Greer disapproved of Selena's musical career. She threatened to report Quintanilla, Jr. to the Texas Board of Education, believing the conditions to which Selena was exposed were inappropriate for a girl her age. Quintanilla, Jr. told Greer to [...] "mind her business". Other teachers expressed their concerns when they noticed <b>how</b> <b>tired</b> Selena appeared when she arrived at school. At seventeen, Selena earned a high school diploma from the American School of Correspondence in Chicago, and was also accepted at Louisiana State University. She enrolled at Pacific Western University, taking up business administration as her major subject.|$|E

For a laugh, {{look up the}} YouTube video in which some wag mashed {{together}} a medley of 30 different songs that already borrowed [...] "That which does not kill me makes me stronger" [...] as a lyrical hook." [...] Kevin Ritchie from Now Magazine emphasized that the lyrics are [...] "about as clichéd as a mission statement can get, but it also makes for a solid pop song." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the song four stars out of five, writing [...] "The message behind her song may already be a well-worn, almost cliched lesson, but as she continues to prove, there's little shame in coming out with the expected." ...|$|E
500|$|Pei's first {{proposed}} design included a large glass pyramid that would fill the interior with sunlight, meant {{to represent the}} optimism and hope that Kennedy's administration had symbolized for so many in the US. Mrs. Kennedy liked the design, but resistance began in Cambridge, the {{first proposed}} site for the building, {{as soon as the}} project was announced. Many community members worried that the library would become a tourist attraction, causing particular problems with traffic congestion. Others worried that the design would clash with the architectural feel of nearby Harvard Square. By the mid-70s, Pei tried proposing a new design, but the library's opponents resisted every effort. These events pained Pei, who had sent all three of his sons to Harvard, and although he rarely discussed his frustration, it was evident to his wife. [...] "I could tell <b>how</b> <b>tired</b> he was by the way he opened the door {{at the end of the}} day," [...] she said. [...] "His footsteps were dragging. It was very hard for I.M. to see that so many people didn't want the building." ...|$|E

500|$|On April 6, {{the first}} day of the battle, the Confederates struck with the {{intention}} of driving the Union defenders away from the river and into the swamps of Owl Creek to the west. Johnston hoped to defeat Grant's army before the anticipated arrival of General Buell's Army of the Ohio. The Confederate battle lines became confused during the fierce fighting, and Grant's men instead fell back to the northeast, in the direction of Pittsburg Landing. A Union position on a slightly sunken road, nicknamed the [...] "Hornet's Nest," [...] defended by the men of Brig. Gens. Benjamin Prentiss's and William H. L. Wallace's divisions, provided critical time for the remainder of the Union line to stabilize under the protection of numerous artillery batteries. Wallace was mortally wounded when the position collapsed, while several regiments from the two divisions were eventually surrounded and surrendered. General Johnston was shot in the leg and bled to death while personally leading an attack. Beauregard, his second in command, acknowledged <b>how</b> <b>tired</b> the army was from the day's exertions and decided against assaulting the final Union position that night.|$|E
2500|$|His {{father died}} in 1932, leaving debts. His mother, subject to {{neurosis}} and depression, became bedridden and dependent on her son for care. Lowry painted after his mother had fallen asleep, between 10pm and 2am, or, depending <b>how</b> <b>tired</b> he was, he might stay up for another hour adding features. Many paintings produced during this period were damning self-portraits (often {{referred to as the}} [...] "Horrible Heads" [...] series), which demonstrate the influence of expressionism and may have been inspired by an exhibition of Vincent van Gogh's work at Manchester Art Gallery in 1931. He expressed regret that he received little recognition as an artist until the year his mother died and that she was not able to enjoy his success. From the mid-1930s until at least 1939, Lowry took annual holidays at Berwick-upon-Tweed. After the outbreak of war Lowry served as a volunteer fire watcher and became an official war artist in 1943. In 1953, he was appointed Official Artist at the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.|$|E
2500|$|On the July 9 {{episode of}} Raw Is War, Kane was {{scheduled}} to face Mike Awesome and Lance Storm in a handicap match. Chris Jericho came out and offered to be Kane's partner, thus {{turning it into a}} tag team match. Near the end of the match, Jericho applied the Walls of Jericho on Lance Storm. As the move was being applied, however, Rob Van Dam and Tommy Dreamer ran through the audience and into the ring and started to beat on Kane and Jericho. In response, WWF wrestlers consisting of The Dudley Boyz, Tazz, Justin Credible, Rhyno, and Raven (all former ECW wrestlers) ran to the ring. After a brief stand-off, the WWF cavalry turned around and attacked Kane and Jericho. This prompted Paul Heyman to leave the announce table and enter the ring. After high-fiving the wrestlers, he announced that ECW has been brought into the Invasion. Heyman talked about <b>how</b> <b>tired</b> he was sitting beside Jim Ross and discussing WCW vs. WWF, stating that he felt that everyone had forgotten about ECW and announced, [...] "This Invasion just got taken to the extreme!".|$|E

30|$|Anna {{said that}} she found it easy to switch between field and her “very, very {{different}} life” back at home, but immediately pointed to a split so complete that “I even look different” in each place, suggesting quite a radical separation. Almost every participant wondered which part of them was “real”. Emma indicated a similar concern, describing {{the feeling of a}} “work mask” coming back on in the field. It was striking <b>how</b> <b>tiring</b> it felt at times to listen to these narratives, which triggered memories from my own career of just how emotionally and physically draining it is to live with this kind of fragmentation, a reality supported by Horney (1972) in her classic psychoanalytic study of the emotional toll of inner conflicts.|$|R

2500|$|Robert Canning of IGN {{gave the}} episode a 6.5, stating {{that it was}} [...] "Passable" [...] and criticized the fact that while many other episodes take funny jokes at Los Angeles and Fox Broadcasting Company's expense, the ones in this episode fell flat. Canning also said all the guest spots were too [...] "wooden and unfunny", {{although}} he remarked that he liked the opening acts. Sharon Knolle of TV Squad loved the main plot and C-plot, but said the sub-plot was too unoriginal and that the Tiger Woods joke was the only successful one. She also criticized the ending; [...] "Too bad the episode ended on a lame joke at Jay Leno's expense. Not that he doesn't deserve it, but I'll bet the animated Rupert Murdoch {{was the only one}} laughing.". Todd VanDer Werff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a D, the worst grade for that night's [...] "Animation Domination" [...] programs. VanDer Werff said that watching [...] "Judge Me Tender" [...] in the same night as the Lost finale and Breaking Bad episode [...] "Fly", both of which he praised as [...] "deeply ambitious" [...] television, [...] "just drove home for me <b>how</b> <b>tired</b> this show is and how little it tries anymore".|$|E
2500|$|With Monroe and Lester Flatt, Scruggs {{performed}} on the Grand Ole Opry and in September 1946 recorded the classic hit [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky"; a song that was designated by the Library of Congress {{to be added to}} the National Recording Registry, and later added to the Grammy Hall of Fame. The work schedule was heavy in Monroe's band. They were playing a lot of jobs in movie theaters all over the south, riding in a 1941 Chevrolet from town to town, doing up to six shows a day and not finishing up until about eleven at night. Lester Flatt said, [...] "It wasn't anything to ride two or three days in a car. We didn't have buses like we do now, and we never had our shoes off". The self-imposed rule was to always get back in time to play the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville each Saturday night. Scruggs said of Monroe that [...] "Bill would never let the music go down no matter <b>how</b> <b>tired</b> we were. If a man would slack off, he would move over and get that mandolin up close on him and get him back up there". Despite the group's success, Scruggs decided the demands were too great. He was single at the time, and the brief few hours on Saturdays that he made it home, it was just to pack his suitcase at the Tulane Hotel where he lived alone, then repeat the cycle—he had done this for two years. He turned in his resignation, planning to go take care of his mother in North Carolina. [...] Flatt had also made up his mind to leave but he had not told anyone. He later gave his two-week notice but, before the notice was up, the bass player Howard Watts announced that he was leaving too. [...] Despite Monroe's pleading, they left the band. Monroe thought Flatt and Scruggs had a secret understanding, but both men denied it. Monroe did not speak to either one for 20 years thereafter, a feud well known in country music circles.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This lecture {{provides}} a {{short history of}} agricultural tractors and wheel equipment. A list of basic tire terms {{used to describe the}} tire profile is covered, along with performance criteria used to match mechanical front drive axles to the rear axle for proper gearing. In addition, the RCI table is introduced to provide a visual example of <b>how</b> <b>tires</b> can be grouped by rolling circumference and overall diameter. A description of tire size designations is listed for bias, radial, and flotation sizing. The load rating designations for ply, star, and load index is also explained. The five most common tread designs for powered axles are defined, with examples of the different patterns. Two examples of the creation of new tire sizes are given: one for large, high-horsepower, four-wheel drive tractors, and one for high-capacity row crop sprayers. Cyclical loads and their restrictions are also discussed...|$|R
