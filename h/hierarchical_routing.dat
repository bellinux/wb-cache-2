40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a new <b>hierarchical</b> {{multihop}} <b>routing</b> algorithm and {{its performance}} evaluation is presented for fully dynamic wireless networks. The routing algorithm operates on a virtual topology obtained by partitioning the routing information for mobile terminals and mobile base stations into a hierarchical, distributed database. Based on the virtual topology, each mobile base station stores {{a fraction of}} the routing information to balance the complexity of the location-update and the path-finding operations. Mobility of the network entities changes the load distribution and causes processing and memory bottlenecks {{in some parts of the}} network. However, since the network routing elements are also mobile, their movement can be used to distribute the load. Thus, new load balancing schemes are intoduced to distribute the routing overhead uniformly among the mobile base stations. The performance of the <b>hierarchical</b> multihop <b>routing</b> algorithm is investigated through simulations.

40|$|Abstract-To support various {{services}} in the current Internet, QoS routing was proposed. QoS routing finds a path to meet the requested QoS specification for a user, reserves network resource, thereby guaranteeing the QoS for the user. Many works have been done for QoS routing in an autonomous system (AS) to make it feasible in large networks. For a large network, <b>hierarchical</b> QoS <b>routing</b> is a most promising candidate because it is scalable. It divides the network into several levels and routing is performed at each level. The {{most important factor in}} <b>hierarchical</b> QoS <b>routing</b> is topology aggregation, which make lower level nodes send simplified and aggregated network topology information to upper level nodes. Therefore the topology aggregation enables QoS routing to be run in large networks while it causes some error during the aggregation process. In this paper, we introduce a way to optimize the topology aggregation to improve the performance of QoS routing in terms of exactness. Our scheme uses partial optimization technique instead of whole topology optimization, which is general enough to be used with other existing schemes. I...|$|R

40|$|<b>Hierarchical</b> <b>routing</b> {{has often}} been {{mentioned}} as an appealing point-to-point routing technique for wireless sensor networks (sensornets). While there is a volume of analytical and high-level simulation results demonstrating its merits, {{there has been little}} work evaluating it in actual sensornet settings. This article bridges the gap between theory and practice. Having analyzed a number of proposed <b>hierarchical</b> <b>routing</b> protocols, we have developed a framework that captures the common characteristics of the protocols and identifies design points at which the protocols differ. We use a sensornet implementation of the framework in TOSSIM and on a 60 -node testbed to study various trade-offs that <b>hierarchical</b> <b>routing</b> introduces, as well as to compare the performance of <b>hierarchical</b> <b>routing</b> with the performance of other routing techniques, namely shortest-path routing, compact routing, and beacon vector routing. The results show that <b>hierarchical</b> <b>routing</b> is a compelling routing technique also in practice. In particular, despite only logarithmic routing state, it can offer small routing stretch: An average of ~ 1. 25 and a 99 th percentile of 2. It can also be robust, minimizing the maintenance traffic or the latency of reacting to changes in the network. Moreover, the trade-offs offered by <b>hierarchical</b> <b>routing</b> are attractive for many sensornet applications when compared to the other routing techniques. For example, in terms of routing state, <b>hierarchical</b> <b>routing</b> can offer scalability at least an order of magnitude better than compact routing, and at the same time, in terms of routing stretch, its performance is within 10 - 15 % of that of compact routing; in addition, this performance can further be tuned to a particular application. Finally, we also identify a number of practical issues and limitations of which we believe sensornet developers adopting <b>hierarchical</b> <b>routing</b> should be aware. © 2012 ACM...|$|E
