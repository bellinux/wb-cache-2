5000|$|Polyphthalamide based resins are {{injection}} moulded into parts {{that are used}} {{in a wide variety of}} applications. Automotive uses include <b>fuel</b> and coolant <b>lines,</b> pump wear rings, motor bobbin parts, <b>fuel</b> <b>line</b> <b>connectors,</b> water heater manifolds fuel modules, fuel cut-off valves, thermostat housing, air coolers, coolant pumps, and LED headlights. In electronics, the high melting point of PPA allows SMD parts molded from PPA to be assembled using a lead-free soldering process. [...] PPAs are also used for USB Type-C connectors, LED mounts and cable/wire protection. Other applications for PPA based resins include gas pipes and supply lines for the oil industry (due to their ability to withstand high pressures), Medical applications such as tubing for catheters, in personal care, for toothbrush bristles as well as hairbrushes. PPAs are also used in sports equipment, valve bodies for showers, bushings and bearing pads in aircraft engines ...|$|R

50|$|For example, a dial-up {{computer}} modem {{is generally}} provided with two <b>line</b> <b>connectors,</b> often labelled <b>line</b> and phone. The outside line {{is connected to}} the <b>line</b> <b>connector,</b> and handsets may be connected to the phone connector. When the modem is not in use, the line {{is connected to the}} handsets, but when the modem is in use, the phone connector is disconnected from the outside line. This prevents accidental interruption of the data service by raising the handset, which could occur if the two devices were simply connected in parallel.|$|R
50|$|The powerCON is an {{electrical}} connector manufactured by Neutrik for connecting mains power to equipment {{in a small}} space. It looks and works similarly to the Speakon with the <b>line</b> <b>connector</b> inserted in the chassis connector and twisted to make contact and lock. Both <b>line</b> and chassis <b>connectors</b> are fully insulated even when disconnected.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of professional audio equipment uses TS jacks {{as the standard}} unbalanced input or output line-level connector. TRS jacks are sometimes used for balanced connections, the latter often alongside (or sometimes in the middle of) and {{as an alternative to}} an XLR balanced <b>line</b> <b>connector.</b>|$|R
50|$|On July 5, 1989 the Mill Bay was {{crossing}} Saanich Inlet when a problem arose with the <b>fuel</b> <b>line</b> {{and the engine}} lost power. As the ferry drifted the <b>fuel</b> <b>line</b> was repaired and the ferry eventually made it to shore under her own power.|$|R
5000|$|A Speakon {{connector}} {{is designed}} with a locking system {{that may be}} designed for soldered or screw-type connections. <b>Line</b> <b>connectors</b> (female) mate with (male) panel connectors and typically a cable will have identical connectors at both ends. If it is needed to join cables, a coupler can be used (which essentially consists of two panel connectors mounted {{on the ends of}} a plastic tube). Recently the manufacturer has introduced a new series called STX which includes also male <b>line</b> <b>connectors</b> and female panel Speakon connectors are designed to be unambiguous in their use in speaker cables. With 1/4" [...] speaker jacks and XLR connections, it is possible for users to erroneously use low-current shielded microphone or instrument cables in a high-current speaker application. Speakon cables are intended solely for use in high current audio applications.|$|R
50|$|Modules {{designed}} {{according to}} the ETX 3.0 specification integrate two SATA ports via two slim <b>line</b> <b>connectors</b> designed onto the top side of the CPU Module {{in the vicinity of}} X4.

50|$|Alton station {{serves the}} town of Alton, a {{terminus}} of the regular timetabled network and the railhead of the heritage Watercress line. From 1901 until 1933 the terminus was the railhead or junction of three (inter-main <b>line)</b> <b>connector</b> <b>lines.</b> The branch leaves the main line at Pirbright Junction near Brookwood, Surrey and was electrified (750 V DC third rail) during the late interwar years by Southern Railway. The line alternates between Surrey and Hampshire, terminating toward the centre of north-east Hampshire.|$|R

40|$|The Shuttle/Centaur {{high energy}} upper stage vehicle thermal environments were {{more severe than}} {{previous}} Centaur vehicle thermal environments, creating {{need for a new}} hydrazine <b>fuel</b> <b>line</b> thermal control technique. Constant power heaters did not satisfy power dissipation requirements, because the power required to maintain <b>fuel</b> <b>line</b> thermal control during cold conditions exceeded the maximum power allowable during hot conditions. Therefore, a Raychem Thermolimit self-regulating heater was selected for this application, and was attached to the hydrazine <b>fuel</b> <b>line</b> with Kapton and aluminum foil tapes. Fuel line/heater thermal modeling and subsequent thermal vacuum chamber testing simulated heater thermal performance during all worst-case Shuttle/Centaur thermal environmental conditions. <b>Fuel</b> <b>line</b> temperatures were maintained between the 4 C to 71 C limits during all analytical and test cases. Finally, the thermal model predictions were correlated with the test data, thereby ensuring that the model would provide satisfactory predictions for future missions and/or vehicles...|$|R

5000|$|The {{fuel system}} of a hit-and-miss engine {{consists}} of a <b>fuel</b> tank, <b>fuel</b> <b>line,</b> check valve and fuel mixer. The fuel tank most typically holds gasoline but many users would start the engines with gasoline and then switch over to a cheaper fuel such as kerosene or diesel [...] The <b>fuel</b> <b>line</b> connects the <b>fuel</b> tank to the mixer. Along the <b>fuel</b> <b>line,</b> a check valve keeps the fuel from running back to the tank between combustion strokes. The mixer creates the correct fuel-air mixture {{by means of a}} needle valve attached to a weighted or spring-loaded piston usually in conjunction with an oil-damped dashpot.|$|R

This paper reviews options for the definition of <b>fuel</b> poverty <b>lines</b> and techniques for fuel poverty measurement. Based on household data from Germany, figures that would result from different <b>fuel</b> poverty <b>lines</b> are derived. Different <b>fuel</b> poverty <b>lines</b> yield highly different results with respect to which households are identified as fuel poor. Thus, {{the choice of the}} <b>fuel</b> poverty <b>line</b> matters decisively for the resulting assessment. Options for fuel poverty measurement and subgroup comparison are discussed...|$|R
