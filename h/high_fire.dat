5|$|After {{the lookout}} {{at the summit}} was abandoned, the Forest Service changed {{strategies}} from a few lookouts very high up to many lookouts on lower peaks. They placed many lookouts around Adams including one on the southwest slopes of Adams at Madcat Meadows, one on Goat Butte, one on Council Bluff above Council Lake, and many other places farther from the mountain. Eventually these lookouts became obsolete as airplanes became the cheaper method to spot fires. Most all of these lookouts have since been abandoned and most all have been removed or left to disintegrate. One, Burley Mountain, is staffed every summer and another, Red Mountain, was restored in 2010 and decisions regarding its future are pending. Two lookouts remain nearby on the Yakama Indian Reservation. One, Satus Peak, is staffed every season and the other, Signal Peak, is staffed during periods of <b>high</b> <b>fire</b> danger.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to {{minimize}} the chances of out of control fires and threats to people and structures, park employees {{do more than just}} monitor the potential for fire. Controlled burns are prescribed fires which are deliberately started to remove dead timber under conditions which allow fire fighters an opportunity to carefully control where and how much wood is consumed. Natural fires are sometimes considered prescribed fires if they are left to burn. In Yellowstone, unlike some other parks, there have been very few fires deliberately started by employees as prescribed burns. However, over the last 30 years, over 300 natural fires have been allowed to burn naturally. In addition, fire fighters remove dead and down wood and other hazards from areas where they will be a potential fire threat to lives and property, reducing the chances of fire danger in these areas. Fire monitors also regulate fire through educational services to the public and have been known to temporarily ban campfires from campgrounds during periods of <b>high</b> <b>fire</b> danger. The common notion in early United States land management policies was that all forest fires were bad. Fire was seen as a purely destructive force and there was little understanding that it {{was an integral part of}} the ecosystem. Consequently, until the 1970s, when a better understanding of wildfire was developed, all fires were suppressed. This led to an increase in dead and dying forests, which would later provide the fuel load for fires that would be much harder, and in some cases, impossible to control. Fire Management Plans were implemented, detailing that natural fires should be allowed to burn if they posed no immediate threat to lives and property.|$|E
5|$|Mark {{shows an}} {{interest}} in Paige, but discovers she is dating Tyler. He later learns {{that this is a}} ruse to cover up their involvement with Dimato, who has bought the garage. They eventually regain Mark's trust after helping to bring Dimato to justice, and Mark and Paige reunite. Mark and Tyler's brother Aaron (Matt Wilson) comes to stay with them, and they are later joined by their father Russell (Russell Kiefel), who has a strained relationship with his sons. The Brennans consider buying the garage together, but Tyler later reveals that Russell abused him when he was younger. Mark and Aaron support Tyler and force Russell to leave. Mark and Paige discuss their future together when he admits that he is ready to have children, while she is not. Mark asks Tyler to buy Number 24 with him. They brothers fall out when Tyler learns that Mark tried to protect Aaron from arrest during his investigation into the Erinsborough <b>High</b> <b>fire.</b> While discussing their future, Mark and Paige get engaged. Mark is deeply critical of Paige when she befriends Dimato's lover Michelle Kim (Ra Chapman), who claims to be on the run from Dimato. The issue divides Mark, who does not trust Michelle, and Paige, who believes Mark thinks she is naïve. On their wedding day the police find stolen items with Paige's fingerprints on them, and Mark arrests her. She explains that Dimato and Michelle were trying to set her up and that Paul helped her deal with the situation, and that she did not tell Mark to protect him. Furious at Paige for further lies after promising there would be no secrets between them, Mark calls off the wedding. He later apologises and tries to convince Paige to take him back, but she refuses, wanting to find direction in her life and believing they are too different.|$|E

25|$|Reductions {{employing}} {{an excess}} of alkali metals in ammonia or amines are extremely rapid and should be quenched {{after a minute or}} so of reaction time—longer reaction times promote side reactions. When lithium or sodium in ammonia is used, the persistence of a deep blue color in the solution (due to solvated electrons) is a sign that the reaction is complete. Reductions employing alkali metal arene radical anion complexes similarly require a large excess of the reducing agent, very low temperatures and short reaction times. Reductive desulfonylations and reductive eliminations employing alkali or alkaline earth metals in ammonia present a <b>high</b> <b>fire</b> hazard and should be conducted in a properly functioning chemical fume hood away from flammable solvents. Ammonia is a corrosive gas with a pungent odor. Alkali metals react violently with water or even moist air to generate hydrogen, which can then be ignited by the heat of the reaction.|$|E

25|$|Mortality {{rates have}} been well {{observed}} in birds; there have been instances where no young have survived to adulthood in areas with <b>high</b> <b>fire</b> ant density. Many birds including cliff nesting swallows, ducks, egrets, quail, and terns {{have been affected by}} red imported fire ants. Ground nesting birds, particularly the least tern (Sterna antillarum), are vulnerable to fire ant attacks. The impact of red imported fire ants on colonial breeding birds is especially severe; waterbirds can experience a mortality rate of 100%, although this factor was lower for early-nesting birds. Brood survival decreases in American cliff swallows (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) if they are exposed to foraging workers. Songbird nest survival decreases in areas with red imported fire ants present, but survival rates in white-eyed vireo (Vireo griseus) and black-capped vireo (Vireo atricapilla) nests increase from 10% to 31% and 7% to 13% whenever fire ants are not present or when they are unable to attack them. Red imported fire ants may indirectly contribute to low brood survival in the Attwater's prairie chicken. It was first thought that the ants were linked to the decline of overwintering birds such as the loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus), but a later study showed that ant eradication efforts using the pesticide Mirex, which was known to have toxic side effects, was largely to blame.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] University of Cyprus, Faculty of Pure and Applied Sciences, Department of Computer Science, 2011. This thesis {{introduced}} {{a different approach}} in modeling and producing <b>firing</b> irregularity at <b>high</b> rates in order to investigate in an alternative way the claim of Christodoulou and Cleanthous [1] and Cleanthous and Christodoulou [2] that “high firing irregularity enhances learning”. More specifically, this thesis introduces a neural network consisting of two compartment leaky integrate-and-fire model as a neuron to investigate firstly whether this model at the neuron level can produce <b>high</b> <b>firing</b> irregularity at <b>high</b> rates and secondly at the network level whether it can enhance learning. To achieve the above, the two compartment model suggested by Lansky and Rodriguez [3] and Bressloff [4] is implemented and tested for producing <b>high</b> <b>firing</b> irregularity at <b>high</b> rates. In addition the leaky integrate-and-fire model with partial somatic reset is implemented {{as part of this}} thesis for the purposes of comparison with the two compartment leaky integrate-and-fire model in producing <b>high</b> <b>firing</b> irregularity. The results showed that the two-compartment leaky integrate and fire model can produce <b>firing</b> irregularity in <b>high</b> rates. The current model (i. e., two compartment leaky integrate-and-fire) is applied to a neural network trained with reward-modulated spike-timing-depended plasticity with eligibility trace introduced by Florian [5]. For the purposes of comparison, two other networks were implemented by this thesis. One consisted of leaky integrate-and-fire model with total reset (same with the one used by Florian, [5]) and one which consisted of leaky integrate-and-fire model with somatic partial reset (same with the one used by Christodoulou and Cleanthous [1] and Cleanthous and Christodoulou [2]). All three networks are forced to <b>fire</b> at <b>high</b> rates in order to test whether the <b>high</b> <b>firing</b> irregularity at <b>high</b> rates that can be produced by the two of the three networks (i. e., the one with the leaky integrate-and-fire nodes with somatic partial reset and the one with the two compartment leaky integrate-and-fire models) can achieve enhancement in learning as Christodoulou and Cleanthous [1] and Cleanthous and Christodoulou [2] claim. The results showed that the two networks that can <b>fire</b> irregularly at <b>high</b> rates performed better in terms of learning than the one that fires regularly. This is possible as <b>high</b> <b>firing</b> irregularity leads to more accurate correlation between pre-synaptic and post-synaptic spike timing and reinforcement signals. Furthermore it was observed that the network that consisted of two compartment LIF nodes had better result than the network that consisted of LIF model with somatic partial reset as nodes. This cannot be easily explained because the different type of modeling sets limits in terms of comparison. Therefore, further investigation is needed in order to explore the reasons for the better performance by networks which consisted of two compartment LIF neurons. Besides verifying the claim by Christodoulou‟s and Cleanthous [1] and Cleanthous and Christodoulou [2] that <b>high</b> <b>firing</b> irregularity enhances learning, this thesis also introduces o different way of neuron modeling that can achieve <b>high</b> <b>firing</b> irregularity at <b>high</b> rates...|$|R
