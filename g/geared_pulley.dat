50|$|Many IVTs {{result from}} the {{combination}} of a CVT with a planetary gear system which enforces an IVT output shaft rotation speed which is equal to the difference between two other speeds within the IVT. This IVT configuration uses its CVT as a continuously variable regulator (CVR) of the rotation speed of any one of the three rotators of the planetary gear system (PGS). If two of the PGS rotator speeds are the input and output of the CVR, there is a setting of the CVR that results in the IVT output speed of zero. The maximum output/input ratio can be chosen from infinite practical possibilities through selection of additional input or output <b>gear,</b> <b>pulley</b> or sprocket sizes without affecting the zero output or the continuity of the whole system.

40|$|Interference fits {{are widely}} {{employed}} to semi-permanently connect <b>gears,</b> <b>pulleys,</b> flanges, wheels, disks, rotors, and similar mechanical components, to a shaft. The stress state along the hub central portion may be thoroughly predicted by modelling the press-fit problem as plane and by employing the Lamé equations for thick-walled cylinders, and the transmissible torque may be confidently estimated {{by relying on}} the Lamé predictions, since they are valid along most of the contact axial length. 	Often a key {{is added to the}} press-fit, to secure the torque transmission and to prevent any relative rotation between the shaft and the hub. Both parallel and tapered keys are employed in practical applications. With respect to their tapered counterparts, parallel keys possess the advantage that they do not cause any eccentricity. This study considers parallel keys only. The presence of the keyseat increases the compliance of the hub and the shaft, thus producing a diminution of the contact pressure between the hub and the shaft, which results in a similar diminution of the transmissible torque. In this paper, a preliminary Finite Element analysis is carried out to quantify the above diminution of the contact pressure in the assumption of frictionless contact. The analysis is carried out for a solid shaft and for a practically relevant selection of ratios between the hub inner and outer radii. 	A preliminary development is presented of an analytical approach based upon the classical Michell polar solution, which is particularly suitable to mimic rings. 	The diminution of the transmissible torque with respect to a keyless shaft-hub press-fit is quantified, and the results are presented in a design diagram...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{agricultural}} operations now {{demand the}} utilisation {{of a wide}} variety of equipment and specialist machinery systems, with many having rotary elements such as axles, <b>gears,</b> <b>pulleys</b> etc. With these agricultural machinery systems which have rotary elements, uncontrolled vibrations may become an important problem to consider. When the initial ‘switch-on’ frequency meets with the natural frequency of a machine element in the system, undesired noise, high levels of vibration and mechanical failures may occur during operation. In this regard, it is important to predict natural frequency modes of the elements under loading as a result of these vibrations. Computing capability and design software tools are able to assist design and analysis engineers to predict and evaluate natural and forced frequency modes of these elements. These computer aided applications in the engineering domain are typically referred to as Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) and have been used with success in industry for a long time. Hence, it can be shown that the use of CAE applications in the design and analysis processes of agricultural machinery systems could be beneficial. In this study, a finite element modal analysis on the larger pulley of a fodder crushing machine which was manufactured by a commercial company in Turkey, is presented. The torque and cycle of the pulley shaft measurements of the machine were conducted and the data used in the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to simulate resonance frequency modes. As a conclusion of the study, resonance frequency simulations were conducted and the results have been presented.
