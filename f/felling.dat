5|$|The {{history of}} <b>Felling</b> {{stretches}} almost eight hundred years. The original manor at <b>Felling</b> was granted in the 13th century and passed through several families {{until it was}} passed to the Brandling family in 1509. While Lords of the Manor, several members of this family served as Members of Parliament among other civic duties. They were also instrumental in bringing heavy industry to the area, and <b>Felling</b> Colliery (John Pit), {{one of the oldest}} and largest collieries in the region, was developed on their estate. The colliery was the site of two mining disasters which cost over one hundred lives, helping prompt Sir Humphrey Davy and George Stephenson to develop their safety lamps (there is a monument to the workers lost in St Mary's churchyard, Heworth). Other heavy industry took root in the 18th and 19th centuries so that <b>Felling</b> developed from a rural scattering of villages into firstly three distinct settlements at Low and High <b>Felling</b> and <b>Felling</b> Shore, then in 1894 these amalgamated with other local villages into the town of <b>Felling,</b> administered by the <b>Felling</b> Urban District Council at Sunderland Road. The areas that <b>Felling</b> council were responsible for were <b>Felling,</b> High <b>Felling,</b> Windy nook, Leam lane estate, Pelaw,Wardley,Heworth, Bill quay and Follingsby. The council was disbanded in 1974 when <b>Felling</b> was wholly incorporated into the new Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead.|$|E
5|$|The urban {{expansion}} of Gateshead makes exact overall boundaries difficult to define. Although administratively considered one area, official documentation has split <b>Felling</b> into three distinct neighbourhoods: North, Central and High <b>Felling.</b> <b>Felling</b> North is roughly {{comparable to the}} old settlement at <b>Felling</b> Shore, bounded to the north by the River Tyne and the south by Sunderland Road. The other neighbourhoods also broadly follow their historical boundaries; the central area includes <b>Felling</b> town centre and the surrounding streets, while High <b>Felling</b> incorporates Coldwell Lane and the adjoining streets moving south towards Windy Nook.|$|E
5|$|<b>Felling</b> {{today is}} broadly {{residential}} save some light industry {{located at the}} bank of the River Tyne in north <b>Felling.</b> It is governed locally and nationally by the Labour Party. The vast majority of residents identify as white British and, in the north areas particularly, there are high levels of unemployment and deprivation. It is well served by public transport; there are several bus services through the area and <b>Felling</b> lies on the Tyne and Wear Metro line and there are stations at Gateshead Stadium and <b>Felling.</b> <b>Felling</b> town centre remains the principal economic area and has recently benefitted from a £13.5 million regeneration project, with the demolition of the old Co-op supermarket and council building and rebuilding of the town shopping centre shopping units, which now run parallel to a new Asda superstore.The long and rich history of the area is reflected by over a dozen listed buildings, several churches and numerous public houses which are locally listed. It is served by several schools, though levels of educational qualification among residents are comparably low. Leisure provision is good, with four distinctive parks and various riverside facilities. Gateshead International Stadium lies in the area and several professional footballers hail from <b>Felling,</b> including former England international Chris Waddle, as does award-winning author David Almond.|$|E
50|$|Within the {{training}} area are Little <b>Fell</b> (745m) and Mickle <b>Fell</b> (790m), Burton <b>Fell,</b> Warcop <b>Fell,</b> Cronkley <b>Fell</b> {{and part of}} Murton <b>Fell.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Great Cockup is a <b>fell</b> in the {{northern}} region of the English Lake District, {{one of the four}} Uldale <b>Fells</b> (the others being Longlands <b>Fell,</b> Great Sca <b>Fell</b> and Meal <b>Fell).</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{decline of}} heavy industry, meanwhile, {{continued}} apace. In 1932 the large chemical works at <b>Felling</b> Shore closed and was left derelict, {{leaving behind a}} 2 million tonne heap of spoil. <b>Felling</b> Colliery, {{the oldest and most}} extensive of all Felling's industry, had changed hands numerous times after the Brandlings finally sold their stake in the 1850s and ultimately closed in 1931 with the loss of 581 jobs. Fairs boat yard at <b>Felling</b> Shore had been sold in 1919 and became Mitchison's ship yard, but this too closed in 1964.|$|E
5|$|The nearest Metro {{station is}} <b>Felling.</b> The nearest British Rail station is Heworth Interchange.|$|E
5|$|According to the United Kingdom Census 2001, <b>Felling</b> has a {{population}} of 7,299—51.5% of the population are female, slightly above the national average, while 48.5% are male. Only 2.3% of the population were from a black or other minority ethnic group (BME), as opposed to 9.1% of the national population. The average life expectancy is 71 years for men in <b>Felling</b> and 75 years for women. These compare unfavourably to borough averages of 76 and 81 years respectively.|$|E

25|$|Ling <b>Fell</b> and Sale <b>Fell,</b> despite {{standing}} side by side, have no topographical connection. Ling <b>Fell's</b> 'parent' is Broom <b>Fell,</b> while Sale <b>Fell</b> is an outlier of Lord's Seat. They {{are separated}} by the stream of Wythop Beck which drains a catchment to the east. The two <b>fells</b> act as portals to this shy valley as it descends into the Vale of Embleton.|$|R
5|$|By {{the time}} of its <b>felling</b> in 2010, the Webster Sycamore was {{estimated}} to be over 500 years in age.|$|E
5|$|<b>Felling</b> is now largely {{bordered by}} {{settlements}} which {{are part of}} the metropolitan borough. These are Windy Nook to the south, Deckham and the town of Gateshead to the west and Heworth and the Leam Lane Estate to the east. To the extreme north, <b>Felling</b> is bounded by the River Tyne, the largest river in the North East of England. This affords very good views into Newcastle upon Tyne.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, <b>Felling</b> was twinned with Saint-Étienne-du-Rouvray, France. When it {{was absorbed}} into Gateshead in 1974, the {{twinning}} arrangement {{was transferred to}} Gateshead.|$|E
5000|$|The term Furness <b>Fells</b> is also {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} synonym with Coniston <b>Fells,</b> perhaps {{partly as a result}} of the placing of the words [...] "Furness Fells" [...] on some Ordnance Survey 1:250 000 maps. The Coniston <b>Fells</b> properly form only part of the Furness <b>Fells,</b> albeit with all the highest mountains; other <b>fells</b> in Furness are of lower altitude. The Coniston <b>Fells</b> form part of the Southern <b>Fells</b> of the Lake District as defined by Alfred Wainwright.|$|R
50|$|The <b>fells</b> to {{the north}} of Whinlatter are {{generally}} lower and less rugged. They include Whinlatter, Graystones, Broom <b>Fell,</b> Lord's Seat, Barf (with its famous 'Bishop'), Sale <b>Fell</b> and Ling <b>Fell.</b>|$|R
50|$|Meal <b>Fell</b> {{is a small}} <b>fell</b> in the {{northern}} region of the English Lake District, it is situated seven kilometres (4½ miles) south-west of the village of Caldbeck {{and is one of}} the four main Uldale <b>Fells</b> (the others being Longlands <b>Fell,</b> Great Cockup and Great Sca <b>Fell).</b>|$|R
5|$|Land use is mixed. The land to {{the extreme}} north {{adjacent}} to the river is mostly industrial, split by the <b>Felling</b> By-Pass. The land south of the By-Pass towards the town centre is predominantly residential and includes the Nest, Brandling, Stoneygate and the Old Fold estates. Centrally the land is mixed between residential properties and the largely commercial use at Crowhall Lane and Victoria Square. At High <b>Felling,</b> land use is predominantly residential but there is around 25% green-space, including a park, cricket ground and urban open space to the south at Albion Street.|$|E
5|$|Other leisure {{facilities}} include the Keelman's Way, a 14-mile designated cycle and walking route which stretches from Wylam station to Bill Quay and which passes along the riverbank at <b>Felling</b> Shore. Named from the keelboats used to transport coal {{from the various}} collieries in the area, the route was extended into Newburn in 2012 when a Gateshead blue plaque was laid in memory of its creator, Councillor Roy Deane. Also at <b>Felling</b> Shore, at Green Lane, is Friar's Goose marina and the adjacent Friar's Goose Water Sports Club, a privately owned and increasingly popular club predominantly attended by middle-aged patrons who undertake various activities such as sailing, yachting and angling on the River Tyne. <b>Felling</b> Cricket Club has been based at High Heworth Lane at <b>Felling</b> since 1961 and compete locally, {{and there are a}} wide selection of public houses, including the Wheatsheaf at Carlisle Street, the Blue Bell in Victoria Square, the Portland Arms at Split Crown Road and the Pear Tree Inn at Sunderland Road which are all locally listed as places of special local interest.|$|E
5|$|<b>Felling,</b> like nearby Deckham, is {{a rapidly}} growing area {{with more and more}} people from other {{countries}} settling in the area. In 2011, 7.7% of Felling's population were non White British compared with only 3.4% in 2001.|$|E
25|$|He {{maintained}} an Anglican position; an Anglican congregation met at his lodgings in the 1650s, including John <b>Fell,</b> John Dolben, and Richard Allestree. <b>Fell's</b> father Samuel <b>Fell</b> had been expelled as Dean of Christ Church, in 1647; Willis married Samuel <b>Fell's</b> daughter Mary, and brother-in-law John <b>Fell</b> {{would later be}} his biographer. He employed Robert Hooke as an assistant, in the period 1656-8; this probably was another <b>Fell</b> family connection, since Samuel <b>Fell</b> knew Hooke's father in Freshwater, Isle of Wight.|$|R

60|$|When Canaan worship <b>fell,</b> the {{sanction}} of Canaan <b>fell.</b> When temple worship, and altar worship, and the sacrifices of the Levitical priesthood <b>fell,</b> down also came the things themselves. Likewise so, when the service, or shadow and ceremonies {{of the seventh}} day sabbath <b>fell,</b> the seventh day sabbath <b>fell</b> likewise.|$|R
5|$|In 2011, only 3.8% of Windy Nook's {{population}} were non white British, {{compared with}} 2.9% for the ward of Windy Nook and Whitehills and 8.0% {{for the town}} of Gateshead. The amount of Ethnic Minorities resident in Windy Nook is low compared with other Gateshead districts like <b>Felling,</b> Deckham and Saltwell.|$|E
5|$|Sheffield has a reputed 2 million {{trees and}} was once {{described}} as the greenest city in Europe, however since Sheffield City Council signed a controversial 25 year PFI contract with Amey plc in 2012 an aggressive programme of highway tree <b>felling</b> has been implemented across the city, resulting in widespread local protests.|$|E
5|$|South Street Primary is {{the only}} school in Deckham. Some {{children}} of primary–school age, particularly those living in the east of Deckham, attend nearby Carr Hill Primary School instead {{and the majority of}} children aged 11–16 will attend Thomas Hepburn Community Academy in <b>Felling.</b>|$|E
25|$|Holme <b>Fell</b> or Holm <b>Fell</b> is a <b>fell</b> in the Lake District in Cumbria, England. It {{is located}} between Coniston Water and Little Langdale, almost {{isolated}} from the neighbouring Coniston <b>Fells</b> by Yewdale Beck.|$|R
50|$|Illinois State University has an aboreteum {{covering}} {{its main}} quadrangle {{known as the}} <b>Fell</b> Arboretum (in Jesse W. <b>Fell's</b> honour). The University also has a <b>Fell</b> Hall housing the Department of Communication named for <b>Fell.</b>|$|R
50|$|Potter <b>Fell</b> is a <b>fell</b> {{near the}} villages of Burneside and Staveley, Cumbria, England. A number of tarns are present on the <b>fell,</b> {{including}} Gurnal Dubs Tarn and Potter Tarn. Potter <b>Fell</b> has four major summits, two of which (Brunt Knott and Ulgraves) are mentioned in Alfred Wainwright's The Outlying <b>Fells</b> of Lakeland.|$|R
5|$|The 200th {{anniversary of}} the first {{disaster}} was commemorated in <b>Felling</b> on 25 May 2012 by a parade from St Mary's Church at Heworth {{to the place of}} the entrance to the colliery at Mulberry Street.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Felling</b> Health Care Centre is {{the main}} source of General Healthcare for the town's population, and houses St Alban's medical group and Crowhall Medical Group. The GP surgery also has a small Boots {{pharmacy}} in addition to the larger Boots store in the town centre.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} listed {{buildings}} {{are located in}} and around the town centre. Arguably the most significant is Crow Hall, a Grade II* listed building, is an early 18th-century sandstone and ashlar, one-room deep building at Crowhall Lane. The adjacent Crow Hall Cottage and gate piers are Grade II listed buildings. At Victoria Terrace stands <b>Felling</b> post office; a two-story course sandstone building with quoins and a Welsh slate roof. Close by is the Imperial Bingo Club, built as a dance hall in 1927 and converted to a bingo hall in 1930, at Victoria Square. Both are Grade II listed buildings. Also a Grade II listed building is Ardallan; the first house built at Holly-Hill field in <b>Felling</b> constructed of sandstone and with three sash windows. The gates, gate piers and walls are also Grade II listed. Almost immediately next door stands a house and shop at 35 Davison Street; another Grade II listed building.|$|E
50|$|At {{the head}} of Ennerdale stands Great Gable, the highest of the Western <b>Fells</b> at 2,949 ft. More {{commonly}} {{thought of as a}} Wasdale <b>Fell,</b> its profile from that valley gives it its name. The southern arc of the group travels due west from Great Gable, the main ridge consisting of Kirk <b>Fell,</b> Pillar (named for its great out-thrust of rock), Scoat <b>Fell,</b> Haycock and Caw <b>Fell.</b> A number of outliers line the side valleys of Wasdale, namely Yewbarrow, Red Pike (Wasdale), Seatallan, Middle <b>Fell</b> and Buckbarrow. Beyond Caw <b>Fell</b> is the lower Lank Rigg group, consisting of Lank Rigg, Crag <b>Fell</b> and Grike.|$|R
2500|$|The Ordnance Survey Explorer 1:25,000 {{map shows}} it as Holme <b>Fell,</b> but their Landranger 1:50,000 map has it as Holm <b>Fell,</b> albeit with Holme Ground to the north-west. The Ordnance Survey's Gazetteer records only Holme <b>Fell</b> [...] as the {{gazetteer}} {{is based on}} locations on the Landranger maps, {{this suggests that the}} spelling Holm <b>Fell</b> on that map may be an error. The spelling Holme <b>Fell</b> is used by Alfred Wainwright in his book The Southern <b>Fells</b> but Holm <b>Fell</b> by Alan Dawson in his book The Relative Hills of Britain.|$|R
25|$|Souther <b>Fell</b> is {{the eastern}} {{extremity}} of Blencathra, {{a continuation of}} the arm which runs down from the summit over Doddick <b>Fell</b> and Scales <b>Fell.</b> A smooth slope falls eastward from Scales <b>Fell</b> to the col of Mousthwaite Comb at 1,425ft. The ridge then turns northeast for two miles along the summit of Souther <b>Fell.</b>|$|R
