50|$|Among other factors, the {{prosecution}} attempted {{to link the}} murders to Hendricks's belief that divorce was a sin. The prosecution argued that since Hendricks {{did not believe in}} divorce, <b>his</b> only <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> marriage was to kill his wife and children.|$|R

5|$|Icke made {{no effort}} at school, {{but when he was}} nine, he was chosen for the junior school's third-year {{football}} team. It {{was the first time he}} had succeeded at anything, and he came to see football as <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> poverty. He played in goal, which he wrote suited the loner in him and gave him a sense of living on the edge between hero and villain.|$|E
5|$|After the season, the Giants were {{involved}} in a fight for his services of Taylor with the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League. Generals owner Donald Trump had given Taylor a $1 million interest-free, 25-year loan on December 14, 1983, with the provision that he would begin playing in the USFL in 1988. Taylor immediately regretted the decision. The Giants, who were eager to keep Taylor, took part in negotiating <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it. To free Taylor from the contract, the Giants had to pay Trump $750,000 over the next five seasons for Trump to release Taylor's rights, and give Taylor a new six-year, $6.2-million-dollar contract.|$|E
5|$|Caragiale used Mitică as a stock {{character}} to feature in satirical contexts; the biographical insights he provided are short and often contradict each other. Among Mitică's traits are his tendency to generate sarcastic comebacks and sententious catchphrases, a Francized speech, {{as well as}} inclinations to waste time and easily find <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> problematic situations. His existence is connected to events {{in the history of}} Bucharest which he occasionally references in his jokes. Like Lache and Mache, who are present in Caragiale's fiction, the character is usually portrayed as a civil servant who has a hard time making ends meet, but who is well liked by his peers.|$|E
60|$|At Lassiter's low whistle {{the black}} horse whinnied, and {{carefully}} picked <b>his</b> blind <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the grove.

"Had Michael {{been born}} in a poor ghetto in Brazil or Argentina with the ball being <b>his</b> only <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> poverty he would today be {{recognised}} as the biggest genius of the game ever.

5|$|In 2001, {{director}} Ridley Scott cast Bana as an American {{soldier in}} the film Black Hawk Down (2001). Scott, with a recommendation from Russell Crowe and impressed by Bana's performance in Chopper, did not require him to audition. In the film, he played Sergeant First Class Norm 'Hoot' Hooten, an elite Delta Force soldier, who fights <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a battle in Mogadishu, Somalia after a mission to capture two top lieutenants of a renegade warlord goes awry. Bana shed the weight he had gained for Chopper and began an exercise regimen months before filming began. He also trained with Delta Force operators at Fort Bragg, learning to fire weapons and clear rooms.|$|E

When he radios Morgan the next day, his signal is picked up by a survivors' camp where Shane, Rick's wife Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies), and his son Carl (Chandler Riggs) are safe. Unaware that it is Rick on the other line, they lose radio signal before they can warn him of the dangers in Atlanta.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer is in prison, {{trying to}} befriend Munson (Ian Gomez), {{a man who}} has hidden ten million dollars. He warns Munson that the warden (Bill Duke) is trying to con him out of his money. Eventually, Munson, worried that his wife will find where he has hidden the money, enlists Sawyer's help in moving the stash. Sawyer then reveals this {{information}} to the warden in exchange for a reduced sentence and a part of the money, which he puts in a bank account for Clementine Phillips, a baby that previous con victim Cassidy Phillips (Kim Dickens) has told him is his daughter. The warden sarcastically congratulates Sawyer on lying and cheating <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> prison.|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} after his last meeting with the CIA, he led an assault against Matamoros along {{with a handful of}} supporters. The attack failed, and Castillo Armas was wounded and arrested. A year later, he bribed <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> prison, and escaped back to Honduras. The {{engineer}} dispatched by the CIA to liaise with Castillo Armas informed them that Castillo Armas had the financial backing of Somoza and Trujillo. US President Harry S. Truman thereupon authorized Operation PBFORTUNE. Castillo Armas's stories of his revolt and escape from prison proved popular among the right-wing exiles in Honduras. Among these people, Castillo Armas claimed to still have support among the army, and began planning another revolt. His reputation was inflated by stories that he had escaped from prison through a tunnel.|$|E
5|$|Barbarian King Alrik– The former {{ruler of}} {{a horde of}} barbarians. As the {{champion}} of Hades, he sought the Ambrosia to save his ailing father. Alrik was ultimately unsuccessful and was killed by Kratos. Resurrected by Hades, Prince Alrik learned that he had become King {{after the death of}} his father. Alrik sought vengeance against Kratos, and his barbarian horde threatened to overwhelm Kratos' opposing Spartan army. Alrik almost killed Kratos in combat, but this was undone at the critical moment when Kratos offered up his life to Ares and was returned to battle equipped with the Blades of Chaos, which Kratos used to decapitate Alrik. Alrik eventually fought <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Underworld, and intent on revenge, found and confronted Kratos on the Island of Creation. Kratos killed the Barbarian King once again, and took his hammer. The character was voiced by Bob Joles in God of War II, and Fred Tatasciore in God of War III during the psyche sequence.|$|E

5|$|The portal {{takes the}} marine {{directly}} into Hell, where he proceeds to fight {{his way through}} the large number of demons to the Soul Cube, defeating its demonic guardian. The marine is then able to reinitialize the teleportation equipment left by research expeditions into Hell and return to the Delta Labs. Betruger, however, tells the marine that although the main UAC teleporter has been destroyed, Hell is opening a Hellmouth on Mars, capable of bringing millions of demons to Mars. Further in the Delta Labs, the marine encounters the injured Swann. Swann informs the marine that Kelly has been working with Hell for possibly the whole time, and has been transformed by the demons. Telling the marine that Campbell has gone after Kelly, Swann gives the marine his PDA containing information on the location on the Hellmouth under the surface of Mars and assures him that he will try to make <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the base alone.|$|E
25|$|Borges imagines a Tlönite working <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the problem}} of solipsism by {{reasoning}} that if all people are actually aspects of one being, then perhaps the universe is consistent because that one being is consistent in his imagining. This is, effectively, a near-reconstruction of the Berkeleyan God: perhaps not omnipresent, but bringing together all perceptions that do, indeed, occur.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. H. A {{man like}} that thinks of nothing but the short cut to <b>his</b> own <b>way.</b> [Looking <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the window towards the rise] If he buys the Centry and puts up chimneys, we simply couldn't stop here.|$|R

25|$|Harry Smith finally fought <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Fort Cox {{with the}} help of the local Cape Mounted Riflemen, but found that he had alienated most of his local allies. His {{policies}} had made enemies of the Burghers and Boer Commandos, the Fengu, and the Khoi, who formed much of the Cape's local defences. Even some of the Cape Mounted Riflemen refused to fight.|$|E
25|$|In 1642 he {{was arrested}} in Nejapa, Oaxaca by the Inquisition, accused of saying mass without being ordained. He managed to escape, but a few months later he turned himself in to the Inquisition in Mexico City.

Naturally, he used this {{opportunity}} to escape again and continue his escapades.|$|E

This action was never adequately explained, as the Royal compound and Ayutthaya proper was located on an island; how Taksin and his followers fought {{their way out of the}} Burmese encirclement remains a mystery.|$|E
5000|$|A middle-order batsman, Walsh {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Oxford University in 1966, scoring 56 against Hampshire {{in his second}} match, {{but was unable to}} maintain his form and lost his place in the side.

He played all 15 of Oxford's matches, scoring 325 runs at an average of 16.25 with a top score of 46.|$|R
60|$|Averil {{would have}} rushed to Mary {{with the whole}} story, but for Leonard's solemn asseveration that if ever {{it came to the}} ears of any one of the Mays, he should send back his rifle to Mr. Ernescliffe, and work <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> to one <b>of</b> the colonies rather than again look any of the family in the face.|$|R
50|$|He scored Fiorentina's first UEFA Cup goal against FC Groningen {{and scored}} crucial goals against Atalanta and Parma which allowed Fiorentina to surpass AC Milan {{for the final}} Champions League spot. In the 2008-09 season Semioli was widely {{believed}} to be on <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> because <b>of</b> the tactic change {{and the arrival of}} players such as Stevan Jovetic. However, after season ending injuries to Adrian Mutu and Mario Santana, Semioli found <b>his</b> <b>way</b> back onto the first team, and was a valuable asset to Gilardino, providing him with many crosses and being a terror on the wings.|$|R
