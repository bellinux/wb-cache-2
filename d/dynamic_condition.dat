60|$|It {{should be}} a relief to {{them to be able}} to look on it no longer as {{something}} ugly and hateful, a blot on nature, but as an illusion, a mistake, an unconscious crime, so to speak, that has for its motive the noblest passion that animals know--that sublime courage and daring which they exhibit in defence of a distressed companion. This fiery spirit in animals, which makes them forget their own safety, moves our hearts by its close resemblance to one of the most highly-prized human virtues; just as we are moved to intellectual admiration by the wonderful migratory instinct in birds that simulates some of the highest achievements of the mind of man. And we know that this beautiful instinct is also liable to mistakes--that many travellers leave us annually never to return. Such a mistake was undoubtedly the cause of the late visitation of Pallas' sand-grouse: owing perhaps to some unusual atmospheric or <b>dynamic</b> <b>condition,</b> or to some change in the nervous system of the birds, they deviated widely from their usual route, to scatter in countless thousands over the whole of Europe and perish slowly in climates not suited to them; while others, overpassing the cold strange continent, sped on over colder, stranger seas, to drop at last like aerolites, quenching their lives in the waves.|$|E
60|$|Thus he {{had come}} down, foreseeing with {{confidence}} how almost everything would be in his familiar little world; fearing, indeed, {{that there would be}} no surprises in his visit. But he had found that humdrum world in a terribly <b>dynamic</b> <b>condition,</b> in which even badinage and lyrism had turned explosive; and the first day of this visit had become the most fatal epoch of his life. The next morning he felt so harassed with the nightmare of consequences--he dreaded so much the immediate issues before him--that seeing while he breakfasted the arrival of the Riverston coach, he went out hurriedly and took his place on it, that he might be relieved, at least for a day, from the necessity of doing or saying anything in Middlemarch. Will Ladislaw was in one of those tangled crises which are commoner in experience than one might imagine, from the shallow absoluteness of men's judgments. He had found Lydgate, for whom he had the sincerest respect, under circumstances which claimed his thorough and frankly declared sympathy; and the reason why, in spite of that claim, it would have been better for Will to have avoided all further intimacy, or even contact, with Lydgate, was precisely of the kind to make such a course appear impossible. To a creature of Will's susceptible temperament--without any neutral region of indifference in his nature, ready to turn everything that befell him into the collisions of a passionate drama--the revelation that Rosamond had made her happiness in any way dependent on him was a difficulty which his outburst of rage towards her had immeasurably increased for him. He hated his own cruelty, and yet he dreaded to show the fulness of his relenting: he must go to her again; the friendship could not be put to a sudden end; and her unhappiness was a power which he dreaded. And all the while there was no more foretaste of enjoyment in the life before him than if his limbs had been lopped off and he was making his fresh start on crutches. In the night he had debated whether he should not get on the coach, not for Riverston, but for London, leaving a note to Lydgate which would give a makeshift reason for his retreat. But there were strong cords pulling him back from that abrupt departure: the blight on his happiness in thinking of Dorothea, the crushing of that chief hope which had remained in spite of the acknowledged necessity for renunciation, was too fresh a misery for him to resign himself to it and go straightway into a distance which was also despair.|$|E

50|$|Choked flow is a fluid <b>dynamic</b> <b>condition</b> {{associated}} with the Venturi effect. When a flowing fluid at a given pressure and temperature passes through a restriction (such as the throat of a convergent-divergent nozzle or a valve in a pipe) into a lower pressure environment the fluid velocity increases. At initially subsonic upstream conditions, the conservation of mass principle requires the fluid velocity to increase as it flows through the smaller cross-sectional area of the restriction. At the same time, the Venturi effect causes the static pressure, and therefore the density, to decrease downstream beyond the restriction. Choked flow is a limiting condition where the mass flow will not increase with a further decrease in the downstream pressure environment while upstream pressure is fixed. Note that the limited parameter is velocity, and thus mass flow can be increased with increased upstream pressure (increased fluid density).|$|E

40|$|The role {{of memory}} in visual search has lately become a {{controversial}} issue. Horowitz and Wolfe (1998) observed that {{performance in a}} visual search task was little affected by whether the stimuli were static or randomly relocated every 111 ms.

However, Horowitz and Wolfe could not effectively {{rule out the possibility that}} observers adopted a different strategy in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>condition</b> than in the static condition. That is, in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>condition</b> observers may have attended to a subregion of the display and waited for the target to appear there (sit-and-wait strategy).

40|$|Horowitz and Wolfe (1998, 2003) have {{challenged}} {{the view that}} serial visual search involves memory processes that keep track of already inspected locations.

In addition to measuring search reaction times, observers' eye movements were recorded. For target-present trials, the search rates were near-identical in the two search conditions, replicating Horowitz and Wolfe's findings.

40|$|Abstract—An {{experiment}} {{was performed to}} measure how dynamic changes in a target talker location affect speech perception in a complex multi-talker environment. The listener’s task was to report a number sequence spoken by the target talker, masked by four distractor talkers differing in their voices and spatial locations. The location of the target was either fixed during a trial (static condition) or randomly changing from one number {{to the next one}} (<b>dynamic</b> <b>condition).</b> The distractor talker locations were always randomized between numbers. A cue word sequence spoken by the target speaker with no distractors preceded each trial. The cue indicated the voice (<b>dynamic</b> <b>condition)</b> or the voice and location (static condition) of the target. A large decrease in performance was observed in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>condition</b> compared to the static condition. The position of the target number in a sequence, as well as the inter-word interval, only had a small effect on performance. The decrease in performance in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>condition</b> is either due to a cost of switching attention from one location to another, which can be large when attention is controlled by audition, or due to a change in listeners ’ strategy from selective focusing to one location (in static condition) to attempting to process all stimuli concurrently (in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>condition).</b> I...|$|E

An ad hoc robotic device was used to study the <b>dynamic</b> <b>condition.</b> Design: Observational study. Patients: Six children with hemiplegia and 6 young adults. Methods: Kinematics of the trunk and arm were studied using an optoelectronic system. In the <b>dynamic</b> <b>condition</b> the target object, a cup, was moved by the robotic device along clockwise and counterclockwise circular trajectories. Results: Two main strategies were used to study the onset and offset of shoulder and elbow movements and their maximum velocities. The hand velocity profile was bell-shaped in the static condition and compatible with ramp movements for the more affected side in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>condition.</b> The time to object contact was higher for the more affected side in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>condition.</b> The temporal coordination index illustrated an immature and less flexible behaviour in children’s reaching in all the examined conditions.

40|$|The {{attitude}} {{accuracy of}} star sensors decreases rapidly when star images become motion-blurred under <b>dynamic</b> <b>conditions.</b> To improve {{the performance of}} star sensors, the attitude-correlated frames (ACF) approach concentrating on {{the features of the}} attitude transforms of the adjacent star image frames, was proposed recently. It is effective in removing random noises and improving the attitude accuracy of the star sensor under different <b>dynamic</b> <b>conditions</b> and noise gray levels. In this paper, a further research on the performance analysis of the ACF approach for star sensors is presented to show its advantages and clarify its application limitations as well. With the ACF method, a much larger star image frame is obtained through the combination of adjacent frames. By increasing the number of frames N, much more information of star frames can be applied to estimate the attitude, the ACF approach therefore can output the attitude information continuously when the current techniques fail to work under highly <b>dynamic</b> <b>conditions.</b> However, the increase of computational consumption is small and acceptable for the star sensor. Since the distribution features of noises will change during the process and the error of the strap down gyro unit increases with the correlation time, an accuracy limitation will occur. The analyses are validated with simulations and experimental data. As a result, the attitude accuracy and robustness of a star sensor increase under highly <b>dynamic</b> <b>conditions.</b> These performance improvements can allow the use of star sensors during maneuvering and other <b>dynamic</b> <b>conditions</b> for satellites, spacecraft, ballistic missiles, and ships...|$|R
