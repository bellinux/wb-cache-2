40|$|Since the <b>heating</b> <b>substation</b> plays a {{key role}} in {{transferring}} the thermal energy from the primary network to the secondary network and controlling the heat output of district heating system to meet the thermal load, high operation performance of <b>heating</b> <b>substation</b> is essential for energy conservation, cost saving and emission reduction. The dynamic operation stability of <b>heating</b> <b>substation</b> is a very important dynamic characteristic of <b>heating</b> <b>substation</b> and largely affects the operation efficiency of district heating system. The operation instability of <b>heating</b> <b>substation</b> mainly manifest as flow rate and pressure oscillations, which will deteriorate the network hydraulic condition, break the network thermal balance, reduce the consumer comfort and increase the energy cost of the pumping system. Since heating substations will easily operate unstably under some conditions, this paper presents a theoretical method to analyze the stability and retune the feedback controller for operation stability of <b>heating</b> <b>substation.</b> Mathematical model of the plate heat exchanger was established and the feedback control theory was adopted to study the operation stability of <b>heating</b> <b>substation.</b> Based on the mathematical model and feedback control theory, a stability criterion was proposed for analyzing the operation stability of district <b>heating</b> <b>substation</b> effectively. The dynamic model of plate heat exchanger was validated with measured data. Simulation results show that controller tuned at certain operating condition can’t ensure operation stability of <b>heating</b> <b>substation,</b> when operating condition varies in large range. The stability analysis method proposed in this paper can be applied to analyzing the operation stability and tuning the controller of <b>heating</b> <b>substation</b> to enhance the operation stability...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLowering the {{district}} heating supply temperature {{is crucial for}} improving {{the efficiency of the}} heat network. A developed concept of fourth generation low temperature district heating with supply temperature just above the required end user conditions allows for heat loss reduction, increases the plant room efficiency and enables the integration of alternative energy source for heat production. Due to the lowered temperature approach the cost of the in-house substation increases. This paper presents analysis of the cost increase of the in-house <b>heat</b> <b>substation</b> to enable the cost-benefit analysis of next generation district heating systems while considering new and refurbished systems. Heat transfer calculation software tool has been used to analyse the cost increased of the substation due to required high performance of the plate heat exchanger while considering {{that the rest of the}} components are the same model/size, including heat meter, control valve and pipework.

40|$|This thesis gives {{a summary}} of {{different}} faults that occur in district <b>heating</b> <b>substations</b> and suggests ways of detecting them. The {{aim of the research}} has been to achieve fault detection using only the heat meter and the sensors connected to it, namely two temperature sensors and one flow meter. The incentive for fault detecting district <b>heating</b> <b>substations</b> comes from an effort to keep them in proper working order so as {{to be able to keep}} a low return temperature in the network and thus be able to lower the supply temperature. Hypothetically, if the supply temperature in Sweden were lowered by only one degree, the annual savings would be about SEK 50 million. The thesis also entails brief accounts of district heating and heat metering along with two models of heat exchangers. The first paper in this thesis presents a way of fault detecting the temperature sensors by detecting the noise amplitude. The second paper describes how to separate the energy usage for heating and domestic hot water production using only one heat meter. Energy separation is very interesting, since separate measurement of domestic hot water energy usage and heating usage is recommended by the Swedish National Board of Housing, Building and Planning. The third paper describes how to estimate hot water consumption using the hot water energy consumption and measurement of cold water and hot water temperature. It also contains an error analysis of the estimate. The error analysis suggests that the estimate using a class 1 heat meter is as accurate as the measurement using a class- 3 flow meter. Thus, the two estimation methods presented can be used instead of installing extra heat meters or flow meters. This makes it possible to implement the separate measurement(s) according to the recommended guidelines at a lower cost. Godkänd; 2005; 20060922 (ysko) Fjärrvärm...|$|R

40|$|Many {{machines}} {{in these days}} have sensors to collect information from the world they inhabit. The correctness of this information is crucial for the correct operation. However, at times sensors are not so reliable since they are sometimes affected of some type of noise and thus give incorrect information. Another drawback might be lack of information due to shortage of existing sensors. Sensor fusion is trying to overcome these drawbacks by integrating or combining information from multiple sensors. The heating of a building is a slow and time consuming process, i. e. either the flow or energy consumption are object to drastically changes. On the other hand, the tap water system, i. e. the heating of tap water can be the source to severe changes in both flow and energy consumption. This because of that the flow is stochastic in the tap water system, {{at any given time}} a tap may be opened or closed and therefore drastically change the flow.

40|$|AbstractCurrent {{temperature}} {{levels in}} European district heating networks {{are still too}} high with respect to future conditions as customer heat demands decrease and new possible heat source options emerge. A considerable reduction of temperature levels {{can be accomplished by}} eliminating current faults in <b>substations</b> and customer <b>heating</b> systems. These faults do not receive proper attention today, because neither <b>substations</b> nor customer <b>heating</b> systems are centrally supervised. The focus of this paper has been to identify these faults by annual series of hourly meter readings obtained from automatic meter reading systems at 135 substations in two Swedish district heating systems. Based on threshold methods, various faults were identified in 74 % of the substations. The identified faults were divided into three different fault groups: Unsuitable heat load pattern, low average annual temperature difference, and poor substation control. The most important conclusion from this early study of big data volumes is that automatic meter reading systems can provide proactive fault detection by continuous commissioning of district <b>heating</b> <b>substations</b> in the future. A complete reduction of current faults corresponds to approximately half the required reduction of the current temperature levels in the effort toward future low-temperature district heating networks...|$|R
40|$|Fault {{detection}} and diagnostics (FDD) of district <b>heating</b> <b>substations</b> (DHS) are important activities because malfunctioning components {{can lead to}} incorrect billing and waste of energy. Although FDD has been an activate research area for nearly two decades, only a few simple tools are commonly deployed in the district energy industry. Some of the methods proposed in the literature are promising, but their complexity may prevent broader application. Other methods require sensor data that are not commonly available, or cannot be expected to function well in practice due to oversimplification. Here we present two basic methods for improved FDD and data validation that are compatible with the data acquisition systems that are commonly used today. We propose that correlation analysis {{can be used to}} identify substations with similar supply temperatures and that the corresponding temperature difference is a useful quantity for FDD. The second method is a limit- checking approach for the validation of thermal power usage, which is sensitive to faults affecting both the primary flow and temperature sensors in a DHS. These methods are suitable for automated FDD and are demonstrated with hourly data provided by a Swedish district energy company. Godkänd; 2012; 20121122 (ysko...|$|R

40|$|The studies {{presented}} in this thesis concern hydronic space heating systems connected via heat exchangers to a district heating network: referred to as an indirect connection. The objective has been to improve the reliability of district heat supplies and to lower the return temperature from consumer substations. Two of the disadvantages of an indirect connection have been addressed: the thermodynamic loss and the local dependency on electricity involved during {{the use of a}} heat exchanger. The results show that the influence of these disadvantages can be reduced by employing several variants of so-called low-flow procedures in hydronic heating systems. Concerning the reliability of district heat supplies, the present work has led to new knowledge regarding the dependence of the district heating technology on electricity. A substantial heat supply can be maintained in numerous buildings in case of an electric power failure since natural circulation can be expected to take place in the heating systems. A turbine-driven circulation pump has the potential to further reduce the dependence on electricity. Concerning a low return temperature from consumer substations, which is a key performance measure for district <b>heating</b> <b>substations,</b> a new method for the control of the heating system has demonstrated a potential of reducing the district heating return temperature.

40|$|The idea of {{district}} heating is {{to heat up}} a whole district from a central source through a distribution network. The heat is extracted by heat exchangers and the water is then subsequently returned to the central source. The heat exchange between the district heating network and the building occurs in district heating substations. Heat meters are located in such substations and are divided into two main categories depending on their heat energy estimation frequency modes. Which are either constant or flow rate dependent. The Swedish district heating industry is a business with revenue of approximately 19. 8 billion SEK (as of the year 2002). Considering an error of 1 % in energy delivered, that is a loss of 198 million SEK, which justifies the current research. The accuracy in heat measurement for billing purposes is {{then one of the}} major reasons for conducting this research. Few studies have been done in this area. A Swedish study shows that the major causes of the errors are: flow meters, temperature sensors, integrating units, lightning, control systems, valves, leaks in heat exchangers and the dynamic heat demand imposed on the district <b>heating</b> <b>substation.</b> I have chosen to study the heat measurement errors due to dynamic load imposed on the district <b>heating</b> <b>substation</b> because they are the least investigated and presumably account for {{a substantial portion of the}} total error. I have delimited my research area to include single family houses, since the effects of dynamic heat load on heat metering are more important in this kind of dwelling. A major tool in the investigation has been simulations based on a Simulink model, of a district <b>heating</b> <b>substation</b> and a house. For this purpose, the simulation model has been extended to handle new heat measurement strategies. A district heating laboratory was built at Luleå University of Technology to test not only the accuracy of different heat measurement algorithms but also control and diagnosis methods. Based on analysis of the measurement strategies, an adaptive algorithm and a feed-forward method are proposed in this thesis to reduce the heat measurement errors due to the dynamic heat demand imposed on the substation. Simulations conducted show that the adaptive algorithm has a higher measurement accuracy than both kinds of existing heat meters. The feed-forward method has the highest measurement accuracy compared to both kinds of existing heat meters and the adaptive algorithm. Godkänd; 2006; 20061116 (pafi) Fjärrvärm...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a new alternative control approach for indirectly connected district heating substations. Simulations {{results showed that}} the new approach results in an increased [Delta]T across the substation. Results were obtained for both ideal and non-ideal operation of the system, meaning that less water must be pumped through the district heating network, and a higher overall fuel efficiency can be obtained in the district heating power plants. When a higher fuel efficiency is achieved, the usage of primary fuel sources can be reduced. Improved efficiency also increases the effective heat transfer capacity of a district heating network, allowing more customers to be connected to an existing network without increasing the heating plant or network capacity. Also, if combined heat and power plants are used to produce the heat, the increased [Delta]T will result in a further improved overall fuel efficiency, as more electricity can be produced with colder cooling water. The idea behind the new control method is to consider the temperature of the water supplying the district <b>heating</b> <b>substation</b> with heat, {{often referred to as the}} primary supply temperature. This represents a logical next step, as currently, the only parameter generally taken into account or measured when controlling the temperature level of the radiator circuit is the local outdoor temperature.

40|$|AbstractFuture {{smart energy}} grids {{will require more}} {{information}} exchange between interfaces in the energy system. One interface where dearth of information exists is in district <b>heating</b> <b>substations,</b> being the interfaces between the distribution network and the customer building heating systems. Previously, manual meter readings were collected once or {{a few times a}} year. Today, automatic meter readings are available resulting in low cost hourly meter reading data. In a district heating system, errors and deviations in customer substations propagates through the network to the heat supply plants. In order to reduce future customer and heat supplier costs, a demand appears for smart functions identifying errors and deviations in the substations. Hereby, also a research demand appears for defining normal and abnormal heat load patterns in customer substations. The main purpose with this article is to perform an introductory analysis of several high resolution measurements in order to provide valuable information about substations for creating future applications in smart heat grids. One year of hourly heat meter readings from 141 substations in two district heating networks were analysed. The connected customer buildings were classified into five different customer categories and four typical heat load patterns were identified. Two descriptive parameters, annual relative daily variation and annual relative seasonal variation, were defined from each 1 year sequence for identifying normal and abnormal heat load patterns. The three major conclusions are associated both with the method used and the objects analysed. First, normal heat load patterns vary with applied control strategy, season, and customer category. Second, it is possible to identify obvious outliers compared to normal heat loads with the two descriptive parameters used in this initial analysis. Third, the developed method can probably be enhanced by redefining the customer categories by their indoor activities...|$|R
