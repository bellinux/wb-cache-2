25|$|The Taming of the Shrew in {{performance}} {{has had an}} uneven history. Popular in Shakespeare's day, the play fell out of favour during the seventeenth century, when it was replaced on the stage by John Lacy's Sauny the Scott. The original Shakespearean text was {{not performed at all}} during the eighteenth century, with David Garrick's adaptation Catharine and Petruchio dominating the stage. After over two hundred years without a performance, the play returned to the British stage in 1844, the last Shakespeare play restored to the repertory. However, {{it was only in the}} 1890s that the dominance of Catharine and Petruchio began to wain, and productions of The Shrew become more regular. Moving into the twentieth century, the play's popularity increased considerably, and it became one of Shakespeare's most frequently staged plays, with productions taking place all over the world. This trend has continued <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>twenty-first</b> century, with the play as popular now as it was when first written.|$|E

25|$|Music {{and singing}} were {{important}} in England during the medieval period, {{being used in}} religious ceremonies, court occasions and to accompany theatrical works. Singing techniques called gymel were introduced in England in the thirteenth century, accompanied by instruments such as the guitar, harp, pipes and organ. Henry IV sponsored an extensive range of music in England, while his son Henry V brought back many influences from occupied France. Carols became an important form of music in the fifteenth century; originally these had been a song sung during a dance with a prominent refrain — the fifteenth century form lost the dancing and introduced strong religious overtones. Ballads were also popular from the late fourteenth century, including the Ballad of Chevy Chase and others describing the activities of Robin Hood. Miracle plays were performed to communicate the Bible in various locations. By the late fourteenth century, these had been extended into vernacular mystery plays which performed annually over several days, broken up into various cycles of plays; a handful have survived <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>twenty-first</b> century. Guilds competed to produce the best plays in each town and performances were often an expression of civic identity.|$|E
25|$|Examples {{of most of}} {{the stages}} of the Architecture of the United Kingdom from the mediaeval era onwards are present in the city.

The Tudor period saw several large mansions and estates being built for wealthy merchants outside the traditional city centre. Almshouses and public houses {{for the rest of the}} population remain mixed in amongst areas of more recent development. In the eighteenth century, several squares were laid out for the prosperous middle classes in the expanding suburbs which grew to take in many of the surrounding villages. The development of the floating harbour provided a focus for industrial development and the local transport infrastructure including the Clifton Suspension Bridge and Temple Meads railway station, the original part of which was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. The twentieth century saw further expansion of the city, with the growth of the University of Bristol buildings and the aircraft industry.

500|$|The {{controversy}} over who was {{primarily responsible for}} aspirin's development spread {{through much of the}} twentieth century and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>twenty-first.</b> Although aspirin's origin was in academic research and Bayer was not the first to synthesize it, as of 2016 Bayer still described Hoffman as having [...] "discovered a pain-relieving, fever-lowering and anti-inflammatory substance." [...] Historians and others have also challenged Bayer's early accounts of Bayer's synthesis, in which Hoffmann was primarily responsible for the Bayer breakthrough. In 1949, shortly before his death, Eichengrün wrote an article, [...] "Fifty Years of Asprin", claiming that he had not told Hoffmann the purpose of his research, meaning that Hoffmann merely carried out Eichengrün's research plan, and that the drug would never have gone to the market without his direction. This claim was later supported by research conducted by historian Walter Sneader. Axel Helmstaedter, General Secretary of the International Society for the History of Pharmacy, subsequently questioned the novelty of Sneader’s research, noting that several earlier articles discussed the Hoffmann–Eichengrün controversy in detail. Bayer countered Sneader in a press release stating that according to the records, Hoffmann and Eichengrün held equal positions, and Eichengrün was not Hoffmann's supervisor. Hoffmann was named on the US Patent as the inventor, which Sneader did not mention. Eichengrün, who left Bayer in 1908, had multiple opportunities to claim the priority and had never before 1949 done it; he neither claimed nor received any percentage of the profit from aspirin sales.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, I {{will take}} the long view, and extend {{the issue of the}} {{sustainability}} of cities beyond 2050 <b>into</b> <b>the</b> late <b>twenty-first</b> century. First, I briefly review the development of “sustainability” discourse since the 1970 s, and the increasing concern with energy futures since the 1990 s. Then I summarize the evidence and analysis, from this literature, that fossil fuels will be depleted and increasingly costly or unavailable during this century, and that renewables in most regions cannot replace more than a fraction of this energy. Then I compare cities on their prospects for sustainability, with case studies of two major global cities. Finally, I consider some impacts on cities of energy depletion in the regional and global systems in which they are embedded.|$|R

Both reports offer guidance on how tomorrow’s research library can be best prepared to meet future challenges and opportunities. The author then uses themes generated from this review, along with his own experiences as a media librarian and archivist, to frame a discussion of how academic media centers around the nation are already actively engaged in imagining and transforming their institutions <b>into</b> <b>the</b> research library’s <b>twenty-first</b> century killer app. He ends by suggesting that research libraries look to media centers as models of how to be adaptive and innovative for twenty first century academic environment. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R

Within <b>the</b> context of this large-scale shift in human and state relations, one question that has often been asked by analysis is whether changing forms of insurgency are taking place.
