The design incorporated a number of innovations, including a new longitudinal <b>frame</b> <b>system</b> in the hull, the development of which delayed construction by three to four years. The hull form was also redesigned to improve efficiency, and a new clipper bow was used instead of the old cruiser ram bow.

40|$|A major {{objective}} of the U. S. Department of Energy {{is to have a}} zero energy commercial building by the year 2025. Windows have a major influence on the energy performance of the building envelope as they control over 55 % of building energy load, and represent one important area where technologies can be developed to save energy. Aluminum <b>framing</b> <b>systems</b> are used in over 80 % of commercial fenestration products (i. e. windows, curtain walls, store fronts, etc.). Aluminum <b>framing</b> <b>systems</b> are often required in commercial buildings because of their inherent good structural properties and long service life, which is required from commercial and architectural frames. At the same time, they are lightweight and durable, requiring very little maintenance, and offer design flexibility. An additional benefit of aluminum <b>framing</b> <b>systems</b> is their relatively low cost and easy manufacturability. Aluminum, being an easily recyclable material, also offers sustainable features. However, from energy efficiency point of view, aluminum frames have lower thermal performance due to the very high thermal conductivity of aluminum. Fenestration systems constructed of aluminum alloys therefore have lower performance in terms of being effective barrier to energy transfer (heat loss or gain). Despite the lower energy performance, aluminum is the choice material for commercial <b>framing</b> <b>systems</b> and dominates the commercial/architectural fenestration market because of the reasons mentioned above. In addition, there is no other cost effective and energy efficient replacement material available to take place of aluminum in the commercial/architectural market. Hence it is imperative to improve the performance of aluminum <b>framing</b> <b>system</b> to improve the energy performance of commercial fenestration system and in turn reduce the energy consumption of commercial building and achieve zero energy building by 2025. The {{objective of}} this project was to develop high performance, energy efficient commercial fenestration <b>framing</b> <b>systems,</b> by investigating new technologies that would improve the thermal performance of aluminum frames, while maintaining their structural and life-cycle performance. The project targeted an improvement of over 30 % (whole window performance) over conventional commercial framing technology by improving the performance of commercial <b>framing</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In United States design practice, three system {{performance}} factors (R, Cd, and o) characterize the inelastic behavior of structures {{and are a}} crucial component of common elastic design methodologies. However, for steel-concrete composite <b>frame</b> <b>systems</b> these factors have been selected based on comparisons to more traditional and well-studied reinforced concrete and structural steel <b>frame</b> <b>systems,</b> without significant quantitative justification. In this study, the seismic behavior of steel-concrete composite moment and braced frames is investigated and rational {{system performance}} factors are developed. A set of archetype frames, selected to {{be representative of the}} range of frames seen in practice, were designed according to current design specifications. Using a suite of new finite element formulations for composite systems, nonlinear static pushover and transient dynamic analyses were performed on the frames. The results of the analyses served as statistical data on the seismic response from which the performance factors were quantified. The results from this investigation enable {{a better understanding of the}} variability in collapse performance of composite <b>frame</b> <b>systems</b> and will facilitate more effective designs of these systems...|$|R
