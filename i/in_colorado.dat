5|$|Gold strikes {{from the}} mid-19th to early 20thcenturies {{played a major}} role in {{attracting}} settlers to the upper Colorado River basin. In 1859, a group of adventurers from Georgia discovered gold along the Blue River <b>in</b> <b>Colorado</b> and established the mining boomtown of Breckenridge. During 1875, even bigger strikes were made along the Uncompahgre and San Miguel rivers, also <b>in</b> <b>Colorado,</b> and these led to the creation of Ouray and Telluride, respectively. Because most gold deposits along the upper Colorado River and its tributaries occur in lode deposits, extensive mining systems and heavy machinery were required to extract them. Mining remains a substantial contributor to the economy of the upper basin and has led to acid mine drainage problems in some regional streams and rivers.|$|E
