5|$|Modern human {{settlement}} {{of what is}} now Rwanda dates from, at the latest, the last glacial period, either in the Neolithic period around 8000 BC, or in the long humid period which followed, up to around 3000 BC. Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of sparse settlement by hunter gatherers in the late stone age, followed by a larger population of early Iron Age settlers, who produced <b>dimpled</b> pottery and iron tools. These early inhabitants were the ancestors of the Twa, aboriginal pygmy hunter-gatherers who remain in Rwanda today. Between 700 BC and 1500 AD, a number of Bantu groups migrated into Rwanda, clearing forest land for agriculture. The forest-dwelling Twa lost much of their habitat and moved to the mountain slopes. Historians have several theories regarding the nature of the Bantu migrations; one theory is that the first settlers were Hutu, while the Tutsi migrated later to form a distinct racial group, possibly of Nilo-hamitic origin. An alternative theory is that the migration was slow and steady, with incoming groups integrating into rather than conquering the existing society. Under this theory, the Hutu and Tutsi distinction arose later and was a class distinction rather than a racial one.|$|E

40|$|The fluid {{force on}} a sphere with <b>dimples</b> has been {{investigated}} in Reynolds number range from 0. 4 × 105 to 1. 7 × 105. Two spheres of diameter 42. 6 and 100 mm were studied with 328 <b>dimples</b> on their surface. In the present study, the <b>dimples</b> {{in the form of}} three types (arc, cone and trapezoid type) were used. And more, the depth ratio of arc type <b>dimple</b> (k/d) (k: the depth of <b>dimple,</b> d: the diameter of sphere) was changed from 0. 0018 to 0. 0188. The drag on a sphere with <b>dimples</b> was measured using a three components load cell with a strain gage. The pressure distribution around a sphere with <b>dimples</b> was measured using a semiconductor pressure transducer. The flow pattern around a sphere with <b>dimples</b> was visualized with the spark tracing method.

40|$|AbstractThe {{numerical}} analysis {{is carried out}} to study the flow physics of effect of <b>dimple</b> depth on heat transfer and fluid flow. The <b>dimple</b> diameter is 5 cm kept constant. While <b>dimple</b> depth is varied as 10 mm, 15 mm and 20 mm, so that <b>dimple</b> depth to <b>dimple</b> diameter ratio is maintained as 0. 2, 0. 3 and 0. 4. The channel is having aspect ratio of 4 kept constant. The {{numerical analysis}} is carried out at Reynolds number based on hydraulic diameter of 20, 000. Fluent 6. 3. 26, a finite volume flow solver is used for solving governing equations for present geometry. The cell count is based on grid independence study and y+ value. Appropriate boundary conditions are imposed under forced heat convection mode [...] The fluid flow characteristics are presented {{in the form of}} velocity contours. The numerical analysis clarifies the flow structure due to <b>dimple</b> surface. The heat transfer enhancement because of <b>dimple</b> surface is due to flow separation at the leading edge and reattachment at the trailing edge of the <b>dimple.</b> For the <b>dimple</b> depth δ/D= 0. 3, the augmented strength and intensity of secondary vortices increases the rate of heat transfer enhancement compared to <b>dimple</b> depth δ/D= 0. 2 and δ/D= 0. 4. The heat transfer enhancement rate for <b>dimple</b> depth δ/D= 0. 4 decreases due to strong recirculation zone within the <b>dimple</b> and some fluid is trapped {{at the bottom of the}} <b>dimple...</b>|$|R

30|$|A novel method, named “ball dimpling”, {{has been}} used to detect {{subsurface}} damage in machining of optical parts. The method was developed by the Optical Manufacturing Center of the University of Rochester [28, 29]. Similar to the traditional taper polishing method, the ball <b>dimpling</b> method polishes a sample part with a steel ball to make a <b>dimple</b> in order to expose the subsurface damage of the part. The depth of the <b>dimple</b> is large enough so as to cross the damage layer to the matrix. The depth of SSD is calculated by measuring the characteristic dimensions of the <b>dimple.</b> There are also some other forms of <b>dimpling</b> [30]. The ball <b>dimpling</b> method is simple in operation and low in cost. However, the scratches in a <b>dimpling</b> process may remain on the part surface, which can result in measurement errors. Additionally, the ball <b>dimpling</b> method is time consuming in SSD measurements for the parts made of hard materials due to a low <b>dimpling</b> efficiency [31].|$|R

Burton's idea was to use an all-black suit, and was met with positive feedback by Bob Kane. Jon Peters wanted to use a Nike product placement with the Batsuit. Ringwood studied over 200 comic book issues for inspiration. 28 sculpted latex designs were created; 25 different cape looks and 6 different heads were made, accumulating a total cost of $250,000. Comic book fans initially expressed negative feedback against the Batsuit. Burton opted not to use tights, spandex, or underpants as seen in the comic book, feeling it was not intimidating. Prosthetic makeup designer Nick Dudman used acrylic-based makeup paint called PAX for Nicholson's chalk-white face. Part of Nicholson's contract was approval over the makeup designer.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine whether <b>dimples</b> on a heat sink fin can increase heat transfer for laminar airflows.

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to study the effects of <b>dimple</b> depth and duct converging angle on the endwall heat transfer and friction factor in this pin fin wedge duct. Design/methodology/approach - The study is carried out by using the numerical simulations. The diameter of <b>dimples</b> is the same as the pin fin diameter with an inline manner arrangement in relation to the pin fin. The ratio between <b>dimple</b> depth and <b>dimple</b> diameter is varied from 0 to 0. 3 and the converging angle is ranging from 0 ° to 12. 7 °. The Reynolds number is between 10, 000 and 50, 000. Results of the endwall Nusselt number, friction factor, and flow structures are included. For convenience of comparison, the pin fin wedge duct with a converging angle of 12. 7 ° without <b>dimples</b> is considered as the baseline. Findings - It is found that the <b>dimples</b> can effectively enhance the endwall heat transfer due to the impingement on the <b>dimple</b> surface, reattachment downstream the <b>dimple</b> and recirculation in front of the pin fin leading edge. By increasing the converging angle, the heat transfer is also increased but with a large friction factor penalty. In addition, the heat transfer enhancement for deep depth cases is 1. 57 times higher than that of the low depth case. The thermal performance indicates that the intensity of heat transfer enhancement depends upon the <b>dimple</b> depth and converging angle. Originality/value - It suggests that the endwall heat transfer in a pin fin wedge duct can be increase by the adoption of <b>dimples.</b> The optimal <b>dimple</b> relative depth is 0. 2 with low friction factor and high heat transfer performance...|$|R
