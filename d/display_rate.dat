50|$|A meta {{analysis}} of 27 species found that qualities such as lekking size, male <b>display</b> <b>rate,</b> {{and the rate}} of male aggression exhibit positive correlation with male success rates. A positive correlation was also found between attendance, magnitude of exaggerated traits, age, frequency of fights, and mating success. This female preference leads to mating skew, with some males being more successful at copulating with females. The variation in mating success is quite large in lek mating systems with 70-80 percent of matings being attributed to only 10%-20% of the males present.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} shown that the hair-pencil pheromones serve both as an aphrodisiac or {{tranquilizer}} for the female, but sometimes as a repellent to other conspecific males. In an experiment with heliothine moths, male hair-pencil compounds were extracted and tested against various male and female treatments. It was found that not one specific compound triggered a response in females, but a blend was required. Additionally it is thought that the specific ratio of each of the compounds found in the male moths helps females determine a suitable male from her species. Heliothine moths use similar hair-pencil compounds in different ratios and this is enough for the female to differentiate conspecifics from other species. Males are able to detect competitors through hair-pencil compounds, but extra competitors do not cause great increases in <b>display</b> <b>rate.</b> This perhaps is due to the suppressing effect of hair-pencil pheromones on competitors. Pheromones have also been demonstrated to show the age of the male. As males age the pheromone chemical ratios change slightly. Females can distinguish between males by these changes and pick a more suitable mate.|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} of multiple sexual traits remains controversial and poorly understood in evolutionary biology. In many bird species, males exhibit complex courtships involving feather ornaments and behavioral display. Multiple traits may convey {{information on the}} genetic and phenotypic quality of males. In particular, fixed characters, such as feather ornaments (produced once a year during the annual molt in many bird species) might convey information about past male condition (at the time of trait development); whereas flexible traits such as behavioral displays should be sensitive to present condition. Here we show that both flexible behavioral displays and fixed feather ornaments of peacocks, used by females to choose a mate, honestly reflect health status. Correlative data showed that peacocks with high <b>display</b> <b>rate</b> (the number of behavioral displays per hour) {{and a large number}} of tail eyespots had low levels of circulating heterophils, suggesting better health status. Experimental activation of the immune system, through LPS injection, significantly reduced <b>display</b> <b>rate</b> compared to a control group. However, the sensitivity of a male <b>display</b> <b>rate</b> to the immune challenge was dependent on the number of tail eyespots: males with higher number of tail eyespots were better able to cope with the experimental immune challenge, and maintained their <b>display</b> <b>rate</b> at levels closer to the levels performed before the immune activation. These results are consistent with the idea that multiple signaling might enhance information reliability...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three chapters on {{the economics of the}} Internet. The first chapter begins with presenting the advertising spending patterns of US local restaurants that have different ratings on Yelp. com. Rating information on Yelp includes display ratings and review distributions. The Yelp's rounding algorithm creates a discontinuity in display ratings. Therefore, I use a regression discontinuity design to identify the effect of a higher <b>display</b> <b>rating</b> on local restaurants' advertising spendings. I find a significantly negative effect of <b>display</b> <b>rating</b> for highly-rated restaurants on advertising. However, when the <b>display</b> <b>rating</b> is constant between two steps, the relationship between local restaurant advertising spending and average rating is significantly positive. The second chapter uses a game-theoretic model to analyze competing firms' advertising and pricing decisions. Here customer reviews are available and firms may build up loyal customer bases. I find that highly-rated firms are more likely to advertise more, i. e., online reviews complement advertising. Comparative static results can explain the results found in the first chapter. Intuitively, when the capacity of a local business becomes limited, a jump in the <b>display</b> <b>rating</b> will reduce the complementary effect of online reviews on advertising. I also analyze an extension of the model, where an entrant and an incumbent interact. I find that customer reviews undo the "fat-cat" effect of a large incumbent with lots of loyal customers. The third chapter proposes a new explanation for adoption failure or delay in markets with network effects. In the model, consumers and software providers play a dynamic adoption game. Each group of players choose between two incompatible technologies. Consumers may wait, but firms may not. Although efficiency requires one technology to be adopted by all consumers and firms right away, there is a "market split and adoption delay" equilibrium. In this equilibrium some consumers choose to wait at first and firms split between the two technologies. The model is motivated by the 56 K modem market, in which competition between two technologies appears to have led to adoption failure, until an industry standard setting organization coordinated the market on an alternative standard...|$|R
40|$|International audience: In {{their choice}} of mates, females may use {{alternative}} tactics, including a comparative assessment of males in a population, using one or several relative preference criteria. Traits involved in female choice should presumably be variable between, but not within males, thus potentially providing reliable cues of male identity and quality for prospecting females. In lekking species, sexual selection is usually intense, and females can freely choose mates. Studying the Little Bustard Tetrax tetrax, a bird with an exploded lek mating system, we first identified male phenotypic traits that showed higher among, than within variation (plumage pattern, <b>display</b> <b>rates</b> and call structure). Among those and other traits (ornaments and their symmetry, body condition, lek spatial organization and territory quality), we identified phenotypic traits that correlated with male attractiveness toward females. At least four phenotypic male traits were correlated with female attraction, i. e. body condition, lek attendance, ornamental symmetry and <b>display</b> <b>rates.</b> Traits related to the initial female attraction on male territory seem to differ from traits related to the decision of females {{to stay in the}} territory of attractive males...|$|R

40|$|Males in {{many species}} have complex, {{multicomponent}} sexual signals, {{and there may}} be trade-offs between different signal components. By adjusting their signaling behaviors, males may be able to produce more attractive courtship displays {{in the face of these}} trade-offs, but this possibility has rarely been tested. In this study, we examined adaptive adjustment of display behaviors during courtship in a lek-breeding bird, the greater sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). We measured the potential trade-off between display quantity (<b>display</b> <b>rate)</b> and quality (a temporal feature of displays) in a wild population of sage grouse using controlled approaches of a robotic female to experimentally induce changes in male <b>display</b> <b>rate.</b> We found that males who are more successful in mating can increase quantity without a decline in quality, with only unsuccessful males expressing an apparent trade-off. Male mating success was also positively correlated with responsiveness to changes in receiver distance, suggesting that successful males may avoid a trade-off by tactically adjusting their <b>display</b> <b>rate</b> [...] saving energy by displaying at low levels when females are farther away and at higher levels as females approach. Alternative explanations for this differential response to female proximity are discussed. Our results suggest that to be successful, males may need both the ability to produce attractive signals and the ability to effectively allocate their display effort by responding to female behaviors.

40|$|Mate choice cues in {{sage grouse}} were reinvestigated by {{analyzing}} relationships between male mating success {{and a range}} of suggested cues. Display cues were implicated by significant relationships between mating status (whether or not a male mated) and lek attendance, <b>display</b> <b>rate</b> (corrected for effects of female proximity and time of day) and an acoustic component related to temporal and frequency measures of a whistle emitted during the strut display. Although <b>display</b> <b>rate</b> and the acoustic component were intercorrelated, both exerted significant partial effects on mating success in multivariate analyses. These display measures also differed significantly between males. In contrast, mating success was not significantly related to measures of territory characteristics, including size and proximity to the lek center, or to body size. These results resolve discrepancies between previous studies and provide a basis for experimental analysis of the role of female choice in this lek system...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies of}} female choice in sage grouse Centrocercus urophasianus have implicated both the {{acoustic}} quality and repetition {{rate of the}} stereotyped strut display as putative cues for female choice. Stages in the choice process at which specific components of male courtship display influence female decisions were investigated using ﬁeld observations of female premating behavior. Females visited a subset of territorial males and then actively chose one of these as a mate. The order in which males were visited suggested that females searched until an acceptable mate was found, rather than employing a “best-of-n” tactic. Numbers of females visiting a male were related to differences in an acoustical component of display (inter-pop interval) whereas {{the probability that a}} visiting female mated was related to <b>display</b> <b>rate,</b> indicating that initial attraction and active choice are influenced by different components of display. In addition, inter-pop interval and <b>display</b> <b>rate</b> tended to covary inversely, suggesting that attraction and active choice may impose conflicting selection pressures on display performance...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDo all traits {{within an}} {{organism}} age {{for the same}} reason? Evolutionary theories of aging share a common assumption: the strength of natural selection declines with age. A corollary is that additive genetic variance should increase with age. However, not all senescent traits display such increases suggesting that other mechanisms may be at play. Using longitudinal data collected from more than 5400 houbara bustards (Chlamydotis undulata) with an exhaustive recorded pedigree, we investigated the genetics of aging in one female reproductive trait (egg production) and three male reproductive traits (courtship <b>display</b> <b>rate,</b> ejaculate size and sperm viability), that display senescence at the phenotypic level. Animal models revealed an increase in additive genetic variance with age for courtship <b>display</b> <b>rate</b> and egg production but an unexpected absence of increased additive genetic variance for ejaculate size and no additive genetic variance for sperm viability. Our {{results suggest that the}} mechanisms behind the senescence of some traits are linked with a change in genetic expression, whereas for some other traits, aging may result from the constraints associated with physiological wear and tear on the organism throughout the life of the individual...|$|E

40|$|Many animals signal their {{resource}} holding potential (RHP) {{to deter}} competitors from engaging them in potentially costly fights. Studies of this opponent assessment function have generated important insights into signal design and evolution. In {{the case of}} sounds, rate of production is often a salient feature. We used digital video playback to conduct analogous experiments exploring the importance of temporal variation in visual signals. Our study focused on the push-up display of male Jacky dragons Amphibolurus muricatus, an Australian agamid lizard. This stereotyped movement-based signal is commonly performed during male–male contests. A previous study has shown that Jacky dragons responses {{are influenced by the}} overall <b>display</b> <b>rate</b> of a video conspecific. We built upon this finding by investigating the effect of short-term variation in <b>display</b> <b>rate.</b> Each playback sequence varied systematically across a different combination of display parameters, while keeping the total number of push-ups constant. Other potential cues, such as morphology and the characteristics of individual motor patterns, were precisely controlled. The aggressive signalling and locomotor behaviour of subject males varied significantly between sequences. Most notably, performance of throat expansions, a typical agamid threat posture, was suppressed by video sequences with temporal clumping of displays. These results show that lizards are sensitive to differences in the temporal fine structure of display sequences and suggest that display concentration is an important assessment cue. 9 page(s...|$|E
