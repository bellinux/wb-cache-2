5|$|Before {{the start}} of the formal {{administration}} of Toraja villages by the Tana Toraja Regency, each Toraja village was autonomous. In a more complex situation, in which one Toraja family could not handle their problems alone, several villages formed a group; sometimes, villages would unite against other villages. Relationship between families was expressed through blood, marriage, and shared ancestral houses (tongkonan), practically signed by the exchange of water buffalo and pigs on ritual occasions. Such exchanges not only built political and cultural ties between families but defined each person's place in a social hierarchy: who poured palm wine, who wrapped a corpse and prepared offerings, where each person could or could not sit, what dishes should be used or avoided, and <b>even</b> <b>what</b> piece of meat constituted one's share.|$|E
25|$|The game {{eventually}} {{got under way}} on 26 March 1856. The Victorians, stung by criticism over the £1000 stake, argued over just about everything; the toss, who should bat first, whether different pitches {{should be used for}} the different innings and <b>even</b> <b>what</b> the umpires should wear.|$|E
25|$|The first life {{arose from}} abiotic {{chemical}} reactions. When this happened, how it happened, and <b>even</b> <b>what</b> planet {{it happened on}} are uncertain. However, life follows the rules of and arose from lifeless chemistry and physics. It is constrained by principles such as thermodynamics. This is an important concept in the field because it is represents the epitome of the interconnectedness, if not sameness, of life and Earth.|$|E

25|$|In some Baroque music neither split-chord nor triple-stop is {{appropriate}} and violinists will arpeggiate all chords (and <b>even</b> <b>what</b> {{appear to be}} regular double stops), playing all notes individually {{as if they had}} been written as a slurred figure. In some musical styles, a sustained open string drone can be played during a passage mainly written on an adjacent string, to provide a basic accompaniment. This is more often seen in folk traditions than in classical music.|$|E
25|$|Schachter-Shalomi {{encouraged}} {{diversity among}} his students and {{urged them to}} bring their own talents, vision, views and social justice values to the study and practice of Judaism. Based on the Hasidic writings of Rabbi Mordechai Yosef Leiner of Izbitz, he taught that anything, <b>even</b> <b>what</b> others consider sin and heresy could be God's will. His detractors argued that his views were too unconventional and that the theology he promulgated borders on pantheism. His supporters argued that his empowering approach was legitimate, and praised the range of Jewish ritual art, music and liturgical innovation that his work seeded.|$|E
25|$|<b>Even</b> <b>what</b> we hear must be {{attached}} to a visual image. To help recall something we have heard rather than seen, we should attach to their words the appearance, facial expression, and gestures of the person speaking {{as well as the}} appearance of the room. The speaker should therefore create strong visual images, through expression and gesture, which will fix the impression of his words. All the rhetorical textbooks contain detailed advice on declamatory gesture and expression; this underscores the insistence of Aristotle, Avicenna, and other philosophers, on the primacy and security for memory of the visual over all other sensory modes, auditory, tactile, and the rest.|$|E

25|$|The war devastated {{not only}} soldiers. By {{the end of}} 1915, there were {{manifold}} signs that the economy was breaking down under the heightened strain of wartime demand. The main problems were food shortages and rising prices. Inflation dragged incomes down at an alarmingly rapid rate, and shortages {{made it difficult to}} buy <b>even</b> <b>what</b> one could afford. These shortages were a problem especially in the capital, St. Petersburg, where distance from supplies and poor transportation networks made matters particularly bad. Shops closed early or entirely for lack of bread, sugar, meat and other provisions, and lines lengthened massively for what remained. It became increasingly difficult both to afford and actually buy food.|$|E
25|$|I'm {{just happy}} to be here. I think being a young artist, just {{starting}} out of high school, what kids listen to is club music.

25|$|The new English {{language}} venture faced considerable {{regulatory and}} commercial hurdles in the North America market for its perceived sympathy with extremist causes. At the same time, others felt Al Jazeera's competitive advantage lay in programming in the Arabic language. There {{were hundreds of}} millions of potential viewers among the non-Arabic language speaking Muslims in Europe and Asia, however, and many others who might be interested in seeing news from the Middle East read by local voices. If the venture panned out, it would extend the influence of Al Jazeera, and tiny Qatar, beyond <b>even</b> <b>what</b> had been achieved in the station's first decade. In an interesting twist of fate, the BBC World Service was preparing to launch its own Arabic language station in 2007.|$|E

25|$|Astrobiology is an {{interdisciplinary}} field {{that uses a}} combination of geobiological and planetary science data to establish a context for the search for life on other planets. The origin of life from non-living chemistry and geology, or abiogenesis, is a major topic in astrobiology. Even though it is fundamentally an earth-bound concern, and therefore of great geobiological interest, getting at {{the origin of life}} necessitates considering what life requires, what, if anything, is special about Earth, what might have changed to allow life to blossom, what constitutes evidence for life, and <b>even</b> <b>what</b> constitutes life itself. These are the same questions that scientists might ask when searching for alien life. In addition, astrobiologists research the possibility of life based on other metabolisms and elements, the survivability of Earth’s organisms on other planets or spacecrafts, planetary and solar system evolution, and space geochemistry.|$|E
25|$|The provincial {{government}} and police were criticised by the locals for having allowed the attack to take place, especially since police roadblocks {{on the way}} to Beslan were removed shortly before the attack. Many blamed rampant corruption that allowed the attackers to bribe their way through the checkpoints; in fact, this was <b>even</b> <b>what</b> they had openly boasted to their hostages. Others say the militants took the back roads used by smugglers in collusion with the police. Yulia Latynina alleged that Major Gurazhev was captured after he approached the militants' truck to demand a bribe for what he thought was an oil-smuggling operation. It was also alleged the federal police knew of the time and place of the planned attack; according to internal police documents obtained by Novaya Gazeta, the Moscow MVD knew about the hostage taking four hours in advance, having learned this from a militant captured in Chechnya. According to Basayev, the road to Beslan was cleared of roadblocks because the FSB planned to ambush the group later, believing the rebels' aim was to seize the parliament of North Ossetia in Vladikavkaz.|$|E
25|$|Dr Oliver, I was told, … had a liking and a ′flair′ for the {{invention}} of simple appliances, with which observations and experiments could {{be made on the}} human subject. Dr Oliver had invented a small instrument with which he claimed to be able to measure, through the unbroken skin, the diameter of a living artery, such as the radial artery at the wrist. He appears to have used his family in his experiments, and a young son {{was the subject of a}} series, in which Dr Oliver measured the diameter of the radial artery, and observed the effect upon it of injecting extracts of various animal glands under the skin. … We may picture, then, Professor Schafer, in the old physiological laboratory at University College, … finishing an experiment of some kind, in which he was recording the arterial blood pressure of an anaesthetised dog. … To him enters Dr Oliver, with the story of the experiments on his boy, and, in particular, with the statement that injection under the skin of a glycerin extract from calf’s suprarenal gland was followed by a definite narrowing of the radial artery. Professor Schafer is said to have been entirely sceptical, and to have attributed the observation to self-delusion. … He can hardly be blamed, I think; knowing <b>even</b> <b>what</b> we now know about the action of this extract, which of us would be prepared to believe that injecting it under a boy’s skin would cause his radial artery to become measurably more slender? Dr Oliver, however, is persistent; he … suggests that, at least, it will do no harm to inject into the circulation, through a vein, a little of the suprarenal extract, which he produces from his pocket. So Professor Schafer makes the injection, expecting a triumphant demonstration of nothing, and finds himself standing ′like some watcher of the skies, when a new planet swims into his ken,′ watching the mercury rise in the manometer with amazing rapidity and to an astounding height.|$|E

Both his and Joe Cocker's version will suffice nicely until Ray Charles gets around to it." [...] Writing in Saturday Review magazine, Ellen Sander described [...] "Something" [...] as [...] "certainly {{one of the most beautiful}} songs George Harrison has ever written" [...] and added: [...] "He feels his way through the song, instinctively cutting through its body and into the core, emoting so clearly and so gracefully that at the moment he peals 'I don't know, I don't know,' it is shown that <b>even</b> <b>what</b> is not known can be understood." [...] In his review of the single, Derek Johnson of the NME lauded the track as [...] "a real quality hunk of pop" [...] with a [...] "strident lead guitar which exudes a mean and moody quality". Johnson stated his regret that Harrison [...] "isn't featured more regularly as a singer", and concluded of [...] "Something": [...] "It's a song that grows on you, and mark my words, it will – in a big way!" ...|$|E
