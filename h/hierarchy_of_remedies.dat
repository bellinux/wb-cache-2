25|$|Grisi siknis is {{generally}} only cured by traditional Miskito healing methods, according to The Journal of the American Botanical Council. In treating the ailment, the Miskito typically follow a <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> <b>remedies,</b> turning first to home-based remedies, second to modern health facilities {{and finally to}} curandero or witch doctors, the latter particularly, if evil spirits {{are believed to be}} involved. These healers use an assortment of vapor baths, anointing, teas and potions, all of which are organically derived. According to Dennis, the Miskito healers use a variety of undisclosed steamed herbal remedies that are generally more successful than any Western medicine. However, the cures can be counteracted, Dennis says, by exposure to dead people, pregnant women and various meats.|$|E
40|$|A couple buys a couch. After delivery, {{they notice}} that {{the legs of the}} couch are not rectangular, like they ordered, but circular. After some angry calls and letters they {{introduce}} an action before the court to terminate the contract in order to get their money back. Against all expectations, the Belgian court of appeal of Ghent decides completely against the couple. According to the court, the couple disregarded the consumer sales rules in the Civil Code, implementing the EU Consumer Sales Directive. They did not respect the strict <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> <b>remedies</b> which favors repair or replacement over termination and price reduction: the buyers should have sued for repair or replacement instead of trying to terminate the contract. Moreover, they transgressed the notification rules: they should have notified the seller about the shortcoming, before invoking a remedy. This case and many others, show that confusion reigns {{in the area of the}} organization of consumer sales remedies. The strict <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> <b>remedies</b> imposed by the EU Consumer Sales Directive might be insufficiently protective for consumers. Moreover, after withdrawing the CESL -proposal, the EU Commission issued new projects, treating, among others, the contractual remedies in the e-commerce sector. Also in the US there is an on-going debate about the organization of remedies in contract law and the UCC. Over the last decades, many publications appeared about the irreparable injury-rule and adequacy-rule favoring damages over specific performance. It has drawn the attention of law & economics specialists, legal philosophers, and more recently the behaviorists have expressed their interest in the topic. At the same moment, academics are working on a restatement of US consumer contract law. The organization of remedies is a vivid topic, both in the US and EU. Nevertheless, a thorough cross-examination of the EU consumer sales law system (mainly based on the civil law tradition) and the US common law system is not sufficiently present in the current debate. Therefore, this paper will address this on the basis of in-depth comparative research. The paper firstly assesses the so-called 'hierarchy' of remedies that is prescribed by law. Another aspect that has an important impact on the aforementioned <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> <b>remedies</b> are the different notification duties and their limitation periods. The last element that will be assessed and which greatly influences the <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> <b>remedies</b> is the ability (or not) to invoke remedies extrajudicially. The main question is: what is the best possible organization of remedies to move forward to protect consumers? Answer to this question will be based on the principles of coherence of the legal system, legal certainty and the level of consumer protection. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} nature and {{economic}} effects of the contractual remedies and their role and specifics of application in the contemporary international trade, demonstrated on the example of standard construction contracts. Various remedies are examined within several legal orders across Civil and Common law traditions from the position of their convergence and utilization in the international contracting. Main focus of the research is on the economic efficiency of the contractual remedies as elements of integrated system, flexible and adjustable due to changes (internal and external to the parties’) in the circumstances after conclusion of the contract. Purpose {{of the study is}} to analyze possibilities for further harmonization of the contractual remedies’ regulation and adoption of their more efficient forms, developed within different jurisdictions and soft law codifications. These improved forms, as discussed in the work, are capable of enhancing economic efficiency of individual remedies and their productive incorporation in a cohesive remedial system, enabling contractual parties to divide various interests inside one contract and vary levels of their respective protection, exploiting suitable function of each remedy. First part is dedicated to studying definition of remedy, its functions and approach to it, developed within various contractual theories; it also briefly examines general differences between Common and Civil law systems, explaining dissimilarities in formation of remedies in various legal orders. In the second part I analyze specifics of each remedy in respective jurisdictions, including analysis of local statutory and case law, considering laws of France, Germany, UK, USA, and Finland and international codifications, underlying economic effects and drawbacks of every remedy. Remedies in question are: specific performance; damages’ compensation; termination of contract; liquidated damages and penalty; price reduction and performance withholding. Third chapter is devoted to history of development of the construction contract, combining elements of sale and service; application of each remedy in the standard construction contracts in their dynamic system and methods of improving economic efficiency. The research concludes that each remedy may simultaneously have various functions (preventive, restorative and corrective) regardless of compensatory or non-compensatory criterion, which currently becomes irrelevant. Remedial system adopted in the contract should be flexible and easy adjustable to the changes in the post-contractual circumstances. Following the ongoing process of normative convergence various legal orders should be harmonized; they should recognize autonomy of the parties to create own enforceable <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> <b>remedies</b> within the contract and should ensure judicial intervention solely from the angle of safeguarding just and fair outcome. Study further determines that measures of enhancing economic efficiency of each remedy have been already developed in the practice and only need recognition and change of attitude in the respective national systems, widening perspectives of interpretation and qualification...|$|E
