5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) announces to {{the staff}} of The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) that she is {{participating}} in a charity which provides gifts to underprivileged children who write letters to Santa. She buys far more than what is requested in the letter, wanting to see the children's happiness. When Liz delivers the presents to the apartment in the letter, however, the door is answered by two adults who take the gifts, and she believes she has been tricked. Receiving no help from the US Postal Service, who run the charity, she attempts to have <b>it</b> <b>shut</b> down. This upsets Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) who refuses to believe anyone would scam a Christmas charity. She takes Kenneth back to the apartment to prove she was right, but two children answer the door and Liz accidentally reveals to them that Santa Claus is not real.|$|E
5|$|Tidal action {{along the}} coast {{affected}} the balance of salinity in coastal marshes and water bodies. The sudden intrusion of saltwater stressed delicate plants. Fish, shrimp and oysters also suffered the ecological effects of Hurricane Carmen. Flooding on land caused some wildlife to drown. Several parks in Louisiana sustained damage, either from flooding or high winds; losses to Grand Island State Park in particular totaled $114,600. The {{oil and gas industry}} was also affected, and its estimated $24.7million in losses resulted mainly from damage to equipment and offshore facilities. The storm diminished oil production by 1.4 million barrels when <b>it</b> <b>shut</b> down operations for 24 to 48 hours at various locations. Over 60,000 electric cooperative customers lost power.|$|E

5|$|The tunnel also suffers regular {{problems}} with strikes from over-height traffic, and vehicles {{running out of}} fuel. On 10 December 1996, a man drove a Mercedes truck supporting a crane towards the southbound tunnel, ignored warnings that his vehicle was over-height, and struck a gantry, breaking a steel reinforcement frame in the process. The entire tunnel was immediately closed, not only to retrieve the vehicle, but to perform additional safety checks. Because the Limehouse Link tunnel, which runs near to {{the north end of}} the Blackwall Tunnel, and the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge, part of the Dartford Crossing, were also closed on the same day, the accident caused one of the worst traffic jams in the capital. In February 2011, TfL reported that the tunnel had been closed 1,200 times in the previous year for a total of 157 hours, while New Civil Engineer magazine claimed <b>it</b> <b>shut</b> 1,448 times in 2010. To try to prevent closures of this nature, an LED noticeboard was set up in the northbound approach, counting the number of breakdowns and accidents per month occurring inside the tunnel.|$|E

25|$|Cornwall Iron Furnace became {{obsolete}} by the 1880s.

Cornwall Furnace no longer earned a profit in its last ten years of operation and the last owner, Robert Habersham Coleman, had <b>it</b> <b>shut</b> down on February 11, 1883.

25|$|The Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, {{also known}} as the Taftâ€“Hartley Act, in 1947 revised the Wagner Act to include {{restrictions}} on unions as well as management.

The Act was bitterly fought by unions, vetoed by President Harry S. Truman, and passed over his veto. Repeated union efforts to repeal or modify it always failed, and it remains in effect today.|$|E
