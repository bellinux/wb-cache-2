40|$|This {{study is}} {{premised on the}} {{assumption}} that <b>foregrounding</b> is the dominant feature of poetry. Such an assumption informs this study {{to the extent that it}} examines the role of <b>foregrounding</b> in isiXhosa modem poetry. <b>Foregrounding,</b> as an unusual or deviant usage of language, manifests itself as: metaphorical language, <b>foregrounded</b> sound, syntactic <b>foregrounding</b> and the variation of rhythmico-metrical structure. These are called <b>foregrounding</b> techniques. However, this study deals only with the first three <b>foregrounding</b> techniques. Qangule's poetry furnishes this study with examples that are used to illustrate that <b>foregrounding</b> plays a significant role in isiXhosa modem poetry. The <b>foregrounding</b> techniques depict, illustrate, dramatize and suggest the meaning of a poem. They also have the ability to do that in a collaborative manner.

40|$|AbstractForegrounding {{is one of}} {{the ways}} in poetry to {{influence}} the meaning patterns. Those linguistic categories <b>foregrounded</b> by poets may occur different linguistic levels such as phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics. <b>Foregrounding</b> is defined as follows: “(Foregrounding) is realized {{through the use of a}} linguistic unit in a position other than its conventional position in a sentence or in narration. The other way to realize <b>foregrounding</b> is achieved through emphasizing a particular linguistic unit. The process of emphasizing is again created through the use of any grammatical unit in a non-conventional position” (Özünlü, 2001, p. 74). Therefore, the analysis of <b>foregrounded</b> units provides us with a significant insight about the meaning patterns of poems. Furthermore, <b>foregrounding</b> may lead to repetitions and deviations in the language of poems. The most frequent examples for rhetoric are <b>foregrounding</b> and analogy. This study deals with the analysis of <b>foregrounding</b> in poems that include the examples from Classical Turkish Poetry (Divan Poetry) as well as from Modern Turkish Poetry...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} comprehension of anaphoric pronouns in reading. Chapter, I explains {{the importance of}} this feature of text processing, and reviews the relevant psychological literature. One -important feature of pronoun interpretation is the fact that antecedents vary in accessibility in response to aspects of text content and structure; antecedents which are readily acessible to pronominal reference are said to be <b>foregrounded.</b> The most common theoretical explanation of <b>foregrounding</b> is the claim that <b>foregrounded</b> antecedents are held in working memory. The review also shows reasons why good and poor readers might differ in sensitivity to <b>foregrounding.</b> Experiments 1 - 3 investigated the effects on <b>foregrounding</b> of pronoun-antecedent distance and of topical continuity. It was found that distance had no effect on ease of pronoun assignment provided the intervening sentences were closely related to the antecedent. When the intervening sentences dealt with unrelated topics, pronoun interpretation became more difficult. The working memory explanation of <b>foregrounding</b> was investigated in Experiments 4 - 5, which found no evidence that <b>foregrounding</b> of an antecedent facilitated recognition memory for that antecedent. None of Experiments 1 - 5 found differences between the pronoun interpretation processes of good and poor readers. There then follows a critical discussion of the working memory theory, which argues that <b>foregrounding</b> may also be explicable by a theory stressing antecedent retrieval processes. Later experiments attempted to discriminate between these theories. Experiments 6 - 7 found that antecedent <b>foregrounding</b> was sensitive to the content of the pronoun sentence itself. Experiments 8 - 9 found that <b>foregrounding</b> of an incorrect antecedent did not hamper pronoun interpretation any more than neutral backgrounding. All the results of Experiments 4 - 9 contradict the working memory theory. It is concluded that the working memory theory of <b>foregrounding</b> is inadequate to explain the present results, and that an account of <b>foregrounding</b> based on antecedent retrieval processes is a plausible alternative.

5|$|Any time deep {{focus was}} impossible—as {{in the scene}} in which Kane {{finishes}} a negative review of Susan's opera {{while at the same}} time firing the person who began writing the review—an optical printer was used to make the whole screen appear in focus, visually layering one piece of film onto another. However, some apparently deep-focus shots were the result of in-camera effects, as in the famous scene in which Kane breaks into Susan's room after her suicide attempt. In the background, Kane and another man break into the room, while simultaneously the medicine bottle and a glass with a spoon in it are in closeup in the <b>foreground.</b> The shot was an in-camera matte shot. The <b>foreground</b> was shot first, with the background dark. Then the background was lit, the <b>foreground</b> darkened, the film rewound, and the scene re-shot with the background action.|$|E
5|$|Depth and {{dimension}} are rendered {{by the use}} {{of linear}} perspective, by the overlapping of the layers of shapes, and in particular, as stated by Clark, through the use of tone. This compositional element operates within the picture in a number of ways. First, there is the appearance of natural light within the painted room and beyond it. The pictorial space in the midground and <b>foreground</b> is lit from two sources: by thin shafts of light from the open door, and by broad streams coming through the window to the right. The 20th-century French philosopher and cultural critic Michel Foucault observed that the light from the window illuminates both the studio <b>foreground</b> and the unrepresented area in front of it, in which the king, the queen, and the viewer are presumed to be situated. For José Ortega y Gasset, light divides the scene into three distinct parts, with <b>foreground</b> and background planes strongly illuminated, between which a darkened intermediate space includes silhouetted figures.|$|E

To implement parallax scrolling without having to manage all of the elements moving past each other, {{he came up with}} a plan to instead save combinations of overlapping <b>foreground</b> and background elements in memory and display the appropriate combination for where Keen was on the screen, so that the game only needed to pick the correct image rather than recalculate what that image would be.|$|E

40|$|Structuring of {{information}} proceeds through the <b>foregrounding</b> of {{certain parts of}} the information. In general, <b>foregrounding</b> can be realized on various linguistic levels and it is possible to distinguish: Conceptual, Functional, Discourse and Pragmatic devices, which can be represented by various formal means: Phonetic-Phonological, Morphological-Syntactic and Lexical-Pragmatic. All the devices can co-occur during the information packaging. Some of them are obligatory and are on the high level of the hierarchically organized processes of <b>foregrounding</b> (e. g. conceptual or functional foregrounding); some of them are optional and they are defined by the specific discourse and/or pragmatic values of a sentence (e. g. focus or topic); some forms of <b>foregrounding</b> are implicational (e. g. sometimes reordering implies emphasis of intonation) and so on. The relations between the different kinds of <b>foregrounding</b> are language specific, but it seems possible to speak about universal models of formalization of the information structures.

50|$|The {{process of}} <b>foregrounding,</b> or making salient, depends on contrast: {{an aspect of}} the text’s language, or a set of textual features, can only be <b>foregrounded</b> against a {{patterning}} which becomes the ‘background’.

40|$|In {{this article}} I suggest that <b>foregrounding</b> theory, arguably the {{cornerstone}} of stylistics, might be employed {{not only in the}} analysis of texts, but also as a methodology in teaching stylistic analysis.

In order to demonstrate how this might work I draw upon my own experiences of lecturing on a first year undergraduate course in stylistics (LING 131 Language and Style). I discuss the reasoning behind the teaching methods used on the course as a means of showing how <b>foregrounding</b> elements of a lecture might result in a more effective learning experience for students. I also explain how the effectiveness of LING 131 is due to its unique presentation of <b>foregrounding</b> via <b>foregrounding...</b>|$|R
40|$|Style is an {{important}} aspect of literature, and stylistic deviations are sometimes labeled <b>foregrounded,</b> since their manner of expression deviates from the stylistic default. Russian Formalists have claimed that <b>foregrounding</b> increases processing demands and therefore causes slower reading – an effect called retardation. We tested this claim experimentally by having participants read short literary stories while measuring their eye movements. Our results confirm that readers indeed read slower and make more regressions towards <b>foregrounded</b> passages as compared to passages that are not <b>foregrounded.</b> A closer look, however, reveals significant individual differences in sensitivity to <b>foregrounding.</b> Some readers in fact do not slow down at all when reading <b>foregrounded</b> passages. The slowing down effect for literariness was related to a slowing down effect for high perplexity (unexpected) words: those readers who slowed down more during literary passages also slowed down more during high perplexity words, even though no correlation between literariness and perplexity existed in the stories. We conclude that individual differences {{play a major role in}} processing of literary texts and argue for accounts of literary reading that focus on the interplay between reader and tex...|$|R
