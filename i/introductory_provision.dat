2500|$|<b>Introductory</b> <b>provisions</b> of the {{document}} (Chapter I) contain the fundamental principles of the State, placing high value on democracy, but also asserting the collective and individual right of defence against attempts by force to encroach upon [...] "independence, territorial integrity, or constitutional order of the State". The provisions also disallow division of Lithuanian territory into any [...] "state derivatives"—a reference to territorial autonomy {{as a solution to}} ethnic minority problems in the country. Article 150 of the constitution incorporates a constitutional act [...] "On the Non-Alignment of the Republic of Lithuania with Post-Soviet Eastern Alliances", effectively prohibiting the membership in the Commonwealth of Independent States and similar structures.|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} how {{the jurisdiction of}} administrative courts has been shaped by legislative acts that introduced a system of two-instance administrative courts. Administrative courts exercise judicial power just like the Supreme Court, courts of general jurisdiction and courts martial (article 175 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland). The range of administrative courts’ jurisdiction {{and the nature of}} their judicial power are clearly formulated in article 184 of the Constitution. According to the article, administrative courts exercise control over civil service within a scope limited by statutes. The control involves passing judgments on the compliance of local government’s resolutions with statutes. Setting clear limits of administrative courts’ material jurisdiction by the Constitution had a decisive impact on the way and scope of regulating this jurisdiction by statutes that introduced reform of administrative courts: the Administrative Courts Structure Act, 25 th July 2002, the Proceedings Before Administrative Courts Act, 30 th August 2002, and <b>Introductory</b> <b>Provisions</b> to: Administrative Courts Structure Act and the Proceedings Before Administrative Courts Act...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{protection}} of rights understood as sets of claims, freedom and authority, takes place on two levels, usually called "substantial", which identifies the various positions attributed to subjects of law and "procedural", which provides forms and tools to react against the injury of such positions before a judge and ask for the protection. A right is protected establishing its recognition or attribution in the law and so being able to access to justice. The problem of {{protection of rights}} is conditioned by the choices that the legislator operates on the levels mentioned above. This research work investigates if there are {{cases in which the}} judge may refrain from pronouncing judgment, or if such cases cannot be admitted. In order to answer this question it is possible to start from the analysis of the relationship between prohibition of non liquet, on the one hand, and the effects that this prohibition produces on the legal protection of rights, on the other. The prohibition of non liquet is historically considered as a logical consequence of the completeness of the legal system and, in this context, is seen as a tool of powerful guarantee against arbitrariness of judges and rights uncertainty. In the contemporary context, the picture appears to be significantly changed. Not only for the progressive awareness about the impossibility of a complete law system ab origine, but also for the metamorphosis of prohibition of non liquet in this context. If there isn't any specific law concerning a legal question, it's necessary to investigate Legal System to find a solution to the matter. The Italian Legal System has a not flexible Constitution, where art. 24, 1 ° comma, together with art. 12 of the <b>introductory</b> <b>provisions</b> to the Italian Civil Code of 1942, do not allow the Court to refuse from deciding on a matter because of the silence or the obscurity of the law. As a result of an examination of some sensitive cases, recently occurred, the judges enhance as much as possible the access to justice {{even in the absence of}} a specific provision about a legal matter. The conclusion of the analysis highlights how the aim of prohibition of non liquet is different from the past. Born in a context where the utmost confidence was placed in the legislator and in the completeness of the Code, the prohibition of non liquet ensures the protection of rights when Codes don't give a specific provision. Thanks to this important evolution of prohibition of non liquet, nowadays it is possible both ask for a right to be protected and obtain an answer from a judge, also in absence of a specific provision. Certainty of Law depends on the work of judges and it means not only to be able to know in advance the consequences of a certain behavior, but also to be able to obtain legal protection for rights...|$|R
