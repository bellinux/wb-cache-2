50|$|The terms <b>hot</b> <b>plug</b> {{and cold}} plug {{can be taken}} to mean two {{different}} things, depending on the context. In a more generic context, <b>hot</b> <b>plug</b> is the ability to add or remove hardware without powering down the system, while cold plug is the inability to do so. In the context of comparing certain hot-pluggable devices, however, <b>hot</b> <b>plug</b> {{can be taken to}} mean the ability of the system to autonomously detect the addition or removal of hardware as it occurs, while cold plug can be taken to mean the ability to add or remove devices without powering down or rebooting the system, but the inability of the system to detect these changes, in which case the system operator would have to tell the system software that the change has occurred.|$|R
5000|$|A {{glow plug}} engine must be {{operated}} {{with the correct}} glow plug temperature. Large engines can operate with lower temperatures, while smaller engines radiate heat to the air more quickly and require a <b>hotter</b> glow <b>plug</b> to maintain the correct temperature for ignition. The ambient temperature also dictates the best glow plug temperature; in cold weather, <b>hotter</b> <b>plugs</b> are needed. Since glow plug engines are air-cooled, an engine that [...] "runs hot" [...] can sometimes benefit from a lower plug temperature, although this may cause rougher idling and difficulty in tuning. The operating speed of the engine must also be considered; if the engine is to run at consistently high RPM, such as with an airplane or a car on a mostly straight track, a lower plug temperature is more efficient. If the engine is to operate at lower RPM, combustion will not heat the engine as much, and a <b>hotter</b> <b>plug</b> is required.|$|R

50|$|Hot {{swapping}} and <b>hot</b> <b>plugging</b> is replacing or adding components {{without stopping}} or {{shutting down the}} system. More specifically, hot swapping describes replacing components without interruption to the system, while <b>hot</b> <b>plugging</b> describes the addition of components that would expand the system without significant interruption to {{the operation of the}} system. Once the appropriate software is installed on the computer, a user can plug and unplug the component without rebooting. A well-known example of this functionality is the Universal Serial Bus (USB) that allows users to add or remove peripheral components such as a mouse, keyboard, or printer.|$|E
5000|$|As no {{commercial}} {{devices were}} released supporting ZIPI, the sufficiency of MIDI for most applications {{and the introduction}} of the [...] "FireWire" [...] (IEEE1394) as the alternative physical layer soon led to the practical demise of the project. ZIPI web site at CNMAT asserts that IEEE1394 [...] "supersedes ZIPI in every respect," [...] mainly because it has simpler interface requirements: it does not require a hub, supports <b>hot</b> <b>plugging</b> (devices may be added or removed more conveniently), and includes an isolated power distribution scheme.|$|E

5000|$|It {{soon became}} clear that the PCMCIA card {{standard}} needed expansion to support [...] "smart" [...] I/O cards to address the emerging need for fax, modem, LAN, harddisk and floppy disk cards. It also needed interrupt facilities and <b>hot</b> <b>plugging,</b> which required the definition of new BIOS and operating system interfaces. This led to the introduction of release 2.0 of the PCMCIA standard and JEIDA 4.1 in September 1991, which saw corrections and expansion with Card Services (CS) in the PCMCIA 2.1 standard in November 1992.|$|E
50|$|A.b was {{an attempt}} to {{reproduce}} these qualities in a new standard for the PC and workstation market. It had two additional advantages over ADB; <b>hot</b> <b>plugging</b> (plug-n-play) and the ability for the devices to have their own host controllers so devices could be plugged together without the need for a host computer to control the communications. Philips also suggested that the ability to plug any A.b device into any computer meant that people with special devices, like mice designed for people with disabilities, might carry their device from machine to machine.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{slightly}} differing {{meanings of}} the term hot swapping. It may refer only {{to the ability to}} add or remove hardware without powering down the system, while the system software may have to be notified by the user of the event in order to cope with it. Examples include RS-232 and lower-end SCSI devices. This is sometimes called cold plugging. However, if the system can detect and respond to addition or removal of hardware, it is referred to as true <b>hot</b> <b>plugging.</b> Examples include USB, FireWire and higher-end SCSI devices.|$|E

40|$|APPLICATION NOTE Even though ESD {{protection}} {{is not yet}} required by the USB 1. 1 and USB 2. 0 specifications, it is extremely important and necessary that all USB ports have protection against ESD conditions because USB components are subject to electrostatic discharge conditions since USB is a <b>hot</b> <b>plugging</b> and unplugging system.

40|$|The future manycore {{architectures}} present serious {{challenges to}} operating system designers. The traditional operating system designs {{can no longer}} manage the capabilities {{and power of the}} diverse heterogeneous cores with complex memory hierarchies, interconnects resembling networks, and distributed I/O configurations. The Barrelfish multikernel operating system addresses these issues by treating hardware as a distributed system. Co-operation in such an environment is achieved by message passing. We borrow similar design ideas in this thesis and present a distributed USB <b>hot</b> <b>plugging</b> infrastructure for a multikernel Barrelfish operating system. We have divided the USB system into three primary modules with different responsibilities: Host controller driver, USB manager and client drivers. This modular design provides necessary isolation and flexibility required in manycore systems. It also provides freedom to schedule and, if required, migrate any module independently among the cores depending upon the system workload and the application requirements. These modules communicate by explicit message passing but a few frequently updated and performance critical data structures are shared using shared memory mechanism. In this thesis, we try to design, implement and evaluate this system on top of message services and abstractions provided by the Barrelfish operating system...|$|E

40|$|GaN-based {{light-emitting}} diodes have recently demonstrated {{to be almost}} ideal devices for the realization of next generation light sources, thanks to their high performance and long expected lifetime. For a massive market penetration of these devices, their reliability must be significantly improved: if on one hand the physical mechanisms responsible for gradual degradation have been extensively described, {{on the other hand}} the origin of catastrophic failures still has to be investigated in detail. One of the most critical situations occurs when an LED module is directly connected to an energized power supply: this event (usually referred to as "hot-plugging") can generate current spikes up to several tens of amperes, that can potentially destroy or damage the LEDs. The aim of this work is (i) to analyze, for the first time, the nature of the current spikes generated during hot-plugging, (ii) to understand the failure mechanisms of LEDs submitted to high current spikes, and (iii) to present a simplified model to explain the <b>hot</b> <b>plugging</b> phenomenon. The study is based on transient electrical measurements, carried out on several LED modules (fabricated by different manufacturers), connected to three different power supplies. Results reveal that the amplitude and the time constants of the current spikes are directly determined by the number of LEDs connected in series and by the output capacitance of the current driver, and provide information on the gradual or catastrophic failure of LEDs submitted to current spike...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{high-power}} white LEDs {{in general}} lighting applications is becoming, day-by-day, increasingly important. The reliability of these devices, {{compared to that}} of conventional light sources, represents one of the keys for their development and their market penetration. It is then of fundamental importance to deeply understand the various degradation mechanisms that affect the operation of LEDs, in terms of lifetime, chromaticity characteristics and efficiency. This thesis reports the results of a research activity focused on several issues related to the reliability of LED-based lighting systems. After an initial overview on the most important theoretical concepts necessary for the understanding of the physical results, three main sections can be identified in this thesis, concerning the presentation of research activity: •	The first section reports an extensive study {{on one of the most}} critical Electrical Over Stress (EOS) phenomena, called “Hot-plugging”, which occurs when an LED module is directly connected to an energized power supply and can generate current spikes up to several tens of amperes that can potentially destroy or damage the LEDs. The aim of this section is to analyze, for the first time, the nature of the current spikes generated during hot-plugging and to present a simplified model to explain the <b>hot</b> <b>plugging</b> phenomenon. The study is based on transient electrical measurements, carried out on several LED modules (fabricated by different manufacturers), connected to three different power supplies. Results reveal that the amplitude and the time constants of the current spikes are directly determined by the number of LEDs connected in series and by the output capacitance of the current driver. •	Afterwards, the second section presents an extensive study on the effects of Electrostatic Discharges (ESD) on state-of-the-art GaN based LEDs, based on optical and electrical measurements carried out during the ESD events. ESD events were simulated through a Transmission Line Pulser (TLP), which generates voltage pulses with a duration of 100 ns and increasing amplitude: during each pulse, spatially resolved electroluminescence measurements were carried out through a high speed EMCCD camera. These measurements allowed to identify the chip region where the discharge is localized and the change in the damaged area induced by consecutive ESD events. In addition, the current and voltage waveforms at the LED terminal were monitored during the tests; this analysis provided important information about modifications the impedance of the devices. 	The analysis was carried out on different types of commercially available low-power GaN-based LEDs with several differences in the manufacturing technology. Thanks to these tests, we have identified two different failure behaviors during a destructive ESD event, clearly related to the different defects in the semiconductor lattice and to structure of the chip. •	The last section investigates the thermal stability of remote phosphor plates to be used in solid-state lighting systems, for the conversion of the blue light emitted by GaN-based LEDs into white light. A preliminary thermal characterization revealed that in normal conditions of blue light irradiance the phosphor plates could reach temperature levels higher than 60 °C, which can affect both performance and reliability. The results of accelerated thermal stress tests indicate that high temperature levels can trigger a relevant degradation mechanism (estimated activation energy is 1. 2 eV), that drastically reduces the phosphor conversion efficiency and modifies the photometric and colorimetric characteristics of the emitted white light. ...|$|E

50|$|Serial ATA (SATA, {{abbreviated}} from Serial AT Attachment) is {{a computer}} bus interface that connects host bus adapters to mass storage devices such as hard disk drives, optical drives, and solid-state drives. Serial ATA succeeded the older Parallel ATA (PATA) standard, offering several advantages over the older interface: reduced cable size and cost (seven conductors instead of 40 or 80), native hot swapping, faster data transfer through higher signaling rates, and more efficient transfer through an (optional) I/O queuing protocol.

Whether a spark plug is [...] "hot" [...] or [...] "cold" [...] is known as the heat range of the spark plug.

50|$|It {{was common}} before {{the modern era}} of {{computerized}} fuel injection to specify {{at least a couple}} of different heat ranges for plugs for an automobile engine; a <b>hotter</b> <b>plug</b> for cars that were mostly driven slowly around the city, and a colder plug for sustained high-speed highway use. This practice has, however, largely become obsolete now that cars' fuel/air mixtures and cylinder temperatures are maintained within a narrow range, for purposes of limiting emissions. Racing engines, however, still benefit from picking a proper plug heat range. Very old racing engines will sometimes have two sets of plugs, one just for starting and another to be installed for driving once the engine is warmed up.|$|R

The method integrates well with the TTP/A protocol and is implementable in standard TTP/A slave and master nodes.
