5|$|Racism and {{antisemitism}} were basic {{tenets of}} the NSDAP and the Nazi regime. Nazi Germany's racial policy was based on their belief in the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> superior master race. The Nazis postulated the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> racial conflict between the Aryan master race and inferior races, particularly Jews, who were viewed as a mixed race that had infiltrated society and {{were responsible for the}} exploitation and repression of the Aryan race.|$|E

5|$|An {{approach}} to supporting the possibility premise in Plantinga's {{version of the}} argument was attempted by Alexander R. Pruss. He started with the 8th–9th century AD Indian philosopher Sankara's dictum that if something is impossible, we cannot have a perception (even a non-veridical one) {{that it is the}} case. It follows that if we have a perception that p, then even though it might not be the case that p, it is at least the case that possibly p.
