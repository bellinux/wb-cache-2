500|$|Some {{believers in}} a 2012 doomsday {{used the term}} [...] "galactic alignment" [...] to {{describe}} a different phenomenon proposed by some scientists to explain a pattern in mass extinctions supposedly observed in the fossil record. According to the Shiva Hypothesis, mass extinctions are not random, but recur every 26 million years. To account for this, {{it was suggested that}} vertical oscillations made by the Sun on its 250-million-year orbit of the galactic center cause it to regularly pass through the galactic plane. When the Sun's orbit takes it outside the galactic plane which bisects the <b>galactic</b> <b>disc,</b> the influence of the galactic tide is weaker. However, when re-entering the galactic disc—as it does every 20–25million years—it comes {{under the influence of the}} far stronger [...] "disc tides", which, according to mathematical models, increase the flux of Oort cloud comets into the inner Solar System by a factor of 4, thus leading to a massive increase in the likelihood of a devastating comet impact.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that star clusters form with low star formation efficiencies. With the onset of stellar winds by massive stars or finally when the first super nova blows off, the residual gas is driven out of the embedded star cluster.

In this context, Kroupa (2002) suggested a new mechanism {{for the emergence of}} thickened <b>Galactic</b> <b>discs.</b> Massive star clusters add kinematically hot components to the galactic field populations, building up in this way, the <b>Galactic</b> thick <b>disc</b> as well.

We find: (i) at z = 0, there is an almost perfect alignment at a median angle of 18 °, in the inner dark matter halo regions where the discs reside, between the spin vector of the gaseous and stellar <b>galactic</b> <b>discs</b> and that of their inner host haloes. The alignment between galaxy spin and spin of the entire host halo is however significantly weaker, ranging from a median of ~ 46 ° at z = 1 to ~ 50 ° at z = 0. (ii) The most massive galaxy discs have spins preferentially aligned so as to point along their host filaments. (iii) The spin of discs in lower mass haloes shows, at redshifts above z ~ 0. 5 and in regions of low environmental density, a clear signature of alignment with the intermediate principal axis of the large-scale tidal field. This behaviour is consistent with predictions of linear tidal torque theory. This alignment decreases with increasing environmental density, and vanishes in the highest density regions. Non-linear effects in the high-density environments are plausibly responsible for establishing this density-alignment correlation.

40|$|Star {{formation}} {{is one of}} the most important subjects in all of astrophysics. Previous analyses have shown that there is a link between star formation and gravitational instabilities in <b>galactic</b> <b>discs.</b> In this thesis we investigate the gravitational instability of 9 dwarf and 12 spiral galaxies from The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS), previously analyzed by Leroy et al. (2008), using the Romeo-Falstad (2013) Q stability parameter for multicomponent and realistically thick <b>galactic</b> <b>discs.</b> Our analysis allows us: (1) to quantify how the stability properties of the dwarfs differ from those of the spirals, (2) to determine how the disc stability properties vary with galactocentric distance, and (3) to establish which component dominates the gravitational instability of the disc. We find that the dominant component differs significantly between the two subsamples in a statistical sense. Even so, the median value of the Q stability parameter is nearly independent of galactocentric distance with a value of order unity for both the dwarfs and the spirals, suggesting that <b>galactic</b> <b>discs</b> may be controlled by self-regulation processes. Two important quantities that enter our stability analysis are the stellar and gaseous velocity dispersions, which we find to have a strong impact on disc instability. In all current stability analyses such quantities are estimated through simple models (e. g. Leroy et al. 2008) since they are difficult to measure. However, our analysis illustrates that using observed stellar and gaseous velocity dispersions would be very useful for understanding the complex link between star formation and gravitational instabilities in disc galaxies...|$|R
40|$|Received date; {{accepted}} date We {{present the}} rst {{results of a}} systematic analysis of radially truncated exponential discs for four galaxies of a sample of disc-dominated edge-on spiral galaxies. Edge-on galaxies are very useful {{for the study of}} truncated <b>galactic</b> <b>discs,</b> since we can follow their light distributions out to larger radii than in less highly inclined galaxies. The origin of these truncations and their asymmetry and sharpness are helpful to better constrain theories of galaxy formation. In general, the discs of our sample galaxies are truncated at similar radii on either side of their centres. With the exception of the disc of ESO 416 -G 25, it appears that our sample galaxies are closely symmetric, in terms of both the sharpness of their disc truncations and the truncation length. However, the truncations occur over a larger region and not as abruptly as found by van der Kruit & Searle (KS 1 { 4). We show that the truncated luminosity distributions of our sample galaxies, if also present in the mass distributions, comfortably meet the requirements for longevity. Stability requirements for <b>galactic</b> <b>discs</b> may {{play an important role in}} the formation and maintenance of disc truncations. A scenario in which <b>galactic</b> <b>discs</b> are truncated at the radii where the gas density becomes subcritical for star formation to occur, combined with slowly growing discs, is possibly what we observe in our sample galaxies. This hypothesis is supported by the radial (B − I) colour proles, showing that, on average, the disc colour tends to get bluer in the truncation region compared to the colours in the exponential disc...|$|R
