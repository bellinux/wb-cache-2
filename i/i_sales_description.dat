500|$|The Act {{extends the}} reach of implied {{conditions}} first {{laid out in the}} Sale of Goods Act 1893. Section 1 replaced Section 12 of the 1893 Act, containing 3 types of implied undertakings to title; a condition that the seller has the right to sell, or will when the property has passed to him, a warranty that the goods have no additional costs that the buyer has not been informed of, and a warranty of quiet possession. These provisions cannot be excluded, although if there is, in the original contract, a provision that the seller can only transfer what title he has, there is no condition that the seller has the right to sell. The Act also regulated <b>sale</b> by <b>description,</b> where products are sold based on a description given of them. Section 2 provides that [...] "a sale of goods shall not be prevented from being a <b>sale</b> by <b>description</b> by reason only that, being exposed for sale or hire, they are selected by the buyer". This is to ensure that a sale in a self-service store is considered <b>sale</b> by <b>description,</b> and that the sale is therefore covered by other provisions.|$|R

Concerning performance: (<b>i)</b> <b>sales</b> and inventory turnover initially drop by 7 % and recover in 6 - 12 months; (ii) inventory turnover recovers more quickly for establishments adopting ERP later; and (iii) broader training produces faster sales recovery. Concerning employee outcomes, initially work intensifies, but in time employee outcomes improve. An implication for practitioners is that ERP success is best evaluated only when sufficient time has elapsed after implementation.

BMC insisted that the way company overheads were shared out, the Mini always made money. Larger profits came from the popular De Luxe models and from optional extras such as seat belts, door mirrors, a heater and a radio, which would be considered necessities on modern cars, as well as the various Cooper and Cooper S models.|$|R
