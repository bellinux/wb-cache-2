5|$|Black Sabbath {{was made}} {{at the end of}} {{production}} of The Girl Who Knew Too Much during an eight-week period between February and March 1963. American International Production's involvement with the film allowed Salvatore Billitteri of the Titra Sound Corporation to be on set to supervise the film for dubbing on its English-language release. As the film was going to be dubbed in different languages, actors could no longer phonetically pronounce their dialogue as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> rhythmically to match various languages. Billitteri was also on set to give suggestions to Bava on how to make his film more appropriate for American audiences which led to decreasing the amount of violence in the film. The film was first conceived under the title The Fear.|$|E
25|$|Social {{problems}} on annexed territory were {{discussed in the}} cabinet meeting on December 22, 1939. The interior minister, Ferenc Keresztes-Fischer, {{who was responsible for}} questions of common goods, health service and social policy, proposed a solution based on unification. The Minister for Upper Country, Andor Jaross, disagreed with this solution and proposed providing the Czechoslovak welfare system for those in the annexed areas for a transitional period, but had no objections to decreasing it to the Hungarian level. The cabinet finally agreed on a compromise. The elimination of Czechoslovak laws from annexed territory was understood as a duty, but <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> step by step. The first step was to decrease the value of a retirement pension from its Czechoslovak value (150 pengő) to its Hungarian value (60 pengő) through a transition value of 120 pengő. Sickness insurance for workers in agriculture was preserved in the form of Czechoslovak regulation for the moment, but it was changed from compulsory to voluntary. In Slovakia, the Czechoslovak system of welfare was preserved after the break-up of Czechoslovakia.|$|E
500|$|Maximilien Aue is {{a former}} officer of the SD, {{security}} and intelligence service of the SS; the book is written {{in the form of}} his memoirs. His mother was French (from Alsace), while his father, who left his mother and disappeared from their life in 1921, was German. Aue's mother remarried a Frenchman, Aristide Moreau, which Maximilien highly disapproved of. After a childhood in Germany and an adolescence in France, where he attends Sciences-Po, he later returns to Germany to study at the University of Berlin and the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. It is also during this period when he joins the SS, eventually rising to the rank of Obersturmbannführer. Aue is a cultured, highly educated, classical music-loving intellectual. He speaks many languages fluently – German, French, Ancient Greek and Latin – and holds a doctorate in law. Despite his French heritage and upbringing, he is, like his father, an ardent German nationalist. Even after the war, he is unrepentant of the crimes he committed in the name of National Socialism, [...] "believing that it was my duty and that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> disagreeable or unpleasant as it may have been." [...] He is extremely attracted to his twin sister Una, which led to an incestuous relationship with her when they were children, but ended when they entered puberty. Refusing to truly love any woman other than Una, he becomes a homosexual but continues to fantasize about having sex with Una.|$|E

500|$|Rendering lead Jessica McMackin {{spoke about}} the use of ray tracing on the film, saying: [...] "In {{addition}} to creating accurate reflections, we used ray tracing to achieve other effects. We were able to use this approach to create accurate shadows, like when there are multiple light sources and {{you want to get a}} feathering of shadows at the edges. Or occlusion, which is the absence of ambient light between two surfaces, like a crease in a shirt. A fourth use is irradiance. An example of this would be if you had a piece of red paper and held it up to a white wall, the light would be colored by the paper and cast a red glow on the wall." [...] Character supervisor Tim Milliron explained that the film uses a ground–locking system that kept the cars firmly planted on the road, saying: [...] "The ground-locking system is one of the things I’m most proud of on this film. In the past, characters have never known about their environment in any way. A simulation pass was required if you wanted to make something like that happen. On Cars, this system is built into the models themselves, and as you move the car around, the vehicle sticks to the ground. It was one of those things that we do at Pixar where we knew going in that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> but we had no idea how to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Peel, having {{concluded}} that the suspension would end his Yorkshire career, signed a contract to play for Accrington Cricket Club. He told a newspaper that he regarded his suspension as unfair, {{that he had been}} given no opportunity to explain, and that he had taken the appointment with Accrington to provide for himself and his family. In 1900, he told Cricket magazine that, before his suspension, he had been bedridden for three weeks {{as a result of an}} injury he suffered while batting, that he played against Middlesex with some success and was then suspended without any explanation. He later said of the incident: [...] " [...] put his arm around me and escorted me off the field and out of Yorkshire cricket. What a gentleman". The journalist Harry Pearson suggests that this was [...] "either very gracious, or exceedingly sarcastic." [...] Hawke later described Peel's sacking as [...] "the most decisive action of my whole career... <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> for the sake of discipline and the good of cricket. Nothing ever gave me so much pain." [...] At the time, Hawke believed these events cost Yorkshire the County Championship, but the team had only two more games to play in that season's competition, and it was mathematically impossible for them to win. Hirst told Thompson that Hawke was always sorry that Peel had to be sacked, and that whenever the pair met afterwards, they remained friends and that neither bore the other any animosity. Although Peel considered himself indispensable, the following year he was replaced by Wilfred Rhodes, who remained in the team until 1930 and took 4,184 first-class wickets. Peel remained popular with the people of Morley in the aftermath of his dismissal, and they supported him rather than believing the reports.|$|E

The only way to get them {{to do it in the}} way <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> was to lead them myself." ...|$|E

It broke my heart to leave Steve but <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> I was ultimately the stronger". Due to the break-up of his marriage and growing drug use, some band members said that Marriott at times became domineering, aggressive and intolerable to work with. Humble Pie disbanded in 1975, citing musical differences {{as the reason for}} the split. Financial mismanagement and widespread substance abuse within the band also played a part.

2500|$|The {{innovation}} that met the room temperature challenge was the double heterostructure laser. The trick was to quickly move the wafer in the LPE apparatus between different [...] "melts" [...] of aluminum gallium arsenide (p- and n-type) {{and a third}} melt of gallium arsenide. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> rapidly since the gallium arsenide core region needed to be significantly under 1µm in thickness. The first laser diode to achieve continuous wave operation was a double heterostructure demonstrated in 1970 essentially simultaneously by Zhores Alferov and collaborators (including Dmitri Z. Garbuzov) of the Soviet Union, and Morton Panish and Izuo Hayashi working in the United States. However, it is widely accepted that Zhores I. Alferov and team reached the milestone first.|$|E
2500|$|The {{battleship}} SMS Westfalen altered {{course to}} south {{in order to}} avoid the conflict, but was ordered back to the original course at 2234, which Scheer perceived should now only be guarded by light forces. Jellicoe could also see that some action was taking place to his north. Goodenough reported the contact, though this was delayed as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> via Nottingham as Southampton's radio had been shot away. [...] Birmingham became separated from the squadron, but at 2315 passed on a brief sighting of German battlecruisers headed west by south. [...] This tended to discredit the Admiralty intelligence report of Scheer's intentions received at 2330, which stated German battlecruisers were now stationed at the rear of the fleet, which was headed ESE. Birmingham had sighted the ships while temporarily turned away to avoid British vessels.|$|E

2500|$|In 1891, Westcott's alleged {{correspondence}} with Anna Sprengel suddenly ceased.

If the founders were to contact the Secret Chiefs, apparently, <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> on their own. In 1892, Mathers professed that a link to the Secret Chiefs had been established. [...] Subsequently, he supplied rituals for the Second Order, calling them the Red Rose and Cross of Gold. The rituals were based on the tradition of the tomb of Christian Rosenkreuz, and a Vault of Adepts became the controlling force behind the Outer Order. Later in 1916, Westcott claimed that Mathers also constructed these rituals from materials he received from Frater Lux ex Tenebris, a purported Continental Adept.|$|E
2500|$|One of Baumann's most {{successful}} singles {{turned out to}} be his single [...] "Chihuahua" [...] which initially was released in 2002 and later re-released again Europe-wide. The track was produced upon the request of Coca-Cola in Spain. They were in search of an artist who could produce an attention-drawing mambo-song for their new campaign. However, the condition was that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> within a period of ten days. This task was completed and handed over to Coca-Cola by René and his co-producer Axel Breitung within the given time-limit.

It was certified Platinum in Switzerland for sales of over 40,000 units and in France the single reached a Diamond status for sales of over one million units.|$|E
2500|$|Robert J. Alexander {{writes that}} LaRouche first {{established}} an NCLC [...] "intelligence network" [...] in 1971. Members {{all over the}} world would send information to NCLC headquarters, which would distribute the information via briefings and other publications. LaRouche organized the network as a series of news services and magazines, which critics say was done to gain access to government officials under press cover. The publications included Executive Intelligence Review, founded in 1974. Other periodicals included New Solidarity, Fusion Magazine, 21st Century Science and Technology, and Campaigner Magazine. His news services and publishers included American System Publications, Campaigner Publications, New Solidarity International Press Service, and The New Benjamin Franklin House Publishing Company. LaRouche acknowledged in 1980 that his followers impersonated reporters and others, saying <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> for his security. In 1982, U.S. News and World Report sued New Solidarity International Press Service and Campaigner Publications for damages, alleging that members were impersonating its reporters in phone calls.|$|E

2500|$|Hoyle, unlike Gold and Bondi, {{offered an}} {{explanation}} for the appearance of new matter by postulating the existence of what he dubbed the [...] "creation field", or just the [...] "C-field", which had negative pressure in order to be consistent with the conservation of energy and drive the expansion of the universe. [...] These features of the C-field anticipated the later development of cosmic inflation. [...] They jointly argued that continuous creation was no more inexplicable than the appearance of the entire universe from nothing, although <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> on a regular basis. [...] In the end, mounting observational evidence convinced most cosmologists that the steady state model was incorrect and that the Big Bang was the theory that agreed best with observations, although Hoyle continued to support and develop his theory. [...] In 1993, in an attempt to explain some of the evidence against the steady state theory, he presented a modified version called [...] "quasi-steady state cosmology" [...] (QSS), but the theory is not widely accepted.|$|E
2500|$|Dilip Kumar and Madhubala {{first met}} {{on the set of}} Jwar Bhata (1944 film) when she was 11 years of age, and worked {{together}} again on the film Har Singaar(1949), which was shelved. Their relationship began two years later during the filming of Tarana (1951 film. They became a romantic pair appearing in a total of four films together. Actor Shammi Kapoor recalled that [...] "Dilip Kumar would drive down from Bombay to meet Madhubala... he even flew to Bombay to spend Eid with her, taking time off from his shooting stint..." [...] But, Madhubala's father Ataullah Khan did not give them permission to marry. Dilip Kumar said: [...] "She was a very, very obedient daughter", and who, in spite of the success, fame and wealth, submitted to the domination of her father and more often than not paid for his mistakes. [...] "This inability to leave her family was her greatest drawback", believed Shammi Kapoor, [...] "for <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> at some time." [...] The Naya Daur (1957 film) court case happened in 1956 when Dilip Kumar testified against Madhubala and her father in favor of director B.R. Chopra in open court. This struck a fatal blow to the Dilip-Madhubala relationship as it ended any chance of reconciliation between Dilip Kumar and Madhubala'a father. Reflecting on this, while Dilip Kumar said he was [...] "trapped", Shammi Kapoor felt [...] "this was something which went beyond him (Dilip) and he couldn’t control the whole situation..." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{personal}} and vocational {{experiences of the}} four co-writers were central to writing the script. Dinelaris' exposure to Broadway shaped the depictions of rehearsals and events backstage, though he admitted exaggerating these. He also felt his background writing long scenes of dialogue helped since scenes in the film [...] "were really more like play scenes". Iñárritu's own experiences influenced many of Birdmans themes. [...] "What this film talks about, I have been through," [...] Iñárritu recalled. [...] "I have seen and experienced all of it; it's what I have been living through {{the last years of}} my life." [...] Dinelaris described this aspect as [...] "a laughing look at oneself", but said <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in a comedic way otherwise [...] "it would have been the most unbelievably self-absorbed look at the subject". Themes from Raymond Carver's short story [...] "What We Talk About When We Talk About Love", which Riggan adapts for stage in the story, also influenced the script. Iñárritu wanted to find the connection between the themes in Riggan's story and those of Carver's. Because of this, it was important to the director that Carver's story be the subject of the play depicted within the film. Therefore, Iñárritu stated that his desire to use Carver's work was [...] "terrifying" [...] because the rights to using the Carver material were still subject to the possibility of being rejected during development of the film, but no issues arose. Carver's widow, writer Tess Gallagher, loved the script and permitted the adaptation, saying that Carver would be laughing about the film.|$|E
