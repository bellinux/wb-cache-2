5|$|After time <b>expires,</b> the chaser {{is given}} {{two minutes to}} catch the team by {{correctly}} answering {{a new series of}} questions, with each correct answer moving him one space along the board. If the chaser answers incorrectly or passes, the clock is stopped briefly and the team is given a chance to answer the question, which they may confirm among themselves before answering. A correct answer pushes the chaser back one space, or moves the team ahead by one if he has not moved on to the gameboard. An incorrect answer provides no movement for the chaser at all. Regardless of the outcome, the clock begins running again and the chaser continues to answer questions. If the chaser runs out of time before catching the team, the team splits the banked money equally, but if he catches them before time <b>expires,</b> the team leaves with no money. During celebrity episodes, if the chaser catches the team before time runs out, the team leaves with $15,000 divided equally.|$|E
5|$|Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare {{features}} team-based and deathmatch-based multiplayer modes {{on various}} maps. Each mode has an objective that requires unique strategies to complete. Players can call in UAV reconnaissance scans, air strikes, and attack helicopters, when they achieve three-, five-, and seven-enemy kill streaks respectively. A game ends when either a team or player {{has reached a}} predefined number of points, or the allotted time <b>expires</b> {{in which case the}} team or player with the most points wins. If the points are even when the time <b>expires,</b> Sudden Death mode is activated {{in which there is no}} re-spawning and the team who either has the last man standing, or achieves the objective first are the winners. If the player is in either of the two matches, then there is an Overtime match, in which the next team to win is rewarded the victory.|$|E

2500|$|Of these, N(dminus&) is the (risk-neutral) [...] "likelihood of <b>expiring</b> in the money", {{and thus}} the {{theoretically}} correct percent moneyness, with dminus& the correct moneyness. The percent moneyness is the implied probability that the derivative will <b>expire</b> in the money, in the risk-neutral measure.

5|$|A {{technical}} foul {{requires that the}} defenceman who fouled a player on the opposing team {{be placed in the}} penalty box for 30 seconds. As with a personal foul, until the penalty time <b>expires,</b> no replacement for the player is allowed and the team must play one man short. The player (or a replacement) is allowed to reenter the game once the time in the penalty box is over and the team is thus once again at full strength.|$|E
5|$|A two-minute minor {{penalty is}} often called for lesser infractions such as slashing, tripping, elbowing, roughing, too many players, illegal equipment, holding, or interference. Five-minute major {{penalties}} are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in intentional injury to an opponent, {{as well as for}} fighting. Players are released from the penalty box when either the penalty time <b>expires,</b> or the opposition scores a goal (or three goals for the instance of a major penalty).|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the <b>expired</b> bread meal used as corn substitution in the broiler diets to optimally the product performance. One hundred day old chick (DOC) male broilers were given the same diet until 2 weeks old, and then given the treatment diet until 7 weeks of age. A Completely Randomized Design {{was used in this}} study. Data were analyzed by variance of analysis, and followed by Duncan’s Multiple Range Test The treatments were: T 0 = control feed (without <b>expired</b> bread meal), T 1 = corn substituted with 10 % <b>expired</b> bread meal, T 2 = corn substituted with 20 % <b>expired</b> bread meal, T 3 = corn substituted with 30 % <b>expired</b> bread meal and T 4 = corn substituted with 40 % <b>expired</b> bread meal. The result indicated that corn substituted with <b>expired</b> bread meal up to 40 % has not significantly affected on carcass weight, carcass percentage and feed conversion, but decreased significantly on feed consumption and body weight gain. It can be concluded that the use of <b>expired</b> bread meal 30 % of the proportion of corn produced the most optimal broiler performance. The substitution corn with <b>expired</b> bread meal 40 % was decreased body weight gain...|$|R

5|$|Bounty Hunter: A new mode {{introduced}} in the game. If an online player creates too much chaos in the world, the mode will be initiated. Police, alongside one to three other players, will join the player's game {{with the hope of}} killing the hunted and claiming the bounty, which gives them experience points. The hunted could either strike back at the hunters by killing them, which gives them greater rewards, or escape from them until the bounty <b>expires.</b> The hunted, meanwhile, also can be assisted by another player if that player chooses to join the hunted. Players can manually place a bounty on themselves using the in-game smartphone.|$|E
