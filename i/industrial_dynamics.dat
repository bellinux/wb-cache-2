500|$|Despite {{the lack}} of American aid, the East European [...] "command economies", {{including}} Poland, made some progress in bridging the historically existing wealth gap with the market economy driven Western Europe. Because of the capital accumulation the Polish national income grew in real terms by over 76% and the agricultural and industrial production more than doubled between 1947 and 1950. The economic transition and industrialization were accompanied and made possible by massive social transformations, as peasants migrated and were converted into city dwelling working class (1.8 million between 1946 and 1955) and the country went {{through a period of}} rapid urbanization. The influx of cheap labor and the availability of the Soviet market facilitated an accumulation of resources, despite low productivity and insufficient investment in new technologies. The centrally planned socialist economies of Eastern Europe did relatively better than the West in terms of the post-war years growth, only to sustain economic damage later, especially after the 1973 oil crisis. However, the rise in living standards caused by the earlier <b>industrial</b> <b>dynamics</b> was not comparable to that in the West.|$|E

The study {{is based on the}} data of interbranch balances for 38 countries over the period of 1996 - 2011. In the selected groups of countries there have been studied: the dynamics and structure of the world industrial output, share of industry, dynamics and structure of the volume of <b>industrial</b> exports, <b>dynamics</b> of export orientation of the <b>industrial</b> production, <b>dynamics</b> of capacity of the domestic market for industrial products, structure of consumption of <b>industrial</b> products, <b>dynamics</b> and structure of the GDP of high-tech industries, dynamics of the share of the GDP of high-tech industries in the world industry GDP. There have been formed the rankings of top 20 producers, exporters and importers of industrial products in the world, leading countries in terms of capacity of the domestic market for industrial products, leading countries in terms of import dependence of the domestic market for industrial products in the world, leading countries in terms of the GDP volume of high-tech industries. Based on the conducted analysis it has been proved that the development of industry in developing countries is taking place in higher, as compared with developed ones, pace. High rates of industrial development in developing countries are ensured, first of all, by increasing their domestic market capacity. At the same time maintaining a high level of activity in the international market for industrial products still allows developed countries to keep the leading positions in rankings. The most industrially developed countries among the developing ones are Korea, China and India, and those among the developed countries are Germany, Japan and the United States. A significant advantage of the developed countries is observed in the production of high-tech products. Even considering the advantage in the GDP growth of high-tech industries in the developing countries, their share in the world total output is still significantly smaller...|$|R

It is the complementary study to that of an industry’s comparative statics, which still dominates economic analysis. <b>Industrial</b> <b>dynamics,</b> as studied by scholars such as Carlsson and Eliasson, reveal the basic underlying forces driving industry evolution. Some industries, particularly those with rapid product turnover or high levels of capital expenditure, reveal special dynamics moving through intrinsic upturns and downturns that are not necessarily related to the wider economic fluctuations. These are known as ‘cyclical industrial dynamics’. They have recently come under investigation in the specialized literature.|$|E

40|$|This article {{studies the}} <b>industrial</b> and {{aesthetic}} <b>dynamics</b> of transnational film remakes. If by «transnational remake» {{we understand that}} which «consists in making again a film in a different national context from the original one» (Berthier, 2007, p. 338), this research analyses both the production and circulation strategies and the narrative adaptation tactics involved in the remake process from a transnational perspective. In order to do so, we will examine the films ¿Quién mató a Bambi? (Santi Amodeo, 2013), remake of the Mexican film Matando Cabos (Alejandro Lozano, 2004) and Kiki, love to love (Paco León, 2016), {{a version of the}} Australian The Little Death (Josh Lawson, 2014). These cases operate as examples of adaptation processes in the Spanish context as well as tokens of remake fluxes beyond Hollywood. Attention to these films allows us to consider the existence of a potential transnational model of producing film remakes, while attending to the complex network of agents at play in buying and selling remake rights. Finally, the article reflects on the importance of industrial and academic uses of concepts such as «auteur», «film genre» or «national cinema», all of them key categories within <b>industrial</b> and aesthetic <b>dynamics</b> of contemporary film remakes...|$|R

In Tsiklauri, J Acoust Soc Am 112, 843 (2002), the effect of nonzero boundary slip velocity in fluid-saturated porous media was studied. Here we present a new advanced model of peristaltic flow which includes all relevant physical effects such as: non-zero boundary slip, non-Newtonian effects, and compressibility. Based on this model, the backflow (reflux) effect is also investigated which is a likely cause of vesico-ureteral reflux in urology. This study was motivated by the recent discovery of boundary slip Craig et al., Phys Rev Lett 87, 054504 (2001).
