5|$|In Birkenau, Vrba <b>had</b> <b>encountered</b> an {{acquaintance}} from Trnava, Alfréd Wetzler (prisoner no.29162), {{who was working}} in the mortuary. The two men hatched an escape plan, and on 7 April 1944, with the help of two other prisoners, they hid inside a pile of wood stacked between the camp's inner and outer perimeter fences, sprinkling the area with tobacco soaked in gasoline to fool the dogs.|$|E
5|$|Many Indians {{who joined}} the {{missions}} were looking for protection from Portuguese slave traders or the encomienda system of the Spanish conquistadores. In the reductions, the natives were free men. The land in the missions was common property. After a marriage, individual plots were assigned to newly founded families. For the Jesuits, the goal was always the same: to create cities {{in harmony with the}} paradise where they <b>had</b> <b>encountered</b> the indigenous peoples.|$|E

5|$|By 2006, the {{contractor}} <b>had</b> <b>encountered</b> delays due to material and worker shortages. The initial toll rates were announced in early 2007, {{with the lowest}} toll set at 75 cents. The toll road opened on November 19 of that year. The entire cost of the expressway portion was $843 million, paid for by South Bay Expressway to own the franchise on the tolled portion of SR 125. The interchange with SR 54 was constructed with $160 million of public funding.|$|E
5|$|By mid-morning, Hotze's {{advanced}} guard <b>had</b> <b>encountered</b> moderate French resistance first from Roget's brigade, and then, almost immediately, from Gazan's. The Austrian advance troops quickly overran Gazan's weak brigade and took {{possession of the}} woods surrounding the village of Islikon. After securing the villages of Gundeschwil, Schottikon, Wiesendangen, and Stogen, further west of Islikon, Hotze deployed two of his columns facing the French front, while a third angled to the French right, as Ney had expected he would.|$|E

5|$|Hergé also {{introduced}} a new character, Peggy Alcazar, whom he had based upon the American secretary to a Ku Klux Klan spokesman whom Hergé observed in a television documentary. In his preparatory notes for the story, Hergé had considered introducing Peggy {{as the daughter of}} arms dealer Basil Bazaroff– the satirical depiction of the old times real-life arms dealer Basil Zaharoff, who had appeared in The Broken Ear. He {{also introduced}} the Jolly Follies into the story, a group who were based on three separate touring party groups that Hergé <b>had</b> <b>encountered.</b> He had initially considered a number of alternative names for the troupe, including the Turlupins, Turlurans, and Boutentrins.|$|E
5|$|In {{the evening}} of July 23, 1st Battalion sent a 30-man patrol northward to locate the North Koreans. Near Poun, the patrol spotted a North Korean column approaching. The platoon took up {{superior}} positions and ambushed the column as it passed with all its weapons. The North Koreans halted their advance, thinking they <b>had</b> <b>encountered</b> a major position, and held back until daylight. When they turned back, the US patrol returned to the 1st Battalion lines at 04:00 on July 24. It suffered six men missing to {{an unknown number of}} North Korean casualties.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1794, Thomson {{spoke with}} a ship that was sailing for Botany Bay. The ship <b>had</b> <b>encountered</b> a French privateer, of 14 guns, which the British ship managed to drive off after an {{engagement}} that lasted almost two hours. Reportedly, Prince of Wales went on to recapture a British brig that a French 74-gun ship of the line had captured. Prince of Wales sent the brig into Oporto. However, {{this may have been}} Best. Lastly, in early 1974, Prince of Wales captured and brought in Flugen, of Malmö, which had been carrying wine, brandy, and bale goods from Bordeaux to Saint-Domingue.|$|E

5|$|On 20 December 1943, the under-strength Loyal Edmonton Regiment {{moved toward}} Ortona, with the Seaforth Highlanders {{covering}} their eastern flank. Throughout the day, they encountered {{heavy machine gun}} fire during their attempts to enter Ortona. By nightfall, both battalions held a toehold on {{the western edge of}} Ortona, yet <b>had</b> <b>encountered</b> heavy resistance in their attempts to secure it. The following day, D Company of the Loyal Edmonton Regiment launched attacks eastward towards the city centre, but accurate German sniper fire rapidly stalled the advance.|$|E
5|$|On January 3, 2008, IGN {{reported}} that Valve employees {{had created a}} thread on Valve's website forums for players to list the problems they <b>had</b> <b>encountered</b> and to suggest fixes, which caused speculation that a patch was being planned to address the issues in the PlayStation 3 version, such as the frame rate issues, the connection problems in Team Fortress 2, and the slow loading times in Portal. A patch for the PlayStation 3 version was later released in North America on March 19, 2008 and in Europe a short while after that; however, it {{made no mention of}} fixing frame rate issues or slow loading times.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Atlus {{picking up}} the title, Vanillaware <b>had</b> <b>encountered</b> {{difficulties}} finding a publisher due to Kamitani's sparse record as a developer. Completed in 2006, Odin Sphere was delayed into the following year so it would not compete with Atlus' own titles. The localization was handled by Atlus USA, and proved challenging in multiple areas. Upon release, it garnered a positive reception from video game journalists: praise was given to its story, visuals and old-school gameplay, with criticism focused on its inventory system and framerate issues. Leifthrasir was praised for its improved performance and reworked mechanics. The game was a commercial success, contributing {{to the rise of}} Vanillaware as a developer.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after its}} release, Windows RT 8.1 was {{temporarily}} recalled by Microsoft following reports that some users <b>had</b> <b>encountered</b> a rare bug which corrupted the operating system's Boot Configuration Data during installation, {{resulting in an}} error on startup. On October 21, 2013, Microsoft confirmed that the bug {{was limited to the}} original Surface tablet, and only affected 1 in 1000 installations. The company released recovery media and instructions which could be used to repair the device, and restored access to Windows RT 8.1 the next day.|$|E
5|$|The Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) was a joint NASA/ESA {{proposal}} for exploration of Jupiter and its moons. In February 2009 {{it was announced}} that both space agencies had given this mission priority ahead of the Titan Saturn System Mission. The proposal included a launch date of around 2020 and consists of the NASA-led Jupiter Europa Orbiter, and the ESA-led Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter. ESA's contribution <b>had</b> <b>encountered</b> funding competition from other ESA projects. However, the Jupiter Europa Orbiter (JEO), NASA's contribution, was considered by the Planetary Decadal Survey to be too expensive. The survey supported a cheaper alternative to JEO.|$|E
5|$|The Mask of Zorro was {{initially}} set for release on December 19, 1997 before the release date {{was changed to}} March 1998. There was speculation within the media about whether TriStar changed the date {{in an attempt to}} avoid competition with Titanic. In reality Zorro <b>had</b> <b>encountered</b> production problems that extended its shooting schedule. In addition, Sony Pictures Entertainment, TriStar's parent company, wanted an action film for its first quarter releases of 1998. The release date was once again pushed back, this time to July 1998, when pick-ups were commissioned. The delay from March to July added $3 million in interest costs.|$|E

5|$|After his {{accidental}} discovery, Reinitzer did {{not pursue}} studying liquid crystals further. The research was continued by Lehmann, who {{realized that he}} <b>had</b> <b>encountered</b> a new phenomenon and {{was in a position}} to investigate it: In his postdoctoral years he had acquired expertise in crystallography and microscopy. Lehmann started a systematic study, first of cholesteryl benzoate, and then of related compounds which exhibited the double-melting phenomenon. He was able to make observations in polarized light, and his microscope was equipped with a hot stage (sample holder equipped with a heater) enabling high temperature observations. The intermediate cloudy phase clearly sustained flow, but other features, particularly the signature under a microscope, convinced Lehmann that he was dealing with a solid. By the end of August 1889 he had published his results in the Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie.|$|E
5|$|After {{the loss}} of G-ALYV, the Central Government of India convened a court of inquiry to examine {{the cause of the}} accident. Professor Natesan Srinivasan joined the inquiry as the main {{technical}} expert. A large portion of the aircraft was recovered and reassembled at Farnborough, during which the break-up was found to have begun with a left elevator spar failure in the stabilizer. The inquiry concluded that the aircraft <b>had</b> <b>encountered</b> extreme negative G forces during takeoff; severe turbulence generated by adverse weather was determined to have induced down-loading, leading to {{the loss of}} the wings. Examination of the cockpit controls suggested that the pilot may have inadvertently over-stressed the aircraft when pulling out of a steep dive by over-manipulation of the fully powered flight controls. Investigators did not consider metal fatigue as a contributory cause.|$|E
