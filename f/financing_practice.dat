Identification and analysis of limited hospitality development factors imply very complex scientific approach. Case study methodology is applied on Republic of Serbia, which is transition country and candidate for EU accession. Research results identified key factors which had impact on lag, stagnation and contemporary level of hospitality development. Firstly, way of executed privatization process of hospitality companies in Serbia i. e. only ownership transformation, as part of business transformation, was done (organizational, management, technological, financial and human resources parts of business transformation didn’t implement). Secondly, non-acceptable terms and conditions of credit lines for financing privatization and future business of privatized hospitality companies. Furthermore, buyers of privatized hospitality companies didn’t prepared adequate projections of cash flow and sources of financing (owned and borrowed). Finally, technological development and human resources were result of the first mentioned limited factor. In order to improve business in hospitality industry in transition economies, all stakeholders should be involved. State should improve business environment.

40|$|Financial {{institutions}} {{are seeking to}} leverage {{the value of the}} cash that emigrant workers remit to their home countries. Specifically, banks in developing countries have securitized remittance cash flows. The size and stability of worker remittances have caused a surge of interest among financial institutions, academics and others in recent years. Remittance securitizations - or, issuances of remittance-backed bonds - present specific instances in which parties in remittance-receiving countries have actually harnessed the value of remittances in order to access capital markets. Remittance flow securitization can enable developing region banks to raise funds at advantageous rates. Because these future-flow transactions depend upon the bank 2 ̆ 7 s capacity to retain or grow its market share of the cash flow securitized, they present an opportunity to ensure better services and lower costs to remittance senders and receivers. Remittance securitization could provide strong incentive for banking with the poor. Worker remittances are generated by emigration that can deprive communities of human capital necessary to effectuate development locally. This article considers possibilities for, and the propriety of, structuring these securitizations to maximize their development potential for remittance-receiving communities. The article explains how remittance securitization works and develops a list of questions to consider in assessing the implications for development of this <b>financing</b> <b>practice...</b>|$|E

40|$|Malaysia, {{like any}} other {{developing}} country, considers the construction industry as one the main contributors to its Gross Domestic Product (GDP). However, there are unresolved issues arising from the ongoing and widespread adoption of the traditional method of construction. Among them are the resultant fragmentation of the industry itself; delays in production and delivery time; unnecessary wastages and lack of sustainability practice. As such the Malaysian Government has been continuously encouraging the industry to use, partly or if not wholly, the Industrialised Building System (IBS) which {{is considered to be}} an important part of sustainable construction initiative. The IBS albeit in its crude form is not new in Malaysia and was introduced in the country over 40 years ago through government-led affordable housing projects. However, the system has so far failed to gather momentum. A number of barriers to its implementation are identified from a survey of pertinent literature sources by a number of local researchers. The main barriers are related to the perception that the system incurs additional costs; the <b>financing</b> <b>practice</b> that does not support the adoption of the system; the lack of skills and knowledge on the IBS; project delivery and supply chain matters; negative perception of stakeholders [mainly clients, professionals and end-users] on the flexibility of the system; and the lack of incentives and seriousness in its promotion by the decision makers both in the public and private sectors. Based on the review on the available literature sources. this paper discusses the identified barriers with the aim of examining how far these barriers may well affect the process of IBS implementation in the Malaysian construction industry...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{relationship}} between corporate governance and corporate valuation, ownership structure and need of external financing for the Karachi Stock Market is examined for the period 2003 to 2008. To measure the firm- level governance a rating system is {{used to evaluate the}} stringency of a set of governance practices and cover various governance categories : such as board composition, ownership and shareholdings and transparency, disclosure and auditing. The sample consists of 60 non-financial firms listed on Karachi Stock Exchange and comprises more than 80 percent of market capitalization at Karachi Stock Market in 2007. The results confirms the theoretical notion that firms with better investment opportunities and larger in size adopt better corporate governance practice. The proposition that ownership concentration is a response to poor legal protection is also validated by the results. The more investment opportunities lead to more concentration of ownership and the ownership concentration is significantly diluted as the firm size expands. The findings are consistent with theoretical argument claiming that family owners, foreign owners and bring better governance and monitoring practices which is consistent with agency theory. The results suggest that firms which need more equity <b>financing</b> <b>practice</b> good governance. The results show that firms with high growth and large in size are in more need of external finance. The relationship between external financing and ownership concentration is negative. The results reveal that the firms which practice good governance, with concentrated ownership, need more external finance which have more profitable investment opportunities and are larger in size are valued higher. The interaction term of any variable with law enforcement term are not significant in any model suggesting that firm performance is not affected by rule of law in countries where legal environment is weak. These results adds an important link to the explanation of the consequences weak legal environment for external financing, corporate valuation and corporate governance. The results show that Corporate Governance Code 2002 potentially improves the governance and decision making process of firms listed at KSE.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{understand}} {{the economic impact of}} centralized and decentralized ownership structures and their corresponding pricing and investment strategies on transportation network performance and social welfare for travelers. In a decentralized network economic system, roads are owned by many agencies or companies that are responsible for pricing and investment strategies. The motivation of this study is two-fold. First, the question of which ownership structure, or industrial organization, is optimal for transportation networks has yet to be resolved. Despite several books devoted to this research issue, quantitative methods that translate ownership-related policy variables into short- and long-run network performance are lacking. Second, the U. S. and many other countries have recently seen a slowly but steadily increasing popularity of road pricing as an alternative to traditional fuel taxes. Not only is the private sector encouraged to finance new roads, this transition in revenue mechanism also makes it possible for lower-level government agencies and smaller jurisdictions to participate in network pricing and investment practice. The issue of optimal ownership is no longer a purely theoretical debate, but bears practical importance. This research adopts an agent-based simulator of network dynamics to explore the implications of centralized and decentralized ownership on mobility and social welfare, as well as potential financial issues and regulatory needs. Components of the simulator: the travel demand model, cost functions, and key variables of pricing and investment strategies, are empirically estimated and validated. Results suggest that road network is a market with imperfect competition. While there is a significant performance lag between the optimal strategy and the current network <b>financing</b> <b>practice</b> in the U. S. (characterized by centralized control, fuel taxes, and budget-balancing investment), a completely decentralized network suffers from issues such as higher-than-optimal tolls and over-investment. For the decentralized ownership structure, appropriate regulation on pricing and investment practices is necessary. Further analysis based on simulation comparisons suggests that with appropriate price regulation, a decentralized road economy consisting of profit-seeking road owners could outperform the existing centralized control, achieve net social benefits close to the theoretical optimum, and distribute a high percentage of welfare gains to travelers. Decentralized control is especially valuable in rapidly changing environments because it promptly responds to travel demand. These results seem to favor the idea of privatizing or decentralizing road ownership on congested networks. Further tests on real-world transportation networks are necessary and should make an interesting future study.
