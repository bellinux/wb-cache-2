Titanium alloys are {{desirable}} {{materials for}} aerospace industry {{because of their}} excellent combination of high specific strength, lightweight, fracture resistant characteristics, and general corrosion resistance.

Several different methods of assessing the wear modes and mechanisms have been previously reported, further work has been undertaken in the above area to relate wear with quantified parameters of forces and specific cutting energy. For bandsawing of austenitic stainless steel, the major wear mode {{is associated with the}} rounding of the cutting edge and forming of a worn flank. The change in cutting edge geometry leads to an increase in cutting forces and hence changes to the specific cutting energy.

40|$|Abstract. When metal {{is removed}} by {{machining}} {{there is substantial}} increase in the specific energy required with decrease in chip size. It is generally believed {{this is due to}} the fact that all metals contain defects (grain boundaries, missing and impurity atoms, etc.), and when the size of the material removed decreases, the probability of encountering a stress-reducing defect decreases. Since the shear stress and strain in metal cutting is unusually high, discontinuous microcracks usually form on the metal-cutting shear plane. If the material being cut is very brittle, or the compressive stress on the shear plane is relatively low, microcracks grow into gross cracks giving rise to <b>discontinuous</b> <b>chip</b> formation. When discontinuous microcracks form on the shear plane they weld and reform as strain proceeds, thus joining the transport of dislocations in accounting for the total slip of the shear plane. In the presence of a contaminant, such as CCl 4 vapour at a low cutting speed, the rewelding of microcracks decreases, resulting in decrease in the cutting force required for chip formation. A number of special experiments are described in the paper that support the transport of microcracks across the shear plane, an...|$|E

The results reveal that the surface roughness values are less for coated carbide tools compared to carbide and are minimum for PCD tools. The incorporation of graphite in Al 2219 / 15 SiCp composite increases the surface roughness.

Coated and uncoated carbides, ceramic, and cermet cutting tool inserts of a square geometry (SNG 432 type) were used. Round stock workpieces were tested in the as - received, unaged condition and without using any cutting fluid. The turning tests for each tool material were conducted by (i) first establishing the cutting conditions {{that would allow the}} continued generation of broken chips during a given cutting test, (ii) measuring intermittently the flank wear as a function of cutting time under such established cutting conditions for <b>discontinuous</b> broken <b>chips,</b> and (iii) determining the tool life using the criteria specified in the ISO Standard 3685 : 1993 (E).

40|$|In cutting {{operations}} by multipoint {{cutting tools}} such as bandsawing, the layer of material removed per tooth (5 – 30 ?m) is usually {{less than or equal}} to the cutting edge radius (5 – 15 ?m). Furthermore, the bandsaw tooth is also restricted since it has to accommodate the chip in a gullet of limited size. This situation can lead to inefficient metal removal by a combination of piling up, <b>discontinuous</b> <b>chip</b> formation and ploughing action in contrast to the cutting operations by most of the single point cutting tools (e. g., turning). Specific Cutting Energy (ESP) is a better way of measuring the efficiency of the metal cutting process compared to the other processes such as determining tool wear, cutting forces, chip ratio, etc. This paper reports on the full bandsawing tests of three different workpiece materials (Ball bearing steel, Stainless steel and Ni–Cr–Mo steel). The increase of ESP throughout the life of the bandsaw reflected the degradation of the cutting performance due to the wear of the cutting edge geometry for Ball bearing and Stainless steels. However, there was no increase in ESP when cutting Ni–Cr–Mo steel, which could be explained by the existence of a large protective built-up edge and/or minimal blade wear. The variation of the ESP in different workpiece materials will also provide valuable information for bandsaw manufacturers and end users to estimate machinability characteristics for selected workpieces...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHeat treated Ductile Iron with {{austenitic-ferritic}} matrix (ADI) has a {{high potential}} for the substitution of forged steel and conventional Ductile Iron. Advantages of ADI compared to steel are good castability and lower density. In comparison to conventional Ductile Iron, the increased ratio of tensile strength/ductility with higher resistance against abrasive wear and durability are of advantage. In the industrial applications, the material sided advantages are counterbalanced by the higher costs of the demanding machining, especially in rough turning operations. In this presentation, the development of cutting inserts for high performance turning operations, which are adapted on the specific requirements of the machining of ADI 900, are described. In the first step, the particular machinability, which {{can be traced back}} to the metallic matrix, was specified. The characteristic, <b>discontinuous</b> <b>chip</b> formation in combination with the strong tendency of hardening of the austenitic− ferritic matrix was identified as a major wear mechanism, resulting in extreme peaks of cutting forces and high specific mechanical load on the insert edge. For an enhanced evaluation of chip formation and the resultant thermomechanical tool load, a 3 D FEM simulation model was developed. By using this 3 D simulation model of the longitudinal external turning process, the maximum cutting forces were specified in addition to the influence of the chip segment formation frequency. The obtained results from the simulation have been used to develop an optimised insert geometry. By using the optimised tool, an increased tool life of 70 % could be observed.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is the turning of Al 2124 SiCp (45 % wt) Metal Matrix Composite using PCD, CBN-coated and CBN-uncoated tools. The {{machinability}} of Al 2124 SiCp (45 % wt) Metal Matrix Composite is evaluated by measurement of tool wear, surface finish and dimensional accuracy of the work-piece. Wear mechanisms and patterns of tools in turning of Al 2124 SiCp (45 % wt) Metal Matrix Composite are discussed. The experimental setup involved turning Al 2124 SiCp (45 % wt) 78. 0 mm long and 31. 8 mm diameter on a precision lathe at fixed feed rate, different depth of cut and cutting speed using PCD, CBN-coated and CBN-uncoated tools. The reinforcement of the matrix consists of SiC 5 - 8 µm in diameter. Experimental results reveal that abrasion and adhesion presented the most prevalent mode of wear among all the tools. Fracture was observed among CBN tools while chipping on PCD tools. Flank and crater wear were observed in all tools with flank wear more prevalent in both CBN-coated and CBN-uncoated. Wear among PCD tools was low as compared to CBN tools. Further analysis reveal that the outer layer of the CBN-coated tools wear off fast creating a good platform for adhesion of matrix material on to the tool. This further increases wear of the tool due to adhesive wear as the built-up edge breaks off from the tool. PCD tool presented better surface finish than CBN tools with CBN-coated performing better than CBN-uncoated. Due to high SiC content, <b>discontinuous</b> <b>chips</b> are formed which are also curled due to increase in temperature at cutting zone causing bimetallic effect on the chip.

40|$|Brittle {{materials}} such as silicon, germanium, glass and ceramics are widely used in semiconductor, optical, micro-electronics and various other fields. Traditionally, grinding, polishing and lapping have been employed to achieve high tolerance in surface texture of silicon wafers in semiconductor applications, lenses for optical instruments etc. The conventional machining processes such as single point turning and milling are not conducive to brittle materials as they produce <b>discontinuous</b> <b>chips</b> owing to brittle failure at the shear plane before any tangible plastic flow occurs. In order to improve surface finish on machined brittle materials, ductile regime machining is being extensively studied lately. The process of machining brittle materials where the material is removed by plastic flow, thus leaving a crack free surface is known as ductile-regime machining. Ductile machining of brittle materials can produce surfaces of very high quality comparable with processes such as polishing, lapping etc. The objective of this project {{is to develop a}} comprehensive predictive model for ductile machining of brittle materials. The model would predict the critical undeformed chip thickness required to achieve ductile-regime machining. The input to the model includes tool geometry, workpiece material properties and machining process parameters. The fact that the scale of ductile regime machining is very small leads to a number of factors assuming significance which would otherwise be neglected. The effects of tool edge radius, grain size, grain boundaries, crystal orientation etc. are studied so as to make better predictions of forces and hence the critical undeformed chip thickness. The model is validated using a series of experiments with varying materials and cutting conditions. This research would aid in predicting forces and undeformed chip thickness values for micro-machining brittle materials given their material properties and process conditions. The output could be used to machine brittle materials without fracture and hence preserve their surface texture quality. The need for resorting to experimental trial and error is greatly reduced as the critical parameter, namely undeformed chip thickness, is predicted using this approach. This can in turn pave way for brittle materials to be utilized in a variety of applications. Ph. D.

An experimental investigation {{has been conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of different cutting speed and feed rate on the machinability of the alloy. The machinability of the AA 6012 A-T 6 alloy, where Pb is substituted by Bi and Sn, has then been compared to the standard AA 6012 -T 6 (AlMgSiPb) and AA 6082 -T 6 (AlSiMg) alloys. The results indicate that the extensive plastic deformation induces a preferred orientation of the grain structure and secondary phases along the shear plane, and a local increase in the alloy temperature. Low melting point compounds, such as the Sn- and Bi-bearings particles, transform into a soft or liquid state, change their initial compact shape to assume a needle-like morphology. The β-Mg 2 Si and α-Al(FeMn) Si particles are not influenced by the working temperature and keep the initial shape.

This model is verified by comparison with experimental results. It is shown from the simulation results that as the cutting speeds are increased the stress state near the tool tip changes, leading to the crack propagation shifting from the tool tip to the free surface of the deformed chip in the shear zone. This change in crack initiation and propagation is the primary reason for the chip changing from the discontinuous to a segregated continuous morphology...|$|R

To simulate the production trimming process under a laboratory accelerated fatigue condition, a trim die simulator and testing technique have been developed. In this test 12 ̆ 2 cubic die samples were used that offers total 12 cutting edges of 6 different material grain orientations in shearing, and with adjustable die clearance. A non-contact metal removal volume measurement was developed to quantify the degree of fatigue damage during cyclic loading, and the metallurgical replica method was used at different number of cycles from the interrupted testing for obtaining micro-damage information. The damage rate {{at the cutting edge}} was obtained as a function of trimming process variables, including the die material grain orientations, the loading frequency, and the amplitude of fatigue loading. The microstructure, micro-damage and fractured surfaces were examined with optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The results show that there exist two types of distinct damage processes: the continuous contact deformation process that occurs at a low fatigue load, and the <b>discontinuous</b> cutting edge <b>chipping</b> process at a high fatigue loading with significantly higher material removal rate. The chipping involves crack initiation and propagation within the carbide phase surrounding the pro-eutectic grains, leading to grain broken and fall apart.
