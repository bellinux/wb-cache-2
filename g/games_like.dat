5|$|Though new {{classical}} roguelike variants {{would continue}} to be developed within the Western market, the genre languished as more advanced personal computers capable of improved graphics capabilities and games that utilized these features became popular. However, some of these new graphical games drew influence for roguelike concepts, notably action role-playing <b>games</b> <b>like</b> Blizzard Entertainment's Diablo (1996). Diablos creator, David Brevik, acknowledged that <b>games</b> <b>like</b> Rogue, Nethack, Telengard and other roguelikes influenced the design of Diablo, including the nature of randomly generated dungeons and loot.|$|E
5|$|While endgame tablebases {{for other}} board <b>games</b> <b>like</b> checkers, chess {{variants}} or Nine Men's Morris exist, when a game is not specified, {{it is assumed}} to be chess.|$|E

5|$|Author Masaru Takeuchi {{attributes}} {{the origin of}} the quick time event game mechanic to laserdisc <b>games</b> <b>like</b> Dragon's Lair and Time Gal. IGN's Levi Buchanan listed FMV <b>games</b> <b>like</b> Time Gal as one of the reasons behind the Mega-CD's commercial failure, citing them as a waste of the system's capabilities. Ciolek referred to the protagonist {{as one of the first}} human heroines in the industry. He further added that Reika was an appealing lead character that Taito could have easily turned into a mascot and featured in other games and media. The character was later included in Alfa System's shooting game Castle of Shikigami III—Taito published the arcade version in Japan. In the game, Reika features similar attacks and personality but the character's visual design was updated. Reika's most recent appearance was in the Elevator Action remake Elevator Action Deluxe as one of the few free Taito DLCs.|$|E
5|$|Space Run is {{developed}} by one-man studio PASSTECH Games, located in Lyon, France. Programmer Sylvain Passot founded the studio in October 2012. Passot {{has said that}} Space Run was inspired by Galaxy Trucker, a boardgame by Vlaada Chvatil, as well as accessible <b>games</b> <b>like</b> Plants vs. Zombies.|$|E
5|$|Storm of Zehir was {{inspired}} by older video <b>games</b> <b>like</b> the Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale franchises. The storyline foreshadows {{the events of the}} fourth edition of Dungeons & Dragons and follows the adventures of a group of merchants in the Samarach and Sword Coast areas of the Forgotten Realms campaign setting.|$|E

5|$|The Pinball of the Dead {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} video game critics, receiving an Editor's Choice award on GameZone. Critics praised the graphics and sound while its gameplay physics was more mixed. It also received several comparisons to other pinball <b>games</b> <b>like</b> Devil's Crush. In 2005, {{the game was}} later {{called one of the}} best games of all time from gaming magazine Nintendo Power.|$|E
5|$|Yannick LeJacq of Kotaku, {{commenting on}} the 2014 game MouseCraft which {{incorporates}} elements of Lemmings and Tetris, speculated that <b>games</b> <b>like</b> Lemmings would not be very successful in the current gaming market, as {{the pace of the}} game is far too slow to satisfy most players.|$|E
5|$|According to Yager Development, 2K never {{discussed}} {{the chance of}} developing a sequel during the game's development. Timo Ullman, managing director of Yager stated that the game failed to compete with other shooters, and that market for <b>games</b> <b>like</b> Spec Ops: The Line is too small. As a result, the team would {{not return to the}} franchise. Team members expressed a desire to move on and develop a game that has a much lighter tone.|$|E
50|$|This <b>game,</b> <b>like</b> most of {{the other}} {{unlicensed}} Nintendo Entertainment System games, did not sell very well.|$|R

5|$|Despite these setbacks, {{the rhythm}} game market {{continues}} to expand, introducing {{a number of}} danced-based <b>games</b> <b>like</b> Ubisoft's Just Dance and Harmonix's Dance Central that incorporate the use of motion controllers and camera-based controls like the Kinect. Existing games also continue to thrive on new business models, such as the reliance on downloadable content to provide songs to players. The introduction of {{the new generation of}} console hardware has also spurred return of Activision's Guitar Hero and Harmonix's Rock Band titles in late 2015.|$|E
5|$|Edea is one {{of three}} {{character}} concepts, along with Fujin and Raijin, to have been created before Final Fantasy VIII. Tetsuya Nomura had designed Edea even before the development of Final Fantasy VII, based on the style of Yoshitaka Amano, who was the character illustrator of Final Fantasy VI and previous games. In Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, Edea's design is used as an alternate costume of Ultimecia's. Although she has not appeared in Final Fantasy spin off <b>games</b> <b>like</b> Dissidia, her namesake has been carried into the Bravely Default series with Edea Lee.|$|E
5|$|PlayStation Plus, a subscription-based {{service on}} the PlayStation Network, {{compliments}} the standard PSN services. It enables an auto-download feature which allows the console to automatically download game patches and system software updates. Subscribers also gain early or exclusive access to some betas, game demos, premium downloadable content (such as full game trials of retail <b>games</b> <b>like</b> Infamous and LittleBigPlanet) and other PlayStation Store items, {{as well as a}} free subscription to Qore. Other downloadable items include PlayStation Store discounts and free PlayStation Network games, PS one Classics, PlayStation Minis, themes and avatars.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{preferred}} the Nintendo64 port over the arcade release, and appreciated its audiovisual enhancements, but felt that its graphical upgrades and memorization-based combo gameplay were insufficient {{when compared to}} fighting <b>games</b> <b>like</b> Tekken 2 and Virtua Fighter 2. Critics recommended Gold primarily for fans of the series and genre, but IGN reported that even fans were upset by changes in the combo system {{and the absence of}} several well-liked characters. Gold ultimately did not replicate the success of its Super NES predecessor, and the series remained dormant through its 2002 acquisition by Microsoft until its 2013 reboot.|$|E
5|$|Since {{opening its}} first store in 1998, the NBA has seen {{increasing}} business opportunities in foreign markets mainly {{due to the}} influx of new international players. The biggest growth has been in China, where players Yao Ming and Yi Jianlian, combined with the interest generated by the 2008 Summer Olympics, created enough demand to open two new stores. The NBA has also expanded into <b>games</b> <b>like</b> Second Life where it created a virtual NBA Store in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{first modern}} chess tournament was {{organized}} by Howard Staunton, a leading English chess player, and was held in London in 1851. It was won by the German Adolf Anderssen, who was hailed as the leading chess master. His brilliant, energetic attacking style was typical for the time. Sparkling <b>games</b> <b>like</b> Anderssen's Immortal game and Evergreen game or Morphy's Opera game were regarded as the highest possible summit of the chess art.|$|E

5|$|After construction, Morris invited {{friends to}} visit, most notably Burne-Jones {{and his wife}} Georgiana, as well as Rossetti and his wife Lizzie Siddal. They aided him in {{painting}} murals on the furniture, walls, and ceilings, much of it based on Arthurian tales, the Trojan War, and Geoffrey Chaucer's stories, while he also designed floral embroideries for the rooms. They also spent much time playing tricks on each other, enjoying <b>games</b> <b>like</b> hide and seek, and singing while accompanied by the piano. Siddall stayed at the House during summer and autumn 1861 as she recovered from a traumatic miscarriage and an addiction to laudanum; she would die of an overdose in February 1862.|$|E
5|$|After {{showing the}} game at the Macworld Expo, Bungie was mobbed with {{interest}} and orders for the game. The game was not finished until December 14, 1994; Jones {{and a few other}} employees spent a day at a warehouse assembling boxes so that some of the orders could be filled before Christmas. The game was a critical and commercial success, and is regarded as a relatively unknown but important part of gaming history. It served as the Mac alternative to DOS PC-only <b>games</b> <b>like</b> Doom and System Shock. The game's volume of orders was unprecedented for the studio, who found that its old method of mail or phone orders could not scale to the demand and hired another company to handle {{the tens of thousands of}} orders. Marathon also brought Bungie attention from press outside the small Mac gaming market.|$|E
5|$|At that time, the {{demography}} for the PlayStation shifted as more {{teenagers and}} children started {{to use the}} console to play video games. As a result, the team decided not to make another violent game like Disruptor and instead develop a family-friendly game that would be suitable for every member of a family, regardless of their age. The family game market was dominated by Sony's competitor Nintendo with <b>games</b> <b>like</b> Super Mario 64, while the PlayStation has no similar exclusives. Cerny later pushed Insomniac Games to develop a game with a mascot and mass appeal. An environment artist of Disruptor, Craig Stitt proposed that the game's theme and story should revolve around an anthropomorphic dragon. At the same time, Alex Hastings began developing an engine that specialized in games with panoramic view, which is suitable for open world games. The engine allowed more gameplay features including the ability for the dragon to glide through air. Spyro the Dragon was released in late 1998.|$|E
