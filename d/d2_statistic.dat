40|$|Pearlmillet is an {{important}} cereal crop of the semi arid-tropical region. As a result the crop productivity is challenged in most cultivable regions. In order to enhance the productivity in dry regions, breeders need access to diverse material in their breeding programmes. In the present study, {{an attempt was made}} to assess the genetic divergence among the 243 germplasm lines using Mahalanobis <b>D²</b> <b>statistic.</b> Based on the genetic distance (D 2 value), the 243 genotypes were grouped into 16 different clusters indicating diverse nature of material studied. Cluster I was the largest with 129 genotypes followed by cluster III (49 genotypes) and cluster V (24 genotypes) while clusters II and VI, VII, VIII and X to XVI were solitary indicating the grouping of exotic collections in definite groups. Among the various characters, seed yield (27. 45...|$|E
40|$|In Northern {{dry zone}} of Karnataka lot of {{variability}} exists in horse gram crop as many farmers are growing local cultivarswhich {{are resistant to}} iron chlorosis and also to diseases and pest with high forage yield. In the present study, an attempt wasmade to assess the genetic divergence among the 100 germplasm lines using Mahalanobis <b>D²</b> <b>statistic</b> collected fromdifferent sources including local checks and the experiment was carried out during late Kharif season of 2009 at RARS,Bijapur. The observations were recorded on seed yield and its components. The 100 germplasm lines that were grouped intoeighteen different clusters based on D² analysis revealed that Cluster I was the largest with 19 genotypes followed by clusterIII (14) and cluster V (13). Cluster XII showed the maximum mean value for seed yield. The intra and inter clusterdivergence among the genotypes was varying in magnitude. Further it was implied that intra-cluster distance was maximumin cluster III followed by clusters XI and XIII. The widest inter cluster distance was noted between cluster XII and XVgiving scope for hybridization programme with improvement of genotypes. The distance between clusters X and V wasminimum indicating close relationship between those clusters...|$|E
40|$|Discriminant {{function}} analysis (DFA) is {{a multivariate}} statistical technique {{that provides a}} non-subjective means of correlating tephra deposits based on compositional or other variable characteristics. Using microprobe-determined glass shard major element composition, two DFA classification models were developed to separate (distinguish) individual tephra deposits erupted since ca. 22 ka {{from each of the}} rhyolitic Okataina and Taupo volcanoes, North Island, New Zealand. In an iterative approach, those tephras easily classified in the first DFA are removed from the dataset before applying the second DFA, hence generally improving the separation of the remaining tephras that are more closely alike. The first two canonical functions accounted for ca. 85 % of variance within the Okataina dataset, and ca. 80 % within the Taupo dataset. Using the first two canonical variates, we correctly classified 5 (Kaharoa, Rotoma, Waiohau, Rotorua, Te Rere) of the Okataina, and 4 (Taupo, Hatepe, Whakaipo, Karapiti) of the Taupo deposits under study, at efficiency levels of 70 – 100 %. The incorporation of a third canonical variate, and additional sompositional data, would further improve our DFA models, which should ideally be used in conjunction with stratigraphic and other characteristic indices, where available, to facilitate accurate correlation. The Mahalanobis distance <b>statistic</b> (<b>D²),</b> a statistical measure of the multidimensional spacing of individual analyses, or groups of analyses, provides a better measure of likeness than the frequently used but subjective similarity coefficients technique...|$|R
