5|$|After World of Motion {{had closed}} on January 2, 1996, <b>everything</b> <b>inside</b> the ride {{building}} was removed. After, new track was constructed {{outside of the}} building which is used as the high-speed test for Test Track. Work inside the building also continued at the same time. It was scheduled to open 29 months after World of Motion's closing, in May 1997, but after numerous problems rose, the ride opening was delayed by nearly 2 years. Also, the cars used on the ride were designed to resemble {{the look of a}} test car that is used to go through multiple safety tests.|$|E
25|$|The first {{scientific}} theories {{indicating that}} {{the age of the}} universe might be finite were the studies of thermodynamics, formalized in the mid-19th century. The concept of entropy dictates that if the universe (or any other closed system) were infinitely old, then <b>everything</b> <b>inside</b> would be at the same temperature, and thus there would be no stars and no life. No scientific explanation for this contradiction was put forth at the time.|$|E
25|$|The French, in turn, {{contracted}} {{with a private}} company for the sale and disposal of the facility for liquidation. Sales were held for clothing, hardware and small tools. Entire buildings were sold to buyers and <b>everything</b> <b>inside</b> it. In the countryside, many farms found themselves with former American buildings being used for various purposes. A group of 200 guards were hired to protect the facility, however many people looted and ransacked the deserted buildings still filled with goods. Fortunes were made {{at the expense of}} the public good.|$|E

25|$|Chance and Vukovich {{meet with}} Masters for the exchange. After {{inspecting}} the counterfeit million, the agents attempt to arrest Masters and Jack, but Jack pulls a shotgun. Jack and Chance fatally shoot each other, and Masters escapes. Vukovich gives chase, {{going to a}} warehouse a previous informant had told them about. By the time he arrives, Masters has set fire to <b>everything</b> <b>inside,</b> destroying all evidence. Vukovich confronts Masters and during a brief struggle, Masters asks Vukovich why {{he did not take}} Grimes' advice to turn his partner in, revealing that Grimes was working on Masters' behalf all along. While Vukovich is stunned at the revelation, Masters grabs a board and knocks him unconscious. Masters then covers Vukovich with shredded paper and is about to set him on fire when Vukovich wakes up and shoots Masters. Masters drops his lighter and accidentally sets himself ablaze, while Vukovich empties his gun on the burning man, killing him.|$|E
25|$|Nomad gets {{trapped and}} decides to {{continue}} into the alien structure. It soon turns into a zero gravity environment. Nomad uses his hydro-thrusters to maneuver and encounters hostile sentient aliens. He also sees a possible invasion force consisting of many alien machines. Nomad manages to escape, but the structure creates a massive sphere of energy that freezes <b>everything</b> <b>inside</b> its structure to -200°F (-129°C). Once outside, Nomad is attacked by various Alien machines before finding Prophet. Prophet was able to engineer a weapon using the aliens' technology, the Molecular Accelerator (MOAC). Prophet's Nanosuit malfunctions, requiring him to frequently stop and recharge using heat sources, such as the burning wrecks of military vehicles. The two leave the ice sphere and rescue Helena, whose VTOL has crashed. Prophet leaves with Helena on another VTOL. At the U.S. evacuation point, {{one of the last}} VTOLs rescues Nomad from an unstoppable quadrupedal alien exosuit. Just as the exosuit is about to destroy the VTOL, Major Strickland draws its attention by firing at it using a mounted machine gun and the exosuit kills Strickland instead. As they leave the island, the pilot is killed and the engines are damaged. Nomad flies the crippled VTOL back to the USS Constitution (CVN-80) Carrier Strike Group while fighting off aliens along the way.|$|E
25|$|The brigade {{consisting}} of around 150 men departed the next day. About {{the same time}} the rear-guard left Swan River with forty men under the command of John Macdonald. While leading his brigade to the Red River Colony, Alexander Macdonell dispatched Cuthbert Grant and 25 Métis to plunder the Hudson’s Bay Company’s Brandon House. On June 1, Grant’s men broke open the gates and stole literally <b>everything</b> <b>inside,</b> even the fort’s grind stone. The stolen goods were divided among the raiders except the furs and ammunition which were claimed by the NWC. On June 16 the Qu’Appelle brigade arrived at Portage la Prairie and encamped. Expecting an attack, their stock of provisions and stolen furs were landed and formed into a defensive square on which two swivel guns were mounted. The next day 2 Métis went to Fort Douglas and warned Governor Semple that a large party was at Portage la Prairies and would attack the colony within 2 days. Semple did not believe the NWC had the strength to accomplish it, but began to keep a 24-hour watch at Fort Douglas. Peguis, chief of the local Swampy Indians offered his services to protect the Red River against the Nor’Westers, but Semple declined. Peguis then encamped with his men along the river opposite the colony. On June 18, the HBC’s Patrick Corcoran, who escaped imprisonment at Fort Qu’Appelle arrived at Fort Douglas and informed Semple that a large NWC and Métis force was gathering there to attack the colony. This was Semple’s second warning. Meanwhile, Cuthbert Grant and a party of Canadians departed Portage des Prairie by canoe followed by a number of Métis on horseback, numbering around 50 men total, to deliver 20 bags of much needed pemmican to Bas de la Rivière. Because of the HBC blockades, the party was forced to land 10 miles from the colony at a place called the “Passage” where they loaded the pemmican onto two carts to take them overland past Fort Douglas and re-embark them at Frog Plain. Part of the force remained to rendezvous with the NWC forces from Fort William and Swan River; around 50 continued towards Frog Plain, but not before being ordered to keep as far away from Fort Douglas and the colony as the terrain would allow to avoid a confrontation. This order was given as there was a swamp about three-quarters of a mile opposite Fort Douglas that left only a narrow plain which allowed passage. Before reaching Fort Douglas, around 24 Métis broke off and rode ahead to set up camp at the Frog Plains. The remaining 26 men continued with the carts. The Métis that were included in this party were covered with paint and wore feathers in their hair as the Indians did; not a typical Métis practice. The paint was supposedly given to them by the Canadians {{in order for them to}} appear more intimidating to the Red River settlers.|$|E

500|$|While {{moving across}} Trinidad, Alma {{produced}} sustained winds of only 35mph (56km/h) at Piarco, yet gusts reached 91mph (147km/h) at Savonetta. Rainfall at Piarco did not exceed 1inch (25mm) during the storm's passage. The strong gusts downed trees and power lines, and damaged about 5,000buildings, including schools, hospitals, {{and hundreds of}} households, wrecking <b>everything</b> <b>inside.</b> This left about 500people homeless. Alma also caused widespread damage to agriculture, mostly to sugar, resulting in [...] of ruined fields. Several highways in the country suffered damage. The winds flung debris from a roof, which struck and killed a woman. There was also an indirect death on the island, along with several injuries. Damage estimates on the island totaled $5million (1974USD); the American embassy in the country considered Alma {{to be the most}} destructive storm in Trinidad during the 20th century.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{spoke with}} Larry King on CNN, {{supporting}} the It Gets Better Project and The Trevor Project, {{a non-profit organization}} providing crisis and suicide prevention for LGBT youth, {{in light of the}} high profile suicides committed in Fall, 2010. She stated: [...] "(I was) one of those kids... holding <b>everything</b> <b>inside...</b> internalizing everything. And that really can affect you, and feeling helpless and hopeless, and finding that person that you can trust, that adult, like I did later on in life, that I felt comfortable and safe to tell my issues, my worries, my pains, my aches to. This is what the Trevor Project is really all about. And they have a 24-hour hotline... There's someone there that you can speak with 24 hours that will be there for you." [...] She made an official It Gets Better video which was released on December 1, 2010.|$|E
500|$|For instance, while {{traveling}} in a moving vehicle at a [...] velocity, {{the laws of}} physics do not change {{as a result of its}} motion. If a person riding within the vehicle throws a ball straight up, that person will observe it rise vertically and fall vertically and not have to apply a force in the direction the vehicle is moving. Another person, observing the moving vehicle pass by, would observe the ball follow a curving parabolic path in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle. It is the inertia of the ball associated with its constant velocity in the direction of the vehicle's motion that ensures the ball continues to move forward even as it is thrown up and falls back down. From the perspective of the person in the car, the vehicle and <b>everything</b> <b>inside</b> of it is at rest: It is the outside world that is moving with a constant speed in the opposite direction of the vehicle. Since there is no experiment that can distinguish whether it is the vehicle that is at rest or the outside world that is at rest, the two situations are considered to be physically indistinguishable. Inertia therefore applies equally well to constant velocity motion as it does to rest.|$|E

2500|$|While outside {{mathematics}} {{the terms}} [...] "sphere" [...] and [...] "ball" [...] are sometimes used interchangeably, in mathematics a distinction is {{made between the}} sphere (a two-dimensional closed surface embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space) and the ball (a three-dimensional shape that includes the sphere as well as <b>everything</b> <b>inside</b> the sphere). This distinction {{has not always been}} maintained and there are mathematical references, especially older ones, that talk about a sphere as a solid.

2500|$|Stuart Craig, the {{production}} {{designer of the}} first five films, stayed on to design all the sets in Half-Blood Prince. Several new sets are introduced, including Tom Riddle's Orphanage, Astronomy Tower and the Cave. Craig noted that the film used several CGI sets, noticeably {{the interior of the}} Cave where Harry and Dumbledore both go to hunt Horcruxes. The exterior of the cave scene was filmed at the Cliffs of Moher in the west of Ireland, the only location to be filmed outside of the United Kingdom throughout the film series. The interior of the cave is made up of geometric crystal formations. Craig noted [...] "Apart from the point at which Harry and Dumbledore first arrive and the island formation on which <b>everything</b> <b>inside</b> the cave happens, the set is entirely virtual, designed in the computer.

2500|$|According to Assaf Sharon of Tel Aviv University, the IDF was {{pressured}} by politicians to unleash unnecessary violence whose basic purpose was 'to satisfy {{a need for}} vengeance,' which the politicians themselves tried to whip up in Israel's population. Asa Kasher wrote that the IDF was pulled into fighting [...] "that is both strategically and morally asymmetric" [...] and that like any other army it made mistakes, but the charges it faces are [...] "grossly unfair". The Israeli NGO Breaking the Silence, reporting on its analysis of 111 testimonies concerning the war by some 70 IDF soldiers and officers, cited one veteran's remark that [...] "Anyone found in an IDF area, which the IDF had occupied, was not a civilian," [...] to argue {{that this was the}} basic rule of engagement. Soldiers were briefed to regard <b>everything</b> <b>inside</b> the Strip as a threat. The report cites several examples of civilians, including women, being shot dead and defined as [...] "terrorists" [...] in later reports. Since leaflets were dropped telling civilians to leave areas to be bombed, soldiers could assume any movement in a bombed area entitled them to shoot. In one case that came under investigation, Lt Col Neria Yeshurun ordered a Palestinian medical centre to be shelled to avenge the killing of one of his officers by a sniper.|$|E
