40|$|The figure {{presents}} a cross-sectional {{view of a}} supercharged, variable-compression, two-cycle, internal-combustion engine that offers significant advantages over prior such engines. The improvements are embodied in a combination of design changes that contribute synergistically to improvements in performance and economy. Although the combination of design changes and the principles underlying them are complex, {{one of the main}} effects of the changes on the overall engine design is reduced (relative to prior two-cycle designs) mechanical complexity, which translates directly to reduced manufacturing cost and increased reliability. Other benefits include increases in the efficiency of both scavenging and supercharging. The improvements retain the simplicity and other advantages of two-cycle engines while affording increases in volumetric efficiency and performance across a wide range of operating conditions that, heretofore have been accessible to four-cycle engines but not to conventionally scavenged two-cycle ones, thereby increasing the range of usefulness of the two-cycle engine into all areas now dominated by the four-cycle engine. The design changes and benefits are too numerous to describe here in detail, but it is possible to summarize the major improvements: Reciprocating <b>Shuttle</b> Inlet <b>Valve</b> The entire reciprocating <b>shuttle</b> inlet <b>valve</b> and its operating gear is constructed as a single member. The <b>shuttle</b> <b>valve</b> is actuated in a lost-motion arrangement in which, at the ends of its stroke, projections on the <b>shuttle</b> <b>valve</b> come to rest against abutments at the ends of grooves in a piston skirt.

5000|$|The basic {{structure}} of a <b>shuttle</b> <b>valve</b> is like a tube with three openings; one on each end, {{and one in the}} middle. A ball or other blocking valve element moves freely within the tube. When pressure from a fluid is exerted through an opening on one end it pushes the ball towards the opposite end. This prevents the fluid from traveling through that opening, but allows it to flow through the middle opening. In this way two different sources can provide pressure without the threat of back flow from one source to the other.|$|R

40|$|Master's thesis in Risk managementDuring well {{drilling}} operation, {{there is a}} possibility of a kick (influx). When a kick is not controlled properly it will become a blow out. This is an uncontrolled and sudden flow of formation fluid that releases from a reservoir through a well bore into surface as a result of pressure difference in formation and well. The kick could flow to surface and create explosions causing fatality, environment damage and loss of asset resulting in high cost. There are procedures and methods to deal with the occurrence of kicks and blowouts in order to control a well flow. Moreover, well barriers should be established and designed based on the characteristics of the reservoir and rock formation. The last line of protection in well barriers is known as Blowout Preventer (BOP). It {{is one of the most}} important barriers to prevent unintentional hydrocarbon release when all well barriers in a well have failed. There are many factors that influence the performance of a BOP. The purpose of this thesis is to determine the criticality of components in BOP related to the redundancies they have during well shut in, stripping, snubbing and BOP testing operation. By knowing the criticality of BOP components, we can assure which components that should be focused on for maintenance and testing. It will also indicate which components that gives redundancy to the BOP during well shut in, stripping, snubbing and BOP testing operation, if one or more components are failed. A literature study is the main work of this thesis. Studying the principal, functions, operations and factors related to drilling activity with respect to the use of BOP. In addition, relevant regulations and standards are also describes to specify the required specification of BOP. The analysis of criticality is done by using risk tools such as reliability block diagram, FMECA, criticality matrix, redundancy and effect table. All of these risk tools complement each other to give the final conclusion of critical component in a BOP. The result of the analysis shows five critical components in a BOP with the prioritization start from <b>shuttle</b> <b>valve</b> (blind shear ram function), blind shear ram (ram piston), flange (BOP stack), gasket (BOP stack) and annular preventer (rubber housing) respectively.

Stripping and snubbing operation also require the critical components to be function properly, but with less critical when well shut in has been done earlier.

40|$|The {{advantages}} and utility of chemical-vapor-deposited (CVD) diamond as an industrial ceramic {{can only be}} realized if the price and quality are right. Until recently, this technology was of interest only to the academic and basic research community. However, interest has grown because of advances made by leading CVD diamond suppliers: 1) Reduction {{of the cost of}} CVD polycrystalline diamond deposition below $ 5 /carat ($ 8 /sq cm); 2) Installation of production capacity; 3) Epitaxial growth of CVD single-crystal diamond. Thus, CVD diamond applications and business are an industrial reality. At present, CVD diamond is produced in the form of coatings or wafers. CVD diamond film technology offers a broader technological potential than do natural and high-pressure synthetic diamonds because size, geometry, and eventually cost will not be as limiting.

40|$|The subsea blowout {{preventer}} (BOP) and the BOP control system {{were the most}} important contributors to the Macondo accident in April 2010. A BOP is a large valve system used during the drilling phase; to seal, control, and monitor oil and gas wells. As a consequence of the Macondo accident, improved methods for reliability assessment of BOPs are now required. Over the years, several subsea BOP reliability studies have been performed, where technical solutions and potential failures are thoroughly investigated. As a result of the information gained, both maintenance and reliability of the BOP systems have improved. Despite overall improvements, the BOP is still a main contributor to risk and downtime in the drilling phase. A deeper look into the reliability reports reveals the control system of the BOP as the root of the majority of failures. Most subsea BOPs are equipped with a multiplex control system with a combination of electronics and hydraulics, used to operate the different functions of the BOP. Despite the high level of redundancy, several sections of the system are subject to critical system failures. To prevent BOP failures, national regulations and standards have been developed in several countries. Most of the national requirements are similar, but there are also differences. These similarities and differences are illustrated in this study through a detailed comparison between the relevant regulations and standards in Norway and the United States, with respect to general-, design- and operational BOP requirements. The main focus of this study is the multiplex subsea BOP control system. The potential critical failures of this system are identified and analyzed in a detailed failure mode, effects, and criticality analysis (FMECA). This analysis shows that the <b>shuttle</b> <b>valve,</b> the pod selector valve, the subsea accumulators, and the fluid reservoir are the most safety-critical parts of the control system. The BOP control system has several redundant elements and these may be vulnerable to common-cause failures. The potential common-cause failures are examined in this study and found to have a significant influence on the reliability of the control system. Improving current reliability assessments of subsea BOP control systems requires a thorough review of both the system and the previously used methods. In this study, a fault tree analysis is performed to reveal the relevant failure combinations. To improve reliability calculations provided by common fault tree analysis programs, a post-processing of the minimal cut sets in a spreadsheet (i. e., Excel) is proposed to cover the effect of common-cause failures. The method gives a more conservative and accurate approximation compared to the existing methods. An event tree analysis is performed to cover the switching phases between the two pods, showing the time dependencies that can influence the consequences. This type of switching cannot be modeled in the fault tree, therefore, recommendations to apply the event tree analysis to similar situations to get a more accurate reliability estimate, is given. For components such as the shear ram, a perfect function test cannot be conducted. In the performed analysis, no such components are evaluated. However, in an expanded analysis of the subsea BOP control system, such components will be involved, therefore, adding the contribution from the proof test coverage factor to components prone to imperfect testing, is recommended...|$|R
40|$|A flow {{visualization}} scheme, {{designed to}} measure vortex fluid dynamics on research aircraft, was validated in flight. Strake vortex trajectories and axial core velocities were determined using pulsed smoke, high-speed video images, and semiautomated image edge detection hardware and software. Smoke was pulsed by using a fast-acting three-way valve. After being redesigned because of repeatedly jamming in flight, the <b>valve</b> <b>shuttle</b> operated flawlessly {{during the last two}} tests. A 25 -percent scale, Gothic strake was used to generate vortex over the wing of a GA- 7 Cougar and was operated at a local angle of attack of 22 degrees and Reynolds number of approximately 7. 8 x 10 (exp 5) /ft. Maximum axial velocities measured in the vortex core were between 1. 75 and 1. 95 times the freestream velocity. Analysis of the pulsed smoke system's affect on forebody vortices indicates that the system may reorient the forebody vortex system; however, blowing momentum coefficients normally used will have no appreciable affect on the leading-edge extension vortex system. It is recommended that a similar pulsed smoke system be installed on the F/A- 18 High Angle Research Vehicle and that this approach be used to analyze vortex core dynamics during the remainder of its high-angle-of-attack research flights...|$|R
40|$|A blowout {{preventer}} (BOP) {{is a large}} valve used to seal, control and monitor oil and gas wells. It serves as an important barrier against blowouts. Excessive downtime on the BOP {{is a problem for}} drilling companies worldwide, which causes increased costs and delays for everyone involved in a drilling project. The background for this thesis is Odfjell Drilling s experience with downtime on the BOP during drilling operations on board their mobile offshore drilling units. The downtime and associated cost due to failure on the BOP increases with the water depth of a drilling project because {{the time it takes to}} recover and re-install the BOP stack increases. In a deepwater operation the unproductive downtime from a problem that requires the BOP stack to be recovered to the surface may be 1 - 2 weeks. The magnitude of the resulting daily loss, both for the owner and the client involved, illustrates how important reliability of the BOP is. Deepwater drilling operations may also experience new challenges compared to operations in more shallow depths. Examples include increased loads on the riser system, higher pressure and temperature in the well and energy loss in subsea accumulators. Today, drilling companies worldwide have a strong focus on reducing BOP downtime. Improved technology and new solutions for subsea BOPs are therefore believed to be a necessity for future deepwater drilling. This thesis is a case study of the electro-hydraulic BOP on board Deepsea Stavanger, a drilling unit owned and managed by Odfjell Drilling. The first focus is to analyse BOP failures that have led to downtime on this rig and to relate them to the technical mode of operation of the BOP. The company Electrical Subsea & Drilling AS (ESD) is working on developing an all-electrically operated BOP. They claim that their new technology can provide many benefits versus the electro-hydraulic BOP systems, both with respect to environmental and operational safety, as well as cost reduction for drilling- and oil companies. Additionally, they claim that their BOP concept is more reliable and less prone to excessive downtime. The second focus is therefore to establish a thorough system description of this concept, to analyse potential failure modes and to compare them with the failures experienced on board Deepsea Stavanger. The overall goal for this thesis is to compare the conventional electro-hydraulic BOP system with the all-electric BOP concept developed by ESD, with respect to reliability. The purpose of such a comparison is to see if any of the recurring failures Odfjell Drilling experiences on board Deepsea Stavanger are less likely to occur if the BOP is all-electrically operated. To compare the two BOP concepts, a reliability analysis is performed on each system. The reliability analyses are performed in four steps: 1. 	Functional analysis 2. 	FMECA 3. 	Reliability block diagram analysis 4. 	Fault tree analysis Reliability data is gathered from experience data on board Deepsea Stavanger, engineering judgment input from a workshop performed with Odfjell Drilling and ESD, previous reliability studies and comparative components in OREDA. The results from the reliability analyses yield that the all-electric BOP concept is more reliable and less prone to failures than existing electro-hydraulic BOP systems. However, this is a result based on a single case study with numerous assumptions involved. There are also other factors, in addition to reliability, that are important to consider when assessing a BOP system. There are many arguments in favour of the all-electric BOP concept. An electric system contains fewer and more reliable components than an electro-hydraulic one, making the all-electric concept simpler than existing BOP systems. The lack of a <b>shuttle</b> <b>valve</b> and the use of subsea batteries instead of accumulators are the most obvious advantages with the all-electric concept. In addition, the concept is weight saving, has a greater amount of redundancy in the control system, offers better and more precise monitoring and is less polluting. Still, there is considerable uncertainty associated with the new technology, both with respect to human impacts, maintenance, repair hours and profitability and there are more issues to be examined before a certain conclusion can be drawn regarding which system contributes the least to BOP downtime. For new technology to be developed and implemented there must exist some market drivers. The fact is that today there are no market drivers for an all-electric BOP system. A promise of high reliability is not enough to create success. An all-electric BOP concept can solve many of the challenges the drilling industry is facing in the years to come, but time will show whether or not the concept proves to be both technically and financially profitable...|$|R

Experience shows that very small cracks or material anomalies do not cause failure {{in a single operation}} event. While the design is being modified to eliminate the issue, NDE has been used to screen the poppets for cracks before every use. Several surface flaw detection techniques were considered and a few NDE techniques were developed to provide NDE screening for the flaw detection. The primary method used was the eddy current testing. In the eddy current technique, the X-Y channel test data from the eddy current instrument was recorded as computer files. A Matlab data review and plotting application was developed to analyze the data files. The Matlab application provides much higher resolution than the eddy current instrument that was used to acquire the data.
