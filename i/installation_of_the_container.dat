40|$|EN] In {{order to}} study the real on-site aging <b>of</b> {{concrete}} and <b>the</b> potential corrosion risk for the reinforcements, Enresa has undertaken a monitoring programme in collaboration with Institute of Construction Science ‘Eduardo Torroja’ (IETcc) by permanently monitoring a pilot nuclear waste <b>container</b> through <b>the</b> <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> sensors. <b>The</b> pilot <b>container</b> <b>of</b> medium and low radioactive waste is buried near the real large concrete cells and has been monitored from 1994. The evolution from 1995 of corrosion parameters (corrosion rate, corrosion potential, electrical resistivity, concrete strains, oxygen availability) obtained is commented in the paper. The {{results indicate that the}} parameters evolve with time and the temperature is a very relevant variable influencing the measurements. An attempt to model <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> temperature has been made by calculating the ‘apparent activation energies’ for <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electrical resistivity. Two clear regimes or slopes were found, one below and the other above 20 °C, which have been attributed to a change in <b>the</b> state <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water from liquid to vapour although it has not been confirmed. The fact is that the resistivity increase is more pronounced above 20 °C than below. Peer reviewe...|$|R
50|$|An {{alternate}} way <b>of</b> conducting <b>the</b> experiment: {{after the}} charged object C is lowered into <b>the</b> <b>container</b> in Procedure 2, <b>the</b> outside surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container</b> is momentarily grounded. The charge on <b>the</b> outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container</b> all drains off to ground, and the charge detector declines to zero, leaving the charge on <b>the</b> inside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container,</b> {{equal but opposite}} to that on C. Then the object C is removed from <b>the</b> <b>container.</b> Since C is no longer present to hold the induced charge on <b>the</b> inside surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container,</b> it migrates to <b>the</b> outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container.</b> so <b>the</b> charge detector registers an equal but opposite charge from its previous reading. This new charge can be proved to be equal and opposite to the charge on C by touching C to <b>the</b> exterior surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container.</b> <b>The</b> two charges exactly neutralize each other, so both <b>the</b> exterior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container</b> and C {{are found to be}} uncharged.|$|R
50|$|The charged object C is touched to <b>the</b> inside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container.</b> <b>The</b> charge {{detector}} reading {{does not}} change. However, if {{the object is}} now withdrawn from <b>the</b> <b>container,</b> <b>the</b> reading stays the same, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>container</b> now has a net charge. If the object is then tested with the charge detector, it {{is found to be}} completely uncharged, and <b>the</b> inside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container</b> is also found to be uncharged. This indicates that all the charge on C has been transferred to <b>the</b> <b>container,</b> and has exactly neutralized the opposite charge on <b>the</b> inside surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container,</b> leaving only <b>the</b> charge on the outside. So the charge on <b>the</b> inside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container</b> was exactly equal to the charge on C.|$|R

5000|$|A metal object C (Faraday used a brass ball {{suspended}} by a nonconductive silk thread, but modern experiments often {{use a small}} metal ball or disk mounted on an insulating handle) is charged with electricity using an electrostatic machine and lowered into <b>the</b> <b>container</b> A [...] without touching it [...] As it is lowered the charge detectors reading increases, indicating that <b>the</b> outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container</b> is becoming charged. Once the object is well inside <b>the</b> lip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container</b> <b>the</b> charge detector levels off and registers a constant charge, even if the object is lowered further. The charge on <b>the</b> outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container</b> is <b>the</b> same polarity as that on the object. If the charge detector is touched to <b>the</b> inside surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container,</b> it {{is found to be}} charged with opposite polarity. For example, if the object C has a positive charge, <b>the</b> outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container</b> A will be found to have a positive charge, while <b>the</b> inside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container</b> has a negative charge.|$|R
5000|$|When {{measuring}} the charge {{on the inside}} or outside surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container,</b> <b>the</b> charge detector should not be touched to the surface near <b>the</b> lip <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>container.</b> Extra charge concentrates near <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opening due to <b>the</b> geometry <b>of</b> <b>the</b> metal.|$|R
