5|$|The {{predominant}} {{sound in}} 1990s country music was pop with only very limited elements of country. This includes {{many of the}} best-selling artists of the 1990s, like Clint Black, Shania Twain, Faith Hill and {{the first of these}} crossover stars, <b>Garth</b> <b>Brooks.</b>|$|E
5|$|He {{has since}} {{worked with the}} likes of The Beach Boys, <b>Garth</b> <b>Brooks,</b> Glen Campbell, Kenny Chesney, Peter Frampton, Vince Gill, Rebecca Lynn Howard, Lane Brody,Julio Iglesias, Alan Jackson, Elton John, Mark Knopfler, Uncle Kracker, Bob Seger, Sting, Steve Winwood, and Trisha Yearwood. He also co- {{produced}} Rosanne Cash's album Interiors, A Glen Campbell Christmas, and the soundtrack for A Thing Called Love.|$|E
5|$|Lavigne's earlier {{influences}} {{came from}} country music acts such as <b>Garth</b> <b>Brooks,</b> the Dixie Chicks and Shania Twain; and alternative singer-songwriters such as Alanis Morissette, Lisa Loeb, Natalie Imbruglia and Janis Joplin. By {{the time she}} left school to focus on her music career, Lavigne was musically more influenced by skate punk, pop punk and punk rock acts such as blink-182, Sum 41, NOFX, Pennywise, Dashboard Confessional, Green Day, the Ramones, the Distillers and Hole. She also enjoyed metal bands such as Marilyn Manson, System of a Down, Incubus and the Used; as well as alternative bands such as Nirvana, No Doubt, the Goo Goo Dolls, Radiohead, Coldplay, Oasis, Third Eye Blind and Matchbox Twenty.|$|E
5|$|Western Swing, {{a musical}} genre with roots in country music, was made popular at Tulsa's Cain's Ballroom. The Tulsa Sound, a {{variation}} of rockabilly, blues, and rock 'n' roll, was started and largely developed by local musicians J. J. Cale and Leon Russell in the 1960s and 1970s. The Tulsa Sound heavily influenced musicians Eric Clapton and Jimmy Markham. Musicians from Tulsa or who started their musical careers in Tulsa include <b>Garth</b> <b>Brooks,</b> The Gap Band, Hanson, Caroline's Spine, Ronnie Dunn, Gene Autry, David Gates, Jamie Oldaker, Jim Keltner, Bob Wills, David Cook, Broncho, Tyson Meade, John Moreland, The Damn Quails, LANY, and JD McPherson. In 2012, Tulsa was ranked as {{having one of the}} best music scenes outside of New York, Los Angeles and Nashville.|$|E
5|$|Although Crash! Boom! Bang! saw chart success (No.1 in Sweden, No.2 in Germany & Australia, No.3 in the UK), it sold fewer copies {{than had}} their {{previous}} albums. EMI America {{were reluctant to}} release the album, and instead promoted a shortened 10-track Favorites CD in association with McDonald's. The Favorites of Crash! Boom! Bang! CD reportedly sold about 1 million copies. It was noted by journalists that the McDonald's promotion CD and other CDs by Tina Turner, <b>Garth</b> <b>Brooks</b> and Elton John, led to US music retailers of the time being unhappy with the promotion on several fronts, including that it bypassed established music stores and {{that the price of}} the CD was way below normal wholesale costs. Some stores refused to sell the albums published by EMI, with one major chain protesting by temporarily pulling all products from CEMA (EMI's distribution wing) out of its sales and ad campaigns. Relations with EMI's North American subsidiary, never on the best of terms, collapsed after the release of this album. Crash! Boom! Bang! became the last Roxette release EMI would issue in the US, until Greatest Hits was released in 2011 on subsidiary label Capitol Records.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} part of the 1960s, however, the Nashville sound had become {{perceived}} as too watered-down by many more traditionalist performers and fans, resulting in a number of local scenes like the Bakersfield sound. A few performers retained popularity, however, such as the long-standing cultural icon Johnny Cash. The Bakersfield sound began in the mid to late 1950s when performers like Wynn Stewart and Buck Owens began using elements of Western swing and rock, such as the breakbeat, in their music. In the 1960s performers like Merle Haggard popularized the sound. In the early 1970s, Haggard was also part of outlaw country, alongside singer-songwriters such as Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. Outlaw country was rock-oriented and lyrically focused on the criminal antics of the performers, in contrast to the clean-cut country singers of the Nashville sound. By the middle of the 1980s, the country music charts were dominated by pop singers, alongside a nascent revival of honky-tonk-style country with the rise of performers like Dwight Yoakam. The 1980s also saw the development of alternative country performers like Uncle Tupelo, who were opposed to the more pop-oriented style of mainstream country. At the beginning of the 2000s, rock-oriented country acts remained among the best-selling performers in the United States, especially <b>Garth</b> <b>Brooks.</b>|$|E

500|$|In late 1990, the Los Angeles Times {{surveyed}} {{country music}} industry insiders {{to determine which}} acts {{could be expected to}} sell the most records over the next seven years. Black placed second in the poll, two votes behind <b>Garth</b> <b>Brooks.</b> [...] The survey results were surprising in that 10 of the top 20 artists named were relative newcomers to the industry; in the past, country music had been dominated by artists with several decades experience. The plethora of new acts confused some reviewers, however. [...] Many reviewers lumped many of the new acts together; as Newsweeks David Gates wrote: [...] "Good song, good voice, hot band: who cares which one it is this time?" [...] Black soon became known as one of Nashville's [...] "hat acts"; like other country artists such as <b>Garth</b> <b>Brooks,</b> Alan Jackson, and Mark Chesnutt, Black was a relative newcomer who wore a hat, and had [...] "clean, neotraditional sound with pop appeal".|$|E
