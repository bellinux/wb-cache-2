40|$|A general {{technique}} is presented for automatic generation of B-spline curves in a spatially constrained environment, subject to specified intrinsic shape properties.

The shape of the curve is governed by constraints based on <b>intrinsic</b> <b>curve</b> properties such as parametric variation and curvature. To simultaneously address the independent goals of global obstacle avoidance and local control of intrinsic shape properties, curve synthesis is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem and solved via simulated annealing. Several example applications are presented which demonstrate the robustness of the technique. The synthesis of both uniform and nonuniform B-spline curves is also demonstrated. An extension of the technique to general sculptured surface model synthesis is briefly described, and a preliminary example of simple surface synthesis presented...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{representation}} of images, called <b>intrinsic</b> <b>curves,</b> that transforms stereo matching from a search problem into a nearest-neighbor problem. <b>Intrinsic</b> <b>curves</b> are the paths that a set of local image descriptors trace as an image scanline is traversed from left to right. <b>Intrinsic</b> <b>curves</b> are ideally invariant with respect to disparity. Stereo correspondence then becomes a trivial lookup problem in the ideal case. We also show how to use <b>intrinsic</b> <b>curves</b> to match real images {{in the presence of}} noise, brightness bias, contrast fluctuations, moderate geometric distortion, image ambiguity, and occlusions. In this case, matching becomes a nearest-neighbor problem, even for very large disparity values...|$|R
40|$|In its {{traditional}} formulation, stereo correspondence involves both searching and selecting. Given a feature in one scanline, the corresponding scanline {{in the other}} image is searched for the positions of similar features. Often more than one candidate is found, and the correct one must be selected. The problem of selection is unavoidable because different features look similar to each other. Search, on the other hand, is not inherent in the correspondence problem. We propose a representation of scanlines, called <b>intrinsic</b> <b>curves,</b> that avoids search over different disparities. The idea is to represent scanlines by means of local descriptor vectors, without regard for where in the image a descriptor is computed, but without losing information about the contiguity of image points. In fact, <b>intrinsic</b> <b>curves</b> are the paths that the descriptor vector traverses as an image scanline is traversed from left to right. Because the path {{in the space of}} descriptors ignores image position, <b>intrinsic</b> <b>curves</b> are invariant with respect to disparity under ideal circumstances. Establishing stereo correspondences is then reduced to the selection of one among few match candidates, a task simplified by the contiguity information carried by <b>intrinsic</b> <b>curves.</b> We analyze <b>intrinsic</b> <b>curves</b> both theoretically and for real images in the presence of noise, brightness bias, contrast fluctuations, and moderate geometric distortion.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{non-parametric}} unsupervised segmentation algorithm based on Region Competition [21]; but implemented within a Level Sets framework [11]. The key novelty of the algorithm {{is that it}} can solve N ≥ 2 class segmentation problems using just one embedded surface; this is achieved by controlling the merging and splitting behaviour of the level sets according to a Minimum Description Length (MDL) [6, 14] cost function. This is in contrast to N class region-based Level Set segmentation methods to date which operate by evolving multiple coupled embedded surfaces in parallel [3, 13, 20]. Furthermore, it operates in an unsupervised manner; it is necessary neither to specify the value of N nor the class models a-priori. We argue that the Level Sets methodology provides a more convenient framework for the implementation of the Region Competition algorithm, which is conventionally implemented using region membership arrays {{due to the lack of}} a <b>intrinsic</b> <b>curve</b> representation. Finally, we generalise the Gaussian region model used in standard Region Competition to the non-parametric case.

40|$|Dense stereo {{matching}} {{is one of}} the fundamental and active areas of photogrammetry. The increasing image resolution of digital cameras as well as the growing interest in unconventional imaging, e. g. unmanned aerial imagery, has exposed stereo image pairs to serious occlusion, noise and matching ambiguity. This has also resulted in an increase in the range of disparity values that should be considered for matching. Therefore, conventional methods of dense matching need to be revised to achieve higher levels of efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, we present an algorithm that uses the concepts of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>curves</b> to propose sparse disparity hypotheses for each pixel. Then, the hypotheses are propagated to adjoining pixels by label-set enlargement based on the proximity in the space of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>curves.</b> The same concepts are applied to model occlusions explicitly via a regularization term in the energy function. Finally, a global optimization stage is performed using belief-propagation to assign one of the disparity hypotheses to each pixel. By searching only through {{a small fraction of the}} whole disparity search space and handling occlusions and ambiguities, the proposed framework could achieve high levels of accuracy and efficiency...|$|R

We calculate the "spinodal" limit of stability for sweeps along the homogeneous <b>intrinsic</b> flow <b>curve.</b> For startup "quenches" into the unstable region, the instability in general occurs before the homogeneous startup flow can attain the <b>intrinsic</b> flow <b>curve.</b> We predict the selected time and length scales at which inhomogeneity first emerges. In the "infinite drag" limit, fluctuations in the mechanical variables (gamma_dot and W) are independent of those in phi, and are unstable when the slope of the <b>intrinsic</b> flow <b>curve</b> is negative; but no length scale is selected. For finite drag, the mechanical instability is enhanced by coupling to phi and a length scale is selected, in qualitative agreement with recent experiments. For systems far from an underlying zero-shear demixing instability this enhancement is slight, while close to demixing the instability sets in at low shear rates and is essentially demixing triggered by flow.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the spirit}} of the variational {{approach}} of Fracture Mechanics initiated in [Del Piero, G., 1997. One-dimensional ductile-brittle transition, yielding and structured deformations. In: P. Argoul, M. Frémond (Eds.), Proceedings of IUTAM Symposium “Variations de domaines et frontières libres en mécanique”, Paris, 1997, Kluwer Academic] and [Francfort, G. A., Marigo, J. -J., 1998. Revisiting brittle fracture as an energy minimization problem. J. Mech. Phys. Solids 46 (8), 1319 – 1342], we deﬁne the loss of stability of the elastic response of the body as the criterion of initiation of cracks. The result is very sensitive to the choice of the surface energy density. On one hand, if we adopt the Grifﬁth assumption, then the elastic state is generally always stable. On the other hand, {{in the case of a}} surface energy of the Barenblatt type, i. e. a surface energy depending non-trivially on the jump of the displacement and inducing cohesive forces, the elastic response remains stable only if the stress ﬁeld does not reach a critical value. In the full three-dimensional context of an isotropic material, we prove that this yield stress criterion is equivalent to a maximal traction criterion and a maximal shear criterion if the surface energy density is Fréchet differentiable at the origin. When the surface energy density is only Gâteaux differentiable, we obtain a yield stress criterion based on an <b>intrinsic</b> <b>curve</b> in the Mohr diagram. In any case, the domain of the admissible stress tensors is convex, unbounded in the direction of the hydrostatic pressures and depends only on the extreme eigenvalues of the stress tensor...|$|E
40|$|Failure of masonry panels under {{in-plane}} loading {{can be attributed}} to three simple modes: slipping of mortar joints, cracking of clay bricks and splitting of mortar joints, and middle plane spalling. In this paper a suitable strength criterion is connected to each collapse mode. In more detail, a frictional law is associated with the slipping, which accounts for the shear strength depending nonlinearly on normal stress (modified Mohr-Coulomb criterion of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>curve).</b> Splitting can be expected by the maximum tensile strain criterion (Saint Venant), orthotropic nonsymmetric elasticity being assumed for the material. Eventually panels exhibit spalling when the maximum compressive stress (Navier criterion) is attained under biaxial loading. Strength parameters are then identified on the basis of experimental results and a comparison with the reliable criteria found in the literature is carried out. The validity of the proposed failure criteria to predict the experimental failure modes in a nondimensional stress space, normalized with respect to the normal stress, has been tested in a qualitative manner for the three fundamental failure modes. A quantitative comparison between experimental and analytical results has been carried out for the cases where significant scatters are concerned. The proposed failure criteria seem to be in good agreement with experimental results, within the limits of: small-size panels, single withes, solid units, regular mortar joints, and in-plane loads. Further, these criteria can be used together with a suitable two-dimensional finite-element model, and then directly used to carry out the limit analysis of masonry walls, modeled by a discrete number of panels of finite size. The potential application of the proposed criteria to actual cases is also illustrated. In fact, a specific example is worked out to show how to apply these criteria to predict the failure load and failure mode of a particular masonry panel...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{is aimed}} at {{deriving}} assessment and design formulae for determining the elastic–plastic response and the ultimate compressive strength of circular concrete columns confined by Fiber Reinforced Polymers (FRP). To achieve this, a constructive method for obtaining closed-form elastic and post-elastic solutions for Functionally Graded Material Cylinders (FGMCs), constituted by an isotropic central core and an arbitrary cylindrically orthotropic hollow phases, is proposed. In {{the first part of}} the paper, under the hypotheses of axis-symmetrical boundary conditions, elasticity and perfect bond between the phases, new analytical solutions for self-equilibrated axial forces applied at the extremities of the object are derived. In particular, the rather general mathematical approach has been based on a strategy already proposed by some of the authors in a previous work, and here extended to anisotropic hollow phases. The key of the involved method is to reduce the differential Boundary Value Problem (BVP) to the equivalent linear algebraic one, by means of a special matrix-like arrangement of the governing equations and invoking the Complex Potential Theory for anisotropic materials. The obtained general solution has been then easily particularized to the two phase FGMC representing the circular concrete column confined by FRP sheets. In the second part of the paper, the above mentioned solutions for the concrete column are "moved" within the post-elastic range and we investigate the evolution of the stress field in the solid components when the concrete core is characterized by an <b>Intrinsic</b> <b>Curve</b> or Schleicher-like elastic–plastic behavior endowed with associate flow rule, and the FRP cylindrically orthotropic hollow phases obey to an elastic–brittle Tsai–Hill anisotropic yield criterion. At the end, the elastic and post-elastic response of the overall solid and predictive formulae for estimating the failure mechanism, in terms of concrete ultimate compressive strength, confining pressure and strain at failure, are derived. The obtained results are finally compared with several experimental literature data, highlighting the very good agreement between the analytical predictions and experimental tests...|$|E

First we calculate the ``spinodal'' onset of instability in sweeps along the <b>intrinsic</b> constitutive <b>curve.</b> For startup ``quenches'' into the unstable region, the instability usually occurs before the <b>intrinsic</b> constitutive <b>curve</b> can be attained so we analyse the fluctuations with respect to the homogeneous startup flow to find the selected length and time scales at which inhomogeneity first emerges.

When coupled to concentration, this instability is enhanced at short length scales; a length scale is selected, as seen experimentally. The unstable region is then broadened. Far from an underlying (zero-shear) demixing instability, the broadening is slight and the instability is still dominated by shear rate and micellar strain. Close to demixing, instability sets in at very low shear rate, where it is demixing triggered by flow. Comment: 20 pages, 12 figure...|$|R

The observed light curves of SN 2005 ip all exhibit a sudden drop around 50 days after discovery. This {{has been attributed to}} dust formation in the dense circumstellar medium. We modeled the <b>intrinsic</b> light <b>curves</b> in six optical bands, adopting a theoretical model for the luminosity evolution of supernovae interacting with their circumstellar material. From the difference between the observed and <b>intrinsic</b> light <b>curves,</b> we calculated extinction curves as a function of time. The total-to-selective extinction ratio, $R_V$, was determined from the extinction in the B and V bands. The resulting extinction, $A_V$, increases monotonically up to about 1 mag, 150 days after discovery. The inferred $R_V$ value also increases slightly with time, but appears constant in the range 4. 5 [...] 8, beyond 100 days after discovery. The analysis confirms that dust is likely formed in SN 2005 ip, starting about two months after explosion. The high value of $R_V$, that is, gray dust, suggests dust properties different from of the Milky Way. While this result hinges on the assumed theoretical <b>intrinsic</b> light <b>curve</b> evolution, it is encouraging that the fitted light curves are as expected for standard ejecta and circumstellar medium density structures.

40|$|In modern {{engineering}} applications, multilayered {{structures are}} extensively used {{due to the}} added advantage of combining physical, mechanical, and thermal properties of different materials. Many of these applications require a detailed knowledge of transient temperature and heat-flux distribution within the component layers. Both analytical and numerical techniques {{may be used to}} solve such problems. Nonetheless, numerical solutions are preferred and prevalent in practice, due to either unavailability or higher mathematical complexity of the corresponding exact solutions. Rather limited use of analytical solutions should not diminish their merit over numerical ones; since exact solutions, if available, provide an insight into the governing physics of the problem, which is typically missing in any numerical solution. Moreover, analyzing closed-form solutions to obtain optimal design options for any particular application of interest is relatively simpler. In addition, exact solutions find their applications in validating and comparing various numerical algorithms to help improve computational efficiency of computer codes that currently rely on numerical techniques. Although multilayer heat conduction problems have been studied in great detail and various solution methods including orthogonal and quasi-orthogonal expansion technique, Laplace transform method, Green’s function approach, finite integral transform technique are readily available; there is a continued need to develop and explore novel methods to solve problems for which exact solutions still do not exist. One such problem is to determine exact unsteady temperature distribution in polar coordinates with multiple layers in the radial direction. Numerous applications involving multilayer cylindrical geometry require evaluation of temperature distribution in complete disk-type. One typical example is a nuclear fuel rod, which consists of concentric layers of different materials and often subjected to asymmetric boundary conditions. Moreover, several other applications including multilayer insulation materials, double heat-flux conductimeter, typical laser absorption calorimetry experiments, cryogenic systems, and other cylindrical building structures would benefit from such analytical solutions. Then, object of the present thesis is to derive new thermo-elastic solutions for composite materials constituted by multilayered spheres and cylinders under time-dependent boundary conditions. These solutions are utilized for several engineering applications and we report some applications in last analyze chapters of present thesis. In follows, we will described the contents of thesis. In first chapters are reported the thermo-mechanical foundations and a summary of the formulation of thermo-elastic problems for isotropic material. In chapter X it is developed an analytical approach to find exact elastic solutions for multilayered cylinder composed of isotropic constituents and determining the analytical response in terms of displacements and stresses for all the De Saint Venant (DSV) load conditions, that is axial force, torque, pure bending and combined bending moment and shear actions. Successively, {{on the basis of the}} found analytical solutions, a homogenization procedure is adopted in order to obtain the overall constitutive elastic laws for multilayered cylinder, in this way deriving the exact one-dimensional model characterized by the axial stiffness, flexural rigidity, shear deformability and torsional stiffness relating beam’s generalized stresses and strains. By playing with the Poisson ratios of adjacent phases, some counterintuitive and engineering relevant results are shown with reference to unexpected increasing of overall stiffness of multilayered cylinder. In chapter XI it is presented an analytical elastic solution for multilayered cylinder constituted by transversally-isotropic n-phases, under radial pressure, axial force and torque. Then, by utilizing the homogenization theory, it is obtained the overall elastic stiffness of the equivalent homogeneous transversally-isotropic solid, establishing the constitutive elastic laws relating stresses and strains. In chapter XII it is developed an analytical approach to find exact elastic solutions for multilayered cylinder subjected to axial force, constituted by n orthotropic cylindrical hollow phases and a central core, each of them modelled as homogeneous and cylindrically anisotropic material. In chapter XIII it is reported an analytical solution for multilayered cylinder composed by hollow cylindrical monoclinic phases under axial force and torsion. In this chapter, we consider the chiral structure for each cylindrical layer. In particular the composite material is constituted by two hollow cylindrical monoclinic phases. The cylindrical monoclinic elastic property of multilayered cylinder is obtained by the particular chiral structure. In fact, we consider the two hollow phases constructed by right-handed and left-handed spiral helices whose long axes are all parallel. These helical spirals may be either touching or separated by a matrix material and are composed by elastic orthotropic material. In chapters XIV, XV, XVI are reported some thermo-elastic solution, for hollow cylinders, hollow spheres and plates, respectively. In chapter XVII we consider a steady-state thermo-elastic problem of multilayered cylinder with finite length. The thermal and mechanical loads applied on the cylinder are axisymmetric in the hoop direction and are constant in the axial direction. In order to obtain analytical solutions for temperature, displacements, and stresses for the two-dimensional thermo-elastic problem, the cylinder is assumed to be composed of n fictitious layers in the radial direction. The material properties of each layer are assumed as homogeneous. In chapter XVIII are determined the displacements, strains, and stresses from the general analytical solution of multilayered sphere composed by an arbitrary number of layers constituted by materials with generic modulus of elasticity, thermal expansion coefficient and thermal conductivity. Material properties are assumed to be temperature-independent and homogeneous in each layer. The multilayered sphere is considered as a classical composite material whose properties abruptly vary from one hollow sphere to the other. In chapter XIX are presented the most important standard fire curves: ISO 834, External fire curve, hydrocarbon fire curve, ASM 119 and parametric fire curves (European Parametric fire curves, Swedish Fire Curves, BFD curves, CE 534 curve). Moreover in this chapter are reported the mechanical and thermal properties of steel and concrete at elevate temperature. In chapters XX and XXI, the one-dimensional quasi-static uncoupled thermo-elastic problem of a multilayered sphere and multilayered cylinder, with time-dependent boundary conditions are considered, respectively. The body forces and heat generation vanish. In both cases, the analytical solution is obtained by applying the method of separation of variables. In chapter XXII it is studied a spherical tank methane gas-filled exposed to fire characterized by hydrocarbon fire curve. The interaction between spherical tank and internal gas is studied. By applying a suitable simplified hypothesis on the mechanics of problem, we determine the analytical thermo-elastic solution for spherical tank. By applying the solution obtained, the increasing graded temperature of gas methane in spherical tank is determined. Finally, a numerical example is reported for a spherical tank exposed to hydrocarbon fire, showing the collapse temperature. In chapter XXIII, an industrial insulated pipeline is modelled as multilayered cylinder, subjected to mechanical and thermal loads. By using a multi-layered approach based on the theory of laminated composites, the solutions for temperature, heat flux, displacements, and thermal/mechanical stresses are presented. By applying the analytical thermo-elastic solution reported in Chapter XVII, a parametric analysis is conducted in order to analyze the mechanical behaviour of an industrial insulated pipeline composed by three phases: steel, insulate coating, and outer layer made of polyethylene to protect the insulation. In this model, parametric analyses are conducted by varying the Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, thermal conductivity and linear thermal expansion coefficient of insulate coating. The analysis shows the maximum Hencky von Mises’s equivalent stress in steel phase and in insulate coating. Finally, it is presented a numerical example by considering three types of materials for insulate coating: (1) Expanded Polyurethane; (2) Laminate glass; (3) Syntatic foam. In chapter XXIV it is analyzed a cylindrical concrete specimen under axial force within Fibre Polymeric Reinforcing sheets. The elastic solutions found in Chapter XII are here extended to the post-elastic range. The evolution of the stress field when the core phase is characterized by an <b>Intrinsic</b> <b>Curve</b> or Schleicher-like elastic-plastic response with associate flow rule and the cylindrically orthotropic hollow phase obeys to is shown the elastic-brittle Tsai-Hill anisotropic yield criterion. The choice of these post-elastic behaviours is suggested by experimental evidences reported in literature for these materials, as well as the cylindrical orthotropy of the hollow phase intrinsically yields to consider several perfectly bonded FRP layers as an equivalent one, interpreting their overall mechanical response by invoking the theory of homogenization and the mechanics of composites. At the end, a numerical example application to cylindrical concrete specimens reinforced with Carbon FRP is presented, by furnishing a predictive formula – derived from the previously obtained analytical solutions - for estimating the overall collapse mechanism, the concrete ultimate compressive strength and the confining pressure effect. The results are finally compared with several experimental literature data, highlighting the very good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the laboratory measurements. In chapter XXV it is reported an analytical thermo-elastic solution in closed form for bi-layer hollow cylinder subjected to time-dependent boundary conditions. It is assumed that each hollow cylinder is composed by a homogeneous and thermo-isotropic material, characterized by different mechanical and thermal parameters, i. e. modulus of elasticity, thermal expansion coefficient and thermal conductivity. Moreover, these material properties in each hollow cylinder are assumed to be temperature-independent. In other words, the bi-layer hollow cylinder is considered as a classical composite material whose properties abruptly vary from one hollow cylinder to the other. In particular, it is obtained a new analytical solution for a bi-layer hollow cylinder, constituted by two phases: Ceramic () and Metal () subjected to heat flux on inner surface...|$|E

40|$|Motivated {{by recent}} light {{scattering}} experiments on semidilute wormlike micelles, we study {{the early stages}} of the shear banding instability using the nonlocal Johnson-Segalman model with a "two-fluid" coupling of flow to micellar concentration. We perform a linear stability analysis for coupled fluctuations in shear rate gamma, micellar strain (W) double under bar, and concentration phi about an initially homogeneous state. This resembles the Cahn-Hilliard (CH) analysis of fluid-fluid demixing (although we discuss important differences). First, assuming the initial state to lie on the <b>intrinsic</b> constitutive <b>curve,</b> we calculate the "spinodal" onset of instability in sweeps along this curve. We then consider start-up "quenches" into the unstable region. Here the instability in general occurs before the <b>intrinsic</b> constitutive <b>curve</b> can be attained, so we analyze the fluctuations with respect to the time-dependent start-up flow. We calculate the selected length and time scales at which inhomogeneity first emerges. When the coupling between flow and concentration is switched off, fluctuations in the "mechanical variables" gamma and (W) double under bar are independent of those in phi, and are unstable when the <b>intrinsic</b> constitutive <b>curve</b> has negative slope; but no length scale is selected. Coupling to the concentration enhances this instability at short length scales, thereby selecting a length scale, consistent with the recent light scattering experiments. The spinodal region is then broadened by an extent that increases with proximity to an underlying (zero-shear) CH fluid-fluid (phi) demixing instability. Far from demixing, the broadening is slight and the instability is still mechanically dominated (by delta(gamma) over dot and delta(W) double under bar) with only small deltaphi. Close to demixing, instability sets in at a very low shear rate, where it is dominated instead by deltaphi. In this way, the model captures a smooth crossover from shear banding instabilities that are perturbed by concentration coupling to demixing instabilities that are induced by shear...|$|R

The bias voltage corresponds {{to an average}} electric field in the negative differential conductivity region of the <b>intrinsic</b> current-field <b>curve</b> of the SL, a condition that generally implies space charge instability. Key structural parameters associated with both the shunt layer and SL are identified for which the shunt layer stabilizes a uniform electric field profile.

40|$|Abstract. The group {{generated}} by the Weierstrass points of a smooth curve in its Jacobian is an intrinsic invariant of the curve. We determine this group for all smooth quartics with eight hyperflexes or more. Since Weierstrass points {{are closely related to}} moduli spaces of curves, as an application, we get bounds on both the rank and the torsion part of this group for a generic quartic having a fixed number of hyperflexes in the moduli space M 3 of curves of genus 3. The Weierstrass points of an algebraic curve, which can be defined over some extension of the base field, form a distinguished set of points of the curve having the property of being geometrically <b>intrinsic.</b> <b>Curves</b> of genus 0 or 1 have no Weierstrass points, and for hyperelliptic curves, the Weierstrass points can easily be characterized as the ramification points under the hyperelliptic involution, which generate the 2 -torsion subgroup of the Jacobian. For nonhyperelliptic curves of genus 3, which admit a plane quartic model, the structure of the Weierstrass subgroup, i. e., the subgroup of the Jacobian {{generated by}} the images of the Weierstrass points under the Abel-Jacobi map, cannot be characterized so easily. This structure is known for curves with many automorphisms ([10], [12], [13]), in which cases the groups are finite. As with Weierstrass points, the Weierstrass subgroup is a geometric invariant of the curve, which we study in this paper. More precisely, we determine the structure of this group for all curves having either eight (Theorems 4. 1 and 5. 1) or nine hyperflexes (Theorem 3. 1), i. e., points at which the tangent line to the curve meets the curve with multiplicity four. These are the first nontrivial cases of interest since there are no curves with either ten or eleven hyperflexes, and the two possible cases of curves with twelve hyperflexes have already been treated ([7], [13]). We show: Theorem 3. 1. Let Ω 1 be the plane quarti...|$|R

A generalized resolved-rate technique for solving hyper-redundant manipulator inverse kinematics using a backbone curve is introduced. This method is applicable even in cases when explicit representation of the backbone <b>curve</b> <b>intrinsic</b> geometry cannot be written in closed form. Problems of end-effector trajectory tracking which were previously intractable can now be handled with this technique. Examples include configurations generated using the calculus of variations.

40|$|We {{revisit the}} anomaly of {{rotation}} {{curve in the}} nearly face-on galaxy M 51 that shows an apparently faster decrease of rotation velocity than the Keplerian law in the outer disk, further showing apparent counter rotation in the outermost HI disk. We interpret this anomaly as due to warping of the galactic disk, and determined the warping structure of M 51 's disk using the tilted-ring method, assuming that the <b>intrinsic</b> rotation <b>curve</b> is normal. It is shown that the disk is nearly flat in the inner disk at a constant inclination angle, but the disk suddenly bends at radius 7. 5 kpc by about 27. The inclination angle, then, decreases monotonically outward reaching a perfect face-on ring at 18 kpc, beyond which the disk is warped in the opposite sense to the inner disk, resulting in apparent counter rotation.

40|$|An {{approach}} {{to the construction of}} the CNOT quantum logic gate for a 4 -dimensional coupled-qubit model with weak but otherwise arbitrary coupling has been given recently [M. R. Geller et al., Phys. Rev. A, 012320 (2010) ]. How does the resulting fidelity depend on the form of qubit-qubit coupling? In this paper we calculate <b>intrinsic</b> fidelity <b>curves</b> (fidelity in the absence of decoherence versus total gate time) for a variety of qubit-qubit interactions, including the commonly occurring isotropic Heisenberg and XY models, as well as randomly generated ones. For interactions not too close to that of the Ising model, we find that the fidelity curves do not significantly depend on the form of the interaction, and we calculate the resulting interaction-averaged fidelity curve for the non-Ising-like cases and a criterion for determining its applicability.
