The reported strength of the army of 152,000 infantry and 24,400 cavalry is impossibly large.

25|$|Though Crosby {{did want}} {{more time to}} tend to his other {{business}} and leisure activities, he also sought better quality through recording, including being able to eliminate mistakes and control the timing of his show performances. Because his own Bing Crosby Enterprises produced the show, he could purchase the latest and best sound equipment and arrange the microphones his way; the logistics of microphone placement had long been a hotly debated issue in every recording studio {{since the beginning of}} the electrical era. No longer would <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wear the hated toupee on his head previously required by CBS and NBC for his live audience shows (he preferred a hat).

500|$|By 1990, Moffat {{had written}} two series of Press Gang, but the programme's high cost along with {{organisational}} changes at backers Central Independent Television cast its future in doubt. As Moffat wondered {{what to do}} next and worried about his future employment, Bob Spiers, Press Gangs primary director, suggested that he meet with producer Andre Ptaszynski to discuss writing a sitcom. Inspired by his experience working in education, Moffat's initial proposal was a programme similar to what would become Chalk, a sitcom set in a school that eventually aired in 1997. During the pitch meeting at the Groucho Club, Ptaszynski realised that Moffat was talking passionately about his impending divorce and suggested that he write about that instead of a school sitcom. Taking Ptaszynski's advice, Moffat's new idea was about [...] "a sitcom writer whose wife leaves him". Moffat wrote two series of Joking Apart, which was directed by Bob Spiers, and starred Robert Bathurst and Fiona Gillies. The show won the Bronze Rose of Montreux and was entered for the Emmys. In an interview with Richard Herring, Moffat says that [...] "The sit-com actually lasted slightly longer than my marriage." [...] Fiona Gillies, who played the adulteress Becky, says that she was aware that some of her dialogue was based on what had been said to Moffat during his own separation. Moffat recycled his own dialogue: when he had learned that his wife's lover was a fan of Press Gang, he replied, [...] "Well, did <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fuck my wife? Most people just write in!". The line, with the expletive replaced by [...] "shagged", was used in the first episode of Joking Apart.|$|E

500|$|The regency {{council of}} the infant King Henry VI was {{inclined}} to have James released as soon as possible. In {{the early months of}} 1423 their attempts to resolve the issue met with little response from the Scots, clearly influenced by the Albany Stewarts and adherents. Archibald, Earl of Douglas was an astute and adaptable power in Southern Scotland whose influence even eclipsed that of the Albany Stewarts. [...] Despite his complicity in James's brother's death in Albany's castle in 1402 Douglas was still able to engage with the king. [...] From 1421, Douglas had been in regular contact with James and they formed an alliance that was to prove pivotal in 1423. Although Douglas was the pre-eminent Scottish magnate his position in the borders and Lothians was jeopardised—not only did <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> forcibly retake Edinburgh Castle from his own designated warden but was very likely under threat from the Earls of Angus and March. In return for James's endorsement of Douglas's position in the kingdom, the earl was able to deliver his affinity in the cause of the king's home-coming. Also, the relationship between Murdoch—now Duke of Albany following his father's death in 1420—and his own appointee Bishop William Lauder seemed to be under strain perhaps evidence of an influential grouping at odds with Murdoch's stance. Pressure from these advocates for the king almost certainly compelled Murdoch to agree to a general council in August 1423 when it was agreed that a mission should be sent to England to negotiate James's release. James's relationship with the House of Lancaster changed in February 1423 when he married Joan Beaufort, a cousin of Henry VI and the niece of Thomas Beaufort, 1st Duke of Exeter, and Henry, Bishop of Winchester. A ransom treaty of £40,000 sterling (less a dowry remittance of 10,000 marks) was agreed at Durham on 28 March 1424 to which James attached his own seal. The king and queen escorted by English and Scottish nobles reached Melrose Abbey on 5 April and were met by Albany who relinquished his governor's seal of office.|$|E

[...] Former fast-bowler Michael Holding argued [...] "if the batsman can change from being right-handed to left-handed, there shouldn't be a problem with a bowler changing from being right-handed to left-handed, either, without having to tell the umpire, nor should <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> tell the umpire if he is going over or round the wicket." ...|$|E
