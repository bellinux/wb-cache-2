5|$|Delayed <b>gratification,</b> or {{deferred}} <b>gratification,</b> is {{the ability}} to resist the temptation for an immediate reward and wait for a later reward. Generally, delayed <b>gratification</b> is associated with resisting a smaller but more immediate reward in order to receive a larger or more enduring reward later. A growing body of literature has linked the ability to delay <b>gratification</b> to a host of other positive outcomes, including academic success, physical health, psychological health, and social competence.|$|E
5|$|Externalizing {{disorders}} (i.e., acting-out disorders) show {{a clearer}} link to delayed <b>gratification,</b> since they more directly involve deficits in impulse control. For example, {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) and aggressive behavior are associated with difficulty delaying <b>gratification</b> in children and adolescents, as are substance abuse, gambling, and other addictive behaviors in adolescents and adults. In a 2010 study, teenagers and young adults with stronger abilities to delay <b>gratification</b> were less likely to drink alcohol, or to smoke cigarettes or cannabis. Interestingly, a 2011 study found that the contrast in delayed <b>gratification</b> between children with and without ADHD was no longer significant after statistically controlling for IQ (in other words, ADHD was not associated with delayed <b>gratification</b> above and beyond the influence of IQ). This may stem from the high correlation between intelligence and delayed <b>gratification,</b> and suggests that the tie between delayed <b>gratification</b> and ADHD could benefit from more investigation.|$|E
5|$|Behavior theorists see delaying <b>gratification</b> as an {{adaptive}} skill. It {{has been shown}} that learning to delay <b>gratification</b> promotes positive social behavior, such as sharing and positive peer interactions. For example, students who learn to delay <b>gratification</b> are better able to complete their assigned activities. To put it simply, if someone undertakes an activity with the promise of a delayed reward after, the task's completion becomes more likely.|$|E

5|$|Delayed <b>gratification</b> or {{deferred}} <b>gratification</b> is {{an animal}} behavior {{that can be}} linked to delay discounting, ecological factors, individual fitness, and neurobiological mechanisms. Research for this behavior has been conducted with animals such as capuchin monkeys, tamarins, marmosets, rats, and pigeons.|$|E
5|$|Difficulty delaying <b>gratification</b> {{also plays}} a role in internalizing {{disorders}} like anxiety and depression. A hallmark behavior in anxiety is avoidance of feared or anxiety-provoking situations. By seeking the immediate relief that comes with avoidance, a person is succumbing to the pull of instant <b>gratification</b> over the larger reward from overcoming the fear and anxiety that caused the avoidance. Procrastination, which is often a reflection of anxiety, is a clear example: a person avoids a dreaded task by engaging in a more enjoyable immediate activity instead. Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a more jarring case of this anxiety-related struggle to delay gratification; someone with OCD is unable to resist compulsions that temporarily mitigate the torture of obsessive thoughts, even though these compulsions do not banish the obsessions in the long run. One experiment, however, did not find any significant differences between samples with OCD and healthy controls in delayed <b>gratification,</b> while finding substantially improved delayed <b>gratification</b> among those with obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. Depression is also associated with lower capacity to delay <b>gratification,</b> though the direction of cause and effect is not clear. A depressed person who has difficulty pushing him or herself to engage in previously enjoyed activities is (deliberately or not) prioritizing short-term comfort and is demonstrating an impaired ability to delay <b>gratification.</b> There is evidence that individuals who engage in deliberate self-harm (i.e., cut themselves) are less able to tolerate emotional distress but are more able to tolerate physical pain. Thus it is argued that they injure themselves because they cannot delay <b>gratification</b> and need a way to end emotional pain quickly.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} {{that there is a}} strong genetic {{component}} to deferred <b>gratification,</b> though no direct link has been established. Since many complex genetic interactions are necessary for neurons to perform the simplest tasks, it is hard to isolate one gene to study this behavior. For this same reason, multiple genes are likely responsible for deferred <b>gratification.</b> Further research is necessary to discover the genetic corollaries to delayed <b>gratification.</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} relationship between Internet use and <b>gratifications</b> gained {{within the context of}} the digital divide framework. Analyses within sub-samples defined by age and socio-economic status reveal that there are notable differences in uses and <b>gratifications</b> across subgroups. For instance, those who are young and high in socioeconomic status are most likely to use the Internet to satisfy their motivations strategically and to gain the desired <b>gratifications.</b> They are most likely to engage in specific Internet behaviors—computer-mediated interaction, surveillance, and consumption uses— to achieve the particular <b>gratifications</b> of connection, learning, and acquisition. In contrast, those who are young and low in socio-economic status were more likely to employ consumptive use of the Internet to attain connection <b>gratifications.</b> Similarly, regardless of age, both low socioeconomic status subgroups were likely to use computer-mediated interaction as a means to gain learning <b>gratifications.</b> Even as gaps in access are closing, gaps in usage and <b>gratifications</b> gained seem to persist...|$|R
40|$|A USES AND GRATIFICATIONS APPROACH The {{uses and}} <b>gratifications</b> {{approach}} places {{power in the}} hands of the audience and is a helpful perspective when trying to understand media usage, exposure, and effects. However, while the uses and <b>gratifications</b> approach has been applied regularly to traditional media, research explaining why people use new social media networks as well as the <b>gratifications</b> they obtain from them is scarce at best. This thesis provides a comprehensive overview of the uses and <b>gratifications</b> approach as well as the current literature about social media networks. An argument is built within the thesis to study Twitter as one social media network through the uses and <b>gratifications</b> theoretical lens. Research questions are provided and a survey of 216 college undergraduates was conducted. Results show that people use a variety of Twitter functions, that the <b>gratifications</b> sought from Twitter are not the <b>gratifications</b> obtained from Twitter, and that people are careful about the types of information they share on the social media network. Additionally, results suggest that Twitter users obtain more <b>gratifications</b> from the passive functions of Twitter rather the active functions in terms of relationa...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe use of {{entertainment}} media is often {{assumed to be}} motivated by individuals’ desire to experience emotions. Entertainment audiences want experiences that make them laugh or cry, or keep them {{at the edge of}} their seats. But why exactly do individuals seek emotional media experiences, and what types of <b>gratifications</b> do they obtain from such experiences? An overview of research on emotional <b>gratifications</b> shows that emotions can be gratifying on different levels ranging from simple hedonistic <b>gratifications</b> to more complex <b>gratifications</b> such as the satisfaction of social and cognitive needs. An integrative framework is outlined that aims at a more systematic understanding of emotional <b>gratifications,</b> and their influence on media use...|$|R
5|$|At birth, infants {{are unable}} to wait for their wants {{and needs to be}} met and exhibit a {{defining}} lack of impulse control. With age, developing children are able to retain impulsivity but also gain control over their immediate desires and are increasingly able to prolong <b>gratification.</b> Developmental psychologists study the progression of impulse control and delay of <b>gratification</b> over the lifespan, including deficiencies in development that are closely related to attention deficits and behavior problems.|$|E
5|$|Behaviorists {{focus on}} the {{acquisition}} and teaching of delayed <b>gratification,</b> and have developed therapeutic techniques for increasing ability to delay. Behavior analysts capitalize on the effective principles of reinforcement when shaping behavior by making rewards contingent on the person's current behavior, which promotes learning a delay of <b>gratification.</b> It {{is important to note}} that for a behavior modification regimen to succeed, the reward must have some value to the participant. Without a reward that is meaningful, providing delayed or immediate <b>gratification</b> serves little purpose, as the reward is not a strong reinforcer of the desired behavior.|$|E
5|$|Each {{of these}} {{positive}} outcomes requires some ability to forgo short-term reward {{in favor of}} a higher payoff in the future. The ability to delay <b>gratification</b> also appears to be a buffer against rejection sensitivity (the tendency to be anxious when anticipating interpersonal rejection). In a 20-year follow-up of the marshmallow experiment, individuals with vulnerability to high rejection sensitivity who had shown strong delay of <b>gratification</b> abilities as preschoolers had higher self-esteem and self-worth and more adaptive coping skills, in comparison to the individuals who had high rejection sensitivity but low delay of <b>gratification</b> as four-year-olds. These compelling longitudinal findings converge with other studies showing a similar pattern: The ability to resist temptation early in life translates to persistent benefits across settings.|$|E

5|$|Factors {{affecting}} one's {{ability to}} delay <b>gratification</b> {{depend on whether}} the delay contingency is self-imposed (delay can be terminated at {{the will of the}} person waiting) or externally imposed by another person, institution or circumstance. When the contingency is self-imposed, the physical presence of the reward seems to aid in delaying <b>gratification.</b> On the other hand, when the delay is externally imposed, children are not able to wait as long when the reward is present, suggesting greater frustration under these circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{theory can}} argue against the {{selection}} of the deferred <b>gratification</b> trait since there are both costs and risks associated with delaying <b>gratification</b> behavior. One such cost is the basic opportunity cost associated with time spent waiting. While waiting, individuals lose time {{that could be used to}} find other food. Seeking high calorie food conveys a clear evolutionary advantage. There are also two risks associated with being patient. First, there is a risk that another animal might get to the food first, also known as an interruption risk. Second, there is the risk that the chance to get the reward will be cut short, perhaps by a predator, also known as a termination risk. These costs and risks create situations in which the fitness of the individual is threatened. There are several examples that show how reward delay occurs in the real world. For example, animals that eat fruit have the option of eating unripe fruit right away, or waiting, delaying <b>gratification,</b> until it becomes ripe. The interruption risk plays a part here, because if the individual forgoes the unripe fruit, there is a chance that another individual may come along and get to it first. Also, in extractive foraging, such as with nuts and shellfish, the outer shell creates a delay. However, animals that can store food and defer eating are more likely to survive during harsh conditions, and thus delaying <b>gratification</b> may also incur an evolutionary advantage.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the <b>gratifications</b> {{business}} graduates seek when engaging with employer brands on the Social Networking Sites (SNSs) LinkedIn and Facebook. Research Design – The study is anchored in the Uses and <b>Gratifications</b> (U&G) approach, commonly applied for research on antecedents to engagement through different media. First, a pre-study was carried out in order to validate previously identified <b>gratifications</b> sought from the U&G approach and find potential additional <b>gratifications</b> in the context of employer brands. The main study was an online survey of business graduates studying their final semester, resulting in 122 usable responses from job-seeking business graduates in Sweden. The data was analyzed using multiple regression techniques. Findings –Previous U&G studies contributed with three <b>gratifications</b> sought from engagement in terms of Information, Entertainment and Integration & Social Interaction. The pre-study led to the findings of two additional <b>gratifications</b> relevant for the study’s context of employer brands, namely Strategy and Convenience. All <b>gratifications</b> except Entertainment were tested and recognized as reliable constructs representing the <b>gratifications</b> sought to predict Engagement with Employer brands, although different combinations of the <b>gratifications</b> were seen for LinkedIn and Facebook respectively. Integration & Social Interaction and Strategy predict business graduates’ engagement with employer brands on LinkedIn, whereas Information and Strategy explained engagement on Facebook. Theoretical & Practical Implications – The findings have implications for future research on engagement on social media and the integration of social media into employer branding. Furthermore, the present research contributes with two additional <b>gratifications</b> sought from engagement on social media: Strategy and Convenience. Practically, the findings give ideas about how firms can utilize SNSs as platforms in their employer branding initiatives to encourage engagement from potential employees, as long as they pay attention to the differences in structure and atmosphere characterized by different SNSs.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} uses and <b>gratifications</b> of {{different}} stakeholders regarding marketing communication messaging {{and how these}} uses and <b>gratifications</b> vary according to stakeholder loyalty. Marketing is increasingly recognising {{that in order to}} be effective, firms need to consider a broader range of stakeholders other than just consumers. However, current literature fails to identify how firms should interact with their various stakeholder groups and only identifies that such interactions should take place. In developing an understanding of how to interact with various stakeholder groups, the uses and <b>gratifications</b> approach was adopted and stakeholders were positioned on the extended ladder of stakeholder loyalty. The analysis of data emerging from a qualitative survey among 28 stakeholders of Philips Design demonstrates that the revealed uses and <b>gratifications</b> of various stakeholder groups regarding marketing communication messaging have much in common with classifications derived from studies of other mass media uses and <b>gratifications.</b> A wide range of uses and <b>gratifications</b> with regard to marketing communication messaging was revealed varying according to stakeholder loyalty. Based on their specific uses and <b>gratifications</b> the various stakeholder groups have different content preferences regarding marketing communication messaging.

5|$|The {{duration}} of time until an eventual reward also affects participants' choice of immediate or delayed <b>gratification.</b> A 2001 study demonstrated {{that if a}} reward will not be granted for an extensive amount of time, such as 180–300 months (15–25 years), the monetary amount of the reward is inconsequential; instead, {{the bulk of the}} participants choose the immediate reward, even if their delayed reward would be quite large.

5|$|The more {{positive}} emotions and behavior that a 12- to 24-month-old toddler displays when coping with separation from a parent, the better s/he is 3.5 years later at using cooling strategies {{in order to}} delay <b>gratification.</b> This suggests that the emotional skills and processes required for coping with social and interpersonal frustrations {{are similar to those}} utilized for coping with the aggravation of goal-directed delay of <b>gratification.</b> Maternal attachment also influences the development of a child's ability to delay <b>gratification.</b> An interaction has been found between a mother's level of control and how close a child stays to the mother while exploring the environment. Children who have controlling mothers and explore their environment at a far distance from her are able to employ more cooling strategies and delay rewards longer. Similarly, children who stay close to a non-controlling mothers also use more cool strategies and demonstrate longer delays. This suggests that some children of controlling mothers have better learned how to distract themselves from or effectively avoid intrusive stimuli, although additional effects on their emotional competency are speculated but unknown. A greater capacity to delay <b>gratification</b> by using effective attentional strategies is also seen in preschoolers whose mothers had been responsive and supportive during particularly stressful times of self-regulation when the child was a toddler, indicating that maternal responsiveness during highly demanding times is crucial for the development of self-regulation, self-control and emotional competency.|$|E

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2016. Includes bibliographical references. Despite its {{theoretical}} relevance, {{the notion}} of social media affordances has not permeated social media uses and <b>gratifications</b> studies. This {{has resulted in a}} need for research that focuses on developing affordance-based measures and testing them across user populations. Recognizing this need, Sundar (2008) and Sundar and Limperos (2013) suggested an affordance-based conceptual framework, known as the MAIN model, which can help develop potential measures of new media uses and <b>gratifications.</b> This study used the MAIN framework to develop an affordance-based scale for social media uses and <b>gratifications</b> and used it to characterize political actors, particularly dissidents and allegiants, and individuals with different levels of political tolerance and dogmatism. The first phase of the study focused on developing the social media uses and <b>gratifications</b> scale, using a convenience sample of 393 university students. The results of the first phase supported the conceptual accuracy of the MAIN model, indicating that conceptualizing social media uses and <b>gratifications</b> as a second-order factor structure that classifies social media uses and <b>gratifications</b> constructs into four different types of affordances (Modality, Agency, Interactivity, and Navigability) does not jeopardize the statistical validity of measures. The scale developed in the first phase was applied in the second phase to examine social media uses and <b>gratifications</b> that can characterize political actor types and levels of political dogmatism and tolerance. A sample of 313 American citizens above the age of 18, collected through a professional data collection service, was used to test five discriminant models to achieve this goal. The first three discriminant models showed that social media uses and <b>gratifications</b> can be used to classify political actor types with nearly 70 % accuracy. However, the results painted a nuanced picture, indicating that social media uses and <b>gratifications</b> can describe differences as well as similarities between potential political dissidents and allegiants. While Realism, Coolness, and Agency-enhancement <b>gratifications</b> were common among dissidents and allegiants, dissidents showed significantly lower Filtering than allegiants. The fourth and fifth discriminant models also had more than 70 % classification accuracy. According the last two models, uses and <b>gratifications,</b> such as Realism and Play, can characterize dogmatism, and Coolness, Filtering, and Browsing can indicate high political tolerance. The contribution of this dissertation research is two-fold. First, it suggests a potential affordance-based social media uses and <b>gratifications</b> scale {{that can be used in}} future research. Second, it suggests that, as opposed to the utopian perspective that social media are ideal platforms for alternative politics, they can cater to individuals engaged in both anti- and pro-system politics as well as politically dogmatic users...|$|R
5|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} suggests that self-control is akin to a muscle that can be strengthened through practice. In other words, self-control abilities are malleable, a fact that can be a source of hope for those who struggle with this skill. In psychotherapy, treatment for impulse-control issues often involves teaching individuals to realize the downsides of acting on immediate urges and in turn to practice delaying <b>gratification.</b> In anxiety disorders, this process occurs through exposure to a feared situation – which is very uncomfortable at first, but eventually becomes tolerable and even trains a person's mind and body that these situations are less threatening than originally feared. Exposure therapy is only effective if an individual can delay <b>gratification</b> and resist the urge to escape the situation early on. To shed insight on the tradeoff between short- and long-term gains, therapists might also help individuals construct a pro-con list of a certain behavior, with sections for short-term and long-term outcomes. For maladaptive coping behaviors such as self-injury, substance use or avoidance, there are generally no long-term pros. Meanwhile, abstinence from acting on a harmful urge (i.e., delayed <b>gratification)</b> generally results in long-term benefits. This realization can be a powerful impetus for change.|$|E
5|$|Behavioral {{researchers}} have found that a choice for instant versus delayed <b>gratification</b> is influenced by several factors including whether the reward is negative or positive reinforcement. A past study by Solnick et al., focused on an experiment where the main concentrations were time added to both conditions and the preference of the participants with experiencing a loud noise for variable amounts of time: 15, 30, 60, and 90 seconds. The buttons to turn off the noise were manipulated by one button turning off the noise for {{a short amount of time}} and the other turning the noise off for an extended time. The participants were found to be more willing to turn off the noise immediately for 90 seconds rather than turning it off for the 120 seconds after a 60-second delay was issued. Findings illustrate that participants chose not to delay their <b>gratification</b> for the relief of noise but rather instantly silence it for a shorter amount of time.|$|E
5|$|In a 2011 study, {{researchers}} {{tested to}} see if people would willingly choose between instant and delayed <b>gratification</b> by offering them a set amount of (hypothetical) money that they could receive presently, or telling them they could wait a month for more money. Results suggested that willingness to delay <b>gratification</b> depended {{on the amount of}} money being offered, but also showed wide individual variation in the threshold of later reward that was motivating enough to forgo the immediate reward. The subjective value of a reward can also stem from the way one describes the potential reward. As prospect theory states, people are heavily loss-averse. People tend to value a commodity more when it is considered to be something that can be lost or given up than when it is evaluated as a potential gain.|$|E
