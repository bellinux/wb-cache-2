Faysal left Iraq again on 2 September 1933, seeking a cooler climate in London, where he died five days later.|$|E

The initial investigation stated that he committed suicide by jumping out of the window, although some believe that he was murdered by the ascendant Communists. A 2004 police investigation into his death concluded that, contrary to the initial ruling, he did not commit suicide, but was defenestrated, most likely by Czechoslovak Communists and their Soviet NKVD advisers for opposing the February 1948 Communist putsch.|$|E

500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on November 25, 1910. The film had a wide national release, known advertising theaters include those in Nebraska, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Indiana, Montana, and Oklahoma, The New York Dramatic Mirror was neutral to slightly praising the production. The reviewer stated, [...] "It is a discursive narrative, not bound by laws of cause and effect, although it does not contradict them. It is amusing to see the rapidity with which a motion picture hero goes West. He throws a toothbrush and <b>his</b> <b>pajamas</b> into a suitcase, takes his hat over his arm, and breaks the news to his father before stepping {{from the living room}} out into the street. The special point of this film is the aviation exhibition, which is well handled. The hero is a very jocose gentleman, who smiles broadly with and without provocation. Other parts are adequately filled." [...] The Moving Picture World spared three roughly three sentences surrounding the focus of the plot, [...] "A love story built up around the invention of a new type of aeroplane. The machine flies and the inventor gets the girl of his choice. The picture has, therefore, a pleasant ending." ...|$|E

50|$|The Khaki pant {{has been}} around since 1846 when Englishman Sir Henry Lumsden dyed <b>his</b> cotton <b>pajamas</b> to create a uniform more {{suitable}} to the climate of India, thus creating khakis.

2500|$|Falasca {{noted the}} 2009 {{testimony}} of Sister Margherita Marin (b. 1941), {{who was one}} of the two nuns that found the pope dead in his bedroom on the morning of 29 September.

Sister Vincenza had noted the pope had not touched the coffee she had left for him in the sacristy at 5:15am (after about ten minutes) and went looking for him but found him dead, and hastily summoned Marin who also went into the room. Marin testified that Luciani's hands were cold, and she was struck by the darkness of his nails. Sister Vincenza said: [...] "He hasn't come out yet? Why not? and knocked a few more times but heard silence, then opening the door and walking in. Marin remained in the hallway but heard the elder sister say: [...] "Your Holiness, you shouldn't pull these jokes on me" [...] because Sister Vincenza also had heart problems. Marin further testified that original information provided by the Vatican regarding who discovered the pope was wrong, since it had originally been claimed the pope's secretaries Lorenzi and Magee did. Marin testified that [...] "he was in bed with a slight smile" [...] on his face. The reading light over the headboard was still on, with his two pillows under his back propping him up, with his legs outstretched and his arms on top of the bedsheets. Luciani was still in <b>his</b> <b>pajamas</b> with a few typewritten sheets in his hands.

Because of his immense popularity among the public and military ranks, Gürsel was subsequently chosen by the revolutionaries overnight and brought into the chairmanship of the military coup and became, [...] the only leader in the world put into power by a military takeover who had previously had no role in its planning or execution.
