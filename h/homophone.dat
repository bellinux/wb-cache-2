25|$|One {{man who has}} {{encountered}} this problem is Taiwanese politician Yu Shyi-kun, due to the rarity of the last character in his name. Newspapers have dealt with this problem in varying ways, including using software to combine two existing, similar characters, including {{a picture of the}} personality, or, especially {{as is the case with}} Yu Shyi-kun, simply substituting a <b>homophone</b> for the rare character in the hope that the reader would be able to make the correct inference. Taiwanese political posters, movie posters etc. will often add the bopomofo phonetic symbols next to such a character. Japanese newspapers may render such names and words in katakana instead of kanji, and it is accepted practice for people to write names for which they are unsure of the correct kanji in katakana instead.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to compare lexical decision latencies in visual and auditory modalities to three word types: (a) words that are inconsistent with two information sources, orthography and semantics (i. e., heterographic <b>homophones</b> such as bite/byte), (b) words that are inconsistent with one information source, semantics (i. e., homographic <b>homophones</b> such as bat), and (c) control words that are not inconsistent with any information source. Participants (N = 76) were randomly assigned to either the visual or auditory condition in which they judged the lexical status (word or nonword) of 180 words (60 heterographic <b>homophones,</b> 60 homographic <b>homophones,</b> and 60 control words) and 180 pronounceable nonsense word foils. Results differed significantly in the visual and auditory modalities. In visual lexical decision, homographic <b>homophones</b> were responded to faster than heterographic <b>homophones</b> or control words, which did not differ significantly. In auditory lexical decision, both homographic <b>homophones</b> and heterographic <b>homophones</b> were responded to faster than control words. Results are used to propose potential modifications to the Cooperative Division of Labor Model of Word Recognition (Harm & Seidenberg, 2004) to enable it to encompass both the visual and auditory modalities and account for the present results...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the evolution of}} <b>homophones</b> {{and its relation to}} the evolution of syllable number of words, based on the quantitative analysis on the historical data and simulation. We suggest that <b>homophones</b> are the outcome of arranging form-meaning associations according to Zipf’s law to maximize the referential power under effort for the speaker constraints. We also discuss the neural bases of ambiguity and the relation between ambiguity and robustness in language evolution. Furthermore, we show that <b>homophones</b> are stable and cumulate with the times. To avoid creating <b>homophones,</b> syllable number of words increases, with more recent entry dates of words associated with more syllables. We also explore stability of <b>homophones</b> and instability of synonyms in children’s acquisition process. The mechanism of the evolution of <b>homophones</b> and syllable length of words works cross-linguistically from the emergence of language and goes on at present...|$|R

At the Barcelona Open and Estoril Open, he lost in early rounds and then was eliminated from the Madrid Masters {{in the second round}} by Stan Wawrinka and from the Rome Masters in the first round by John Isner. At the Geneva Open, Sousa won a first round match over his Brazilian <b>homophone</b> João Souza, which was notable for the umpire needing to refer to each player by their nationality to distinguish between them during the calls. Sousa proceeded to the final, his first of the season, where he lost to Thomaz Bellucci. At the French Open, Sousa beat Canadian Vasek Pospisil in straight sets in the first round, and was defeated by 3rd seed Andy Murray in the second round. In the men's doubles of the tournament, Sousa partnered with Bellucci and was knocked out in the first round by 11th seeds Jamie Murray and John Peers. In June, Sousa did not have a strong grass court season; he was defeated in the early rounds at the Rosmalen Grass Court Championships, the Queen's Club Championships and the Nottingham Open. At Wimbledon, Sousa was again eliminated in straight sets in the first round by French Open champion and 4th seed Stan Wawrinka. His results did not improve in the men's doubles competition, from which he was eliminated in the first round while partnering with Santiago Giraldo.|$|E

Two additional protagonists were designed as Thongs' partners in crime, {{with the intention of}} increasing the comedic value of the film through their interactions. The film's Chinese title is Bo Bui Gai Wak (Cantonese: 寶貝計劃, literally Project BB, with [...] "BB" [...] being a <b>homophone</b> for [...] "Baby"), a reference to Chan's award winning 1983 film Project A (Cantonese: A Gai Wak, A計劃).|$|E

5000|$|Two (or more) {{differently}} spelt {{words with}} different meanings are <b>homophones</b> {{if they are}} nonetheless pronounced the same; e.g., right, rite, wright, and write; read (most tenses of verb) and reed; read (past, past participle) and red. This list includes only a few <b>homophones</b> although incorrect use of <b>homophones</b> is a very common error; the following words from the list are all good English words, though often incorrectly used in place of their homophones: advice, affect, artic (colloquial UK usage for [...] "articulated lorry"), aweful, breath, calender, capital, dose, its, lightening, loose, loosing, planing, principal, rime, solider, stoping, they're, wether and you're.

500|$|Alternatively, politically-conservative {{commentator}} Rush Limbaugh {{alleged that}} the film was biased against 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney due to Bane's name being a <b>homophone</b> for Bain Capital, the financial service company Romney used to head, {{despite the fact that}} the character has existed as a major Batman foe since 1993. In response, Nolan said that the comments were [...] "bizarre", while Dixon and Freeman said that the comments were [...] "ridiculous". Democratic adviser Christopher Lehane has noted the similarities between the narratives of the film and the presidential campaign.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the {{adoption}} of Nihon, other terms such as [...] and [...] were used. The term [...] is a <b>homophone</b> of Wo 倭 (pronounced [...] "Wa" [...] by the Japanese), which has been used by the Chinese as a designation for the Japanese as early as the third century Three Kingdoms period. However, the Japanese disliked some connotation of Wa 倭 (which has been associated in China with concepts like [...] "dwarf" [...] or [...] "pygmy"), and it was therefore replaced with the substitute character , meaning [...] "togetherness, harmony".|$|E

40|$|Semantic map is {{a complex}} network of words or phrases which are related in some way. To search related words or phrases for a given English word from a large {{vocabulary}} of English language is a time consuming process for a computer. Each time to search related set of words or phrases requires massive processing of comparison and if the entire database is large enough it is required to implement some mechanism that makes searching efficient and fully utilizing the computing power. The words and phrases which are related may be synonyms, antonyms or <b>homophones</b> meaning having similar pronunciation with different spellings and different meanings. The researcher has {{made an effort to}} prepare such a network of <b>homophones</b> so that when a search for <b>homophones</b> is required for a given English word, the fast retrieval of result in form of set of <b>homophones</b> can be possible. To determine about the words whether they are <b>homophones</b> or not we require phonetic algorithms for phonetic similarity between words. Similar to indexing a mechanism is derived using an algorithm that is one time processing to prepare a semantic map and then to retrieve set of <b>homophones</b> from this semantic map of <b>homophones.</b> This one time processing for constructing a semantic map is also somehow time consuming processing but once it is constructed searching becomes more efficient...|$|R

In Japanese, Houei Nojiri suggested the translation , {{and this was}} borrowed into Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese (which instead uses [...] "Sao Diêm Vương", which {{was derived from the}} Chinese term 閻王 (Yánwáng), as [...] "minh" [...] is a <b>homophone</b> for the Sino-Vietnamese words for [...] "dark" [...] (冥) and [...] "bright" [...] (明)). Some Indian languages use the name Pluto, but others, such as Hindi, use the name of Yama, the God of Death in Hindu and Buddhist mythology. Polynesian languages also tend to use the indigenous god of the underworld, as in Maori Whiro.|$|E

[...] However, major Russian broadcasters rejected the ad due to concerns over its possible insinuation that the Whopper was better than drugs, as red poppies {{are in the same}} plant family as the source of heroin. The company refused to comment of the veracity of the networks' claims, and instead posted the advertisement on its YouTube channel, eventually pulling it from that service as well.|$|E
500|$|Several {{competing}} linguistic {{theories have}} been put forth. Some scholars argue that her name may {{be a combination of}} the Greek sus ("pig") and korax ("crow"). Another rough translation produces the phrase [...] "the Scythian raven", an etymological description of Medea (Batman upon Bartholome, a work which Shakespeare is likely to have used for reference, gives the name Corax for a raven) Also, psychorrhax ("heartbreaker"), may be a play on the Greek word psychoraggia ("death struggle"). One critic searched for a connection to Sycorax's North African heritage, and found a parallel in Shokereth שוקרת, a Hebrew word meaning [...] "deceiver". Another recent idea suggests that, for thematic as well as historical reasons, the name is the reverberant combination of syllables in the name Corax of Syracuse – the oft acknowledged founder of rhetoric and worthy, fictionalised rival of Prospero. An especially odd and early guess at a meaning by one critic was sic or rex, a Latin <b>homophone</b> alluding to Queen Elizabeth's pride.|$|E
5000|$|Characters of the keisei monji (...) group each {{contain a}} {{semantic}} part and a phonetic part. The choice {{was made to}} swap the phonetic parts with <b>homophones</b> which had fewer strokes. For example, [...] was changed to , because [...] and [...] were <b>homophones.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Including more terms {{means that}} fewer {{have to be}} spelled out in kana --- which is {{the whole point of}} using a code. Further, the {{reduction}} in duplication allows more flexibility in assigning <b>homophones.</b> Instead of ten groups for each letter, word, or phrase, each could receive <b>homophones</b> based on its frequency of occurrence. For example, the cryptographer can assign an appropriately large number of <b>homophones</b> to high-frequency letters and words like [...] "n," [...] "shi," [...] and [...] "owari" [...] and only one or two code groups to lower frequency elements.|$|R
40|$|In {{a series}} of experiments, the authors {{investigated}} whether naming latencies for <b>homophones</b> (e. g., /nAn/) are a function of specific-word frequency (i. e., the frequency of nun) or a function of cumulative-homophone frequency (i. e., {{the sum of the}} frequencies of nun and none). Specific-word but not cumulative-homophone frequency affected picture-naming latencies. This result was obtained in 2 languages (English and Chinese). An analogous finding was obtained in a translation task, where bilingual speakers produced the English names of visually presented Spanish words. Control experiments ruled out that these results are an artifact of orthographic or articulatory factors, or of visual recognition. The results argue against the hypothesis that <b>homophones</b> share a common word-form representation, and support instead a model in which <b>homophones</b> have fully independent representations. <b>Homophones</b> are words that have the same pronunciation but differ in meaning, spelling, or grammatical class. How are homo-phones represented and accessed in speech production? Two hy-potheses have been proposed. One view holds that <b>homophones</b> share a common lexical-phonological representation, but because they have different meanings and often also different grammatica...|$|R
500|$|During {{his time}} with TSR, Gygax had often {{mentioned}} the mysterious Castle Greyhawk which formed the centre of his own home campaign. But despite all of his written output over the previous 30 years, Gygax had never published details of the castle. In 2003, Gygax {{announced that he was}} again partnering with Rob Kuntz to publish the original and previously unpublished details of Castle Greyhawk and the City of Greyhawk in 6 volumes, although the project would use the rules for Castles and Crusades rather than D. As Gygax wrote in an on-line forum: [...] "I have laid out a new schematic of castle and dungeon levels based on both my original design of 13 levels plus side adjuncts, and the 'New Greyhawk Castle' that resulted when Rob and I combined our efforts and added a lot of new levels too. From that Rob will draft the level plans for the newest version of the work. Meantime, I am collecting all the most salient feature, encounters, tricks, traps, etc. for inclusion on the various levels. So the end result will be what is essentially the best of our old work in a coherent presentation usable by all DMs, the material having all the known and yet to be discussed features of the original work that are outstanding... I hope." [...] Since Wizards of the Coast, which had bought TSR in 1997, still owned the rights to the name [...] "Greyhawk", Gygax changed the name of Castle Greyhawk to [...] "Castle Zagyg", a reverse <b>homophone</b> of his own name, and also changed the name of the nearby city to [...] "Yggsburgh", a play on his initials [...] "E.G.G." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another type of wordplay used in cryptics {{is the use}} of homophones. For example, {{the clue}} [...] "A few, we hear, add up (3)" [...] is the clue for SUM. The {{straight}} definition is [...] "add up", meaning [...] "totalize". The solver must guess that [...] "we hear" [...] indicates a <b>homophone,</b> and so a <b>homophone</b> of a synonym of [...] "A few" [...] ("some") is the answer. Other words relating to sound or hearing can be used to signal the presence of a <b>homophone</b> clue (e.g., [...] "aloud", [...] "audibly", [...] "in conversation", etc.).|$|E
2500|$|The auspiciousness {{of these}} objects can be {{attributed}} to a variety of factors. In Edo era Japan, hawks were considered [...] "natural emblems of the Japanese warrior class due to their keen eyesight, their predatory nature, and their boldness." [...] The <b>homophone</b> 高 (taka) means 'great' or 'high.' The eggplant has long been considered to have associations with fertility, and is also a <b>homophone</b> for 成す (nasu), [...] "to accomplish; to achieve; to succeed in." [...] 'Fuji' (富士), when written with the <b>homophone</b> kanji characters 不 (fu - not/ un-) and 死 (ji - death), can be interpreted to mean 'immortality.' When taken as a group, the combination of the syllables fuji, taka, nasu can also be read as homophones for [...] "unparalleled success." ...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} with the Stroop paradigm {{were conducted to}} investigate the role of phonological codes in access {{to the meaning of}} Chinese characters. Subjects named the ink color of viewed characters or color patches. Key items were color characters, their <b>homophones</b> with the same tone, <b>homophones</b> with different tones, and semantic associates. Apart from finding the usual Stroop interference effect, <b>homophones</b> produced significant interference in the incongruent condition, provided that they had the same tone as the color characters. The interference effect from <b>homophones,</b> however, was significantly smaller than that from color characters. Semantic associates generated an interference effect in the incongruent condition, an effect of the same magnitude as the effect from the same-tone <b>homophones.</b> Finally, in the congruent conditions, all the key items yielded facilitations compared to neutral controls, though the facilitation from color characters was larger than the facilitations from other types of characters. These findings suggest that phonological codes in Chinese are activated obligatorily and provide early sources of constraint in access to meaning. 2000 Elsevier Science B. V.
