5000|$|On 3 May 2013, a Fairchild AFB, WA {{air crew}} flying a McConnell AFB, KS (USAF) KC-135R, 63-8877, crashed about 8 minutes after {{taking off from}} Manas Airbase in Kyrgyzstan, killing three crew members. The {{aircraft}} was at cruise altitude about 200 km west of Bishkek when it lost altitude and crashed in a mountainous area {{near the village of}} Chorgolu, close to the border between Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan. Videotape evidence seems to indicate that the fuselage was in flames as it descended from the clouds overhead, although the tail and some wreckage (left wing, vertical stabilizer, one <b>engine,</b> <b>boom</b> and boom drogue adapter) were not blackened by fire and landed some distance away. This may indicate an inflight explosion or structural failure, possibly related to thunderstorms in the area. [...] Ultimately, the mishap board determined that a rudder system malfunction contributed to development of oscillatory instability, known as [...] "Dutch roll." [...] The inexperienced aircrew did not adequately diagnose the problem and, by using rudder to maintain course, contributed to structural failure of the aircraft. Although one of the last -135 aircraft built, this airframe was 48 years and 10 months old {{at the time of its}} loss.|$|E

40|$|Today, a {{high noise}} level is {{considered}} a problem in many working environments. The main reason is that it contributes to stress and fatigue. Traditional methods using passive noise control is only practicable for high frequencies. As a complement to passive noise control, active noise control (ANC) {{can be used to}} reduce low frequency noise. The main idea of ANC is to use destructive interference of waves to cancel disturbing noises. The purpose of this thesis is to design and implement an ANC system in the driver's cabin of a Valmet 890 forest machine. The <b>engine</b> <b>boom</b> {{is one of the most}} disturbing noises and therefore the main subjective for the ANC system to suppress. The ANC system is implemented on a Texas Instrument DSP development starter kit. Different FxLMS algorithms are evaluated with feedback and feedforward configurations. The results indicate that an ANC system significantly reduces the sound pressure level (SPL) in the cabin. Best performance of the evaluated systems is achieved for the feedforward FxLMS system. For a commonly used engine speed of 1500 rpm, the SPL is reduced with 17 dB. The results show fast enough convergence and global suppression of low frequency noise...|$|E
