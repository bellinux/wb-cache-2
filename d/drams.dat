40|$|Putting the <b>DRAM</b> on {{the same}} package with a {{processor}} enables several times higher memory bandwidth than conventional off-package <b>DRAM.</b> Yet, the latency of in-package <b>DRAM</b> is not appreciably {{lower than that of}} off-package <b>DRAM.</b> A promising use of in-package <b>DRAM</b> is as a large cache. Unfortunately, most previous <b>DRAM</b> cache designs mainly optimize for hit latency and do not consider off-chip bandwidth efficiency as a first-class design constraint. Hence, as we show in this paper, these designs are suboptimal for use with in-package <b>DRAM.</b> We propose a new <b>DRAM</b> cache design, Banshee, that optimizes for both in- and off-package <b>DRAM</b> bandwidth efficiency without degrading access latency. The key ideas are to eliminate the in-package <b>DRAM</b> bandwidth overheads due to costly tag accesses through virtual memory mechanism and to incorporate a bandwidth-aware frequency-based replacement policy that is biased to reduce unnecessary traffic to off-package <b>DRAM.</b> Our extensive evaluation shows that Banshee provides significant performance improvement and traffic reduction over state-of-the-art latency-optimized <b>DRAM</b> cache designs.

40|$|In modern systems, DRAM-based {{main memory}} is {{significantly}} {{slower than the}} processor. Consequently, processors spend a long time waiting to access data from main memory, making the long main memory access latency {{one of the most}} critical bottlenecks to achieving high system performance. Unfortunately, the latency of <b>DRAM</b> has remained almost constant in the past decade. This is mainly because <b>DRAM</b> has been optimized for cost-per-bit, rather than access latency. As a result, <b>DRAM</b> latency is not reducing with technology scaling, and continues to be an important performance bottleneck in modern and future systems. This dissertation seeks to achieve low latency DRAM-based memory systems at low cost in three major directions. First, based on the observation that long bitlines in <b>DRAM</b> are one of the dominant sources of <b>DRAM</b> latency, we propose a new <b>DRAM</b> architecture, Tiered-Latency <b>DRAM</b> (TL-DRAM), which divides the long bitline into two shorter segments using an isolation transistor, allowing one segment to be accessed with reduced latency. Second, we propose a fine-grained <b>DRAM</b> latency reduction mechanism, Adaptive-Latency <b>DRAM,</b> which optimizes <b>DRAM</b> latency for the common operating conditions for individual <b>DRAM</b> module. Third, we propose a new technique, Architectural-Variation-Aware <b>DRAM</b> (AVA-DRAM), which reduces <b>DRAM</b> latency at low cost, by profiling and identifying only the inherently slower regions in <b>DRAM</b> to dynamically determine the lowest latency <b>DRAM</b> can operate at without causing failures. This dissertation provides a detailed analysis of <b>DRAM</b> latency by using both circuit-level simulation with a detailed <b>DRAM</b> model and FPGA-based profiling of real <b>DRAM</b> modules. Our latency analysis shows that our low latency <b>DRAM</b> mechanisms enable significant latency reductions, leading to large improvement in both system performance and energy efficiency.

40|$|Autophagy is a membrane-trafficking {{process that}} serves to deliver cytoplasmic {{proteins}} and organelles to the lysosome for degradation. The process is genetically defined {{and many of}} the factors involved are conserved from yeast to man. Recently, a number of new autophagy regulators have been defined, including the Damage-Regulated Autophagy Modulator (<b>DRAM),</b> which is a lysosomal protein that links autophagy and the tumor suppressor, p 53. We describe here analysis of DRAM-related proteins which reveals evolutionary conservation and divergence of <b>DRAM's</b> role in autophagy. We report that humans have 5 other proteins that show significant homology to <b>DRAM.</b> The closest of these, which we have termed <b>DRAM</b> 2, displays 45 % identity and 67 % conservation when compared to <b>DRAM.</b> Interestingly, although similar to <b>DRAM</b> in terms of homology, <b>DRAM</b> 2 is different from <b>DRAM</b> as it not induced by p 53 or p 73. <b>DRAM</b> 2 is also a lysosomal protein, but again unlike <b>DRAM</b> its overexpression does not modulate autophagy. In contrast to humans, the Drosophila genome only encodes one DRAM-like protein, which is approximately equal in similarity to human <b>DRAM</b> and <b>DRAM</b> 2. This questions, therefore, whether <b>DRAM</b> function is conserved from fly to man or whether <b>DRAM's</b> capacity to regulate autophagy has evolved in higher eukaryotes. Expression of DmDRAM, however, clearly revealed an ability to modulate autophagy. This points, therefore, to a conserved role of <b>DRAM</b> in this process and that additional human proteins have more recently evolved which, while potentially sharing some similarities with <b>DRAM,</b> may not be as intrinsically connected to autophagy regulation...|$|R

2500|$|Synchronous {{dynamic random-access memory}} (SDRAM) is any dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) {{where the}} {{operation}} of its external pin interface is coordinated by an externally supplied clock signal. DRAM integrated circuits (ICs) produced from the early 1970s to mid-1990s used an asynchronous interface, in which input control signals have a direct effect on internal functions only delayed by the trip across its semiconductor pathways. SDRAM has a synchronous interface, whereby changes on control inputs are recognised after a rising edge of its clock input. [...] In SDRAM families standardized by JEDEC, the clock signal controls the stepping of an internal finite state machine that responds to incoming commands. These commands can be pipelined to improve performance, with previously started operations completing while new commands are received. The memory is divided into several equally sized but independent sections called banks, allowing the device to operate on a memory access commands in each bank simultaneously and speed access in an interleaved fashion. [...] This allows SDRAMs to achieve greater concurrency and higher data transfer rates than asynchronous <b>DRAMs</b> could.|$|E

Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out.

Results: Data from 467 women were analyzed. Above the umbilicus, the prevalence of <b>DRAM</b> > 2 cm was 68 %. Below the umbilicus, the prevalence of <b>DRAM</b> > 2 cm was 32 %. The prevalence of <b>DRAM</b> above the umbilicus among primiparae and multiparae was identical (68 %), and the prevalence below the umbilicus was greater among multiparae (19. 8 % and 29. 2 %). The mean <b>DRAM</b> above the umbilicus was 2. 8 cm (± 1. 2) and the mean <b>DRAM</b> below the umbilicus was 1. 5 cm (± 1. 1), representing a significant difference (p= 0. 0001) and a weak correlation (r= 0. 461).

In this paper, we show that performance and energy efficiency {{can be obtained by}} software management of the die-stacked <b>DRAM,</b> which eliminates the need for tags, the source of aforemen-tioned problems. In the proposed scheme, the operating system loads pages from disks to the die-stacked <b>DRAM</b> on a page fault {{at the same time as}} they are loaded to the off-chip <b>DRAM.</b> Our scheme maintains the pages in the off-chip and the die-stacked <b>DRAM</b> in a synchronized/mirrored state by exploiting the parallel loading capability to the die-stacked and off-chip <b>DRAM</b> from the disk. This eliminates the need for physical page move-ment to the slower off-chip <b>DRAM</b> upon eviction from the die-stacked <b>DRAM.</b> Requests for pages that got evicted from the die-stacked <b>DRAM</b> are simply serviced by the slower off-chip <b>DRAM</b> to prevent frequent data movements of large pages and thrashing between conflicting pages.
