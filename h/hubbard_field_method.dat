We suggest concrete ways in which <b>field</b> <b>methods</b> can be integrated into classroom settings.

Numerous methods are available for estimating N mineralization. Laboratory methods are relatively easy but may not reflect conditions in the <b>field,</b> and <b>field</b> <b>methods</b> are usually labor-intensive.

Reference methods were the doubly labelled water method for physical activity, and a three- and a four-compartment model for body composition.
