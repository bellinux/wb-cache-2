5|$|There {{have been}} no anthologies drawn solely {{from the pages of}} Science Fantasy, but Weird Shadows <b>From</b> <b>Beyond,</b> edited by John Carnell, and {{published}} by Corgi Books in 1965, drew eight of its ten stories from the magazine.|$|E
5|$|A British {{edition of}} the {{magazine}} ran for four issues on a bimonthly schedule starting in November 1953 and finishing in May 1954. These copied the first four issues of the US version, with slightly cut contents. They were numbered 1 to 4 but were not dated. Ten years after the magazine folded, nine stories <b>from</b> <b>Beyond</b> were collected into the 160-page paperback Beyond, published in 1963 by Berkley Books (F712) and edited by Thomas Dardis (who was not credited on the book).|$|E

5|$|Although not a {{commercial}} success, it included several short stories by authors such as Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury and Philip K. Dick. The publication {{has been described}} by critics as a successor to the tradition of Unknown, a fantasy magazine that ceased publication in 1943. It was noted for printing fantasy with a rational basis such as werewolf stories that included scientific explanations. A selection of stories <b>from</b> <b>Beyond</b> was published in paperback form in 1963, also under the title Beyond.|$|E
5|$|Duquesne {{was plagued}} by a few issues during the 2009 season. Most notable were the poor free-throw and 3-point {{shooting}} percentages. Duquesne was last in the Atlantic 10 {{in both of these}} categories at 60.8% and 26.3% respectively. Despite their poor performance shooting <b>from</b> <b>beyond</b> the 3-point line, Duquesne still shot the fourth most three-pointers of all teams in the Atlantic 10. The following chart displays player per-game average statistics for the regular season and Atlantic 10 tournament.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, {{the names}} of 19 eze Nri were recorded, but the list is not easily {{converted}} into chronological terms because of long interregnums between installations. Tradition held that at least seven years would pass upon {{the death of the}} eze Nri before a successor could be determined; the interregnum served as a period of divination of signs from the deceased eze Nri, who would communicate his choice of successor <b>from</b> <b>beyond</b> the grave in the seven or more years ensuing upon his death.|$|E

5|$|In basketball, {{points are}} used {{to keep track of}} the score in a game. Points can be {{accumulated}} by making field goals (worth two points from within the three-point line or three points <b>from</b> <b>beyond</b> the three-point line) or free throws (worth one point). The team that records the most points at the end of a game is declared the game's winner. If the game is still tied at the end of regulation play, additional overtime period(s) are played in order to determine the winner.|$|E
5|$|In the 2013–14 season, Bosh {{played and}} started in 79 games, {{averaging}} 16.2 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. He also hit a career-high 74 three point shots on 33 percent shooting <b>from</b> <b>beyond</b> the arc. In the playoffs, Bosh helped the Heat {{return to the}} NBA Finals, where they faced the San Antonio Spurs once again. This time, however, the Heat were outclassed by the Spurs, as they lost the series in five games.|$|E
5|$|In {{the view}} of his biographer Hugh Macdonald, Massenet's main {{influences}} were Gounod and Thomas, with Meyerbeer and Berlioz also important to his style. <b>From</b> <b>beyond</b> France he absorbed some traits from Verdi, and possibly Mascagni, and above all Wagner. Unlike some other French composers of the period, Massenet never fell fully under Wagner's spell, but he took from the earlier composer a richness of orchestration and a fluency in treatment of musical themes.|$|E

5|$|A {{moderate}} {{risk for}} severe weather was {{issued by the}} Storm Prediction Center two days prior to the event. The storm then moved across {{the most of the}} Midwest on October 18, where a moderate risk was in effect also for two days for most of Illinois, Indiana and parts of Kentucky, although the moderate risk was revised further to the south and east to include western Ohio, western Tennessee, southeastern Missouri, northeastern Arkansas and a larger portion of Kentucky while Michigan and Wisconsin were no longer under a moderate risk. A slight risk of severe weather was forecast for a large area <b>from</b> <b>beyond</b> the Canada–US border to the Florida Panhandle and Mobile Bay. Dew points above 70°F (21°C) were reported well into the Ohio Valley, and dew points above 60°F (16°C) were reported as far north as northern Ontario.|$|E
5|$|A strong game by Doug Williams {{carried the}} Buccaneers despite an anemic rushing attack. Both teams later complained about officiating errors and the {{malfunctioning}} game clock. The Metropolitan Stadium 30-second clock failed {{for the second}} week in a row, as did both regulation clocks. The Buccaneers survived a last-minute drive by the Vikings in which quarterback Tommy Kramer was penalized for throwing a pass <b>from</b> <b>beyond</b> the line of scrimmage, which helped to keep the Vikings out of field goal range. Curtis Jordan sealed the victory by deflecting Kramer's last-second Hail Mary pass. Kramer later admitted to being aware of having crossed the line of scrimmage, but had hoped that the officials would miss it as they had missed so many other penalties in the game.|$|E
5|$|After {{interrogation}} by Doggett, Purnell {{confesses to}} snatching Billy in 1990 {{on behalf of}} someone else. Doggett recognizes Purnell was also a victim, and with enough prodding, gets a name: Cal Jeppy. The police and the two FBI agents go to Jeppy’s home and find Josh in a compartment under {{the floor of his}} horse trailer. Doggett chases Jeppy into the woods, catches him, and discovers the skull of Billy that Purnell dug up earlier. As the Underwoods stand over the shallow grave of their long dead son, Scully and Doggett discuss the case. Scully believes it was justice <b>from</b> <b>beyond</b> the grave and that {{the important thing is that}} it saved Josh Underwood.|$|E

5|$|In air combat, the Phantom's {{greatest}} advantage was its thrust, which {{permitted a}} skilled pilot to {{engage and disengage}} from the fight at will. As a massive fighter aircraft designed to fire radar-guided missiles <b>from</b> <b>beyond</b> visual range, it lacked the agility of its Soviet opponents and was subject to adverse yaw during hard maneuvering. Although thus subject to irrecoverable spins during aileron rolls, pilots reported the aircraft to be very communicative and easy to fly {{on the edge of}} its performance envelope. In 1972, the F-4E model was upgraded with leading edge slats on the wing, greatly improving high angle of attack maneuverability at the expense of top speed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the modern}} era, Cluj's {{population}} experienced two phases of rapid growth, {{the first in}} the late 19th century, when the city grew in importance and size, and the second during the Communist period, when a massive urbanisation campaign was launched and many people migrated from rural areas and <b>from</b> <b>beyond</b> the Carpathians to the county's capital. About two-thirds of the population growth during this era was based on net migration inflows; after 1966, the date of Ceaușescu's ban on abortion and contraception, natural increase was also significant, being responsible for the remaining third.|$|E
5|$|Mary Alice Young is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the ABC television series Desperate Housewives. The character {{was created by}} television producer and screenwriter Marc Cherry and is portrayed by Brenda Strong, who also serves as the narrator of the series <b>from</b> <b>beyond</b> the grave; the character's suicide in the pilot episode served as the catalyst of the series.
