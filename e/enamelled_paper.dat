50|$|In the Summer of 1962 Cavellini {{decided to}} resume his {{activity}} as an artist, initially with dadaist works. He experimented with materials such as imprints of leaves, <b>enamel,</b> blotting <b>paper,</b> collages, toilet paper, razor blades. In 1965 he exhibited a dozen works at the Apollinaire Gallery in Milan. With the help of Giovanni Fiorini he created homages to Georges Braque, Henri Matisse, Giorgio Morandi, Joan Miró, Fernand Léger and Giorgio De Chirico. He also composed mosaics of painted wood, which he transformed in enormous stamps. Then he started to destroy his works, dissect them {{and put them in}} small caged. He also burned his works, creating the Carboni (Carbons), i.e. carbonizzate partly painted with bright colors.|$|R
40|$|Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a {{group of}} {{hereditary}} disorders that affect the quality and/or quantity of dental <b>enamel.</b> This <b>paper</b> describes the clinicopathological features of a patient who was born of nonconsanguineous parents and who presented with oral alterations, including yellow and misshapen teeth, intrapulpal calcifications, delayed tooth eruption, and gum enlargement. Scanning electron microscopy of the teeth revealed hypoplastic enamel, and a renal ultrasound detected bilateral nephrocalcinosis, leading to a diagnosis of AI and nephrocalcinosis syndrome. Since nephrocalcinosis is often asymptomatic and can be associated with impaired renal function, dentists who see children with a generalized and thin hypoplastic AI should consider a renal ultrasound scan and referral to a Nephrologist. Children with nephrocalcinosis should also be considered for a dental check...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{concerns}} {{the development of}} liposomal formulations that can adsorb to the human dental enamel. The overall aim of this pharmaceutical approach is to physically protect the teeth against detrimental processes, such as tooth wear, acidic challenges and dental caries. Adsorption experiments of different liposomal formulations to hydroxyapatite (HA), a model substance for the dental hard tissue, and the human dental enamel were performed. To find which liposomal formulations are promising for the adsorption to teeth, formulation factors important for the interaction were initially mapped {{by the use of}} experimental design and multivariate analysis (Paper I). The type of surface charge became the most significant factor for the adsorption process. Positively charged liposomes adsorbed better than the negatively charged liposomes to HA in phosphate buffer, pH 6. 8 - 7. However, the adsorption of positively charged liposomes to HA in a salivary environment was interfered as they were found to aggregate with components of saliva (Paper II). To overcome problems related to the positively charged liposomes, the surface of the liposomes was modified with the polymer pectin. Three types of pectin were investigated for the surface coating of liposomes: LM-, HM- and amidated pectin (Paper III). Pectin coating of positively charged liposomes was successfully prepared, and a reproducible method was established. Pectin coated liposomes did not seem to interact with salivary components (Paper IV), and were therefore promising for use in the oral cavity. Pectin coated liposomes adsorbed to HA in saliva, and liposomes coated with LMand HM-pectin were selected for further investigation with the dental <b>enamel</b> (<b>Paper</b> IV). Both uncoated negatively charged liposomes and pectin coated liposomes adsorbed onto enamel specimens in a salivary environment (Paper IV), indicating their potential use in the protection of the teeth. The adsorption was examined by exposing a flow on the enamel surfaces for certain time intervals. Pectin coated liposomes seemed to retain better than uncoated negatively charged liposomes at longer time intervals. It was hypothesized that pectin may help to prolong the adhesion of liposomes on the tooth surfaces...|$|R

40|$|The tribosphenic molar is an ancestral type of {{mammalian}} {{teeth and}} a phy- lotypic {{stage of the}} mammalian dental evolution. Yet, in contrast to derived teeth types, its enamel microarchitecture attracted only little attention and the information on that subject is often restricted to statements suggesting a simple homogenous arrangement of a primitive radial prismatic <b>enamel.</b> The present <b>paper</b> tests this prediction with aid of comparative study of eight model species representing the orders Chiroptera, Afrosoricida, Eulipotyphla (Erinaceomorpha) and Eulipotyphla (Soricomorpha).

The detailed electron microscopic (SEM) analysis of standardized cross sections over essential structural elements of tribosphenic molars (in shrews supplemented with sections of the lower incisor, the most derived tooth of the dentition) was a basic source of information. The results demonstrated common arrangements related to tribosphenic design (he- terotopy of enamel thickness, radial prismatic enamels as primary product of ameloge- netic activity), yet, an unexpectedly broad span of variation in state of further variables was discovered at the same time.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this doctoral thesis was {{to contribute to a}} better understanding of the factors influencing the degree of conversion and its importance with regard to the potential elution of monomers as well as regarding the bonding effectiveness to tooth tissue, this in light of an overall research objective to optimize the properties of dental restorative materials for general human health safety and more specifically long-term tooth-restoration durability. This PhD dissertation comprises three subprojects, namely Project Part 1, entitled ‘Determination of polymerization properties of dental adhesives’, Project Part 2, entitled ‘Qualification and quantification of compounds released from dental adhesives’, and Project Part 3, entitled ‘Bonding effectiveness influenced by polymerization efficiency as measured using a new mini-interfacial fracture toughness test’. Project Part 1 (CHAPTER 2) focused on the effect of evaporation of adhesive ingredients of a universal, one-component, one-step self-etch adhesive on (1) the degree of conversion (DC), (2) the ultimate micro-tensile strength (UµTS), and (3) the micro-tensile bond strength (µTBS) to dentin. We aimed to investigate in PAPER 1 to what extent ingredients of dental adhesives may evaporate before a physical property as DC and a mechanical property as UµTS are affected and thereby jeopardize the adhesive’s bonding potential and thus its shelf life. PAPER 1 more specifically investigated the effect of evaporation on the shelf life of the universal adhesive Scotchbond Universal (3 M ESPE) using a weight-loss measurement technique. DC was determined using ATR-FTIR on different substrates (glass, glass at 37 °C, dentin, dentin at 37 °C, dehydrated dentin and dentin powder). The results disclosed that the evaporation of adhesive ingredients did affect DC, UμTS, and µTBS of the universal adhesive. In conclusion, the evaporation of adhesive ingredients may jeopardize the shelf life of an universal adhesive that will polymerize less effectively; however, the negative effects only became evident when more than 50 % by weight of the adhesive ingredients were evaporated. As part of Project Part 2 (CHAPTER 3), adhesive formulations that differed for the kind and concentration of photo-initiator were employed to measure DC and the elution of two common methacrylate monomers (PAPER 2). In PAPER 2, the two most common photo-initiator systems, namely CQ/amine and TPO, were added in a relatively ‘low’ and ‘high’ concentration to obtain eight different experimental one-step self-etch adhesive formulations, this in order to evaluate (1) the effect of photo-initiator on DC, as measured using µRaman, and (2) the elution of BisGMA and HEMA, as measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results disclosed that the kind and concentration of the photo-initiators CQ/amine and TPO influenced DC and the elution of BisGMA and HEMA. At ‘high’ concentration, CQ/amine and TPO resulted in a similar DC and monomer elution, while TPO appeared more efficient at ‘low’ concentration. An inverse correlation was observed between DC and the elution of BisGMA and HEMA. As part of Project Part 3 (CHAPTER 4), a new, simplified and miniaturized ‘single gradient notched beam’ (SGNB) fracture-toughness set-up, being referred to as ‘mini-interfacial fracture toughness’ (mini-iFT), was validated on its potential and applicability to assess bonding effectiveness to tooth tissue. Validation of the mini-iFT test was conducted by measuring (1) the mini-iFT at dentin, as compared to the respective µTBS to dentin (PAPER 3), and (2) the mini-iFT at <b>enamel</b> (<b>PAPER</b> 4). In addition, the same experimental adhesive formulations, as were tested in PAPER 2, were now used (3) to record the polymerization kinetics up to one week after light-curing using µRaman (PAPER 5), and (4) to measure the long-term bonding effectiveness in terms of mini-iFT after 6 -month and 1 -year water-storage ageing, in comparison to the 1 -week mini-iFT (PAPER 6). The research hypothesis investigated in PAPER 3 was that the iFT measurement is a more valid method to assess bonding effectiveness to tooth tissue as compared to conventional bond-strength testing. The mini-iFT test was designed and validated using commercial adhesives representing the today available different classes of adhesives. The mini-iFT data were directly compared to data gathered using the currently most popular µTBS test protocol, this to correlatively analyze the accuracy, reliability and discriminative power of both tests with regard to their potential to assess bonding effectiveness to dentin. Four dental adhesives, along which a 3 -step etch-and-rinse (E&R), a 2 -step self-etch (SE) and an ‘universal’ adhesive applied in a 2 -step E&R and 1 -step SE mode, and a glass-ionomer cement (GIC) were included. Both the mini-iFT and µTBS test revealed the same ranking in performance among the adhesives and the GIC tested. The 3 -step E&R adhesive outperformed the 2 -step SE and the universal adhesive applied in the 2 -step E&R mode, these on their turn the universal adhesive applied in the 1 -step SE mode, and finally the GIC. It was concluded that the mini-iFT method was more discriminative than the µTBS test, with the mini-iFT reflecting better the actual interfacial adhesive strength. In PAPER 4, the bonding effectiveness of adhesives to human enamel was determined using the new mini-iFT test. The mini-iFT was found to be significantly higher for the adhesives applied in an E&R mode versus those applied in a SE mode. The lowest mini-iFT was recorded for the adhesives applied following a 1 -step SE approach. This study confirmed that the mini-iFT test protocol is a valid alternative method to assess the strength of the adhesive-enamel interface. In PAPERS 5 and 6, the experimental adhesive formulations that differed for the photo-initiator systems (CQ/amine versus TPO) applied in a ‘low’ and ‘high’ concentration, as they were tested in PAPER 2, were used to determine the polymerization kinetics up to one week using µRaman and the bonding effectiveness in terms of mini-iFT upon 1 -week, 6 -month and 1 -year water-storage ageing. The highest and most reliable mini-iFT was measured for the experimental adhesive formulation, to which the photo-initiator CQ/amine was added in the ‘high’ concentration. After 6 -month ageing, the mini-iFT remained stable for the high photo-initiator concentrated adhesive formulations and the control commercial adhesive, though a significantly reduced mini-iFT was measured upon 1 -year ageing. From this PhD research project, the following main conclusions were drawn: Evaporation of adhesive ingredients of a universal adhesive affects DC. DC of an adhesive should be determined when applied on dentin to best reflect the clinical situation. DC influences the elution of monomer from one-step SE adhesives, although DC is not the only influencing factor. The innovatively mini-iFT test appears a valid method to assess bonding effectiveness to tooth tissue. Not only DC influences bonding effectiveness; other factors like cross-linking density and monomer chain length are important as well. The mini-iFT test facilitates assessing bond durability upon long-term ageing.
