40|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} the ninth leading cause of female cancer deaths in Hong Kong. In 2011, 391 new cases of {{cervical}} cancer were diagnosed and the age-standardized incidence rate was 7. 2 per 100, 000 standard populations. In 2012, 133 women died from this cancer, accounting for 2. 5 % of female cancer deaths. The age-standardized death rate of cervical cancer was 2. 1 per 100, 000 standard populations. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is an established cause of cervical cancer. HPV vaccines offer more than 70 % protection for women against HPV types 16 and 18 infections and their related cervical precancerous lesions and cervical cancer. As there are usually no symptoms in high-risk HPV infection, it is often diagnosed at a late stage. Regular cervical smears can offer early detection of pathological changes and pre-cancerous stage for a timely medical treatment to prevent progression to cervical cancer. The Cervical Screening Programme (CSP) of Department of Health (DH) was launched on 8 March 2004. It is a voluntary program with the objectives to increase the population coverage of cervical screening among women and to reduce the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer in Hong Kong. Women participating in the programme are encouraged to have cervical smears in the medical centres of their own choices and to provide their cervical smear information through their health care providers to the central registry of the CSP - The Cervical Screening Information System (CSIS). As at 31 December 2013, 491, 674 women have registered with CSP. When DH implemented CSP in March 2004, a report {{was published in the}} same year showing evidence that an organized screening compared with the opportunistic screening could substantially increase benefits and reduce costs. Another local study conducted <b>early</b> <b>this</b> <b>year</b> supported <b>by</b> the Health Services Research Fund also highlighted the importance and urgency in enhancing the current screening protocol. It is of public health interests to study and compare the programme outcomes with countries like Finland, Australia, UK and Japan where different policy was adopted for the prevention of cervical cancer. Information gathered from research papers on epidemiological studies has been collected and analyzed on population benefit (outcome, access, disparities), cost (cost benefit, efficiency, cost containment), equity, feasibility and constituency perspectives in formulation of the policy alternatives. In conclusion, strengthening what is already in place with better allocative efficiency could protect the female population against cervical cancer. From the education perspective, emphasis on the risk of HPV infection in the sex education curriculum would raise the awareness on the precaution of HPV infections amongst young females. Additionally, vaccination at the age of 12 can provide protection against most types of HPV. It is strongly recommended that a cervical screening and HPV co-testing strategy at a triennial interval could provide the best cost and benefit effectiveness. Together they can enhance protection coverage of women at 12 through immunization and from 25 - 64 through active population screening. The ultimate objectives to reduce incidence, mortality and increase coverage could be achieved. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R
40|$|This report {{argues that}} huge changes in Australia’s gas market will push up the average {{household}} bill in Melbourne {{by more than}} $ 300 a year, and in Sydney and Adelaide by more than $ 100 a year. Overview For some time the price of natural gas has been rising well above the cost of living. As with electricity, rising network prices are {{the main reason for}} a 36 per cent increase in average gas bills over the past five years. But in the next few years, huge changes in the gas market will push up prices even more sharply, adding more than $ 300 a year to the average household gas bill in Melbourne and over $ 100 a year in Sydney and Adelaide. The increases will mean tough decisions for many households and businesses. Natural gas is one of Australia’s main sources of energy. We use it to cook, heat water and heat our homes. It is an important fuel source for businesses such as dry cleaners and commercial food processors. Some large industries, such as explosives and fertilisers, use it heavily as a primary material in production. It is also used to produce electricity, and produces fewer CO 2 emissions than coal does, while being more affordable than most renewable energy sources. Gas has always been commercially competitive, with heating qualities that most prefer to electricity. But Australia is about to undergo changes that will {{have a major impact on}} how we use gas. Gas producers have been building Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) facilities, mostly in Queensland, since 2010, and will start exporting as <b>early</b> as <b>this</b> <b>year.</b> <b>By</b> 2018 east coast gas, added to growing Western Australian supplies, could create the world’s biggest gas export industry, worth $ 60 billion a year. The economic benefits that will flow as a result represent an opportunity too good to miss. The downside is that domestic gas prices will increase to compete with the higher prices that other countries are prepared to pay for our gas. As a result, many households will reconsider the benefits of gas against electricity. Some will replace gas appliances with electrical ones and won’t return any time soon. Most may just cope with higher prices, because they still prefer gas for cooking or heating, or they aren’t able to justify the immediate cost of switching or they are just confused by the competing choices. Business gas users may be able to pass costs onto customers, or be forced to consider alternative energy sources. The implications for manufacturing output and jobs in gas-intensive sectors are bad indeed. Electricity produced by gas (gas-fired power) is likely to be priced out of the electricity market, except to meet short-term peaks in demand. A shift away from gas means a shift back to coal. Such a trend is already being seen, and is bad news for the climate. Australia’s 2020 emissions target will be harder to meet. Many affected groups will demand protection from price increases. Since household users make up a large share of voters, and the gas industry has failed to prepare its customers for the shift to higher prices, the pressure on governments to keep gas cheap is likely to be strong. They should resist it. Consumers face higher prices, but the economic benefits of the change will be overwhelmingly positive. Governments should avoid poorly designed intervention. Instead, they should remove barriers to a healthy market, and ensure that all Australians share in the value of our gas revolution...|$|R

40|$|This Report This is {{the second}} {{progress}} report for AMIRA Project P 384 A and covers work carried out during the six months April to October 1996 to be presented at the October meeting, and two outstanding reports from the first meeting. Good {{progress has been made}} to date and much of the material covered here results from fieldwork undertaken <b>earlier</b> <b>this</b> <b>year.</b> The reports <b>by</b> Bull, Keele et al. and Duffett distinguish structures that controlled sedimentation on the Lawn Hill Platform during early McNamara Group times, from later (usually more obvious) structures. <b>This</b> <b>early</b> "grain" was an important control on deformation intensity during later orogeny. Their work has implications for understanding the location of deposits that lack obvious proximal syn-sedimentary structures such as Lady Loretta and Century, and more fundamental implications for understanding the controls on basin scale fluid flow. The halo studies work at McArthur River has been extended to drill hole Homestead 6 which is 2 km along strike from the HYC orebody. The report by Large and Bull combines this new geochemical and C/O isotope data with results from AMlRA Project P 384 to complete the HYC halo model. New C/O isotope data show that C and O isotopes are a powerful method for discriminating MnOD and AI 3 halos directly related to ore from those that indicate a favourable horizon for Pb-Zn mineralisation. Geochemical studies of the upper greenschist to lower amphibolite grade metasedimentary hosts to the Mt Novit pyritic mineralisation are described in the report by McGoldrick. This work shows that Mt Novit has a (relatively) weak lithogeochemical vector signature (SedexAI, AI 3, MnOD and Tl) that is preserved during moderate to high grade metamorphism. The report by Cooke and Large documents computer modelling of Mn transport in hydrothermal fluids presented at the last meeting, and discusses implications for differences in the genesis of McArthur-type and Broken Hill-type Zn-Pb deposits. The report by Winefield is a detailed outline of work to be included in his PhD. The PhD entitled "Sedimentology and diagenetic history of late Palaeoproterozoic sequences within the southern McArthur Basin, northern Australia" has logistic support from AMIRA Project P 384 A. Also to be presented at the meeting, but not reported here, are a description of the Grevillea prospect and recent sampling for halo studies (McGoldrick and Bull). Cooke will present results of preliminary geochemical modelling of Cu and Fe in hydrothermal solutions. The sampling strategy for illite crystallinity studies of lower McNamara group rocks will be discussed by Keele. Bull and McGoldrick will discuss the outcomes from a recent visit to the Belt Basin and visits to the Sullivan mine (B.
