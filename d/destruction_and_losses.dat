40|$|Exergoeconomic {{analysis}} of {{a nuclear power plant}} is a focus of this dissertation. Specifically, the performance of the Palo Verde Nuclear Power Plant in Arizona is examined. The analysis combines thermodynamic second law exergy analysis with economics in order to assign costs to the loss and destruction of exergy. This work was done entirely with an interacting spreadsheets notebook. The procedures are to first determine conventional energy flow, where the thermodynamic stream state points are calculated automatically. Exergy flow is then evaluated along with <b>destruction</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses.</b> The capital cost and fixed investment rate used for the economics do not apply specifically to the Palo Verde Plant. Exergy costing is done next involving the solution of about 90 equations by matrix inversion. Finally, the analysis assigns cost to the exergy <b>destruction</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> in each component. In this work, the cost of electricity (exergy), including capital cost, leaving the generator came to 38, 400 $/hr. The major exergy destruction occurs in the reactor where fission energy transfer is limited by the maximum permissible clad temperature. Exergy destruction costs were: reactor [...] 18, 207 $/hr, the low pressure turbine [...] 2, 000 $/hr, the condenser [...] 1, 700 $/hr, the steam generator [...] 1, 200 $/hr. The inclusion of capital cost and O&M are important in new system design assessments. When investigating operational performance, however, these are sunk costs; only fuel cost needs to be considered. The application of a case study is included based on a real modification instituted at Palo Verde to reduce corrosion steam generator problems; the pressure in the steam generator was reduced from 1072 to 980 psi. Exergy destruction costs increased in the low pressure turbine and in the steam generator, but decreased in the reactor vessel and the condenser. The dissertation demonstrates the procedures and tools required for exergoeconomic analysis whether in the evaluation of a new nuclear reactor system concept, or in the assessment of the economic performance in operating plants...|$|E

Compared to CO 2, R 32 has higher thermal conductivity and condenses easily. The energy and exergy analyses of the cycle with these two fluids shows that the R 32 -based transcritical Rankine cycle can achieve 12. 6 - 18. 7 % higher thermal efficiency and works at much lower pressures. An analysis of the exergy <b>destruction</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> {{as well as the}} exergy efficiency optimization of the transcritical Rankine cycle is conducted.

40|$|England {{entered the}} First World War (WWI) on 4 August 1914, {{and it is}} a pivotal event for the world history, and more specifically, for the {{comprehension}} of the twentieth century due to the enormous impact it caused in society. Once WWI finished, the world was no longer as it had been previously. It brought, on the one hand, the end of the geopolitical order known until the nineteenth century. This way, we can appreciate the disappearance of four empires, the German, the Turkish, the Russian, and the Austro- Hungarian one, giving birth to other new nations that will occupy their places on the map. In Russia, we will find the establishment of the Bolshevik Government, while the United States of America will become a new world power.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{migration in}} Cambodia on the background the country s current situation, {{its history and}} culture. Specifically the thesis discusses why and in what way individuals reach the decision to migrate, their experiences in doing so, and their coping strategies after arriving at their destinations. Fieldwork was conducted {{in areas of the}} country considered as important as source and destination of migration. In a historical perspective, the relation to the Vietnamese minority and immigration to Cambodia is discussed on the background of the long history of conflict between the two nations. Ethnic Khmer migration, however, dates back to the Khmer Rouge regime and its forcible evacuation of the cities, and to the more than twenty years of war before and after that. Culture defines values and a framework for acceptable choices and behaviour. In the context of migration, it concerns the decision to migrate, as well as coping strategies. Many Khmer feel that their culture has been lost because of the <b>destruction</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> of lives and the forced migration. The thesis discusses the background for this and argues that Khmer culture has changed over time like all cultures. Based on the country s current situation, the relations between push and pull factors and between sending and receiving provinces are analysed. The thesis also discusses the central role of social networks, above all in relation to the young, female workers in the garment industry. The importance of combining micro- and macroperspectives in a study of migration is emphasised, and the thesis discusses the fruitfulness of the distinctions between different categories of migration, specifically between voluntary and forced migration...|$|E

40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Agronómica - Protecção das Plantas - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaIn Portugal, rice {{crops are}} very {{important}} in the Portuguese agriculture with rice market valued at 200000 tons. In our country the average consumption per capita is the highest in Europe around 17 Kg per year. Rice {{is one of the}} most staple food of over half world-wide population, so the <b>destruction</b> <b>and</b> <b>losses</b> that could take place during storage can affect the food reserves. Most food processed in the industry are susceptible to a variety of enemies that will be able to cause damages in the product before and after the processing. In storage, the presence of fungi is a problem of difficult resolution. In particular Aspergillus, Fusarium and Penicillium species are the most responsible for qualitative and quantitative losses in cereals. Under specific conditions they can produce mycotoxins that can be responsible for economical injuries and public health risks. Mycotoxins study has got some importance because of the direct and indirect economical injuries that cause in the industry. The aim of this work was to contribute for the knowledge of the stored rice mycobiota which is processed in Portugal. Under this work six national rice samples from 2006 campaign (paddy rice, brown rice and polished rice), and three samples of imported rice (brown rice and polished rice) with 3 to 13 months of storage were studied. The samples came from a Portuguese processing industry, and all national rice samples studied belong to Ariete (two samples), Gládio (two samples), Fani (one sample) and Albatros (one sample) varieties. The evaluation of the mycobiota, of a national rice samples and an imported rice samples, shows a greater diversity of species in national rice than in the imported rice. In national rice samples were identified 55 taxa while 20 taxa were found in the imported rice samples in a total of 57 identified taxa, from field fungi and storage fungi. Species like Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus candidus, A. flavus, A. fumigatus, A. niger, A. terreus, Bipolaris oryzae, Chaetomium trilaterale, Fusarium semitectum, Nigrospora oryzae, Penicillium islandicum, Syncephalastrum racemosum, Trichoderma harzianum, Trichoconiella padwickii, Trichotecium roseum and a Geotrichum specie are the same in national rice samples and in imported rice samples. In paddy rice and brown rice samples, the most common taxon were Aspergillus, Eurotium and Alternaria species, while in polished rice was only Aspergillus and Eurotium. It was observed that fungi diversity decreases along the process (paddy rice, brown rice and polished rice), where the polishment is particularly effective in the fungi reduction. However for the elimination of storage fungi, the polish was not so efficient as it was with field fungi, because the isolations carried out in the polish rice corresponded in some cases to 60 % or more of the isolations effectuated in the brown rice. For the polished rice samples, the Aspergillus and Eurotium species appeared with bigger frequency than Penicillium and Fusarium ones. Relatively to the type of storage, in silo or in bin it was observed that the samples with bigger diversity of storage fungi were originating from silos, and field fungi appeared more in the samples originating from bin. From the studied samples a total of 170 taxa were identified namely Absidia, Alternaria, Aspergillus, Bipolaris, Chaetomium, Curvularia, Epicoccum, Eurotium, Fusarium, Nigrospora, Mucor, Penicillium, Rhizopus, Sordaria, Stemphylium, Syncephalastrum, Trichoderma, Trichoconiella, Trichotecium, Ulocladium species.
