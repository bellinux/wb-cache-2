5|$|Enderlin {{responded to}} Leconte and Jeambar in January 2005 in Le Figaro. <b>He</b> <b>thanked</b> them for rejecting that the scene had been staged.

In the days following the shooting, other witnesses, including other journalists, offered some confirmation, he said. He added that the Israeli army had not responded to France 2's offers to cooperate with their investigation.|$|E
5|$|His non-selection in {{previous}} years was widely debated in the media. Bure was often compared with Cam Neely, a player who also waited six years for induction; he recorded similar goals-per-game numbers in a career that was also shortened to 700-plus games. It had been often rumoured that Pat Quinn, Bure's former head coach and general manager in Vancouver, who became co-chairman of the Hockey Hall of Fame's selection committee, opposed Bure's induction. However, {{in a conference call}} following his selection, Quinn was among the most prominent figures <b>he</b> <b>thanked.</b> Quinn criticized the Canucks organization for not yet retiring Bure's jersey.|$|E

She maintains that it is valuable as an ancient symbol of peace, and that it has been unfairly associated with Nazi Germany.|$|E
