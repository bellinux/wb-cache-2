40|$|For {{the purpose}} of quantum <b>heterointegration</b> of group IV semiconductors, atomically {{controlled}} plasma processing by utilizing an electron-cyclotron-resonance (ECR) plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (CVD) at low temperature has been developed to achieve atomic-layer doping and heterostructure formation with nanometer-order thickness control as well as smooth and abrupt interfaces. In this paper, recent typical achievements in the plasma processing are reviewed: (1) By N and B atomic-layer formation and Si epitaxial growth on Si(100), heavy atomic-layer doping was demonstrated. Most of the incorporated N or B atoms can be confined in an about 2 nm-thick region. (2) highly-strained and relaxed Ge films on Si(100) with atomic-order flatness can be epitaxially grown. (3) Using a 84 % relaxed Ge buffer layer formed on Si(100), formation of a highly strained Si film with nanometer-order thickness was achieved...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{fabrication}} of a bulk micromachined hybrid torsional micromirror device composed of titanium mirror structures bonded to an underlying silicon sloping electrode structure. The fabrication {{of the device}} is enabled by two recent innovations: 1) the Metal Anisotropic Reactive Ion etching with Oxidation (MARIO) Process [1], which provides, for the first time, high aspect ratio micromachining capability in bulk titanium; and 2) the High Aspect Ratio Laminated Metal Micromachining (HARLMM) Process, which allows for creation of complex, multilayer titanium devices and <b>heterointegration</b> of these devices with dissimilar material substrates. This work represents the first demonstration of the MARIO and HARLMM Processes in a device application. Details on the fabrication of the device are presented illustrating the simplifications {{made possible by the}}se two processes and additional simplifications made possible by the single-mask process used to create the sloping electrode structure...|$|E

The use of compositionally graded substrates to achieve <b>heterointegration</b> across different materials platforms such as Si, Ge and GaAs has proven successful and dual junction solar cells have been fabricated on such substrates. The potential for graded substrates in the solar market is discussed considering the current technology, market players and worldwide renewable energy policies.

40|$|System {{integration}} technology requires multifunctionality and in {{many cases}} energy autarkic systems, very cost-efficient or open form factor solutions. Integration in plastic or foil substrates by a flex-to-flex integration concept shows the potentially free form factor which allows placing of film based systems on curved surfaces or in housings of very low thickness. Such technologies are not limited to flexible applications. They are available for optimized rigid modules and improve the heat sink by thinning and foil handling of transceiver chips or power devices. Thin semiconductor technologies are not limited to silicon, enabling also <b>heterointegration</b> with compound semiconductors. Meanwhile it is possible to integrate high frequency interconnects and printed passives in plastic foil and thin silicon interposer. Possible application scenarios are large area electronics in ceilings panels of cars or mobile communication systems for the "internet of things and humans"...|$|E
40|$|For {{the purpose}} of <b>heterointegration</b> of Si-based group IV {{semiconductor}} quantum effect devices into Si large-scale integrated circuit, formation of atomically flat heterointerfaces in quantum heterostructure by lowering Si barrier growth temperature was investigated {{in order to improve}} negative differential conductance (NDC) characteristics of high-Ge-fraction strained Si 1 -xGex/Si hole resonant tunneling diode. It was found that roughness generation at heterointerfaces is drastically suppressed by utilizing, Si barriers with nanometer order thickness deposited using Si 2 H 6 reaction at a lower temperature of 400 oC instead of SiH 4 reaction at 500 oC after the Si 0. 42 Ge 0. 58 growth. NDC characteristics show that difference between peak and valley currents is effectively enhanced at 11 - 295 K by using Si 2 H 6 at 400 oC, compared with that using SiH 4 at 500 oC. Thermionic-emission dominant characteristics at higher temperatures above 100 K indicates a possibility that introduction of larger barrier height (i. e., larger band discontinuity) enhances the NDC at room temperature by suppression of thermionic-emission current...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{measured}} performance of monolithic integrated mm-wave switching circuits which operate at Ka-Band. V-Band and W-Band {{as well as on}} a technology for multi-functional MMICs. The coplanar switches are using high-performance InGaAs PIN diodes as active switching elements. The focus of the illustrated measurement results is on the characteristics of the W-Band switches. The SPST (single-pole single-throw) switches exhibit a low minimum insertion loss of 0. 66 dB (1. 17 dB) at 85 GHz (84 GHz) with an extremely high corresponding isolation of 29. 2 dB (24. 5 dB). Even under extremely low DC-power consumption conditions of 0. 95 mW (0. 8 mW), the switches demonstrated impressive isolations of 23. 7 dB (20. 7 dB). Excellent mm-wave performance is also achieved with the 94 GHz SPDT (single-pole double-throw) switch. An insertion loss as low as 1. 4 dB in transmit mode and 1. 8 dB at 96 GHz in receive mode is obtained. A very high isolation value greater than 40 dB is observed. Furthermore, we are developing a <b>heterointegration</b> technology for multi-functional MMICs and present a first comparison between heterointegrated SPST switches (PIN + HFET layer structure) and the normal SPST switches (only PIN structure) ...|$|E
40|$|Firefly Technologies, in {{collaboration}} with the Rochester Institute of Technology and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, developed synthesis methods for highly strained nanowires. Two synthesis routes resulted in successful nanowire epitaxy: direct nucleation and growth on the substrate and a novel selective-epitaxy route based on nanolithography using diblock copolymers. The indium-arsenide (InAs) nanowires are implemented in situ within the epitaxy environment-a significant innovation relative to conventional semiconductor nanowire generation using ex situ gold nanoparticles. The introduction of these nanoscale features may enable an intermediate band solar cell while simultaneously increasing the effective absorption volume that can otherwise limit short-circuit current generated by thin quantized layers. The use of nanowires for photovoltaics decouples the absorption process from the current extraction process by virtue of the high aspect ratio. While no functional solar cells resulted from this effort, considerable fundamental understanding of the nanowire epitaxy kinetics and nanopatterning process was developed. This approach could, in principle, be an enabling technology for <b>heterointegration</b> of dissimilar materials. The technology also is applicable to virtual substrates. Incorporating nanowires onto a recrystallized germanium/metal foil substrate would potentially solve the problem of grain boundary shunting of generated carriers by restricting the cross-sectional area of the nanowire (tens of nanometers in diameter) to sizes smaller than the recrystallized grains (0. 5 to 1 micron(exp 2) ...|$|E
40|$|Conventional Si complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) scaling is fast {{approaching}} its limits. The {{extension of the}} logic device roadmap for future enhancements in transistor performance requires non-Si materials and new device architectures. III-V materials, due to their superior electron transport properties, are well poised to replace Si as the channel material beyond the 10 nm technology node to mitigate the performance loss of Si transistors from further reductions in supply voltage to minimise power dissipation in logic circuits. However several key challenges, including a high quality dielectric/III-V gate stack, a low-resistance source/drain (S/D) technology, <b>heterointegration</b> onto a Si platform and a viable III-V p-metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect-transistor (MOSFET), {{need to be addressed}} before III-Vs can be employed in CMOS. This Thesis specifically addressed the development and demonstration of planar III-V p-MOSFETs, to complement the n-MOSFET, thereby enabling an all III-V CMOS technology to be realised. This work explored the application of InGaAs and InGaSb material systems as the channel, in conjunction with Al 2 O 3 /metal gate stacks, for p-MOSFET development based on the buried-channel flatband device architecture. The body of work undertaken comprised material development, process module development and integration into a robust fabrication flow for the demonstration of p-channel devices.
