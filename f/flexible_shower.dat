50|$|Some {{examples}} of home modifications include: increased lighting, accessible switches {{at both ends}} of the stairs, additional railings, grab bars, nonskid flooring, a hand-held <b>flexible</b> <b>shower</b> head, walk-in bathtubs, and the removal of throw rugs and clutter. In most cases, home modifications can be simple and cost-effective, while simultaneously offering substantial benefits to the individual. Other modifications to the home - especially those that require retrofitting - are a little more costly due to increased complexity of installation. These can include: ramps for accessible entry and exit, walk-in shower, sliding shelves, stairlifts, or even home elevators. Many homes are built or retrofitted with the Universal design model in mind, which makes everything in the home accessible to all people with or without functional limitations.|$|E
40|$|Legionella spp. and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) are {{opportunistic}} pathogens {{of public}} health concern. Hot water systems, including showers, {{have been identified as}} a potential source of infection. This paper describes the colonization of Legionella and MAC on the flexible tubing within a model potable shower system, utilizing thermostatic mixing and a <b>flexible</b> <b>shower</b> head. A MAC qPCR method of enumeration was also developed. MAC and Legionella spp. were detected within the biofilm at maximum concentrations of 7. 0 × 104 and 2. 0 × 103 copies/cm 2 PVC tubing respectively. No significant changes were observed between sample of the <b>flexible</b> <b>shower</b> tubing that dried between uses and those that remained filled with water. This suggested the “unhooking” showerheads and allowing them to dry is not an effective method {{to reduce the risk of}} Legionella or MAC colonisation...|$|E
50|$|Other common {{devices for}} {{containing}} water spray include a highly <b>flexible,</b> waterproof <b>shower</b> curtain, or more recently, a shower door, {{which is a}} permanently installed sliding or pivoting door made from glass or plastic. Containing water spray, leaks, and splashes within the bathtub is particularly important in bathrooms constructed with wooden under-flooring because water causes the wooden floor boards and floor joists to rot or decay over time, if left unattended.|$|R
40|$|CMS {{is looking}} forward to tune {{detector}} simulation using the forthcoming collision data from the LHC. CMS established a task force in February 2008 in order to understand and reconcile the discrepancies observed between the CMS calorimetry simulation and the test beam data recorded during 2004 and 2006. Within this framework, significant effort has been made to develop a strategy of tuning fast and <b>flexible</b> parameterizations describing <b>showering</b> in the calorimeter with available data from test beams. These parameterizations can be used within the context of Full as well as Fast Simulation. The study is extended to evaluate the use of first LHC collision data, when it becomes available, to rapidly tune the CMS calorimeter...|$|R
40|$|The {{physics of}} {{atmospheric}} cascades induced by ultrahigh energy cosmic rays above the GZK cutoff is investigated. A <b>flexible</b> air <b>shower</b> generator is {{developed for the}} exploration of air shower properties under various assumptions about the underlying hadronic physics. Included is an efficient algorithm for the simulation of electromagnetic cascades which emphasizes consistency with the standard Greisen formula for photons. The uncertainties in hadronic interaction physics relevant to air shower properties are bracketed with conservative models which characterize limiting scenarios. The effects of scaling violations in hadron-nucleon and hadron- nucleus iteractions are addressed. Emphasis is on the fragmentation region which is of most relevance to air shower development. The physics uncertainties imply an uncertainty in the average depth at maximum for proton induced cascades at the highest energies which {{is comparable to the}} separation between protons and iron. Consequently, {{it will be difficult to}} extract information about the composition at the highest energies. The possibility of detecting new physics or exotic primaries is discussed. Given the uncertainties associated the highest energies, very long interaction lengths are required in the initial stages of anomalous showers to clearly distinguish them from traditional scenarios (smooth evolution of the hadronic physics and a composition of protons and/or nuclei). An implementation of the LPM effect which suppresses electromagnetic cross sections in air at the highest energies is also described...|$|R
40|$|In {{this note}} we {{summarize}} the studies and {{recommendations of the}} calorimeter simulation task force (CaloTF). The CaloTF was established in February 2008 {{in order to understand}} and reconcile the discrepancies observed between the CMS calorimetry simulation and the test beam data recorded during 2004 and 2006. As the result of studies by the CaloTF a new version of Geant 4 was developed and introduced in the CMS detector simulation leading to significanly better agreement with test beam data. Fast and <b>flexible</b> parameterizations describing <b>showering</b> in the calorimeter are introduced both in the Full Simulation (with a Gflash-like approach) and in the Fast Simulation. The CaloTF has developed a strategy to rapidly tune the CMS calorimeter simulation using the first LHC collision data when it becomes available. The improvements delivered by the CaloTF have been implemented in the software release CMSSW 2. 1. 0...|$|R
