5|$|Boron is {{a useful}} dopant for such {{semiconductors}} as silicon, germanium, and silicon carbide. Having one fewer valence electron than the host atom, it donates a hole resulting in p-type conductivity. Traditional method of introducing boron into semiconductors is via its atomic diffusion at high temperatures. This process uses either solid (B2O3), liquid (BBr3), or gaseous boron sources (B2H6 or BF3). However, after the 1970s, it was mostly replaced by <b>ion</b> <b>implantation,</b> which relies mostly on BF3 as a boron source. Boron trichloride gas {{is also an important}} chemical in semiconductor industry, however not for doping but rather for plasma etching of metals and their oxides. Triethylborane is also injected into vapor deposition reactors as a boron source. Examples are the plasma deposition of boron-containing hard carbon films, silicon nitride-boron nitride films, and for doping of diamond film with boron.|$|E

500|$|Diamond {{has a wide}} bandgap of [...] {{corresponding}} to the deep ultraviolet wavelength of 225 nanometers. This means that pure diamond should transmit visible light and appear as a clear colorless crystal. Colors in diamond originate from lattice defects and impurities. The diamond crystal lattice is exceptionally strong, and only atoms of nitrogen, boron and hydrogen can be introduced into diamond during the growth at significant concentrations (up to atomic percents). Transition metals nickel and cobalt, which are commonly used for growth of synthetic diamond by high-pressure high-temperature techniques, have been detected in diamond as individual atoms; the maximum concentration is 0.01% for nickel and even less for cobalt. Virtually any element can be introduced to diamond by <b>ion</b> <b>implantation.</b>|$|E
500|$|Various {{elemental}} {{analyses of}} diamond reveal {{a wide range}} of impurities. They mostly originate, however, from inclusions of foreign materials in diamond, which could be nanometer-small and invisible in an optical microscope. Also, virtually any element can be hammered into diamond by <b>ion</b> <b>implantation.</b> More essential are elements which can be introduced into the diamond lattice as isolated atoms (or small atomic clusters) during the diamond growth. By 2008, those elements are nitrogen, boron, hydrogen, silicon, phosphorus, nickel, cobalt and perhaps sulfur. Manganese and tungsten have been unambiguously detected in diamond, but they might originate from foreign inclusions. Detection of isolated iron in diamond has later been re-interpreted in terms of micro-particles of ruby produced during the diamond synthesis. Oxygen is believed to be a major impurity in diamond, but it has not been spectroscopically identified in diamond yet. Two electron paramagnetic resonance centers (OK1 and N3) have been assigned to nitrogen–oxygen complexes. However, the assignment is indirect and the corresponding concentrations are rather low (few parts per million).N ENDOR of the OK1 centre in natural type Ib diamond | journal = Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter | volume = 1 | issue = 51 | pages = 10549 | year = 1989 | pmc = |bibcode = 1989JPCM....110549N }} ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental data}} {{and analysis of}} the structural damage caused by swift-heavy ion irradiation of single-crystal diamond. The patterned buried structural damage is shown to generate, via swelling, a mirror-pattern on the sample surface, which remains largely damage-free. While extensive results are available for light <b>ion</b> <b>implantations,</b> this effect is reported {{here for the first time}} in the heavy ion regime, where a completely different range of input parameters (in terms of ion species, energy, stopping power, etc.) is available for customized irradiation. The chosen ion species are Au and Br, in the energy range 10 - 40 MeV. The observed patterns, as characterized by profilometry and atomic force microscopy, are reported in a series of model experiments, which show swelling patterns ranging from a few nm to above 200 nm. Moreover, a systematic phenomenological modelling is presented, in which surface swelling measurements are correlated to buried crystal damage. A comparison is made with data for light <b>ion</b> <b>implantations,</b> showing good compatibility with the proposed models. The modelling presented in this work can be useful for the design and realization of micropatterned surfaces in single crystal diamond, allowing to generate highly customized structures by combining appropriately chosen irradiation parameters and masks.
