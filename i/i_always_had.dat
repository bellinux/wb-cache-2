They don't even have to have been there, but if they do, they understand even better. Here in prison they were with me a lot. They came every night, whether I wanted them to or not. Before the trial I could still chase them away when they wanted to come.|$|E

500|$|Creators Murphy and Falchuk {{began working}} on American Horror Story before their Fox series Glee began production. Murphy {{wanted to do the}} {{opposite}} of what he had done previously and thus began his work on the series. He stated, [...] "I went from Nip/Tuck to Glee, so it made sense that I wanted to do something challenging and dark. And <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> loved, as Brad had, the horror genre. So it just was a natural for me." [...] Falchuk was intrigued by the idea of putting a different angle on the horror genre, stating that their main goal in creating the series was to scare viewers. [...] "You want people {{to be a little bit}} off balance afterwards," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|The episode—whose title means [...] "I wish" [...] in French—was {{written and}} {{directed}} by long-time X-Files contributor Vince Gilligan. Gilligan noted that, [...] "from the very beginning <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> the intention of directing an episode, but I kept putting it off because I figured I didn't know enough." [...] Gilligan, however, soon learned directing techniques from his four-and-a-half years of experience on the show. As season seven neared its end and the rumors that the season would be the show's last, Gilligan decided to finally direct an episode. After approaching series creator Chris Carter, an episode set to be {{written and directed}} by Gilligan was green-lit. Initially, Gilligan's first script was a [...] "stark and scary" [...] outing for the show. However, as the deadline for the script grew closer, he relented and decided to write a more humorous episode.|$|E

500|$|Hill contributed {{her voice}} to the soundtrack for What Happened, Miss Simone?, a 2015 {{documentary}} {{about the life of}} Nina Simone, an American singer, pianist, and civil rights activist. Hill was originally supposed to record only two songs for the record, but ended up recording six. She also served as a producer on the compilation alongside Robert Glasper. Hill said of her connection to Simone: [...] "Because I fed on this music ... I believed <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> a right to have a voice. Her example is clearly a form of sustenance to a generation needing to find theirs. What a gift." [...] NPR critically praised Hill's performance on the soundtrack, stating: [...] "This album mainly showcases Lauryn Hill's breadth and dexterity. Not formally marketed as Hill's comeback album, her six tracks here make this her most comprehensive set of studio recordings since The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill in 1998." ...|$|E
500|$|Cheryl is {{introduced}} as an emotionally fragile woman, who pines for the affection of Archer. As the series began to progress, the character abandons her depressive characteristics and adopts a more maniacal and unstable personality. [...] "It was really {{fun to see}} her evolve," [...] Greer asserted, [...] "and I think [...] and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> fun recording together. I'm so thankful that it got so crazy and turned so upside down, and how nuts this character is. It's so fun." [...] Her instability has regularly resulted in Cheryl being sent into mental institutions. She is often sexually aroused from being choked. Commentators have described Cheryl as [...] "", [...] "insane", [...] "glue-chugging", and [...] "empty-headed". Throughout much of the first season, the character frequently developed aliases for herself to acquiesce to her coworkers; these aliases include Cristal, an homage to the alcoholic beverage of the same name, and Cariña, which she professed [...] "better captured [...] sensual womanhood".|$|E

Then, I told my friend Joe, who did the art. He always had an obsession with Marie Antoinette too. She was also decapitated. We also thought about Jayne Mansfield, just {{the idea of a}} woman having her mouth and eyes and ears taken away from her. And, hand grenades, the top comes off. You just pull out the pin and it explodes. So, if you take away someone's mouth and their eyes and their senses and their brain, they explode. I saw a grenade in my head, I saw taking out the clip, and then I thought of a human body and what happens if you take out the clip." ...|$|E

He also said he felt [...] "kind of trapped in that material" [...] {{and that there was}} [...] "no way out". He also admitted to a post-ceremony fight on Twitter with longtime Oscars writer Bruce Vilanch. When Vilanch intimated that the busy actor appeared less than fully committed to the job, Franco posted a photo {{of the two of them}} together graffiti-ed saying [...] "James Fucked up the oscars. Trust me, I KNOW comedy. I mean, come on, I write for Bette Midler". Franco explained to Playboy that [...] "I personally do not do my best thinking when I'm angry.

500|$|Guitarist John Frusciante and bassist Flea wrote much of [...] "Give It Away" [...] during jam {{sessions}} {{in the early}} 1990s. Following the Chili Peppers' tour in support of Mother's Milk (1989), the duo spent time in a side project called H.A.T.E. with members of Fishbone. During their tenure in the group, the guitarist and bassist created the main riff and accompanying bassline for [...] "Give It Away". The rhythm was played at several H.A.T.E. performances shortly thereafter, but when the side project disbanded Frusciante and Flea believed the track would be appropriate for the Chili Peppers' upcoming record. Vocalist Anthony Kiedis agreed, and upon hearing {{the rest of the}} Chili Peppers play the song he began chanting [...] "give it away, give it away, give it away now". The phrase had been something the vocalist intended to incorporate into a song for the band's new record, {{but it was not until}} he heard the bassline that the lyrics fit. Kiedis said, [...] "I was so struck by Flea's bass part, which covered the whole length of the instrument's neck, that I jumped up and marched over to the mic, my notebook in tow. <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> fragments of songs and ideas or even specific isolated phrases in mind." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{waiting for}} Lasers to be released, Fiasco {{completed}} another album, titled [...] [...] He was unsure if the Food and Liquor II {{would ever be}} released, though he released the song [...] "Go To Sleep" [...] from the record [...] "out of desperation" [...] to put out new music. He also pursued numerous side projects {{in the midst of}} the delay. [...] In April 2010, Fiasco formed the hip hop collective All City Chess Club along with Pharrell, Asher Roth, B.o.B, The Cool Kids, Charles Hamilton, Blu, Diggy Simmons, Wale, J. Cole, & Dosage. [...] The group has so far made one song, a remix of Fiasco's [...] "I'm Beamin". [...] Additionally, On July 16, 2010, Fiasco released his rock side-project Japanese Cartoon's debut EP In The Jaws of the Lords of Death. Japanese Cartoon was influenced by a variety of musical genres, with Fiasco saying, [...] "I've always been a fan of all music...Hip hop is just something I actually know how to do but <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> aspirations to participate in other forms of music. Once I got to create some hip hop, it was like, 'Okay, what am I going to do now?' So my artistic side was like, 'Yo, let's do some rock music.'" ...|$|E

500|$|The Phantom Tollbooth {{contains}} {{allusions to}} many works, including those loved by Juster {{in his own}} upbringing. Some of Juster's favorite books as a child, including The Wind in the Willows, had endpaper maps; Juster insisted on one, over Feiffer's opposition, {{going so far as}} to sketch one and require that his collaborator reproduce it in his own style. Juster was also inspired by his father Samuel's love of puns, with which the book is more than sprinkled. In his childhood, Juster spent much time listening to the radio. According to Juster, the need to envision the action when listening to radio serials helped inspire The Phantom Tollbooth, as well as yielding the character of Tock, based on sidekick Jim Fairfield from Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy. Jim gave Tock his wisdom, courage, and adventurous spirit. As a child, Juster had synesthesia, and could only do arithmetic by making associations between numbers and colors. He remembered that the condition affected word associations. [...] "One of the things I always did was think literally when I heard words. On the Lone Ranger [...] they would say, 'Here come the Injuns!' and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> an image of engines, of train engines." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{a role as}} the Bostonian love {{interest}} of Cornel Wilde in Humberstone's The Homestretch (1947), O'Hara had grown frustrated with Hollywood and took a considerable break {{to return to her}} native Ireland, where people thought she did not look well, having lost a lot of weight. While there she received a call from 20th Century Fox to portray the role of Doris Walker, the mother of Susan Walker (played by a young Natalie Wood) in the Christmas film, Miracle on 34th Street (1947). It became a perennial Christmas classic, with a traditional network television airing every Thanksgiving Day on NBC. On Natalie Wood, O'Hara said: [...] "I have been mother to almost forty children in movies, but <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> a special place in my heart for little Natalie. She always called me Mamma Maureen and I called her Natasha... when Natalie and I shot the scenes in Macy's, we had to do them at night because the store was full of people doing their Christmas shopping during the day. Natalie loved this because it meant she was allowed to stay up late. I really enjoyed this time with Natalie. We loved to walk through the quiet, closed store and look at all the toys and girls' dresses and shoes. The day she died, I cried shamelessly". The film garnered several awards, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture.|$|E
500|$|Although jams {{had always}} been an {{integral}} aspect of song creation for the Chili Peppers, Blood Sugar Sex Magik saw songs being created with more structure. One specific jam {{would lead to the}} breakout song on the album: Frusciante, Flea and Smith were all playing together—with Kiedis at another part of the room watching—when [...] "...Flea started playing this insane bass line, and Chad cracked up and played along... <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> fragments of song ideas or even specific isolated phrases in my mind. I (Kiedis) took the mic and belted out 'Give it away, give it away, give it away, give it away now." [...] The philosophy behind the lyrics originated from a conversation Kiedis had with Nina Hagen, regarding selflessness and how insignificant material possessions were in his life. It, thus, gave birth to the song [...] "Give It Away." [...] He'd also been reminiscing about late Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak, composing [...] "My Lovely Man" [...] in his tribute. Kiedis wrote [...] "Sir Psycho Sexy" [...] to be an over-zealous and overly exaggerated version of himself; a figure that could get any woman, and do anything he pleased to them. [...] "The Power of Equality" [...] confronted topics concerning racial equality, prejudice and sexism. Kiedis wrote [...] "I Could Have Lied" [...] to document the brief relationship he had with Irish singer Sinéad O'Connor.|$|E

500|$|McCain {{was almost}} killed on board Forrestal on July 29, 1967. [...] While the air wing was {{preparing}} to launch attacks, a Zuni rocket from an F-4 Phantom accidentally fired across the carrier's deck. [...] The rocket struck either McCain's A-4E Skyhawk or one near it. The impact ruptured the Skyhawk's fuel tank, which ignited the fuel and knocked two bombs loose. [...] McCain later said, [...] "I thought my aircraft exploded. Flames were everywhere." [...] McCain escaped from his jet by climbing out of the cockpit, working himself to {{the nose of the}} jet, and jumping off its refueling probe onto the burning deck. His flight suit caught on fire as he rolled through the flames, but he was able to put it out. [...] He went to help another pilot trying to escape the fire when the first bomb exploded; McCain was thrown backwards ten feet (three meters) and suffered minor wounds when struck in the legs and chest by fragments. McCain helped crewmen throw unexploded bombs overboard off the hangar deck elevator, then went to Forrestals ready room and with other pilots watched the ensuing fire and the fire-fighting efforts on the room's closed-circuit television. The fire killed 134sailors, injured scores of others, destroyed at least 20aircraft, and took 24hours to control. [...] In Saigon a day after the conflagration, McCain praised the heroism of enlisted men who gave their lives trying to save the pilots on deck, and told New York Times reporter R. W. Apple, Jr., [...] "It's a difficult thing to say. But now that I've seen what the bombs and the napalm did to the people on our ship, I'm not so sure that I want to drop any more of that stuff on North Vietnam." [...] But such a change of course was unlikely; as McCain added, [...] "I always {{wanted to be in the}} Navy. I was born into it and I never really considered another profession. But <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>had</b> trouble with the regimentation." ...|$|E

The series had about 25,000 cels per episode instead of the standard 10,000, making it unique in that characters moved more fluidly.
