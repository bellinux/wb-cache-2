5|$|Among {{the extreme}} trans-Neptunian objects are two high {{perihelion}} objects: Sedna and 2012 VP113. Sedna and 2012 VP113 are distant detached objects with perihelia greater than 70 AU. Their high perihelia keep {{them at a}} sufficient distance to avoid significant gravitational perturbations from Neptune. Previous <b>explanations</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> high perihelion of Sedna include a close encounter with an unknown planet on a distant orbit and a distant encounter with a random star {{or a member of}} the Sun's birth cluster that passed near the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Haynes and Leary {{published}} the magazine Strange V.D., which featured photos of abnormal medical ailments, coupled with fictitious, humorous <b>explanations</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> diseases. After being caught {{with one of}} these pictures at work, Haynes left the accounting firm and moved to Southern California. Leary, at the time one semester shy of his degree, dropped out of college and followed Haynes. After a brief period spent selling homemade clothes and linens emblazoned with Lee Harvey Oswald's image, the pair returned to San Antonio, and launched the band that would eventually become Butthole Surfers.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the clustering of the perihelia and the orbital poles of distant objects, Planet Nine offers <b>explanations</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> high perihelion of Sedna and , for objects with orbits roughly perpendicular {{to those of the}} planets, for high inclination TNOs with semi-major axes less than 100 AU, and for the tilt of the Sun's rotation axis. The objects it dynamically controls would form a cloud centered on its semi-major axis {{with a wide range of}} inclinations.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the work}} of Henry of Huntingdon, who wrote {{in the years before}} 1154 and who {{regarded}} Stephen's actions as treachery against the clergy that earned him punishment from God, Alexander's arrest has been seen by many historians as a turning point in Stephen's reign. Writing in the 1870s, the historian William Stubbs felt that the arrest destroyed the royal administration, but modern historians have advanced differing <b>explanations</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> troubles that followed, not all of which are related to the bishop's arrest.|$|E
5|$|When {{trying to}} explain past phenomena, paleontologists and other {{historical}} scientists often construct a set of hypotheses about the causes and then look for a smoking gun, a {{piece of evidence that}} indicates that one hypothesis is a better explanation than others. Sometimes the smoking gun is discovered by a fortunate accident during other research. For example, the discovery by Luis Alvarez and Walter Alvarez of an iridium-rich layer at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary made asteroid impact and volcanism the most favored <b>explanations</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.|$|E

5|$|Common public <b>explanations</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> college's closure include student radicalism, lack of discipline, {{administrative}} issues, {{and financial}} issues. The Nations Eliseo Vivas blamed {{its lack of}} grades as detrimental to student incentive, and judged the effort to create self-motivated students through freedom to be a failure. In School and Society, Professor Grant Showerman also credited the college's freedoms and lack of compulsions with its demise. Proponents of the Experimental College painted it as the foil of a conservative, standard college, and blamed educational stagnation on the existing order. Meiklejohn believed in a liberal education's power to change society through imagining alternatives to the status quo. He aimed to produce students who could counterbalance society with independence of thought, but admitted {{that he did not}} know how to facilitate this.|$|E
5|$|Doggett {{returns to}} the X-Files office, where, to his surprise, he meets The Lone Gunmen. They {{tell him about the}} history of the third eye. While coming to the same conclusion, they are {{convinced}} that Tipet is projecting himself into people's dreams and killing them there. Returning to the warehouse where they found Bormanis, Skinner and Doggett meet Tipet, who is trying to take his own life by pushing his head through a table saw. They rush him to the hospital, where Doggett by surprise finds Scully's name on the register. With Tipet in a coma, Kersh decides to pull the plug on the case, saying they've found the main suspect. But Doggett and Skinner are not satisfied, saying there are no <b>explanations</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> various murders and events surrounding the case.|$|E
5|$|Japanese naval staff {{officers}} {{gathered in}} Manila in June {{to analyze the}} Take Ichi convoy. The officers believed that Japan's communication codes were secure and discussed alternative <b>explanations</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> convoy's detection. These explanations included the increase in radio signals {{at the time the}} convoy sailed being detected by Allied radio traffic analysts, a Japanese officer in Manila accidentally divulging information and Allied spies working on the Manila waterfront radioing messages about the convoy's composition and departure. The meeting concluded that Allied spies were responsible for the convoy's detection, and the Japanese military's codes were not changed.|$|E

5|$|Most {{people like}} themselves; {{the name is}} {{associated}} with the self, and hence the letters of the name are preferred, {{despite the fact that they}} appear in many other words. People who do not like themselves tend not to exhibit the name-letter effect. A similar effect has been found for numbers related to birthdays: people tend to prefer the number signifying the day of the month on which they were born. Alternative <b>explanations</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> name-letter effect, such as frequent exposure and early mastery, have been ruled out. In psychological assessments, the Name Letter Preference Task is widely used to estimate implicit self-esteem.|$|E
5|$|New Keynesians offered <b>explanations</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{failure of}} the labor market to clear. In a Walrasian market, {{unemployed}} workers bid down wages until the demand for workers meets the supply. If markets are Walrasian, the ranks of the unemployed would be limited to workers transitioning between jobs and workers who choose not to work because wages are too low to attract them. They developed several theories explaining why markets might leave willing workers unemployed. Of these theories, new Keynesians were especially associated with efficiency wages and the insider-outsider model used to explain long-term effects of previous unemployment, where short-term increases in unemployment become permanent and lead to higher levels of unemployment in the long-run.|$|E
5|$|Parasaurolophus was a hadrosaurid, part of {{a diverse}} family of Cretaceous dinosaurs known for their range of bizarre head adornments. This genus {{is known for its}} large, {{elaborate}} cranial crest, which at its largest forms a long curved tube projecting upwards and back from the skull. Charonosaurus from China, which may have been its closest relative, had a similar skull and potentially a similar crest. Visual recognition of both species and sex, acoustic resonance, and thermoregulation have been proposed as functional <b>explanations</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> crest. It is one of the rarer hadrosaurids, known from only a handful of good specimens.|$|E
