5|$|After basic <b>design</b> <b>work</b> was {{completed}} on the Tu-4 bomber, Tupolev decided {{to design a}} passenger variant with a pressurized fuselage, given the internal designation of Tu-70. It was intended to use as many Tu-4 components as possible to reduce cost and save development time. It was a low-wing, cantilever monoplane with tricycle landing gear, powered by four Shvetsov ASh-73TK radial engines. <b>Design</b> <b>work</b> on a mockup began in February 1946 and the Council of Ministers confirmed an order for a single prototype the following month. A production decision for the Tu-12, {{as it was to}} be known, would be made after testing.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{current study}} is to explore and develop {{a model for the}} {{evaluation}} of graphic <b>design</b> <b>works.</b> A total of 25 graphic <b>design</b> <b>works</b> constituting with five circles in different sizes and locations were assessed with 75 designers in 10 evaluation criteria of graphic design by a 9 -point scale system. A factor analysis was used {{to reduce the number of}} evaluation criteria. The two crucial criteria (balance and contrast) explaining 57. 6 % of the variance was derived from the 25 graphic <b>design</b> <b>works.</b> In order to test the evaluating validity of graphic <b>design</b> <b>works</b> with the scores of balance and contrast, another set of 25 logo <b>design</b> <b>works</b> were evaluated with 21 designers in the two criteria and in a overall scores. A multiple linear regression analysis using the stepwise method was conducted to predict the design scores with the two crucial criteria. The result indicates that the regression equation has a highly predicting power to the design scores based on the two crucial criteria (R 2 = 0. 518) ...|$|R

5|$|<b>Design</b> <b>work</b> on the Type 34-class destroyers {{began in}} 1932, {{around the time}} that Weimar Germany renounced the {{armament}} limitations of the Versailles Treaty that had ended World War I. Initial designs were for large ships {{more powerful than the}} French and Polish destroyers then in service, but the design grew as the Kriegsmarine now expected it to serve as a small cruiser. The <b>design</b> <b>work</b> appears to have been rushed and not well-thought out as the short forecastle and lack of flare at the bow compromised the ships' seakeeping ability and their stability was inadequate. The only real innovative part of the design, the high-pressure boilers, were an over-complicated design that received almost no shipboard testing before being installed in the Type 34s and frequently broke down throughout the life of the ships.|$|E

5|$|In February 1959, Hawker had {{completed}} practically {{all of the}} <b>design</b> <b>work</b> and thus passed the entirety of its manufacturing <b>design</b> <b>work</b> to the company's Experimental Design Office at Kingston, London. In April 1959, the Ministry of Supply formally issued a contract for {{the completion of a}} pair of P.1127 prototypes. However, there were critics amongst the Air Staff of the project, typically disliking the P.1127 for its subsonic speeds, favouring supersonic-capable aircraft instead; Mason attributes this as having caused considerable delay in the issuing of a contract to Hawker. On 23 July 1959, Hawker authorised the application of maximum effort to complete the development of the P.1127.|$|E
5|$|The <b>design</b> <b>work</b> was {{supported}} by a preceding research programme studying the flight characteristics of low ratio delta wings. A supersonic Fairey Delta 2 was modified to carry the ogee planform, and, renamed as the BAC 221, used for flight tests of the high speed flight envelope, the Handley Page HP.115 also provided valuable information on low speed performance.|$|E

5|$|A 1990 CDOT design {{proposal}} for a new bridge was dropped after heavy opposition.

CDOT expedited the planning process for the bridge and work began the next year. Construction of the segmental concrete box-girder replacement was complicated by the need to protect the wetlands below, a problem that was solved by building the bridge from the top down and taking measures to allow the concrete piers to be poured and dried during winter.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} Holden's early designs were for hospitals, which Adams' {{practice}} specialised in.

5|$|<b>Design</b> <b>work</b> for a {{new class}} of battleships started about two weeks after the {{launching}} of , an , which took place on April 30, 1904. By the end of July 1905, the Austrian Commander in Chief of the Navy, Admiral Monteccuccoli, laid out his vision for an expanded Austro-Hungarian fleet. This included 12 battleships, four armored cruisers, eight scout cruisers, 18 destroyers, 36 large torpedo boats, and six submarines. A navy design board evaluated five designs for the new battleship type between September 25–29, 1905.|$|E

5|$|<b>Design</b> <b>work</b> on {{the class}} began in 1892 and lasted until 1894. The ships of the Kaiser Friedrich III class marked a {{significant}} {{departure from the}} previous s. Influenced by the Japanese cruisers' victory over a heavier-armed Chinese fleet at the Battle of Yalu, heavy-caliber guns designed to penetrate armor were abandoned and replaced with smaller quick-firing guns. These guns were intended to raze the superstructure of enemy battleships and demoralize the crew. The propulsion system was improved and reorganized to incorporate a third propeller shaft. The armor system, however, remained similar to that employed on the Brandenburgs.|$|E
