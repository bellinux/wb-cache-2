40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{investigate}} the knowledge, attitudes and practical behaviour of pharmacy workers in Nordland County of Norway concerning the use of <b>HPs</b> <b>and</b> DS by dementia patients. Hundred and five pharmacy workers responded to the electronic questionnaire. 98 % of the pharmacy workers have received questions about the <b>HPs</b> <b>and</b> DS. The pharmacy workers used different sources to get knowledge <b>and</b> information about <b>HPs</b> <b>and</b> DS The results of the survey indicate that 17 % of pharmacy workers check the possible drug-HPs and DS interactions as a routine. But, 91 % percent supply information on drug-HPs and DS interaction and side effects of <b>HPs</b> <b>and</b> DS at least sometimes. The knowledge of pharmacy workers about <b>HPs</b> <b>and</b> DS as a whole needs to be improved. There is a lack of product independent information and also availability of information about <b>HPs</b> <b>and</b> DS in most of the pharmacies in Nordland county of Norway. Pharmacy workers in Nordland County do not routinely document or monitor dementia patients’ use of DS <b>and</b> <b>HPs.</b> Furthermore, most of the pharmacy workers believe that general practitioners have a very important role as safety provider for dementia patients and see themselves less responsible...|$|R
40|$|Very {{accurate}} non-Born–Oppenheimer variational {{calculations of}} the ground state of e 1 LiH have been performed using explicitly correlated Gaussian functions with preexponential factors dependent on powers of the internuclear distance. In {{order to determine the}} positron detachment energy of e 1 LiH and the dissociation energy corresponding to the e 1 LiH fragmentation into <b>HPs</b> <b>and</b> Li 1 we also calculated non-BO energies of <b>HPs,</b> LiH, <b>and</b> Li 1. For all the systems the calculations provided the lowest ever-reported variational upper-bounds to the ground state energies. Annihilation rates of <b>HPs</b> <b>and</b> e 1 LiH were also computed.

5|$|Recognizing {{that the}} lack of {{software}} could be a serious problem for the future, Intel made thousands of these early systems available to independent software vendors (ISVs) to stimulate development. <b>HP</b> <b>and</b> Intel brought the next-generation Itanium2 processor to market a year later.|$|E
5|$|Capturing Pokémon {{is another}} {{essential}} element of the gameplay. During a battle with a wild Pokémon, the player may throw a Poké Ball at it. If the Pokémon is successfully caught, it will come under the ownership of the player. Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP of the target Pokémon {{and the type of}} Poké Ball used: the lower the target's <b>HP</b> <b>and</b> the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture.|$|E

5|$|HP {{believed}} that it was no longer cost-effective for individual enterprise systems companies such as itself to develop proprietary microprocessors, so it partnered with Intel in 1994 to develop the IA-64 architecture, derived from EPIC. Intel was willing to undertake a very large development effort on IA-64 in the expectation that the resulting microprocessor would be used by the majority of enterprise systems manufacturers. <b>HP</b> <b>and</b> Intel initiated a large joint development effort with a goal of delivering the first product, Merced, in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Mithra: The Mithra are a race {{of hunters}} who live {{alongside}} the Tarutaru in Windurst. They {{are known for their}} energy, curiosity, and their penchant for causing playful mischief. Due to a gender imbalance in their race males are a rarity, and so only female mithra leave the home, making females the only playable gender. Mithra possess high dexterity and agility, but lower <b>HP</b> <b>and</b> charisma. Mithra are cursed with envy.|$|E
5|$|The Itanium 2 {{processor}} {{was released}} in 2002, and was marketed for enterprise servers rather than for the whole gamut of high-end computing. The first Itanium2, code-named McKinley, was jointly developed by <b>HP</b> <b>and</b> Intel. It relieved many of the performance problems of the original Itanium processor, which were mostly caused by an inefficient memory subsystem. McKinley contains 221 million transistors (of which 25 million are for logic), measured 19.5mm by 21.6mm (421mm2) and was fabricated in a 180nm, bulk CMOS process with six layers of aluminium metallization.|$|E
40|$|NHIK 3025 cells {{derived from}} a {{carcinoma}} in situ were exposed to hematoporphyrin derivative (<b>Hpd)</b> <b>and</b> light and examined by light microscopy, freeze-etching, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy. The first morphologic changes observed were shrinkage of mitochondria and formation of vesicles on the cell membrane. Furthermore, increased membrane permeability led to accumulation of <b>Hpd</b> <b>and</b> cellular swelling, with a concomitant {{reduction in the number}} and size of the microvilli. Some of the vesicles seemed to originate from microvilli. The freeze-etching appearance of the membranes {{of the majority of the}} cells was unaltered by treatment with <b>Hpd</b> <b>and</b> light. However, in some cases clustering of membrane particles was observed. At low doses membrane vesiculation and cell swelling were reversed within a few hours after treatment, indicating that repair processes were operative...|$|R
40|$|This {{preliminary}} {{clinical and}} radiographic {{study examined the}} survival of, the marginal bone loss (MBL) around, {{and the influence of}} prosthetic abutment height (AH) on MBL around hybrid implants placed in two groups of partially edentulous patients: healthy (<b>HPs)</b> <b>and</b> periodontally compromised (PCPs) patients. A total of 93 patients requiring single or multiunit implant restoration, in the mandible or maxilla, were treated while undergoing cement-retained prosthetic restoration. A total of 54 implants (35 in the maxilla and 19 in the mandible) were placed in 45 <b>HPs,</b> <b>and</b> 56 implants (31 in the maxilla and 25 in the mandible) in 48 PCPs. All 110 hybrid implants positioned in pristine bone provided a 100 % survival rate in both <b>HPs</b> <b>and</b> PCPs. No statistical differences were recorded comparing the MBL values of maxillae with those of mandibles. In <b>HPs</b> <b>and</b> PCPs, a similar and limited amount of MBL was recorded, and {{it was found that the}} higher the AH, the less MBL. In conclusion, results indicate that the hybrid implants examined could reduce the risk of peri-implantitis due to their coronal machined surfaces and improve osseointegration due to their apical rough surfaces...|$|R

5|$|Within certain conditions, {{characters}} {{can perform}} Special Moves, customizable powerful moves tied to Jobs: after a Special Move is performed, the entire party is granted buffs {{for a limited}} period. This period is represented with a specific tune that plays over normal battle music. Various elements {{can be added to}} Special Moves, such as granting elemental properties, launching status ailments at enemies, recovering <b>HP</b> <b>and</b> MP, and temporary status ailment immunity to the party. The customization of Special Moves is directly tied to the creation of specialist shops during the reconstruction of Norende. Experience points acquired {{at the end of a}} battle enable characters and their assigned Jobs to level up, unlocking new abilities and boosting character stats such as available <b>HP</b> <b>and</b> MP. Bonuses are gained if the party fulfilled certain conditions. Job abilities and levels can also be borrowed from online friends, in a feature called Abilink. Any Job can be borrowed from available players regardless of their current level.|$|E
5|$|Apart from battling, {{capturing}} Pokémon is {{the most}} essential element of Pokémon gameplay. During battle with a wild Pokémon (other trainers' Pokémon cannot be captured), the player may use a Poké Ball on the wild Pokémon. If successful, the Pokémon {{will be added to}} the player's active party (or stored if the player already has the maximum six Pokémon in his/her party). Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP (and/or status effects such as Paralysis or Sleep,) of the target Pokémon and the strength of the Poké Ball used: the lower the target's <b>HP</b> <b>and</b> the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture is.|$|E
5|$|Apart from battling, {{capturing}} Pokémon is {{the most}} important element of Pokémon gameplay. Although other trainers' Pokémon cannot be captured, the player can use different kinds of Poké Balls on a wild Pokémon during battle. A successful capture adds the Pokémon to the player's active party or stores it if the player already has the maximum of six Pokémon. Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP of the target Pokémon and the strength of the Poké Ball used; the lower the target's <b>HP</b> <b>and</b> the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture is. Also, inflicting certain status effects such as sleep or paralysis add a multiplier to the capture rate, making it easier to capture wild Pokémon. Each species has a capture rate of its own as well.|$|E

40|$|AIMS: To {{compare the}} {{molecular}} {{profile of a}} series of sessile serrated adenomas (SSAs) <b>and</b> hyperplastic polyps (<b>HPs),</b> in order to distinguish these lesions, SSAs having a potential role in the genesis of serrated adenocarcinomas through a serrated pathway in which methylation plays a key role. METHODS <b>AND</b> RESULTS: Twelve <b>HPs</b> <b>and</b> sixteen SSAs of the right and left colon were investigated for microsatellite instability, DNA mismatch repair genes, p 53, p 16, and beta-catenin expression, MLH 1 and p 16 (CDKN 2 A) gene methylation, and KRAS and BRAF mutations. Both SSAs <b>and</b> <b>HPs</b> were microsatellite stable. MLH 1 and MSH 2 protein silencing, aberrant cytoplasmic expression and methylation of p 16 were found to be exclusive to right-sided SSAs. The MLH 1 promoter gene was frequently methylated in right-sided SSAs in contrast with HPs. Abnormal p 53 and beta-catenin expression was present in both SSAs <b>and</b> <b>HPs.</b> BRAF <b>and</b> KRAS mutation were mutually exclusive, but KRAS mutation was present only in left-sided SSAs <b>and</b> <b>HPs.</b> CONCLUSIONS: <b>HPs</b> <b>and</b> SSAs may be related lesions. However, at least right-sided SSAs differ from left-sided SSAs <b>and</b> <b>HPs</b> in the occurrence of MLH 1 and p 16 methylation, supporting the hypothesis that SSAs could be precursors of serrated adenocarcinomas...|$|R

5|$|Risk is an {{essential}} element in the battle system. A Risk bar is placed below the <b>HP</b> <b>and</b> MP bar, representing the Risk Points the player has accumulated. Risk Points affect Ashley's concentration; the longer Ashley attacks a target, the more his Risk Point accumulates — lowering his accuracy and defenses. Chain and Defensive Abilities increase Risk faster than regular attacks, while Break Arts do not increase Risk at all. Enemy attacks and spells deal more damage if the player has high Risk. The advantage, however, is the higher chances for the player to score critical hits and restore higher HP.|$|E
5|$|Bravely Default is a {{role-playing}} game (RPG) {{which features}} a party of four characters navigating the fantasy world of Luxendarc. Navigation in towns, dungeons and the world map environments are done from an angled, third-person overhead view: the character remains still, the camera zooms out to a distant view. These environments are displayed on the top screen of the Nintendo 3DS system, while the bottom screen displays maps of environments, party stats and other information such as item menus. On the world map, a day-night cycle alters the types of enemies present, and after {{a certain point in}} the story an airship can be used to speed up travel and access previously inaccessible areas. In towns, players can interact with non-playable characters (NPCs), purchase items or magic at specialized shops, buy or sell weapons and equipment at an armory, or rest at an inn to restore health points (<b>HP)</b> <b>and</b> magic points (MP). In all environments, the party can find chests containing items, weapons or equipment. During certain points, a Party Chat option appears, giving players the option of initiating conversations between the party members. During exploration, standard enemies appear through random encounters: outside battle, the counter rate can be adjusted from high to nothing. The game features multiple difficulty levels, which can be adjusted freely outside battle.|$|E
5|$|Characters {{have several}} {{different}} stats and gauges: their health (HP), a magic meter stocked by Technical Points (TP), and Learning Points (LP) for learning skills. a character's respective agility or luck, {{and how a}} character reacts to attacks. Attack types are physical and magical, while defense is limited to physical attacks. Characters gain experience levels through accumulating experience points (EXP). EXP and Gald is earned through battles, along with recovering a degree of TP and occasionally items dropped by defeated enemies. Skills, attributes that change different stats, can be assigned to each character. The number of skills that can be assigned is calculated {{by the number of}} skill points each character has available. Battling with equipment associated with a particular skill enables that character to learn it when they have filled their LP meter. Cooking, creating meals with ingredients found in battle or around explored environments, can also be used by individual characters to restore their <b>HP</b> <b>and</b> TP and grant temporary enhancements. Recipes are learned from a character called the Wonder Chef.|$|E
