500|$|John Fleming and Colin McWilliam are in {{agreement}} that Adam was at <b>his</b> <b>best</b> as a collaborator.

He and Monk have been good friends since Monk was on the police force, and he {{continues}} to be Monk's friend throughout the series. He <b>does</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> to help Monk but is occasionally annoyed by Monk's phobias and the damage they can cause. In the first two seasons, Stottlemeyer is reluctant to work with Monk, seemingly annoyed by the idea that he could not handle his cases himself. By seasons three and four, his faith in Monk's contribution is well-cemented and his collaboration unquestionable.|$|E

500|$|Of the film's humor, Wilmington {{wrote that}} Leprechaun [...] "isn't {{dumb enough to}} be fun". [...] Hicks {{described}} the film's humor as [...] "ill-advised slapstick", and Canby wrote that it is [...] "neither scary nor funny". [...] Berardinelli called the leprechaun's one-liners [...] "more idiotic than pithy". [...] Writing in the Chicago Sun-Times, critic Jeff Makos unfavorably compared the film's tone to that of Tremors, which he posited as an influence. [...] Makos said Davis <b>does</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> to be funny, but the film has no funny jokes, making audience feedback probably more entertaining than the film itself. [...] The use of Lucky Charms as humor also received commentary. [...] Harrington wrote that Jones is [...] "so bereft of inventive ideas that he refers to Lucky Charms cereal not once but three times", and Bourjaily criticized the Lucky Charms jokes as unfunny.|$|E

500|$|To {{prepare for}} the role, Collins read the Book of Revelation. As well, Collins has said he {{somewhat}} based his character around his younger brother, who has something [...] "angelic about him", as he [...] "has this way of, very calmly, just staring into someone's eyes" [...] making one feel [...] "like he can get into your soul." [...] To avoid the biblically toned dialogue from sounding too [...] "campy", Collins <b>does</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> to [...] "play it as real as possible". Because Castiel's true voice shattered windows in his premiere episode, Collins decided to use a [...] "gruff, resonant voice" [...] for the character. However, when portraying the angel's host Jimmy Novak, he tried to create {{a distinction between the}} two characters, providing different physical and personality traits, as well as using a [...] "more boyish kind of sound" [...] for Jimmy's voice.|$|E
500|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) convinces Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) that {{he should}} {{approach}} Katy and if all else fails, he should buy a purse, which he does to Pam and Jim's delight. When Michael hears she'll need a ride home, he <b>does</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> to offer himself, {{going so far as}} to spend the aforementioned $1000 on an espresso machine to impress her. While Pam is sitting on Jim's desk and talking to him, Roy comes up and tries to apologize to Pam, eventually getting her out of her bad mood by tickling her; an uncomfortable Jim leaves his desk. Later, he strikes up a conversation with Katy and in the end she decides to get a ride from Jim, leaving Michael and Dwight devastated. [...] It is revealed that Katy and Jim are also going out for a drink, to the apparent jealousy of Pam.|$|E
500|$|King Richard IV of England and XII of Scotland and his Queen Gertrude of Flanders {{have two}} sons: Harry, Prince of Wales {{and his younger}} brother Prince Edmund. Of the two, Harry is by far his father's favourite, the King barely {{acknowledging}} his second son's existence. It is a running gag throughout the series that Edmund's father cannot even remember his name. However, despite his mostly dismissive attitude toward his second son, the series' finale makes it clear that the King loves Edmund as much as Harry: on Edmund's deathbed, the King <b>does</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> to console him and has the entire court drink a toast in his honour. In the third episode, when Edmund becomes the Archbishop of Canterbury and helps his father to secure some land before the church, the King acknowledges Edmund as his son, embraces him and even mentions to the Queen that he has [...] "turned out well".|$|E

500|$|Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club {{labeled the}} duet as [...] "eminently danceable paean to {{forbidden}} love". Lyrically, the couple proclaims their eternal fealty, make {{out in a}} Lexus and acknowledge {{the world that the}} romantic relationship between them is only their business. According to Billboards reviewer, in lines like [...] "you'll always be the one I want to come home to" [...] and [...] "you'll always be my baby", [...] "it makes the beyond-complicated circumstances of their history impossible to ignore." [...] Stacy-Ann Ellis of Vibe magazine, wrote that the song, like the couple’s first post-makeup collaboration, [...] "Birthday Cake (Remix)", is about the history they share and [...] "refuse to let go of—it’ll irk some people". Digital Spy's Robert Copsey noted that vocally Brown <b>does</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> to achieve a Jackson impression. Robert Leedham of Drowned in Sound stated that [...] "Nobody's Business" [...] "makes you want to write a long, worthy think piece so you can come to terms with your own moral standing on it." ...|$|E
500|$|The player {{assumes the}} role of Yukito Kunisaki, the protagonist of Air. He lives a poor life going {{from town to town}} with little money, {{trying to make a living}} off his show with a puppet. By being an {{adolescent}} or young adult, Yukito sometimes acts childishly if provoked. Yukito tends to be helpful to those around him while trying to earn any money at the same time, and <b>does</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> to look after Misuzu in the Dream arc. Misuzu Kamio, the main heroine of Air, makes Yukito quite mistrustful at first by being too friendly, but eventually earns his affection. She is a cheerful but introverted, slightly clumsy and simplistic high school girl, and often utters the pseudo-dinosauric phrase gao when she feels troubled, a habit she retained from childhood. Misuzu has a great love of dinosaurs, finding the story of their glory and extinction [...] "romantic". As a child, her fascination with dinosaurs stemmed from thinking chicks would grow into them; her adoptive mother Haruko Kamio thinks it is ridiculous.|$|E

[...] Erin Strecker of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Spears' style on the video is similar to her [...] "Stronger" [...] (2000) music video and that will.i.am, [...] "for his part, <b>does</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> to get {{it started with a}} KING crown and plenty of {{technological}} devises, before performing some futuristic slow-mo running and watching approvingly as the back-up dancers party on." [...] Yahoo! Music blogger Wendy Geller wrote that Spears' accent on the song was [...] "terrible", that [...] "her physique is looking undeniably good" [...] on the video, and that Spears [...] "is looking to be in a much, much healthier place than she was the last time she tried to sound all cockney. So she gets a pass in our book." [...] Sadao Turner of RyanSeacrest.com said that the video looked like a Sharper Image Catalog coming to life in a nightclub, and T. Kyle of MTV Buzzworthy wrote that [...] "Scream & Shout' is pure fire, and Britney's parts in the video are...very cool and amazing".|$|E

The film earned a record-breaking $142,839,137 opening weekend and an overall run of $709,827,462 worldwide. Though the film received negative reviews, film critic Michael Phillips from the Chicago Tribune said that Pattinson was still [...] "interesting to watch" [...] despite the bad makeup. Bill GoodyKoontz from the Arizona Republic said that [...] "Pattinson's actually not in the film that much, but he <b>does</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> when he's around" [...] and Michael O'Sullivan of the Washington Post noted that his acting was [...] "uniformly strong".|$|E
2500|$|Socrates invokes a {{comparison}} between athletic competitions and debate. [...] He argues that a runner or wrestler who throws the contest by doing worse than {{he is capable of}} doing is a more skillful combatant than the one who <b>does</b> <b>his</b> <b>best</b> and loses. Socrates multiplies the analogy, adding that, whether it is a singer off key, a gymnast who appears ungraceful, or a man who pretends to be lame, it is always better to have the power to do it right and pretend to do it wrong than to be helpless to do it right.|$|E
