5|$|Peter asks Quagmire {{where he}} heard the dirty joke in the first place, and Quagmire reveals that he <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> from Bruce. Locating Bruce at {{his job at the}} bowling alley, the group discovers that the joke has been {{transmitted}} by a large number of people, and eventually trace it to a Virginia bartender.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{not having}} listened to heavy metal since age 13 or 14 {{in favor of}} new wave, Kijak was {{immediately}} drawn to the band's music, surprised he had never <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> before. He bonded {{with some of the}} band members; learning that Kiss' Love Gun was the first album he, Yoshiki and Toshi had ever bought and talking with Sugizo about the British new wave band Japan and its bassist Mick Karn, who was a friend of the guitarist.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{for the song}} took place at Record Plant Studios, Hollywood, California, and Platinum Sound Recording Studio, New York City by Dave Russell, with Benjamin Rice and Andrew Robertson working as assistants. Russell also did the mixing of the track at Record Plant and at <b>Heard</b> <b>It!</b> Studios. Additional mixing {{was carried out by}} Bill Malina, with assistance from Rice and Ghazi Hourani. Rick Pearl performed the additional programming and Gene Grimaldi completed the audio mastering at Oasis Mastering Studios in Burbank, California.|$|E

60|$|Almost could I tell it in four words. In {{them one}} {{would say that}} it is set forth. There was in London at that time popular a song, a comic, vulgar song of the 'Alls, 'The Cat Came Back'. You 'ave <b>'eard</b> <b>it?</b> Yes? I <b>'eard</b> <b>it</b> myself, and without emotion. It had no {{sinister}} warning for me. It did not strike me as omen. Yet, in those four words, monsieur, is my tragedy.|$|R
5|$|Several of the {{statements}} originated from the juveniles who had been arrested shortly after the murder. They included Jason Hill, the 13-year-old who had been held for three days in his underpants and a blanket, without access to his parents or a lawyer. (Hill received £30,000 in damages from the police over his treatment.) Hill had not been told that his statement {{was going to be}} read out in court during the detectives' trial; he first learned that it had been used when he <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> on television. Another statement was from Mark Pennant, also a juvenile who had been arrested during the first inquiry. Overall it appeared that Silcott was being retried.|$|E
5|$|The {{attempts}} of the Mortaras {{and their allies}} to identify {{who was supposed to}} have baptised Edgardo quickly bore fruit. After their present servant Anna Facchini adamantly denied any involvement, they considered former employees and soon earmarked Morisi as a possible candidate. In late July 1858 the Mortara home was visited by Ginerva Scagliarini, a friend of Morisi's who had once worked for Marianna's brother-in-law Cesare De Angelis. Marianna's brother Angelo Padovani tested Scagliarini by saying falsely that he had <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> was Morisi who had baptised Edgardo. The ruse worked—Scagliarini said that she had been told the same thing by Morisi's sister Monica.|$|E
5|$|The {{four of them}} head to the warehouse, {{where they}} find the gas stored inside asthma inhalers. Suddenly, Mulder arrives to arrest them, but two dark-suited men come to take Susanne. They fire at Mulder, hitting the boxes behind him and exposing him to the gas. The {{exposure}} causes Mulder to strip naked, hide in the box, and hallucinate about seeing aliens in the warehouse. Susanne shoots the men and escapes. More men then arrive, led by X, who intimidates the Lone Gunmen. Byers confronts X, asking him about his actions and mentioning the supposed cover-up of the John F. Kennedy assassination. X's unconvincing denial—"I <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> was a lone gunman"—becomes {{the origin of the}} trio's name. X leaves, just as the police arrive and arrest the Lone Gunmen.|$|E

5|$|The {{silencer}} {{played a}} central role. It was deemed to {{have been on the}} rifle when it was fired, because of the blood found inside it. The prosecution said the blood had come from Sheila's head when the silencer was pointed at her. Had she discovered that she could not shoot herself with the silencer attached, the court <b>heard,</b> <b>it</b> would have been found next to her body; she had no reason to return it to the gun cupboard. That she had carried out the killings was further discounted because, it was argued, she had not recently expressed suicidal thoughts; the expert evidence was that she would not have harmed her children or father; she had no interest in or knowledge of guns; she lacked the strength to overcome her father; and there was no evidence on her clothes or body that she had moved around the crime scene or been involved in a struggle. In particular, her long fingernails had remained intact.|$|E
25|$|In August 2002, the Cherokee Nation {{conducted}} a survey of 115,026 Cherokee citizens who live within the 14 counties of the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma. Their aim was to evaluate {{the status of the}} language. Of those surveyed, 91% reported that they at least heard the language being used in the public domain; 18% heard the language used in hospitals, 14% reported hearing it at church, 12% used/heard the language at home, 9% <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> in stores, 8% <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> at work, 7% <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> at school, 7% <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> on grounds, 6% <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> in courts, and 8% <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> in other settings. In the home, Cherokee was only used by 17% of survey respondents; the overwhelming majority spoke only English in the home setting. 18% of the surveyed persons spoke Cherokee as a first language, and 5% had learned Cherokee and English jointly as primary languages. At the beginning of the 20th century, 75% of Cherokee citizens are believed to have been raised bilingually in Cherokee and English. Today, only about 5% or less are raised in Cherokee-speaking homes. Many speakers, perhaps the majority, are over fifty years of age. Another 2002 survey indicated that the Cherokee language was very close to extinction, as few people younger than the grandparental generation were found who were fluent in the language. Usually, older adults are the final speakers of a language. If they do not pass it along to their descendants, the language will be lost. Thus, the 2002 estimate for the lifespan of the language was only about 30–40 years. The Cherokee language in North Carolina was found to be particularly imperiled, with perhaps fewer than 1,000 remaining speakers and elderly speakers dying off far more quickly than new speakers were emerging. From such surveys the Cherokee Nation also learned that most of its members believed preservation of Cherokee culture and language for future generations is essential.|$|E

25|$|Isolation — Richard Wiseman {{and others}} argue {{that not all of}} the studies used {{soundproof}} rooms, so it is possible that when videos were playing, the experimenter could have <b>heard</b> <b>it,</b> and later given involuntary cues to the receiver during the selection process.

25|$|The impulse of the Moravian Church {{after its}} renewal at Herrnhut was to evangelise. This did not entail {{proselytising}} from other churches.
