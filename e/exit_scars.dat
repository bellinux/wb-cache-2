A systematic analysis of both the sinus rhythm and tachycardia ECGs provides much information that is critical for further decision making. The 12 -lead ECG is used to exclude the other differential diagnostic possibilities, outline the substrate for postinfarct VT, define the likely region of VT <b>exit</b> from the <b>scar</b> border, as well as allow for detailed intracardiac analysis using entrainment and pace mapping during catheter ablation procedures...|$|R

40|$|Following {{disease or}} {{injury to the}} CNS, the {{formation}} of a glial scar represents a physical and molecular barrier to repair. Although some therapies have promoted axonal sprouting into the lesion site, these fibres are often tangled and disorientated. To date, there has been little evidence of regenerating fibres successfully <b>exiting</b> the glial <b>scar</b> to reform functional connections. Furthermore, remyelination after disease or injury is limited, often consisting of shorter internodes of myelin and thinner sheaths. Thus, potential therapies aimed at enhancing CNS repair should support the outgrowth of neurites, guide their exit from the glial scar and perhaps aid remyelination. Since multiple factors impede the regeneration of the CNS, a combinatorial approach to therapies including cell-transplantation may be a more promising strategy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} {{the relation of the}} paced QRS configuration and conduction delay during pace mapping to reentry circuit sites in patients with ventricular tachycardia late after myocardial infarction. Background. The QRS configuration produced by ventricular pacing during sinus rhythm (pace mapping) can locate focal idiopathic ventricular tachycardias during catheter mapping, but postinfarction reentry circuits may be relatively large and contain regions of slow conduction. We hypothesized that for postinfarction ventricular tachycardia, 1) pacing during sinus rhythm at reentry circuit sites distant from the <b>exit</b> from the <b>scar</b> would produce a QRS configuration different from the tachycardia; and 2) a stimulus to QRS delay during pace mapping may be a useful guide to reentry circuit slow conduction zones. Methods. Catheter mapping and ablation were performed in 18 consecutive patients with ventricular tachycardia after myocardial infarction. At 85 endocardial sites in 13 patients, 12 -lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) were recorded during pace mapping, and participation of each site in a reentry circuit was then evaluated by entrainment techniques during induced ventricular tachycardia or by application of radiofrequency current. Results. Pace maps resembled tachycardia at 40 ms was observed at â‰¥ 70 % of reentry circuit sites. Conclusions. At many sites in postinfarction ventricular reentry circuits, the QRS configuration during pace mapping does not resemble the ventricular tachycardia QRS complex, consistent with relatively large reentry circuits or regions of functional conduction block during ventricular tachycardia. A stimulus to QRS delay during pace mapping is consistent with slow conduction and may aid in targeting endocardial sites for further evaluation during tachycardia...|$|R
