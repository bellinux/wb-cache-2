40|$|In this paper, {{the ability}} of the Hinode/EIS {{instrument}} to detect radiative signatures of coronal heating is investigated. Recent observational studies of AR cores suggest that both the low and <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>heating</b> mechanisms are consistent with observations. Distinguishing between these possibilities is important for identifying the physical mechanism(s) of the heating. The Differential Emission Measure (DEM) tool is one diagnostic that allows to make this distinction, through the amplitude of the DEM slope coolward of the coronal peak. It is therefore crucial to understand the uncertainties associated with these measurements. Using proper estimations of the uncertainties involved in the problem of DEM inversion, we derive confidence levels on the observed DEM slope. Results show that the uncertainty in the slope reconstruction strongly depends on the number of lines constraining the slope. Typical uncertainty is estimated to be about ± 1. 0, in the more favorable cases. Comment: 29 pages, 8 figure...|$|E

40|$|In {{ballistic}} transport, heat carriers such as phonons {{travel through}} the solid without any scattering or interaction. Therefore, there is no temperature gradient in the solid, which seems to transport the heat without getting heated itself. Ballistic transport is typically seen in high purity crystals at either temperatures below ~ 10 K, or physical size below ~ 100 nm, where the mean free path of the carrier {{is larger than the}} solid itself.

Unlike prior works which have treated phonon coupling as damping, we account for coherent phonon coupling using a full quantum-mechanical treatment. We observe strong asymmetry in absorption spectrum in CPT and negative dispersion in EIT susceptibility in the presence of coherent phonon coupling which cannot be accounted for if only pure phonon damping is considered.

40|$|In {{their natural}} state, most {{hardwoods}} cannot be bent to an appreciably small radius of curvature. This {{is due to}} either fracturing or retaining elastic properties sufficient to cause spring back to approximately their original shape on removal of the bending force. But some species when subjected to heat {{in the presence of}} moisture (usually by steaming or boiling) become semi-plastic and their compressibility is very increased. By holding the bended material to shape after bending, and subsequently drying and cooling it, the wood tends to become rigid and “set” almost exactly to the curved shape imposed on it by bending. The rate of production when using traditional methods for solid wood bending is considerably slow and there is request from the industry to reducing the processing time and thereby reducing the production costs. A new method for solid wood bending is presented in this paper. The method is based on high frequency technique for heating, plasticizing and drying the wood to be bent in one step. One of the purposes to use <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>heating</b> was to decrease the time of the bending process.

We present the first spatially resolved maps of the EM slope in the 1 – 3 MK range within the core of the AR using several methods, both approximate and from the Differential Emission Measure (DEM). A significant variation of the slope is found at different spatial locations within the active region.

40|$|Although {{substantial}} {{work has}} been carried out using electromagnetic (EM) radiation in the form of radio frequency (RF) induction or microwave heating to process metals, alloys and cold crucibles for melting many difficult refractory and/or reactive materials using induction, none have so far provided a theoretical basis for using the technologies with insulators such as ceramics, glass-ceramics and conductors. In contrast to Joule melting, RF and microwaves provide a highly efficient technique for preparation of high-density and refractory materials using conductors or insulators. When one attempts to melt ceramics or glasses using induction heating, it becomes apparent that induction will not work. Some elements and most ceramics, glasses as well as some alloys are either good insulators or have very poor electrical conductivity. The usual way to melt these materials with an electromagnetic field requires the use of a high melting point conductor, called a susceptor that will couple with the EM field and heats up by induced eddy currents, in turn heating the sample. A solution to this problem is to invoke the MOTT Transition phenomenon which shows that the conductivity of a material is dependent of temperature. Simply stated an insulator can become conductive by increasing its temperature and reciprocally a conductor can become an insulator with increase in temperature. It is also well known that the EM penetration depth is a function of frequency of the EM field and the resistivity of the material. Melting of materials was carried out with and without a conductor to start the melting by using both induction low frequency heating and dielectric <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>heating.</b> This thesis presents both a theoretical explanation as well as results that show the advantages of the technology, as applied to processing and melting a wide range of materials using EM radiation in the form of induction or microwaves in a resonant cavity.

This rise is likely to rapidly change the earth’s climate, for example, leading to rising sea levels and a <b>higher</b> <b>frequency</b> of <b>heat</b> waves and heavy precipitation. Business-as-usual or ‘baseline’ climate change implies increasingly severe economic impacts if action is not taken to mitigate the worse effects...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the effect of workpiece preheating with <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> induction <b>heating</b> on improvement of machinability of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V during end milling using PVD TiAlN coated inserts. Tool life, cutting force and vibration were investigated during the experiments. Design/methodology/approach: End milling tests were conducted on Vertical Machining Centre (VMC ZPS, Model: MCFV 1060 with quarter immersion cutting. Titanium based alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V bar was used as the work-piece. Machining was performed with a 20 mm diameter end-mill tool holder (R 390 - 020 B 20 - 11 M) fitted with one insert. PVD TiAlN coated carbide inserts (R 390 - 11 T 3 08 E-ML 2030) were used in the experiments. All of the experiments were run at room temperature and preheated conditions. The preheated temperature was maintained at 420 ºC and no phase change of the workpiece in preheating was ensured from the phase diagram of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. <b>High</b> <b>frequency</b> induction <b>heating</b> was utilized to run the preheated machining. Findings: Preheating helps in substantially increasing tool life and in lowering down the cutting force value, lowering the amplitude of vibration and dynamic forces. Practical implications: The cost of machining Ti- 6 Al- 4 V is extremely high because of the relatively low machining speed and short tool life. Therefore, improving the machinability of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V is a research topic of much interest, with a number of approaches reported with varied results, such as, cryogenic cutting, high-pressure coolant, rotary-tool, and minimum quantity lubrication (MQL). Originality/value: A new approach of induction preheating to overcome the difficulties in machining of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V is presented in this paper. In preheated machining, <b>high</b> <b>frequency</b> induction <b>heating</b> is used as an external heat source to soften the work material surface layer in order to decrease its tensile strength and strain hardening. An experimental study has been performed to assess the effect of workpiece preheating using induction heating system to enhance the machinability of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. The preheating temperature was maintained below the phase change temperature of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V...|$|R
