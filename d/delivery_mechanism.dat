5|$|Euchambersia was a {{small and}} short-snouted therocephalian, {{possessing}} large canines as {{is typical of the}} group. However, it is notable among therocephalians for possessing ridges on its canines and a large indentation {{in the side of the}} skull. Under the erroneous assumption that the canines are grooved instead of ridged, it has been proposed that these structures supported a venom <b>delivery</b> <b>mechanism.</b> More recently, the internal structure of the skull of Euchambersia has been used as stronger evidence in favour of the hypothesis that it was venomous; other possibilities, such as the indentation supporting some sort of sensory organ, still remain plausible.|$|E
5|$|CT {{scanning}} of {{the known}} specimens of Euchambersia by Benoit and colleagues was subsequently used to provide more concrete support in favour of the venom hypothesis. The canals leading into and from the maxillary fossae, as revealed by the scans, would primarily have supported the trigeminal nerve as well as blood vessels. However, {{the fact that the}} canals also directly lead to the root of the canines would suggest that they had a secondary role in venom delivery. In all, Euchambersia seems to have had a venom gland (housed in the maxillary fossae), a <b>delivery</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the venom (the maxillary canals), and an instrument by which a wound for venom delivery can be inflicted (the ridged canines), which satisfy the criteria of a venomous animal as defined by Wolfgang Bücherl. Benoit et al. noted that this does not conclusively demonstrate that Euchambersia was actually venomous, especially given the previously stated objections. Additionally, there are no living animals with a delivery system analogous to the proposed system for Euchambersia (most deliver venom through the lower jaw, while snakes have specialized ducts.|$|E

500|$|Many iTunes {{customers}} were unhappy that {{the album was}} added to their music libraries without their consent. For users with automatic music downloads enabled in iTunes, Songs of Innocence downloaded automatically to their electronic devices. Chris Richards of The Washington Post called the release [...] "rock-and-roll as dystopian junk mail". Slate {{said that it was}} [...] "extremely unsettling" [...] that [...] "consent and interest are no longer a requisite for owning an album, only corporate prerogative". Vijith Assar of Wired said: [...] "The <b>delivery</b> <b>mechanism</b> amounts to nothing more than spam with forced downloads." [...] In response to the criticism, Apple created a dedicated page on their website to allow users to delete the album from their iTunes accounts. Bono said he was unaware of the automatic download option. Former U2 manager Paul McGuinness thought the album had been [...] "positioned wrongly" [...] and would not have offended anyone had there been a method to opt into receiving it. Describing U2's and Apple's intentions, Bono said, [...] "We wanted to deliver a pint of milk to people's front porches, but in a few cases it ended up in their fridge, on their cereal. People were like, 'I'm dairy-free.'" [...] Although he apologized to a fan during a Facebook Q session for the album's addition to their music library, publicly he refused to offer an apology, saying, [...] "It's one of the proudest moments in U2's history." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of the Internet has made many institutions involved {{in the delivery of}} distance education programs re-evaluate the course delivery framework. A variety of models and techniques co-exist in an often uneasy alliance at many such institutions. These range from the traditional distance learning model, which remains paper-based, to the purely online model. Recently, hybrid models have emerged which apparently attempt to forge elements taken from several models into a unified whole. Many of these hybrid models seek to eliminate paper-based materials from the tuition process. While many arguments are put forward about the efficacy of purely electronic <b>delivery</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> cost containment is often the driving motivation. This study explores student perceptions of the various <b>delivery</b> <b>mechanisms</b> for distance learning materials.

The LUS is a requirement of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009, highlighting the important contribution that Scottish Ministers expect land use and land management to make towards the climate change agenda in Scotland.
