"Troth," [...] said O'Riley, gazing round {{towards the}} land, where the distant cliffs loomed black and heavy {{in the fading}} light, and out upon the floes and hummocks, where the <b>frost</b> <b>smoke</b> from pools of open water on the horizon circled round the pinnacles of the icebergs,--"troth, it's a cowld place intirely to go to wan's bed in, but that fat-faced Exqueemaw seems to be settin' about it quite coolly; so here goes!" ...|$|E

40|$|In {{a coastal}} region where strong {{offshore}} winds and currents prevail, newly-formed sea ice is removed {{as quickly as}} it forms. Consequently, the open water areas are maintained {{for a long period of}} time, despite considerable ice production. Such open waters, or coastal polynyas, release latent heat of fusion of ice and moisture from the ocean to the atmosphere. High-salinity brine is also excluded to the ocean by sea-ice formation. The polynyas may have great influence on the atmosphere-ocean interaction. Satellite images have suggested the presence of winter coastal polynyas between fast ice (or ice shelf) and pack ice regions off Lutzow-Holm Bay and Breid Bay, Antarctica. In 1990 - 1992,oceanographic observations were intensively conducted by the 31 st and 32 nd Japanese Antarctic Research Expeditions to understand sea-ice and oceanic processes in the polynya off Lutzow-Holm Bay. Under windy conditions, aircraft observations revealed many new-ice streaks formed approximately parallel to the wind direction and generation of <b>frost</b> <b>smoke</b> from the open water. Water temperature profiles in the polynya were obtained by using aircraft-deployed expendable bathythermographs (AXBT) with a depth capability of 460 m. Based on the temperature data, it is estimated that the thickness of the convective-mixed layer with its freezing point is 350 - 450 m. The mixed layer has a tendency to deepen in winter. According to the austral summer oceanographic data acquired on board the icebreakers FUJI and SHIRASE, winter convective-mixed layers remain cold and oxygen-rich in the polynya regions. These mixed layers were evidently thicker than those in pack ice regions. Such water structures were also formed in the Breid Bay polynya. The thick convective-mixed layer is considered to reflect the processes of vigorous sea-ice production and the resultant convective mixing in the open polynyas...|$|E

40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsKevin GwinnerUnder the {{leadership}} of the Van Eekeren family, Land O’ Frost {{has become one of the}} fastest growing meat processing manufacturers in the United States. “Premium” is Land O’ Frost’s flagship brand which makes up 57 % of the company’s total sales dollars. Of the line of Premium lunchmeats, Honey Smoked Turkey is ranked # 3 in total sales dollars. However, if you rank the product’s performance by dividing its all commodity volume (ACV) by the number of pounds sold, it is ranked # 7 out of the nine single pack flavors offered in retail. There has been internal speculation that the Honey Smoked Turkey’s sales performance is related to a lack of honey/sweetness flavor in the lunchmeat. As a result, Land O’ Frost needed to determine if the current level of honey/sweetness flavor of the Honey Smoked Turkey needs to be increased in order to stimulate higher growth in sales. A third party consultant conducted a consumer test between Land O’ <b>Frost’s</b> honey <b>smoked</b> turkey and their top two competitors’ honey smoked turkey. Based on the results, the Land O’ Frost product was the least likely preferred and was rated as having the lowest sweetness flavor profile among the three products. In an effort to develop a sweeter tasting honey turkey, different test formulations were developed using different honeys, levels of honey and sweeteners. The lighter the honey grade the less flavor impact was present in the turkey. As a result, a test formula containing twice the amount of light amber honey and the maximum amount of sugar was developed to be sweeter and to offer better marketing claims to potentially attract more customers. Due to product process differences between the Land O’ <b>Frost’s</b> honey <b>smoked</b> turkey and its competitor’s, the decision was made to conduct another consumer test between the current control and the newly formulated test product. The data determined that there was not a significant difference between the two products tested. A triangle test was conducted via a third party and it also confirmed the same conclusion. With the test formula having a slightly higher cost per pound than the current control formula, it was decided internally that the test formula could replace the current formula if the test formula price per pound can be adjusted to the same cost as the control. I would recommend that the level of sugar in the new test formula be slightly decreased until the formula cost per pound is the same as the control. The cost of meat raw materials used by Land O’ Frost often changes due to market price conditions. The new formulated honey smoked turkey’s selling potential would still have a positive impact by utilizing claims such as “double the honey” and “lower sodium” on the package. In this case, the selling potential increase would be more heavily executed from a marketing perspective than from flavor development...|$|R
