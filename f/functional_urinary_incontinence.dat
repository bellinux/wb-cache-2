40|$|In this {{dissertation}} thesis, {{health insurance}} funds data on psychotropic prescriptions {{for children and}} adolescents in Germany are presented and analysed. The data refer to prescription patterns in different child and adolescent psychiatric disorders (depressive disorders, autism spectrum disorders, tic disorders, eating disorders, <b>functional</b> <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence)</b> and also to prescription of defined pharmacological substance groups (antidepressants, antipsychotics). The psychotropic prescriptions were stratified by age groups, sex and sub-diagnosis of the respective child and adolescent psychiatric disorder. In some of the papers compiled in this thesis, the specialty of the prescribing physician was also evaluated. The use of the mentioned health insurance funds data allowed to study the data of up to 1. 6 m children and adolescents (population under risk). Study designs involved both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses over time periods of up to eight years, employing various statistical methods. The two papers analysing time trends in the prescription of antidepressants and antipsychotics show a marked increase in the prescription of these substance groups over recent years. Regarding antipsychotics, a considerable increase in the prescription of atypical antipsychotics and a substantial proportion of non-guideline adherent therapies was found. The study on antidepressant prescriptions showed a distinct increase in SSRI prescriptions, with TCA still accounting for {{a significant percentage of}} prescriptions. The papers on psychotropic prescriptions in various child and adolescent psychiatric disorders (autism spectrum disorders, depressive disorders, tic disorders, eating disorders, <b>functional</b> <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence)</b> constitute a foundational inventory of psychopharmacological therapy in German children and adolescents with mental health problems. They show that for some of these conditions, current guidelines are applied only in a fraction of patients. Concluding, the findings compiled in this thesis indicate a general trend towards increased psychotropic prescriptions in children and adolescents and point to the need of implementation of child and adolescent psychiatric guidelines into daily practice...|$|E

METHOD A cross-sectional study with 156 patients treated in a neurological clinic. Data were collected through interviews and forwarded to nurses for diagnostic inference. RESULTS 92. 3 % of the patients {{had at least one}} of the studied diagnoses; OUI showed the highest prevalence (72. 4 %), followed by FUI (53. 2 %), RUI (50. 0 %), UUI (41. 0 %) and SUI (37. 8 %). Overdistended bladder and reports of inability to reach the toilet in time to avoid urine loss were the most prevalent defining characteristics.

To compare oxybutynin, placebo, and {{bladder training}} in overactive bladder (OAB), and cognitive treatment and pelvic floor training in dysfunctional voiding (DV), a multi-center controlled trial was designed, the European Bladder Dysfunction Study. Seventy girls and 27 boys with clinically diagnosed OAB and urge incontinence were randomly allocated to placebo, oxybutynin, or bladder training (branch I), and 89 girls and 16 boys with clinically diagnosed DV to either cognitive treatment or pelvic floor training (branch II).

Urodynamic studies were performed before and after treatment. In branch I, the 15 % full response evolved to cure rates of 39 % for placebo, 43 % for oxybutynin, and 44 % for bladder training. In branch II, the 25 % full response evolved to cure rates of 52 % for controls and 49 % for pelvic floor training. Before treatment, detrusor overactivity (OAB) or pelvic floor overactivity (DV) did not correlate with the clinical diagnosis.

40|$|Between 1977 and 1979 an age {{stratified}} sample of people 65 years and over {{living in the}} community and in institutions in Gisborne, New Zealand was assessed medically and socially. This sample was followed and reviewed in 1982. At follow up 308 subjects were seen, 227 had died, and 24 had left the area. Factors predicting mortality were assessed. Using a log rank test, factors predicting mortality included age, impaired mental function, <b>functional</b> disability, <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> prescribed drugs, pulse pressure, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), systolic pressure, cardiovascular drugs, and falls. However, a number of these factors increased in prevalence with age.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the efficacy of}} transcutaneous functional electrical stimulation (FES) on voiding symptoms in children with myelomeningocele (MMC) suffering from neuropathic <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> Materials and Methods: Six girls and 6 boys with moderate to severe <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> secondary to MMC were included. Median age of children was 5. 04 (range: 3 - 11) years. They underwent a urodynamic study (UDS) before and 3 months after FES with special attention to detrusor leak point pressure (DLPP) and maximal bladder capacity (MBC). Daily incontinence score, frequency of pad changing, and enuresis were also assessed before and three months after treatment. Fifteen courses of FES for 15 minutes 3 times per week were performed with low frequency (40 Hz) electrical current, duration of 250 µs, with hold and rest time of 2 seconds. Results: Nine children had improvement on <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> score, while three children had no improvement. Median DLPP was significantly increased from 38. 5 (range: 12 - 50) cm H 2 O to 59. 5 (range: 18 - 83) cm H 2 O (P = 0. 003). MBC was significantly increased from median value of 155 (range: 60 - 250) mL to 200 (range: 110 - 300) mL (P = 0. 007).

At entry, parents under-reported UI on the questionnaires in 45 % of cases, compared with the urotherapist's scores, and the 12 -h pad test sensitivity for UI was only 64 % (95 % confidence interval 55 - 73 %). The voiding diaries had inconsistent entries on UI and on VV. VF was overestimated in the questionnaires and underestimated in the diaries, compared with the urotherapist's scores. A VF of > 7 /day decreased significantly after EBDS treatment, but with no correlation with treatment outcome.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{develop a}} {{prognostic}} model to predict mobility outcome one year post-stroke. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study {{in patients with}} a first-ever stroke admitted for inpatient rehabilitation. PATIENTS: A total of 217 patients with stroke (mean age 58 years) following inpatient rehabilitation in 4 rehabilitation centres across the Netherlands. METHODS: Mobility was measured using the Rivermead Mobility Index at one year poststroke. Included independent variables were: patient and stroke characteristics, <b>functional</b> status, <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> sitting balance, motor and cognitive function. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were performed in a model-developing set (n= 174) and the model was validated in cross-validation set (n= 43). RESULTS: Total Rivermead Mobility Index score at one year post-stroke was predicted by functional status, sitting balance, time between stroke onset and measurement, and age. The derived model predicted 48 % of the variance, while validation in the cross-validation set resulted in an adjusted R(2) of 0. 47. CONCLUSION: The present prospective study shows that outcome of mobility one year after stroke can be predicted validly by including functional status, sitting balance, moment of admission to the rehabilitation centre after stroke onset and age...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the subjective, lived {{experience}} of women who suffer from long-term <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> and to show how a cultural model helps define that experience. Using an illness narrative approach and underlying theoretical frameworks from cognitive and critical medical anthropology, the specific aims of the study were to describe and analyze (1) what <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> means, and (2) how that meaning is constructed by women who live with long-term <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> Seventeen community-dwelling women (ages 28 – 86) participated in in-depth interviews. Three dominant plot types were discovered in informant 2 ̆ 7 s narratives: the <b>Urinary</b> <b>Incontinence</b> Quest Narrative, <b>Urinary</b> <b>Incontinence</b> Restitution and Redemption Narratives, and the <b>Urinary</b> <b>Incontinence</b> Victim Narrative. Three dominant themes evolved from interview data: Strategies for Living with <b>Urinary</b> <b>Incontinence,</b> Memories of <b>Urinary</b> <b>Incontinence,</b> and Responses to <b>Urinary</b> <b>Incontinence.</b> Four dominant themes were identified in media representations of female incontinence: Normalizing <b>Urinary</b> <b>Incontinence,</b> Fixing <b>Urinary</b> <b>Incontinence,</b> Stigmatizing <b>Urinary</b> <b>Incontinence,</b> and Avoiding <b>Urinary</b> <b>Incontinence.</b> Plot types, shared themes from narrative interviews, and influences from others were compared with themes that emerged from public representations of female incontinence, and a cultural model for long-term female <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> was developed. Findings suggest: (1) the meaning of long-term female <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> is constructed and negotiated as a result of individual and shared experiences, interactions with healthcare professionals, friends, and family members, and publicly available representations of female <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> (2) the cultural model constructed by women differs significantly from the public model for female <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> and (3) women 2 ̆ 7 s narratives provide a method for accommodating similarities and differences between personal and public models for female <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> Implications for clinical practice, education, and research are also included. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTR ACT: <b>Urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> {{in women}} is quite {{prevalent}} today and management can be costly. <b>Urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> can be minimal or quite bothersome, limiting {{activities of daily}} living. It is subdivided into urgency <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> stress <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> and mixed <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> As such, treatment can vary immensely depending on the clinical presentations, ranging from behavioral modification to medicinal thera-pies to surgical procedures. First-line management for all <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> includes lifestyle and behavioral modifications. Historically, treatment options for urgency <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> were predominantly antimuscarinics, while more recent therapies include oral beta- 3 agonist administration, sacral neuromodulation, onabotulinumtoxinA injection, and posterior tibial nerve stimulation. Stress <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> can be treated {{with a variety of}} urethral bulking agent injections or sling-based procedures using mesh, autologous fascia, or cadaveric fascia, as well as urethral intrasphincteric injec-tions of autologous muscle-derived cells in new clinical trials.

40|$|Purpose: To {{develop a}} {{decision}} support system to discriminate the diagnoses of alterations in urinary elimination, according to the nursing terminology of NANDA International (NANDA-I). Methods: A fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) was structured considering six possible diagnoses: stress urinary incontinence, reflex urinary incontinence, urge urinary incontinence, <b>functional</b> <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> total urinary incontinence and urinary retention; and 39 signals associated with them. the model was implemented in Microsoft Visual C++(R) Edition 2005 and applied in 195 real cases. Its performance was evaluated through the agreement test, comparing its results with the diagnoses determined by three experts (nurses). the sensitivity and specificity of the model were calculated considering the expert's opinion as a gold standard. in order to compute the Kappa's values we considered two situations, since more than one diagnosis was possible: the overestimation of the accordance in which the case was considered as concordant when at least one diagnoses was equal; and the underestimation of the accordance, in which the case was considered as discordant when at least one diagnosis was different. Results: the overestimation of the accordance showed an excellent agreement (kappa = 0. 92, p < 0. 0001); and the underestimation provided a moderate agreement (kappa = 0. 42, p < 0. 0001). in general the FCM model showed high sensitivity and specificity, of 0. 95 and 0. 92, respectively, but provided a low specificity value in determining the diagnosis of urge urinary incontinence (0. 43) and a low sensitivity value to total urinary incontinence (0. 42). Conclusions: the {{decision support system}} developed presented a good performance compared to other types of expert systems for differential diagnosis of alterations in urinary elimination. Since there are few similar studies in the literature, we are convinced {{of the importance of}} investing in this kind of modeling, both from the theoretical and from the health applied points of view. Limitations: in spite of the good results, the FCM should be improved to identify the diagnoses of urge urinary incontinence and total urinary incontinence. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> is {{a common}} problem among women and it is {{estimated}} that between 15 and 55 % of them complain of lower urinary symptoms. The most prevalent form of <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> is associated with stress, followed by mixed <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> and urge <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> It is a symptom with several effects on quality of life of women mainly in their social, familiar and sexual domains. Female reproductive and urinary systems share anatomical structures, which promotes that urinary problems interfere with sexual function in females. This article is a review of both the concepts of female <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> and its impact on global and sexual quality of life. Nowadays, it is assumed that <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> especially urge <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> promotes anxiety and several self-esteem damages in women. The odour and the fear of incontinence during sexual intercourse affect female sexual function and this is related with the unpredictability and the chronicity of <b>incontinence,</b> namely urge <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> Female <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> management involves conservative (pelvic floor muscle training), surgical and pharmacological treatment. Both conservative and surgical treatments have been studied about its benefit in <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> and also the impact among female sexual function.

RESULTS The two-year <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> prevalences following vaginal childbirth and cesarean section were 17 % and 18. 9 %, respectively. The only risk factor for pelvic floor muscle dysfunction was weight gain during pregnancy. Body mass index less than 25 kg/m 2 and normal pelvic floor muscle function protected against <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> Gestational <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> increased the risk of two-year postpartum <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> CONCLUSION Gestational <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> was a crucial precursor of postpartum <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> Weight gain during pregnancy increased the subsequent risk of pelvic floor muscle dysfunction, and elective cesarean section did not prevent <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence...</b>|$|R

Case series and clinical trials reporting the effect of surgical, behavioral, and/or pharmacological weight loss on <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> are summarized. Results: Epidemiological studies demonstrate that obesity is a strong and independent risk factor for prevalent and incident <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> There is a clear dose-response effect of weight on <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> with each 5 -unit increase in body mass index associated with a 20 %&ndash; 70 % increase in risk of <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> The maximum effect of weight on <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> has an odds ratio of 4 &ndash; 5. The odds of incident <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> over 5 &ndash; 10 years increase by approximately 30 %&ndash; 60 % for each 5 -unit increase in body mass index. There appears to be a stronger association between increasing weight and prevalent and incident stress incontinence (including mixed incontinence) than for urge incontinence. Weight loss studies indicate that both surgical and nonsurgical weight loss leads to significant improvements in prevalence, frequency, and/or symptoms of <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> Conclusion: Epidemiological studies document overweight and obesity as important risk factors for <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> Weight loss by both surgical and more conservative approaches is effective in reducing <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> symptoms and should be strongly considered as a first line treatment for overweight and obese women with <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> Keywords: <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> obesity, wome...|$|R

30|$|It was {{determined}} that one-third of the women had <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> and certain medical and obstetric conditions were affecting the development of <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> It is thought {{that it is important}} for the healthcare personnel to take the progression of the <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> under control by preventing the risk factors and to encourage the patients to seek treatment with the help of the proper information indicating that <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> is a treatable and preventable condition.|$|R

40|$|<b>Urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> is a multi-factorial {{condition}} {{that has a}} high impact on older persons living in nursing homes. While <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> is common, {{only a small percentage}} of nursing home residents have an official diagnosis. Factors influencing <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> in this population are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> in Norwegian nursing home residents and to study the factors associated with <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> in this population. Residents from six different nursing homes were included in this study. Data on sex, age, medication, comorbid illnesses, <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> and the use of absorbent pads was collected. Barthel`s Index of Activities of Daily Living (ADL) was used to estimate residents’ functional levels. Post-voiding residual urine was measured by means of a portable ultrasound. A questionnaire was completed by the nursing staff for each of the residents. In total, 173 residents participated in the study. One hundred and twenty-two residents (69 %) were incontinent for urine and 144 used absorbent pads (83 %). Fourteen percent of residents used absorbent pads ‘just to make sure’. They did not have a history of <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> Low ADL score, dementia and urinary tract infection were significantly associated with incontinence for urine. The prevalence of <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> in Norwegian nursing homes is high.

40|$|<b>Urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> is a growing {{problem that}} affects {{millions}} of people worldwide.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> in noninstitu-tionalized persons older than 60 {{years of age}} is 15 % to 35 %; of these, 25 % to 30 % have frequent episodes of <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> (1). The significance of urinary in-continence may vary from minimal to severe, with ex-treme activity limitation and social isolation. For exam-ple, several reports have linked <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> in community-dwelling elders with falls and depression (2, 3). <b>Urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> also imposes significant psy-chosocial distress on family, friends, and caregivers (1). <b>Urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> is even more prevalent {{in the nursing home}} than in the community.

40|$|Almost every forth {{woman is}} {{suffering}} from <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> Most frequent types of <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> are stress <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> (SUI), over active bladder (OAB) and mixed <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> (MUI). Beside medical history and sonography, urodynamic testing is commonly used to differentiate between these forms of <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> During urodynamic testing the bladder capacity is measured routinely. A small bladder capacity has already been described in patients with over active bladder. Neither in stress <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> nor in mixed <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> the meaning of bladder capacity has been analyzed. In this trial the evaluation of a possible relationship between bladder capacity {{and the type of}} <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> was the point of interest. Therefore three groups of women with <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> were formed, in detail stress <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence,</b> over active bladder and mixed <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> Additionally a continent control group was examined in order to verify the results. As already known from current literature smallest bladder capacity was found in patients with over active bladder. Patients suffering from stress <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> showed a significantly higher bladder capacity than patients with over active bladder. This mismatch in bladder capacity could be explained with small bladders in the OAB group but could also be a hint for large bladder capacities in patients with SUI. Though these patients presented the largest bladder capacity, a significant difference to the control group was not obvious. Probably a certain bias was created by the control group being continent but showing possible risk factors for SUI in their patient history. Another significant difference was apparent between stress and mixed <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence.</b> A possible explanation would be that the component of overactivity had a stronger influence than stress component. As urodynamic testing is an expensive and invasive technique, there is desire to establish less invasive diagnostics like perineal sonography. Different sonographic markers for hypermobility of the urethra were measured in this trial and a comparison between the four groups was carried out including correlation analysis of bladder capacity and the sonographic findings. Finally no correlation was obvious. In consequence urodynamic testing so far remains the gold standard for diagnostic in <b>urinary</b> <b>incontinence</b> as it reveals not only morphologic aberrations but also functional changes...|$|R
