5|$|Italian ornithologist Tommaso Salvadori {{defined the}} new genus Neophema in 1891, placing the {{turquoise}} parrot within it {{and giving it}} its current scientific name. There is little <b>geographical</b> <b>variation,</b> with some minor local differences {{in the amount of}} orange on the belly. In 1915, Gregory Mathews described a subspecies dombrainii from Victoria on the basis of more prominent red on the scapulars; however, this distinction was not confirmed on review with New South Wales specimens, and hence no subspecies are recognised. One of six species of grass parrot in the genus Neophema, it is most closely related to the scarlet-chested parrot. The two are an allopatric species pair, and are the only two species in the genus to exhibit marked sexual dimorphism—where the male and female are different in appearance.|$|E
5|$|Subsistence crops {{grown in}} the country include matoke (green bananas), which occupy {{more than a third}} of the country's farmland, potatoes, beans, sweet potatoes, cassava, wheat and maize. Coffee and tea are the major cash crops for export, with the high altitudes, steep slopes and {{volcanic}} soils providing favourable conditions. Reports, have established that more than 400,000 Rwandans, make their living from coffee plantation. Reliance on agricultural exports makes Rwanda vulnerable to shifts in their prices. Animals raised in Rwanda include cows, goats, sheep, pigs, chicken, and rabbits, with <b>geographical</b> <b>variation</b> in the numbers of each. Production systems are mostly traditional, although there are a few intensive dairy farms around Kigali. Shortages of land and water, insufficient and poor-quality feed, and regular disease epidemics with insufficient veterinary services are major constraints that restrict output. Fishing takes place on the country's lakes, but stocks are very depleted, and live fish are being imported in an attempt to revive the industry.|$|E
5|$|The {{regional}} specialties {{that are}} a feature of early modern and contemporary cuisine were not in evidence in the sparser documentation that survives. Instead, medieval cuisine can be differentiated by the cereals and the oils that shaped dietary norms and crossed ethnic and, later, national boundaries. <b>Geographical</b> <b>variation</b> in eating was primarily the result of differences in climate, political administration, and local customs that varied across the continent. Though sweeping generalizations should be avoided, more or less distinct areas where certain foodstuffs dominated can be discerned. In the British Isles, northern France, the Low Countries, the northern German-speaking areas, Scandinavia and the Baltic, the climate was generally too harsh for the cultivation of grapes and olives. In the south, wine was the common drink for both rich and poor alike (though the commoner usually {{had to settle for}} cheap second pressing wine) while beer was the commoner's drink in the north and wine an expensive import. Citrus fruits (though not the kinds most common today) and pomegranates were common around the Mediterranean. Dried figs and dates were available in the north, but were used rather sparingly in cooking.|$|E

5|$|With prey often {{scarce in}} its oceanic environment, the silky shark is a swift, inquisitive, and {{persistent}} hunter. It feeds mainly on bony fishes and cephalopods, {{and has been}} known to drive them into compacted schools before launching open-mouthed, slashing attacks. This species often trails schools of tuna, a favored prey. Its sense of hearing is extremely acute, allowing it to localize the low-frequency noises generated by other feeding animals, and, by extension, sources of food. The silky shark is viviparous, meaning that the developing embryos are sustained by a placental connection to their mother. Significant <b>geographical</b> <b>variation</b> is seen in its life history details. Reproduction occurs year-round except in the Gulf of Mexico, where it follows a seasonal cycle. Females give birth to litters of up to 16pups annually or biennially. The newborn sharks spend their first months in relatively sheltered reef nurseries on the outer continental shelf, growing substantially before moving into the open ocean.|$|E
25|$|Infantile {{botulism}} shows <b>geographical</b> <b>variation.</b> In the UK, {{only six}} {{cases have been}} reported between 1976 and 2006, yet the U.S. has much higher rates: 1.9 per 100,000 live births, 47.2% {{of which are in}} California. While the risk honey poses to infant health is small, taking the risk is not recommended until after one year of age, and then giving honey is considered safe.|$|E

40|$|Water balance {{considerations}} at {{the soil}} surface lead to an equation that relates the autocorrelation of soil moisture in climate models to (1) seasonality in the statistics of the atmospheric forcing, (2) the variation of evaporation with soil moisture, (3) the variation of runoff with soil moisture, and (4) persistence in the atmospheric forcing, as perhaps induced by land atmosphere feedback. <b>Geographical</b> <b>variations</b> in the relative strengths of these factors, which can be established through analysis of model diagnostics and which can be validated {{to a certain extent}} against observations, lead to <b>geographical</b> <b>variations</b> in simulated soil moisture memory and thus, in effect, to <b>geographical</b> <b>variations</b> in seasonal precipitation predictability associated with soil moisture.

25|$|The {{species is}} not {{particularly}} aggressive, feeding on small planktonic and pelagic crustaceans such as krill, prawns, shrimp, and mysids, as well as small squids and fishes. <b>Geographical</b> <b>variation</b> in diet is common, with fish in Malaysia taking species of polychaete worms as the preferred species. Studies on gill filtering mechanisms has shown the Malabar trevally's anatomy lies between two extremes, one which is a high filtration area characteristic of planktivorous species and the other of very low area which is associated with species which take large prey items. This further suggests the Malabar trevally can filter the small krill type prey, as well as taking larger fishes and squid. Seasonal diet fluctuation in the species has been observed in northern Australia, where a seasonal abundance of squid causes the preferred prey to change from paenid shrimp to these squid.|$|E
25|$|The bluefin {{trevally}} {{is a large}} fish, {{growing to}} a maximum known length of 117cm and a weight of 43.5kg, however it is rare at lengths greater than 80cm. It is similar in shape {{to a number of}} other large jacks and trevallies, having an oblong, compressed body with the dorsal profile slightly more convex than the ventral profile, particularly anteriorly. This slight convexity leads to the species having a much more pointed snout than most other members of Caranx. The dorsal fin is in two parts, the first consisting of 8 spines and the second of 1 spine followed by 21 to 24 soft rays. The anal fin consists of 2 anteriorly detached spines followed by 1 spine and 17 to 20 soft rays. The pelvic fins contain 1 spine and 20 soft rays. The caudal fin is strongly forked, and the pectoral fins are falcate, being longer than the length of the head. The lateral line has a pronounced and moderately long anterior arch, with the curved section intersecting the straight section below the lobe of the second dorsal fin. The curved section of the lateral line contains 55-70 scales while the straight section contains 0 to 10 scales followed by 27 to 42 strong scutes. The chest is completely covered in scales. The upper jaw contains a series of strong outer canines with an inner band of smaller teeth, while the lower jaw contains a single row of widely spaced conical teeth. The species has 25 to 29 gill rakers in total and there are 24 vertebrae present. The eye is covered by a moderately weakly developed adipose eyelid, and the posterior extremity of the jaw is vertically under or just past the anterior margin of the eye. Despite their wide range, the only <b>geographical</b> <b>variation</b> in the species is the depth of the body in smaller specimens.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the years}} after Gill's paper was published, over 30 'new' species of sillaginids were {{reported}} and scientifically described, {{many of which were}} synonyms of previously described species, with similarity between species, as well as minor <b>geographical</b> <b>variation</b> confounding taxonomists. [...] In 1985, Roland McKay of the Queensland Museum published a comprehensive review of the family to resolve these relationships, although a number of species are still listed as doubtful, with McKay unable to locate the holotypes. Along with the review of previously described species, McKay described an additional seven species, a number of which he described as subspecies. [...] After this 1985 paper, additional specimens came to light, proving that all the subspecies he had identified were individual species. In 1992, McKay published a synopsis of the Sillaginidae for the FAO, in which he elevated these subspecies to full species status.|$|E
2500|$|In life, the stout whiting is {{a creamy}} yellow to sandy pink colour dorsally, with a silvery white with mauve {{reflections}} ventrally.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to show the degree and extent of <b>geographical</b> <b>variations</b> in shell {{morphology}} {{in a series of}} Japanese land snails here tentatively referred to as Ainohelix editha (A. Adams) (Japanese name: 'Hime-maimai', cf. Habe, 1977). These snails are common in various parts of Hokkaido, the north-ernmost large island of Japan, dwelling in relatively mesic woodland habitats. The fact that A. editha includes diverse forms of land snails has been well known among Japanese malacologists (Iijima, 1892; Habe, 1977; Ito and Habe, 1983; Maeda et al., 1983). Nevertheless, no intensive studies have so far been made on these land snails. In the present paper, we review factual evidence of their <b>geographical</b> <b>variations</b> gathered by ourselves since 1985. We show below only an outline of the <b>geographical</b> <b>variations,</b> leaving detailed analyses of various aspects elsewhere.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} extent to which current <b>geographical</b> <b>variations</b> in {{mortality}} are influenced by patterns of migration since birth. It is based on a longitudinal study of migrants which consists of a representative sample of 10264 British residents born after 1890 and enumerated as part of the British Household Panel Study in 1991. Between 1991 and 1996, 527 of the study members died and these deaths were analysed by area of residence at birth and in 1991 at both the regional and local district geographical scales. These were compared with findings from the Oce for National Statistics Longitudinal Study. The British Household Panel Survey sample replicates the results of work conducted on the Longitudinal Study which finds that <b>geographical</b> <b>variations</b> in age–sex standardised mortality ratios at the regional scale cannot be attributed to selective migration. However, for the British Household Panel Survey sample, the major <b>geographical</b> <b>variations</b> at district level could be attributed to selective migration. <b>Geographical</b> <b>variations</b> in mortality are not well understood. Restrictions on what it is possible to analyse in the Oce for National Statistics Longitudinal Study may have resulted in the underestimation of the importance of local lifetime selective migration in producing the contemporary map of mortality variation across Britain. The British Household Panel Survey is a small, recent, but very flexible study, which can be used to investigate the eects of lifetime migration on mortality patterns for all of Britain. This first report of its results on mortality shows that it produces findings which accord with the much larger Longitudinal Study, but which can be taken further to show that selective migration over the whole life-course at the local level does appear to have significantly altere...|$|R
