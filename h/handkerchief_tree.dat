5000|$|Davidia involucrata, the dove-tree, <b>handkerchief</b> <b>tree,</b> pocket <b>handkerchief</b> <b>tree,</b> or ghost tree, is a {{medium-sized}} deciduous {{tree in the}} family Nyssaceae.

It is native to South Central and Southwest China from Hubei to southern Gansu, south to Guizhou, Sichuan and Yunnan, but is widely cultivated elsewhere.|$|E
50|$|Bryngarw House {{is thought}} to have been built in the 15th century and used as a farmhouse; {{although}} there is no documentation there is some architectural evidence to support this theory. The first recorded date of the existence of the house is in 1743. In 1775 John Popkin gave the house and its grounds to his sister Frances as a wedding present when she married into the Traherne family; the building appears to have been extensively modified during their residence. The last member of the Traherne family to occupy the house was Captain Onslow Powell Traherne, a well travelled Victorian industrialist, who apparently renovated and extended the house and laid out the existing formal gardens between 1910 and 1920, introducing many exotic species (including many species of rhododendron, magnolia, tulip <b>tree,</b> <b>handkerchief</b> <b>trees,</b> sugar maple, paperbark dogwood, sequoia and ginkgo biloba). Towards the end of his residence Captain Traherne experienced money troubles and sold the estate to a local business man R.S.Hayes in the late 1940s. He and his family then occupied the house until his death in 1959 when it was again sold.|$|R

50|$|A music video, {{directed}} by Kristin Barlowe, was released {{for the song}} to CMT on June 5, 2009. The video begins with Kate & Kacey lying asleep on a blanket. They are shown performing the song in a grassy meadow and driving in a Cadillac, following {{a man who is}} leaving <b>handkerchiefs</b> tied to <b>trees</b> {{along the side of the}} road. After picking up another guy at a gas station on the side of the road, the two end up at an elaborate tree house. Kacey and the man from the gas station stop halfway up the tree as Kate continues to follow the notes left by the other man. The final note she finds reads 'Wake up,' and the video ends with the two girls lying on the blanket asleep.|$|R

5000|$|Plant [...] "introduction" [...] {{means the}} first time that living matter - seed, {{cuttings}} or a whole plant - was brought back to Europe. Thus, the <b>Handkerchief</b> <b>tree</b> (Davidia involucrata) was discovered by Père David in 1869 but introduced to Britain by Ernest Wilson in 1901.|$|E
50|$|The Spier's Arboretum has {{a secure}} future with the {{prospect}} of additional species reaching maturity, such as aspen, toffee apple (katsura) tree, <b>handkerchief</b> <b>tree,</b> Wellingtonia, Wollemi pine, holm oak, walnut, fastigiate beech, sessile oak, monkey puzzle, and juniper that will give a total of around fifty tree species in the arboretum.|$|E
50|$|The {{hall and}} north wing were {{restored}} and converted into apartments and mews houses. The stone cantilevered staircase with the Hesketh family crest, the Georgian belvedere tower and the oval glass dome {{on the roof}} have been retained. The hall retains its Ionic colonnades and portico. The stable block has been converted to mews cottages. The formal gardens, ornamental ponds, lawns and tennis courts have been restored. The majority of trees around the hall are protected by a Tree Preservation Order and include many species, the rarest being a <b>handkerchief</b> <b>tree.</b>|$|E
50|$|Maniltoa grandiflora is {{a species}} of plant in the legume family (Fabaceae). Common names {{includes}} <b>handkerchief</b> <b>tree</b> and pokok sapu tangan. This plant has a synonym Maniltoa brawneodes. It can grow from 5 m to 15 m. Tumbuhan ini berupa pohon dengan tinggi 5 hingga 15 meter. The stem is straight, round, brown and sympodial. Its leaf is green, pinnate, elongate with smooth margin, and pointed at both ends, with dimension of 7-14 cm long, 3-8 cm wide with 1-1,5 cm long petiole. Its root develops from the radicle and is brownish white. The leaves, fruits, and bark of this plant contains saponin, flavonoid, dan polyphenol.|$|E
50|$|The gazebo to {{the right}} of the castle was built by the Admiral to view the {{incoming}} ships as they entered Swansea Bay. The gazebo surrounded by a stand of Monterey Pine 'Pinus radiata'. These trees have retained their lower branches which filter the prevailing winds and give greater cover (protection) to the area. A Japanese garden at the top of the gardens holds a red and white painted bridge, many bamboo and an artificial lake with waterfall passing underneath the bridge. The water which rises in Clyne Common, travels under the Japanese Bridge and through the Gardens to join the sea at Blackpill. Alongside the Bridge is a fine specimen of the <b>Handkerchief</b> <b>Tree</b> 'Davidia Involucrata var. vilmoriniana'.|$|E
50|$|The {{next phase}} of plant hunting was under Pochin’s {{grandson}} Henry McLaren, 2nd Lord Aberconway who sponsored expeditions from the Edwardian period which brought in large numbers of rhododendrons, camellias and magnolias to Britain. Notable plant hunters connected to Bodnant Garden included Ernest Wilson, who travelled extensively in China. He was first engaged by famous Veitch Nursery with the specific task of bringing back seeds of the <b>Handkerchief</b> <b>Tree</b> (Davidia involucrata), one of which still grows in Bodnant Garden’s Shrub Borders. He also brought back many magnolias for which the garden is famous, and other trees including the Acer griseum, Meliosma beaniana and Sorbus meliosmifolia. Wilson also discovered and brought back the Lilium regale which now grow on the rose terraces.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are fine}} mature {{woodlands}} {{and a large}} variety of rhododendrons and azaleas. In the early 20th century, Henry Morris Upcher obtained rhododendron seeds of various types from plantsman Ernest [...] "Chinese" [...] Wilson. Plants from this source which can found at the garden include Rhododendron ambiguum, calophytum and decorum, among others. Many other species of tree and shrub are represented in the garden,including fifteen kinds of magnolia, large specimen pieris. Among the other trees are maples, acers, styrax, eucryphia, pocket <b>handkerchief</b> <b>tree</b> davidia involucrata and {{a fine example of}} the snowdrop tree. Several overlook towers provide good views over the gardens, and of the nearby coast and surrounding countryside. A garden temple was constructed in the Park in 1975. Graham Brennan is the Head Warden.|$|E
50|$|When the Regional Association of Westphalia-Lippe (Landschaftsverband Westfalen-Lippe) {{stepped in}} to save the castle from total {{collapse}} in 1974, the park had also been neglected for over 50 years and looked accordingly. The restoration of the park lasted until 1982, at which time the park was opened to the public. About half of its roughly 30 hectares (75 acres) are woods, five hectares are lawns and the rest are water and paths. According to castle park information, 3,067 trees from over 300 species {{can be found in}} the park, among them rare species such as a 125-year-old Chinese <b>handkerchief</b> <b>tree,</b> a Japanese bigleaf magnolia and an American lily-of-the-valley tree. These exotic plants were brought to Herten by the castle's former owners upon returning from diplomatic missions in distant countries. Due to its botanic diversity the park was awarded the status of a cultural monument in 1988.|$|E
40|$|Morphogenesis {{in plants}} is usually reconstructed by {{scanning}} electron microscopy and histology of meristematic structures. These techniques are destructive and require many samples to obtain a consecutive series of states. Unfortunately, using this methodology the absolute timing of growth and complete relative initiation of organs remain obscure. To overcome this limitation, an in vivo observational method based on Epi-Illumination Light Microscopy (ELM) was developed and tested with a male inflorescence meristem (floral unit) of the <b>handkerchief</b> <b>tree</b> Davidia involucrata Baill. (Nyssaceae). We asked whether the most basal flowers of this floral unit arise in a basipetal sequence or, alternatively, are delayed in their development. The growing meristem was observed for 30 days, the longest live observation of a meristem achieved to date. The sequence of primordium initiation indicates a later initiation of the most basal flowers and not earlier or simultaneously as SEM images could suggest. D. involucrata exemplarily shows that live-ELM gives new insights into developmental processes of plants. In addition to morphogenetic questions such as the transition from vegetative to reproductive meristems or the absolute timing of ontogenetic processes, this method may also help to quantify cellular growth processes {{in the context of}} molecular physiology and developmental genetics studies...|$|E
