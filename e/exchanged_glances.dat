2500|$|Writing in his {{commentary}} {{on the influence of}} the Young British Artists, High Art Lite, the art historian Julian Stallabrass said, [...] "The Cult of the Street is telling of many characteristics of High Art Lite and its engagement with mass culture and the media. It takes as its subject not just the conventions of the street but youth and their modes of display in shops, clubs, parties, restaurants and even private homes ... they don't do much, Bond's people; they shop, of course, persistently, and present themselves to each other and the camera, dance sometimes, but the book is composed above all of an intricate fabric of <b>exchanged</b> <b>glances</b> and gazes." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 5 December 1940, Bonsergent {{was convicted}} by a German {{military}} court of insulting the Wehrmacht as {{he insisted on}} taking full responsibility, saying {{he wanted to show}} the French what sort of people the Germans were and he was shot on 23 December 1940. The execution of Bonsergent, a man guilty only of being a witness to an incident that was in itself only very trivial brought home to many of the French the precise nature of the [...] "New Order in Europe". All over Paris, posters warning that all who challenged the might of the Reich would be shot like Bonsergent were torn down or vandalized, despite the warnings from General von Stülpnagal that damaging the posters was an act of sabotage that would be punished via the death penalty; so many posters were torn down and/or vandalized that Stülpnagal had to post policemen to guard them. The writer Jean Bruller remembered being [...] "transfixed" [...] by reading about Bonsergent's fate and how [...] "people stopped, read, wordlessly <b>exchanged</b> <b>glances.</b> Some of them bared their heads as if {{in the presence of the}} dead". On Christmas Day 1940, Parisians woke to find that in the previous night, the posters announcing [...] Bonsergent's execution had been turned into shrines, being in Bruller's words [...] "surrounded by flowers, like on so many tombs. Little flowers of every kind, mounted on pins, had been struck on the posters during the night-real flowers and artificial ones, paper pansies, celluloid roses, small French and British flags". The writer Simone de Beauvoir stated that it was not just Bonsergent that people mourned, but also the end of the illusion as [...] "as for the first time these correct people who occupied our country were officially telling us they had executed a Frenchman guilty of not bowing his head to them".|$|E
