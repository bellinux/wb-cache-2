5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the episode, {{a unique}} type of {{flashback}} is shown: one on the island. In the aftermath of Oceanic Flight 815 crash's, Locke wakes up on the beach, and notices that <b>his</b> <b>toes</b> wiggle, making him realize that he is no longer paralyzed. He stands up and is called over by Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) to help with an injured person.|$|E
5|$|Two {{attempts}} were made to travel back to Shipwreck Camp to pick up extra food, but both failed, the second resulting in further losses of dogs and equipment. Chafe, whose feet had become gangrenous after severe frostbite, had <b>his</b> <b>toes</b> removed by second engineer Williamson, with improvised tools. McKinlay and Munro risked their lives by travelling over the sea ice towards Herald Island, in a final effort to locate either of the missing parties. They could get no nearer than , and from an examination of the distant island through binoculars could see no indications of life.|$|E
5|$|As the {{consultant}} {{talks with the}} residents of the town and investigates its history, the backstory of his injury is gradually revealed. After repeatedly stubbing <b>his</b> <b>toe</b> and covering it up with Apex bandages, {{the consultant}} accidentally stepped into pig feces during a company team retreat. Because of the colored bandage, he never discovered how <b>his</b> <b>toe</b> was badly infected, and fainted on the sidewalk after fleeing from an awards party. This led to the amputation of <b>his</b> <b>toe,</b> <b>his</b> departure from the nomenclature firm, and the beginning of his hermetic lifestyle.|$|R

5|$|Bhikshatana is {{depicted}} with jatabhadra (dishevelled matted locks) or with jatamandala (matted hair {{arranged in a}} circle). A serpent may be depicted in his matted hair, which is also adorned by the crescent moon. His forehead bears a tripundara, the Shaiva tilaka composed of three horizontal lines of sacred ash with a red dot in the middle representing the third eye. He wears a patta (ornamental head band)—sometimes adorned with a human skull motif—on his forehead. Snake ornaments adorn his body, and bronze images often depict multiple necklaces, a waist-band, armlets, elbow bands, bracelets, anklets, and rings on all <b>his</b> <b>toes</b> and fingers. A snake is also tied around his waist and a white yagnopavita (sacred thread) is worn across the chest.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} 4 {{days since the}} crash, September 25, 2004. Locke awakens from Oceanic Flight 815's crash and wiggles <b>his</b> <b>toes,</b> realizing that {{he is no longer}} paralyzed. Boars raid the body-filled fuselage, causing Jack to decide it should be burned. The next day, the {{survivors}} discover that their food is exhausted, and wonder what to do. Locke reveals to hold many hunting knives, and suggests to go after the boar in the jungle. On his hunting mission, Locke is accompanied by Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) – who was given by Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) an antenna, which after being set will help triangulate the signal of the French transmission heard two days before – and Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau).|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1999 Don King and Oscar De la Hoya's promoter, Bob Arum, agreed to co-promote a mega-fight for the Lineal, WBC and IBF welterweight championships on September 18, 1999, at the Mandalay Bay Hotel in Las Vegas. Early in the fight De la Hoya {{employed}} boxing to connect combinations while avoiding Trinidad's attacks. The second round began with both boxers trading punches but De la Hoya quickly returned to his previous tactic, which he employed in the third round. In the fourth round Trinidad pressured the offense while De la Hoya tried to avoid his punches by moving, both boxers eventually exchanged punches. In the fifth round Trinidad continued in the offensive while De la Hoya attempted {{to remain on the}} outside corners of the ring, Trinidad's eye was swollen following a trade of punches, and his nose was also bleeding. Trinidad was having a lot of problems finding De La Hoya and couldn't connect as flush as usual with his punches, although he scored at times, Oscar's movement was not letting him land in combination and it was proclaimed by many to have been a lackluster fight. In the eighth round the swelling on Trinidad's eye was worsening. Oscar was scoring on Trinidad but halfway through the tenth, De La Hoya stopped sticking and basically disengaged. De La Hoya gassed out and had remained on <b>his</b> <b>toes</b> {{for the remainder of the}} bout, and Trinidad won all the final rounds.The judges gave Trinidad a very controversial majority decision, with scores of 115–113, 115–114 and 114–114.|$|E

25|$|The loss of <b>his</b> <b>toes</b> {{marked the}} end of Bishop's {{technical}} climbing career, and in the late 1960s he refocused his energies on academics, enrolling in the University of Chicago's Ph.D. program in geography in 1966, assisting in high-altitude physiology studies, and planning and executing the field research for his dissertation, a cultural-ecological analysis of the Karnali Zone of western Nepal. The dissertation was eventually published in 1980 and in book form as Karnali Under Stress (1990).|$|E
5000|$|On 8 January 1687, Jean-Baptiste Lully was {{conducting}} a Te Deum to celebrate Louis XIV of France's recent recovery from illness. As was the common practice, he was beating time by banging a long staff (a {{precursor to the}} baton; the French word bâton actually meaning [...] "staff") against the floor when he struck <b>his</b> <b>toe,</b> creating an abscess.

25|$|Hindlekar toured England in 1936 and 1946 as India's first-choice wicket-keeper. A {{right-handed}} batsman, he {{wore his}} cap at a 'bewildered angle' and 'stood with <b>his</b> <b>toes</b> pointing up at an angle of 45 degrees'. He opened in the First Test at Lord's in 1936, but chipped a bone in his finger and suffered from blurred vision. This injury and his subsequent exclusion from the next Test led to the famous opening partnership between Vijay Merchant and Mushtaq Ali.|$|E
25|$|The {{survivors}} of the wreck were cared for by villagers and later taken to hospital in Saint John. One {{of the men who}} had managed to climb the cliff was a Danish seaman named James Lawson. Because of his injuries and exposure to the cold, all of <b>his</b> <b>toes</b> had to be amputated. He became a shoemaker and returned to Grand Manan, where he spent {{the rest of his life}} living and working in the village of North Head. He died in 1918 at the age of 84.|$|E
25|$|He was, in any case, {{a skilled}} batsman, rarely lifting the ball {{off the surface}} while driving elegantly and adept at accumulating by {{flicking}} the ball off <b>his</b> <b>toes</b> towards fine leg. Preferring to play off the front foot, Pullar was also a good puller of the ball and could crack a square cut. In his younger days he had been compared to Charlie Hallows and Eddie Paynter, two of Lancashire's crowd pleasing greats – he had the artistry of the former and the pugnacious aggression and watchful determination of the latter.|$|E

25|$|Chesney {{started his}} Poets and Pirates Tour on April 26, 2008 at Williams-Brice Stadium in Columbia, South Carolina. During the {{introduction}} of his set, his boot got caught between a hydraulic lift and {{the lip of the}} stage surface, which crushed his foot and produced a severe hematoma from the ankle down, with most of the damage centering within <b>his</b> <b>toes.</b> It took approximately 30seconds to pry his foot loose as he squatted down on the stage while the band continued to play an extended introduction of the song. When Chesney finally freed himself, he stood up and kept holding his hand on his knee as he began singing.|$|E

He was the fastest South African to take 100 wickets in Tests (in terms of matches played) until Dale Steyn claimed the record in March 2008. He was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1956. He was known as 'Toey Tayfield' due to his habit of {{stubbing}} <b>his</b> <b>toes</b> into the ground before every delivery. He would also kiss the badge on his cap before handing it to the umpire at the start of every over.|$|E

While in college, he met Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), who graduated in second place after him, beginning a rivalry between them. He was once the interim chief of surgery while Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) was healing from his brain surgery. In season 1 it is revealed that Richard had promised him the position but instead enticed his former student, renowned neurosurgeon Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), to Seattle as he felt Burke was becoming arrogant and needed competition to keep him on <b>his</b> <b>toes.</b> He began a relationship with intern Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) but broke it off because he feared it would ruin both of their reputations. Her miscarriage brought them back together. He and Cristina lived together in his perfectly kept apartment.|$|E
25|$|Giorgio Petrosyan {{started his}} career as a -54kg/119lb bantamweight at the age of sixteen and {{defeated}} a local Italian fighter in his February 2002 debut, breaking <b>his</b> <b>toes</b> while doing so.
