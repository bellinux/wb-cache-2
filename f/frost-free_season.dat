40|$|Abstract. This paper {{explores the}} {{implications}} of changes in climatic averages and a range in precipitation levels on food production opportunities at the farm, regional and provincial levels for the province of Ontario. A doubling in atmospheric CO 2 or its equivalent would contribute to extended <b>frost-free</b> <b>seasons</b> throughout Ontario, and possibly increase year-to-year variability in precipitation. At the farm level, these changes imply greater fluctuations in annual farm profits. The benefits of longer <b>frost-free</b> <b>seasons</b> would be impaired during years with relatively low precipitation, and under these conditions, {{the security of the}} province's food supply would be at risk. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Grape vines need {{approximately}} 1300-1500 {{hours of}} sunshine {{during the growing}} season and around 690 mm of rainfall throughout the year in order to produce grapes suitable for winemaking.

The optimum weather {{during the growing season}} is a long, warm summer that allows the grapes the opportunity to ripen fully and to develop a balance between the levels of acids and sugars in the grape.Hot and sunny climates have a <b>frost-free</b> growing <b>season</b> of 200 days or more.

50|$|With {{a view to}} {{reducing}} {{the time needed to}} produce planting stock, experiments were carried out with white spruce and three other coniferous species from Wisconsin seed in the longer, <b>frost-free</b> growing <b>season</b> in Florida, 125 vs. 265 days in central Wisconsin and northern Florida, respectively. As the species studied are adapted to long photoperiods, extended daylengths of 20 hours were applied in Florida. Other seedlings were grown under extended daylength in Wisconsin and with natural daylength in both areas. After two growing seasons, white spruce under long days in Florida were about the same as those in Wisconsin, but twice as tall as plants under natural Wisconsin photoperiods. Under natural days in Florida, with the short local photoperiod, white spruce was severely dwarfed and had a low rate of survival. Black spruce responded similarly. After two growing seasons, long day plants of all 4 species in Florida were well balanced, with good development of both roots and shoots, equaling or exceeding the minimum standards for 2+1 and 2+2 outplanting stock of Lake States species. Their survival when lifted in February and outplanted in Wisconsin equalled that of 2+2 Wisconsin-grown transplants. Artificial extension of the photoperiod in the northern Lake States greatly increased height increment of white and black spruces in the second growing season.|$|R
