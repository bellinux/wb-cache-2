5|$|The house's room {{arrangement}} was planned for convenience and comfort, {{as compared to}} typical English mansions, which often were built with kitchens far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room. Woodlea has 140 rooms, which were designed not to be drafty, and with important rooms not too remote. The rooms are all over-scaled {{in terms of the}} height of the ceilings and size of the doors, with large fireplaces, and the length and breadth of the stairway to the house's second floor. The staircases have recesses with intricate decorative panels.|$|E
25|$|Hartley Mill, on the Lyde {{just above}} its {{junction}} with the Loddon, {{is now a}} residence, but the water wheel has been retained, and can be seen <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of their}} {{increased}} size the Olympic-class liners could offer many more amenities than Lusitania and Mauretania. Both Olympic and Titanic offered swimming pools, Turkish baths, a gymnasium, a squash court, large reception rooms, À la Carte restaurants separate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> saloons, {{and many more}} staterooms with private bathroom facilities than their two Cunard rivals.|$|E

50|$|Seitaad {{was first}} {{described}} by Joseph J. W. Sertich and Mark A. Loewen in 2010 {{and the type}} species is Seitaad ruessi. The generic name is derived from Séít‘áád (Navajo language), a mythological sand monster <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Diné</b> folklore who buried its victims in dunes. Seitaad {{appears to have been}} entombed by the collapse of a sand dune. The specific name honours Everett Ruess, a young artist, poet and naturalist, who mysteriously disappeared in 1934 while exploring southern Utah. Seitaad is the second basal sauropodomorph dinosaur to have been identified in North America.|$|R
50|$|Bone {{dishes are}} used to hold {{discarded}} bones <b>from</b> fish at <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> table. They are largely antiques, rarely used by modern diners.|$|R
25|$|Hearst's guests {{could drive}} in, fly in and land at an {{adjacent}} landing strip, {{or they could}} arrive by horseback after a full day's ride from San Simeon. Guests included Spencer Tracy, Dick Powell, Will Rogers, Clark Gable, Herbert Hoover, Jean Harlow, Leslie Howard and Errol Flynn. Hearst's paramour, Marion Davies, stayed {{in one of the}} four tower suites when she visited. Californio-style fiestas were thrown in the guests' honor, complete with mariachis playing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room balcony.|$|E
25|$|Freed from {{smoke and}} dirt, {{the living room}} thus began {{to serve as an}} area for social {{functions}} and increasingly became a showcase for the owner's wealth. In the upper classes, cooking and the kitchen were the domain of the servants, and the kitchen was set apart from the living rooms, sometimes even far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room. Poorer homes often did not have a separate kitchen yet; they kept the one-room arrangement where all activities took place, or at the most had the kitchen in the entrance hall.|$|E
25|$|Although the Ilmatar {{was built}} as a two-class ship, she had only one dining room that was used by both classes. Other {{facilities}} included a first-class smoking room, located one deck higher <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room. As built she had six passenger-accessible decks. The 1973 lengthening saw the addition of several new cabins, a children's playroom and a new waste processing plant. More cabins were added during a 1974 refit at the Valmet shipyard in Vuosaari. In the 1979 conversion into a cruise ship more luxurious cabins were added and a swimming pool was constructed on the rear deck.|$|E
50|$|Conductor Thomas Reynolds of North Bay made {{a daring}} escape <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{submerged}} <b>dining</b> car into <b>the</b> freezing water.

25|$|The four terrorists stormed {{into the}} ship's dining room. They shot their {{automatic}} weapons {{over the heads}} of the eating passengers. Screams from the passengers meshed with the shouting of the gunmen and with the sound of falling glass shards and splinters. Viola Meskin tried to run to a door but was intercepted by a terrorist with a gun who turned her back. Austrian passenger Anna Hoeranter ran to an exit but was pushed down an adjacent flight of stairs by one of the terrorists. Other passengers ran in a panic <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room into the kitchen and were chased by one of the terrorists. Inside the kitchen the pursuing terrorist beat two of the kitchen staff to the floor.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Simpson asks Poirot {{to help in}} the {{investigation}} of a painting by Rubens which was stolen from the gallery that he owns. A group of unemployed men were paid to carry out a demonstration in the gallery which, once it was cleared by the police, was found to have been a diversion to enable the picture to be cut out of its frame. Simpson knows the picture is being transported to France where it will be bought by a millionaire collector and he wants Poirot to assist as he thinks he will be better at dealing with an unscrupulous rich man than the police will be. Poirot reluctantly agrees to help. He is far more interested in a case that Japp has about Winnie King, a fifteen-year-old English girl who was being escorted to Paris as one of a party of such girls for the new term at Miss Pope's exclusive school there. On the way back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> car of the train, just after it left Amiens (the last stop before Paris), Winnie King went into the toilet and seemingly vanished. No body has been found {{by the side of the}} tracks and the train made no other stops, only slowing down for a signal; however, Winnie's hat was later recovered near the tracks. Poirot asks if her shoes have been found.|$|E
500|$|The Church {{acknowledged}} that the rules under which the Headleys lived included a ban on having children, censored mail, monitored phone calls, needing permission to have Internet access and being disciplined through manual labor. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals noted in a ruling given in July 2012 that Marc Headley {{had been made to}} clean human excrement by hand from an aeration pond on the compound with no protective equipment, while Claire Headley was banned <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> hall for up to eight months in 2002. She lost [...] as a result of subsisting on protein bars and water. In addition, she was coerced into having two abortions to comply with the Sea Org's no-children policy. The Headleys also experienced physical violence from Scientology executives and saw others being treated violently.|$|E
50|$|Jazz artists {{played on}} the ground floor, on a raised stage along one wall, beneath a multi-faceted disco ball. The stage could also be watched <b>from</b> <b>the</b> balcony <b>dining</b> area. Musicians had a green room at the back and at times stayed in apartments on the floor above.|$|R
60|$|Tallente {{threw off}} his rain and mud-soaked clothes, bathed, changed and descended to <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room {{just as the}} gong sounded.

50|$|The chapel has leadlight lancet windows {{along the}} south wall, and a lancet-shaped timber-panelled door which opens into a small vestry at the {{southwest}} end. The chapel is separated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> original <b>dining</b> room by folding timber (cedar) doors, which can be opened to extend {{the area of the}} chapel. There is a fine marble fireplace-surround with early tiles in <b>the</b> former <b>dining</b> room, and an early hearth and grate.|$|R
500|$|Because of a {{potential}} liability for £10,000 of renovation work upon the expiry of the lease, Betjeman considered the house too costly to maintain, and subsequently vacated it. From 1962 to 1966, the house stood empty and suffered vandalism and neglect. [...] A survey undertaken in January 1965 revealed that the exterior stonework was badly decayed, dry rot had eaten through the roof and the structural floor timbers, and the attics were infested with pigeons. Vandals had stripped the lead from the water tanks and had damaged the mirrors, fireplaces and carving work. The most notable loss was the theft of the carved figure of Fame <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dining</b> Room chimneypiece. Betjeman suggested that the owner's agents had deliberately refused to let the house, and allowed it to decline, intending to demolish it and redevelop the site. Writing in Country Life in 1966, Charles Handley-Read took a different view saying that [...] "the Ilchester Estate, upon which the house is situated, are anxious {{that it should be}} preserved and [...] entered into a long lease conditional upon the house being put into a state of good repair." [...] In March 1965, the Historic Buildings Council obtained a preservation order on the house, enabling the purchaser of the lease, Lady Jane Turnbull, daughter of William Grey, 9th Earl of Stamford, to initiate a programme of restoration the following July. These renovations were supported by grants of £4,000 from the Historic Buildings Council and £3,000 from the Greater London Council. [...] The lease was sold in 1969.|$|E
2500|$|The hotel's {{interior}} {{consists of}} a hallway {{which leads to a}} lobby, a lounge, the lone interior guest room, and a 128-capacity dining room (the dining room is in the stem of the [...] "T"). [...] The rear kitchen wing is accessible <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room and from the outside. [...] Along with the kitchen, the rear wing includes a room once reserved for the hotel's cook. [...] Private baths were added to most of the guest rooms in the 1950s.|$|E
2500|$|Further {{towards the}} stern on the boiler deck was the ladies saloon, which {{included}} six rooms, painted {{in a different}} color <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room. [...] One of the rooms had been fitted up as a ladies toilet, in which the pumps kept “continuous jets of water playing, while the boat is in motion, so that no offensive effluvia taints these sumptuous cabins.” [...] During winter, this area was heated by a steam radiator covered a marble slab. [...] At night the room was lit by nickel-plated lamps.|$|E

2500|$|Before {{the house}} was {{demolished}} a sale was held {{and parts of the}} house were re-used elsewhere. [...] The large chimneypiece <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> room went to form part of the entrance to what is now a restaurant in Borough Road, Birkenhead. [...] Another immense fireplace was reused at [...] Portmeirion as the main facade of a building, the Pantheon. [...] Parts of other chimneypieces went to private houses in Heswall and Bebington, and other piece s went to Llandudno, and to Iwerne Minster House, in Dorset. [...] A smaller house was later built on the site.|$|E
2500|$|Abdel-Rahman {{traveled}} {{widely in}} the United States and Canada. Despite U.S. {{support for the}} mujahideen in Afghanistan, Abdel-Rahman was deeply anti-American, and spoke out against the country. He issued a fatwa in the US that declared it lawful to rob banks and kill Jews in the US. His sermons condemned Americans as the [...] "descendants of apes and pigs who have been feeding <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> tables of the Zionists, Communists, and colonialists". He called on Muslims to assail the West, [...] "cut the transportation of their countries, tear it apart, destroy their economy, burn their companies, eliminate their interests, sink their ships, shoot down their planes, kill them on the sea, air, or land".|$|E
2500|$|From {{the turn}} of the 20th century, {{interior}} woodwork, including complete panelled rooms and staircases and fittings such as chimneypieces secured an avid market among rich Americans. In rare cases, complete houses were disassembled, stone by stone, and reassembled in the US; an example is Agecroft Hall, a Lancashire house sold at auction in 1925, dismantled, crated and shipped across the Atlantic, and then reassembled in Richmond, Virginia. The Carolean staircase from Cassiobury Park has come to rest in the Metropolitan Museum of Art as have elements to reassemble [...] "period rooms", including the Rococo stuccoed plasterwork <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dining</b> Room of the Dashwood seat, Kirtlington Park, the tapestry room from Croome Court and the dining room by Robert Adam from Lansdowne House, London, where the incidence of lost great residences is higher, naturally enough, than anywhere in the countryside.|$|E

50|$|The Quakers in Great Ayton {{set aside}} {{part of the}} meeting house as an 'Old Scholars' room {{containing}} many items selected by Old Scholars to be retained as mementoes of the School.

2500|$|Holidays and [...] "life event" [...] celebrations, from birthdays to wakes include {{multiple}} family customs, either superimposed {{upon the}} more broadly defined societal celebrations, or substituting for them. This is seen most obviously in traditions {{found in the}} preparation and [...] "performance" [...] of a holiday meal. Each family has their own unique traditions, from special dishes prepared only for this dinner, to a single individual who prepares and presents this single dish, to the individual assigned to carve the bird. It is unnecessary to mention examples of this; each North American reader is mentally reviewing the Thanksgiving traditions unique to his own family. This list of special holiday traditions in the family expands easily <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> table to the family wake-up calls to the distribution of presents under the Christmas tree or Hanukah lights. Each of these, along with countless other details, distinguish this family as a unique social unit.|$|E
2500|$|Until 1993, weekday dinners at Trinity College were {{punctuated by}} the {{tradition}} of [...] "Poorings Out". This tradition was a tongue-in-cheek way of imposing [...] "discipline" [...] on errant male members of college. The name [...] "Pooring out" [...] relates to the [...] "poor" [...] behaviour of the targeted student. Often spurious or humorous reasons would be given for a pooring out. Under this tradition, members of second year would attempt to expel an [...] "errant" [...] student <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>dining</b> hall during the first 15 minutes of dinner. The targeted student would lie across the dinner table, and was usually defended by three fellow students who linked {{together to form a}} strong a defensive shell over the table and on top of the targeted student. Upon a publicly announced [...] "call" [...] as to the alleged transgression, the assembled members of second year would stampede from their seats to the defenders, where they were given one minute to pull the targeted student off the table. On the rare occasion that a defence did prevail for more than one minute, the defendant was permitted to leave the dining hall on his own feet. Otherwise, the head of second year (or delegate) would drag the defendant out of the hall.|$|E
2500|$|Thus it {{was that}} in 1929 Basildon Park was {{purchased}} by a property developer, George Ferdinando. who bought the estate as park land. George Ferdinando was 65 when he bought the house and as his children were grown up his wife was unwilling to take on another large house and so he produced a sales notice, the idea being {{to sell the house}} as one lot in America. Encouraged by the then current fashion amongst wealthy American citizens for inhabiting ancient European houses and palazzi, Ferdinando produced a sales brochure advertising Basildon to any American citizen for $1,000,000. For this sum, he promised to [...] "carefully take it down" [...] and [...] "re-erect in America", thus providing an opportunity to [...] "Any patriotic American wishing to benefit his native state by presenting this imposing building … ready for occupation as a private residence, museum, college building or public library." [...] Fortunately he {{had a change of heart}} and decided instead to convert the old sawmill at the top of the park into a house for himself and his wife. George also persuaded one of his sons Eric to return from America where he was a cotton grower with his young family to live in the south pavilion then called the east wing. Eric then oversaw the return of fixtures and fittings such as the stair balustrade, the renovation and running of the house and estate. No evidence is available to say whether it was George Ferdinando, the first Lord Iliffe or the executors of the Morrison estate who sold off the dining room fixtures. However elements <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dining</b> Room have been reused in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York and doorcases designed by John Carr are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, [...] the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, and the Louisiana State University Museum of Art.|$|E

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study seeks {{to determine the}} critical elements and activities that comprise the cultural history of <b>Dine</b> College as <b>the</b> first tribally controlled college in the United States. An oral history methodology utilizing a narrative Dine "story-telling" inquiry approach allowed this study to blend stories, songs, prayers, and ceremonies <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dine</b> creation stories to challenge a host of social, educational, and cultural issues which <b>the</b> <b>Dine</b> people confronted in establishing the first post-secondary educational institution on tribal land, {{owned and operated by}} tribal people. Goals of this institution were to prepare students for further academic studies, employment, and culturally astuteness. Cultural history reflects the traditional stories, songs, prayers, and ceremonies of a people, and is used here to reconstruct {{the events of the past}} to gain a fair, accurate, and objective understanding of Dine College's unique philosophy of Sa'ah Naaghai Bik'eh Hozhoon and its related components: Nitsahakees-Thinking, Nahata-Planning, Iina-Living and Siih Hasin-Achievement. Through oral history narratives of four key Navajo individuals who were directly and indirectly involved in the College's founding, five key themes are revealed: land, leadership, mission, philosophy, and curriculum. They converge together to weave the cultural history of Dine College...|$|R
