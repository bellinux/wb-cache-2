Acorns, particularly, were good and <b>fattening</b> <b>feed.</b> They ate cedar and juniper berries, and pinyon nuts. And {{therefore}} they lived off the land, at little or no expense to the owner. The only loss was from beasts and birds of prey. Glenn showed Carley how a profitable business could soon be established. He meant to fence off side canyons and to segregate droves of his hogs, and to raise abundance of corn for winter feed. At that {{time there was a}} splendid market for hogs, a condition Hutter claimed would continue indefinitely in a growing country. In conclusion Glenn eloquently told how in his necessity he had accepted gratefully the humblest of labors, to find in the hard pursuit of it a rejuvenation of body and mind, and a promise of independence and prosperity.|$|E

In traditional sheep <b>fattening,</b> <b>feeds</b> are always provided ad-hoc and in an unregulated fashion, which is rather wasteful. As a preliminary study to establish the optimal feeding levels of groundnut haulms for profitable sheep <b>fattening,</b> a <b>feeding</b> trial was conducted for 70 days with four levels of groundnut haulms (0, 150, 300 and 450 g/day) and a basal diet of bush hay. The effects of supplementation with groundnut haulms on feed intake, water consumption, live weight changes and economic return were determined. Twenty-four Peuhl Oudah rams with average initial weight of 28. 6 kg (SD = 1. 4) were randomly allocated to four treatments defined by the four levels of groundnut haulms in the diet.

40|$|A profit {{function}} {{was designed for}} an industrial commercial rabbitry with the most common management in industrial rabbit production. The incomes, costs, and profit function were calculated and economic weights of the traits were estimated. The variable costs (feeding, artificial insemination, health and replacement) represented 62 % of the total costs, and the fixed costs (labour, utilities, amortisation and administration) represented 38 % of the total costs. Major costs were feeding of fattening kits and labour cost, at 26 % and 18 % of the total cost, respectively. The economic weights were feed conversion rate during fattening (– 20. 2 €/[g feed/g liveweight]), number of kits born alive (15. 7 €/kit), pregnancy rate (1. 7 €/percentage unit), weaning survival (1. 7 €/percentage unit), fattening survival (2. 0 €/percentage unit), daily feed intake (– 0. 50 €/(g feed/d)), daily gain during fattening (1. 33 €/(g weight/d)), and replacement rate (– 0. 29 €/percentage unit). When varying the prices of kg of <b>fattening</b> <b>feed</b> and kg of liveweight, only the economic weights of feed conversion rate during fattening {{in the first case}} and the number of kits born alive in the second case changed considerably.

40|$|Abstract. In this study, ewes of “Merinolandschaf”, a breed {{widespread}} in southern Germany, were crossed with rams of five meat breed types (Ile de France, Charollais, German black-headed mutton sheep (Deutsches Schwarzköpfiges Fleischschaf), Suffolk, Texel) and Merinolandschaf rams. The resulting lambs (179 individu-als) were fattened intensively from 55. 3 days and body weight of 20. 4 kg until 121. 7 days and a weight of 40. 9 kg. While <b>fattening,</b> <b>feed</b> intake was recorded and lambs were weighed weekly. Ile de France×Merinolandschaf and Texel×Merinolandschaf {{seem to be}} of greatest economic interest for intensive fattening because they showed the best feed conversion rate and energetic feed conversion rate. Only these crosses were significantly superior compared to purebred Merinolandschaf in feed conversion rate and also in daily body weight gain during the fattening period. Except Charollais×Merinolandschaf, all crosses showed at least a tendency of improvement in all three traits compared to Merinolandschaf, although {{this is not always}} significant. This underlines the ad-vantage of one-way cross-breeding for efficiently producing lamb meat. The growth was modelled with a linear model and the Gompertz model. The results showed that both models fit the data well, although the average R 2 was slightly higher and the average mean square error was slightly lower for the Gompertz model. In addition, the use of the Gompertz model provided some interesting biological insights concerning the growth of lambs and differences between the crosses, even though the lambs were slaughtered before reaching their mature body weight. ...|$|E

The study involved survey to assess cattle fattening and marketing practices, and action research to evaluate the effect of homemade concentrate from locally available <b>feed</b> resources on <b>fattening</b> performance and economic return of indigenous cattle. The survey part involved interviewing 120 households purposively selected from six kebeles in three agro ecologies. Focus group discussions and key informants have been employed to enrich the data. The feeding trial was conducted in Danible Ottora Kebele,with 18 (9 castrate and 9 non – castrate) indigenous cattle for 70 days excluding adaptation period of 15 days. Treatments included farmer’s practices alone (T 1); T 1 + concentrate supplementation at 1 % of body weight (T 2); and T 1 + concentrate supplementation at 1. 5 % of body weight (T 3). Maize stover and stubble grazing was provided as a basic ration which was the farmers feeding practice. Experimental animals were blocked by farms/households and randomly assigned to three feeding treatments separately. Heart girth and body condition score were recorded while body weight was estimated from heart girth using regression equation developed for zebu cattle. The data were analyzed using the General Linear Model Procedure of statistical package for Social Science (SPSS 16). The result showed that the most dominant cattle breed used for fattening in the study area was indigenous. The major source of cattle for fattening was through purchasing from market (69. 1 %) followed by raising at home (24. 2 %). Almost all fatteners in highland (95 %) and mid-altitude (100 %) were engaged in fattening castrate. Concerning physiological stage of the fattening animals, most of the producers (83 %) use matured & old oxen. In highland, majority of the farmers fatten cattle once within a year (60 %), while it was three times per year for mid-altitude (42. 5 %) and two times per year for lowland (70 %) agro-ecologies. The majority (90 %) {{of the respondents indicated that}} the most common criteria used to decide fattening period was body condition of the animals. Majority of the respondents in the highland, mid altitude and lowland fatten cattle for six months, three months and five months, respectively. The major types of feed resources for the fattening animal were natural pasture, crop residues, stubble grazing, grass hay and feed supplements. The major criteria used while purchasing fattening cattle included frame size, heath, body condition, coat color and price of animals. The experience in cattle fattening, large cattle population, diverse & suitable agroecology, availability of crop residues, high irrigation potential, initiation of the introduction of improved forage species and cheap labor force reveals the potential of the area for improved cattle <b>fattening.</b> However, <b>feed</b> shortage, shortage of land, prevalence of disease, poor access for credit service and marketing information, and underdeveloped cattle marketing were the major constraints that hinder the performance of cattle <b>fattening.</b> The <b>feeding</b> trial showed that average daily gain were highest (p< 0. 05) for animals supplemented with T 3 followed by T 2 and T 1. Similarly, the net return was higher (P< 0. 05) for the supplemented group (T 2 & T 3) compared to non-supplemented group kept under farmers management (T 1). Among the supplemented groups, marginal rate of return was higher for animals supplemented with T 2 compared to T 3. Thus, it can be concluded that when resources are not meager smallholders producers could use supplementation at 1. 5 % of body weight for higher return. However, when resources are limited producers are advised to supplement at 1 % of body weight for higher marginal rate of return. Detail research work on availability, nutrient composition and digestibility of the major feed resource are recommended for further work. Global Affairs Canad...|$|R
5000|$|Leopard geckos are ectothermic. They absorb {{warmth and}} energy {{during the day}} as they are sleeping, so they can hunt and digest food at night. In addition, they have short legs, which enable them to be quick and agile while their small nails allow them to climb twigs and rocks. Leopard geckos have {{openings}} {{on either side of}} their head as ears. A tympanic membrane covers and protects it. They use their ears to locate their prey.Healthy leopard geckos have thick, fleshy tails; a thin tail is an indication that the gecko is not healthy and may be lacking good health. Although, when in captivity, the tail can be <b>fattened</b> by the <b>feeding</b> of waxworms (wax moth larvae), these worms are typically too fatty for the gecko to get the nutritional value it needs. They can also be fed [...] "pinkies", a one-day-old mouse to fatten up the tail, but again, these are very low in nutritional value. Breeders recommend coating crickets in a nutritional powder before serving them either live or dead. Leopard geckos' thick tails can regenerate when lost; however, the regenerated tails appear stumpy and never have the same appearance as the original tail.|$|R

Introduction: We say art {{of feeding}} because {{we intend to}} treat to treat the subject from the {{standpoint}} of the successful administration of the details which go to make the business profitable. We say that successful steer feeding is an art which cannot be attained by all, since a successful feeder must be acquainted with animals, feed, markets and above all must be possessed of rare insight and judgment that will enable him to solve many problems that arise. Cattle feeding has been indulged in from time immemorial. We are told of the killing of the fattened cattle on the return of prodigal. In early biblical history the burnt offerings were made from the fattling of the flocks and herds. Although no record is given as to the particular manner of <b>fattening</b> yet <b>feeding</b> must have been carried on in some form. The feeds used at that period were probably barley, flax and other grains that were native of that country. Some of the tribes of Israel were noted for their large herds and flocks and must necessarily have had some method of feeding. Tin modern times the business has become one of enormous magnitude involving millions of dollars’ worth of property and has for its ultimate end the furnishing of food for millions of people. Texas alone, according to the census of 1900, had 9, 595, 611 head of cattle, and a greater majority of the states have over half a million head within their borders. Thus the boundless resources of this business. The net worth of this industry amounts to startling figures. These statements give us something of an idea of the extent of responsibility that rests on those engaged in the occupation of steer feeding. The practical destination of all cattle is the block and as to the degree of excellence with which they should meet this end is determined by the feeder...|$|R

Animals were {{distributed}} into three feeding groups with different maize silage to concentrate ratios (670 : 330 = F/ HC; 750 : 250 = F/ LC 1; 800 : 200 = F/ LC 2) based on dry matter. The low concentrate groups (F/ LC 1 and F/ LC 2) received linseed supplemented concentrate during the <b>fattening</b> period. <b>Feeding</b> high concentrate (F/ HC) caused the significantly highest daily gain. The slaughter weights, dressing (%), lean (%) and fat (%) {{did not show}} any significant differences between feeding groups. Carcass conformation of all groups was assessed mainly as U. Bulls of group F/ LC 2 had the lowest amount of kidney fat. Bone proportion of the carcasses was affected by the diet (F/ HC: 18. 65 %; F/ LC 1 : 18. 41 %; F/ LC 2 : 17. 91 %). The tendon proportions were lower in groups F/ LC 1 and F/ LC 2 but not significantly (F/ HC: 1. 15 %; F/ LC 1 : 1. 1 %; F/ LC 2 : 1. 08 %). The intramuscular fat content varied between the three muscles investigated. Psoas major muscle contained the highest fat concentration in all three feeding groups. The mineral content of muscles (iron [Fe], copper [Cu], zinc [Zn]) was only affected by muscle type, but not by diet. In linseed supplemented groups (F/ LC 1 and F/ LC 2) the palmitic acid and palmitoleic acid proportion was decreased (P n - 3 fatty acid (P< 0. 05) was increased compared to the F/ HC group.

40|$|The {{effects of}} two {{different}} initial ages of fattening on the weight gain, feed intake and feed efficiency characteristics as well as carcass and non-carcass components of the native Eastern Anatolian Red cattle raised in Eastern region of Turkey were studied in this research. According to the age {{at the beginning of}} the fattening, 61 EAR male cattle was allocated into two age treatment groups named as group I (9 - 14 months of ages) and group II (17 - 22 months of ages). Total weight gain throughout the fattening was numerically greater in younger group compared with the elderly group, however, the difference was not statistically significant. Total dry alfalfa hay and concentrate intake as dry matter did not differ significantly between age groups. However, feed efficiency ratios were significantly (p< 0. 01) influenced by initial age of the fattening in favour of younger EAR cattle. Carcass cutability and yield grade values of the EAR cattle in group I did not differ significantly from those in group II. Overall results of the study revealed that as initial age of the fattening lowers, <b>fattening</b> performance and <b>feed</b> efficiency ratio of EAR male cattle improved, but, carcass quality traits were not adversely influenced...|$|R
40|$|Ninety bull calves of five Bonsmara strains, viz. Edelheer (E), T- 49 (T), Wesselsvlei (W), Roodebos (R) and Belmont Red (BR), and two Nguni sub-populations, viz. Bartlow (B) and non-Bartlow (NB), were <b>fattened</b> under {{intensive}} <b>feeding</b> {{conditions and}} serially slaughtered at four different slaughter weights. Phylogenetic {{relationships between the}} five Bonsmara strains and between the two Nguni subpopulations were determined by means of blood typing. Growth performance, carcass characteristics and meat quality characteristics were compared between the sub-populations of each breed. Genetic distances between the Bonsmara animals confirmed the existence of five genetic subpopulations with variation in genetic distances between them. The genetic distance between the two Nguni subpopulations was very small, indicating genetic similarity. Means for production and product characteristics were adjusted for mean subcutaneous fat percentage by means of analysis of covariance. T gained weight faster and more efficiently on a live and carcass weight basis than the other Bonsmara groups, while B gained carcass and muscle weight more efficiently than NB. T had proportionally more meat in the high-priced cuts of the carcass than W. Muscle of the W line had a higher ageing potential (measured as myofibrillar fragmentation; MFI) than T, resulting in higher tenderness scores for W. Similarly, B had higher MFI for muscle aged for one or seven days, coupled with more tender meat than NB. Pairwise correlations between growth and muscle characteristics indicated that fast growing animals tend to produce less tender meat...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the feeding and economic value of cassava starch by-products as source of energy in diets for growing fattening pigs. Cassava starch by-products were incorporated in the diets at 0 (treatment 1, control), 10 (treatment 2), 20 (treatment 3) and 30 % (treatment 4). Each treatment had three replicates arranged as unbalanced incomplete block design. Pigs fed treatment 4 had the highest (p< 0. 05) feed intake (23. 05), body weight gain (62. 90) and growth efficiency (2. 06) than those given treatment 1, 2 and 3 whose results were; feed intake (16. 48, 10. 49 and 8. 02), body weight gain (42. 77, 21. 94 and 6. 25) and growth efficiency (1. 57, 0. 74 and 0. 26) respectively. Feed conversion ratios (3. 25, 7. 16 and 3. 88) for treatments 1, 2 and 4 respectively, were similar but were different from treatment 3 which had a feed conversion ratio of 17. 04. Back fat thickness (3. 36, 1. 50 and 4. 65), for treatments 1, 3 and 4 respectively, were significantly (p< 0. 05) different. This study therefore, showed that replacement of maize with 30 % cassava starch by-products in diets of growing <b>fattening</b> pigs improve <b>feed</b> intake, body weight gain, feed conversion ratio and growth efficiency than replacement of maize with 10 % and 20 % cassava by products.
