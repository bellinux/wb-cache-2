5000|$|Baťa's Skyscraper (Baťův mrakodrap, Jednadvacítka) {{was built}} as the {{headquarters}} for the worldwide Baťa organization. Designed by Vladimír Karfík, the huge building was erected in 1936-1939. It included a room-sized <b>elevator</b> <b>housing</b> the office for the boss, comfortably furnished - with a sink, a telephone and air conditioning. When it was built it was the tallest Czechoslovak building (77.5 m). After a costly reconstruction in 2004, it became {{the seat of the}} Zlín Region and the headquarters of the tax office.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the unusual}} {{configuration}} of the lot and the building, the unadorned brick side and rear walls are highly visible. The {{north side of the}} building, which is the largest, contains a number of window openings close to the Park Row facade, but few window openings near the rear of the building at Theatre Alley. The top story of the building, just beneath the towers, has minimal ornamentation {{in the form of a}} series of engaged pilasters between blind brick walls. A round, faceted addition for the <b>elevator</b> <b>housing</b> was added above this level in 1940.|$|E

40|$|This is {{a record}} of a {{collaborative}} teaching effort of two architect/educators, each contributing theoretical components to the educational process necessary {{for the development of}} an urban housing strategy vis  vis an integrated digital/judgment effort. Twenty graduate architecture students were involved in this “computer design studioi. The focus of the studio was the 1997 Otis <b>Elevator</b> <b>Housing</b> Design Competition. A prerequisite introductory computer class was required for participation in this studio. Two distinct analysis and design methodologies were introduced, one concentrating on the formal tectonic aspects of architecture and the other highlighting the multiplicity, and often competing, forces shaping the built reality. The summary offered at the conclusion of this document both supports and questions the direction of the class as a whole and further classifies the relative success and failures of the individual student initiatives. In some cases, the computer simply facilitated (and occasionally hindered) progress. In the most opportunistic examples, the computer undoubtedly changed both the process and the consequence of the design effort. ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} examine how the {{conversion}} of grain <b>elevators</b> into <b>housing</b> is an effective method of adaptive reuse. It uses theories and concepts on heritage preservation, downtown revitalization, place theory and environmental sustainability. Based on the literature review, {{there is a need}} for change in planning policy and there are both advantages and disadvantages to adaptive reuse. The methodology and data sources include examining and analyzing planning documents, surveys for the public and professionals, and demographic data. Case studies included converted grain elevators located in Australia and Norway and also a case study in Canada for the purpose of future recommendations. These methods answer the research question of how do planning policies and the perspectives of planning professionals and the public affect the process of the adaptive reuse of grain <b>elevators</b> into <b>housing?</b> Subsequent questions include topics such as whether adaptive reuse is an effective approach to downtown revitalization, which policies impede or facilitate the process, how perspectives influence decisions, and how demographics are linked to housing availability. The significance of this study on planning practice is that it helps form policy recommendations to address the needs of the public and help improve the efficiency of adaptive reuse in the planning process. In conclusion, the public and professionals were generally in favour of this type of adaptive reuse but many had concerns about cost and gentrification. Also, more policies need to be created that address adaptive reuse specifically. For the future use of the Toronto case study I recommended that converting the grain <b>elevator</b> into <b>housing</b> is the optimal choice. The limitations of this study include data availability, non-responses for surveys, language barriers, case study locations, and time constraints...|$|R

50|$|Márkus soon {{continued}} {{his career as}} a journalist. He was an author of the progressive Reform daily newspaper, before joining as a columnist responsible for Budapest affairs to the Nemzeti Hírlap, edited by István Toldy, in 1873. In that capacity, Márkus began increasingly interested in politics and administration of Budapest. Due to the encouragement of his uncle, he took a draftsman traineeship at the Budapest City Hall in 1875. After a few months, he was appointed assistant clerk by Mayor Károly Kamermayer in 1876, thus Márkus became a direct employee to the mayor. In 1879, he was appointed notary at the city council's meetings. He {{played a major role in}} the establishment of the <b>Elevator</b> <b>House</b> and several other warehouses in the early 1880s, as a result he was awarded the Crowned Gold Cross of Merit by King Francis Joseph in 1884. Following this success, he was promoted to Chief Notary of Budapest on 1 April 1885. He was elected a councillor to the Municipal Local Board of the General Assembly of Budapest five years later, on 1 April 1890, he was the youngest person who held the dignity during that time. In that capacity, he chaired the Finance and Economy Department.|$|R

5000|$|Although, {{there were}} a few railway workers who lived there from 1916 to the late 1920s, the area was mainly settled in 1929 by Polish {{immigrants}} from the Vermilion area who had fled Poland after Russian invaded following World War I. In the fall of 1929, a store was opened by Andrew and Cathy Hancharyk on the NW quarter of Section 27, Township 74, Range 5, West of the 6th Meridian. A post office opened there on October 15, 1929, with Andrew as postmaster. [...] “Across the street from the store was the butchershop and café”. The community included ”two livery barns… a single elevator which served an area as far away as Heart Valley… an <b>elevator</b> <b>house,</b> and a water tank for the train.” Across the creek was the Webster Sawmill. In 1930, a large Catholic Church was erected. This also served as a school-room for Torun School District 4483, approved on March 20, 1930, until the school was built in 1937. In the late 1930s, Webster Hall was built for community gatherings and a rectory was added for the first resident Catholic priest. The elevator was the first community building lost by fire, then the church in the early 1960s. In 1957, Torun School closed and the students were vanned to Sexsmith. The post office closed in 1966, and all that remained were the hall and the Catholic grotto which had been erected beside the church, as well as the Webster Cemetery.|$|R
