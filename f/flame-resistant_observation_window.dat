40|$|Although the Optical Transport Network, {{based on}} {{technologies}} such as Wavelength Division Multiplexing and Optical Cross-Connects, offers tremendous transportation capacity, its management requires frequent manual intervention. However, as the traffic pattern offered to today's transport networks is subject to continuous changes due to the Internet traffic dominance, an optical transport network with a smart, automatic and real-time control system, denoted as Intelligent Optical Network (ION) or Automatic Switched Optical Network (ASON), is desired by network operators. Duly and correctly retrieving the changing traffic load information {{is a very important}} factor for the successful deployment of an ION. In this paper, we discuss the influence of the <b>observation</b> <b>window</b> size used for collecting the traffic load information, on the performance of an ION. By comparing the performance of an ION using different traffic <b>observation</b> <b>window</b> sizes, we show that a smaller <b>observation</b> <b>window</b> harms the network stability; while a too large <b>observation</b> <b>window</b> worsens the network reliability.

We {{show that the}} influence of the rectangular <b>observation</b> <b>window</b> employed by all considered NSE schemes can be described by the same nonrecursive amplitude and phase reference symbols. In order to increase the computational efficiency, we propose an infinite but exponentially decaying observa-tion window. In this case, the reference symbols can be generated in a recursive way. We investigate how the performance of the considered NSE schemes is in-fluenced by the type of <b>observation</b> <b>window</b> used, the <b>observation</b> <b>window</b> size, and reduced–state decoding. 1...|$|R

30|$|While the {{existence}} of cyclic prefix in OFDM signal makes the detection and classification of OFDM signal much easier, in reality the signal detector/classifier sometimes needs to make decision in a short <b>observation</b> time <b>window.</b> When this <b>observation</b> <b>window</b> is shorter than the duration of one OFDM symbol, cyclic prefix {{is not included in}} the <b>observation</b> <b>window.</b> Hence, since there are numerous efficient algorithms to detect and classify an OFDM signal based on its cyclic prefix {{through the use of a}} simple autocorrelation procedure [21 – 23], we focus on the case of an OFDM signal transmitted with no cyclic prefix. Therefore, an intermediate stage is needed between the SOF-based classifications and the HOCS-based classifications.|$|R
