Forsdyke. [...] Before the discovery of RGS proteins, the duration of heterotrimeric G-protein signaling was thought to be modulated by only two factors: the intrinsic GTP <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>rate</b> of the Gα subunit and acceleration of that rate by some specialized Gα effectors (i.e., phospholipase C-beta isoforms). What Siderovski originally identified as the G0S8-homology ("GH") domain in proteins from several eukaryotic genomes (human, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is now known as the [...] "RGS domain", an approximately 130 amino-acid domain that contacts the Gα switch regions to stabilize the transition state, thus accelerating GTP hydrolysis (i.e., RGS proteins act as GTPase-accelerating proteins or “GAPs” for Gα-GTP; e.g., ref.). Discovery of a superfamily of RGS domain-containing proteins that negatively regulate Gα-dependent signaling resolved a prior paradox that GPCR-stimulated signals are seen to terminate much faster in vivo than predicted from the slow GTP hydrolysis rates exhibited by purified Gα subunits in vitro. RGS proteins are now considered key desensitizers of heterotrimeric G protein signaling and, as such, as new drug discovery targets. This foundational work by Siderovski on a new class of GPCR signaling regulators has been cited over 17,000 times according to Google Scholar and also resulted in Siderovski editing a two-volume set of Methods in Enzymology chapters devoted to these regulatory proteins.|$|E

40|$|Efficient {{hydrolysis}} of cellulose-to-glucose {{is critically}} important in pro-ducing fuels and chemicals from renewable feedstocks. Cellulose hydrolysis in aqueous media suffers from slow reaction rates because cellulose is a water-insoluble crystalline biopolymer. The high-crystallinity of cellulose fib-rils renders the internal surface of cellulose inaccessible to the hydrolyzing enzymes (cellulases) as well as water. Pretreatment methods, which increase the surface area accessible to water and cellulases are vital to improving the hydrolysis kinetics and conversion of cellulose to glucose. In a novel tech-nique, the microcrystalline cellulose was first subjected to an ionic liquid (IL) treatment and then recovered as essentially amorphous or as a mixture of amorphous and partially crystalline cellulose by rapidly quenching the solu-tion with an antisolvent. Because of their extremely low-volatility, ILs {{are expected to have}} minimal environmental impact. Two different ILs, 1 -n-butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride (BMIMCl) and 1 -allyl- 3 -methylimidazolium chloride (AMIMCl) were investigated. Hydrolysis kinetics of the IL-treated cellulose is significantly enhanced. With appropriate selection of IL treatment conditions and enzymes, the initial <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>rates</b> for IL-treated cellulose were up to 90 times greater than those of untreated cellulose. We infer that this drastic improvement in the “overall <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>rates</b> ” with IL-treated cellu-lose is mainly because of a significant enhancement in the kinetics of the “pri-mary hydrolysis step ” (conversion of solid cellulose to soluble oligomers), which is the rate-limiting step for untreated cellulose.

Reduced enzyme activities caused by low water activities can explain this DH% limitation. Finally, a possible influence of the plastein reaction on the DH% limitation is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Marine snow {{aggregates}} {{are heavily}} colonized by heterotrophic microorganisms that express {{high levels of}} hydrolytic activities, making aggregates hotspots for carbon remineralization in the ocean. To assess how aggregate formation influences the ability of seawater microbial communities to access organic carbon, we compared <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>rates</b> of six polysaccharides in coastal seawater after aggregates had been formed (via incubation on a roller table) with <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>rates</b> in seawater from the same site that had not incubated on a roller table (referred to as whole seawater). <b>Hydrolysis</b> <b>rates</b> in the aggregates themselves were up to three orders of magnitude higher on a volume basis than in whole seawater. The enhancement of enzyme activity in aggregates relative to whole seawater differed by substrate, suggesting that the enhancement was under cellular control, rather than due to factors such as lysis or grazing. A comparison of <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>rates</b> in whole seawater with those in aggregate-free seawater, i. e. the fraction {{of water from the}} roller bottles that did not contain aggregates, demonstrated a nuanced microbial response to aggregate formation. Activities of laminarinase and xylanase enzymes in aggregate-free seawater were higher than in whole seawater, while activities of chondroitin, fucoidan, and arabinogalactan hydrolyzing enzymes were lower than in whole seawater. These data suggest that aggregate formation enhanced production of laminarinase and xylanase enzymes, and the enhancement also affected the surrounding seawater. Decreased activities of chondroitin, fucoidan, and arabinoglactan-hydrolyzing enzymes in aggregate-free seawater relative to whole seawater are likely due to shifts in enzyme production by the aggregate-associated community, coupled with the effects of enzyme degradation. Enhanced activities of laminarin- and xylan-hydrolyzing enzymes in aggregate-free seawater were due at least in part to cell-free enzymes. Measurements of enzyme lifetime using commercial enzymes suggest that hydrolytic lifetimes of cell-free enzymes may be sufficiently long to affect carbon remineralization in areas far from their site of production. Aggregate formation may be an important mechanism shaping the spectrum of enzymes active in the ocean, stimulating production of cell-free enzymes and leading to spatial and temporal decoupling of enzyme activity from the microorganisms that produced them...|$|R

At present the implementation of this technology has been deterred by high cost for enzymes. Enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulosic fibers shows a biphasic behavior with an initial fast step followed by a slow step leading to low cellulose conversion rates. Low hydrolytic conversion rates necessitate the use of a high enzyme dosage to obtain meaningful cellulose conversion rates which make the implementation of this entire technology economically infeasible. The objective {{of this study is to}} get a better understanding of the mechanism of enzymatic hydrolysis of fibers to glucose and to investigate the effect of cationic polymers on enzymatic <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>rates.</b> To achieve the first objective, we performed experiments so as to study changes in morphological and physiochemical properties like fiber length, percentage of fines, crystallinity index, kink angle, kink index, mean curl, total organic carbon and glucose production with time. We used bleached kraft softwood, hardwood, and unbleached softwood fiber as cellulosic substrate and pergalase as cellulase enzyme. All of the experiments were carried out at experimental conditions of a temperature of 50. C and a pH of 5. 0 which maximize enzymatic activity. We studied the impact of recycling and refining on <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>rates</b> by measuring total organic carbon and glucose production.

Overall, cationic polymers enhanced the production of glucose from cornstarch and different cellulosic feedstocks. The polymer can reduce the enzyme dosage depending on the conditions and feedstocks used. Ph. D...|$|R
40|$|Results of cholinesterase, dibucaine and {{fluoride}} numbers, and scoline <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>rates</b> {{are presented}} in a family found to have normal, silent and abnormal genes for plasma cholinesterase. Five sibs, confirmed by red cell grouping and tissue typing, {{have been shown to}} possess a cholinesterase pattern which cannot be explained on the basis of accepted theories of inheritance. In view of this it is suggested that, in this family, a mutation has occurred from a normal or silent gene to an abnormal gene...|$|R
40|$|Hydrated {{titanium}} dioxide (HTD) was precipitated by thermal hydrolysis in purified titanyl sulfate solution (TSS) obtained through the sodium hydroxide molten salt clean method. Various factors including the stirring speed and initial concentrations of TiOSO 4, sulfuric acid, and sodium ion were studied. The main influence {{factors in the}} hydrolysis process were the initial concentrations of TiOSO 4 and sulfuric acid. Contrary to the ferrous ion, the sodium ion improved the ionic activity of Ti 4 +, but did not decrease the crystal size. The Boltzman growth model (x=A(2) +(A(1) - A(2)) /{ 1 +exp[(t - t(0)) /dt) ]}, which focuses on two main parameters (C-TiOSO 4 and C-H 2 SO 4), fits the hydrolysis process well with R- 2 > 0. 97. An increase in sulfuric acid concentration negatively affected the <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>rates</b> {{and the value of}} A(2), while t(0) increased. An increase in titanyl sulfate concentration directly reduced the <b>hydrolysis</b> <b>rates</b> and particle size of HTD, contrary to the trend for the value of t(0). A simulation software called 1 stopt was used to observe the relationship between Z (A(1), A(2), t(0), dt) and a, b (C-TiO 2 and C-H 2 SO 4). (c) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
