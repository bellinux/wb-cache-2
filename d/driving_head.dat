Think on it when the stormy nights is so pitch dark,' said the Captain, solemnly holding up his hook, 'as you can't see your hand afore you, {{excepting}} when the wiwid lightning reweals the same; and when you drive, drive, drive through the storm and dark, as if you was a <b>driving,</b> <b>head</b> on, to the world without end, evermore, amen, and when found making a note of.

Lord help 'em, how I pitys all unhappy folks ashore now!"' Which quotation, as particularly applicable to the terrors of the ocean, the Captain delivered in a most impressive manner, concluding with a sonorous 'Stand by!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In my last voyage homeward-bound," [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "and that's the voyage off of which I now come straight, I {{encountered}} such weather off the Horn as {{is not very}} often met with, even there. I have rounded that stormy Cape pretty often, and I believe I first beat about there in the identical storms that blew the Devil's horns and tail off, {{and led to the}} horns being worked up into tooth-picks for the plantation overseers in my country, who may be seen (if you travel down South, or away West, fur enough) picking their teeth with 'em, while the whips, made of the tail, flog hard. In this last voyage, homeward-bound for Liverpool from South America, I say to you, my young friend, it blew. Whole measures! No half measures, nor making believe to blow; it blew! Now I warn't blown clean out of the water into the sky,--though I expected to be even that,--but I was blown clean out of my course; and when at last it fell calm, it fell dead calm, and a strong current set one way, day and night, night and day, and I drifted--drifted--drifted--out of all the ordinary tracks and courses of ships, and drifted yet, and yet drifted. It behooves a man who takes charge of fellow-critturs' lives, never to rest from making himself master of his calling. I never did rest, and consequently I knew pretty well ('specially looking over the side in the dead calm of that strong current) what dangers to expect, and what precautions to take against 'em. In short, we were <b>driving</b> <b>head</b> on to an island. There was no island in the chart, and, therefore, you may say it was ill-manners in the island to be there; I don't dispute its bad breeding, but there it was. Thanks be to Heaven, I was as ready for the island as the island was ready for me. I made it out myself from the masthead, and I got enough way upon her in good time to keep her off. I ordered a boat to be lowered and manned, and went in that boat myself to explore the island. There was a reef outside it, and, floating {{in a corner of the}} smooth water within the reef, was a heap of sea-weed, and entangled in that sea-weed was this bottle." ...|$|E

60|$|At this {{favourable}} {{moment of}} her voyage, I gave the alarm 'A man overboard!' (on the gravel), {{but he was}} immediately recovered, none the worse. Presently, I observed the Skipper overboard, but forbore to mention it, as he seemed in no wise disconcerted by the accident. Indeed, I soon came to regard the Skipper as an amphibious creature, for he was so perpetually plunging overboard {{to look up at}} the hands aloft, that he was oftener in the bosom of the ocean than on deck. His pride in his crew on those occasions was delightful, and the conventional unintelligibility of his orders in the ears of uncommercial landlubbers and loblolly boys, though they were always intelligible to the crew, was hardly less pleasant. But we couldn't expect to go on in this way for ever; dirty weather came on, and then worse weather, and when we least expected it we got into tremendous difficulties. Screw loose in the chart perhaps--something certainly wrong somewhere--but here we were with breakers ahead, my lads, <b>driving</b> <b>head</b> on, slap on a lee shore! The Skipper broached this terrific announcement in such great agitation, that the small fifer, not fifeing now, but standing looking on near the wheel with his fife under his arm, seemed for the moment quite unboyed, though he speedily recovered his presence of mind. In the trying circumstances that ensued, the Skipper and the crew proved worthy of one another. The Skipper got dreadfully hoarse, but otherwise was master of the situation. The man at the wheel did wonders; all hands (except the fifer) were turned up to wear ship; and I observed the fifer, when we were at our greatest extremity, to refer to some document in his waistcoat- pocket, which I conceived to be his will. I think she struck. I was not myself conscious of any collision, but I saw the Skipper so very often washed overboard and back again, that I could only impute it to the beating of the ship. I am not enough of a seaman to describe the manoeuvres by which we were saved, but they made the Skipper very hot (French polishing his mahogany face) and the crew very nimble, and succeeded to a marvel; for, within a few minutes of the first alarm, we had wore ship and got her off, and were all a-tauto--which I felt very grateful for: not that I knew what it was, but that I perceived that we had not been all a-tauto lately. Land now appeared on our weather-bow, and we shaped our course for it, having the wind abeam, and frequently changing the man at the helm, in order that every man might have his spell. We worked into harbour under prosperous circumstances, and furled our sails, and squared our yards, and made all ship-shape and handsome, and so our voyage ended. When I complimented the Skipper at parting on his exertions and those of his gallant crew, he informed me that the latter were provided for the worst, all hands being taught to swim and dive; and he added that the able seaman at the main-topmast truck especially, could dive as deep as he could go high.|$|E
50|$|Standard {{power unit}} was the Leyland 0.680 rated {{at up to}} 200 bhp with the Leyland 0.600 with outputs from 125-140 bhp as an option, these were mounted {{vertically}} and transversely at the rear. The front axle was a Worldmaster unit and the rear {{was similar to the}} Worldmaster unit but with the <b>driving</b> <b>head</b> inverted. Leyland Self-Changing Gears Pneumocyclic transmission was offered in 4 or 5-speed versions, with electric or pneumatic control. Drive was transmitted from engine to gearbox through either a centrifugal clutch or in later models via a fluid-friction coupling which enabled a solid connection at higher road speeds. An Eaton two speed <b>driving</b> <b>head</b> to the axle was optional. For the Australian market only a third tag axle, mounted ahead of the rear axle, was also offered. This was based on the Worldmaster rear axle but without a <b>driving</b> <b>head,</b> and was fitted into a suspension system based on that of the Albion Reiver 6x2 lorry. The purpose was to reduce axle loading. Most of the 6x2 Lions went to the Western Australian Government Railways and had passenger and cargo bodies fitted.|$|E

50|$|The absorbed ambient fluid {{mixes with}} {{the tail of}} the gravity current, which means that the head of the current leaves behind it a layer of less dense fluid. In effect this can be thought of like a rocket which leaves a streak of fumes behind it as it advances. In terms of structure, the tail {{consists}} of two counterflowing currents of fluid. At the bottom, dense fluid flows towards the head. It is this dense current which drives the current, providing new <b>driving</b> <b>head</b> to replace the head lost due to entrainment. Above this dense current is a counterflowing current of less dense fluid which is a result of dense fluid mixing with lighter ambient fluid at the head.|$|E
50|$|Flow {{through the}} main is by gravity under the <b>driving</b> <b>head</b> of the service {{reservoirs}} at the source WTWs. By virtue of its depth, the pipeline is under some pressure; however, the hydraulic grade line rarely exceeds ground level, and, to enter, supply water must be pumped up into the distribution zones at the pump-out shafts. In some respects, therefore, the main {{can be considered as}} a minor reservoir, from which supply is drawn as required. An indication of this dynamic variation in demand is that the minimum hydraulic level moves between the Battersea and Park Lane pump-out shafts. The loop is closed to provide the redundancy that allows any segment on the ring to be isolated and drained for maintenance without interrupting the supply to any shaft, not for hydraulic reasons.|$|E
50|$|Such viscometers can be {{classified}} as direct flow or reverse flow. Reverse flow viscometers have the reservoir above the markings and direct flow are those with the reservoir below the markings. Such classifications exist so that the level can be determined even when opaque or staining liquids are measured, otherwise the liquid will cover the markings and {{make it impossible to}} gauge the time the level passes the mark. This also allows the viscometer to have more than 1 set of marks to allow for an immediate timing of {{the time it takes to}} reach the 3rd mark, therefore yielding 2 timings and allowing for subsequent calculation of Determinability to ensure accurate results. The use of two timings in one viscometer in a single run is only possible if the sample being measured has Newtonian properties. Otherwise the change in <b>driving</b> <b>head</b> which in turn changes the shear rate will produce a different viscosity for the two bulbs.|$|E

50|$|Four {{variants}} {{were coded}} and three produced, {{all had a}} 18 ft wheelbase for a nominal bodied length of 30 ft, with width of 8 ft and a height of 13 ft unladen. LR1 had a fluid coupling behind the engine {{and in front of}} the step-down gearbox, which joined to a drive shaft under the entry step, whilst on the nearside, aft of the front-entrance position, a four-speed Pneumocyclic semi-automatic transmission was fitted with drive then continued alongside the nearside frame-member to the <b>driving</b> <b>head</b> of the axle. The LR3 had a single-plate clutch and a four-speed manual gearbox with synchromesh on third and top. Both of these had rear semi-elliptic leaf springs; whilst the LR7 was as the LR3, but with rear air suspension designed to provide a constant height (nearly two inches (5 cm) lower than the unladen height of the steel-sprung examples) regardless of loading, an equivalent model with semi-automatic transmission and air suspension was coded LR5 but none were ordered. Albion gave all its forward-control models odd model numbers: no one was proposing a bonnet-type double decker in the UK in 1961.|$|E

40|$|Comprehensive {{measurements}} are presented of the piezometric head in an unconfined aquifer during steady, simple harmonic oscillations {{driven by a}} hydrostatic clear water reservoir through a vertical interface. The results are analyzed and used to test existing hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic, small-amplitude theories along with capillary fringe effects. As expected, the amplitude of the water table wave decays exponentially. However, the decay rates and phase lags indicate the influence of both vertical flow and capillary effects. The capillary effects are reconciled with observations of water table oscillations in a sand column with the same sand. The effects of vertical flows and the corresponding nonhydrostatic pressure are reasonably well described by small-amplitude theory for water table waves in finite depth aquifers. That includes the oscillation amplitudes being greater at the bottom than {{at the top and}} the phase lead of the bottom compared with the top. The main problems with respect to interpreting the measurements through existing theory relate to the complicated boundary condition at the interface between the <b>driving</b> <b>head</b> reservoir and the aquifer. That is, the small-amplitude, finite depth expansion solution, which matches a hydrostatic boundary condition between the bottom and the mean <b>driving</b> <b>head</b> level, is unrealistic with respect to the pressure variation above this level. Hence it cannot describe the finer details of the multiple mode behavior close to the <b>driving</b> <b>head</b> boundary. The mean water table height initially increases with distance from the forcing boundary but then decreases again, and its asymptotic value is considerably smaller than that previously predicted for finite depth aquifers without capillary effects. Just as the mean water table over-height is smaller than predicted by capillarity-free shallow aquifer models, so is the amplitude of the second harmonic. In fact, there is no indication of extra second harmonics (in addition to that contained in the <b>driving</b> <b>head)</b> being generated at the interface or in the interior. No Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|An {{improved}} hierarchical {{fuzzy inference}} method based on C-measure map-matching {{algorithm is proposed}} in this paper, in which the C-measure represents the certainty or probability of the vehicle traveling on the actual road. A strategy is firstly introduced to use historical positioning information to employ curve-curve matching between vehicle trajectories and shapes of candidate roads. It improves matching performance by overcoming the disadvantage of traditional map-matching algorithm only considering current information. An average historical distance is used to measure similarity between vehicle trajectories and road shape. The input of system includes three variables: distance between position point and candidate roads, angle between <b>driving</b> <b>heading</b> and road direction, and average distance. As the number of fuzzy rules will increase exponentially when adding average distance as a variable, a hierarchical fuzzy inference system is then applied to reduce fuzzy rules and improve the calculation efficiency. Additionally, a learning process is updated to support the algorithm. Finally, a case study contains four different routes in Beijing city is used to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method...|$|R
