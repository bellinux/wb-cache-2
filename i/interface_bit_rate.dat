40|$|FPGAs have {{witnessed}} an {{increased use of}} dedicated communication interfaces. With their increased use, it is becoming critical to test and properly characterize all such <b>interfaces.</b> <b>Bit</b> error <b>rate</b> (BER) characteristic {{is one of the}} basic measures of the performance of any digital communication system. Traditionally, BER is evaluated using Monte-Carlo simulations, which are very time-consuming. Though there are some BER test products, none of them includes channel emulator. To overcome these problems, this thesis presents a scheme for BER testing in FPGAs, with a few orders of magnitude speedup compared to Monte-Carlo method. This scheme consists of two intellectual property (IP) cores: the BER tester (BERT) core and the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) generator core. Two challenging testing cases are successfully conducted using the testing scheme. We demonstrate through case studies that the proposed BER testing solution exhibits advantages in speed and cost compared with the existing solutions...|$|R

Our main {{goal is to}} develop a VBR video source-network interface with greater discrimination capability of bursty sources than the Leaky Bucket (LB) and which at the same time can exercise long term rate control. The real time policing mechanism utilized for our interface is based on comparing the worst case average/interval (WCA) between a constraint histogram and the content of a FIFO sliding window, monitoring the video source. Real video sequences and outputs from Markov based models arc used in our experiments. Wc show that our method can selectively accept a subset of those bursty sequences which would bc admitted by a LB of similar dimensions. This, in turn, will give the network greater control on the type of sequence to expect and result in a more informed decision in its call admission function...|$|R
40|$|The {{advances}} in communication technologies, especially the Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) technology, have ensured a steady {{increase in the}} total data-rate of a single fiber. Current WDM systems offer 32 - 64 wavelengths at 2. 5 - 10 Gb/sec/wavelength, hence approaching 1 Tb/sec capacity, while research-level systems already exceed multi-terabits in a single fiber. As a result, switches/routers are replacing the fiber link as the bottleneck of the network. Consequently, {{there is a high}} demand for terabits/s switches/routers that support a large number of ports running at high <b>bit</b> <b>rates.</b> Most of these high-performance and scalable switches/routers employ crossbars as the switching fabric. However, it is very challenging to implement a monolithic terabits/s CMOS crossbar switch chip. In particular, for a 256 * 256 crossbar switch, conventional approaches that use 8 bit-slices of switch core may not be feasible since the area is increased by a factor of 8. To address the problem, a novel 3 -stage pipelined MUX-tree based architecture is proposed in this thesis. The clock cycle is reduced to below 1 ns for a 0. 25 μm CMOS process implementation, so that only 2 bit-slices are needed for a 2 Gb/s <b>interface.</b> Higher <b>bit</b> <b>rates</b> can be achieved if the CMOS process is scaled to a smaller dimension. At the interface, asymmetric serial link architecture is adopted to decrease the complexity in the crossbar switch chip by removing the clock recovery circuits from the switch receiver end to the line card transmitter end. In this thesis, we enhance the architecture by eliminating the periodical calibration, and hence improving the performance without additional hardware cost. Using TSMC 0. 25 μm CMOS technology, the crossbar switch chip is laid out and simulated to demonstrate and verify the design. Both 1 ns clock cycle time in the crossbar switch core and 2 Gb/s serial link at the interface are successfully achieved. The layout size of 256 * 256 crossbar switch is 18 mm* 18 mm. It consumes 50 W power and provides a total bandwidth of above half terabits/s...|$|R

30|$|In those {{simulation}} results, FDASH requests many segments {{at a low}} <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> {{until the}} target buffer level is reached. After reaching the target buffer level, the <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> of the next segment gradually increases. In Fig.  6, the FDASH client requests the segment of 1500  kbps at 73  s for the first time, which is the 34 th request, while the proposed scheme requests a segment of 1500  kbps at 18  s for the first time, which is the 7 th request. In other words, the FDASH client has to wait 136  s (34 [*]×[*]D) to view the video at 1500  kbps. The SARA increases the client buffer level quickly by requesting many low <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> segments and requests a high <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> segment {{when there is a}} sufficient buffer level. However, because it requests an excessively high <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> segment, the download time for the segment is too long and the client buffer is quickly consumed.

The proposed scheme shows a similar number of changes as FDASH.

50|$|As {{is obvious}} by its {{definition}} <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> {{is a measure}} of the rate of information content of the digital video stream. In the case of uncompressed video, <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> corresponds directly to the quality of the video (remember that <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> is proportional to every property that affects the video quality). <b>Bit</b> <b>rate</b> is an important property when transmitting video because the transmission link must be capable of supporting that <b>bit</b> <b>rate.</b> <b>Bit</b> <b>rate</b> is also important when dealing with the storage of video because, as shown above, the video size is proportional to the <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> and the duration. <b>Bit</b> <b>rate</b> of uncompressed video is too high for most practical applications.
