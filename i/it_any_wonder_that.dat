40|$|The American {{secondary}} school system has structural prob-lems that are long-standing and pervasive. Too few students are engaged by their classes. Teachers can spend {{too little time}} on engrossing activities that lead to long-term learning, partly because they must {{spend too much time}} on classroom man-agement, student preparation for high-stakes tests, and ex-tracurricular responsibilities. The profession of teaching itself is held in low regard. Is <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>wonder,</b> then, <b>that</b> few college students aspire to the profession?

In the areas of science, technology, engineering, and math-ematics (STEM), the need for skilled teachers is even more pronounced than in general.

40|$|Excerpt} Michael Cohen, James March, and Johan Olsen 9 have {{developed}} an influential, agent-based representation of organizational decision-making processes. They submit that organizations are—at least in part {{and part of the}} time—distinguished by three general properties: (i) problematic preferences, (ii) unclear technology, and (iii) fluid participation. Citing, “Although organizations can often be viewed conveniently as vehicles for solving well-defined problems or structures within which conflict is resolved through bargaining, they also provide sets of procedures through which participants arrive at an interpretation of what they are doing and what they have done while {{in the process of doing}} it. From this point of view, an organization is a collection of choices looking for problems, issues and feelings looking for decision situations in which they might be aired, solutions looking for issues to which they might be the answer, and decision makers looking for work. ” Decision opportunities characterized by problematic preferences, unclear technology, and fluid participation, viz., ambiguous stimuli, generate three possible outcomes, each driven by the energy it requires within the confines of organizational structure. These outcomes, whose meaning changes over time, are resolution, oversight, and flight. Significantly, resolution of problems as a style for making decisions is not the most common; in its place, decision making by flight or oversight is the feature. Is <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>wonder</b> then <b>that</b> the relatively complicated intermeshing of elements does not enable organizations to resolve problems as often as their mandates demand...|$|R

40|$|It is {{no secret}} that comics’ formal {{structure}} resembles a pastiche: images, words and gaps of different styles and abstraction levels mix {{to tell a story}} that is more than their sum. Is <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>wonder,</b> then, <b>that</b> modern, myth-driven graphic novels tend to borrow their content elements – such as characters – from several heterogeneous sources as well? Wolfgang G. Müller's little-known but widely applicable theory of interfigurality (1991) shows how literary characters gain depth and resonance by sharing elements with characters in other works. The chapter revises his theory and shows how it could also be used in the analysis of comic book characters. Fantasy comics from Vertigo series like Fables and The Sandman to works like Hellboy or The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen draw their readerly and scholarly appeal from their eclectic, literary character galleries. Especially Mike Carey and Peter Gross’ The Unwritten (2009 –) realises every type of interfigurality Müller has identified in experimental literature, and even adds alternatives of its own. Close reading of this ongoing series underlines that interfigurality is a flexible, transmedial phenomenon: characters of words and images can parallel and reuse elements from purely textual characters in imaginative ways. This flexibility, however, renders Müller’s name-bound character concept insufficient. Since comparing characters to one another – especially intermedially – would not be possible without complex cognitive processes, Müller’s structuralistic view implies and should be supplemented with a cognitive basis. Thus, combined with the cognitive character theories developed by Baruch Hochman (1985) and Aleid Fokkema (1991), Müller’s notion of interfigurality becomes a viable analysing tool for narratives of all kinds. Since comics is a medium of gaps, fragments and “the invisible,” its heroes often read like puzzles, and some crucial pieces can occasionally be found through interfigural speculations...|$|R

40|$|Residential housing has been, {{and will}} always be, {{an issue that is}} at the {{forefront}} of community debate and discussion. Owning your own home is part of the great Australian Dream. For many it represents the opportunity to build a future, it represents connection with community and security for family. Buying into the Australian Dream doesn’t come cheap. According to a recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) report, the current ratio of housing prices in Australia to average incomes is 31. 6 % above the historical average. Is <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>wonder</b> then, <b>that</b> many Australians now worry that home ownership may be out of reach for them, for their children, or for their grandchildren? At the same time, Australians worry about rental and interest costs, and their impacts on the cost of living. There is no one simple explanation for the decline in housing affordability – although lack of land supply, underdevelopment, state planning laws and regulations, local council red tape, and stamp duty and tax arrangements likely all play a part. Over the years, however, many in the community have asked the question – what role does foreign investment play in residential real estate? It was timely then that, on 19 March 2014, the Treasurer, the Hon Joe Hockey MP commissioned the House Economics Committee to examine: 	 	the benefits of foreign investment in residential property; 	 	 	whether such foreign investment is directly increasing the supply of new housing and bringing benefits to the local building industry and its suppliers;  	 	 	how Australia’s foreign investment framework compares with international experience; and 	 	 	whether the administration of Australia’s foreign investment policy relating to residential property can be enhanced.   	 Current Foreign Investment Framework Under our current foreign investment framework, as it applies to residential real estate, foreign investment is channelled into new housing so that more homes, units and apartments are built – meaning more opportunity for people to purchase. It also contributes directly to economic activity – generating employment for builders and suppliers. When it comes to existing homes, there are generally prohibitions and restrictions. Non-resident foreign investors are prohibited from purchasing an existing home, and temporary residents (on visas of more than 12 months) can purchase just one existing home to live in while they are resident in Australia, but must sell this home on their visa expiring. All purchases, whether new or existing homes, are required to be pre-screened by the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB), supported by the Foreign Investment and Trade Policy Division of Treasury (FITPD). According to FIRB statistics, in the first 9 months of this financial year, FIRB approved foreign investment into residential property of around $ 24. 8 billion, 44 per cent higher than the $ 17. 2 billion approved during all of 2012 - 13. Much of this investment is concentrated in the Melbourne and Sydney markets. Most of the increase is attributable to proposed investment in new property, which at $ 19. 3 billion for the first 9 months of 2013 - 14 is 79 % higher than 2012 - 13. The total number of established property approvals for the first 9 months of 2013 - 14 is 5, 755 compared to 5, 101 for 2012 - 13.
