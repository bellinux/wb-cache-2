500|$|While they conceded the film's audacious {{production}} made {{it worth}} {{their time to}} watch, other critics found flaws. [...] "It's not a great film. The story has some good ideas, but the execution is uneven," [...] wrote Peter Sciretta at /Film, while still recommending it as [...] "unlike anything you've seen before [...] see again". Similarly, CraveOnline's William Bibbiani [...] "wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> <b>it</b> for the world" [...] but qualified it by noting that the film often lacked [...] "cohesion and clarity".|$|E
500|$|The {{party were}} further slowed {{down by the}} {{frostbite}} in Oates' left foot - daily marches were now down to less than five miles, which was insufficient {{given the lack of}} oil. Furthermore, by March 10 it became evident the dog teams were not coming: [...] "The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [...] had a bad trip home I suppose." [...] In a farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, dated March 16, Scott wondered whether he had overshot the meeting point and fought the growing suspicion that he had in fact been abandoned by the dog teams: [...] "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> <b>it,</b> but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support." [...] On the same day, Oates, who [...] "now with hands as well as feet pretty well useless", voluntarily left the tent and walked to his death. Scott wrote that Oates' last words were [...] "I am just going outside and may be some time".|$|E
500|$|Thirteen {{years after}} the trial, in a memoir {{entitled}} Master of the Girl Pat published by Doubleday, George Orsborne provided a new context for the Girl Pat voyage. According to this narrative, he had been recruited in 1935 to work for British Naval Intelligence. The Girl Pat venture was a secret assignment, connected with the imminent Spanish Civil War. Between the stops at Corcubión and Dakar, Orsborne claims, he carried out a mission {{to blow up a}} railway bridge in Spanish Morocco. The stops at Port Etienne, Dakar and elsewhere had been to receive further instructions from Naval Intelligence. In this later account Orsborne changes crew names and other details: Stone becomes [...] "Fletcher", and his leaving the voyage in Dakar is recorded by Orsborne as a [...] "desertion". Some of Orsborne's dates are inconsistent with the boat's known movements—he gives 26 June as the date of arrival in Dakar, and the account he gives of his Old Bailey trial bears no relation to the published record. Orsborne describes his stay in Wormwood Scrubs prison as [...] "a wonderful experience. I wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> <b>it</b> for anything".|$|E

500|$|The {{geographer}} E. G. R. Taylor, {{reviewing the}} book for the Royal Geographical Society in 1955, wrote that Hoskins {{made the case for}} getting a strong pair of boots to learn landscape history clearly enough. Taylor compared the book to Dudley Stamp's Man and the Land, published a few months earlier in 1955, saying that Hoskins seemed to <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> <b>it,</b> but that given the differences in their approaches, they could be read side by side. She noted also that Hoskins did not talk about London though he covered town landscapes, and appeared unaware of urban geography. Her review ended by remarking that Hoskins [...] "views the industrial revolution with mounting horror, and the industrialists themselves are bitterly chastised as 'completely and grotesquely insensitive. No scruples weakened their lust for money; they made their money and left their muck.'" [...] She noted however that Hoskins had happily moved to [...] "a quiet spot in Oxfordshire where he can forget the 'barbaric England of the scientists, the military men and the politicians' and look out of his study window on to the past", where, she wrote, he [...] "draws for us a last tender and evocative picture of the 'gentle unravished English landscape.'" [...] Dr. Hoskins, she wrote, forgetting all the horrors, [...] "reaches back through the centuries one by one and rediscovers Eden".|$|E
500|$|On {{the return}} {{journey from the}} Pole, Scott reached the 82.30°S meeting point for the dog teams, three days ahead of schedule, noting in his diary for 27 February 1912 [...] "We are {{naturally}} always discussing possibility of meeting dogs, where and when, etc. It is a critical position. We may find ourselves in safety at the next depot, {{but there is a}} horrid element of doubt." [...] By 10 March the temperature had dropped unexpectedly to below , and it became evident the dog teams were not coming: [...] "The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [...] had a bad trip home I suppose. It's a miserable jumble." [...] With 400miles (670km) still to travel across the Ross Ice Shelf, Scott's party's prospects steadily worsened as, with deteriorating weather, a puzzling lack of fuel in the depots, hunger and exhaustion, they struggled northward. In a farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, dated 16 March, Scott wondered whether he had overshot the meeting point and fought the growing suspicion that he had in fact been abandoned by the dog teams: [...] "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> <b>it,</b> but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support." [...] On the same day, Oates, whose toes had become frostbitten, voluntarily left the tent and walked to his death. Scott wrote that Oates' last words were [...] "I am just going outside and may be some time".|$|E
2500|$|Around 25 March, {{awaiting}} {{death in}} his tent at latitude 79.30°S, Scott speculated, in a farewell {{letter to his}} expedition treasurer Sir Edgar Speyer, that he had overshot the meeting point with the dog relief teams, writing [...] "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> <b>it,</b> but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark.

60|$|Barney's {{fall was}} {{not more than}} four or five feet. He found himself upon a {{slippery}} floor of masonry over which two or three inches of water ran sluggishly.

2500|$|Post-war, {{women were}} {{returned}} {{to many of the}} mundane jobs they occupied before the war started. Where once the army represented an escape from domestic life and liberty, it now returned to the male-dominated field it was before the war. Women who served in the batteries as gunners and searchlight-operators became secretaries and clerks. [...] "Demob (demobilisation) was a big disappointment to a lot of us. It was an awful and wonderful war. I wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> <b>it</b> for anything; some of the friends we made were forever” one female recounted after being dismissed from service to return to her normal job. Married women were released from service sooner {{at the end of the}} war, so they could return home before their husbands to ensure the home was ready when he returned from the front. Despite being largely unrecognised for their wartime efforts in the forces, the participation of women in World War II allowed for the founding of permanent women’s forces. Britain instituted these permanent forces in 1949, and the Women’s Voluntary Services are still a standing reserve force today.|$|E

5000|$|The group Sisters Uncut {{demonstrated}} at the London premiere against cuts {{to domestic}} violence services, which Helena Bonham-Carter described as [...] "perfect.

"You can use mine, Bab; you've {{got such}} a strong fist, I guess you could pull it," [...] added Ben, remembering {{that it would not}} be amiss to have a comrade who shot worse than he did, for he felt very {{inferior}} to Thorny in many ways, and, being used to praise, <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> <b>it</b> very much since he retired to private life.|$|R
50|$|Back at his hotel, {{he hears}} {{important}} news. There {{was a big}} fight the day before over the Yalu River, with eight MiGs shot down and three pilots lost, including Desmond.

6000|$|... "Don't yap, there!" [...] he said, low and hard. He {{thrust the}} gun close to Ruth. Then Duane {{knew for sure}} that he was no knight of the road, but a plain {{cutthroat}} robber.

60|$|Little {{did they}} imagine, while {{busy with the}} fire and kettle, how nearly they had gained their end, yet how disastrously they <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> <b>it.</b> Well for man, sometimes, that he is ignorant of what takes place around him.

60|$|Then, as {{he leaned}} against the stump, wet and shaking, {{familiar}} sound met his ears. It was made by the teeth of a grazing horse--a slight, keen, tearing cut. Wildfire was close at hand!

In the black gloom against the wall Slone could not distinguish Wildfire.|$|R
