40|$|A belt {{grinding}} machine is designed in particular {{for use in}} handling systems and has a continuous loop grinding belt {{like that of a}} {{belt grinding}} machine, said grinding belt being guided over two rollers spaced in relation to each other. The drive unit is integrated in one of these rollers, whereas the second roller can be provided with a side fixture to receive an additional machining tool. The two rollers are mounted in longitudinally movable bearings by means of an actuator acting on both sides. Said actuator is formed by clamping cylinders acting on both sides to which the rollers are attached via linear <b>guides</b> and <b>fork</b> elements. Flexible support elements secure the machining force independent of the movement and position of the handling system...|$|R

Oil pressure {{is provided by the}} trochoidal pump, driven by a steel spur gear off the crankshaft. The main bearings, crank pins, transmission main shaft, clutch bushing, shifter <b>fork</b> <b>guide</b> bar, and rocker arms are lubricated by pressurized oil, whereas the rest of the engine is lubricated by “oil splash.” ...|$|R

The binder's inventor Andreas Tengwall supposedly named it after a consortium consisting of himself and two companions, i.e. a trio.The binder can be opened at any place while holding the papers in place as the inner holes as <b>forked</b> <b>guide</b> pins from one side, the outer holes has pins from the other side.|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims {{to change}} the way Sandvik Coromant handles their chip managment system. The need arose when a larger project, {{involving}} the implementation of AGV (automatic <b>guided</b> vehicles) <b>fork</b> lifts to handle all the internal transports of goods. This forced Sandvik Coromant {{to change the}} current system of transporting metal chips. The work started with three days orientation in the factory. This was mainly {{to get a sense of}} how the chip managment system works today and what kind of solutions that could work given the circumstances. Idea generation resulted in a number of candidates, where only one was found to be realistically implementable, namely having the AGVs transport big bags placed on EUR pallets. Tests were conducted which showed that the big bags leak cutting fluid along the seams. Discussions have been established with suppliers regarding having specially made big bags which would be waterproof. If it is not possible to find waterproof big bags there are complimentary equipment that solves the problem discussed in Chapter 11 Recommendations...|$|R
60|$|There is an {{objection}} I may anticipate at this point. If I am {{to leave this}} statement unqualified, it would certainly be objected that such a need is no more nor less than the need of religion, that a properly formulated religion does supply a trustworthy <b>guide</b> at every <b>fork</b> and labyrinth in life. By my allusion {{to the failure of}} old formulae and methods to satisfy now, I am afraid many people will choose to understand that I refer to what is often spoken of as the conflict of religion and science, and that I intend to propound some contribution to the conflict. I will at any rate anticipate that objection here, in order to mark out my boundaries with greater precision.|$|R
5000|$|Alexander Lawton Mackall (Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, May 23, 1888 [...] - [...] West New Brighton, Staten Island, New York, 1968) was an author, {{journalist}} and gastronomy expert and critic. He was {{the editor of}} several New York City magazines {{and the author of}} the renowned restaurant <b>guide</b> Knife and <b>Fork</b> in New York (1948), a precursor of the Zagat's Survey. He had a strong connection to the Portuguese culture, being made an official of the Ordem de Cristo, a Portuguese honorific order that distinguishes personalities in the field of culture. Through The Lawton Mackall Foundation, incorporated in New York, he instituted a monetary prize to be awarded to the best students of a selected set of high schools in Portugal.|$|R
40|$|Naturally stalled {{replication}} forks {{are considered}} to cause structurally abnormal chromosomes in tumor cells. However, underlying mechanisms remain speculative, as capturing naturally stalled forks {{has been a}} challenge. Here, we captured naturally stalled forks in tumor cells and delineated molecular processes underlying the structural evolution of circular mini-chromosomes (double-minute chromosomes; DMs). Replication forks stalled on the DM by the co-directional collision with the transcription machinery for long non-coding RNA. RPA, BRCA 2, and DNA polymerase eta (Polη) were recruited to the stalled forks. The recruitment of Polη was critical for replication to continue, as Polη knockdown resulted in DM loss. Rescued stalled forks were error-prone and switched replication templates repeatedly to create complex fusions of multiple short genomic segments. In mice, such complex fusions circularized the genomic region surrounding MYC to create a DM during tumorigenesis. Our results define a molecular path that <b>guides</b> stalled replication <b>forks</b> to complex chromosomal rearrangements...|$|R
5000|$|Within {{two years}} of its opening, Alexander Mackalls {{restaurant}} <b>guide,</b> Knife and <b>Fork</b> in New York, described Quo Vadis as [...] "a delightful new restaurant unveiled {{by a couple of}} young paragons of politeness whose virtuosity as suggesters, carvers, servers and general pleasers is quite extraordinary." [...] In 1968, Craig Claiborne wrote in The New York Times {{that it was one of}} the finest kitchens in Manhattan and awarded it four stars. Quo Vadis had its own publicist, Lanfranco Rasponi, who was also the publicist for The Colony, and in its heyday was frequented by numerous celebrities and socialites including Diana Vreeland, Lee Radziwill, Paulette Goddard, Jacqueline Kennedy, Frank Sinatra, Truman Capote, and Andy Warhol. Bob Colacello recalled that many of the celebrity interviews for Warhols magazine Interview were taped at Quo Vadis because its vaulted ceiling and velvet-covered walls made for good acoustics. Amongst the interviews they recorded there were those with Truman Capote, Jack Nicholson, Burt Reynolds, and Mick Jagger. According to Colacello, Quo Vadis exempted Nicholson, Reynolds, and Jagger from its coat and tie requirement.|$|R
40|$|The {{world is}} {{becoming}} more and more globalized. The transportation and trading of goods across borders are becoming more frequent. All this is putting greater demands on companies dealing with material handling and distribution of supply. Material handling with forklifts is an area which is associated with risk of accidents.   Statistics from both the US and Europe shows that damages to material and personnel is frequent. A certain area that is in need of improvement is the handling of material on high storages. These storages can be as high as 15 m. When stacking and picking pallets at those heights it is very hard for the driver to get a good view of the pallet and handle the material in a safe way. There are several support systems available on the market today, to aid drivers with handling material on these heights. The question to be answered in this thesis is, how good are these systems and what systems should be recommended to users of forklifts? By the use of a literature study, where both available products on the forklift market as well as support systems from other markets were studied I got a good overview of available technologies. Using this information and methods for product design a number of technical concepts was generated. The concepts were limited to technologies that are available today. Because of that some technologies and concepts were overlooked. Most of the concepts consisted of a camera and a display used in different ways. A first evaluation of the concepts was made. Four concepts were chosen to be further evaluated. These four concepts were: Camera with guide lines Camera without <b>guide</b> lines <b>Fork</b> tip camera with guide lines No Camera. (benchmark) The concepts were then evaluated, tested and graded using the five criteria: Time (productivity), Safety, physical ergonomics, Usability and Preferred concept. The results showed that the concept consisting of the by TMHE used fork camera (2 above) combined with a new display and guide lines was the best support system. The result is fairly reliable because of the many different evaluation techniques used and the fact they all point the same concept. The validity however should be investigated further during a more extensive field test...|$|R
5000|$|ST-26 (ST {{stands for}} saperniy tank or [...] "{{engineer}} tank") — engineer tank; a bridge-laying tank {{based on the}} twin-turreted T-26 mod. 1931 chassis. According to the [...] "System of armoured engineering armament of the Red Army", the ST-26 was developed by designers from the Academy of Military Engineering (chief engineer of the project - Gutman) {{in the beginning of}} 1932. The ST-26 had only one shortened turret {{in the middle of the}} hull armed with a DT tank machine gun with 1,008 rounds; arc of fire was 211°. Special equipment consisted of a metal tracked bridge 7.35 m long and weighing 1100 kg, supports for the bridge (a front frame with two <b>forks</b> and two <b>guiding</b> rollers, lower <b>forks</b> with a hoisting mechanism and a roller, a rear frame with mounts and two rollers) and a cable winch (driven by the tank engine with the use of the reversing gear) inside the vehicle. The ST-26 was intended to provide for crossing of trenches and streams 6 - 6.5 m wide and barriers up to 2 m high by T-27, T-26 and BT light tanks: the bridge had a maximum load rating of 14 t. The bridge could be laid with the help of the cable winch in 25-40 seconds without crew exit; the raising operation took 2-3 min and a commander needed to come out from the vehicle in order to control the process. The ST-26 with its cable system for bridge laying was tested in the summer of 1932.|$|R
