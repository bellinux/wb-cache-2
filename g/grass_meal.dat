At the 40 % level, both materials impeded ovulation and produced temporary infertility in males and females. 20 % Capsella did not affect female fertility, and previous experiments had shown that an equivalent amount of <b>grass</b> <b>meal</b> was harmless. Neither substance affected the establishment of vaginal patency in immature female mice or produced signs of oestrogenization in spayed animals. The infertility produced was probably due to the high degree of dilution of the diet rather than to specific anti-fertility activity, but the latter possibility has not been excluded entirely. Zadina & Geisler [1950] reported that dried Capsella bursa pastoris suppressed the oestrous cycles of female mice when given as 40 % of the diet, but showed httle effect at a concentration of 20 %. The authors concluded that the plant material had a specific anti-gonadotrophic effect and discounted, theoretically, that the high dosage level employed might itself be a comphcating factor.

40|$|The {{fatty acid}} (FA) {{patterns}} of plasma/serum triglycerides (TG), phospholipids (PL) and cholesteryl esters (CE) of captive and free-ranging black rhinoceroses (Diceros bicornis) were investigated. Free-ranging animals (n = 28) stemmed from four different regions. Captive animals sampled included specimens from North American (n = 11) and three different European facilities (n = 6). The European animals were tested on 1 - 4 different diets, {{resulting in a}} total of 15 blood samples. Regardless of differences between the free-ranging animals from different regions, differences between captive and free-ranging animals were relatively uniform: captive animals had higher overall proportions of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), due to levels of linoleic acid (LA, 18 : 2 n 6) that were drastically increased as compared to free-ranging animals. In contrast, levels of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 18 : 3 n 3) were consistently lower on conventional zoo diets. n 6 /n 3 ratios for TG, PL and CE were 1. 6, 10 and 8 in samples from free-ranging animals, respectively, as compared to 4. 1 - 16. 3, 16 - 148 and 40 - 277 in samples from captive animals. There was a distinct correlation between the proportion of grain-based products (commercial concentrates, plain grains and bread) in the diets of the European animals and the measured levels of n 6 PUFA. An animal from a facility with a very low proportion of grain products in the diet nevertheless had high LA readings, most probably due to the use of sunflower oil as 2 % (dry matter basis) of its diet. One animal that received a high proportion of <b>grass</b> <b>meal</b> pellets due to an oral disease had increased ALA contents after the diet change. These results allow conclusions on the suitability of diets fed in captivity: the black rhinoceros is prone to several uncommon diseases that have been suspected to be linked to oxidative damage, possibly due to the disposition of this species to excessive iron storage. An unnatural dietary loading with PUFAs would exacerbate this problem. Additionally, n 6 FAs are known as precursors of pro-inflammatory mediators, and their overrepresentation could therefore exacerbate any inflammatory processes. Therefore, the current practice of using grain-based feeds as major ingredients in captive rhinoceros diets is discouraged. Diet items containing ALA (a precursor of anti-inflammatory mediators) such as, fresh grass, fresh browse, the respective silages should be included at higher levels in diets for captive black rhinoceroses. <b>Grass</b> <b>meal</b> pellets, although a good source of ALA and linked with high levels of ALA in an animal of this study, must be chosen with care for black rhinoceroses due to their particular proneness for high iron contents...|$|E

Broiler chicks (n= 147) were allocated into 49 pens and fed a mash broiler finisher diet (control) or the control diet diluted either with cassava leaf meal (CLM), gliricidia leaf meal (GLM), <b>grass</b> <b>meal</b> (GM), rice bran (RB), sand (SND), or sawdust (SD). For a given diluent, six diets were prepared by mixing the control diet with the respective diluents (w/w) at 0 % (fed from 27 - 28 d), 2 % (fed from 29 - 30 d), 4 % (fed from 31 - 32 d), 6 % (fed from 33 - 34 d), 8 % (fed from 35 - 36 d) and 10 % (fed from 37 - 40 d). SD, RB, GLM and GM significantly reduced the diluent-adjusted feed intake (total feed intake-diluent intake). Except for GLM and SD, other diluents resulted in similar weight gains as the control diet. The dietary dilution with rice bran reported the best feed conversion ratio (FCR) (1. 91). The total feed cost of the birds fed control and sand diluted diet was higher (p< 0. 001) than those fed other diets. Compared with the control diet, the gradual dilution of feed with RB and SND reduced the feed cost per kg of live weight gain by 12 and 10 Rs, respectively. Meat organoleptic properties of the birds fed RB diluted diet were similar to those of the control birds. It was concluded that gradual feed dilution with inert or less nutritive materials could be used as an alternative to conventional phase feeding.

Seven castrated Yorkshire pigs with an initial weight of 24. 8 kg (SD 3. 0) fitted with a post valve t-caecum (PVTC) cannula were used in a change-over experiment with four periods and four diets. The diets consisted of a basal part and a fibre part, including either a soluble ((Chicory (CH) and Sugar beet pulp (SBP)) or an insoluble ((Wheat bran (WB) and <b>Grass</b> <b>meal</b> (GM)) fibre source. Each experimental period was two weeks and consisted of one week for adaptation to each diet followed by one collection week. Fecal sampling occurred the four first days of each collection period and the ileal digesta samples were collected during fifth and seventh day of the second week. Overall, the effect of various diets on ileal and fecal pH were significant (P 0. 05). The effect of different type of dietary fiber on fecal and ileal dry matter (DM) was significant (P 0. 05). This study showed that pigs fed by CH, have more unique fecal microbial composition compared to the pigs fed with the other diets. TRF 160 and TRF 412 identified as Prevotella had higher relative abundance in pigs fed with the CH diet. TRF 275 identified as Megasphaera elsdenii had the highest relative abundance in pigs fed with WB diets.

40|$|SUMMARY 	Three {{trials were}} {{conducted}} to investigate the intake of oven-dried gliricidia by sheep, namely trial 1, addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG), trial 2, pretreatments, and trial 3 addition of additives. In the first trial, six rumen fistulated sheep were used to compare two dietary treatments in a change over design to study whether infusion of polyethelene glycol (PEG) into the rumen might increase intakes of gliricidia leaf as tannin in the leaf was believed to limit its intake. In the second trial, four sheep were used to compare four dietary treatments in a latin square design to study whether reheating or freezing the already oven-dried gliricidia leaf might increase its intake by the animals. On the other hand, the third trial was aimed to supplement the sheep with various supplements which {{are believed to be}} able to increase the taste of the leaf by the animals. These supplements were wheat millrun, molases, <b>grass</b> hay, cottonseed <b>meal,</b> palm kernel meal, or barley grain. For this reason, ten sheep were used to compare seven dietary treatments in a randomised complete block design. Differences between means were examined by analysis of variance using the General Linear Model procedure of the Statistical Analysis System. The results showed that neither administration of PEG into the rumen nor pretreatments (reheating or freezing) increased intake of gliricidia leaf by sheep. However, only mixing gliricidia with molasses increased the intake of the leaf by sheep over the control diet (gliricidia alone) over the six hours feeding period (43 vs 74 g DM) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{discrepancy}} in fatty acid (FA) status between a “natural” and a “civilized” environment, {{recognized as a}} major dietary phenomenon of clinical relevance in humans, was historically first described in the comparison of free-ranging and captive wild animals (CRAWFORD 1968). Compared to their free-ranging counterparts, captive specimens {{seemed to have a}} lower polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) status, and in particular a lower omega(n) 3 /n 6 PUFA ratio. However, a comprehensive evaluation of the available data on free-ranging and captive wild animals was missing so far. We collated data on the FA status of free-ranging and captive wild animals, comparing only data for the same body tissues and lipid fractions. In general, zoo-kept wild animals had a lower n 3 /n 6 PUFA status; in particular, birds and mammalian herbivore species for which data were available consistently showed lower proportions of n 3 PUFA and total PUFA in captivity. In zoo animals, this discrepancy has been repeatedly suspected to contribute to clinical problems, although conclusive studies are lacking. Should an adjustment of the FA status in captivity to the one in the wild be an objective in the dietary management of zoo animals, several strategies could be adopted: the feeding of horse or rabbit instead of ruminant meat; the use of food insects that are raised on green produce instead of grain products; the feeding of marine non-vertebrates such as shrimp or squid to animals specialized on these items but conventionally fed fish. In particular, a higher proportion of forage in general, the use of fresh or ensilaged forage instead of hay, a reduction of the use of grain-based concentrates, and an increased use of forage products (<b>grass</b> or lucerne <b>meal)</b> and linseed products in pelleted feeds, are measures that have been demonstrated in domestic herbivores to increase the n 3 /n 6 PUFA status...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the way which}} absorption of minerals relate to nutritional ecology and mineral conservation processes. A latin square designed experiment {{was used to assess}} the effects of diet on mineral (Ca, Mg, K, Na) absorption processes in reindeer (Rangifer tarandus L.). Three male calves were fed 3 different diets: concentrate with 25 % <b>grass</b> <b>meal</b> (RF- 71), lichens, and a mixed diet of lichens and RF- 71. Two other male calves were fed the lichen or mixed diet, supplemented with 4 g Ca/day. Ca supplementation significantly increased fecal Ca excretion, reduced the excretion of K and Mg, but had no significant effect on Na excretion. Rates of intake and fecal exretion of Ca, Mg and K were highly correlated (P&lt; 0. 001), while no correlations were found for Na. Negative digestibilities of Ca, Mg and K, and a positive Na digestibility were noted for the lichen diet. For the other diets, all minerals were in positive digestibility, and Ca supplements increased the digestibility of all minerals. Digesta from different sections of the alimentary tract were collected after termination of the experiment. Alimentary pools of Ca and K were equal for animals fed lichen or RF- 71, whereas the Na pool was largest on the lichen diet and the Mg pool largest on the RF- 71 diet. Rumen turnover time (rumen mineral pool size/daily mineral intake) was consistently less than 3 days for Ca and Mg, but was 22 and 82 days for Na on the RF- 71 and lichen diets respectively. Estimates of mineral exchange {{in various parts of the}} tract showed that the intestines play and important role in scavanging endogenously secreted minerals. Results are discussed with respect to mineral binding by lichens and the possible role of natural mineral supplements in the nutritional ecology of reindeer...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{increase}} our understanding about chicory (forage and root) as fibre source for pigs, by studying the effects of diets with inclusion of chicory on digestibility, digestion site, performance, gut microbiota and environment. In total 62 pigs were used, including newly weaned and growing intact pigs and growing post valve t-caecum (PVTC) -cannulated pigs. The weaned pigs were fed cereal-based diets with inclusion of 40, 80 and 160 g/kg of either chicory or ribwort forage. The growing pigs were fed cereal-based diets with inclusion of 80 and 160 g/kg of chicory forage and/or root. The cannulated pigs were fed diets with similar non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) content, comprising of a basal diet and four diets with one of four fibre sources, two pectin-rich (chicory forage and sugar beet pulp), and two arabinoxylan-rich (wheat bran and <b>grass</b> <b>meal).</b> The {{results showed that the}} total tract digestibility of organic matter (OM) and energy of chicory forage was similar to commonly used forage crops. The total tract digestibility of NSP in both chicory forage and root was higher than the NSP digestibility in cereals. Inclusion of 80 g chicory forage/kg did not reduce the digestibility of OM, crude protein and energy. Inclusion of 160 g chicory forage/kg did not reduce growth performance and did not increase gastrointestinal organ weights. Chicory forage and root affected the gut microbiota differently with higher lactobacilli:coliform ratio when combined in the diet which indicates a synergistic effect. Chicory forage increased the abundance of Bacteroides-Prevotella-Porphyromonas in faeces. Increased total amount of fermentable dietary fibre in the diet increased the abundance of the same groups in ileal digesta. The effects of different fibre sources on the microbiota were to a high degree ingredient-specific. The effect on organic acids was NSP-structure specific with increased butyric acid concentration on arabinoxylan-rich diets. The effect of pectin-rich diets was dependent on the intra-molecular structure of pectin, with highest proportion of acetic acid on chicory forage diet. In conclusion, these studies shows that there is potential for both chicory forage and root to be used as regular feed ingredients in pig diets...|$|E

Researches were {{conducted}} in the Animal Husbandry Department of the Veterinary Academy of Lithuanian Health Sciences University, also in the vivarium of Lithuanian Veterinary Academy and in the Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research of the Polish Academy of Sciences. New Zealand rabbits {{were used for the}} researches. All rabbits were calved over one cycle of reproduction (50 percent were male and 50 percent were female). All rabbits were assigned to four groups of five individuals each. The rabbits of the control group (K) were fed a standard diet; the group KP was fed a standard diet with increased fat volume. The rabbits of the group E were subjected to a standard diet with the addition of blackcurrant polyphenolic extract (1, 5 percent), the animals of the group EP were fed a standard diet with increased fat volume + blackcurrant extract (1, 5 percent). Duration of the research was 45 days. Rabbits were stored in the individual flat-bottomed wire cages in closed room. Over the research all rabbits were fed and watered ad libitum. The research included observation of rabbit growth dynamics, level of ammonia in the substance of cecum, activity of microbe ferments, short-chain fatty acids, and research of overall wellness. Thegoalofthepaper: to investigate the effect of blackcurrant (Ribes nigrum L.) products distinguishing for antioxidant features on digestive processes and productivity of rabbits. The goal of the paper has been achieved by solving the following tasks: • Generation of high digestible energy obtained from high-fat feeding regimens by replacing <b>grass</b> <b>meal</b> with blackcurrant pomace; • Establish the interaction of the weight and overweight of the rabbits, feed consumption with blackcurrant; • Investigate the effect of blackcurrant pomace on pH and dry matter of the content of separate segments of the gastrointestinal tract; • Establish the effect of blackcurrant pomace on the viscosity of the content of the ileum and on the concentration of ammonia in the content of the caecum; • Investigate the concentration and composition of CSFA in the caecum; • Establish the effect of blackcurrant pomace on the activities of the proteins, bacterial enzymes (α- and β-galactosidase, glucosidase, α- and β-glucosidase and β-glucuronidase) in the caecal and colonic contents and on the volumes of volatile fatty acids (VFA); • Establish the effect on the indicators of the antioxidant status of the rabbits; • Establish the effect on biochemical parameters of the blood; • Investigate the indicators of atherogenicity and insulin resistance of the rabbits. Results of the research. Consumption of blackcurrant pomace by replacing <b>grass</b> <b>meal</b> has confirmed the hypothesis that it can be considered as an effective and affordable ingredient of feeding regimens for rabbits. Supplementing the feeding regimen with blackcurrant pomace has reliably decreased the total concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) within the digestive content of the caecum of the rabbits, and it has been established the reduced concentration of acetic acid. The used blackcurrant pomace has not any effect on the concentrations of propionic, isobutyric, isovaleric and valeric acids (p < 0, 05). Feeding the rabbits with a high-fat diet with the addition of blackcurrant pomace extract rich in polyphenolic compounds positively modifies lipids in blood serum and body antioxidant activity, and the measurements of the function of the large intestine. It is observed the tendency for ensuring the stability of the parameter of the insulin physiologic norm. Consumption of relatively high amounts of the product obtained during the process of blackcurrant reprocessing (pomace) can also have a positive therapeutic effect for treatment of disorders of the functions related to obesity and their complications. The regiment with blackcurrant pomace has not had any effect on the rapidity of rabbits’ growth and consumption of feed; however, it has reliably reduced the activity of β-glucoronidase in the caecum. Irresective of the feeding regiment type used for the experimental groups, blackcurrant pomace has reduced the activities of α-glucosidase, β-glucosidase, α-galactosidase. The results of the research show the benefit of blackcurrant pomace the physiological outcomes of rabbits’ digestive system due to the interaction between contained fibre and polyphenolic compounds...|$|E
40|$|The (water) -soluble {{fraction}} of feeds is often {{assumed to be}} completely and immediately degraded in the rumen. The objective {{of this study was}} to separate the washout fraction (fraction A) obtained usually by difference after submitting the nylon bags to the machine-washing program, to investigate the nature and the degradation of the soluble crude protein in the washout fraction. The washout fraction obtained in vitro (filtrate) of 10 feeds was collected in water using nylon mesh as a filter. The feeds used in the study were: two <b>grass</b> silages, soybean <b>meal,</b> three corn gluten feeds, lupine meal, rapeseed meal, wet brewers grain silage and corn gluten feed silage. Average N losses during filtration and from machine-washed nylon bags ranged from 15 % (rape seed meal) to 74 % (grass silage) and were not different between procedures. N recovered in the filtrate ranged from 12 % (soybean meal) to 60 % (corn gluten feed silage) of sample N. The three fractions obtained from the filtrate were: soluble protein (TP), non-protein N (NPN) and fine particles (NS). The NS fraction was obtained after centrifugation of the filtrate and comprised 0 % to 87 % of N in the filtrate. Soluble protein (TP) in the supernatant was obtained after precipitation with trichloroacetic acid and N in the remaining supernatant was defined as non-protein N (NPN). Significant amounts of TP were found in soybean meal (58 %), lupine meal (30 %) and rapeseed meal (27 %) as percent of total N in the filtrate. NPN ranged from 13 % to 100 % of N in the filtrate. The in vitro incubation of the protein N (NS + TP) showed that all fractions were not completely degraded, suggesting a potential participation as escape protein. Fine particles in the filtrate have similar degradation rates as the residue left in the filter. It is concluded that the washout fraction consisted of different crude protein fractions that were not always completely and immediately degraded in the rumen...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{composition}} of feedstuffs commonly included in dairy cow rations is variable within a feed type, which raises {{a potential for}} nutrient inadequacies for an animal. There are multiple methods to characterize and determine chemical composition including in vitro and in situ methods, as well as refining processing procedures to produce a consistent feed product. Feed component digestibilities can also be evaluated using similar methods. Research reported in Chapter 2 focuses on characterizing chemical composition and determining the digestibility of fiber and protein fractions of corn dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) originating from seven different production sites across Michigan, South Dakota, and Nebraska. Results indicate that chemical {{composition of}} DDGS, including amino acid composition and fatty acid composition, differed significantly among sources suggesting that processing procedures are variable and frequent analysis of chemical composition should be conducted to ensure quality control. Protein digestibility was determined using the Ross et al. (2013) method, with significant differences being reported among DDGS samples {{in the areas of}} rumen-undegradable protein (RUP), RUP digestibility, and total-tract digestible protein on both a crude protein and dry matter basis. Fiber digestibility was determined through a series of varying in vitro incubation periods, as well as using the Combs (2013) method of in vitro total-tract neutral detergent fiber digestibility. Significant differences were observed across all DDGS samples for protein and fiber digestibility estimates across production sites. Chapter 3 describes the second experiment, focusing on quantifying the extent of microbial contamination of eleven different feedstuffs with varying chemical compositions. Feeds used in this study included alfalfa hay, bloodmeal, wet brewers grain, canola meal, citrus pulp, corn silage, corn dried distillers grains with solubles, <b>grass</b> hay, soybean <b>meal,</b> soy hulls, and SoyPass®. Samples were weighed into nylon bags and ruminally incubated for 16 hours to determine DM digestibility (DMD) and the RUP fraction. After ruminal incubation, samples were lightly rinsed, DNA was extracted, and concentrations of DNA were obtained using spectrophotometry. DNA samples were then run through a droplet digitial polymerase chain reaction procedure in order to quantify the extent of microbial contamination on each feed sample. As expected, chemical composition and DMD differed across feedstuffs. Microbial contamination upwardly biased RUP estimates and the extent of this contamination differed across feedstuffs, suggesting there may be an opportunity to increase our understanding of chemical composition of dietary components and the effect they have on the extent of microbial contamination.

40|$|O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar o efeito dos diferentes níveis de concentrado nas dietas sobre a composição física da carcaça. Trinta e dois bezerros da raça Holandesa, PC, variedade preto e branco, divididos em dois grupos de abate (grupo 1 : 16 animais abatidos com 190 ± 10 kg PV e grupo 2 : 16 animais abatidos com 300 ± 10 kg, com, em média, 75 dias de idade e 78 kg PV inicial, foram distribuídos em delineamento inteiramente casualizado, com quatro tratamentos e quatro repetições para ambos os grupos. Os animais foram alimentados à vontade com dietas contendo 45, 0; 60, 0; 75, 0; e 90, 0 % de concentrado na base da ração (% MS), usando-se feno de capim coast-cross (Cynodon dactylon), fubá de milho e farelo de soja, os quais constituíram dietas com aproximadamente 16 % PB. A cada período de 28 dias, os animais foram pesados e abatidos quando se aproximavam do peso de abate preestabelecido para os grupos 1 e 2. A proporção de ossos na carcaça dos animais do grupo 1 não foi influenciada, porém a de músculos diminuiu e a de gordura e as relações tecido adiposo:ósseo e tecido adiposo:muscular aumentaram linearmente, em função dos níveis de concentrado nas rações. O aumento do nível de concentrado nas rações influenciou somente a relação tecido muscular:ósseo na carcaça dos animais do grupo 2. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of different dietary levels of concentrate on the carcass physical composition. Thirty two pure Holstein black and white type bull calves, into two slaughter groups (group 1 : 16 animals slaughtered with 190 ± 10 kg PV and group 2 : 16 animals slaughtered with 300 ± 10 kg) with average of 75 days of age and initial 75 kg LW were allotted to a completely randomized design, with four treatments and four replicates for both groups. The animals were full fed diets containing 45. 0, 60. 0, 75. 0, and 90. 0 % concentrate in the diet (% DM), using coast-cross (Cynodon dactylon) <b>grass</b> hay, corn <b>meal</b> and soybean meal, which constituted diets with approximately 16 % CP. At each 28 days period, the animals from each group were weighed and slaughtered at preestablished weights for the groups 1 and 2. The increase of the concentrate levels in the diets only affected proportion of bone in the carcass of the animals of group 1, were not affected, however that of muscle decreased and that of fat, adipose tissue:bone ratio and adipose tissue:muscle ratio linearly increased with the concentrate levels in the diets. The increase of dietary concentrate levels only influenced the muscle:bone ratio in the carcass of the animals of the group 2...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the health {{characteristics}} of buffalo milk and Mozzarella, the effect of two concentrates differing in linoleic acid (LA) content on milk fatty acid (FA) composition was con- sidered. Dietary LA supplementation, in fact, is the most effec- tive strategy to increase milk content of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which has potentially positive effects on human health. Thirty-two buffaloes were randomly allotted in two groups: exper- imental (EG) and control (CG). During the first period (P 1, from 26 to 82 days in milk) EG fed a total mixed ratio (TMR) composed by barley silage, alfalfa and <b>grass</b> hay, maize <b>meal</b> and 3 kg of a concentrate composed by 30 % cracked whole soybean (WS) and 70 % horse bean (HB), which provided 12. 6 g/kg DM of LA. During the second period, (P 2, from 97 to 152 days in milk), the experi- mental concentrate was 70 / 30 WS/HB that provided 25. 4 g/kg DM of LA. During both periods CG fed a diet {{based on the same}} for- age than EG and a concentrate composed by maize meal, soybean meal, and cotton seeds (7. 2 g/kg DM of LA). Individual milk sam- ples were weekly collected and data of milk FA composition were analysed by a repeated measures model. At the end of each peri- od, milk from each group was separately processed and six Mozzarella cheese for group were sampled. During P 1, LA con- tent of milk from EG was significantly higher than milk from CG (1. 85 vs. 1. 52 % of TL), whereas CLA and vaccenic acid (VA) con- tent did not differ between groups. During P 2, the LA content in EG milk was more than two times higher than that in CG milk (3. 91 vs. 1. 59 % of TL). Also CLA (0. 59 % of TL vs. 0. 38 % of TL for EG and GC respectively) and VA (1. 67 %of TL vs. 1. 25 % of TL for EG and CG, respectively) milk content significantly differed between groups. Oleic acid (OA) content significantly differed between treatments, being higher in milk from EG (+ 17 %). Interestingly, differences were observed also in the substrate/product ratio related to stearoil-CoA desaturase enzyme (SCD). This enzyme acts either on C 18 : 0, that is con- verted in OA, and on C 14 : 0, C 16 : 0 and VA, which are converted in cis 9 unsaturated FA. Results suggested a higher affinity of SCD for C 18 : 0. The desaturation index of C 18 : 0, in fact, was more than ten times higher than that of other substrates. The FA com- position of mozzarella reflected that observed in milk, confirm- ing that cheesemaking did not affect the transfer of FA from milk to cheese...|$|R
