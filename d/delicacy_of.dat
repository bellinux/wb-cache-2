5|$|I am vexed and {{surprised}} at your not thinking {{the situation of}} Maria sufficiently important, and can only account for this want of – shall I say it? <b>delicacy</b> <b>of</b> feeling, by recollecting {{that you are a}} man – For my part I cannot suppose any situation more distressing than for a woman of sensibility with an improving mind to be bound, to such a man as I have described, for life – obliged to renounce all the humanizing affections, and to avoid cultivating her taste lest her perception of grace, and refinement of sentiment should sharpen to agony the pangs of disappointment.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{form part}} of the human diet in some cultures, and in Thailand, crickets are farmed for this purpose in the north of the country and palm weevil larvae in the south. The crickets are kept in pens, boxes or drawers and fed on {{commercial}} pelleted poultry food, while the palm weevil larvae live on cabbage palm and sago palm trees, which limits their production to areas where these trees grow. Another <b>delicacy</b> <b>of</b> this region is the bamboo caterpillar, and the best rearing and harvesting techniques in semi-natural habitats are being studied.|$|E
5|$|The choir, of five bays, {{was built}} between 1283 and 1315 {{to the design}} of Richard Lenginour, and is an early example of Decorated Gothic architecture. The piers have {{strongly}} modelled attached shafts, supporting deeply moulded arches. There is a triforium gallery with four cusped arches to each bay. The sexpartite vault, which is a 19th-century restoration, is supported by clusters of three shafts which spring from energetic figurative corbels. The overall effect is robust, and contrasts with the <b>delicacy</b> <b>of</b> the pinnacled choir stalls, the tracery of the windows and the rich decoration of the vault which was carried out by the ecclesiastical designers, Clayton and Bell. The choir stalls, dating from about 1380, are one of the glories of the cathedral.|$|E
60|$|It {{appeared}} {{it was not}} {{the same}} thing. There were subtle <b>delicacies</b> <b>of</b> diction bound to escape even the best translator. These subtle <b>delicacies</b> <b>of</b> diction I could enjoy only by devoting the next seven or eight years of my life to the study of Greek and Latin. It will grieve the University professor to hear it, but the enjoyment <b>of</b> those subtle <b>delicacies</b> <b>of</b> diction did not appear to me--I was only fourteen at the time, please remember--to be worth the time and trouble.|$|R

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{remarkable}} large-scale example of Rococo church building was the Frauenkirche at Dresden, recently rebuilt after its almost total destruction in World War II. The entire structures embodies a dynamic, surging motion which combines with a <b>delicacy</b> <b>of</b> architectural detail that {{is typical of the}} Rococo style. This church is dominated by its bell-shaped cupola which imitates in form those to be found on countless church towers in the region, but recreated here not in wood sheathed with metal, but as a mighty masonry dome.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{his pride}} in touring with Ellington (one of two letters to Grappelli relates his excitement), {{he was not}} fully {{integrated}} into the band. He played a few tunes {{at the end of}} the show, backed by Ellington, with no special arrangements written for him. After the tour, Reinhardt secured an engagement at Café Society Uptown, where he played four solos a day, backed by the resident band. These performances drew large audiences. Having failed to bring his usual Selmer Modèle Jazz, he played on a borrowed electric guitar, which he felt hampered the <b>delicacy</b> <b>of</b> his style. He had been promised jobs in California, but they failed to develop. Tired of waiting, Reinhardt returned to France in February 1947.|$|E

25|$|Closely {{related to}} the flower still life is the flower garland genre of {{painting}} that was invented by Jan Brueghel in collaboration with cardinal Federico Borromeo in Milan. The early versions of these paintings, such as the collaboration by Breughel and Rubens in Munich (Alte Pinakothek, Munich) show the Virgin Mary and Christ child surrounded by a garland of flowers. They have been interpreted as distinctly Counter Reformation images, with the flowers emphasizing the <b>delicacy</b> <b>of</b> the Virgin and Child–images of which were destroyed in large numbers during the iconoclastic outbreaks of 1566. Brueghel's student, the Jesuit painter Daniel Seghers, also painted many {{of these types of}} works for an international clientele. In later versions, the fleshy Madonna and Child gave way to sculptural niches and even pagan themes.|$|E
25|$|I propose in this {{narrative}} {{that it is}} sometimes extremely difficult and even impossible to determine sex during life. In one of the anatomical theaters of the hospital..., there arrived {{toward the end of}} January a cadaver which in life was the body of a certain Joseph Marzo... The general physiognomy was decidedly male in all respects. There were no feminine curves to the body. There was a heavy beard. There was some <b>delicacy</b> <b>of</b> structure with muscles that were not very well developed... The distribution of pubic hair was typical of the male. Perhaps the lower extremities were somewhat delicate, resembling the female, and were covered with hair... The penis was curved posteriorly and measured 6 cm, or with stretching, 10 cm. The corona was 3 cm long and 8 cm in circumference. There was an ample prepuce. There was a first grade hypospadias... There were two folds of skin coming {{from the top of the}} penis and encircling it on either side. These were somewhat loose and resembled labia majora.|$|E
500|$|The {{privet hawkmoth}} {{caterpillar}} {{is used as}} an example of [...] "general resemblance". Dimorphism, where caterpillars of a species are sometimes green, sometimes brown, is discussed. The <b>delicacy</b> <b>of</b> larvae is given as a reason for their [...] "wonderful concealment": one touch from a predator [...] "being practically fatal". The resemblance of Kallima and some moths to dead leaves is examined.|$|E

500|$|The medium-weight coins often carry {{designs of}} high artistic quality, {{exceeding}} {{that of the}} contemporary Frankish currency. Coin portraits of Offa {{have been described as}} [...] "showing a <b>delicacy</b> <b>of</b> execution which is unique in the whole history of the Anglo-Saxon coinage". The depictions of Offa on the coins include a [...] "striking and elegant" [...] portrait showing him with his hair in voluminous curls, and another where he wears a fringe and tight curls. Some coins show him wearing a necklace with a pendant. The variety of these depictions implies that Offa's die-cutters were able to draw on varied artistic sources for their inspiration.|$|E
500|$|You {{know that}} as a female I am {{particularly}} attached to her—I feel more than a mother's fondness and anxiety, when I reflect on the dependent and oppressed state of her sex. I dread lest she {{should be forced to}} sacrifice her heart to her principles, or principles to her heart. With trembling hand I shall cultivate sensibility, and cherish <b>delicacy</b> <b>of</b> sentiment, lest, whilst I lend fresh blushes to the rose, I sharpen the thorns that will wound the breast I would fain guard—I dread to unfold her mind, lest it should render her unfit for the world she is to inhabit—Hapless woman! what a fate is thine! ...|$|E
