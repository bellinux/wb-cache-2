Both of his parents were descended from Three Bars, who was the sire of Lena's Bar and the <b>grandsire</b> of Jet Deck's dam.

Easy Date was later named 1975 World Champion Quarter Running Horse. He also sired Pie In the Sky, the 1979 All American Futurity winner, and Mr Trucka Jet, the 1985 All American Futurity winner.
