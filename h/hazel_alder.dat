50|$|In the 16th century, tenants of {{the village}} shared common land known as Billington Common with tenants of local villages Great Harwood and Wilpshire. There also existed a wood of {{approximately}} 60 acres named Elker, which contained oak trees, as well as <b>hazel</b> and <b>alder.</b> Oak and ash trees could {{also be found in}} the smaller Nab wood, which was around 40 acres.|$|R
50|$|In {{northeast}} Europe, the Early Atlantic {{forest was}} but slightly {{affected by the}} rise in temperature. The forest had been pine with an underbrush of <b>hazel,</b> <b>alder,</b> birch, and willow. Only about 7% of the forest became broad-leaved deciduous, dropping to Boreal levels in the cooling of the Middle Atlantic. In the warmer Late Atlantic, the broad-leaved trees became 34% of the forest.|$|E
50|$|The {{scientific}} name of Smooth Alder is Alnus serrulata (Aiton) Willd., synonymous with Alnus noveboracensis Britton, Alnus rubra Desfontaines ex Spach, Alnus rugosa (Du Roi) Sprengel, Alnus rugosa (Du Roi) Sprengel var. serrulata (W. Aiton) H. Winkler, Alnus serrulata (W. Aiton) Willdenow var. subelliptica Fernald, and Betula serrulata W. Aiton. It has English common names including common alder, tag alder, <b>hazel</b> <b>alder,</b> and smooth alder.|$|E
5000|$|Trees {{and other}} flora include ridge trees of longleaf, loblolly, and shortleaf pine along with sand jack oak, {{also known as}} Bluejack Oak, Cinnamon Oak, or Upland Willow Oak in the other ten {{indigenous}} states where it is found.

5000|$|Lathraea squamaria, {{the common}} toothwort, is {{a species of}} toothwort.It is {{parasitic}} on the roots of <b>hazel</b> and <b>alder,</b> occasionally on beech, in shady places such as hedge sides. It consists of a branched whitish underground stem closely covered with thick, fleshy, colourless leaves, which are bent over so as to hide under the surface; irregular cavities communicating with the exterior are formed in {{the thickness of the}} leaf.|$|R
50|$|This shrub {{grows in}} cracks in rocks {{alongside}} flowing water. It has a fibrous mass of roots and lateral rhizomes that anchor it, {{and even if}} most of the plant is ripped away during flooding, it easily resprouts from remnants of the rhizomes. It is often found growing in sandstone bedrock, gravel bars, nooks between boulders, and in riverborne deposits of debris, rubble, and silt. It is adapted to periodic flooding, scouring, erosion, and deposition of litter. Other plants in the habitat may include <b>hazel</b> <b>alder</b> (Alnus serrulata), silky dogwood (Cornus amomum), jewelweed (Impatiens capensis), creepers (Parthenocissus), ninebark (Physocarpus opulifolius), sycamore species (Platanus), blackberries (Rubus), willow species (Salix), American elderberry (Sambucus canadensis), soapworts (Saponaria), greenbrier species (Smilax), goldenrod species (Solidago), and poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans).|$|E
5000|$|... ==Flora and fauna== The {{biodiversity}} of {{the plants}} {{is due to the}} wide range of altitude zones and the complexity of the terrain. In the nival zone, above 3,600 meters, there is no vegetation at all. In the sub-nival zone from 3,000 to 3,500 the sparse and non-continuous vegetation is that of tundra: lichens, creeping willow, saxifrage. From 2,300 meters to 3,000 meters is low-grass alpine meadows (up to 30 cm in height). The sub-alpine zone, 1,400 to 2,600 meters, is alpine meadows of <b>hazel,</b> <b>alder,</b> and rhododendron. From 1,000 to 2,400 meters is a forest belt of broad leaf trees to 1,600 meters and conifers above. Below 1,000 meters is pine, birch and oak forest. The representative mammal is the endangered West Caucasian tur. It is found in two separate sub-species in the Chegem and Bezengi gorges, representing the Western Caucasus and Dagestan. Brown bears are very common. Other common animals are fox, jackal, wild cat, martens, ermine, weasels, Altai squirrel, hare, and several species of rodents, shrews, and bats. The only fish found in the streams are brook trout.|$|E

While today a generally flat and open landscape, in the Iron Age it was covered by bog, quicksand, and ponds, surround by dense woodlands of birch, willow, <b>hazel</b> and <b>alder</b> while higher ground was covered by oak and ash. The terrain was dangerous and impassible for much of the year.|$|R
60|$|That {{ride was}} the sternest we had yet experienced. It was like {{swimming}} {{in a sea of}} green water. The branches sloshed us with blinding raindrops. The mud spurted under our horses' hoofs, the sky was gray and drizzled moisture, and as we rose we plunged into ever deepening forests. We left behind us all <b>hazel</b> bushes, <b>alders,</b> wild roses, and grasses. Moss was on every leaf and stump: the forest became savage, sinister and silent, not a living thing but ourselves moved or uttered voice.|$|R
40|$|Background: Alongside <b>hazel,</b> <b>alder</b> and birch pollen allergies, ash pollen allergy is a {{relevant}} cause of hay fever during {{spring in the}} European region. For some considerable time, ash pollen allergy was not routine-ly investigated and its clinical relevance {{may well have been}} underestimated, particularly since ash and birch tree pollination times are largely the same. Ash pol-len extracts are not yet well standardized and dia-gnosis is therefore sometimes unreliable. Olive pol-len, on the other hand, is strongly cross- reactive with ash pollen and is apparently better standardized. erefore, the main allergen of olive pollen, Ole e 1, has been postulated as a reliable alter native for the detection of ash pollen sensitization.

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{structure of}} the major birch pollen allergen, the 17, 500 M(r) acidic protein Bet v 1 (from the birch, Betula verrucosa), is presented as determined both in the crystalline state by X-ray diffraction and in solution by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This is the first experimentally determined structure of a clinically important inhalant major allergen, estimated to cause allergy in 5 - 10 million individuals worldwide. The structure shows three regions on the molecular surface predicted to harbour cross-reactive B-cell epitopes which provide a structural basis for the allergic symptoms that birch pollen allergic patients show when they encounter pollens from related trees such as <b>hazel,</b> <b>alder</b> and hornbeam. The structure also shows an unusual feature, a 30 A-long forked cavity that penetrates the entire protein...|$|E
40|$|Pollen of {{the white}} birch (Betula verrucosa) {{is one of the}} main causes of Type I {{allergic}} reactions (allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, allergic bronchial asthma) in Middle and Northern Europe, North America and the USSR. Type I allergies are a major threat to public health in these countries, since 10 - 15 % of the population suffer from these diseases. BetvI, an allergenic protein with an Mr of 17 kd is a constituent of the pollen of white birch and is responsible for IgE binding in more than 95 % of birch pollen allergic patients. Here, we report the complete nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of a cDNA clone coding for the major pollen allergen (BetvI) of white birch. It is similar to the N-terminal peptide sequences of the allergens of <b>hazel,</b> <b>alder</b> and hornbeam (close relatives) but it has no significant sequence homology to any other known allergens. However, it shows 55 % sequence identity with a pea disease resistance response gene, indicating that BetvI may be involved in pathogen resistance of pollen...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the phenological and {{quantitative}} {{changes in the}} pollen seasons between 1973 and 2013 in the Stockholm region of Sweden were studied for nine types of pollen (<b>hazel,</b> <b>alder,</b> elm, birch, oak, grass, mugwort, willow and pine). Linear regression models were used to estimate the long term trends in duration, start- and end-dates, peak-values and the yearly accumulated pollen sums of the pollen seasons. The pollen seasons of several arboreal plant species (e. g. birch, oak and pine) were found to start significantly earlier today compared to 41 years earlier, and have an earlier peak-date, while the season of other species seemed largely unaffected. However, the long term trends in the end-dates of pollen seasons differed between arboreal and herbaceous species. For herbaceous species (grass and mugwort), a significant change towards later end-dates was observed and the duration of season {{was found to have}} increased. A significant trend towards an earlier end-date was found in the majority of the arboreal plant species (i. e. elm, oak, pine and birch), but the length of the season seemed unaffected. A trend towards an increase in yearly concentrations of pollen was observed for several species; however the reasons for this phenomenon cannot be explained unambiguously by the present study design. The trend of increasing yearly mean air temperatures in the Stockholm area may be the reason to changed phenological patterns of pollen seasons...|$|E
40|$|The Zeri ewe is an {{indigenous}} Italian breed that is {{spread throughout the}} homonymous area located in northwest Tuscany. This article presents the history and evolution of Zerasca sheep, describes the breed’s characteristics in terms of somatic and productive traits, managerial and health practices, meat quality; moreover it underlines its contribution {{to the preservation of}} the rural land and population of the Zeri district. First documentation on this breed dates back to the 19 th Century (Antonelli, 1845). Zerasca breed has a medium-large size with white fleece. Males present horns while in females can be absent. Currently Zerasca ovine population totals more than 2, 000 heads. Sheep husbandry is currently predominant in Zeri area thanks to the great availability of woody vegetation (oak, chestnut, <b>hazel,</b> <b>alder</b> and beech trees), meadows and pastures. Animals’ nutrition depends mostly on grazing pastures, infact flocks are generally supported only with a little nutritional supplementation. The first typical production is the heavy lamb that is gaining more and more relevance thanks to its excellent meat quality, unique in taste; infact, Zeri lamb is included in the list of Slow Food Presidia, reflecting the recognized quality of this product in the world. Most of shepherds jointed in a consortium for the valorization and safeguarding of Zerasca sheep and lambs, whose regulation points towards the implementation of extensive farming systems with an optimal exploitation of local pasture resources. One of the most important problem that Zerasca sheep farmers often complain is represented by gastrointestinal parasitism, almost endemic in sheep husbandry and particularly in sheep raised under extensive systems. Today, “Zeri lamb” has a considerable economic impact on its territory, ensuring increasing profits for shepherds. The aim of this review is to collect information about a native breed in endangered status that it is gaining importance thanks to the high-quality of products...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the {{relation}} between clinical picture of allergic disease and the level of pollen count the patients are exposed to. Material and methodWe analyzed the severity of allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis and bronchial asthma in a group of 640 subjects from Warsaw area with hypersensitivity to <b>hazel,</b> <b>alder,</b> grass, mugwort, plantain, nettle, Alternaria and Cladosporium allergens. Aerobiological measurements, patients’ symptoms score cards and the results of physical examination were analyzed. ResultsFirst symptoms in patients allergic to grass were visible during exposure to the concentration of 20 pollen grains in 1 m 3 of air (25 % subjects sensitised to grass pollen). Symptoms were noted in all the subjects sensitized to grass pollen at a concentration of approximately 50 grains/m 3 of air. During exposure to the concentration of 65 pollen grains per m 3 the symptoms were strengthened. Several hours’ exposure to grass pollen concentration exceeding 120 grains/m 3 cause dyspnoea in some patients. Similar intensive symptoms occurred after exposure to alder, birch and mugwort pollen. Patients with positive skin prick tests to plantain and nettle pollen allergens experienced symptoms of low intensity or even none symptoms during pollination period. Subjects with hypersensitivity to Alternaria allergens experienced symptoms during exposure to the concentration of approximately 80 spores in 1 m 3 of air, while patients sensitised to Cladosporium allergens, during exposure to the concentration of over 2800 spores in 1 m 3 of air. The dominant symptom occurring in patients sensitized to fungal allergens was loss of nasal patency, and dyspnoea as well as recurring cough at higher concentrations. ConclusionsClinical symptoms of allergic disease were connected to the concentration and the kind of aeroallergen the subjects were exposed to...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} seasonal variations in concentrations of <b>hazel</b> and <b>alder</b> pollen count due to meteorological parameters. Measurements were performed using the volumetric method. The analysed meteorological parameters were the maximum temperature, relative humidity, rainfall and wind speed. The beginning and end of a season were established by the 95 % method. During seven years of study, the highest concentration of hazel pollen in the air was noted in 2003 (the total number was two - three times higher than in the other years), with the pollen season starting in most years in the beginning of January and lasting till the end of March or beginning of April. The highest concentration of alder pollen in the air was noted in 2003, similarly as hazel pollen. The pollen season started in the beginning of January (in 2003 and 2006 in the beginning of March) and lasted till the turn of the March and April. The highest pollen count of 674 grains×m - 3 was observed in the end of March. A positive and statistically signifi cant correlation (Pearson's coeffi cient and multiple regression) was found between the <b>hazel</b> and <b>alder</b> pollen concentration and air temperature and wind speed. A negative correlation was found in case of the relative humidity. A lot of analysed correlations were signifi cant (significance level of p= 0. 05), although the percentage of explained variation (R 2) was very low. Besides the individual rhythm of pollination, the meteorological conditions are the most important factors (mainly air temperature and wind speed) influencing the analysed pollen concentration in the air...|$|R
