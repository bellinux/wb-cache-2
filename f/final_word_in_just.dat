5000|$|The {{overture}} {{begins with}} four chords in the winds. Following the first {{theme in the}} parallel minor (E minor) representing the dancing fairies, a transition (the royal music of the court of Athens) leads to a second theme, that of the lovers. This {{is followed by the}} braying of Bottom with the [...] "hee-hawing" [...] being evoked by the strings. A final group of themes, reminiscent of craftsmen and hunting calls, brings the exposition to a close. The fairies dominate most of the development section, while the Lover's theme is played in a minor key. The recapitulation begins with the same opening four chords in the winds, followed by the Fairies theme and the other section in the second theme, including Bottom's braying. The fairies return, and ultimately have the <b>final</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> the coda, <b>just</b> as <b>in</b> Shakespeare's play. The overture ends once again with the same opening four chords by the winds.|$|R

In Round One, each word guessed was worth 10 points, but the <b>final</b> <b>word</b> guessed <b>in</b> that chain was worth 20 (changed to 15 in season two). In Round Two, these values escalated to 20 points each, and 40 points for the <b>final</b> <b>word.</b> Values for Round Three were again increased to 30 points each, and 60 for the <b>final</b> <b>word.</b> <b>In</b> the event that a fourth chain was needed to decide the game, the point values were 40 points per word and 80 for the <b>final</b> <b>word.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn an ERP study, {{following}} stimuli with a {{world knowledge}} violation we added a sentence-level context which made a world knowledge violation more acceptable in order to investigate how participants processed the subsequent sentence context. Sentences consisting of five Chinese words were of three experimental types: correct sentences with correct world knowledge and coherent sentence meaning, incoherent sentences {{with a world}} knowledge violation and incoherent sentence meaning, and ‘re-coherent’ sentences with a world knowledge violation but coherent sentence meaning. The results showed both incoherent and re-coherent conditions modulated N 400, elicited by the critical word which contained the world knowledge violation, and a negative deflection elicited by the <b>final</b> <b>word,</b> <b>in</b> a similar way, reflecting the immediate world knowledge integration of critical word and low predictability of <b>final</b> <b>word</b> respectively. An additional negative deflection was elicited only by the <b>final</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> the incoherent condition, probably reflecting global sentence context integration. These results provide support for immediate world knowledge integration, and indicate that subsequent new sentence context can immediately influence previous world knowledge constraints...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} measure the initial portion of signal {{required}} for the correct identification of auditory speech stimuli (or isolation points, IPs) in silence and noise, and to investigate the relationships between auditory and cognitive functions in silence and noise. Twenty-one university students were presented with auditory stimuli in a gating paradigm for the identification of consonants, <b>words,</b> and <b>final</b> <b>words</b> <b>in</b> highly predictable and low predictable sentences. The Hearing in Noise Test (HINT), the reading span test, and the Paced Auditory Serial Attention Test were also administered to measure speech-in-noise ability, working memory and attentional capacities of the participants, respectively. The results showed that noise delayed the identification of consonants, <b>words,</b> and <b>final</b> <b>words</b> <b>in</b> highly predictable and low predictable sentences. HINT performance correlated with working memory and attentional capacities. In the noise condition, there were correlations between HINT performance, cognitive task performance, and the IPs of consonants and <b>words.</b> <b>In</b> the silent condition, there were no correlations between auditory and cognitive tasks. In conclusion, a combination of hearing-in-noise ability, working memory capacity, and attention capacity is needed for the early identification of consonants and <b>words</b> <b>in</b> noise...|$|R
50|$|Each chain {{comprised}} seven words. The {{teams were}} reduced to two civilian players each and each was given one responsibility. One teammate was the letter giver and decided whether to give {{a letter to his}} or her partner or to other team's word guesser.

In Round One, each word guessed was worth 10 points, but the <b>final</b> <b>word</b> guessed <b>in</b> that chain was worth 20 (changed to 15 in season two). In Round Two, these values escalated to 20 points each and 40 points for the <b>final</b> <b>word.</b> <b>In</b> the event that a fourth chain was needed to decide the game, the point values were 40 points per word and 80 for the <b>final</b> <b>word.</b> The first team to score 200 points won the game.

50|$|In {{sentences}} involving focused words and/or phrases, {{the rising}} tones only last until the focused word; all following words carry a low tone. This intonation pattern extends to wh-questions, as wh-words are normally {{considered to be}} focused. In yes-no questions, the rising tones may be more exaggerated, and most importantly, the final syllable of the <b>final</b> <b>word</b> <b>in</b> the sentence takes a high falling tone instead of a flat low tone.|$|R
