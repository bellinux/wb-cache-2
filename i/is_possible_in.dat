5|$|Finally, the New Centenary Camp (1 – 4 August 2007) hosted Scouts {{from both}} the United Kingdom and abroad, celebrating {{the start of the}} second century for Scouting. Scouts from all {{backgrounds}} and religions came together to show the world that peace <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>in</b> the same way that Baden-Powell brought together boys from different classes for the first camp back in 1907.|$|E
5|$|Mono Lake {{itself has}} {{its own set of}} activities, {{including}} walking tours among towers of tufa, boat tours of the lake, and birdwatching opportunities. The lake is too salty to support any fish, but fishing <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>in</b> streams that feed Mono Lake. Additional activities include hiking around and on the craters and domes, and mountain biking outside of the Scenic Area boundaries.|$|E
5|$|Normally, {{five players}} {{play in a}} {{standard}} round of Evolve, with four Hunters fighting one Monster. Playing with less than five players, including single player, <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>in</b> all modes due to computer-controlled bots. These bots can control up to four of the characters, allowing between one and four human players in any game mode. Players can also switch to play as another class instantly in a single-player match.|$|E

5|$|A back-building thunderstorm, {{commonly}} referred to as a training thunderstorm, is a thunderstorm in which new development takes place on the upwind side (usually the west or southwest side in the Northern Hemisphere), such that the storm seems to remain stationary or propagate in a backward direction. Though the storm often appears stationary on radar, or even moving upwind, this is an illusion. The storm is really a multi-cell storm with new, more vigorous cells that form on the upwind side, replacing older cells that continue to drift downwind. When this happens, catastrophic flooding <b>is</b> <b>possible.</b> <b>In</b> Rapid City, South Dakota, in 1972, an unusual alignment of winds at various levels of the atmosphere combined to produce a continuously training set of cells that dropped an enormous quantity of rain upon the same area, resulting in devastating flash flooding. A similar event occurred in Boscastle, England, on 16 August 2004.|$|E
5|$|A {{cylinder}} boot is a {{hard rubber}} or plastic cover which fits over {{the base of a}} diving cylinder to protect the paint from abrasion and impact, to protect the surface the cylinder stands on from impact with the cylinder, {{and in the case of}} round bottomed cylinders, to allow the cylinder to stand upright on its base. Some boots have flats moulded into the plastic to reduce the tendency of the cylinder to roll on a flat surface. It <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>in</b> some cases for water to be trapped between the boot and the cylinder, and if this is seawater and the paint under the boot is in poor condition, the surface of the cylinder may corrode in those areas. This can usually be avoided by rinsing in fresh water after use and storing in a dry place. The added hydrodynamic drag caused by a cylinder boot is trivial in comparison with the overall drag of the diver, but some boot styles may present a slightly increased risk of snagging on the environment.|$|E

5|$|Broken Sword: The Angel of Death uses both a {{point and}} click and direct control interface. The player guides George Stobbart's {{movements}} with a mouse or keyboard, and Nicole Collard {{is also a}} playable character in selected portions of the game. George must collect objects {{that can be used}} with other collectible objects, parts of the scenery, or other people in the game world to solve puzzles and progress in the game. George can engage in dialogue with other characters through conversation trees to gain hints of {{what needs to be done}} to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot. As in the first three Broken Sword games, the death of the player character <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>in</b> The Angel of Death.|$|E
5|$|Magnetism as a {{property}} of matter {{has been known}} in China since 4000 BC. However, the first modern studies of magnetism only started {{with the development of}} electrodynamics by Faraday, Maxwell and others in the nineteenth century, which included classifying materials as ferromagnetic, paramagnetic and diamagnetic based on their response to magnetization. Pierre Curie studied the dependence of magnetization on temperature and discovered the Curie point phase transition in ferromagnetic materials. In 1906, Pierre Weiss introduced the concept of magnetic domains to explain the main properties of ferromagnets. The first attempt at a microscopic description of magnetism was by Wilhelm Lenz and Ernst Ising through the Ising model that described magnetic materials as consisting of a periodic lattice of spins that collectively acquired magnetization. The Ising model was solved exactly to show that spontaneous magnetization cannot occur in one dimension but <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>in</b> higher-dimensional lattices. Further research such as by Bloch on spin waves and Néel on antiferromagnetism led to developing new magnetic materials with applications to magnetic storage devices.|$|E
5|$|Muscles and nerves {{that control}} the {{digestive}} process may be affected by PD, resulting in constipation and gastroparesis (food remaining in the stomach {{for a longer period}} than normal). A balanced diet, based on periodical nutritional assessments, is recommended and should be designed to avoid weight loss or gain and minimize consequences of gastrointestinal dysfunction. As the disease advances, swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) may appear. In such cases it may be helpful to use thickening agents for liquid intake and an upright posture when eating, both measures reducing the risk of choking. Gastrostomy to deliver food directly into the stomach <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>in</b> severe cases.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of tropical cyclones in the Mediterranean Sea can usually only occur under somewhat unusual circumstances. Low wind shear and atmospheric instability induced by incursions {{of cold air}} are often required. A majority of medicanes are also accompanied by upper-level troughs, providing energy required for intensifying atmospheric convection—thunderstorms—and heavy precipitation. The baroclinic properties of the Mediterranean region, with high temperature gradients, also provides necessary instability {{for the formation of}} tropical cyclones. Another factor, rising cool air, provides necessary moisture as well. Warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are mostly unnecessary, however, as most medicanes' energy is derived from warmer air temperatures. When these favorable circumstances coincide, the genesis of warm-core Mediterranean tropical cyclones, often from within existing cut-off cold-core lows, <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>in</b> a conducive environment for formation.|$|E
5|$|Some mammals {{have a large}} larynx {{and thus}} a {{low-pitched}} voice, namely the hammer-headed bat (Hypsignathus monstrosus) where the larynx can take up {{the entirety of the}} thoracic cavity while pushing the lungs, heart, and trachea into the abdomen. Large vocal pads can also lower the pitch, as in the low-pitched roars of big cats. The production of infrasound <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>in</b> some mammals such as the African elephant (Loxodonta spp.) and baleen whales. Small mammals with small larynxes have the ability to produced ultrasound, which can be detected by modifications to the middle ear and cochlea. Ultrasound is inaudible to birds and reptiles, which might have been important during the Mesozoic, when birds and reptiles were the dominant predators. This private channel is used by some rodents in, for example, mother-to-pup communication, and by bats when echolocating. Toothed whales also use echolocation, but, as opposed to the vocal membrane that extends upward from the vocal folds, they have a melon to manipulate sounds. Some mammals, namely the primates, have air sacs attached to the larynx, which may function to increase the volume of sound.|$|E
