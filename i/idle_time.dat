5|$|The {{process of}} garbage {{collection}} involves reading and rewriting {{data to the}} flash memory. This means that a new write from the host will first require a read of the whole block, a write of {{the parts of the}} block which still include valid data, and then a write of the new data. This can significantly reduce the performance of the system. Some SSD controllers implement background garbage collection (BGC), sometimes called idle garbage collection or idle-time garbage collection (ITGC), where the controller uses <b>idle</b> <b>time</b> to consolidate blocks of flash memory before the host needs to write new data. This enables the performance of the device to remain high.|$|E

40|$|Temporal {{dependence}} {{has been}} identified as an important characteristic in workloads processed by multi-tier architectures, disk drives, and communication networks. In this paper, we discuss how to use the knowledge of temporal dependence in flows to forecast the length of idle intervals in storage systems. We design a new background scheduling policy to determine when and for how long <b>idle</b> <b>times</b> can be used for serving background tasks, without violating pre-defined performance targets of foreground jobs. Our analysis shows that if <b>idle</b> <b>times</b> have low variability, then {{it is not necessary to}} idle wait before starting a background job. Only if <b>idle</b> <b>times</b> are highly variable, then idle waiting is necessary to minimize the impact of background activity on foreground performance. We further show that if there is burstiness in addition to high variability in idle intervals, then it is possible to predict accurately the length of incoming <b>idle</b> <b>times</b> and use that information to serve more background jobs without affecting foreground performance. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a theoretical estimation for <b>idle</b> channel <b>time</b> in a multi-hop environment. <b>Idle</b> channel <b>time</b> {{is the time}} proportion of a node during which the channel state is idle. Thus, {{it can be used}} to evaluate the available bandwidth. Major related work considers a cross-layer model, where the <b>idle</b> channel <b>time</b> measure is available at the MAC layer, but it is rarely implemented. Furthermore, this measure is not very flexible: it cannot differentiate the traffic’s priorities and it works under the hypothesis that flows are strictly policed. Estimating instead of measuring the <b>idle</b> channel <b>time</b> prevents these drawbacks. This estimation is computed in three steps by (1) calculating the <b>idle</b> channel <b>time</b> bounds, (2) evaluating the probability of a given <b>idle</b> channel <b>time</b> value, (3) computing the expected value of this distribution and deducing the average <b>idle</b> channel <b>time.</b> We show by simulation that our estimation is accurate.

40|$|The {{uncertainties}} {{inherent in}} the airport flight arrival and departure traffic {{may lead to the}} unavailability of gates when needed to accommodate scheduled flights. Mechanical failures, severe weather conditions, heavy traffic volume at the airport are some typical causes of the uncertainties in the input data. Incorporating such random disruptions is crucial in constructing effective flight-gate assignment plans. We consider the flight-gate assignment problem in the presence of uncertainty in arrival and departure times of the flights and represent the randomness associated with these uncertain parameters by a finite set of scenarios. Using the scenario-based approach, we develop new stochastic programming models incorporating alternate robustness measures to obtain assignments that would perform well under potential random disruptions. In particular, we focus on the number of confficting flights, the buffer and <b>idle</b> <b>times</b> as robustness measures. Minimizing the expected variance of <b>idle</b> <b>times</b> or the expected semi-deviation of <b>idle</b> <b>times</b> from a buffer time value are some examples of the objectives that we incorporate in our models to appropriately distribute the <b>idle</b> <b>times</b> among gates, and by this way, to decrease the number of potential flight confficts. The proposed stochastic optimization models are formulated as computationally expensive large-scale mixed-integer programming problems, which are hard to solve. In order to find good feasible solutions in reasonably short CPU times, we employ tabu search algorithms. We conduct an extensive computational study to analyze the proposed alternate formulations and show the computational effectiveness of the proposed solution methods...|$|R

25|$|Admiral Rodionov, {{chief of}} the Department of Construction, {{estimated}} that the lead ship could be launched {{in the spring of}} 1906 and be ready for a shooting practice in the spring of 1907. By the end of 1903 this schedule was already broken by a confusion over working drawings. Both master builders (Skvortsov for the New Admiraly and Ratnik for Baltic Shipyard) complained about poorly executed drafts. Ratnik noticed that the bilge keels added by the NTC did not fit into existing drydocks of his yard. He again alerted the admirals of the inevitable overload and demanded redesign of belt armor to match the expected rise in waterline level. According to Skvortsov, the proposed technology called for unnecessary breaks in construction schedule because deck armor could only be ordered and made to measure after completion of underlying structure. He proposed replacement of armor deck with softer steel which could be cut on site, saving a whole year of <b>idle</b> <b>time,</b> but the NTC insisted on following the original plan.|$|E

40|$|Various {{activities}} that intend to enhance performance, reliability, {{and availability of}} storage systems are scheduled with low priority and served during <b>idle</b> <b>times.</b> Under such conditions, idleness becomes a valuable “resource ” {{that needs to be}} efficiently managed. A common approach in system design is to be nonwork conserving by “idle waiting”, that is, delay the scheduling of background jobs to avoid slowing down upcoming foreground tasks. In this article, we complement “idle waiting ” with the “estimation ” of background work to be served in every idle interval to effectively manage the trade-off between the performance of foreground and background tasks. As a result, the storage system is better utilized without compromising foreground performance. Our analysis shows that if <b>idle</b> <b>times</b> have low variability, then idle waiting is not necessary. Only if <b>idle</b> <b>times</b> are highly variable does idle waiting become necessary to minimize the impact of background activity on foreground performance.
