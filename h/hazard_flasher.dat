In {{vehicles with}} a single green turn signal tell-tale on the dashboard, a separate red tell-tale must be provided for <b>hazard</b> <b>flasher</b> indication. Because the <b>hazard</b> <b>flasher</b> function operates the vehicle's left and right turn signals, a left or a right turn signal function may not be provided while the hazard flashers are operating, although the vehicle may activate the indicator {{and return to the}} hazard flashing phase once the indicator is deactivated.|$|E
2500|$|... 1967 saw the {{introduction}} of U.S. mandated safety equipment to improve occupant protection during a crash, including an energy-absorbing steering column, non-protruding control knobs, 4-way <b>hazard</b> <b>flasher,</b> soft interior surfaces, locking seat backs (on 2-door models), a dual-circuit hydraulic braking system (with warning light), and shoulder belt anchors. [...] The Rivieras complied on all counts and featured {{the full range of}} safety features.|$|E
2500|$|The Valiant was {{completely}} redesigned for 1967 model {{year and the}} station wagons, hardtops, and convertibles were dropped. Buyers who wanted a Valiant-type hardtop coupe or convertible could choose a similarly-styled Barracuda, which was still based on the Valiant with a slightly sportier style. [...] The new Valiant model range included 2- and 4-door sedans on a newly lengthened [...] wheelbase. The design was straightforward and rectilinear. The body sides were mildly sculptured with a tapering lower feature line that widened toward the wheels. The new fenders had a vertical slab look. The grille was vertically split and subdivided horizontally. Vertical taillights were segmented and had a fanned-out look. Horsepower rating for the [...] Slant-6 engine was raised from [...] to [...] by installation of the slightly bigger camshaft introduced on the 225 in 1965, together with Carter BBS and Holley 1920 carburetors using the larger [...] throttle bore previously reserved for the 225, rather than the smaller [...] carburetors formerly used on the 170 engine. [...] Federally-mandated safety equipment was provided on all 1967s, including a new dual-chamber brake master cylinder, energy-absorbing steering column, wheel, and instrument panel controls; shoulder belt mountings for outboard front passengers, a new 4-way <b>hazard</b> <b>flasher,</b> and, for 1970, lane-change directional signals were included.|$|E
25|$|New options {{included}} an automatic air conditioning system. This system, first introduced by Cadillac in 1964, {{was available in}} addition to the regular Circ-L-Aire Conditioning. <b>Hazard</b> <b>flashers</b> were also optional.|$|R
5000|$|... 1973: <b>Hazard</b> <b>flashers</b> {{introduced}} on UK models. Also {{with the}} Austin/Morris 1800, there are body {{changes to the}} Maxi to simplify production and reduce costs (the A posts are no longer lead loaded).|$|R
25|$|An {{additional}} base E model {{was introduced to}} the range in 1980, aimed at fleets and budget-minded buyers, using the four-door bodyshell. This car was incredibly spartan – fitted with plain wheels and vinyl seats – and lacked reversing lamps, <b>hazard</b> <b>flashers,</b> radio and many gauges.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to new controls for D-Mode and cruise control, several controls are different. There's a new rocker {{on the left}} hand grip that controls the heated grips and which page is displayed on the information panel; which function the rocker provides is controlled by a trigger switch near the left forefinger. The stop/run rocker is now stop/run/start with the last position being momentary; the <b>hazard</b> <b>flasher</b> button is where the starter button was previously located. A similar rocker switch for headlight control provides high/low/flash controls.|$|E

2500|$|Also called [...] "hazards", [...] "hazard warning flashers", [...] "hazard warning lights", [...] "emergency lights", [...] "4-way flashers", {{or simply}} [...] "flashers". International {{regulations}} require vehicles to {{be equipped with}} a control which, when activated, flashes {{the left and right}} directional signals, front and rear, {{all at the same time}} and in phase. Operation of the <b>hazard</b> <b>flashers</b> must be from a control independent of the turn signal control, and an audiovisual tell-tale must be provided to the driver.|$|R
5000|$|Both [...] "S" [...] bikes, the ST4s and ST3s, {{could be}} {{equipped}} with ABS from 2003. In 2004, an upgrade to the ST line brought a modified nose fairing and dashboard, adjustable ergonomics, a trip computer, four-way (<b>hazard)</b> <b>flashers,</b> digital speedometer, a dashboard-controlled adjustable headlight, a new seat design, Euro-2 catalytic exhaust, and a simplified CAN-bus wiring setup. Dry weight was reduced by 11 kg due to the lighter wiring harness and simpler support structure for {{the nose of the}} bike.|$|R
2500|$|Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, and BMW have {{released}} vehicles equipped {{to convey a}} special light signal when the vehicle is braked rapidly and severely. This is officially referred to as [...] "emergency stop signal", and UN Regulation 48 calls for the lamps providing the ESS to flash at 4 Hz when a passenger car decelerates at greater than 6m/s2 or a truck or bus decelerates at greater than 4m/s2.

5000|$|Over {{the course}} of decades, {{the design of the}} Trabant changed little. This caused the {{increasingly}} obsolete Trabant's reputation to worsen. This however had little effect on the sales figures - wait times of 10 years or longer for a new car were not uncommon. The price for a new Trabant in 1985 was 8,500 Mark for the 601 Standard, and 9,700 Mark for the most expensive model, the 601 Universal S de Luxe.

25|$|The 1967 {{model year}} {{also saw the}} {{addition}} of the new safety standards for passenger cars mandated by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The regulations began with seat belts on automobiles produced after March 1, 1967. The 1967 Rambler Americans also included a collapsible, energy-absorbing steering column and steering wheel, more padding on interior surfaces, 4-way <b>hazard</b> <b>flashers,</b> and locking seat back latches for 2-door models. The instrument cluster was changed from the previous rectangular design to round gauges: The speedometer and odometer was center, with twin, smaller fuel and engine temperature gauges, with matching warning-light pods {{on both sides of the}} speedometer.|$|R
2500|$|Detail {{improvements}} {{continued to}} be made throughout {{the life of the}} Mark IV, and included reclining seats with [...] "chequered brushed nylon centre panels" [...] and head restraints, introduced for domestic market cars early in 1977 along with a new set of column stalk operated minor controls (as fitted already in the TR7) replacing the old dashboard mounted knobs and switches. [...] Also added for the model's final years were a wood dash, <b>hazard</b> <b>flashers</b> and an electric screen washer, in place of the previous manual pump operated ones. Options such as the hard top, tonneau cover, map light and overdrive {{continued to be}} popular, but wire wheels ceased to be available.|$|R
5000|$|Only {{minor changes}} {{were made to the}} 1967 Tempest, Custom and Le Mans models. The GTO 389 cu. in. V-8 was {{replaced}} by a new 400 cu. in. V-8. The Rochester 4bbl. carburetor replaced both the standard GTO Carter AFB 4bbl and the 3 × 2bbl. carburetor option. The Turbo Hydromatic TH-400 replaced the previous Buick Super Turbine two speed automatic. The 326 cu. in. V-8's remained unchanged. The 4bbl. OHC six was uprated to [...] Front disc brakes were a new option along with a stereo 8-track tape player and hood-mounted tachometer. All 1967 Pontiacs got GM's safety package, mandated by Federal law, which included a dual-circuit braking system, energy absorbing steering column, wheel, and interior, shoulder belt anchors, four-way <b>hazard</b> <b>flashers,</b> and a new directional signal control that could be [...] "flicked" [...] for lane changes.|$|R
50|$|Minor trim {{changes were}} {{introduced}} for 1967 as the Fairlane was mildly facelifted. The 289 CID small-block became the base V8, with a 200 CID six standard, with the 390 CID optional (with either two- or four-barrel carburetor, at 275 and , respectively). The 427s were still available, either {{with a single}} four-barrel carburetor or dual quad carbs, developing 410 (W-code) and 425 bhp (R-code), 427s were available on XL models, but very few were built. The notable addition for the 1967 model year was a Ranchero pickup {{as part of the}} Fairlane range (from 1960 to 1965, the Ranchero was based on the Falcon, while in 1966 it used the Fairlane platform but Falcon styling). The 1967 Fairlanes also included a number of federal government-mandated safety features, including a new energy-absorbing steering column with a large padded steering wheel hub, soft interior trim, four-way <b>hazard</b> <b>flashers,</b> a dual-chamber braking system, and shoulder belt anchors. The convertible had a tempered safety glass rear window.|$|R
5000|$|The Halifax {{plant was}} {{unlike any other}} {{assembly}} plant Volvo was operating at the time. This was mainly due to the plant's trademark team system that assembled the entire vehicle at one station, which was extensively used later at Volvo Torslanda Assembly and then Volvo Kalmar Assembly. In 1966, annual production totaled over 3,700 cars. Volvo 122 S, 123 GT and 122 B18s were assembled in Halifax initially, the Volvo PV544 was introduced a year later. Halifax built 123 GT models like the 122 S were rebadged as [...] "Canadian GT"s. Units produced at the plant typically came without auxiliary lights and had only one side view mirror, but came with a limited-slip differential and <b>hazard</b> <b>flashers.</b> Halifax built Canadian GTs were available in colours such as light green (91), light blue (95), and dark blue (96) and are often seen with identification codes 5145 or 5324. For three years the plant operated out of a harbourfront facility (an old sugar processing plant) located on Halifax Harbour's Eastern Passage.|$|R
40|$|In July 2005 the North American Solar Challenge (NASC) {{featured}} university built solar powered cars {{ran across}} the United States into Canada. The competition began in Austin, Texas with stops in Weatherford, Texas; Broken Arrow, Oklahoma; Topeka, Kansas; Omaha, Nebraska; Sioux Falls, South Dakota, Fargo, North Dakota; Winnipeg, Manitoba; Brandon, Manitoba; Regina, Saskatchewan; Medicine Hat, Alberta; mainly following U. S. Highway 75 and Canadian Highway 1 {{to the finish line}} in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, for a total distance of 2, 500 miles. NASC major sponsors include the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE), Natural Resources Canada and DOEs National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The event is designed to inspire young people to pursue careers in science and engineering. NASCs predecessors, the American Solar Challenge and Sunrayce, generally have been held every two years since 1990. With each race, the solar cars travel faster and further with greater reliability. The NASC promotes: -Renewable energy technologies (specifically photovoltaic or solar cells) -Educational excellence in science, engineering and mathematics -Creative integration of technical and scientific expertise across a wide-range of disciplines -Hands-on experience for students and engineers to develop and demonstrate their technical and creative abilities. Safety is the first priority for the NASC. Each team put its car through grueling qualifying and technical inspections. Teams that failed to meet the requirements were not allowed participate. During the race, each team was escorted by lead and chase vehicles sporting rooftop <b>hazard</b> <b>flashers.</b> An official observer accompanied each solar car team to keep it alert to any safety issues...|$|R
40|$|Rural two-lane {{highways}} {{compose a}} large {{percent of the}} highway system nationwide. Preserving, expending, and enhancing these highways result in many one-lane, two-way work zones that have caused a safety concern for the traveling public. Aimed at reducing crashes attributed to inattentive driving in these work zones, a new traffic warning sign was proposed, which was assembled using the <b>hazard</b> warning <b>flashers</b> of motor vehicles. This warning sign, named as the Emergency Flasher Traffic Control Device (EFTCD), is flexible and cost-effective and particularly benefits the rural one-lane, two-way work zones that are frequently moved due to construction progress. This research project evaluated {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed EFTCD by comparing the speeds with and without the EFTCD and analyzing survey results in three one-lane, two-way work zones in Kansas. Study results showed that the EFTCD effectively reduced the mean speeds in work zones as well as the proportions of high speed vehicles. In addition, the EFTCD successfully captured the attention of most drivers when they were approaching the work zones. A majority of the surveyed drivers recommended the implementation of thi...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the start}} of 1976 the {{relatively}} large 1800 cc Vauxhall Victor came with a recommended sticker price {{lower than that of}} the more modern but smaller and relatively well equipped Vauxhall Cavalier GL, which will have encouraged fleet managers to negotiate for higher discounts on the Cavalier and left the basic Victor looking embarrassingly underpriced. To try to move the Victor upmarket, Vauxhall upgraded the trim level of the basic Victor 1800 cc to match that of the 2300 cc version, with improvements that included fabric seat trim, a new clarified instrument display embellished with mock timber surround as well as a new central console. Seat belts and <b>hazard</b> warning <b>flashers</b> were now included in the recommended price across the range. Under the bonnet / hood various upgrades were made to the 1800 cc engine which now offered [...] of output in place of the [...] previously claimed. The changes carried a weight penalty, but performance was nevertheless usefully improved with top speed up from 89 mph (143 km/h) to 100 mph (161 km/h). To draw attention to the changes Vauxhall also dropped the Victor name, and the car, which also replaced the Victor-based VX4/90, became the Vauxhall VX in January 1976. The VX Series is distinguished from the outside by a simplified grille and revised headlights.|$|R
