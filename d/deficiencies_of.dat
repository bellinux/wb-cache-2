They highlighted the <b>deficiencies</b> <b>of</b> the program: commitment procedures in Alaska were archaic, and the long trip to Portland had a negative effect on patients and their families. In addition, an audit of the hospital contract found that the Sanatorium Company, which owned the hospital, had been padding its expenses. This had enabled it to make an excess profit of $69,000 per year (equivalent to over $588,000 per year at 2007 prices).|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{economics}} {{is the critical}} study of economics including its methodology, epistemology, history and empirical research, attempting to overcome androcentric (male and patriarchal) biases. It focuses on topics of particular relevance to women, such as care work or occupational segregation (exclusion of women and minorities from certain fields); <b>deficiencies</b> <b>of</b> economic models, such as disregarding intra-household bargaining; new forms of data collection and measurement such as the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM), and more gender-aware theories such as the capabilities approach. Feminist economics ultimately seeks to produce a more gender inclusive economics.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} {{classification}} of common symptoms {{and the laws of}} syndrome element combination in 251 cases of stable angina pectoris (SAP) by using cluster analysis and corresponding-correlation analysis. Methods: A total of 251 SAP cases were selected and their information from four diagnosis in traditional Chinese medicine was recorded. The classification of common symptom and the laws of syndrome element combination were investigated by cluster analysis and corresponding-correlation analysis. Results: Twenty-five symptoms found in 251 SAP cases were divided into four types by cluster analysis: <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> heart qi, <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> spleen qi, <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> qi and yin, and phlegm accumulation and blood stasis. The <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> heart qi had the closest relation to phlegm accumulation and blood stasis. By corresponding-correlation analysis, the <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> qi had the closest relation to blood stasis, next was turbid phlegm and heat stagnation, and then <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> qi and <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> yin. Conclusion: Blood stasis due to deficient qi is the key factor in pathogenesis <b>of</b> SAP. <b>Deficiency</b> <b>of</b> qi plus blood stasis, <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> qi plus <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> yin, blood stasis plus turbid phlegm, <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> heart qi plus blood stasis plus turbid phlegm are common syndrome element combinations of SAP.

5|$|Special {{investigations}} may be {{indicated to}} rule out other causes of oral ulceration. These include blood tests to exclude anemia, <b>deficiencies</b> <b>of</b> iron, folate or vitamin B12 or celiac disease. However, the nutritional deficiencies may be latent and the peripheral blood picture may appear relatively normal. Some suggest that screening for celiac disease should form part of the routine work up for individuals complaining of recurrent oral ulceration. Many of the systemic diseases cause other symptoms apart from oral ulceration, which {{is in contrast to}} aphthous stomatitis where there is isolated oral ulceration. Patch testing may be indicated if allergies are suspected (e.g. a strong relationship between certain foods and episodes of ulceration). Several drugs can cause oral ulceration (e.g. nicorandil), and a trial substitution to an alternative drug may highlight a causal relationship.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{explore the}} {{characteristics}} of traditional Chinese medical syndrome (TCM syndrome) of hepatocirrhosis. Methods Clinical information from the four diagnosis methods of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and related laboratorial indexes were systematically collected from 223 hepatocirrhosis cases, and the multi-statistical methods including systematic cluster analysis, principal component analysis, stepwise discrimination and variance analysis were made with the software SAS 6. 11. Results Multi-analysis showed that there were 3 categories of syndrome characteristics. Type 1 (134 cases) : damp heat, blood stasis, <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> liver and spleen Qi; Type 2 (62 cases) : <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> both Qi and Yin with severe <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> Qi, heat with severe dampness, blood stasis; Type 3 (27 cases) : <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> both Qi and Yin with severe <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> Yin, stasis and heat or dampness. Analysis of the changes of the related laboratorial indexes among {{the three types of}} syndrome showed that Type 1 mainly manifested asthenia syndrome with sthenia syndrome, and its indexes of AST、ALT、GGT levels were markedly higher than those of Type 2 and Type 3, both of which mainly showed sthenia syndrome with asthenia syndrome, and that Type 3 was in active inflammation, <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> both Qi and Yin (<b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> Yin > <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> Qi), and its FN、Alb、FⅤ、FⅦ、PLT、PCT levels were obviously reduced. Conclusion The multi-statistical methods can reveal the characteristics and regularity of TCM syndrome of hepatocirrhosis, and the 3 categories of syndrome characteristics basically conform to clinical manifestations. The result of TCM syndrome distribution and laboratorial indexes infer that damp heat is the pathological basis of hepatocirrhosis, and the degree of liver function disorder and liver damage may be the pathological basis <b>of</b> <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> Yin of both liver and kidney...|$|R
5|$|The main {{literary}} {{sources for}} the 4th-century army are the Res Gestae (History) of Ammianus Marcellinus, whose surviving books cover the period 353 to 378. Marcellinus, himself a veteran soldier, is regarded by scholars as a reliable and valuable source. But he largely fails to remedy the <b>deficiencies</b> <b>of</b> the Notitia as regards army and unit strength or units in existence, as he is rarely specific about either. The third major source for the late army is the corpus of imperial decrees published in the East Roman empire in the 5th and 6th centuries: the Theodosian code (438) and the Corpus Iuris Civilis (528–39). These compilations of Roman laws dating from the 4th century contain numerous imperial decrees relating to {{all aspects of the}} regulation and administration of the late army.|$|E
5|$|The {{perceived}} <b>deficiencies</b> <b>of</b> the Laplacian model stimulated {{scientists to}} find a replacement for it. During the 20th century many theories addressed the issue, including the planetesimal theory of Thomas Chamberlin and Forest Moulton (1901), the tidal model of Jeans (1917), the accretion model of Otto Schmidt (1944), the protoplanet theory of William McCrea (1960) and finally the capture theory of Michael Woolfson. In 1978 Andrew Prentice resurrected the initial Laplacian ideas about planet formation and developed the modern Laplacian theory.

5|$|Exposure occurs through inhalation, {{ingestion}} or occasionally skin contact. Lead may {{be taken}} in through direct contact with mouth, nose, and eyes (mucous membranes), and through breaks in the skin. Tetraethyllead, which was a gasoline additive and is still used in fuels such as aviation fuel, passes through the skin; however inorganic lead found in paint, food, and most lead-containing consumer products is only minimally absorbed through the skin. The main sources of absorption of inorganic lead are from ingestion and inhalation. In adults, about 35–40% of inhaled lead dust is deposited in the lungs, and about 95% of {{that goes into the}} bloodstream. Of ingested inorganic lead, about 15% is absorbed, but this percentage is higher in children, pregnant women, and people with <b>deficiencies</b> <b>of</b> calcium, zinc, or iron. Infants may absorb about 50% of ingested lead, but little is known about absorption rates in children.|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} vitamin D {{is at the}} {{forefront}} of scientific research because of its huge impact on human health. Vitamin D plays pivotal roles in metabolism of bones by regulation of their mineralization and building. Dysfunction or <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> vitamin D can lead to occurrence of many diseases like osteoporosis, rickets and osteomalacia. In the archeological studies of my bachelor's essay I have mentioned that <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> vitamin D was also found in last human population. There is no difference in present. In March in 2010 was published 59 % of people are affected by <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> vitamin D and 25 % from them are affected by acute <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> vitamin D (Gilsanz et al., 2010). <b>Deficiency</b> <b>of</b> vitamin D is typically for people who don't expose for the Sun and eat poor food for vitamin D, for women after menopause and for people afflicted with failure of kidney, liver, intestine absorption and hyperparathyroidism. <b>Deficiency</b> <b>of</b> vitamin D is the most critical for children because of disrupting their growing of cartilages, bones and teeth. Bones begin soft, fragile and usually are deformed by weight of body. Disease with these symptoms is known like rickets. In adults <b>deficiency</b> <b>of</b> vitamin D can cause bad accumulation of calcium in bones and so bones are demineralized, thin, soft and easy to deform [...] . ...|$|R

Near Borough, the new tunnels would branch off to London Bridge to form an interchange with the mainline station and then north through the City of London to Angel. The plan was approved on 24 August 1893 following a delay. The Act also incorporated another bill of 1893 to grant more time to build the southern extension to Clapham. The new route and {{the first section of}} the northern extension from Borough to Moorgate opened on 25 February 1900, and the King William Street diversion was closed.

The bill was rejected {{on the grounds that the}} extension failed to make a connection to the existing line. In November 1891, the C published details of a revised bill for the extension to Islington. The company had recognised the <b>deficiencies</b> <b>of</b> its King William Street station and, just a year after the line had opened, planned to construct a new pair of tunnels to bypass the problematic northern section.|$|E
5|$|The disease term venous {{thromboembolism}} (VTE) {{includes the}} development of either DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE). Genetic factors that {{increase the risk of}} VTE include <b>deficiencies</b> <b>of</b> three proteins that normally prevent blood from clotting—protein C, protein S, and antithrombin—in addition to non-O blood type and mutations in the factor V and prothrombin genes. Deficiencies in antithrombin, protein C, and protein S are rare but strong, or moderately strong, risk factors. These three thrombophilia increase the risk of VTE by about 10 times. Factor V Leiden, which makes factor V resistant to inactivation by activated protein C, and the genetic variant prothrombin G20210A, which causes increased prothrombin levels, are predominantly expressed in Caucasians. They moderately increase risk for VTE, by three to eight times for factor V Leiden and two to three times for prothrombin G20210A. Having a non-O blood type roughly doubles VTE risk. Non-O blood type is common in all races, making it an important risk factor. Individuals without O blood type have higher blood levels of von Willebrand factor and factor VIII than those with O blood type, increasing the likelihood of clotting.|$|E
