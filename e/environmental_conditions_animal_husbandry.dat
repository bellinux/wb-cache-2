40|$|A rise in Salmonella typhimurium {{infection}} {{was observed}} in calves in Britain during 1964 – 6, follwing {{the adoption of the}} intensive farming method. A single phage type of S. typhimurium, type 29, was incriminated as the major pathogen.

The transmission of drug-resistant type 29, directly or indirectly, from bovines to man resulted in many human infections. Transferable drug resistance reaching man from enterobacteria of animal origin may ultimately enter specifically human pathogens.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundDendrites often display remarkably {{complex and}} diverse morphologies that are {{influenced}} by developmental and environmental cues. Neuroplasticity in response to adverse <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> entails both hypertrophy and resorption of dendrites. How dendrites rapidly alter morphology in response to unfavorable <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions</b> is unclear. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans enters into a stress-resistant dauer larval stage {{in response to an}} adverse environment. ResultsHere we show that the IL 2 bipolar sensory neurons undergo dendrite arborization and axon remodeling during dauer development. When dauer larvae are returned to favorable <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions,</b> <b>animals</b> resume reproductive development and IL 2 dendritic branches retract, leaving behind remnant branches in postdauer L 4 and adult animals. The C.  elegans furin homolog KPC- 1 is required for dauer IL 2 dendritic arborization and dauer-specific nictation behavior. KPC- 1 is also necessary for dendritic arborization of PVD and FLP sensory neurons. In mammals, furin is essential, ubiquitously expressed, and associated with numerous pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases. While broadly expressed in C.  elegans neurons and epithelia, KPC- 1 acts cell autonomously in IL 2 neurons to regulate dauer-specific dendritic arborization and nictation. ConclusionsNeuroplasticity of the C.  elegans IL 2 sensory neurons provides a paradigm to study stress-induced and reversible dendritic branching, and the role of environmental and developmental cues in this process. The newly discovered role of KPC- 1 in dendrite morphogenesis provides insight into the function of proprotein convertases in nervous system development...|$|R

To avoid these challenges, scientists typically use controlled laboratory environments to study animal-fluid interactions. However, it is reasonable to question whether one can extrapolate natural behavior (i. e., that which occurs in the field) from laboratory measurements. Therefore, in situ quantitative flow measurements are needed to accurately describe animal swimming in their natural environment. We designed a self-contained, portable device that operates independent of any connection to the surface, and can provide quantitative measurements of the flow field surrounding an animal. This apparatus, a self-contained underwater velocimetry apparatus (SCUVA), can be operated by a single scuba diver in depths up to 40 m. Due to the added complexity inherent of field conditions, additional considerations and preparation are required when compared to laboratory measurements. These considerations include, but are not limited to, operator motion, predicting position of swimming targets, available natural suspended particulate, and orientation of SCUVA relative to the flow of interest. The following protocol is intended to address these common field challenges and to maximize measurement success. ...|$|R

The present study, conducted in October 2013, was carried out in five hundred broiler chicks (Hubbard F 15 strain). The chicks were monitored from birth to the 52 nd day. These animals, with homogeneous weight of 93 g and mixed sexes, came from the same hatchery and underwent the same <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions.</b> <b>Animals</b> of the first lot, identified as “Control lot” received a food exempt from any additive but antibiotics added to water.

Here, we use RNA-mediated interference in C.  elegans to examine how knockdown of any gene affects the overall fitness of worm populations. Whereas previous studies typically assess phenotypes that are detectable by eye after a single generation, we monitored growth quantitatively over several generations. In contrast to previous estimates, we find that, in these multigeneration population assays, the majority of genes affect fitness, and this suggests that genetic networks are not robust to mutation. Our results demonstrate that, in a single <b>environmental</b> <b>condition,</b> most <b>animal</b> genes play essential roles.

40|$|Movement is an {{essential}} variable in animal ecology. It provides crucial information on individual and collective behavior and {{is the basis for}} efficient conservation planning of e. g. migratory species. To fully understand movement it is essential to consider the underlying <b>environmental</b> <b>conditions.</b> <b>Animal</b> movements are strongly influenced by the presence and distribution of resources. In this context, remote sensing has gained particular attention. Earth Observation (EO) data supports the monitoring of surface conditions providing a larger perspective on regional processes on multiple spatial and temporal scales. While remote sensing has been intensively used in the scope of movement ecology its application can be improved {{to take full advantage of}} the information acquired through EO. Existing applications focus on pixel based information aiming for the spatial and temporal matching of satellite and tracking data. However, this fails to provide an accurate description of the individual’s perception of space and of the interactive learning process that guides resource selection. Additionally, the direct integration of remote sensing data disregards the dynamic nature of the landscape. Spatial dissimilarities are often hidden when considering temporally invariant information. Selecting adequate spatial, temporal and thematic scales becomes thus essential. Following this premise this research will discuss the impact of scale on the analysis of animal space use and in the consequent understanding of resource selection. It will provide an assessment of the explanatory power of space use comparing the selection of different spatial, temporal and thematic resolutions. Movement data for a population of White Storks (cicogna cicogna) collected in the scope of the LifeTrack program is used as a reference for this analysis. Relevant remote sensing variables are derived from medium spatial resolution and high temporal resolution optical data as well as existing land cover information. Additionally, the integration of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) based information is also tested in the scope of this research. ...|$|R

We present the first large-scale study of IDPs in Arabidopsis thaliana, the most widely used model organism in plant biology, in order to get insight into the biological roles of these proteins in plants. The work includes a comparative analysis with the human proteome to highlight the differential use of disorder in both species.
