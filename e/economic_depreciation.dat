The substantial appreciation of the real exchange rate during the 1990 s was an important factor contributing to the economic crisis of 1998 - 2000. While a number of Colombian economists {{have argued that the}} real appreciation was an equilibrating response to real shocks, such as rising fiscal deficits, petroleum discoveries, and increased productivity, this paper argues that nominal variables (including the nominal exchange rate, monetary policy and capital flows) also played an important role.

So when it comes to sources of funding something, including the acquisition (creation) of fixed assets, only the working capital can be the source that’s why it is important to use them efficiently and the conditions of the limited resources.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{equilibrium}} real {{price of a}} fixed asset in a growing economy. The supply {{of this kind of}} assets is by assumption fixed. Land or unique works of art are probably their closest empirical counterparts. Economic growth is manifested by a systematic increase in the real price of services provided by the asset. The rate of growth of their price depends on price and income elasticities of the demand for the services. Given these elasticities, an equilibrium price of the asset can expressed using the present value model. The equilibrium real asset price increases in time in the same rate as the real price of the services. The asset price can be highly sensitive to changes in values of the permanent rate of economic growth and real interest rate. Transitory changes in economic growth, however, seem to have only minor effect on the equilibrium price. <b>depreciation,</b> <b>economic</b> growth, asset prices, present value model, real interest rates, price elasticities...|$|R

40|$|The {{tax holiday}} - an {{incentive}} frequently used {{in developing countries}} to encourage capital investments - offers benefits for short-term investments but could in fact penalize long-term capital investments. For some countries with high inflation rates and relatively fast writeoffs for depreciable capital, the effective tax rate on long-term investments is higher during the tax holiday than after. For one thing the tax law may require assets to be depreciated during the holiday. If so, the value of tax depreciation writeoffs may be lower than the true <b>economic</b> cost of <b>depreciation.</b> For another the tax benefit of nominal interest deductions associated with debt financing of capital are of no value to the firm during the holiday - whereas after the holiday they may be quite beneficial.

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} {{financial}} reporting of long-lived assets. The author's {{aim was to}} analyze the approach of two major accounting principles - IAS/IFRS and US GAAP. Both of the principles address following issues: * initial recognition and measurement, * depreciation: allocation of capitalized costs over the useful life of the asset, * disposal of the asset. Broadly accepted classification of the long-lived assets divides the whole group into two parts: tangibles and intangibles. General definitions and recognition criteria are covered by the framework. Particular standards dial then with special matters. Although both international approaches {{have a lot in}} common, several differences emerge: * US GAAP do not allow to capitalize internally developed intangibles,however developed intangibles can be capitalized under special conditions according to IAS/IFRS; * impairment: IAS/IFRS allow to cancel or adjust the impairment towards the original value of the asset, US GAAP - once impairment is recognized, it is not permitted to cancel it and to return back to the original value of the asset; * IS /IFRS use historical costs based treatment and allowed alternative treatment - revaluation, US GAAP don't use allowed alternative treatment of the assets - revaluation is not permitted; 138 * IAS/IFRS set the useful life of the intangibles up to 20 years, US GAAP don't restrict the useful life at all. In the process of convergence of IAS/FRS and USGAAPquestions have arisen which of the approaches should be taken as a crucial one for world accounting principles.

40|$|An {{unresolved}} question concerning stochastic depreciation shocks {{is whether}} {{they have to be}} unrealistically large to have any useful role in a dynamic general equilibrium model economy, as Ambler and Paquet (1994) first suggested. We first consider implied depreciation rates from sectoral data from the Bureau of <b>Economic</b> Analysis. These <b>depreciation</b> rates vary across time solely due to compositional changes within each sector. Hence, they tend to understate the range of fluctuation that would hold if the economic shelf life of capital varied endogenously as in Cooley et al. (1997). We find, however, that if depreciation rates follow a Markov switching process, a low variance of the depreciation rate is sufficient to allow a model economy to match the low correlation between hours worked and productivity observed in the data. White noise and autoregressive depreciation shocks, in contrast, require a counterfactually large variance in the depreciation rate to reduce the hours-productivity correlation. We also illustrate the level effects implied by nonlinear decision rules in simulations of dynamic general equilibrium models that include Markov switching parameters. Linear decision rules, in contrast, imply certainty equivalence and ignore the aversion that agents have to the skewed shock distributions that characterize Markov switching. ...|$|R
