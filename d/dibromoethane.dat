50|$|Frank's {{father was}} {{originally}} a miner seeking tin and copper {{in the hard}} rocks of the County. Subsequently he moved up {{to the position of}} engine man (driver), initially at a mine and later at Harvey's of Hayle. Harvey's was an internationally known pumping engine and other mine goods manufacturer in the 19th Century. After his initial schooling Frank became an apprentice at Holman's of Camborne, another internationally recognized company. He finished his 6-year apprenticeship in engineering on December 2, 1914. World War I changed the face of employment in UK at that time and Frank went to sea in the merchant marine as 4th engineer on the SS Trevalgan, one of the Hain line ships. After just one voyage he left the vessel on medical grounds. Thereafter he became employed in HM Dockyard, Devonport. In 1939 he decided to leave his safe employment at this large facility and become self-employed as an artist in hand beaten copper ware. Unfortunately, World War II intervened preventing him from carrying out his dream, instead he found himself employed in a new factory in Hayle producing <b>dibromoethane,</b> an additive used in petrol allowing higher compression ratios {{to be used in the}} most modern aircraft engines of the time - such as the Merlin. After the War he worked in Pool's of Hayle for a few years finally realizing his dream of full-time employment in copperware in the late 1940s. At this time Cornwall had a history of copperware, beginning with Newlyn Copper in the late 19th Century.

Our italian national case-control study was inserted within the INTERLYMPH consortium for the GWAS protocol and to examine new etiological hypothesis of NHL, studying the role of genetic polymorphisms (SNPs), occupational and personal factors such as diet, location of house, smoke. The study is ongoing. Methods 109 cases of lymphoma and 43 healthy controls were recruited in a research unit of Bari and Taranto within an, since 2007. Cases and controls were invited to blood sample drowning for serum measurement of xenobiotic and DNA analysis of SNPs and to administration of a questionnaire. In this phase we only produce a description of different subtypes of lymphoma recruited in our research unit and {{to carry out a}} preliminary assessment of the role of occupational factors using CAREX job exposure matrix, for the lack of haematic and genetics data Results The found subtypes of lymphoma, according the fifth level WHO 2008 classification, among blue collars, showed an higher proportion of NHL, mainly represented by Diffuse Large B- subtype (DLBCL) and Follicular lymphoma (FL). In the multivariate analysis an higher risk of lymphoma was reported among the blue collars [OR= 4, 06 (1, 03 - 15. 96) ].

40|$|Abstract only availableThe sigma receptors {{have been}} known to affect several {{physiological}} functions such as psychosis, depression and uncontrolled cell proliferation. But what makes the sigma receptors so great is the fact that they bind a variety of ligands. The phenylpiperazine and phenylpiperidine chemical classes of ligands have been identified to bind at sigma 1 receptor sites and a pharmacological model has been proposed. On the other hand, due to the scarcity of sigma 2 selective ligands, less is understood about this subtype. Non-invasive imaging of the sigma receptor in vivo would lead {{to a better understanding of}} the role that sigma receptors play in health and disease. Technetium- 99 m (Tc- 99 m) is the most commonly employed imaging radionuclide. This research project is focused on the preparation of a Tc- 99 m labeled complex designed to retain high affinity to the sigma 1 receptor subtype. The design of the ligand is based upon 1 -(3 ', 4 '-dimethoxyphenethyl) - 4 -(3 ''-phenylpropyl) piperazine (1), a sigma 1 agonist developed by Santen Pharmaceutical Co.

40|$|A {{characteristic}} {{feature of}} the class Theta glutathione S-transferase (GST) T 1 - 1 {{is its ability to}} activate dichloromethane and <b>dibromoethane</b> by catalysing the formation of mutagenic conjugates. The level of the GSTT 1 subunit within tissues is an important determinant of susceptibility to the carcinogenic effects of these dihaloalkanes. In the present study it is demonstrated that hepatic GST activity towards these compounds can be elevated significantly in female and male Fischer- 344 rats by feeding these animals on diets supplemented with cancer chemopreventive agents. Immunoblotting experiments showed that increased activity towards the dihaloalkanes is associated with elevated levels of the GSTT 1 subunit in rat liver. Sex-specific effects were observed in the induction of GSTT 1 protein. Amongst the chemopreventive agents tested, indole- 3 -carbinol proved to be the most potent inducer of hepatic GSTT 1 in male rats (6. 2 -fold), whereas coumarin was the most potent inducer of this subunit in the livers of female rats (3. 5 -fold). Phenobarbital showed significant induction of GSTT 1 only in male rat liver and had little effect in female rat liver. Western blotting showed that class Alpha, Mu and Pi GST subunits are not co-ordinately induced with GSTT 1, indicating that the expression of GSTT 1 is determined, at least in part, by mechanisms distinct from those that regulate levels of other transferases. The increase in amount of hepatic GSTT 1 protein was also reflected by an increase in the steady-state level of mRNA in response to treatment with chemopreventive agents and model inducers. Immunohistochemical detection of GSTT 1 in rat liver supported the Western blotting data, but showed, in addition to cytoplasmic staining, significant nuclear localization of the enzyme in hepatocytes from some treated animals, including those fed on an oltipraz containing diet. Significantly, the hepatic level of cytochrome P 450 2 E 1, an enzyme which offers a detoxification pathway for dihaloalkanes, was unchanged by the various inducing agents studied. It is concluded that the induction of GSTT 1 by dietary components and its localization within cells are important factors that should be considered when assessing the risk dihaloalkanes pose to human health...|$|E

40|$|Various {{chelating}} ligands {{have been}} designed and synthesised; these include amino-ainide ligands, tetraacetic acid systems and sulfur-containing amide ligands. Difficulties in the synthesis and purification ofthe amino-amide ligands were largely overcome, permitting the mono acylation of ethylenediamine and the synthesis ofbis(2 -aminoethyl) - 2 -benzylpropanediamide. Novel tetraacetic acid ligands, based on the propanediamide backbone and targeted as EDTA analogues, were obtained from their methyl and benzyl esters; but the instability ofthe tetraacids prevented their full characterisation. Bidentate, tridentate and tetradentate sulfur-containing monoamide ligands, based on the orthothio acetanilide moiety, were designed to specifically chelate platinum and palladium {{in the presence of}} base metals. In their synthesis, thiocyanation was used to introduce the orth-thio group on para-substituted anilines, and further functionalisation was achieved via appropriate protection of nucleophilic sulfur moieties. A range of tetradentate, sulfur-containing diamide ligands was also synthesised by reacting substituted 2 -mercaptoacetanilides with 1, 2 - <b>dibromoethane.</b> Novel ligands were characterised by spectroscopic ¹H and ¹³C NMR; IR and M S) techniques and elemental (combustion and high resolution MS) analysis. Computer modelling and ¹H NMR chemical shift data have been used to explore the conformational preferences of the sulfur-containing acetanilide ligands. The macrocyclic ligands and systems with ortho-methylthio substituents appear to exhibit the greatest degree of coplanarity ofthe aromatic and amide functions. Solvent extraction studies revealed that the sulfur-containing amide ligands selectively extracted palladium(II) from platinum(II), copper(II}, nickel(II} and cobalt(II}. Even though the palladium(II} was extracted from an acidic medium, certain monoamide ligands were able to complex palladium(II) through their sulfur and deprotonated amide nitrogen donors, a trithia mono amide ligand being observed to displace all the. chloride ligands on palladium to form a monomeric tetracoordinate complex. The diamide'ligands, however, appeared to favour extraction ofpalladium(II) by coordination through their sulfur donors, forming 5 -membered sulfur-sulfur chelates. In basic media (pH 8 - 9), selected sulfur-containing mO!l 9 apride and diamide ligands have been shown to complex platinum(II) and palladium(II) through their sulfur and deprotonated amide nitrogen donors. At neutral pH, a dimercapto mono amide ligand has been shown to complex platinum from cisplatin with partial expulsion of the ammine ligands, while a macro cyclic trithia mono amide ligand has been observed to complex platinum from tetrachloroplatinate with concomitant deprotonation of the amide nitrogen.

The photochemical products were detected with resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) as well as single photon VUV ionization at 118 nm. REMPI at 267 nm and 234 nm was used to detect the ground Br (P 3 / 2) and spin-orbit excited Br (2 P 1 / 2) atoms. Time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectroscopy and ion velocity imaging were also employed to study the formation and photodissociation of C 2 H 4 Br 2 + and C 3 H 7 Br+ ions that were observed in the TOF spectrum when the neutral species were irradiated with 118 nm and 355 nm lasers. The present {{results indicate that the}} thermodynamics data for the C 2 H 4 Br fragment may be lower than that reported in literature by 1. 8 kcal mol- 1. The ionization energy of C 2 H 4 Br was calculated as 7. 5 eV using a coupled cluster method, which confirms that C 2 H 4 Br+ must be formed from dissociative ionization of 1, 2 -DBE with 118 nm as opposed to neutral dissociation of 1, 2 -DBE. ^ 1 -bromopropane cations are produced via direct photoionization of C 3 H 7 Br by 118 nm light, which is generated by frequency tripling a 355 nm laser. The TOF-MS show many dissociation products, including C 3 H 7 +, C 3 H 5 +, C 2 H 3 +, and C 2 H 3 +. Although secondary dissociation of C 3 H 7 + produces C 3 H 5 + and C 2 H 3 +, photodissociation of C 3 H 7 Br+ with a 355 nm photon produces C 2 H 5 +. The major dissociation fragment from the 1 -bromopropane neutral studies was Br. The beta and translational energy distributions for Br and Br* in the 234 nm and 267 nm dissociation studies suggests that Br + is formed primarily via a parallel transition with 234 nm and 267 nm. The possible dissociation pathways and the angular and translational distributions for the brominated neutral and ion species are discussed in the dissertation. ...|$|E

It was then condensed with various aryl/alkyl acid chlorides to afford the corresponding 6, 8 -dimethoxy- 7 -methyl- 3 -aryl/alkylisochromen- 1 -ones (5 a-j). These isochromen- 1 -ones were hydrolysed to keto-acids (6 a-j) and then reduced to corresponding hydroxyacids, followed by cyclodehydration with acetic anhydride into corresponding 6, 8 -dimethoxy- 7 -methyl- 3 -aryl/alkyl- 3, 4 -dihydroisochromen- 1 -ones (7 a-j).

HBr, SIMes. HCl, SIMes. HPF 6 and SIMes. HBF 4. ### Introduction Azolium salts have become indispensable starting materials in N–heterocyclic carbene (NHC) chemistry. From being a laboratory curiosity, NHCs occupy now an important position in contemporary organometallic chemistry as powerful ligands for many catalytic reactions (ie: Negishi, Kumada–Tamao–Corriu, Sonogashira and Suzuki–Miyaura cross–coupling reaction, Buchwald–Hartwig amination, aerobic oxidation, CuAAC reaction …) as well as organocatalysts. Although diverse strategies {{have been developed to}} synthesize imidazolinium salts, they generally require the reduction of an intermediate diimine. This usually involves stoechiometric borohydride in a exothermic process which could present difficulties and hazards to scale–up. We report a simple gram scale synthesis of several imidazolinium salts (Br, Cl, PF 6 and BF 4). Through a direct double alkylation of 1, 2 –dibromethane, the corresponding diamine {{is obtained}} which serves as convenient starting material for the salts described above using convenient known procedures. ### Reagents 1. 2, 4, 6 -Trimethylaniline - 1, 2 –Dibromoethane - Methanol (technical) - Ethanol (technical and absolute) - Aqueous HBF 4 (60 %) - Aqueous HPF 6 (60 %) - Diethyl ether - Sodium carbonate - Acetyl chloride - Ethyl acetate - Anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 - Formic acid - Triethyl orthoformate ### Equipment 1. Round-bottomed flasks (250 mL, 500 mL and 1 L) - Teflon-coated stirring bars - Filtration funnels - Thermally controlled stirring plate - A distillation apparatus - A thermometer. - A separation funnel. ### Procedure **Synthesis of N,N’–bis–(2, 4, 6 –trimethylphenylamino) ethane dihydrobromide**. 1. Weigh out 40. 5 g (0. 3 mol) of 2, 4, 6 –trimethylaniline in a 250 mL round–bottomed flask equiped with a stirring bar. - Add 22. 5 g (0. 125 mol) of 1, 2 –dibromoethane. - Add 30 mL of methanol. - Stir the reaction mixture under reflux for 24 h. - PAUSEPOINT : a solid forms during the reaction, usually after 18 h. - The solution is cooled down to room temperature and stirred for an additional 2 h. - Filter off the formed brownish precipitate, wash it with 50 mL of methanol, 100 mL of ethyl acetate, 100 mL of diethyl ether and dry under an air flux for one hour to obtain a white powder. **Synthesis of N,N’–bis–(2, 4, 6 –trimethylphenylamino) ethane dihydrochloride**. 1. Weigh out 37. 8 g (82. 5 mmol) of N,N’–bis–(2, 4, 6 –trimethylphenylamino) ethane dihydrobromide in a 1 L round–bottomed flask. - Add 500 mL of diethyl ether and 25 g (235. 8 mmol) of solution of sodium carbonate in 200 mL water. - Stir vigorously the solution for 2 h. - Separate the organic layer, extract the aqueous phase with 100 mL of diethyl ether and dry the combined phases over anhydrous Na 2 SO 4. - Add 200 mL of ethanol in a 500 mL round–bottomed flask immerged in a water bath. - Add 19. 0 g (242 mmol) of acetyl chloride dropwise while maintaining the temperature close to room temperature. Then stir the solution for 30 minutes at room temperature. - Add the ethanolic HCl solution to the ether. - PAUSEPOINT : A white solid forms immediately. - Filter off the solid and dry it to constant weight in an oven (90 °C). ** 1, 3 –bis–(2, 4, 6 –trimethylphenyl) imidazolinium bromide or chloride** (1) 1. Weigh out 20. 0 g of N,N’–bis–(2, 4, 6 –trimethylphenylamino) ethane dihydrobromide (43. 7 mmol) or chloride (58. 3 mmol) in a two–necked 250 mL round–bottomed flask equipped with a distillation apparatus and a thermometer. - Add 150 mL of triethyl orthoformate and seven drops of formic acid. - Heat the white suspension until the internal temperature reaches 115 °C and maintain at this temperature for 30 minutes. - PAUSEPOINT : Ethanol is collected during the heating, as indicated by the temperature of vapors. During the heating, the white solid dissolves to re–precipitate only a few minutes later. - Cool down the reaction mixture to room temperature and wait for 2 h. - Filter the white powder, wash it with 2 × 100 mL of diethyl ether and dry under an air flux. **Synthesis of 1, 3 –bis–(2, 4, 6 –trimethylphenyl) imidazolinium tetrafluoroborate or hexafluorophosphate**. (2) 1. Weigh out 5. 0 g (13 mmol) of 1, 3 –bis–(2, 4, 6 –trimethylphenyl) imidazolinium bromide in a 100 mL round–bottomed flask. - Add 30 mL of ethanol. - Add 4. 0 mL of 60 % aqueous HBF 4 or HPF 6. - A white solid forms immediately. In the case of the tetrafluoroborate salt, 5 mL of ethanol are added. Stir the reaction in an ice bath for 45 minutes. - Filter the solid, wash it with 5 mL of cold ethanol and 5 mL of diethyl ether. - Dry the white solid in a desiccator under reduced pressure. ### Timing - N,N’–bis–(2, 4, 6 –trimethylphenylamino) ethane dihydrobromide: 30 h. - N,N’–bis–(2, 4, 6 –trimethylphenylamino) ethane dihydrochloride: 5 h. - 1, 3 –bis–(2, 4, 6 –trimethylphenyl) imidazolinium bromide (SIMes. HBr) : 4 h. - 1, 3 –bis–(2, 4, 6 –trimethylphenyl) imidazolinium chloride (SIMes. HCl) : 4 h - 1, 3 –bis–(2, 4, 6 –trimethylphenyl) imidazolinium tetrafluoroborate (SIMes. HBF 4) : 2 h. - 1, 3 –bis–(2, 4, 6 –trimethylphenyl) imidazolinium tetrafluoroborate (SIMes. HPF 6) : 2 h. ### Troubleshooting - The batch of N,N’–bis–(2, 4, 6 –trimethylphenylamino) ethane dihydrobromide might contain up to 7 % of 2, 4, 6 –trimethylaniline hydrobromide. - Solution: the batch was stirred for 10 minutes in boiling methanol; the solution was allowed to stand at room temperature overnight and filtered to afford pure diamine dihydrobromide as a white solid. ### Anticipated Results - Typical isolated yield N,N’–bis–(2, 4, 6 –trimethylphenylamino) ethane dihydrobromide should be 45 – 55 % (37. 8 g). - Typical isolated yield N,N’–bis–(2, 4, 6 –trimethylphenylamino) ethane dihydrochloride should be 93 % (28. 4 g). - Typical isolated yield for 1, 3 –bis–(2, 4, 6 –trimethylphenyl) imidazolinium bromide (SIMes. HBr) should be 95 – 99 % (16. 7 g). - Typical isolated yield for 1, 3 –bis–(2, 4, 6 –trimethylphenyl) imidazolinium chloride (SIMes. HCl) should be 93 – 99 % (18. 68 g). - Typical isolated yield for 1, 3 –bis–(2, 4, 6 –trimethylphenyl) imidazolinium tetrafluoroborate should be 97 % (4. 98 g). - Typical isolated yield for 1, 3 –bis–(2, 4, 6 –trimethylphenyl) imidazolinium hexafluorophosphate should be 95 % (5. 61 g). ### References 1.
