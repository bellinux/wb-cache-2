25|$|Recent {{research}} {{using data from}} the social bookmarking website Delicious, has shown that collaborative tagging systems exhibit a form of complex systems (or self-organizing) dynamics. Although there is no central controlled vocabulary to constrain the actions of individual users, the distributions of tags that describe different resources has been shown to converge over time to a stable power law distributions. Once such stable distributions form, examining the correlations between different tags can be used to construct simple <b>folksonomy</b> graphs, which can be efficiently partitioned to obtained a form of community or shared vocabularies. Such vocabularies {{can be seen as a}} form of collective intelligence, emerging from the decentralised actions of a community of users. The Wall-it Project is also an example of social bookmarking.|$|E

Nowadays, <b>folksonomies</b> {{are available for}} sharing almost any type of media, some examples include bookmarks 1, publications 2, images 3 and videos 4. Despite of the enormous size of <b>folksonomies</b> 5, resource retrieval in <b>folksonomies</b> is limited[5]. Currently its difficult to retrieve resources for uncommon queries (e. g. 1930 s, penny) or browse resources of a particular type (e. g. images of landmarks).

40|$|<b>Folksonomies</b> {{have emerged}} {{as a means to}} create order in a rapidly {{expanding}} information environment whose existing means to organize content have been strained. This paper examines <b>folksonomies</b> from an evolutionary perspective, viewing the changing conditions of the information environment as having given rise to organization adaptations in order to ensure information “survival” - remaining findable. This essay traces historical information organization mechanisms, the conditions that gave rise to <b>folksonomies,</b> and the scholarly response, review, and recommendations for the future of <b>folksonomies...</b>|$|R
40|$|As {{the number}} of tagged data on the Web is increased, there are many needs on the folksonomy-based systems to provide some proper functionalities, such as {{identifying}} user interests, recommending relevant resources or constructing ontologies for sharing and reusing tag data, etc. However, some proper data mining approaches to <b>folksonomies</b> are necessary to better understand their characteristics and extract valuable information from <b>folksonomies.</b> In this paper, we propose a triadic approach for mining <b>folksonomies</b> based on hierarchical classes analysis, and demonstrate how triadic elements of <b>folksonomies</b> can be analyzed and mined by applying the proposed approach. We also discuss how {{the results can be}} used for better understanding of the characteristics of <b>folksonomies.</b> Key words...|$|R
50|$|The {{study of}} the {{structuring}} or classification of <b>folksonomy</b> is termed folksontology. This branch of ontology deals with the intersection between highly structured taxonomies or hierarchies and loosely structured <b>folksonomy,</b> asking what best features can be taken by both for a system of classification. The strength of flat-tagging schemes is their ability to relate one item to others like it. <b>Folksonomy</b> allows large disparate groups of users to collaboratively label massive, dynamic information systems. The strength of taxonomies are their browsability: users can easily start from more generalized knowledge and target their queries towards more specific and detailed knowledge. <b>Folksonomy</b> looks to categorize tags and thus create browsable spaces of information {{that are easy to}} maintain and expand.|$|E
5000|$|Image sharing sites usually propose {{several ways}} to {{classify}} images. Most sites propose at least a taxonomy where images can be grouped within a directory-like structure in so-called [...] "galleries". Some sites also allow users to classify images using tags to build a <b>folksonomy.</b> Depending on the restrictions {{on the set of}} users allowed to tag a single document and the set of tags available to describe the document, one speaks about narrow and broad folksonomies. A <b>folksonomy</b> is broad when there is no restriction on the set of taggers and available tags. When there are limitations, the <b>folksonomy</b> is called narrow. Another mechanism is coupling taxonomy and <b>folksonomy,</b> where tags associated to galleries and artists are cascaded to the galleries and artist's pictures. Broad taxonomies have interesting properties like the power law.|$|E

More specifically, <b>folksonomies</b> may be {{implemented}} for social bookmarking, teacher resource repositories, e-learning systems, collaborative learning, collaborative research, and professional development.|$|R
50|$|Supporters of <b>folksonomies</b> {{claim that}} they are often {{preferable}} to taxonomies because <b>folksonomies</b> democratize the way information is organized, they are more useful to users because they reflect current {{ways of thinking about}} domains, and they express more information about domains. Critics claim that <b>folksonomies</b> are messy and thus harder to use, and can reflect transient trends that may misrepresent what is known about a field.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{can observe}} {{that the amount}} of non-toy domain ontologies is still very limited for many areas of interest. In contrast, <b>folksonomies</b> are widely in use for (1) tagging Web pages (e. g. del. icio. us), (2) annotating {{pictures}} (e. g. flickr), or (3) classifying scholarly publications (e. g. bibsonomy). However, such <b>folksonomies</b> cannot offer the expressivity of ontologies, and the respective tags often lack a context-independent and intersubjective definition of meaning. Also, <b>folksonomies</b> and other unsupervised vocabularies frequently suffer from inconsistencies and redundancies. In this paper, we argue that the social interaction manifested in <b>folksonomies</b> and in their usage should be exploited for building and maintaining ontologies. Then, we sketch a comprehensive approach for deriving ontologies from <b>folksonomies</b> by integrating multiple resources and techniques. In detail, we suggest combining (1) the statistical analysis of <b>folksonomies,</b> associated usage data, and their implicit social networks, (2) online lexical resources like dictionaries, Wordnet, Google and Wikipedia, (3) ontologies and Semantic Web resources, (4) ontology mapping and matching approaches, and (5) functionality that helps human actors in achieving and maintaining consensus over ontology element suggestions resulting from the preceding steps. 1...|$|R

50|$|Both {{bookmarks}} {{and publication}} entries can be tagged to help structure and re-find information. As the descriptive terms can be freely chosen, {{the assignment of}} tags from different users creates a spontaneous, uncontrolled vocabulary: a <b>folksonomy.</b> In BibSonomy, the <b>folksonomy</b> evolves from the participation of research groups, learning communities and individual users, organizing their information needs.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>folksonomy</b> is {{a system}} in which users apply public tags to online items, {{typically}} to aid them in re-finding those items. This can give rise to a classification system based on those tags and their frequencies, in contrast to a taxonomic classification specified by the owners of the content when it is published. This practice is also known as collaborative tagging, social classification, social indexing, and social tagging. However, these terms have slightly different meanings than <b>folksonomy.</b> <b>Folksonomy</b> was originally [...] "the result of personal free tagging of information ... for one's own retrieval". Social tagging is the application of tags in an open online environment where the tags of other users are available to others. Collaborative tagging (also known as group tagging) is tagging performed by a group of users. This type of <b>folksonomy</b> is commonly used in cooperative and collaborative projects such as research, content repositories, and social bookmarking.|$|E
40|$|Although {{many social}} tagging systems {{share a common}} {{tripartite}} graph structure, the collaborative processes that are generating these structures can differ significantly.

In the literature, this distinction {{has been described as}} a distinction between broad vs. narrow <b>folksonomies.</b> This paper sets out to explore navigational differences between broad and narrow <b>folksonomies</b> in social hypertextual systems. We study both kinds of <b>folksonomies</b> on a dataset provided by Mendeley- a collaborative platform where users can annotate and organize scientific articles with tags. Our experiments suggest that broad <b>folksonomies</b> are more useful for navigation, and that the collaborative processes that are generating <b>folksonomies</b> matter qualitatively.

40|$|Describing current, {{past and}} future landscapes for {{inventory}} and policy making purposes requires classifications capturing variation in, for example, land use and land cover. Typical land cover classifi- cations for such purposes result from a top-down process and rely on expert conceptualisations, and thus provide limited space for incorporating more widely held views of key landscape elements. In this paper we introduce the notion of spatial <b>folksonomies,</b> which we define as a tuple linking a vocabulary of landscape terms through authors and resources to locations. We demonstrate how spatial <b>folksonomies</b> can automatically be created for Switzerland using two text corpora: the Swiss Alpine Club's yearbook for the past 150 years and user generated content from a website describing {{a wide range of}} outdoor ac- tivities. The spatial <b>folksonomies</b> capture variation in space of the use of nouns describing 96 natural landscape terms (e. g. ridge, forest, mountain, etc.) and allow us to characterise regions and compute similarities. We compare our spatial <b>folksonomies</b> to two traditional land cover/land use classifications (CORINE and Arealstatistik) and demonstrate that despite their very different sources, the approaches capture landscape variation in broadly similar ways. However, our spatial <b>folksonomies</b> provide new insights into how landscapes are described, through for example variation in space, time and through the prism of different activities. We argue that our spatial <b>folksonomies</b> are a novel way of capturing vari- ation closer to the bottom-up understandings of landscape for instance required to describe cultural ecosystem services...|$|R
40|$|Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH), {{one of the}} {{standard}} descriptive languages used in library catalogs, are often criticized for their lack of currency, biased language, and atypical syndetic structure. Conversely, <b>folksonomies,</b> which rely on the natural language of their users, offer a flexibility often lacking in controlled vocabularies and as such may offer an alternative to or a means of augmenting more rigid controlled vocabularies such as LCSH. Content analysis studies have already demonstrated the potential for <b>folksonomies</b> {{to be used as}} a means of enhancing subject access to materials. Despite a sizable number of libraries now using the LibraryThing for Libraries catalog enhancements, and the development by some libraries of their own tagging systems (e. g., PennTags, MTagger), little research has been undertaken to determine the effectiveness of <b>folksonomies</b> as a means of enhancing item discovery in library catalogs. This project examines the utility of <b>folksonomies</b> as a means of enhancing subject access to materials in library OPACs through usability testing with the LibraryThing for Libraries catalog enhancements. Initial findings from the usability test indicate that while they cannot replace LCSH, <b>folksonomies</b> do show promise for aiding information seeking in OPACs. Overall, participants indicated that <b>folksonomies</b> could be useful for surveying broad subject areas or for exploring materials in a topic area with which the user is not familiar, while subject headings remained the preferred access mechanism for information seeking that is tied to more focused research. In the context of information systems design, the study revealed that while <b>folksonomies</b> have the potential to enhance subject access to materials, that potential is severely limited by the current inability of catalog interfaces to support tag-based searches alongside standard catalog searches. unpublishednot peer reviewe...|$|R
