50|$|It also is {{important}} for Smart Grid implementations that power line communication (PLC) technologies used within the home over a <b>Home</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Network</b> (HAN), are standardized and compatible. The HAN allows HVAC systems and other household appliances {{to communicate with the}} smart meter, and from there to the utility. Currently there are several broadband or narrowband standards in place, or being developed, that are not yet compatible. In order to address this issue, the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) established the PAP15 group, which will study and recommend coexistence mechanisms with a focus on the harmonization of PLC standards for the HAN. The objective of the group is to ensure that all PLC technologies selected for the HAN will coexist as a minimum. The two main broadband PLC technologies selected are the HomePlug AV / IEEE 1901 and ITU-T G.hn technologies. Technical working groups within these organizations are working to develop appropriate coexistence mechanisms. The HomePlug Powerline Alliance has developed a new standard for smart grid HAN communications called the HomePlug Green PHY specification. It is interoperable and coexistent with the widely deployed HomePlug AV technology and with the new IEEE 1901 global standard and is based on Broadband OFDM technology. ITU-T commissioned in 2010 a new project called G.hnem, to address the home networking aspects of energy management, built upon existing Low Frequency Narrowband OFDM technologies.|$|E

40|$|<b>Home</b> <b>area</b> <b>network</b> (HAN) {{management}} is problematic for ordinary home users. Lack of user expertise, potential complexity of administration tasks, extreme diversity of network devices, price pressures producing devices with minimal feature sets, and highly dynamic requirements of user applications {{are some of}} the main challenges in HANs. As networking becomes enabled in many more HAN devices, these problems are set to increase. A viable solution to address these challenges lies in various levels of automation in <b>Home</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Network</b> (HAN), and at a slightly deeper level of self-governance in general, now often termed as autonomic computing. HANs are good candidate for autonomic network management, such as policy-based network management (PBNM), to automate network managing tasks. However, a significant challenge here is the transformation of user requirements to a form that is understandable to the HAN system. Semantic computing enables a system interpreting semantics of instances at different levels of abstraction (e. g. concepts related to users and network) without requiring it to know the interlinks among different system concepts (e. g. how a user is linked to its networked devices and applications). The research work presented in this thesis proposes a framework for the implementation of user-driven, semantic-aware, policy-based HAN management.
