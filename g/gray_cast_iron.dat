40|$|The nodular <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> are {{characterized}} by high mechanical properties compared to <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> with lamellar graphite or vermiculargraphite. The ductile iron has already {{been the subject of}} many studies especially since the literature is rich on them, and sources of information are different. The fact is that the mechanical properties of nodular <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> (FGS) depend on the number of graphitegrains, their roundness, the solidification rate and nature of the matrix [3]. Many studies of nodular <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> showed that the morespherical particles of graphite, the higher the mechanical properties are high.

The building of the administration of the Dvigatel Revolyutsii was destroyed. In several places there was a panic. This contributed to the large number of refugees who filled the city (the Wehrmacht was already near Moscow), part of the population began to leave the urban areas. The plants stopped production, but the production of T-60 tanks on GAZ was still growing rapidly. The absence of antiaircraft guns allowed German aircraft to conduct sighting bombing from a low altitude. A total of 127 people died, 176 were injured severely, 195 were easily wounded (data vary in different sources). A large number of the deceased were refugees from Moscow, resettled in the Avtozavodsky City District. No German aircraft were shot down.|$|E
50|$|Most {{materials}} shrink as they solidify, but, as {{the adjacent}} table shows, a few materials do not, such as <b>gray</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron.</b> For the materials that do shrink upon solidification {{the type of}} shrinkage depends on how wide the freezing range is for the material. For materials with a narrow freezing range, less than 50 C, a cavity, known as a pipe, forms {{in the center of}} the casting, because the outer shell freezes first and progressively solidifies to the center. Pure and eutectic metals usually have narrow solidification ranges. These materials tend to form a skin in open air molds, therefore they are known as skin forming alloys. For materials with a wide freezing range, greater than 110 C, much more of the casting occupies the mushy or slushy zone (the temperature range between the solidus and the liquidus), which leads to small pockets of liquid trapped throughout and ultimately porosity. These castings tend to have poor ductility, toughness, and fatigue resistance. Moreover, for these types of materials to be fluid-tight a secondary operation is required to impregnate the casting with a lower melting point metal or resin.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} main disadvantages: high tooling cost, limited to low-melting-point metals, and short mold life. The high tooling costs make this process {{uneconomical}} for small production runs. When {{the process is}} used to cast steel or iron the mold life is extremely short. For lower melting point metals the mold life is longer but thermal fatigue and erosion usually limit the life to 10,000 to 120,000 cycles. The mold life is dependent on four factors: the mold material, the pouring temperature, the mold temperature, and the mold configuration. Molds made from <b>gray</b> <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> can be more economical to produce but have short mold lives. On the other hand, molds made from H13 tool steel may have a mold life several times greater. The pouring temperature {{is dependent on the}} casting metal, but the higher the pouring temperature the shorter the mold life. A high pouring temperature can also induce shrinkage problems and create longer cycle times. If the mold temperature is too low misruns are produced, but if the mold temperature is too high then the cycle time is prolonged and mold erosion is increased. Large differences in section thickness in the mold or casting can decrease mold life as well.|$|E

The engine is a {{modified}} version of the Ford Duratorq 3.2 L diesel engine that has been adapted to meet emissions in the United States. To aid in economy, emissions, and reduce NVH, it has a high pressure common rail fuel injection system and piezo injectors that can spray up to five different injections per compression event. It has a water cooled EGR system to reduce the temperature of the exhaust gas before being recirculated through the intake. A unique feature to the emissions system is that the diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) and the DPF have been combined into one singular unit as opposed to the traditional two separate units. Exhaust treatment continues with SCR which is done by the injection of diesel exhaust fluid in the exhaust to reduce NOx. The engine features a variable geometry turbo which allows for intake air flow tuning on the fly to increase power and fuel economy. The engine also features a variable-flow oil pump to avoid wasting mechanical energy pumping excessive amounts of oil.

40|$|<b>Cast</b> <b>iron</b> {{and steel}} alloys are {{commonly}} used for tooling and structural components in Al production, Al die-casting and the aluminizing industry due to their favourable properties including high strength, good formability and low cost. However, the iquid Al corrosion of these materials {{is one of the}} crucial concerns in maintaining the efficient production. Al is produced by the electrolytic smelting of alumina. <b>Cast</b> <b>iron</b> and/or <b>cast</b> steel pipes - commonly known as „tapping pipes‟ - are used to extract the liquid Al produced by smelting. Tapping pipes mainly degrade by material loss because liquid Al reacts with nearly all metals. Failure of tapping pipes is a significant contributor to the maintenance expenses; therefore, the primary aim of this research is to develop a material to enhance the life time of tapping pipes. Various test methods were developed in order to examine the effect of molten Al environment on <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> and steel alloys. The corrosion resistance of these alloys was determined under different conditions of Al flow and temperature. The intermetallic compounds formed by exposing the ferrous to liquid Al were characterized using the Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) and Electron Back Scatter Diffraction (EBSD) techniques. The formation, growth and nature of reaction products were revealed to establish a link to the liquid Al corrosion resistance. A relationship between the chemical composition and liquid Al corrosion resistance of <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> could not established in the past. In the present work, the corrosion rate was found to depend upon the graphite morphology and fraction of each Fe-C phase of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> matrix, which can be controlled by selecting the chemical composition. Moreover, present research suggested the guidelines for producing a <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> with enhanced liquid Al corrosion resistance. The presence of C-rich phases, graphite flakes and cementite was found to be effective in enhancing the liquid Al corrosion resistance of <b>gray</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons.</b> Conversely, a higher Si content was found to enhance the susceptibility of <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> to liquid Al corrosion. The corrosion mechanisms for ferrous alloys in liquid Al are not fully understood. Thus the subsequent analysis of the dissolution data was supported by investigating the reaction products formed between Al and substrate materials. In addition to commonly existent ε-Fe 2 Al 5 and ζ-FeAl 3 phases, the formation of Al 4 C 3 and κ-Fe 3 AlC compounds was confirmed {{for the first time in}} the intermetallic layers of ferrous alloys. The Fe 3 Si phase in the intermetallic layers of high Si <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> was found, which was believed to facilitate the high corrosion rates of high Si <b>cast</b> <b>irons.</b> Moreover, the mechanism by which C in Fe-substrates affects the liquid Al corrosion resistance can be better understood given the present work. Furthermore, the analysis presented here gives an understanding of the nature, growth and dissolution of intermetallic compounds in several <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> alloys. Higher Si additions to <b>cast</b> <b>irons</b> played an important role in molten metal corrosion by accelerating the material loss and changing the nature of intermetallic layers. The results of this study clearly indicated that the dissolution and the growth of intermetallic compounds are interrelated and the dissolution and/or spallation of the intermetallic layers may be the primary mode of liquid Al corrosion of ferrous alloys...|$|R

The neural network topology used is the multilayer perception, and the algorithm chosen for its training was the backpropagation. This solution was applied to 60 samples of <b>cast</b> <b>iron</b> images and results were {{very similar to the}} ones obtained by visual human tests. This was better than the information obtained from a commercial system that is very popular in this area. In fact, this solution segmented the images of microstructures materials more efficiently. Thus, we can conclude that it is a valid and adequate option for researchers, engineers, specialists and professionals from materials science field to realize a microstructure analysis from images faster and automatically...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The paper gives a {{comparison}} of various techniques of laser surface hardening for various kinds of structural and tool steels, and special maraging steel and hardening of nodular graphite and <b>gray</b> <b>cast</b> <b>irons.</b> Design/methodology/approach: Experimental investigations of laser surface transformation hardening, laser remelting and laser shock processing were performed. Trials of laser hardening were carried out under different conditions, with different modes of laser guidance over the specimen surfaces, and with different degrees of path overlapping. Different kinds of absorbents, were tested, the depths of hardened paths or layers were measured, profiles of hardness and residual stresses were measured, the microstructures formed were analysed, and a micro-chemical analysis was made. Findings: The investigations showed that under different laser-hardening conditions quite different surface-layer properties are obtained. A very strong connection of the chosen energy input, the type of absorbent used, the degree of overlapping, and the mode of laser-beam guidance with {{the depth of the}} hardened path or layer, and the through-depth profiles of microhardness and residual stresses of the hardened path or layer was found. Research limitations/implications: He industrial requirements for the achievement of appropriate properties of surface layers, with special regard to the hardened-layer depth, and appropriate variations of microhardness and residual stresses are more and more frequent. The residual-stress profiles should have high compressive stresses at the surface and a small gradient of the residual stresses in the subsurface of the hardened layer. In this way high fatigue resistance of a material can be ensured and occurrence and propagation of cracks prevented. These findings offer engineers new concepts in the improvement of surfaces of machine and tool parts. Practical implications: With the present findings constructors and experts in laser technology can essentially improve the quality and operating life of machine parts or tools. Originality/value: The research conducted on the influences of different modes of laser-beam guidance in terms of microstructure and variations of microstructure and residual stresses in the thin surface layer are original...|$|R
