In this paper, an acoustic feedback cancellation scheme using spectral subtraction is proposed. Acoustic <b>feedback</b> <b>signals</b> are continuously estimated by approximated Wiener filter and are subtracted from microphone input signal of hearing aids. Using cross-correlation between microphone input signal and receiver output signal, approximated Wiener filer estimates the path of acoustic feedback of hearing aids. Acoustic <b>feedback</b> <b>signals</b> are canceled by the spectrum of output of approximated Wiener filter. <b>Feedback</b> <b>signals</b> are hardly occurred because they are continuously estimated and canceled by the proposed scheme.

25|$|Aberrant B cell receptor-mediated {{feedback}} – A {{feature of}} human autoimmune disease {{is that it}} is largely restricted to a small group of antigens, several of which have known signaling roles in the immune response (DNA, C1q, IgGFc, Ro, Con. A receptor, Peanut agglutinin receptor(PNAR)). This fact gave rise to the idea that spontaneous autoimmunity may result when the binding of antibody to certain antigens leads to aberrant signals being fed back to parent B cells through membrane bound ligands. These ligands include B cell receptor (for antigen), IgG Fc receptors, CD21, which binds complement C3d, Toll-like receptors 9 and 7 (which can bind DNA and nucleoproteins) and PNAR. More indirect aberrant activation of B cells can also be envisaged with autoantibodies to acetyl choline receptor (on thymic myoid cells) and hormone and hormone binding proteins. Together with the concept of T-cell-B-cell discordance this idea forms the basis of the hypothesis of self-perpetuating autoreactive B cells. Autoreactive B cells in spontaneous autoimmunity are seen as surviving because of subversion both of the T cell help pathway and of the <b>feedback</b> <b>signal</b> through B cell receptor, thereby overcoming the negative signals responsible for B cell self-tolerance without necessarily requiring loss of T cell self-tolerance.|$|E

A composite control strategy is proposed in this paper, which uses both local and non-local feedback channels to achieve enhanced damping and improved robustness. Special local signals and their non-local equivalents are identified for series reactive and shunt real power injection devices, which facilitate the design of controllers with a simple structure and fewer parameters. Unlike modal speed signals, synthesis of these signals does not require an online eigen-solution. Case studies are presented which demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of this strategy...|$|R

At intermediate flow rates, several non-harmonically related frequencies occurred simultaneously suggesting that several corrugations were involved in the sound generation. In the smaller metal tube, a predominant tone appeared at 6174Hz and corresponded to n=2.

40|$|Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are {{triggered}} by an aberrant {{hematopoietic stem cell}} (HSC). It is, however, unclear how this clone interferes with physiologic blood formation. In this study, we followed {{the hypothesis that the}} MDS clone impinges on <b>feedback</b> <b>signals</b> for self-renewal and differentiation and thereby suppresses normal hematopoiesis. Based on the theory that the MDS clone affects <b>feedback</b> <b>signals</b> for self-renewal and differentiation and hence suppresses normal hematopoiesis, we have developed a mathematical model to simulate different modifications in MDS-initiating cells and systemic <b>feedback</b> <b>signals</b> during disease development. These simulations revealed that the disease initiating cells must have higher self-renewal rates than normal HSCs to outcompete normal hematopoiesis. We assumed that self-renewal is the default pathway of stem and progenitor cells which is down-regulated by an increasing number of primitive cells in the bone marrow niche – including the premature MDS cells. Furthermore, the proliferative signal is up-regulated by cytopenia. Overall, our model is compatible with clinically observed MDS development, even though a single mutation scenario is unlikely for real disease progression which is usually associated with complex clonal hierarchy.

Primary visual cortex (V 1) has small receptive fields and processes feedforward information at a fine-grained spatial scale, whereas higher visual areas have larger, spatially invariant receptive fields. Therefore, feedback could provide coarse {{information about the}} global scene structure or alternatively recover fine-grained structure by targeting small receptive fields in V 1. We tested if <b>feedback</b> <b>signals</b> generalise across different spatial frequencies of feedforward inputs, or if they are tuned to the spatial scale of the visual scene. Using a partial occlusion paradigm, {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) and multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) we investigated whether feedback to V 1 contains coarse or fine-grained information by manipulating the spatial frequency of the scene surround outside an occluded image portion. We show that feedback transmits both coarse and fine-grained information as it carries information about both low (LSF) and high spatial frequencies (HSF). Further, <b>feedback</b> <b>signals</b> containing LSF information are similar to <b>feedback</b> <b>signals</b> containing HSF information, even without a large overlap in spatial frequency bands of the HSF and LSF scenes. Lastly, we found that feedback carries similar information about the spatial frequency band across different scenes.
