Meanwhile, Blair feels disconcerted while dancing with Nate and ends their relationship {{by the end of}} the night. Blair explains to Serena that after completing high school with Nate, <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> simply a high school boyfriend.

25|$|Bobby (McCulloch) is {{a rebellious}} {{teenager}} whose love of rock'n'roll {{serves as the}} basis for most of his sketches. Bobby views rock as an expression of personal freedom, and always fights back when <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> he is being denied that freedom. He is frequently in conflict with his parents, played by McKinney (father) and Foley (mother). He has also taken on a sarcastic jazz-loving teacher (Foley), and once even faced off against the Devil himself (McKinney) in a guitar-playing contest. Despite his rebellious attitude toward authority, he emphatically enjoys the taste of his mother's ham steak. A pre- Nicole de Boer appeared in three sketches as Bobby's girlfriend Laura. He, like Bauer above are a tongue-in-cheek satire of the rebellious late-80/1990s Grunge/Generation X subculture.|$|E

25|$|The song's lyrics {{feature the}} phrase {{identity}} ga nai, umarenai, which leads {{the song and}} feature in the song's chorus. The song's protagonist says that going by measures such as what his favourite clothes, books and food are, he's just a regular person, and that him thinking about the morning's rain {{that led to a}} woman's shirt becoming set were inelegant thoughts. A scene is depicted in the lyrics where someone {{at the beginning of a}} concert compares himself with the other members of the audience, and realises that comparing yourself to others is not a proper way to live. Later, he thinks about childhood memories of defeat, and realises that these memories are his pure self. After understanding this, <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> he wants to scream, and begins to cry.|$|E
25|$|Introduced {{in chapter}} six, {{he prefers to}} be called Joseph, and is known also as the Wandering Jew, or the “Magician of the Flow”, he is a mysterious being {{that looks like a}} young boy, but is much older. A long time ago, people said that “God’s Son” cast an immortal curse on him. Holding no clear intention, he’s just a monster that simply does what <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like.</b> He seems to travel around the world experimenting with the living and dead {{for the sake of his}} experiments, {{although}} he has apparently forgotten why he experiments. He has the appearance of a human but the body of a non-human – as seen in chapter eleven when he was struck with a magic bullet. He dislikes his “Cartaphilius” name.|$|E

McNulty takes Bodie to Cylburn Arboretum. Bodie tells him {{that he is not}} an informant but admits his frustration with his life as a drug dealer and Marlo's leadership. He states that Marlo expects his people to stand behind him, yet he himself does not stand behind people who work for him. He tells McNulty that the game is rigged and that <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> a pawn on a chessboard, showing that some of D'Angelo Barksdale's teachings were not lost on him. He offers McNulty information to bring down Marlo, but openly tells McNulty that he will not give any information on any former Barksdale associate. McNulty, out of genuine respect, tells Bodie that he is a soldier.|$|E

500|$|In the 2016 MLS Cup Final against Seattle, held at BMO Field on 10 December, Giovinco's {{performance}} was largely stifled by Seattle's heavy and aggressive defending, despite initially creating an early goalscoring chance for Altidore; throughout the match, he was fouled {{a total of}} six times and had several shots blocked. A scoring opportunity came in the 48th minute, but his shot was skewed wide of the near post. He was eventually substituted for Tosaint Ricketts in the 103rd minute, due to an apparent injury, and consequently, despite being the club's main penalty kick taker, was not used in the resulting shoot-out, which Toronto lost 5–4, following a 0–0 draw after extra-time. Regarding Giovinco's surprising substitution, Toronto's coach, Greg Vanney, stated in the post-match press conference: [...] "He couldn't move. He looked at me. It's not like I take him off because I want to. I look at him and he gives me the sign that he can’t go any more and when <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> he can’t go, <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> he’s more of a liability to the group than anything. That’s the decision. It's not one that I generally want to make, but we had to." ...|$|E

[...] The Telegraph credited Partridge with influencing [...] "awkward" [...] sitcoms such as The Inbetweeners, Nighty Night and Peep Show, and wrote: [...] "Never has one actor so completely inhabited a sitcom character. We believe Partridge is real, from his side-parted hair down to his tasseled sports-casual loafers." [...] In 2014, Guardian writer Stuart Heritage described Partridge as [...] "one of the greatest and most beloved comic creations of the last few decades." ...|$|E

500|$|The 1–0 {{loss was}} Australia's first series defeat since the notorious Bodyline series twenty years earlier that had {{motivated}} Lindwall {{to take up}} fast bowling. Despite Australia's troubles, Lindwall maintained his high standards, taking 26 wickets {{at an average of}} only 18.84, as well as contributing two fifties for a total of 159 runs at 17.66. For the entire tour, he had taken 85 wickets at 16.40, only one less than in 1948. At 32 years of age, Lindwall still maintained his high pace, but had developed more subtleties and an inswinger. Fingleton, now a journalist said [...] "One wonders once more at Lindwall's amazing capacity to bowl this ball whenever <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> it".|$|E

Coghill elucidated: [...] "The lie that Tony has spun to Whitney is that as soon as she's 16 they'll run away together and start a new life. But Tony's the type of paedophile who preys on younger children. Whitney is beginning to pass her sell-by date with him. [...] <b>He</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> he's losing his little girl but needs to keep Whitney under his control and not speak out." [...] As Tony began to lose interest in Whitney, he started grooming her 14-year-old school-friend Lauren Branning. A show-insider commented that Tony had been getting away with abusing Whitney for years, but was escalating as one young girl was no longer enough to satisfy him.|$|E

500|$|Some vocalising by Lennon is faintly audible {{at the end}} of the song, {{picked up}} as leakage onto one of the drum {{microphones}} (close listening shows Lennon making other comments to Starr). In the [...] "Paul is Dead" [...] hoax these were taken to be Lennon saying [...] "I buried Paul." [...] In 1974, McCartney said, [...] "That wasn't 'I buried Paul' at all – that was John saying 'cranberry sauce' … That's John's humour … If you don't realise that John's apt to say cranberry sauce when <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> it, then you start to hear a funny little word there, and you think, 'Aha!'" [...] Shortly before his death in 1980, Lennon expressed dissatisfaction with the final version of the song, saying it was [...] "badly recorded" [...] and accusing McCartney of subconsciously sabotaging the recording.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the song}} is ostensibly about love and dependency, like many U2 songs, it also lends itself to {{religious}} interpretations. Listeners have heard an allusion to the Book of Job [...] and its tale of God serving as a lamp upon Job's head walking through the darkness. [...] Robyn Brothers suggests that ultraviolet light is [...] "a metaphor for a divine force both unseen {{to the naked eye}} and ultimately unknowable to the human intellect." [...] Conversely, Steve Stockman, author of Walk On: The Spiritual Journey Of U2, sees [...] "Ultraviolet" [...] as being about Bono's wife Ali Hewson, and [...] "how when <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> trash, she makes him clean," [...] but says {{there is good reason to}} interpret the song as being just as much about God. The song's title supports this view: indigo and violet rarely appear in song lyrics as frequently as other colours, while ultraviolet represents an unseen wavelength beyond the visible spectrum.|$|E
500|$|Chris Coghill {{was cast}} as Whitney's abuser Tony on 20 June 2008. Upon {{accepting}} the role, he commented: [...] "Shona doesn't act, or look, {{like a little}} child. Which helps." [...] He has added of their off-screen relationship: [...] "Shona's fantastic to work with. She's very natural, very instinctive and a natural actress. There isn't any uncomfortable feeling at all." [...] Having undergone a thorough characterisation session, Coghill began shooting on 30 June 2008, and first appeared on-screen on 12 September 2008. Coghill has explained that Tony began grooming Whitney {{as soon as he}} met Bianca, ingratiating himself so as to become the family's [...] "hero figure" [...] and [...] "saviour". Discussing his character's relationship with Whitney, Coghill explained that: [...] "The lie that Tony has spun to Whitney is that as soon as she's 16 they'll run away together and start a new life.

[...] <b>He</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> he's losing his little girl but needs to keep Whitney under his control and not speak out." [...] Coghill stated that: [...] "This is the most challenging role I have had to play. But I hope by EastEnders tackling the sensitive issue of child abuse it can raise awareness." [...] When asked how she felt about the abuse storyline, Palmer commented: [...] "It would be brilliant if it helped somebody. If one person out there who's been abused saw [...] {{go out of their way}} to make it easier on the victim – Whitney's evidence is given by video link – it will be worth it." ...|$|E

500|$|On 19 December 2011 it was {{announced}} that a future storyline would see Darren plan his wedding as a surprise to Nancy. It {{was announced}} that Darren would be tempted back into his gambling addiction. Series producer Emma Smithwick commented on the storyline explaining that because Darren was organising the wedding it was [...] "never going to be as smooth as if somebody else was organising it". She added that the wedding was a [...] "long time coming" [...] for the couple but there going to be [...] "a few obstacles in the way", some self-imposed and some caused by external forces. She added that the event would be in [...] "true Darren style". Dawson felt that {{at this point in the}} relationship Darren is [...] "besotted" [...] with Nancy. He explained that Darren feels Nancy is good for him but Darren almost feels undeserving of her. Dawson felt that Nancy was the love of Darren's life. Dawson commented that Darren had [...] "been through the mill" [...] but [...] "for once in his life, Darren is happy". Dawson put this down to Darren getting the Dog in the Pond back and his relationship with Nancy. On why Darren plans the wedding Dawson said: [...] "He wants to show Nancy how much he loves her and thinks a surprise wedding will do that". He explained that due to lack of funds Darren will [...] "have to call in a lot of favours but he hasn't got many friends". Dawson felt that Darren would have to see the idea through to the end, even if Darren would end up [...] "upside-down in mud". On how he felt the wedding would turn out Dawson said that [...] "it could be the tackiest thing ever" [...] but that it would be [...] "hilarious". On the wedding and Darren's feelings, Dawson said that his character is [...] "incredibly excited about it, especially after all the hard work and planning that he's been doing in secret for weeks and weeks". Dawson said that Darren feels like the wedding is [...] "going to be the most perfect day possible and he just can't wait to see the look on Nancy's face when she realises what he's been up to". Dawson went on to add that [...] "things don't go as he planned". Dawson said that he wants the wedding to go ahead, saying [...] "after all this it would be lovely to see them get married, but you never know with soaps. I think they can be happy together". Dawson felt that the pair are the [...] "perfect match and are incredibly sweet together. Darren brings out Nancy's fun side and she gives his life a bit of order". Dawson went on to say he feels the pair are [...] "destined to be the Jack and Vera of Hollyoaks!" [...] Nancy's mother, Margaret Hayton (Darryl Fishwick), arrives in the village. Fox said that Margaret believes Darren is [...] "not good enough for Nancy" [...] so begins trying to split the pair up. Fox said that Margaret tries to [...] "make Nancy doubt her relationship with Darren". Nancy witnesses Darren and Cindy in an embrace which Fox said confirms to Nancy that [...] "everything her mum is saying is true - that Darren doesn't love her and he has been having an affair". When questioned if the pair can get through their troubles Fox said: [...] "I hope so! Myself and Ash have had an awful lot of fun working together, so I'd love to see a 'happily ever after'. Well, as much as it can be happy in soapland!" [...] Fox felt that if Nancy were to discover Darren's plans for their wedding she would be [...] "horrified" [...] although she would [...] "see that he has good intentions". Fox later said that Nancy [...] "really wants to get married, have babies and be happy" [...] with Darren, although Nancy may not ready to be a mother [...] "just yet". [...] Darren and Nancy marry. Dawson explained that Darren felt [...] "relief" [...] that the wedding went ahead as he [...] "often worried that Nancy is too good for him". Dawson commented that he thinks [...] "the characters work well together and they challenge each other all the time. It's quite comical, even when they're arguing. In many ways, Darren is a typical man and Nancy is a typical woman". On how married life will affect the couple Dawson said: [...] "it will change them is by giving a bit of solidity to their relationship. It proves to both of them how much they mean to each other, so if anything, I think it will make them stronger". Explaining why Darren went ahead with planning the surprise wedding Dawson said: [...] "he's got the pub back, <b>he</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> he's learned all his lessons, and he's come full circle. This time around, Darren doesn't want to mess anything up and wants to get everything right. Now that they're married, having children is something that they'll look at in the future".|$|E
