5|$|Construction, {{such as the}} North-South Arterial Highway project, {{supports}} the public-sector job market. Although passenger and commercial traffic on the Erie Canal has declined greatly since the 19thcentury, the barge canal still allows <b>heavy</b> <b>cargo</b> to travel through Utica at low cost, bypassing the New York State Thruway and providing intermodal freight transport with the railroads.|$|E
5|$|Reinforcements {{arrived by}} glider around 04:00 (Mission Chicago and Mission Detroit), and 21:00 (Mission Keokuk and Mission Elmira), {{bringing}} additional troops and heavy equipment. Like the paratroopers, many landed {{far from their}} drop zones. Even those that landed on target experienced difficulty, with <b>heavy</b> <b>cargo</b> such as Jeeps shifting during landing, crashing through the wooden fuselage, {{and in some cases}} crushing personnel on board.|$|E
5|$|A Coast Guard {{detachment}} {{aboard the}} Fife confirmed {{that it was}} properly flying the U.S. flag. The Coast Guard was suspicious since the ship was low in the water, suggesting it was carrying <b>heavy</b> <b>cargo,</b> yet there were no cranes or other equipment that a legitimate fishing vessel {{would be expected to}} have. Instead there were several large shipping containers. Via radio, they asked the Joint Interagency Task Force West, a consortium of various federal law enforcement agencies, for permission to investigate further, since smugglers and drug traffickers were known to use that route.|$|E
25|$|The <b>heaviest</b> <b>cargo</b> ships {{may require}} {{more than a dozen}} mooring lines. Small vessels can {{generally}} be moored by four to six mooring lines.|$|R
50|$|A Piper Aztec {{has landed}} over 600 times at Tern Island. There are {{typically}} monthly flights to Honolulu for mail, but <b>heavier</b> <b>cargo</b> typically comes by water. An alternative is email, either by satellite phone or the island's broadband internet connection.|$|R
50|$|Thermal {{protection}} systems and atmospheric friction {{have been used}} historically to reduce most of the kinetic energy {{that needs to be}} lost prior to landing, with parachutes and, sometimes, a final bit of retropropulsion used in the final landing. High-altitude high-velocity retropropulsion is being researched for future transport flights landing <b>heavier</b> <b>cargos.</b>|$|R
5|$|The General Aircraft Limited GAL. 49 Hamilcar or Hamilcar Mark I {{was a large}} British {{military}} glider {{produced during}} the Second World War, {{which was designed to}} carry <b>heavy</b> <b>cargo,</b> such as the Tetrarch or M22 Locust light tank. When the British airborne establishment was formed in 1940 by the order of Prime Minister Winston Churchill it was decided to develop a large glider which would be able to transport heavy equipment in support of airborne troops. General Aircraft Limited were chosen in January 1941 to develop this glider, which they designated the GAL. 49 'Hamilcar'. It was designed to transport a single light tank or two Universal Carriers. A number of problems, which included vacillation by the War Office on the number of gliders that it wanted and poor management by GAL, led to delays in the production of the Hamilcar, and the first production glider was only assembled in mid-1943. These problems were only partially solved, and production of the glider continued to be slow, hampered by difficulties in finding suitable locations to store and construct the Hamilcars once their parts were produced. A total of 344 Hamilcars had been built when production ended in 1946.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships which}} sail the {{southern}} sea {{and south of}} it are like houses. When their sails are spread they are like great clouds in the sky. Their rudders are several tens of feet long. A single ship carries several hundred men, and has in the stores a year's supply of grain. Pigs are fed and wine fermented on board. There is no account of dead or living, no {{going back to the}} mainland when once the people have set forth upon the caerulean sea. At daybreak, when the gong sounds aboard the ship, the animals can drink their fill, and crew and passengers alike forget all dangers. To those on board everything is hidden and lost in space, mountains, landmarks, and the countries of foreigners. The shipmaster may say 'To make such and such a country, with a favourable wind, in so many days, we should sight such and such a mountain, (then) the ship must steer in such and such a direction'. But suddenly the wind may fall, and may not be strong enough to allow of the sighting of the mountain on the given day; in such a case, bearings may have to be changed. And the ship (on the other hand) may be carried far beyond (the landmark) and may lose its bearings. A gale may spring up, the ship may be blown hither and thither, it may meet with shoals or be driven upon hidden rocks, then it may be broken to the very roofs (of its deckhouses). A great ship with <b>heavy</b> <b>cargo</b> has nothing to fear from the high seas, but rather in shallow water it will come to grief.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the regular cargo services described above, Bradley is occasionally visited by Antonov An-124 aircraft operated by Volga-Dnepr Airlines, and Antonov Airlines, transporting <b>heavy</b> <b>cargo,</b> such as Sikorsky helicopters or Pratt & Whitney engines internationally.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} large vessels are usually {{referred}} to as boats. Submarines are a prime example. [...] Other types of large vessel which are traditionally called boats are Great Lakes freighters, riverboats, and ferryboats. Though large enough to carry their own boats and <b>heavy</b> <b>cargoes,</b> these vessels are designed for operation on inland or protected coastal waters.|$|R
50|$|The {{village had}} an {{agricultural}} and fishing economy until {{the opening of}} local ironstone workings in 1848 initiated an industrialisation boom. A railway was built by 1865, and iron smelting began in 1874. A jetty on the coast built in 1880 allowed seagoing vessels to carry <b>heavy</b> <b>cargoes</b> from the area. Mining continued until 1958 and primary iron production until the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|Cargo gear: 8 cargo {{derricks}} (2 {{for each}} cargo corpartment) and 2 <b>heavy</b> lift <b>cargo</b> derricks.|$|R
25|$|The {{company began}} {{operations}} with {{a fleet of}} four An-124-100s and three Antonov An-12s, but a need for aircraft larger than the An-124 became apparent in the late 1990s. In response, the original An-225 was re-engined, modified for <b>heavy</b> <b>cargo</b> transport, and placed back in service under the management of Antonov Airlines.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} {{excavations}} in 1982 {{almost all}} of the wreck had been uncovered, revealing a ship with a concavely profiled bow and a convex stern; a sharp, prominent keel; two masts; and a <b>heavy</b> <b>cargo</b> load, a shape well attested by iconography but not common in the Roman world.|$|E
25|$|The ship carried 24 stone anchors. The {{stone is}} {{of a type}} almost {{completely}} unknown in the Aegean, but is often built into the temples of Syria-Palestine and on Cyprus. Brushwood and sticks served as dunnage to help protect the ship’s planks from the metal ingots and other <b>heavy</b> <b>cargo.</b>|$|E
50|$|From 1905 the {{steamship}} has transported goods, post, {{people and}} lumber. Since {{there are still}} no road connection to some houses, the boat is still important for many inhabitants. While the main income in the past was the freight of lumber and <b>heavy</b> <b>cargoes</b> the boat today is mainly used as a ferry, to transport the many tourists seeking the national parks to go hiking.|$|R
40|$|Coastal {{shipping}} is {{an important}} component of the national transport task, carrying mostly <b>heavy</b> <b>cargoes</b> over long distances. But, as Richard Webb shows in this report, coastal shipping 2 ̆ 7 s share of the domestic transport task has fallen from around 40 to 28 per cent (measured in tonne kilometres) over the past 15 years, the number of Australian-registered vessels is declining, and the fleet is ageing...|$|R
50|$|The bulk of {{the canal}} system {{was built in the}} {{industrial}} Midlands and the north of England, where navigable rivers most needed extending and connecting, and <b>heavy</b> <b>cargoes</b> of manufactured goods, raw materials or coal most needed carrying. Most of the traffic on the canal network was internal. However, the network linked with coastal port cities such as London, Liverpool, and Bristol, where cargo could be exchanged with seagoing ships for import and export.|$|R
25|$|On {{approach}} to the Banda Aceh airport, a <b>heavy</b> <b>cargo</b> plane hit a water buffalo which had strayed onto the runway on 4 January 2005. The {{left side of the}} plane's undercarriage collapsed, making the plane un-movable blocking the runway for a big part of that day, except for helicopters, until some specialists came from Singapore to put a temporary support under that part of the plane, and men moved the plane off the runway.|$|E
25|$|The airline was {{established}} in 1955 and based at the water aerodrome at Sørneset. Its fleet consisted entirely of seaplanes until 1966, when the first helicopter, a Bell 204, was delivered. The airline expanded through two joint ventures into Bergen Airport, Flesland from 1974. <b>Heavy</b> <b>cargo</b> operations became important in the 1980s, when the airline participated in two major hydroelectric power station projects. The only scheduled flights were between Ålesund and Aberdeen for a year starting in 1986.|$|E
25|$|Per the Vision for Space Exploration, the Space Shuttle was {{retired in}} 2011 due mainly to its {{old age and}} high cost of the program {{reaching}} over a billion dollars per flight. The Shuttle's human transport role is {{to be replaced by}} the partially reusable Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) no later than 2021. The Shuttle's <b>heavy</b> <b>cargo</b> transport role is to be replaced by expendable rockets such as the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) or a Shuttle Derived Launch Vehicle.|$|E
50|$|SRZ, LLC {{provides}} the transshipment of the oversized and <b>heavy</b> <b>cargos</b> using the developed infrastructure of rail roads and berth lines, its own diesel shunters, cranes, necessary technological equipment. The enterprise has 8 berths (1.24 kilometers of total length) equipped with gantry cranes with a capacity from 5 to 40 tons. Total area for cargos accumulation {{is more than}} 21 thousand square meters. The depth of the water near the berths is 8 meters.|$|R
5000|$|Echo ran between Portland and Eugene, Oregon, a city which until 1853 {{bore the}} name [...] "Skinner's Mudhole". [...] By April 1869 Echo was {{running on the}} Willamette between Eugene and Springfield, {{carrying}} as much as 101 tons of freight, which up to then was the <b>heaviest</b> <b>cargo</b> ever embarked from Eugene. [...] For a short time Echo, running above Willamette Falls, ran {{in conjunction with the}} steamer U.S. Grant, running below the falls.|$|R
50|$|Stearman Aircraft {{developed}} the Model 4 from the C3, adding a deeper fuselage and offering {{a range of}} more powerful engines. These features enabled the Model 4 to carry <b>heavier</b> <b>cargo</b> loads. Being larger than the C3, but smaller than the M-2 and LT-1 models, it filled {{a gap in the}} Stearman product line. Designer Lloyd Stearman said that it was the best airplane he ever designed. Heaters were provided for both cockpits.|$|R
25|$|The {{documentary}} {{evidence for the}} construction of ancient galleys is fragmentary, particularly in pre-Roman times. Plans and schematics in the modern sense did not exist until the 17th century and nothing like them has survived from ancient times. How galleys were constructed has therefore been a matter of looking at circumstantial evidence in literature, art, coinage and monuments that include ships, some of them actually in natural size. Since the war galleys floated even with a ruptured hull and virtually never had any ballast or <b>heavy</b> <b>cargo</b> that could sink them, not a single wreckage of one has so far been found. The only exception has been a partial wreckage of a small Punic liburnian from the Roman era, the Marsala Ship.|$|E
25|$|An unusual {{feature of}} the {{aircraft}} is the large cargo door, which is fitted as standard on all aircraft. According to Pilatus, the PC-24 is the first business jet to be fitted with this standard pallet-sized cargo door. The cargo door provides {{direct access to the}} heated and fully pressurized luggage compartment. This feature is useful for air medical services, utility and special mission operators. The door and baggage compartment are both capable of accepting a standard pallet; the compartment itself is deliberately located close to the aircraft's center of gravity to minimize the impact of <b>heavy</b> <b>cargo.</b> The trailing edge of the wing is reinforced against instances of incidental damage during loading/unloading. The design was optimized for special missions and by government customers.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the India-China airlift {{was flown}} with the Douglas DC-3 and its {{military}} versions, the C-47, C-53 and C-39. However, the DC-3 design's fuselage {{was so high}} off the ground that loading from most truck beds was difficult, and its narrow door and weak floor could not sustain <b>heavy</b> <b>cargo.</b> Although C-47s had reinforced flooring and a wider door, they still required specialized loading equipment {{for much of the}} cargo needed in China and had a limited payload capacity. Also, performance specifications of the Douglas transports were not suited to high-altitude operation with heavy payloads, and could not normally reach an altitude sufficient to clear the mountainous terrain, forcing the planes to attempt a highly dangerous route through the maze-like Himalayan passes.|$|E
5000|$|The dyeing {{property}} of sumac {{needed to be}} considered when it was shipped as a fine floury substance in sacks as a light <b>cargo</b> accompanying <b>heavy</b> <b>cargoes</b> such as marble. Sumac was [...] "especially dangerous" [...] to marble. [...] "When sumac dust settles on white marble, the result is not immediately apparent; but if it once becomes wet, or even damp, it becomes a powerful purple dye, which penetrates the marble to an extraordinary depth." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Jupiter-246 {{would use}} four Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) {{in the common}} core stage and would include a planned upper stage, informally called the Jupiter Upper Stage (JUS). The Jupiter-246 would use six RL10B-2 engines on the upper stage. [...] "246" [...] stands for two {{cryogenic}} stages, four main engines, and six upper stage engines. The primary role for the Jupiter-246 would be to launch <b>heavier</b> <b>cargo</b> as well as crew and cargo for lunar missions.|$|R
50|$|Ibn Batutta's travel account {{suggests}} that he also saw elephants in the land ruled by Urduja. Elephants can still be found in Borneo, {{and may have been}} gifts or traded in Pangasinan in earlier times. Ancient Malayo-Polynesian sailing vessels (such as the Balangay), like the ones used by the ancient Bugis and those depicted in the Borobudur bas-reliefs, were capable of transporting <b>heavy</b> <b>cargoes,</b> including elephants. There are depictions of such ancient ships in maritime Southeast Asia transporting several elephants for trade.|$|R
25|$|A {{multipurpose}} {{general cargo}} ship, the vessel {{was capable of}} carrying {{a wide variety of}} cargo ranging from general and dry bulk cargoes to containers, <b>heavy</b> <b>cargo,</b> long goods and trailers. The ship had five holds fitted with tweendecks, four forwards and one abaft of the superstructure. The ship, designed to serve the remote arctic regions, was also equipped with flexible winterized cargo handling equipment for loading and unloading in undeveloped ports. For loading and unloading of general cargo, containers and bulk cargo the ship was geared with four deck cranes located on the centerline, one on the aft deck and three forwards of the superstructure. On the continuous tweendeck the ship could also carry roll-on/roll-off cargo which was loaded and unloaded via a stern quarter ramp that could also be lowered directly on ice.|$|E
25|$|The {{ports of}} Veracruz are Tuxpan, Veracruz, Coatzacoalcos, Pajaritos, Minatitlán-Nanchital, Tecolutla, Nautla, Alvarado and Tlacotalpan. The first three are the ports for <b>heavy</b> <b>cargo</b> ships, with Veracruz the most {{important}} of the three. The others are small ports for small ships, fishing boats and tourism. All ports are operated privately with the exception of Pajaritos, which is operated by PEMEX. Port traffic in Veracruz account for 10% of all commercial traffic in the country, 23.4% of the port traffic of Mexico and 21% of all port traffic in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean. Goods imported through the state reach 16 out of Mexico’s 31 states plus Mexico City. The port of Veracruz alone handles over 12 million tons of freight per year. Coatzacoalcos is important for its handling of petroleum products.|$|E
25|$|This design, {{and that}} of its near {{relative}} the trunk deck ship, were said to maximize strength, allowing larger vessels and reduced the amount of steel needed for construction. In reality, {{it is more likely}} that the geometry inhibited the development of cracks in the sheer strake but vessels to this design were not any lighter than conventional vessels due to their unique geometry. In operation their hull form promoted self-trimming of homogenous cargo and inhibited shifting. The design also called for a cellular double bottom, which was the probable reason for claims of the type's exceptional hull strength, but it also raised the centre of gravity of the cargo. A higher centre of gravity increased the roll period and reduced the violence of rolls. But loading <b>heavy</b> <b>cargo</b> too high, and failing to properly ballast the bottom tanks, raised the centre of gravity and led to instability. This led to accidents, a Board of Trade investigation, and cautions from Doxford on proper loading. The design also was inconvenient, as the narrowness of the turret made for smaller cargo hatches and restricted habitation spaces in the superstructure atop the turret.|$|E
50|$|A runway {{extension}} to 2500 m (8202 ft) {{has been proposed}} {{for the past couple}} of years, however no viable financial solution has been found. The extension would allow <b>heavier</b> <b>cargo</b> aircraft to operate, making better use of the cargo terminal's capabilities.Recent projects have taken into consideration the conversion of an unused part of the cargo terminal into a passenger departures terminal to attract more airlines to the airport. A passenger terminal extension or overhaul is deemed absolutely necessary for the development of the airport.|$|R
50|$|Cotton cloth {{started to}} become highly sought-after for the European urban markets during the Renaissance and the Enlightenment. Vasco da Gama (d. 1524), a Portuguese explorer, opened Asian sea trade, which {{replaced}} caravans and allowed for <b>heavier</b> <b>cargo.</b> Indian craftspeople had long protected {{the secret of}} how to create colourful patterns. However, some converted to Christianity and their secret was revealed by a French Catholic priest, Father Coeurdoux (1691-1779). He revealed {{the process of creating}} the fabrics in France, which assisted the European textile industry.|$|R
50|$|After two {{or three}} months, the homeward voyage began. This was far more {{dangerous}} than the outgoing voyage, as the lahara season produces heavy seas {{and the risk of}} severe storms. The lagatoi themselves were burdened by a far <b>heavier</b> <b>cargo,</b> not to mention extra hulls, that enabled more sago to be carried, but did little for the seaworthiness or handiness of the canoes. It was an anxious time for the wives of the lagatoi crews as they faithfully followed the ritual started by Edai’s wife to ensure a safe return.|$|R
