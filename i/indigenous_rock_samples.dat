40|$|AbstractAcoustic {{laboratory}} measurements {{have been}} conducted for forty-two sandstone samples at fully air and water saturation. This study {{is an attempt to}} learn more about the behavior of both P-wave and S-wave velocity in porous sandstone <b>rock</b> <b>samples</b> for both dry and wet conditions. The statistical analysis indicates that higher values of the P-wave velocity are obtained for saturated samples and lower values are obtained for dry samples. The average P-wave velocity of dry <b>rock</b> <b>samples</b> is 2766 m/s and the average P-wave velocity of wet <b>rock</b> <b>samples</b> is 2950 m/s. The S-wave velocity is higher in the dry state with an average value of 1585 m/s. The average S-wave velocity of wet <b>rock</b> <b>samples</b> is 1357 m/s. The derived equations can be used for the prediction of P-wave velocity of wet <b>rock</b> <b>samples</b> from the P-wave velocity of dry <b>rock</b> <b>samples,</b> and the S-wave velocity of wet <b>rock</b> <b>samples</b> can be predicted from the S-wave velocity of dry <b>rock</b> <b>samples.</b> A strong linear correlation between P-wave velocity and S-wave velocity of dry <b>rock</b> <b>samples</b> and between P-wave velocity and S-wave velocity of wet <b>rock</b> <b>samples</b> was found. The resulting linear equations can be used for the estimation of S-wave velocity from the P-wave velocity in the case of both dry and wet <b>rock</b> <b>samples...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{multi-step}} steady-state (MSSS) {{method is}} proposed {{here for the}} measurement of low permeability. This new method can accurately and easily measure very low permeabilities of <b>rock</b> <b>samples</b> using a new setup, where the targeted <b>rock</b> <b>sample</b> and ordinary apparatus components are connected with a reference <b>rock</b> <b>sample</b> to form a series circuit. Any conventional <b>rock</b> <b>sample</b> with high permeability {{could be used as}} a reference <b>rock</b> <b>sample</b> such that the traditional steady-state measurement is feasible to accurately determine its permeability to be used as a reference value in the MSSS method. The challenging measurement of tiny mass flux rate by advanced pump system is avoided and the permeability of targeted <b>rock</b> <b>sample</b> can be directly computed using the pressure drops, sectional areas and lengths of the two connected <b>rock</b> <b>samples,</b> and the known permeability of the reference <b>rock</b> <b>sample</b> based on the mass conservation principle in a series circuit at steady state. Multi-step measurements using additional reference <b>rock</b> <b>samples</b> will be needed if the pressure drop over the first reference <b>rock</b> <b>sample</b> is too small to be accurately measured due to high permeability ratio when it is connected with the targeted <b>rock</b> <b>sample</b> to form a series circuit. The relative pressure drops can be small since the measurement of flow speed is unnecessary, which improves the accuracy in studying the dependence of gas permeability on the pore pressure. Consequently, the advantages of the MSSS method include low expense, simplicity, high accuracy and efficiency...|$|R

40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{minerals}} are stable is the Earth’s crust. Minerals belong {{to one of the}} seven crystal systems and have a {{wide range of}} densities. Hence, evaluating crustal seismic anisotropy is very complicated. Seismic anisotropy does not only depend on the types of minerals present, but rather considers mineral orientation, which is greatly dependent on the presence of Lattice Preferred Orientation (LPO), within a rock body. This study aims to investigate mineralogical role in rocks’ anisotropy and anisotropy symmetry. Hence, over 100 elastic tensors of crustal rocks was compiled from published studies from all over the world, along with the composition, pressure and temperature conditions of the <b>rock</b> <b>samples.</b> These compiled <b>rock</b> <b>samples</b> are representative of the rock types seen in the lower crust. The elastic tensors were decomposed into different symmetry classes and ηK was calculated for each <b>rock</b> <b>sample.</b> ηK measures the deviation from a perfectly elliptical hexagonal phase velocity. The total rock anisotropy of these samples ranges from 1. 27 % to 25. 47 %. Some <b>rock</b> <b>samples</b> dominantly have hexagonal symmetry, while others have orthorhombic and lower symmetry class. Higher amounts of mica in <b>rock</b> <b>samples</b> correlate to a higher hexagonal component of anisotropy. Similarly, <b>rock</b> <b>samples</b> with higher amphibole content tends to have a higher orthorhombic component of anisotropy. It is also shown that <b>rock</b> <b>samples</b> with higher anisotropy have lower ηK value, majority of which are below 1. These trends will be useful in forward modelling studies involving crustal anisotropy...|$|R

40|$|Acid {{fracturing}} {{is a well}} stimulation strategy {{designed to}} increase the productivity of a producing well. The parameters of acid fracturing {{and the effects of}} acid interaction on specific <b>rock</b> <b>samples</b> can be studied experimentally. Acid injection data and fracture conductivity measurements obtained in the research presented in this thesis yielded results that qualified and quantified the impact of a specific acid system on <b>rock</b> <b>samples</b> of varying acid solubility. Six <b>rock</b> <b>samples</b> from a carbonate reservoir were labeled A through F to protect proprietary information included in this research. A 2 % potassium chloride solution was used for the acid system and fracture conductivity measurements to prevent clay swelling. Injection temperature, contact time, and injection rate were designed to simulate field treatment conditions. The effects of a chelating agent on fracture conductivity were also studied. Before and after images of the <b>rock</b> <b>samples</b> indicated that the effect of 15 % hydrochloric acid on the samples was limited but correlated with the <b>rock</b> acid solubility. <b>Samples</b> E and F had a greater value of acid solubility and showed noticeable surface etching. Samples A, B, and C had lower values of acid solubility and did not show signs of surface etching. Sample D was of moderate acid solubility and showed minimal signs of surface etching. Fracture conductivity did not correlate directly with acid solubility, but likely was a function of inherent matrix permeability based on leak-off measurements and fracture conductivity measurements. Finally, the fracture conductivity of Sample D increased after exposure to a chelating agent. Commonly, acid fracture experimental studies are carried out with outcrop <b>rock</b> <b>samples.</b> The samples have more homogenous properties and without hydrocarbon content. In this study, cores from downhole formation were used. The original condition was preserved as much as possible to simulate real field situations. However, using field <b>rock</b> <b>samples</b> does present challenges not generally associated with outcrop <b>rock</b> <b>samples.</b> Based on the information gathered from the work presented in this thesis, conclusions were drawn concerning the effectiveness of a 15 % hydrochloric acid treatment in this formation and the challenges of using field <b>rock</b> <b>samples...</b>|$|R
