50|$|<b>Homosalate</b> is {{an organic}} {{compound}} {{used in some}} sunscreens. It is an ester formed from salicylic acid and 3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexanol, a derivative of cyclohexanol. Contained in 45% of U.S. sunscreens, it {{is used as a}} chemical UV filter. The salicylic acid portion of the molecule absorbs ultraviolet rays with a wavelength from 295 nm to 315 nm, protecting the skin from sun damage. The hydrophobic cyclohexanol portion provides greasiness that prevents it from dissolving in water.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of saffron as a natural sunscreen and moisturizer. The pollens of the saffron were dried and powdered in a grinder. The experimental formulations included a <b>homosalate</b> (8 %) lotion reference, lotions with 2, 4 and 8 % of grinded saffron, and the control lotion base without saffron. The lotions containing saffron were prepared like <b>homosalate</b> lotion reference according to FDA. The sun protection factors (SPFs) of the formulations were determined by an in vitro spectrophotometry method. The moisture contents of the skin before application and after 30 min and 3, 5 and 7 h post-application of the formulations were measured in human volunteers using Corneometer. The results indicated that, there was no significant difference between the SPF values of the 4 % saffron lotion and the <b>homosalate</b> lotion reference. However, the SPF of 8 % saffron lotion was significantly more than that of <b>homosalate</b> lotion reference. These results showed that in equal concentrations saffron lotion could act as a better antisolar agent compared to <b>homosalate.</b> Furthermore, there were no significant differences in skin moisture saffron lotions and the control lotion without saffron during the 7 h post-application period. Saffron can be used as a natural UV absorbing agent. The 4 % saffron lotion showed an SPF value equivalent to the 8 % <b>homosalate</b> lotion reference by an in vitro method. There were no significant differences of skin moisture contents after application of the saffron lotions and the control base lotion without saffron...|$|E
40|$|Objective(s) The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to prepare, characterize and evaluate the nanoliposomes containing safranal as a natural sunscreen and moisturizer factor. Materials and Methods The experimental formulations included <b>homosalate</b> reference, nanoliposomes containing 0. 25, 0. 5, 1, 2, 4 and 8 % safranal and empty liposomes. The liposomes were prepared using fusion method and homogenization. <b>Homosalate</b> reference was prepared according to FDA standard. Sun protection factors (SPF) of the formulations were determined by two in vitro methods; diluted solution transmittance method and transpore tape method. Studies of in vitro penetration of the formulations across mouse skin were carried out with diffusion cells. The percentage of safranal penetrated and retained in the skin was determined for the formulations up to 24 hr. The amount of the moisture contents of the skin before application and after 30 -minute, 1, 3 and 5 hr post-application of the formulations were measured in human volunteers using Corneometer.

40|$|An {{important}} part of assessing the toxic potential of nanoparticles for specific applications should be the direct comparison of biological activities with those of alternative materials for the same application. Nanoparticulate inorganic ultraviolet (UV) filters, such as zinc oxide (ZnO), are commonly incorporated into transparent sunscreen and cosmetic formulations. However, concerns have been raised about potential unwanted effects, despite their negligible skin penetration and inherent advantages over organic chemical UV-filters. To provide useful application-relevant assessments of their potential hazard with/without UVA co-exposure, we directly compared cytotoxic and immune response profiles of human THP- 1 monocytic cells to ZnO nanoparticles (30 nm) with bulk ZnO particulates (200 nm) and five conventional organic chemical UV-filters - butylmethoxydibenzoylmethane (avobenzone), octylmethoxycinnamate, octylsalicylate, <b>homosalate</b> and 4 -methylbenzylidene camphor. High exposure concentrations of both organic and particulate UV-filters were required to cause cytotoxicity in monocyte and macrophage cultures after 24 h. Co-exposure with UVA (6. 7 J/cm 2) did not alter cytotoxicity profiles. Particle surface area-based dose responses showed that ZnO NPs were better tolerated than bulk ZnO. Organic and particulate UV-filters increased apoptosis at similar doses. Only particulates increased the generation of reactive oxygen species. Interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) release was increased by all particulates, avobenzone, <b>homosalate</b> and octylsalicylate. IL- 1 β release was only increased in macrophages by exposure to avobenzone and <b>homosalate.</b> In conclusion, direct effects were caused in monocytes and macrophages at similar concentrations of both organic UV-filters and ZnO nanoparticulates - indicating that their intrinsic cytotoxicity is similar. With their lower skin penetration, ZnO nanoparticles {{are expected to have}} lower bioactivity when used in sunscreens...|$|E

Their presence in human milk and their oestrogenic activity suggests a potential to influence breast cancer development. As metastatic tumour spread is {{the main cause of}} breast cancer mortality, we have investigated the effects of these compounds on migration and invasion of human breast cancer cell lines. Increased motility of oestrogen-responsive MCF- 7 human breast cancer cells was observed after long-term exposure (> 20 weeks) to each of the six compounds at ≥ 10 − 7 m concentrations using three independent assay systems (scratch assay, live cell imaging, xCELLigence technology) and increased invasive activity was observed through matrigel using the xCELLigence system. Increased motility of oestrogen-unresponsive MDA-MB- 231 human breast cancer cells was observed after 15 weeks of exposure to each of the six compounds by live cell imaging and xCELLigence technology, implying the increased migratory activity was not confined to oestrogen-responsive cells. Molecular mechanisms varied between compounds and cell lines. Using MCF- 7 cells, reduction in E-cadherin was observed following 24 weeks' exposure to 10 − 5 m BP- 1 and 10 − 5 m <b>homosalate,</b> and reduction in β-catenin was noted following 24 weeks' exposure to 10 − 5 m OMC. Using MDA-MB- 231 cells, increased levels of matrix metalloproteinase 2 were observed after 15 weeks exposure to 10 − 7 m OMC and 10 − 7 m 4 -methylbenzilidenecamphor. Although molecular mechanisms differ, these results demonstrate that exposure to any of these six compounds can increase migration and invasion of human breast cancer cells...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThree lichen {{extracts}} and ten lichenic compounds {{have been}} screened for their photoprotective activities.

40|$|Background: To explain {{observed}} differences during SPF determination {{using either}} an in vivo or in vitro method, we hypothesized {{on the presence}} of ingredients having anti-inflammatory properties. Methodology/Principal Findings: To research our hypothesis, we studied the 21 UV filters both available on the market and authorized by European regulations and subjected these filters to the phorbol-myristate-acetate test using mice. We then catalogued the 13 filters demonstrating a significant anti-inflammatory effect with edema inhibition percentages of more than 70 %. The filters are: diethylhexyl butamido triazone (92 %), benzophenone- 5 and titanium dioxide (90 %), benzophenone- 3 (83 %), octocrylène and isoamyl p-methoxycinnamate (82 %), PEG- 25 PABA and <b>homosalate</b> (80 %), octyl triazone and phenylbenzimidazole sulfonic acid (78 %), octyl dimethyl PABA (75 %), bis-ethylhexyloxyphenol methoxyphenyl triazine and diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexylbenzoate (70 %).

40|$|Ultraviolet (UV) screens are {{increasingly}} {{used as a}} result of growing concern about UV radiation and skin cancer; they are also added to cosmetics and other products for light stability. Recent data on bioaccumulation in wildlife and humans point to a need for in-depth analyses of systemic toxicology, in particular with respect to reproduction and ontogeny. We examined six frequently used UVA and UVB screens for estrogenicity in vitro and in vivo. In MCF- 7 breast cancer cells, five out of six chemicals, that is, benzophenone- 3 (Bp- 3), <b>homosalate</b> (HMS), 4 -methyl-benzylidene camphor (4 -MBC), octyl-methoxycinnamate (OMC), and octyl-dimethyl-PABA (OD-PABA), increased cell proliferation with median effective concentrations (EC 50) values between 1. 56 and 3. 73 µM, whereas butyl-methoxydibenzoylmethane (B-MDM) was inactive. Further evidence for estrogenic activity was the induction of pS 2 protein in MCF- 7 cells and the blockade of the proliferative effect of 4 -MBC by the estrogen antagonist ICI 182, 780. In the uterotrophic assay using immature Long-Evans rats that received the chemicals for 4 days in powdered feed, uterine weight was dose-dependently increased by 4 -MBC (ED 50 309 mg/kg/day), OMC (ED 50 935 mg/kg/day), and weakly by Bp- 3 (active at 1, 525 mg/kg/day). Three compounds were inactive by the oral route in the doses tested. Dermal application of 4 -MBC to immature hairless (hr/hr) rats also increased uterine weight at concentrations of 5 and 7. 5 % in olive oil. Our findings indicate that UV screens should be tested for endocrine activity, in view of possible long-term effects in humans and wildlife.

40|$|The {{fact that}} certain {{ultraviolet}} (UV) filters used in cosmetics display estrogenic activity prompted us to study potential actions on androgen receptors (AR) {{in the human}} breast carcinoma cell line MDA-kb 2, which expresses functional endogenous AR and glucocorticoid receptors (GR) and is stably transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT), methyltrienolone (R 1881), methyltestosterone, danazol, and androstenedione increased luciferase activity, with EC 50 values between 0. 11 nM (R 1881), 0. 14 nM (DHT), and 73. 5 nM (androstenedione). DHT-induced luciferase gene expression was inhibited by nonsteroidal antiandrogens, hydroxyflutamide, flutamide, bicalutamide, and vinclozolin. In contrast, the steroidal AR agonist/antagonist cyproterone actetate showed agonistic activity in the absence and presence of DHT, which was not blocked by hydroxyflutamide and thus seems not to be mediated by AR. GR-mediated activation of luciferase by dexamethasone was 100 times less potent than DHT and was not antagonized by hydroxyflutamide. The cell line was used for screening of UV filters, benzophenone- 3 (Bp- 3), benzophenone- 4, 3 -benzylidene camphor, 4 -methylbenzylidene camphor, butyl-methoxy-dibenzoylmethane, <b>homosalate</b> (HMS), octyl-dimethyl-PABA, and octyl-methoxycinnamate. Two of these, Bp- 3 and HMS, antagonized DHT-induced AR activation below cytotoxic concentrations, with IC 50 of 5. 57 10 − 6 M (HMS) and 4. 98 10 − 6 M (Bp- 3). None of the eight UV filters displayed agonistic activity when tested alone, but high concentrations of Bp- 3 induced an increase of luciferase activity {{in the presence of}} dexamethasone, which was not blocked by hydroxyflutamide or the estrogen antagonist, ICI 182, 780.

40|$|Biogenic {{volatile}} organic compounds (BVOC) produced by plants {{are known to have}} an important role in atmospheric chemistry. However, our knowledge of the range of BVOCs produced by different plant processes is still expanding, and there remain poorly understood categories of BVOCs. In this study, emissions of a novel class of BVOC emissions were investigated in a desert region. Our study considered 8 species of common desert plants: blackbrush (Coleogyne ramosissima), desert willow (Chilopsis linearis), mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa), mondel pine (Pinus eldarica), pinyon pine (Pinus monophylla), cottonwood (Populus deltoides), saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea) and yucca (Yucca baccata). The measurements focused on BVOCs with relatively high molecular weight (&gt;C 15 ) and/or an oxygenated functional group. Significantly high emission rates of two salicylic esters were found for blackbrush, desert willow and mesquite with emission rates of 3. 1, 1. 0 and 4. 8 μgC dwg&minus; 1 h&minus; 1 , respectively (dwg; dry weight of the leaves in gram). The salicylic esters were identified as 2 -ethylhexenyl salicylate (2 -EHS) and 3, 3, 5 -trimethylcyclohexenyl salicylate (<b>homosalate)</b> and are known as effective ultraviolet (UV) absorbers. We propose that the plants derive a protective benefit against UV radiation from the salicylic esters and that the emission process is driven by the physical evaporation of the salicylic esters due to the high ambient temperatures. In addition, the salicylic esters are predicted to be an effective precursor of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) because they probably produce oxidation products that can condense onto the aerosol phase. We estimated the contribution of the sunscreen esters themselves and their oxidation products on the SOA formation for the Las Vegas area using a BVOC emission model. The contribution was estimated to reach 50 % of the biogenic terpenoid emission in the landscapes dominated by desert willow and mesquite and 13 % in the Las Vegas area. The contributions to biogenic SOA are likely to be higher due to the potentially high SOA yields of these compounds...|$|E
40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} a major health problem and {{exposure}} to oestrogen is a main risk factor. Many environmental chemicals with oestrogenic activity are known to enter the human breast from exposure through diet, the domestic environment and personal care products. In this study, six chemicals, used to absorb ultraviolet light (UV screens) in consumer products and known to be detectable in human milk, have been studied for their effects on proliferation and migration of MCF- 7, T- 47 -D and MDA-MB- 231 human breast cancer cells. The six chemicals were benzophenone- 1 (Bp 1), benzophenone- 2 (Bp 2), benzophenone- 3 (Bp 3), octylmethoxycinnamate (OMC), 3 -(4 -methylbenzilidene) camphor (4 MBC) and <b>homosalate</b> (HS). All six of these UV screens at 10 - 5 M could induce luciferase activity from an ERELUC reporter gene stably transfected into MCF- 7 cells. Dose-response experiments on proliferation of oestrogen-responsive MCF- 7 and T- 47 -D cells showed increased proliferation following the exposure to the UV screens but not OMC, which {{had no effect on}} proliferation of MCF- 7 cells except when cells are seeded on a laminin matrix. No effect on MDA-MB- 231 cell proliferation was recorded. Although the oestrogenic activity of these chemicals has been shown to influence proliferation, this {{is only one of the}} hallmarks of cancer cells. Another important hallmark is activation of invasion and metastasis which is relevant for breast cancer where mortality arises not from growth of the primary tumour but from metastatic tumour spread. Effects of these UV screens have therefore been studied on migration and invasion of MCF- 7, T- 47 -D and MDA-MB- 231 cells following prior (2 weeks) or (up to 30 weeks) exposure using a wound healing assay, time-lapse microscopy or xCELLigence technology. 2 weeks of exposure to 10 - 5 M OMC, 4 MBC and HS increased the motility of MCF- 7 cells as determined by xCELLigence technology or time-lapse microscopy. 21 weeks of exposure to 10 - 5 M Bp 1, Bp 3, to 10 - 7 M concentrations of OMC, 4 MBC and HS increased the motility of MCF- 7 cells. Results using western immunoblotting suggest a decrease in E-cadherin mRNA levels by 10 - 5 M Bp 1, Bp 3, OMC, 4 MBS and HS and protein levels of cells exposed to 10 - 5 M Bp 1 and HS. 10 - 5 M Bp 1 also increased the secretion of MMP- 9 as measured by zymography and the protein levels of pro-MMP- 14 as measured by western immunoblotting. β-catenin protein was reduced in MCF- 7 cells following the exposure to 10 - 5 M OMC, which also reduced the mRNA levels of other two molecular markers of motility (PIK 3 R 1 and BMP 7). T- 47 -D cells exposed to 10 - 5 M of the UV screens have shown an increase in motility as determined by xCELLigence but only Bp 1 increased the migration as determined by wound healing. MDA-MB- 231 cells showed no increase in motility following 2 weeks of exposure to the UV screens. However, 8 weeks of exposure to 10 - 7 M Bp 2, Bp 3, 4 MBC and HS increased the cells motility as determined by the xCELLigence and 15 weeks of exposure to 10 - 7 M of the UV screens increased the motility of MDA-MB- 231 cell as measured by the time-lapse microscopy. OMC and 4 MBC increased the secretion of MMP- 2 by MDA-MB- 231 cells. Overall, these results demonstrate for the first time that these six UV screens can influence not only proliferation but also migration of human breast cancer cells...|$|E
