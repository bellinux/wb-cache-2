40|$|Developing {{efficient}} and inexpensive energy storage devices {{is an important}} as developing new sources of energy. The material element was designed for storing high charging and low discharging efficiency. The size of the element was taken such that exposed contact surface area could be high. The thermal energy storage (TES) {{can be defined as}} the temporary storage of thermal energy at high or low temperatures [...] Energy storage can reduce the time or rate mismatch between energy supply and energy demand, and it {{plays an important role in}} energy conservation. Energy storage improves performance of energy systems by smoothing supply and increasing reliability. For example, storage would improve the performance of a power generating plant by load leveling. The higher efficiency would lead to energy conservation and improve cost effectiveness. The demand for energy, on the other hand, is also unsteady following yearly and diurnal cycles for both industrial and personal needs. The thermal properties are strongly influenced by the deposit physical structure, i. e. the particle size distribution, the porosity and the degree of sintering. Thermal storage can utilize sensible or latent heat mechanisms or heat from chemical reactions. Sensible heat is the means of storing energy by increasing the temperature of a solid or liquid. Latent heat, on the other hand, is the means of storing energy via the <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>transition</b> from a solid to liquid state...|$|E

These disc-like molecules {{are composed of}} six aliphatic chains attached to the central benzene nucleus by six ester bonds. The hydrophilic ester groups act as pinning points and hold the benzene nucleus flat on the water surface. For the lower homologs BH- 5 to BH- 7, we observe that the so-called liquid expanded phase obtained at high areas per molecule transforms into the liquid condensed phase upon lateral compression. The transition is approximately first-order, with a plateau region of finite slope and a single discontinuity in the monolayer compressibility. The associated <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>transition,</b> as calculated from the Clapeyron equation, decreases linearly with temperature and extrapolates to zero at the critical temperature Tcrit. Above Tcrit, the transition disappears and the liquid expanded phase is observed at all areas per molecule.

We interpret the phase change as an order-disorder transition of the aliphatic chains from a gauche to an all-trans conformation.
