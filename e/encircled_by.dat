Peng then met with Zhu and Mao, and they reorganized their forces and decided to form a base area around the Ruijin, Jiangxi, an agricultural city that was only defended by weak warlord units. Zhu and Mao occupied the area, informally beginning the Jiangxi Soviet in January 1929.|$|E

Malcolm, the king of Scotland, responded with a written agreement, accepting that Magnus' had sovereign authority of over all the western lands that Magnus could <b>encircle</b> <b>by</b> boat.

The player sets Maxwell free, but he turns into a skeleton and disintegrates as soon as he stands up. The ghostly arms from the trailer then grab the player and ensnare them in the throne.

5|$|By 13 August, the {{offensive}} had fully halted, with German forces being {{driven out of}} Mortain. The Germans had lost 120 tanks and assault guns to Allied counter-attacks and air strikes, {{more than two-thirds of}} their committed total. As Hitler ordered German forces in Normandy to hold their positions, the U.S. VII and XV Corps were swinging east and north toward Argentan. The German attack west left the 7th Army and Panzergruppe West in danger of being <b>encircled</b> <b>by</b> Allied forces. As American forces advanced on Argentan, British and Canadian forces advanced on Falaise, threatening to cut off both armies in the newly formed Falaise Pocket.|$|E

5|$|In 1838, the American Bible scholar Edward Robinson visited Bayt Jibrin, and {{identified}} it as ancient Eleutheropolis. The {{remains of the}} city of Maresha on Tell Sandahanna/Tel Maresha were first excavated in 1898-1900 by Bliss and Macalister, who uncovered a planned and fortified Hellenistic city <b>encircled</b> <b>by</b> a town wall with towers. Two Hellenistic and one Israelite stratum were identified by them on the mound. Between 1989-2000, large-scale excavations were held by the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) under the direction of Prof. Amos Kloner and conducted mainly in the Lower City of Maresha, concentrating both on the surface and on the subterranean complexes. Excavations continued in several subterranean complexes between 2001 and 2008.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the 195th Tank Brigade's {{commander}} took {{command of}} 32 repaired and recovered tanks from the 12th and 15th Corps at Novaya Vodolaga, defending the town alongside the 253rd Rifle Brigade. There, they withstood {{three days of}} attacks from LSSAH until 6 March, when their positions began to be <b>encircled</b> <b>by</b> LSSAH and the SS-Totenkopf Division. During {{the next few days}} the brigade retreated north of the Mzha River to Rakitnoye, which was given up on 9 March. The 195th then took up defensive positions in the Ozeryanka area.|$|E

5|$|Once Soviet {{resistance}} {{along the}} Vyazma-Bryansk front was eliminated, German forces were to press east, <b>encircling</b> Moscow <b>by</b> outflanking {{it from the}} north and south. Continuous fighting had reduced their effectiveness, and logistical difficulties became more acute. Guderian wrote that some of his destroyed tanks had not been replaced, and there were fuel shortages {{at the start of the}} operation.|$|R
50|$|Rigan fails in her {{attempts}} to <b>encircle</b> Earth <b>by</b> influencing Arthur. Arthur chooses M'rlendd over her, foiling her plans to defeat M'rlendd and stealing {{half of her}} jade circlet, influenced with Circle power. Rigan is also pregnant with the M'rlendd's son, a result of him forcing himself on her. Rigan's only thoughts are of stopping M'rlendd and preventing the Line from winning Earth.|$|R
5|$|On 27 June, the division's {{defensive}} {{positions at}} Minqar Qaim were <b>encircled</b> <b>by</b> the 21st Panzer Division. The battalion {{was the lead}} unit {{of one of the}} columns, numbering 900 vehicles and guns, of the division, in the subsequent breakout that night. In the course of this movement, Gray's column ran into an encampment of tanks of the 21st Panzer Division. However, the Germans failed to capitalise on the opportunity and the train of vehicles, with Gray at its head to ensure it did not come to a stop, was able to skirt the panzers with relatively few losses and reach the Alamein lines.|$|E
