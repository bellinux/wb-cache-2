Additionally, widespread implementations of <b>IoT</b> <b>devices</b> expand cyberattack surfaces exposed to disruptive agents, raising significant cybersecurity concerns {{in the context of}} ADN. Given that ADN operations depend heavily on the extended network of intelligent <b>IoT</b> <b>devices</b> across a power distribution infrastructure, any credible cyberattack on <b>IoT</b> <b>devices</b> may jeopardize the security of ADN operation and even lead to a system-wide blackout.|$|R

30|$|Internet-of-Things (<b>IoT)</b> <b>devices</b> must operate {{for long}} periods on limited power {{supplies}} and {{research has shown that}} wireless communication is the primary source of energy consumption in <b>IoT</b> <b>devices</b> [1]. The lifetime of IoT applications can therefore be increased by minimising radio communication. Data aggregation has been widely applied to tackle this problem [2 – 4]. Data aggregation is a technique in which multiple messages are combined in to a single datagram, thus reducing radio transmissions and hence the energy consumption of <b>IoT</b> <b>devices.</b> Furthermore in CSMA networks, less frequent transmissions result in fewer collisions and therefore retransmissions. This significantly improves the performance of <b>IoT</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{efficient}} deployment and mobility of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), used as aerial base stations {{to collect data}} from ground Internet of Things (<b>IoT)</b> <b>devices,</b> is investigated. In particular, to enable reliable uplink communications for <b>IoT</b> <b>devices</b> with a minimum total transmit power, a novel framework is proposed for jointly optimizing the three-dimensional (3 D) placement and mobility of the UAVs, device-UAV association, and uplink power control. First, given the locations of active <b>IoT</b> <b>devices</b> at each time instant, the optimal UAVs' locations and associations are determined. Next, to dynamically serve the <b>IoT</b> <b>devices</b> in a time-varying network, the optimal mobility patterns of the UAVs are analyzed. To this end, based on the activation process of the <b>IoT</b> <b>devices,</b> the time instances at which the UAVs must update their locations are derived. Moreover, the optimal 3 D trajectory of each UAV is obtained {{in a way that}} the total energy used for the mobility of the UAVs is minimized while serving the <b>IoT</b> <b>devices.</b> Simulation results show that, using the proposed approach, the total transmit power of the <b>IoT</b> <b>devices</b> is reduced by 45 % compared to a case in which stationary aerial base stations are deployed. In addition, the proposed approach can yield a maximum of 28 % enhanced system reliability compared to the stationary case. The results also reveal an inherent tradeoff between the number of update times, the mobility of the UAVs, and the transmit power of the <b>IoT</b> <b>devices.</b> In essence, a higher number of updates can lead to lower transmit powers for the <b>IoT</b> <b>devices</b> at the cost of an increased mobility for the UAVs.

40|$|Securing the Internet of Things (IoT) is a {{necessary}} milestone toward expediting the deployment of its applications and services. In particular, the functionality of the <b>IoT</b> <b>devices</b> is extremely dependent on {{the reliability of the}}ir message transmission. Cyber attacks such as data injection, eavesdropping, and man-in-the-middle threats can lead to security challenges. Securing <b>IoT</b> <b>devices</b> against such attacks requires accounting for their stringent computational power and need for low-latency operations. In this paper, a novel deep learning method is proposed for dynamic watermarking of IoT signals to detect cyber attacks. The proposed learning framework, based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) structure, enables the <b>IoT</b> <b>devices</b> to extract a set of stochastic features from their generated signal and dynamically watermark these features into the signal. This method enables the IoT's cloud center, which collects signals from the <b>IoT</b> <b>devices,</b> to effectively authenticate the reliability of the signals. Furthermore, the proposed method prevents complicated attack scenarios such as eavesdropping in which the cyber attacker collects the data from the <b>IoT</b> <b>devices</b> and aims to break the watermarking algorithm. Simulation results show that, with an attack detection delay of under 1 second the messages can be transmitted from <b>IoT</b> <b>devices</b> with an almost 100 % reliability.

In particular, to enable reliable uplink communications for <b>IoT</b> <b>devices</b> with a minimum energy consumption, a new approach for optimal mobility of the UAVs is proposed. First, given a fixed ground IoT network, the total transmit power of the devices is minimized by properly clustering the <b>IoT</b> <b>devices</b> with each cluster being served by one UAV. Next, to maintain energy-efficient communications in time-varying mobile IoT networks, the optimal trajectories of the UAVs are determined by exploiting the framework of optimal transport theory.

40|$|IoT {{devices are}} in general {{considered}} to be straightforward to use. However, we find {{that there are a}} number of situations where the usability becomes poor. The situations include but not limited to the followings: 1) when initializing an <b>IoT</b> <b>device,</b> 2) when trying to control an <b>IoT</b> <b>device</b> which is initialized and registered by another person, and 3) when trying to control an <b>IoT</b> <b>device</b> out of many of the same type. We tackle these situations by proposing a new association-free communication method, QuickTalk. QuickTalk lets a user device such as a smartphone pinpoint and activate an <b>IoT</b> <b>device</b> with the help of an IR transmitter and communicate with the pinpointed <b>IoT</b> <b>device</b> through the broadcast channel of WiFi. By the nature of its association-free communication, QuickTalk allows a user device to immediately give a command to a specific <b>IoT</b> <b>device</b> in proximity even when the <b>IoT</b> <b>device</b> is uninitialized, unregistered to the control interface of the user, or registered but being physically confused with others. Our experiments of QuickTalk implemented on Raspberry Pi 2 devices show that the end-to-end delay of QuickTalk is upper bounded by 2. 5 seconds and its median is only about 0. 74 seconds. We further confirm that even when an <b>IoT</b> <b>device</b> has ongoing data sessions, QuickTalk can still establish a reliable communication channel to the <b>IoT</b> <b>device</b> with little impact to the ongoing sessions.

40|$|The Internet of Things (IoT) is {{creating}} {{a revolution in the}} number of connected devices. Cisco reported that there were 25 billion <b>IoT</b> <b>devices</b> in 2015 and modest estimation that this number will almost double by 2020. Society has become dependent on these billions of devices, devices that are connected and communicating with each other all the time with information constantly share between users, services, and internet providers. The emergent <b>IoT</b> <b>devices</b> as a technology are creating a huge security rift between users and usability, sacrificing usability for security created a number of major issues. First, <b>IoT</b> <b>devices</b> are classified under Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) that blows any organization security boundary and make them a target for espionage or tracking. Second, the size of the data generated from IoT makes big data problems pale in comparison not to mention <b>IoT</b> <b>devices</b> need a real-time response. Third, is incorporating secure access and control for <b>IoT</b> <b>devices</b> ranging from edge nodes devices to application level (business intelligence reporting tools) is a challenge because it has to account for several hardware and application levels. Establishing a secure access control model between different <b>IoT</b> <b>devices</b> and services is a major milestone for the IoT. This is important because data leakage and unauthorized access to data have a high impact on our <b>IoT</b> <b>devices.</b> However, traditional access control models with the static and rigid infrastructure cannot provide the required security for the IoT infrastructure. Therefore, this paper proposes a risk-based access control model for IoT technology that takes into account real-time data information request for <b>IoT</b> <b>devices</b> and gives dynamic feedback. The proposed model uses IoT environment features to estimate the security risk associated with each access request using user context, resource sensitivity, action severity and risk history as inputs for security risk estimation algorithm that is responsible for access decision. Then the proposed model uses smart contracts to provide adaptive features in which the user behaviour is monitored to detect any abnormal actions from authorized users. <br/...|$|R
40|$|The Internet of Things (IoT) is an {{infrastructure}} that interconnects uniquely-identifiable devices using the Internet. By interconnecting everyday appliances, various monitoring, and physical mashup applications {{can be constructed}} to improve human’s daily life. In general, <b>IoT</b> <b>devices</b> provide two main capabilities: sensing and tasking capabilities. While the sensing capability {{is similar to the}} World-Wide Sensor Web, this research focuses on the tasking capability.

In particular, devices {{not included in}} a white list of trustworthy <b>IoT</b> <b>device</b> types (allowed to be used within the organizational premises) should be detected. In this research, Random Forest, a supervised machine learning algorithm, was applied to features extracted from network traffic data {{with the aim of}} accurately identifying <b>IoT</b> <b>device</b> types from the white list. To train and evaluate multi-class classifiers, we collected and manually labeled network traffic data from 17 distinct IoT devices, representing nine types of IoT devices. Based on the classification of 20 consecutive sessions and the use of majority rule, <b>IoT</b> <b>device</b> types that are not on the white list were correctly detected as unknown in 96 % of test cases (on average), and white listed device types were correctly classified by their actual types in 99 % of cases. Some <b>IoT</b> <b>device</b> types were identified quicker than others (e. g., sockets and thermostats were successfully detected within five TCP sessions of connecting to the network). Perfect detection of unauthorized <b>IoT</b> <b>device</b> types was achieved upon analyzing 110 consecutive sessions; perfect classification of white listed types required 346 consecutive sessions, 110 of which resulted in 99. 49 % accuracy.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} protecting distributed IoT units from network based attacks while still having {{a high level of}} availability.

This machine has very high availability and high attack resistance. The <b>IoT</b> <b>device</b> will only communicate with the mirror machine in the cloud using a dedicated synchronization protocol. All essential IoT state information and state manipulations are communicated through this synchronization protocol while all end application communication directed towards the IoT units is done towards the mirror machine in the cloud. This gives a very robust and secure system with high availability at the price of slower responses. However, for many non-real time IoT application with high security demands this performance penalty can be justified...|$|E
