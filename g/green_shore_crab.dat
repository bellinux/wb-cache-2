40|$|Previous {{studies on}} intra-specific {{interactions}} among <b>green</b> <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> have been undertaken in very large populations, {{in which individuals}} concentrate at high densities in physically complex substrates. Under such conditions, cannibalism and interference competition often override initial density patterns delivered by larval supply. In this study, we focused on a Carcinus maenas population receiving a low supply of settlers. We reported crab abundance in habitats of different physical structure, and measured cannibalistic interactions, in different substrates, at a prey density expected only after a major recruitment event. Different predator and prey sizes were used to verify if juveniles froma critical range attain a size refugewhen coexistingwith subadults, which are still commonly found in the nursery habitat. Virtually no juvenile <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> were found on sandy habitats, and differences between sparsely and densely vegetated cover were only detected shortly after a settlement pulse, indicating that nursery habitats are under their carrying capacity most of the time. Even under extreme high densities, cannibalism on juveniles of 10 mm carapace width (CW) remained undetected, and predation on crabs half this sizewas only significant in lowand mediumZostera cover,when larger predators (20 – 25 mmCW) were included in experimental plots. The allometricmodel predicted the non-linear decrease of predation rate {{as a function of}} relative prey size, with a nearly asymptotic value of one prey consumed each 5 d by one predator in a square metre, when relative prey size attains 0. 6. Such a relationship is expected for ‘cruising’ predators which rely on encounter rate.

40|$|In the Ostend {{population}} (Belgium, Southern North Sea) of <b>green</b> <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> Carcinus maenas, {{the animals}} mate {{immediately after the}} moult of the female, from April to November but mainly from June to October. Ovigerous females are found from December to August but they become scarce from July onwards. The size of the mating females gradually decreases from June to October. That is due to two facts. Firstly, most females that mate in June are old specimens that have bred at least once; the proportion of these females diminishes in the next months to leave place to young females that have never bred. Secondly, {{the size of the}} females mating for the first time decreases from July to October. Part of the small females that have already moulted and mated at the beginning of summer moult and mate for a second time from August onwards after a short sterile intermoult. The average carapace breadth of the females breeding in winter is large. The proportion of small ovigerous females increases in May and decreases afterwards. Part of females spawning in winter have again ripe ovaries in April-June. These females are mainly the large ones. Therefore it is suggested that large females can breed twice or three times each year in the same intermoult (in winter, in spring and sometimes at beginning of summer) and that the small females would breed usually only once, in spring. The average size of the mating males remains nearly constant through the season although there is a slight increase of the small males proportion in the couples after July...|$|R

40|$|Mass {{mortality}} of common ciders (Somateria mollissima) {{was observed in}} winter 1999 / 2000 in the Dutch Wadden Sea. Approximately 21, 000 common eiders died. Dissected birds were severely emaciated and 94 % were infected with the acanthocephalan parasite Profilicollis botulus. <b>Green</b> <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> (Carcinus maenas), intermediate hosts of the parasite, were slightly more 'available' than in other years, but parasite infections in the eiders were close to normal. Few eiders were oiled (5 %), there were no toxicological, bacteriological, or virological explanations for the observed mortality. In the Wadden Sea, a wetland of international importance, mussel (Mytilus edulis) cultures occur in sublittoral areas, while mechanical cockle (Cerastoderma edule) fisheries are licensed annually after evaluation of available resources. The wintering ciders in 1999 / 2000 required c. 3. 1 million kg ash-free dry mass, while information on mussel and cockle stocks (irrespective of accessibility and profitability) suggested a resource 4. 7 x the requirement of common ciders only. Food shortage is suggested to have caused the observed mortality, involving both principal (mussels and cockles) and secondary (Spisula) prey. Winter census reports showed shifts in wintering distribution of common eiders in the 1990 s, indicating the milisation of Soisula in the North Sea in poor food years in the Wadden Sea. Following particularly intense fisheries in summer 1999, attempts to feed on Spisula in winter 1999 / 2000 failed. It is hypothesised that overfishing of mussels and cockles in the Wadden Sea in the early 1990 s resulted in structurally reduced food resources, contractions of the foraging area of common ciders, and increased use of secondary prey in the North Sea.

40|$|The blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, is a {{valuable}} resource in the Coastal Bays, supporting a steady commercial and recreational fishery. Surveys suggest that blue crab abundance fluctuates without an apparent trend, yet {{there is still a}} successful annual commercial fishery that even attracts crabbers from the Chesapeake Bay. Since 1990, commercial landings for crabs have averaged from 0. 5 to 1. 5 million pounds. Commercial landings for 2003 were 1. 17 million pounds. Unlike Chesapeake Bay landings data, these appear to fluctuate without trend. During 2003, the fishery independent trawl and seine survey caught a total of 6, 754 blue crabs. An examination of 2, 627 legal blue crabs taken by trawl net over a 13 - year period indicates no decline in average size, suggesting minimal increases in fishing pressure.

40|$|The authors 2016. Fine-scale {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} variation in the genetic composition of benthic recruits, known as chaotic genetic patchiness, is often observed in marine and estuarine species with planktonic larvae. Several explanations have been proposed for chaotic genetic patchiness, including sweepstakes reproductive success, variability in larval source, and natural selection. In {{a survey of the}} <b>green</b> <b>shore</b> <b>crab</b> Hemigrapsus oregonensis in Bodega Bay, California, USA, allele frequencies at a mitochondrial single nucleotide polymorphism were found to differ significantly among samples of first-stage zoeae and between zoeae and adults. Sweepstakes reproductive success is unlikely to be responsible because the fecundity of this species is too low and there was no reduction in genetic diversity among zoeae. In principle, influxes of larvae from genetically distinct populations over 500 km to the north could have caused these differences; however, coalescent estimates indicated that gene flow from these distant populations has been very low and it is unlikely that first-stage zoeae would have been transported such great distances. The possibility remains that natural selection, directly or indirectly, is responsible for the observed patchiness in mitochondrial allele frequencies...|$|E

40|$|Synopsis Expressed {{sequence}} tags (ESTs) {{were produced}} for normalized cDNA libraries prepared from several tissues of 2 marine crustaceans, the <b>green</b> <b>shore</b> <b>crab</b> Carcinus maenas and the American lobster Homarus americanus. Tissues {{represented in the}} Carcinus library were anterior and posterior gills, hypodermis, heart, hepatopancreas, antennal gland, brain, testis, and skeletal muscle, obtained from animals acclimated to 35 and 10 ‰ salinity. Tissues represented in the Homarus library were gill, epipodite, branchiostegite, heart, ovary, testis, antennal gland, skeletal muscle, hepatopancreas, and brain, obtained from intermolt and post-molt animals. Directional libraries from oligo-dT-primed cDNA were constructed in the pCMVsport 6. 1 vector and normalized by self-subtraction at 2 different Cot values. Randomly picked clones were single-pass sequenced from the 5 0 end. Raw sequence data were trimmed and prepared for submission to dbEST using phred, cross-match, and blastx protocols embedded within trace 2 dbest software.

40|$|Global {{warming is}} {{considered}} to be the most adverse consequence from the increasing anthropogenic emissions of CO 2. However, in the marine environment additional problems related to the elevated levels atmospheric CO 2 may arise; the increased amount of CO 2 absorbed by the oceans may lead to a moderate, but consistent and global reduction in seawater pH due to the acidifying effect of CO 2, a phenomenon referred to as ocean acidification. Another potential problem may occur as a result of sub-seabed storage of anthropogenic CO 2, a disposal alternative introduced by the gas industry to mitigate CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere. Leakage from such storage sites could potentially cause a relatively local, but extreme acidification of the seawater near the leakage site. Both scenarios may create unfavourable conditions for marine organisms, and previous studies have reported that environmental hypercapnia (elevated pCO 2) may affect an array of physiological processes in marine organisms such as acid-base status and metabolic rate. Deep-living animals are considered to be particularly vulnerable to environmental hypercapnia due to their low metabolic rate and poor ability to counteract effects of environmental stressors. To predict the possible outcome of the two scenarios described above {{it is important to understand}} the physiological mechanisms that marine organisms apply to handle the CO 2 stress. During conditions of elevated seawater pCO 2, the charge neutral CO 2 molecules permeate biological membranes and react with water in the body fluids resulting in the net formation of HCO 3 - and H+. Thus, the primary effect of elevated pCO 2 is induction of body fluid acidosis. Acid-base regulation during acidosis is generally mediated by buffering compounds as well as acid elimination through direct removal of hydrogen ions (H+) and/or accumulation of buffering bicarbonate ions (HCO 3 -). In the current thesis the deep-sea bivalve Acesta excavata, the <b>green</b> <b>shore</b> <b>crab</b> Carcinus maenas, and the deep-water prawn Pandalus borealis were exposed to elevated seawater levels of pCO 2. The purpose was to study the responses of the different species to elevated pCO 2 and to compare the capacity of shallow- and deep-living animals to counteract CO 2 -induced effects. To meet these objectives changes in acid-base relevant parameters (pH, pCO 2, [HCO 3 -]) and metabolic rate was studied in all three species, while gene expression and activity of ion regulating proteins as well as changes in the metabolome were determined in C. maenas alone. Calcifying animals, such as bivalves, have been suggested to utilise HCO 3 - from the calcium carbonate shell to buffer acidosis. However, this buffering strategy may be restricted to closed systems such as during shell closure. Indeed, the findings in the present thesis indicate that shell dissolution does not occur in the deep-living bivalve A. excavata in response to CO 2 -induced acidosis. Consequently, A. excavata does not seem to be able to compensate extra- or intracellular acidosis in response to severe environmental hypercapnia, and experiences a drop in metabolic rate most likely induced by low body fluid pH. However, this species displays a relatively high nonbicarbonate buffering capacity, and may therefore be able to tolerate more moderate levels of CO 2 exposure than that experienced in the present study. In decapod crustaceans extracellular pH-regulation occurs in the posterior gills by electroneutral ion exchange between the extracellular fluids and the surrounding seawater. The shore crab C. maenas was able to partially compensate extracellular acidosis by accumulating relatively high levels of HCO 3 - in response to elevated pCO 2, and the degree of compensation was dependent on the level of CO 2 exposure. The results from the present thesis suggest that this species can compensate acidosis without substantially increasing the acid-base regulatory capacity of the branchial ion transporting proteins. Surprisingly, the deep-water prawn Pandalus borealis exhibited similar abilities as the shore crab to counteract extracellular acidosis induced by elevated pCO 2. This was achieved by increasing the extracellular concentration of HCO 3 - to a similar degree as C. maenas. The findings indicate that this species display similar acid-base regulatory capacities as shallow-living decapods, thus nuancing the picture of the compensating capacities of deep-living animals. Acid-base regulation in both decapod species was achieved without affecting the osmolality of the extracellular fluid. This is in contrast to what has been reported for subtidal decapod crabs. The metabolic rate was not significantly affected in any of the two species, possibly due to their ability to maintain extracellular pH close to normal values. While acid-base regulation in response to CO 2 -induced acidosis has received increased scientific attention, only a very few studies have investigated responses of the metabolome to elevated pCO 2. 1 H-NMR metabolomics revealed that in the <b>green</b> <b>shore</b> <b>crab</b> CO 2 exposure induces a shift in the metabolic fingerprint in both hemolymph and extracts of gills and leg muscle. The shift is not the result of changes in metabolites involved in energy metabolism, as could be expected. Rather, it is due to a general decrease in the concentration of metabolites, particularly of important osmolytes such as the amino acids proline and glycine. The observed changes were most prominent after prolonged exposure, suggesting an exhaustive response rather than an active, compensatory mechanism. The results indicate that in response to elevated pCO 2 shore crabs experience symptoms resembling those of animals acclimated to condtions of reduced salinity. This may possibly suggests a disturbance of intracellular isoosmotic regulation. The present thesis indicates that A. excavata would be highly, and possibly permanently affected by severe CO 2 exposure associated with CO 2 leakage, while both the intertidal and deep-living decapods could tolerate relatively prolonged periods of quite severe hypercapnic conditions.

40|$|The {{ecological}} {{effects of}} the <b>green</b> <b>shore</b> <b>crab</b> Carcinus maenas (L.) fishery was investigated in estuaries on the south west coast of the UK. The fishery known as 'crab-tiling' involves 'crab-tilers' laying artificial refugia such as car tyres, guttering or roof tiles, intertidally in estuaries. 'Crab-tiles' are specifically laid on mudflats and sandflats to attract moutling crabs seeking refuge, these crabs are then collected to use or sell as bait for recreational angling. Many estuaries that are crab-tiled are subject {{to a range of}} International, European and National legislation as they are of great conservation importance. For example, they provide feeding grounds for migratory wading shorebirds, and nursery and feeding areas for commercially and ecologically important fishes. Little is known regarding the impacts of the crab-tiling fishery on the-estuarine ecosystem. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the direct effects that crab-tiling has on estuarine fauna, allowing a better understanding of the implications of crab-tiling for ecosystem functioning, subsequently allowing conservation groups to manage crab-tiling activity based on ecologically informed decisions. Efforts to establish the main impacts of crab-tiling focused on infauna that live within sediments where crab-tiles are laid, on estuarine epifauna (such as crabs, birds and benthic fishes) which forage around crab-tiled habitat, and aquatic fauna which utilise the intertidal environment during high tide. To quantify the impact of crab-tiling on populations of the target organism, C. maenas, a mensurative experiment was conducted over six estuaries in south-west England, including three commercially tiled estuaries and three relatively not-tiled estuaries. Estuaries where commercial crab-tiling took place were found to support substantially larger population sizes of C. maenas than not-tiled estuaries although the C. maenas modal size class was smaller, suggesting that, in terms of C. maenas abundance, the effect of crab removal by fisheries was outweighed by the increase in habitat availability due to the presence of crab tiles. The diversity and abundance of wading birds feeding over mud flats was not affected by the presence of crab-tiles, though birds aggregated around the tiles when feeding; conversely, crab-tiles generally had an opposite effect on aquatic fauna, which tended to be more abundant in control sites than in crab-tiled sites. A possible explanation for these observations was associated with the concentration of crabs around the tiles: these localised crab populations could provide prey for wading shore birds, which were seen collecting C. maenas from crab-tiles, but could simultaneously predate on aquatic fauna; during high tide, tiled sites had the highest abundance of crabs, yet control sites had the highest abundance of all the other aquatic fauna. The crab-tiling fishery has been found to cause ecological impacts to a range of estuarine fauna. Changes in any one species abundance could have implications for that species' predator and prey; additionally the abundance mediated change in the ecological functions which they perform, will have consequences for ecological processes within the estuary as a whole. The indirect impacts occurring as a result of the direct effects measured here also need to be quantified so that the full effect that crab-tiling has for ecosystem functioning in estuaries can be understood and effectively managed.

40|$|Facilitation cascades {{generated}} by co-occurring foundation species {{can enhance the}} abundance and diversity of associated organisms. However, it remains poorly understood how differences among native and invasive species {{in their ability to}} exploit these positive interactions contribute to emergent patterns of community structure and biotic acceptance. On intertidal shorelines in New England, we examined the patterns of coexistence between the native mud crabs and the invasive Asian <b>shore</b> <b>crab</b> {{in and out of a}} facilitation cascade habitat {{generated by}} mid intertidal cordgrass and ribbed mussels. These crab species co-occurred in low intertidal cobbles adjacent to the cordgrass–mussel beds, despite experimental findings that the dominant mud crabs can kill and displace Asian <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> and thereby limit their successful recruitment to their shared habitat. A difference between the native and invasive species in their utilization of the facilitation cascade likely contributes to this pattern. Only the Asian <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> inhabit the cordgrass–mussel beds, despite experimental evidence that both species can similarly benefit from stress amelioration in the beds. Moreover, only Asian <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> settle in the beds, which function as a nursery habitat free of lethal mud crabs, and where their recruitment rates are particularly high (nearly an order of magnitude higher than outside beds). Persistence of invasive adult Asian <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> among the dominant native mud crabs in the low cobble zone is likely enhanced by a spillover effect of the facilitation cascade in which recruitment-limited Asian <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> settle in the mid intertidal cordgrass–mussel beds and subsidize their vulnerable populations in the adjacent low cobble zone. This would explain why the abundances of Asian <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> in cobbles are doubled when adjacent to facilitation cascade habitats.

Blue mussels can sense predators by olfactory cues fromthe predators themselves, or by alarm cues from attacked conspecifics, and then developinducible defences. In this experimental study, blue mussels were exposed to either nopredator (control) or to enclosed predators in terms of two <b>shore</b> <b>crabs,</b> two sea stars or thecombination of one <b>shore</b> <b>crab</b> and one sea star, {{over a period of}} six weeks. According to previous studies a good defence against predation from <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> should be athicker and also a more circular mussel shell, and a good defence against sea stars should be astrong posterior adductor muscle. All three predatory treatments resulted in mussel individuals with significantly heavier shells. When exposed to sea stars, individuals grew less lengthwise and showed a significantly lowerend volume, as well as a significantly heavier posterior adductor muscle. These mussels alsoshowed a tendency to survive sea star predation better in the predation test. Thus, induciblephenotypic defences against predation by sea star predation, were clearly demonstrated. Theexposure to <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> resulted in a significantly higher height of the mussels, whencontrolling for mussel length. The mussels exposed to <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> also showed end volumessimilar to control mussels, whereas an exposure to a combination of a crab and a sea starresulted in intermediate end volumes. This supports a phenotypic plasticity in traits related topredator threat. Individuals in all three predatory treatments were harder attached by morebyssus threads {{at the end of the}} experiment. Control mussels and those exposed to a singlecrab and sea star were repeatedly found to be more aggregated (i. e. fewer solitary mussels) over the course of the experiment, whereas the mussels presumably exposed to more olfactorycues from two <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> or two sea stars were more often found solitary and attached bybyssus threads. This study demonstrated inducible defences in how blue mussel allocate their resources todifferent dimensions of growth, shell weight, adductor muscle weight, as well as aggregationand byssus attachment, depending on predatory threat...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to investigate the sex-specific differences to feeding responses of the <b>shore</b> <b>crab</b> Carcinus maenasthroughout the year. Results demonstrate that female <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> exhibit stronger feeding responses than males throughout the year with a significantly reduced feeding response in males during the summer months' reproductive season. We also studied the possible function(s) of the moulting hormone, 20 -hydroxyecdysone (Crustecdysone) that {{has been described as}} a potential female-produced sex pheromone to initiate male reproductive behaviour in a number of crustaceans. We recently presented evidence that for <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> this is not the case and now show that the steroid is instead functioning as a sex-specific feeding deterrent protecting the moulting ‘soft’ female <b>crabs.</b> Whilst male <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> were deterred from prey (Mytilus edulis) and synthetic feeding stimulants glycine and taurine when these feeding stimulants were spiked with crustecdysone, intermoult female crabs were significantly less affected and rarely deterred from feeding. This sex specificity of the moulting hormone, in combination with the female sex pheromone, which has no anti-feeding properties, ensures that male crabs mate with soft-shelled, moulted females rather than engage in cannibalism, such as found frequently in cases when soft-shelled females are exposed to intermoult females...|$|R

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest to restore the ecosystem services that eelgrass provides, after their continuous worldwide decline. Most attempts to restore eelgrass using seeds are challenged by very high seed losses {{and the reasons for}} these losses are not all clear. We assess the impact of predation on seed loss and eelgrass establishment, and explore methods to decrease seed loss during restoration in the Swedish northwest coast. In a laboratory study we identified three previously undescribed seed predators, the <b>shore</b> <b>crab</b> Carcinus maenas, the hermit crab Pagurus bernhardus and the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, of which <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> consumed 2 - 7 times more seeds than the other two species. The importance of <b>shore</b> <b>crabs</b> as seed predators was supported in field cage experiments where one enclosed crab caused 73 % loss of seeds over a 1 -week period on average (~ 21 seeds per day). Seedling establishment was significantly higher (14 %) in cages that excluded predators over an 8 -month period than in uncaged plots and cages that allowed predators but prevented seed-transport (0. 5 %), suggesting that seed predation constitutes a major source of seed loss in the study area. Burying the seeds 2 cm below the sediment surface prevented seed predation in the laboratory and decreased predation in the field, constituting a way to decrease seed loss during restoration. <b>Shore</b> <b>crabs</b> may act as a key feedback mechanism that prevent the return of eelgrass both by direct consumption of eelgrass seeds and as a predator of algal mesograzers, allowing algal mats to overgrow eelgrass beds. This <b>shore</b> <b>crab</b> feedback mechanism could become self-generating by promoting the growth of its own nursery habitat (algal mats) and by decreasing the nursery habitat (seagrass meadow) of its dominant predator (cod). This double feedback-loop is supported by a strong increase of <b>shore</b> <b>crab</b> abundance in the last decades and may partly explain the regime shift in vegetation observed along the Swedish west coast...|$|R
