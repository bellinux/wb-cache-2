25|$|Springer's {{uncertain}} {{health was}} also a concern; Canadian officials refused to accept an orca with any communicable diseases. Returning Springer to her home waters would require the political, scientific, logistical and <b>financial</b> <b>cooperation</b> of federal agencies and multiple organizations in two countries, {{as well as the}} consent of the First Nations. Capturing and moving an orca risked further stress and injury. Local media continued covering the situation, with advocates demanding immediate government action to save the orca. Public sentiment strongly favored rescue as Springer's health deteriorated and her attraction to boats and people increased.|$|E

25|$|In 1993, ABCLS {{entered into}} a {{partnership}} with Fort Steele Heritage Town to move the historic home and land surveying office of Thomas Thane McVittie to the Heritage Town site across British Columbia Highway 93-95. The project was made possible through the joint <b>financial</b> <b>cooperation</b> of the Association of BC Land Surveyors, Fort Steele Heritage Town, Friends of Fort Steele, and the Teck Corporation. Hundreds of hours of restoration efforts by Association members and interested volunteers resulted in several improvements and updates being carried out on the structures.

25|$|Between 2003 and 2007, the EU {{committed}} round €33 {{million to}} the Water Supply Programme to Regional Centres, jointly financed by German <b>financial</b> <b>cooperation.</b> The main objective of the programme was to improve the access to sustainable quality water supply and wastewater management services in the three regional centres of Mwanza, Iringa and Mbeya. Further funds of about €6.6 million were provided for the Mwanza Sewerage Rehabilitation Project between 2000 and 2004, whose aim was to prevent the overflow of raw sewage from Mwanza to Lake Victoria. Rural water and sanitation is supported through the EU general budget line for co-financing NGOs in developing countries.|$|E
25|$|Stoltenberg took an {{international}} role during {{the financial crisis}} by promoting international <b>financial</b> <b>cooperation.</b> This was among other arenas done through the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and a meeting in Chile 27–29 March 2009 where social democratic leaders {{from around the world}} met at a Progressive Governance Conference, just prior to the first G20 summit on the financial crisis. President Bill Clinton was among the delegates and panel that would chart {{a way out of the}} financial crisis, which included the host Michelle Bachelet, Britain's finance minister Gordon Brown, Brazil's President Lula da Silva and Stoltenberg. A special emergency meeting of the European Social Democratic Forum (PES) was gathered in Oslo in May 2011, on an initiative from Stoltenberg and the think tank Policy Network.|$|E

Direct exports from Switzerland to China account for 22.8 billion in that deal, which was heralded as a [...] "real milestone" [...] by then Swiss President Ueli Maurer. Switzerland has a positive trade balance with China, and both countries are expected to profit from export guarantees, protection of intellectual property and <b>financial</b> <b>cooperations</b> between their largest banks. Switzerland thus became the first continental European country and the largest economy to conclude a free trade deal with China.|$|R

25|$|However, in 1621, there arose {{circumstances}} {{that led to}} the success of the Galician aspirations. The monarchy needed the political and <b>financial</b> <b>cooperation</b> of their kingdoms in order to sustain their war efforts, following the end of twelve years of truce. The oligarchy and the Galician city councils were able to seize that occasion, and despite the resistance of Zamora, and the eagerness of other cities with exclusionary voting at the Courts, the Crown sacrificed political expediency for the sake of military necessity, and in 1623 the kingdom of Galicia regained the vote, dependent upon paying 100,000 ducats to build a navy to defend its own coastline. The influence of Diego Sarmiento de Acuña, Count Gondomar, was crucial to the success of this action, and Philip IV signed the resolution on October 13, 1623.|$|E
25|$|Germany {{supports}} {{access to}} water and sanitation in India through <b>financial</b> <b>cooperation</b> by KfW development bank and technical cooperation by GIZ. Since the early 1990s both institutions have supported watershed management in rural Maharashtra, using a participatory approach first piloted by the Social Center in Ahmednagar and that constituted a fundamental break with the previous top-down, technical approach to watershed management that had yielded little results. The involvement of women in decision-making {{is an essential part}} of the project. While the benefits are mostly in terms of increased agricultural production, the project also increases availability of water resources for rural water supply. In addition, GIZ actively supports the introduction of ecological sanitation concepts in India, including community toilets and decentralised wastewater systems for schools as well as small and medium enterprises. Many of these systems produce biogas from wastewater, provide fertiliser and irrigation water.|$|E
25|$|KfW {{is engaged}} in Nablus, Tulkarem, Salfit, Ramallah / Al-Bireh, Jenin and Gaza City. The water supply {{activities}} focus on the reduction of non-revenue water so that the available water resources can be used more efficiently. One successful example of water loss reduction is {{the first phase of}} the KfW-supported program in Nablus: the frequency of supply for 8,000 inhabitants in the Rafidia neighbourhood was increased from every 4 days to every 2–3 days. This was achieved by reducing distribution losses from 40% to currently 30%. Sanitation activities include the construction of sewer networks and wastewater treatment. The town of Al Bireh had the only functioning wastewater treatment plant in the West Bank in 2009. The plant, which was funded by KfW, was commissioned in 2000 and operates in a satisfactory way despite the challenging environment of the West Bank. The construction of wastewater treatment plants in Gaza City, Western Nablus, Salfeet and the Tulkarem region, however, was substantially delayed as of 2009. Until 2008 new <b>financial</b> <b>cooperation</b> commitments were granted in the form of projects that identified specific investments at an early stage. This approach changed in 2008 with the approval of a new KfW-supported water and sanitation program for the West Bank and Gaza. This program is open for proposals from small and medium-sized towns if they comply with certain selection criteria. The program’s main focus is on water loss reduction.|$|E
40|$|The {{financial}} and {{economic crisis in}} 1997 - 98 came as a dramatic shock to East Asian economies, and has prompted to institutionalize a regional <b>financial</b> and monetary <b>cooperation.</b> This paper demonstrates the strong will of East Asian countries to develop the regional <b>financial</b> and monetary <b>cooperation,</b> outlines recent developments, and provides possible prospects for the future. It {{points out that the}} option to keep consistent with the IMF system actually weakens regional solidarity, and recommends an immediate establishment of a strong regional surveillance and peer pressure mechanism for the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI) to evolve into a common pool of foreign exchange reserves, a sort of East Asian IMF. It also argues that East Asian countries should closely coordinate their exchange rate regime to maintain intra-regional and extra-regional exchange rate stability.

2500|$|Germany {{promotes}} sustainable sanitation {{through a}} wastewater management program that involves technical cooperation and <b>financial</b> <b>cooperation.</b> The program ran from 2005 to 2014. It has influenced the national {{regulatory framework for}} sanitation through waste water management Decree 88/2007 enacted by the Prime Minister and a corresponding circular enacted in 2009 by the Ministry of Construction. Furthermore, it supports Provincial People's Committees and wastewater companies in nine provinces through the elaboration of corporate development plans and the financing of sewers and wastewater treatment plants. [...] These are Lang Son, Son La, Hoa Binh, Bac Ninh and Hai Duong in the North, Vinh in the Centre, as well as Tra Vinh, Soc Trang and Can Tho in the Mekong Delta. In 2010 the province of Soc Trang has {{been the first to}} enact a sewer tariff that is designed to recover the costs of operation and maintenance. In 2012 Bac Ninh introduced a sewer tariff that is designed to recover half the operation and maintenance costs, with the aim of fully recovering them in 2014. The program also supports information campaigns to increase environmental and health awareness.|$|E

40|$|Many {{have argued}} that the major source of the {{existing}} global macroeconomic imbalances are the twin deficits of the United States (US). However, there is still a debate about whether the global imbalances indeed pose a significant threat to the world economy. This paper analyzes whether current efforts in East Asia in terms of <b>financial</b> and monetary <b>cooperation</b> and rebalancing of economic growth could significantly mitigate the adverse impacts of a global system that will still be dominated by the US dollar in the foreseeable future. It also explains why the People’s Republic of China is unlikely to make significant unilateral adjustments to reduce global macroeconomic imbalances. east asia; global macroeconomic imbalances; rebalancing economic growth; <b>financial</b> and monetary <b>cooperation...</b>|$|R
