Method of procedure The methods employed in this study were threefold: (1) a very thorough review of the current literature, (2) study of counselor certification requirements in the Southwest; namely, Arizona, California, New Mexico, Nevada, Texas, and Utah, and (3) an independent survey of school administrators employed in major cities within each of the above mentioned states.

40|$|Opioid-induced glial {{activation}} and its proinflammatory consequences {{have been}} associated with both reduced acute opioid analgesia and the enhanced development of tolerance, hyperalgesia and allodynia following chronic opioid administration. Intriguingly, recent evidence demonstrates that these effects can result independently from the activation of classical, stereoselective opioid receptors. Here, a structurally disparate range of opioids cause activation of signaling by the innate immune receptor toll like receptor 4 (TLR 4), resulting in proinflammatory glial activation. In the present series of studies, we demonstrate that the (+) -isomers of methadone and morphine, which bind with negligible affinity to classical opioid receptors, induced upregulation of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production in rat isolated dorsal spinal cord. Chronic intrathecal (+) -methadone produced hyperalgesia and allodynia, which were associated with significantly increased spinal glial activation (TLR 4 mRNA and protein) and the expression of multiple chemokines and cytokines. Statistical analysis suggests that a cluster of cytokines and chemokines may contribute to these nociceptive behavioral changes. Acute intrathecal (+) -methadone and (+) -morphine were also found to induce microglial, interleukin- 1 and TLR 4 /myeloid differentiation factor- 2 (MD- 2) dependent enhancement of pain responsivity. In silico docking analysis demonstrated (+) -naloxone sensitive docking of (+) -methadone and (+) -morphine to human MD- 2. Collectively, these data provide the first evidence of the pro-nociceptive consequences of small molecule xenobiotic activation of spinal TLR 4 signaling independent of classical opioid receptor involvement.

Progress in Physical Geography, 29 (3), 337 - 361 Lakes and reservoirs act as sinks for both catchment and atmospherically derived particulates and so their sediments can provide valuable information on temporal changes in these inputs. While {{the use of}} lake sediments as environmental archives is well established, reservoir sediments have less frequently been used as temporal records. Yet, for investigating pollution histories, reservoirs are ostensibly of greater interest: they are generally located close to urban and industrial sources of pollution and accumulate sediment rapidly and over similar time periods to major emissions of pollutants. The {{lack of interest in}} reservoir sediments stems from the perception that fluctuating water levels are likely to result in significant sediment disturbance. This perception is sustained, perhaps mistakenly, by a lack of research into reservoir sedimentary systems. There is, therefore, a need to review the available published research on reservoir sedimentation processes and patterns, the relatively few studies that have used reservoir sediments and relevant studies from the lake-sediment literature, and thus critically evaluate the potential and problems of using reservoir sediments as temporal records of pollution. Current understanding of the processes of sedimentation and resulting distributions are reviewed. Some significant differences between sedimentation in lakes and reservoirs are highlighted and the implications for sampling and interpretation of sedimentary records discussed. It is suggested that, at present, a valuable resource is being underutilized and it is demonstrated that, where sediment deposition patterns are taken into account, reservoir sedimentary records can provide important data for reconstructing past atmospheric and catchment pollutant inputs.

Naturalistically, dynamic coherence in pupillary change follows fluctuations in ambient light. Correspondingly, in social contexts discordant pupil response is likely to reflect divergence of dispositional state.

Journal of Paleolimnology, 35 (2), 305 - 322 Reservoir sediments {{are rarely}} used as {{environmental}} archives {{because of the}} potential for sediment disturbance by fluctuating water levels. However, rapid rates of sedimentation, proximity to urban centres and often the existence of management records, may make them potentially important resources for reconstructing recent, anthropogenically-derived environmental change. This project assesses the potential of reservoir sedimentary records for reconstructing past atmospheric and drainage basin fluxes of heavy metals (manganese, iron, nickel, copper, zinc and lead) in the southern Pennines, UK. Five reservoirs were {{selected on the basis of}} management history and drainage basin characteristics. Multi-parameter analysis showed sediments to be replicable across the ? 8 accumulating zone? with reasonably consistent rates of sedimentation. Water level fluctuations were not found to detrimentally affect sediment records in the deepwater area of the reservoirs. In fact, spheroidal carbonaceous particle (SCP) profiles show trends in inputs that closely reflect major changes in industrialisation, indicating the reservoir sediments to be excellent records of particulate inputs. Only lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) were significantly enriched in the reservoir sediment in comparison to background levels. Manganese (Mn), iron (Fe) and to a limited degree, copper (Cu), appeared to be affected by post-deposition mobility. Preliminary calculations of Pb fluxes indicate that over 80 % of the current Pb input to the reservoirs is from Pb deposited onto drainage basin soils in the past, rather than from direct atmospheric deposition or natural background inputs. In Howden reservoir, for example, the total Pb flux to deepwater sediment cores in 2000 was 119 mg m? 2 a? 1. Of this, an estimated 99 mg m? 2 a? 1 was from anthropogenically-derived Pb, initially deposited onto drainage basin soils and subsequently entering the reservoir via erosion and leaching processes. There is, therefore, no indication that the flux of Pb to the aquatic system is declining in response to reductions in Pb deposition. The ecotoxicological effects of the high and continuing Pb flux to these reservoirs, despite recent decreases in atmospheric deposition, is an area requiring further investigationPeer reviewe...|$|R
