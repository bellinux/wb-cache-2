She took a 9-6 lead against US fencer and World No.1 Rebecca Ward, but Ward levelled, before taking the {{advantage}} on 14-12. Besbes rallied to 14-all at the end of <b>fencing</b> <b>time.</b> The last hit required a lengthy video review and was finally given to Ward, who won the bout. Besbes incriminated a lack of support from the Tunisian Fencing Federation, which did not allow her to prepare correctly for an event of this magnitude.|$|E

In the 2012 London Olympics, he knocked out world No.4 Elmir Alimzhanov, then Jörg Fiedler, but was defeated after a tight bout against surprise semifinalist Bartosz Piasecki of Norway.

They were tied at 11 all at the end of <b>fencing</b> <b>time.</b> After two double hits, Jung struck a hit to come away with a bronze medal.|$|E
5000|$|Fencing bouts are timed: {{the clock}} is started every time the referee calls [...] "Fence" [...] and stopped every time he/she calls [...] "Halt!". The bout must stop after three minutes of fencing (or 8 touches in saber). In 15 point bouts, a 1-minute break occurs in between the three-minute intervals. If 9 minutes of <b>fencing</b> <b>time</b> elapse in a 15 touch bout, or 3 in a 5 touch bout, the bout is over and the current scores are taken as final. If the score is tied when time runs out then the {{director}} determines priority randomly. After priority is determined the fencers bout for one minute. If a point is scored, then that fencer wins, however if no points are scored then the fencer with priority wins. Note that this concept of priority {{is not the same}} as the priority used in foil and sabre to determine right-of-way.|$|E

40|$|The {{principle}} aim of {{this study}} was to determine whether fencing alone is a sufficient management tool for facilitating the recovery and persistence of indigenous flora in kahikatea-dominated forest patches in the Waikato region. The floral composition of twenty-six kahikatea-dominated forest patches of varied <b>fencing</b> <b>time,</b> management regime and proximity to an urban area (Hamilton City) were sampled using a modified RECCE method in 10 x 10 m quadrats between October 2007 and February 2008. Where woody weed species were present within a forest patch, their diameter at breast height (d. b. h) and reproductive status was noted (presence/absence of flowers and/or fruit). The results of the study demonstrate that, while fencing of a patch and time for native vegetation recovery are important factors in promoting native floral species recovery and ecosystem composition, the combination of patch size, distance of a patch from a main road, and patch location were better predictors of the observed variation in native species cover than <b>fencing</b> <b>time</b> alone; particularly in the layers most affected by grazing. This study indicates that patches less than seven hectares in area, regardless of location, will require continued human intervention to ensure their persistence; and patches in urban areas, irrespective of size, may never become self-sustaining. Furthermore, the results indicate that medium to low levels of management are the most effective in promoting native flora species recovery and reducing exotic species impacts. Fifteen to twenty years of fencing represents an important stage in the trajectory of a forest fragment where exotic species cover drops below 5 %, and native species recruitment is steadily rising. However, the trajectory of floristic change will be different for each patch depending on the length of time since fragmentation, the length of time it has been grazed, how far it is from native seed sources and its surrounding landscape use...|$|E

50|$|Bolton v Stone 1951 A cricket {{ball was}} hit {{out of the}} ground, over a fence 17 feet high, {{striking}} and injuring a passer-by.

40|$|Summary: The {{effect of}} {{protection}} from sheep grazing on indigenous plant species in relatively mesic, strongly modified Poa cita grassland, was examined using paired grazed and ungrazed sites. Ungrazed sites, <b>fenced</b> at <b>times</b> ranging {{from four to}} more than 24 years ago, had fewer species, lower indigenous cover and lower tussock density than adjacent grazed sites. The dominance of adventive species, particularly cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata), in ungrazed sites appeared to be important to these differences.
