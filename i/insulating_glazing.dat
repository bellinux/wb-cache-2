40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{optimize}} the building shape parameters and envelope parameters influencing the rural building energy consumption in cold winter and hot summer climate. Several typical models are established and optimized by integrated TRNSYS and GenOpt. Single-objective optimization has provided guidance to the multi-dimensional optimization. Building shape and envelope parameters are considered simultaneously by multi-dimensional optimization. Results of the optimization showed significant reduction in terms of EC (energy consumption). When O (building orientation) was SW (south by west) 10 °, LWR (length-width ratio) was 1. 1, WWRS (window-wall ratio in south) with the range of 0. 6 – 0. 8, ITE (insulation thickness of exterior wall) and ITR (insulation thickness of roof) was 0. 05 m and 0. 08 m respectively, the building had minimal energy consumption. The results also indicated that the optimal EWT (exterior window type) was plastic single-frame Low-E <b>insulating</b> <b>glazing</b> filled with inert gas, and the optimal shape of building is Re (rectangle).

40|$|The {{development}} of vacuum glazing represents a significant advancement {{in the area}} of low heat loss glazing systems with the potential to substantially reduce building heating and cooling loads. Vacuum glazing consists of two or more glass panes hermetically sealed together around the edge with a vacuum gap between the panes. To avoid the glass panes from collapsing and touching each other under the influence of atmospheric pressure an array of support pillars is provided between the glass panes. A high level of thermal insulation is achieved by evacuating the spaces between the glass panes to a very low pressure which greatly reduces conduction and convection within the space; therefore heat transfer through this kind of glazing is significantly lower when compared with conventional <b>insulating</b> <b>glazing.</b> However, vacuum glazing is subject to inherent stresses due to atmospheric pressure and temperature differentials which can lead to fracture of the glass panes and failure of the edge seal. A flexible edge seal has been proposed to minimise the impact of these issues. In this paper, vacuum glazing system with rigid and flexible edge seals is theoretically studied and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed...|$|E

40|$|The energy {{performance}} of a window depends on its thermal transmittance, the glazing solar transmittance, and the air leakage due to the frame and installation airtightness. In new installations air leakage represents a quite small term which is almost independent {{from the window and}} in particular from the glazing system selection. The contributions of the two other terms to the building thermal balance are not independent to each other: the most effective thermal <b>insulating</b> <b>glazing,</b> as triple glazings, are generally characterized by low solar transmittance reducing solar gains. The thermal energy balance of the building is then affected not only in summer but also in winter, potentially increasing heating energy need. This work evaluates the impact of different kinds of glazing systems (two double and two triple glazings), window size (from 16 % to 41 % of window to floor area ratio), orientation of the main windowed façade and internal gains on winter and summer energy need and peak loads of a well insulated residential building. The climatic data of four localities of central and southern Europe have been considered: Paris, Milan, Nice and Rome.

40|$|The {{market share}} of triple heat <b>insulating</b> <b>glazing</b> has been {{increasing}} to ~ 60 % by now in Germany. Dew and frost on the outside surface of such insulating glass units with U g values from 0. 4 to 1. 0 W/m 2 K installed as window glazing are a severe problem, because the free look-through {{being one of the}} essential functions of glazing is disturbed. This report describes the kay parameters influencing the occurrence. Therefore a realistic model of the stationary heat flow through glazing is established. From this parameter study it follows that frost can be avoided by adequate Low-E, but this does not hold for dew. Regarding dew, only the frequency of its occurrence can be diminished. The essential result of the study is that dew on the outside surface of glazing cannot be avoided with any Low-E coating if the outdoor temperature exceeds the room temperature. With Low-E coatings having a maximum emissivity epsilon 0 = 0. 2 marketed today frost can be avoided on the outside surface of all vertically installed glazing with U g greater-than-or-equal 0. 6 W/m 2 K and on the outside of skylight glazing with U g greater-than-or-equal 0. 75 W/m 2 K...|$|E

The {{durability}} of such a unit depends on {{the resistance of the}} glass itself, the unit's edge sealing system and the light-deflecting system against the environmental loads acting upon the glazing unit, when installed as a translucent roof element in the building. To verify the durability of the edge seal and of the solar reflectivity of the light-deflecting system factory-made samples of the glazing units, mostly with original dimensions, were exposed to alternating and constant hygrothermal loads. This included different ambient temperatures and humidity conditions {{on both sides of the}} units as well as exposure to artifical sunlight. For the evaluation of the test results the experience with standard tests on <b>insulating</b> <b>glazing</b> systems served as a basis. Thermal transmittance, total energy transmittance, light transmission, adhesion of the sealants and diffusion resistance of the sealants used at the glass edge, gas content and dew point temperatures of the gas in the gap between the glass panes, moisture content of the drying agent in the spacer, temperature resistance of the light deflection system, linear expansion of the deflection system and thickness changes of the gap between the panes were considered.

40|$|The {{market share}} of {{thermally}} insulating, triple glazing installed as window glazing increased to nearly 50 % in Germany in 2011 and is continuing to rise in 2012. Dew and frost on the outdoor surface of <b>insulating</b> <b>glazing</b> units with thermal transmittance values U-g below 1. 0 W/(m(2) K) present a severe problem, because unimpeded visual contact, one of the essential features of glazing, is disturbed. The report describes calculation methods to determine the occurrence and prevention of outdoor condensation and the key parameters influencing it. From this parameter study, it follows that condensation on the outdoor surface of window glazing {{in the form of}} frost and dew is prevented for all the glazing by low-emissivity (low-e) coatings with a certain thermal emissivity value epsilon(o) between 0 and 1 on the outdoor surface if the outdoor air temperature t(o) is lower than the room temperature t(i), normally given for buildings in the Central European climate when outdoor condensation occurs. However, today weather resistant low-e coatings with sufficient transmittance applied on outdoor surfaces of window glazing can only be manufactured on the basis of indium tin oxide with epsilon(o) approximate to 0. 2. The study shows that with such low-e coatings frost can be prevented as well as the frequency of dew occurrence can be reduced on all vertically installed glazing with thermal transmittance values U-g >= 0. 47 W/(m(2) K) and on the outside of skylight glazing with U-g >= 0. 70 W/(m(2) K). This is sufficient for all window glazing marketed nowadays. Weather-resistant, cost-effective coatings on glass with epsilon(o) < 0. 2, which are required for energy-neutral glazing with U-g values < 0. 5 W/(m(2) K), are the subject of ongoing development...|$|E

Two-dimensional laminar perpendicular forced convection over an outdoor fenestration surface was also numerically modeled in order to obtain more realistic convective heat transfer coefficient to be used as an outdoor convective boundary condition from the numerical model of the fenestration system. ^ 2 -D numerical modeling of the combined convective and radiative heat transfer in a glazing cavity, occurring simultaneously with conduction heat transfer in the solid sections of fenestration system (i. e. glazing panes, wood frame, sealant and spacer), were performed for several different sets of external (indoor and outdoor) boundary conditions.

Comparisons were made with the results of two-dimensional numerical modeling and corrections for existing two-dimensional models are recommended. ...|$|E

Microstructured prismatic window films can be manufactured using low-cost, roll-to-roll fabrication methods and adhered to the inside surface of existing windows as a retrofit measure or installed as a replacement insulating glass unit in the clerestory portion of the window wall. A clear film patterned with linear, 50 - 250 micrometer high, four-sided asymmetrical prisms was fabricated and installed in the south-facing, clerestory low-e, clear glazed windows of a full-scale testbed facility. Views through the film were distorted. The film was evaluated in a sunny climate over a two-year period to gauge daylighting and visual comfort performance. The daylighting aperture was small (window-towall ratio of 0. 18) and the lower windows were blocked off to isolate the evaluation to the window film. Workplane illuminance measurements were made in the 4. 6 m (15 ft) deep room furnished as a private office. Analysis of discomfort glare was conducted using high dynamic range imaging coupled with the evalglare software tool, which computes the daylight glare probability and other metrics used to evaluate visual discomfort. The window film was found to result in perceptible levels of discomfort glare on clear sunny days from the most conservative view point {{in the rear of the}} room looking toward the window. Daylight illuminance levels at the rear of the room were significantly increased above the reference window condition, which was defined as the same glazed clerestory window but with an interior Venetian blind (slat angle set to the cut-off angle), for the equinox to winter solstice period on clear sunny days. For partly cloudy and overcast sky conditions, daylight levels were improved slightly. To reduce glare, the daylighting film was coupled with a diffusing film in an <b>insulating</b> <b>glazing</b> unit. The diffusing film retained the directionality of the redirected light spreading it within a small range of outgoing angles.

40|$|This report {{could be}} used as a {{guideline}} for building owners on the possible risks and benefits of various energy retrofit options available to them. There are also best-practice examples provided which show projects of retrofitting and what should be considered and how the improvements can be implemented. Potential risks for retrofitting will be addressed in detail; most of them are related to: - Thermal bridges; - Moisture damages; - Uncertain cost calculation; - Improvement on ventilation (airflow, efficiency, thermal comfort). The advantages can be summarized as: - Increased living thermal comfort (indoor climate); - Use of existing building structure; - Cost savings for heating energy. These aspects are illustrated from different views of the Annex 55 participating countries. Most of the contributing countries are located in Europe: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Great Britain, The Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia and Sweden; while three countries are from North-/ South- America: Brazil, Canada and the USA The energy consumption for the space conditioning of buildings can be reduced by the appropriate combination of several measures: - insulation of components: roof, wall and floor, - application of <b>insulating</b> <b>glazing</b> - airtightness of buildings, - orientation of buildings and rooms for the use of passive solar energy, (not a retrofit option) - use of an efficient and environment-friendly heating system, - installation of comfortable and efficient ventilation, - use of renewable energy as heating support, -use of heat pumps as heating support, - solar shading to avoid overheating in dwellings. Several studies have shown that the most efficient way to curb the energy consumption in the residential building sector (new & existing) remain the reduction of the heat loss by improving the insulation of the building envelope (roof, floor, wall & windows). Thermal insulation (combined with the application of high performance windows) holds a key position among these measures, which lay the foundation of low-energy building. The basic rules for low-energy building are - the reduction of energy demand and - production of the remaining demand more effectively and preferably - from renewable sources. The chapters of this report are organized by country to quickly guide the reader to find information which is relevant for to the reader or to inform about the statistics of other countries. In the end of each chapter, there is a compilation and overview of all countries, which summarizes the overall similarities and trends and points out major differences. Chapter 2 provides an overview of the energy consumption in residential buildings. This chapter should help to estimate the total effort and potential for each country in general. Chapter 3 covers the national regulation standards in order to provide the designer a scheme where to look for relevant standards and general references. The national regulations are birefly summarized and the most important information is highlighted. Chapter 4 highlights the most important data which should be considered when building new residential buildings or retrofit existing ones. Mainly thermal transmittances of the envelope, thermal bridges and ventilation regulations are addressed. Chapter 5 lists questions regarding testing of retrofitting. This might be relevant for building owners and architects or manufactures. Chapter 6 is divided into retrofitting certain building envelope parts. Contributing countries present typical examples of retrofitting including their risks and benefits from a national perspective. In addition, further local examples and references can be found in chapter 7.
