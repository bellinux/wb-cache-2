5|$|Though {{considered}} to be quick-firing, the propellant for 7-inch guns was loaded in bags, making them slower than contemporary 6-inch guns. The Navy considered these to be <b>excellent</b> <b>for</b> the intended role; however, in World War I North Atlantic convoy duty, the disadvantages in seakeeping outweighed the utility; they were removed from battleships remaining in US service in 1918.|$|E
5|$|Mineral ores can be mined {{just like}} normal stone and the raw ore can be smelted to produce their {{corresponding}} metal bars. Different ores or metal bars can be alloyed together for higher quality materials. For steel production, flux stones {{are used to}} make pig iron bars and smelt it with regular iron and coal (or charcoal). Specific metal items can be melted back to their respective bars. Without steel, the alloy bronze or regular iron are the next best suitable metals to use. Bronze requires two ores or bars of tin and copper. The metal adamantine, found deep below, is extremely light but very strong, making it <b>excellent</b> <b>for</b> sharp weapons and armor. Raw adamantine can be extracted into strands and can further be either woven in cloth or smelted into wafers.|$|E
5|$|The {{battles of}} zduhaći were furious. They were {{accompanied}} by forceful gales and whirlwinds which uprooted trees and whipped up dust. In Montenegro, it was considered dangerous to throw stones in the wind, because that might knock out an eye of a zduhać, who would kill the culprit. A fighting zduhać was supposed to retain his peck measure and milk bucket, while trying to seize these objects from an enemy zduhać; he should hit and not get hit. The victorious band of zduhaći would loot the yield of all agricultural produce from the territory of their defeated foes. The harvest in the coming season would thus be <b>excellent</b> <b>for</b> the victors and poor for the defeated zduhaći.|$|E

5|$|The new work, {{like its}} predecessor, {{attracted}} minimal readership. On 21 June 1791, {{just days after}} it was published, all attention became focused on King Louis XVI's ill-fated flight to Varennes, and Saint-Just's theories about constitutional monarchy were made suddenly irrelevant. Yet the episode had another effect – it fostered a public anger toward the king which simmered all year until finally a Parisian mob attacked the Tuileries Palace on 10 August 1792. In response, the Assembly declared itself ready to step down ahead of schedule {{and called for a}} new election, this one under universal male suffrage. The timing was <b>excellent</b> <b>for</b> Saint-Just, who turned the legal age of twenty-five {{before the end of the}} month. The fear inspired by the invasion of the Tuileries made most of his opponents retire from the scene, and Saint-Just was elected as one of the deputies for the département of Aisne. He left for Paris to join the National Convention as its youngest member.|$|E

25|$|A good nanovector for siRNA {{delivery}} should protect siRNA from degradation, enrich siRNA in {{the target}} organ and facilitate the cellular uptake of siRNA. The three main groups of siRNA nanovectors are: lipid based, non-lipid organic-based, and inorganic. Lipid based nanovectors are <b>excellent</b> <b>for</b> delivering siRNA to solid tumors, but other cancers may require different non-lipid based organic nanovectors such as cyclodextrin based nanoparticles.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a strong}} {{relationship}} between the properties of wood and {{the properties of the}} particular tree that yielded it. The density of wood varies with species. The density of a wood correlates with its strength (mechanical properties). For example, mahogany is a medium-dense hardwood that is <b>excellent</b> <b>for</b> fine furniture crafting, whereas balsa is light, making it useful for model building. One of the densest woods is black ironwood.|$|E

25|$|Much of {{the early}} European {{exploration}} and trade of Canada {{was based on the}} quest for beaver. The most valuable part of the beaver is its inner fur whose many minute barbs make it <b>excellent</b> <b>for</b> felting, especially for hats. In Canada a 'made beaver' or castor gras that a native had worn or slept on was more valuable than a fresh skin since this tended to wear off the outer guard hairs.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the mineral}} classes {{detected}} may have formed in environments suitable (i.e., enough {{water and the}} proper pH) for life. The mineral smectite (a phyllosilicate) forms in near-neutral waters. Phyllosilicates and carbonates are good for preserving organic matter, so they may contain evidence of past life. Sulfate deposits preserve chemical and morphological fossils, and fossils of microorganisms form in iron oxides like hematite. The presence of opaline silica points toward a hydrothermal environment that could support life. Silica is also <b>excellent</b> <b>for</b> preserving evidence of microbes.|$|E
25|$|A small, light fighter, its {{low wing}} {{loadings}} were <b>excellent</b> <b>for</b> air combat maneuvering and its small size {{made it difficult}} to spot even when its adversary was warned of its presence. Typically, the MiG-21 was used in hit-and-run tactics; being vectored by Ground Control Intercept (GCI) to an intercept position to the vulnerable rear of an American strike formation, then executing a missile attack and diving away before fighter cover could intervene. Scoring its first kill on October 5, 1966, in December intercepting MiG-21s shot down two F-105s and forced 20% of all strike sorties to jettison their bombloads.|$|E

25|$|The main French (and Israeli) battle tank, the AMX-13, was {{designed}} for mobile, outflanking operations, {{which led to a}} tank that was lightly armoured but very fast. General André Beaufre, who served as Stockwell's subordinate, favoured a swift campaign of movement in which the main objective was to encircle the enemy. Throughout the operation, Beaufre proved himself to be more aggressive than his British counterparts, always urging that some bold step be taken at once. The French Navy had a powerful carrier force which was <b>excellent</b> <b>for</b> projecting power inland, but, like its British counterpart, suffered from a lack of landing craft.|$|E
25|$|CT is {{only able}} to detect 76% of hollow viscous {{injuries}} and patients who have negative scans must often be observed and rechecked if they deteriorate. However, CT has been demonstrated to be useful in screening patients with certain forms of abdominal trauma {{in order to avoid}} unnecessary laparotomies, which can significantly increase the cost and length of hospitalizations. A meta-analysis of CT use in penetrating abdominal traumas demonstrated sensitivity, specificity and accuracy >= 95%, with a PPV of 85% and an NPV of 98%. This suggests that CT is <b>excellent</b> <b>for</b> avoiding unnecessary laparotomies but must be augmented by other clinical criteria to determine the need for surgical exploration (23.37 positive likelihood ratio, 0.05 negative likelihood ratio).|$|E
25|$|In 1977, Hughes-Games {{described}} the first practical marine fish/shellfish/phytoplankton culture, followed by Gordin, et al., in 1981. By 1989, a semi-intensive (1kg fish/m−3) seabream and grey mullet pond system by the Gulf of Aqaba (Eilat) on the Red Sea supported dense diatom populations, <b>excellent</b> <b>for</b> feeding oysters. Hundreds of kilos {{of fish and}} oysters cultured here were sold. Researchers also quantified the water quality parameters and nutrient budgets in (5kg fish m−3) green water seabream ponds. The phytoplankton generally maintained reasonable water quality and converted on average over half the waste nitrogen into algal biomass. Experiments with intensive bivalve cultures yielded high bivalve growth rates. This technology supported a small farm in southern Israel.|$|E
