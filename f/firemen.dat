5|$|Striking <b>firemen</b> delayed Havanas {{departure}} in July 1911. The <b>firemen</b> {{were looking}} for an additional $0.15 per day for meals while the ship was in port. A. G. Smith, General Manager of the Ward Line, agreed to that concession, allowing the Havana to get underway after a two-hour delay.|$|E
5|$|The {{fire station}} {{contained}} flats for 32 <b>firemen</b> {{and their families}} and 6 single <b>firemen.</b> Facilities included a laundry, gym, billiards room and children's play-areas. The complex contained stables for the horses that pulled the fire appliances, and a blacksmith's workshop. There were electric bells and lights to alert <b>firemen</b> to an alarm, poles to expedite the firemen's response, suspended harnesses to allow the horses to be harnessed quickly, and electric doors. The fire station was also designed with foresight; the appliance bays were made wide enough to take motorised fire appliances. The station's first motorised fire appliance arrived in 1911, five years after it opened.|$|E
5|$|On 19 March 1828, {{the boiler}} of {{locomotive}} No. 5 exploded at Simpasture Junction. One {{of the two}} <b>firemen</b> was killed, the other severely scalded. The driver (George Stephenson's older brother) was unharmed.|$|E
5|$|At 9:30pm Sgt David Pengelly led {{the unit}} into Broadwater Farm to protect <b>firemen</b> who had earlier been {{forced out of}} the estate's Tangmere block, where a fire had started in the Centra Supermarket on the first floor.|$|E
5|$|Despite an {{extremely}} tight budget, production supervisor Luigi Giacosi {{was able to}} rent a small circus run {{by a man named}} Savitri, a strongman and fire-eater who coached Quinn on circus jargon and the technical aspects of chain-breaking. Giacosi also secured the services of the Zamperla Circus, which supplied a number of stuntmen who could play themselves, including Basehart's double, a high-wire artist who refused to perform when <b>firemen</b> arrived with a safety net.|$|E
5|$|In {{boiler room}} No.4, at around 01:20, water began {{flooding}} in from below, possibly {{indicating that the}} bottom of the ship had also been holed by the iceberg. The flow of water soon overwhelmed the pumps and forced the <b>firemen</b> and trimmers to evacuate the forward boiler rooms. Further aft, Chief Engineer William Bell, his engineering colleagues, and a handful of volunteer <b>firemen</b> and greasers stayed behind in the unflooded No.1, 2 and 3 boiler rooms and in the turbine and reciprocating engine rooms. They continued working on the boilers and the electrical generators {{in order to keep the}} ship's lights and pumps operable and to power the radio so that distress signals could be sent. They remained at their posts until the very end, thus ensuring that Titanics electrics functioned until the final minutes of the sinking. None of the ship's 35 engineers and electricians survived. Neither did any of the Titanics five postal clerks, who were last seen struggling to save the mail bags they had rescued from the flooded mail room. They were caught by the rising water somewhere on D deck.|$|E
5|$|Mayor McKune met on July 27 {{with representatives}} of the Brotherhood of Trainmen. Following a meeting of the railway strikers, the <b>firemen</b> and brakemen agreed to return to work at their {{previous}} wages. Shortly thereafter, the mill workers returned to work, with assurances from W. W. Scranton. The miners, however, denounced the concession and resolved to continue the strike.|$|E
5|$|Most workers {{accepted}} {{the reduction in}} pay, but the <b>firemen</b> and those who ran the freight trains resolved to stop work in protest. However, the number of unemployed along the line was so great, owing to the ongoing economic problems, {{that the company had}} no difficulty replacing the absent strikers. In response, the strikers resolved to occupy portions of the rail line, and to stop trains from passing unless the company rescinded the wage cuts.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{meetings}} and conferences of discontented workers continued across the country. A committee representing the strikers (including engineers, conductors, <b>firemen,</b> and brakemen) departed Baltimore to ensure solidarity along the line in demanding $2 per hour. According to the edition of July 20 of The Sun, the city was peaceful, but anxious, as many awaited word of the happenings in Martinsburg, which {{was seen as the}} central point of the movement.|$|E
5|$|On July 25 The New York Times {{reported}} that a general strike {{had taken place in}} Scranton. A committee representing the miners called a meeting with W. R. Storrs, coal superintendent. They demanded higher wages, and vowed not to return to work, even if the railroad workers abandoned their strike. The brakemen, <b>firemen</b> and others joined, and every industry in the city was halted {{with the exception of the}} Pennsylvania Coal Company.|$|E
5|$|The August 26, 1977 ABC Evening News {{covered the}} story of a major fire at the embassy. Despite the {{severity}} of the fire, all personnel were evacuated safely, and the efforts of the embassy staff elicited a commendation from President Jimmy Carter. Former KGB agent Victor Sheymov testified before Congress in 1998 that the fire was deliberately induced by the Soviets in an effort to gain access to sensitive areas by agents posing as <b>firemen.</b>|$|E
5|$|The central siren {{is located}} at the Briarcliff Manor Village Hall. Since the 1950s, {{additional}} sirens have been located on Schrade Road and at the intersection of Long Hill and Scarborough roads. <b>Firemen</b> also are issued small radio receivers to send a signal of a fire's location and which trucks should be sent. Company officers additionally have two-way radios.|$|E
5|$|To {{strengthen}} the city's firefighting capabilities, the city established a reserve unit called the Exempt Fireman's Company, so called {{because it was}} made up of <b>firemen</b> who were exempt from militia and jury duty. The company was led by veteran fireman Zophar Mills, who had helped stop the great 1835 fire from crossing Wall Street.|$|E
5|$|When Engine Co. 22 arrived, it {{was ordered}} to pump water on the {{warehouse}}. The company's firefighters entered the warehouse and dragged a hose up a staircase to direct water onto the fourth floor. When heavy black smoke began coming down the stairway, Foreman Garrett B. Lane ordered his <b>firemen</b> to evacuate. Fireman Francis Hart, Jr., became trapped while trying to collect the hose {{and was forced to}} flee to the roof and escape over neighboring rooftops.|$|E
5|$|After {{dismissing the}} idea of taking Simpson family home videos and a geode, Bart brings Santa's Little Helper to school for show and tell. Even though his show-and-tell {{presentation}} is well received by the class, the dog escapes into the school air ducts to follow the food scent coming from the kitchen and is spotted by Ralph. Groundskeeper Willie is sent after the dog and catches it, but he chooses the wrong vent to exit and the fire department is called in to rescue him. As the <b>firemen</b> are attempting to rescue Willie, an outraged Superintendent Chalmers appears and fires Principal Skinner, much to Bart's shock.|$|E
5|$|Braidwood {{regarded}} Westminster Hall as {{safe from}} destruction by 1:45am, {{partly because of}} the actions of the floating fire engine, but also because a change {{in the direction of the}} wind kept the flames away from the Hall. Once the crowd realised that the hall was safe they began to disperse, and had left by around 3:00am, by which time the fire near the Hall was nearly out, although it continued to burn towards the south of the complex. The <b>firemen</b> remained in place until about 5:00am, when they had extinguished the last remaining flames and the police and soldiers had been replaced by new shifts.|$|E
5|$|Debs {{had joined}} the Brotherhood of Locomotive <b>Firemen</b> (BLF) in February 1875 and became active in the organization. In 1877 {{he served as a}} {{delegate}} of the Terre Haute lodge to the organization's national convention. Debs was elected associate editor of the BLF's monthly organ, Firemen's Magazine, in 1878. Two years later, he was appointed Grand Secretary and Treasurer of the BLF and editor of the magazine in July 1880. He worked as a BLF functionary until January 1893 and as the magazine's editor until September 1894.|$|E
5|$|Experimental {{electric}} fire-engines {{were made}} for testing in France, Germany and England starting {{in the latter part}} of the nineteenth century. Siemens Brothers Company of London built and experimented with an electric fire engine in 1891. It was shown at the Royal Naval Exhibition in England in 1892. The Paris Fire Department experimented with a self-propelled electric fire engine in 1899. The French electric fire engine, known to them as the automobile pump, was first exhibited at the 1900 World's Fair in Paris and became very popular during its first six months of successful operation. It was demonstrated that this electric fire-engine allowed <b>firemen</b> to begin to extinguish a fire four minutes earlier than a steam fire engine. The fire-engine was self-propelled by on board batteries, and carried a water tank with hundreds of gallons of water that could be used immediately at the site of the fire. The hoses were then connected to the city fire hydrants for more water if needed for a large fire. In 1901, the Paris Fire Department put an electric fire engine into successful operation that also had a hook-and-ladder wagon. It had an electric motor-driven water pump to which hoses were attached for the <b>firemen</b> to use.|$|E
5|$|Firefighters {{from the}} Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY), {{at that time}} a {{volunteer}} organization, arrived {{under the command of}} Chief Engineer Cornelius Anderson. As the fire grew, the FDNY personnel were joined by retired fire chiefs from the city and firefighting crews from Brooklyn, Newark, and Williamsburg. <b>Firemen</b> battling the blaze were aided by water flowing from the Croton Aqueduct, which had been completed in 1842. The fire either weakened in intensity or had been subdued by firefighters by 1:00 p.m. that day.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm, 2,100police and <b>firemen</b> dug furiously through mud {{and debris}} {{in search of}} the missing. The name Bess was {{previously}} retired in 1974 and replaced with Bonnie. However, when the list of typhoon names was changed to incorporate male names in 1979, the name was re-introduced to the roster. After this usage of the name Bess, it was retired for the second time and was replaced with Brenda. This marked the only occasion where a single name was removed twice in the same basin.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the {{department}} ordered a rescue truck for $194,448 ($ today) from 3-D Manufacturing, and a Pierce pumper truck was purchased at $312,777 ($ today) for Scarborough to replace their corroding 1974 Mack truck. A year later, {{the department}} hosted the Westchester County Volunteer <b>Firemen</b> Association Convention, the usual parade with 43 departments, a golf outing, {{and the annual}} meeting and dinner of the Association. During the September 11 attacks in 2001, the department sent some of its engines to the Bronx to cover for units that had left for the World Trade Center.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to a fire station, the building housed a police station, an ambulance station, a bank, a coroner's court, and a gas-meter testing station. The fire station operated for eighty years, housing the <b>firemen,</b> their families, and the horse-drawn appliances that were replaced by motorised vehicles {{a few years after}} its opening. It was visited by royalty in 1942, in recognition of the brigade's wartime efforts. After the war it became a training centre and in 1952 became the first centre equipped to record emergency calls. However, the fire station became expensive to maintain and after council reorganisation decline set in.|$|E
5|$|On November 23, 1957, tragedy struck {{when the}} Lathrop Building caught on fire. <b>Firemen</b> {{rushed to the}} scene {{to put out the}} blaze and did so quickly, but not before the {{television}} and radio studios on the top floors of the building were destroyed. The News-Miner offices and printing facilities on the lower floors were spared from the flames, but suffered water damage. Due to winter temperatures, the water soon froze. Despite the conditions, the paper was produced on time the next day.|$|E
5|$|The Chicago Union Stock Yards Fire {{started on}} December 22, 1910, {{destroying}} $400,000 {{of property and}} killing twenty-one <b>firemen,</b> including the Fire Marshal James J. Horan. Fifty engine companies and seven hook and ladder companies fought the fire until it was declared extinguished by Chief Seyferlich on December 23. In 2004, a memorial to all Chicago firefighters who {{have died in the}} line of duty was erected just behind the Union Stock Yards Gate at the intersection of Exchange Avenue and Peoria Street.|$|E
5|$|The London Fire Engine Establishment (LFEE)—an {{organisation}} run {{by several}} insurance {{companies in the}} absence of a publicly run brigade—was alerted at about 7:00pm, by which time the fire had spread from the House of Lords. The head of the LFEE, James Braidwood, brought with him 12 engines and 64 <b>firemen,</b> even though the Palace of Westminster was a collection of uninsured government buildings, and therefore fell outside the protection of the LFEE. Some of the firefighters ran their hoses down to the Thames. The river was at low tide and it meant a poor supply of water for the engines on the river side of the building.|$|E
5|$|The {{fire spread}} {{quickly in the}} high wind and, by mid-morning on Sunday, people {{abandoned}} attempts at extinguishing it and fled. The moving human mass and their bundles and carts made the lanes impassable for <b>firemen</b> and carriages. Pepys took a coach back into the city from Whitehall, but only reached St Paul's Cathedral before {{he had to get}} out and walk. Pedestrians with handcarts and goods were still on the move away from the fire, heavily weighed down. The parish churches not directly threatened were filling up with furniture and valuables, which soon had to be moved further afield.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{commanded}} by 62-year-old Captain Edward John Smith, {{the most senior}} of the White Star Line's captains. He had four decades of seafaring experience and had served as captain of , from which he was transferred to command Titanic. The {{vast majority of the}} crew who served under him were not trained sailors, but were either engineers, <b>firemen,</b> or stokers, responsible for looking after the engines; or stewards and galley staff, responsible for the passengers. The 6watch officers and 39able-bodied seamen constituted only around 5percent of the crew, and most of these had been taken on at Southampton so had not had time to familiarise themselves with the ship.|$|E
5|$|They are {{captured}} by the gangster Bully Bull the anthropomorphised bulldog, and although they escape once, he recaptures them, before Bluebell kicks him so hard that he flies {{into the air and}} lands in Santa Barbara, where he is found and imprisoned by a sheriff. While Popol, Virginia, and Bluebell manage to make their way across a deep ravine, Bully Bull escapes from jail, and attacks Popol on a steep face. All of them fall down the cliff, but are rescued by <b>firemen</b> with a trampoline, and Bully Bull is once more apprehended.|$|E
5|$|Early in his {{political}} career, Debs {{was a member}} of the Democratic Party. He was elected as a Democrat to the Indiana General Assembly in 1884. After working with several smaller unions, including the Brotherhood of Locomotive <b>Firemen,</b> Debs was instrumental in the founding of the American Railway Union (ARU), one of the nation's first industrial unions. After workers at the Pullman Palace Car Company organized a wildcat strike over pay cuts in the summer of 1894, Debs signed many into the ARU. He called a boycott of the ARU against handling trains with Pullman cars, in what became the nationwide Pullman Strike, affecting most lines west of Detroit, and more than 250,000 workers in 27 states. To keep the mail running, President Grover Cleveland used the United States Army to break the strike. As a leader of the ARU, Debs was convicted of federal charges for defying a court injunction against the strike and served six months in prison.|$|E
5|$|Flooding {{damage was}} also {{reported}} to infrastructure other than roads. After two rivers overflowed, at least 70% of Oxford was flooded, {{which included a}} hardware store and dozens of homes, while a senior citizens living complex were evacuated. The SOS Children's Village in Margaretsville sustained approximately $25,000 (1999CAD) in flood damage. Schools in Amherst and the University of Windsor canceled afternoon classes on September24. In the Canning area, 1,500people were left without power, while electricity was also lost in Annapolis Valley, Yarmouth, Truro, Westville, Amherst, and Stellarton. A woman required rescue by <b>firemen</b> after her van plunged into the swollen River Philip. In Maccan, a tractor trailer loaded with lumber went off the road. Damage in Nova Scotia likely exceeded $5million (1999CAD).|$|E
5|$|In 1800 he {{was still}} doing {{engineering}} work for his former employers, who were beset with manufacturing problems and a shortage of engine-erectors. He was also running his own business engaged in general millwrighting and was still called upon by various Manchester engine owners who preferred to use his services for their machine erection and maintenance needs than those of Boulton and Watt. He had moved to New Street, Hanover Street and in December 1799 {{was appointed to the}} position of conductor of <b>firemen</b> and inspector of engines by the Manchester police commissioners, positions which effectively put him in charge of the fire brigade. One source– the one considered unreliable by Chaloner– has stated that he had held the position for 20 years prior to his death.|$|E
5|$|In {{those areas}} which the Red Army had {{captured}} {{and before the}} fighting in {{the centre of the}} city had stopped, the Soviet authorities took measures to start restoring essential services. Almost all transport {{in and out of the}} city had been rendered inoperative, and bombed-out sewers had contaminated the city's water supplies. The Soviet authorities appointed local Germans to head each city block, and organised the cleaning-up. The Red Army made a major effort to feed the residents of the city. Most Germans, both soldiers and civilians, were grateful to receive food issued at Red Army soup kitchens which began on Colonel-General Nikolai Berzarin's orders. After the capitulation the Soviets went house to house, arresting and imprisoning anyone in a uniform including <b>firemen</b> and railwaymen.|$|E
5|$|Rescue efforts began {{immediately}} after the crash. Almost all the successful rescues of survivors occurred within {{half an hour of}} the impact. Initially, rescue efforts were led by the military and civilian employees within the building. Within minutes, the first fire companies arrived and found these volunteers searching near the impact site. The <b>firemen</b> ordered them to leave as they were not properly equipped or trained to deal with the hazards. The Arlington County Fire Department (ACFD) assumed command of the immediate rescue operation within 10minutes of the crash. ACFD Assistant Chief James Schwartz implemented an incident command system (ICS) to coordinate response efforts among multiple agencies. It took about an hour for the ICS structure to become fully operational. Firefighters from Fort Myer and Reagan National Airport arrived within minutes. Rescue and firefighting efforts were impeded by rumors of additional incoming planes. Chief Schwartz ordered two evacuations during the day in response to these rumors.|$|E
5|$|The radical faction around Nicolae Bălcescu and Gheorghe Magheru {{had planned}} {{resistance}} on the Danube, but their opinion {{had failed to}} rally significant appeal. A group of several thousands soldiers, comprising Oltenian pandurs and volunteers from throughout the land, rallied in Râmnicu Vâlcea under Magheru's command, without ever going into action. In Bucharest itself, as Fuat prepared to lead his 6000 troops into the garrison on Dealul Spirii, a 900-strong force led by a detachment of <b>firemen</b> met him with resistance, provoking a brief battle that only lasted {{two and a half}} hours during which 158 Turks and 48 Romanians died and 400 Turks and 57 Romanians were wounded. In the evening, the entire city had been pacified. On September 27, a Russian force under Alexander von Lüders joined the occupation of Bucharest, taking over administration over one half of the city. Russia's expedition into the two Danubian Principalities was the only independent military initiative of her foreign interventions against the Revolutions of 1848.|$|E
5|$|United States Navy and Air Force troops {{stationed}} at Lajes functioned as disaster relief workers, sheltering {{as many as}} 150 families. Portuguese Air Force members brought supplies to earthquake victims, while a João Coutinho class corvette navy ship transported medical officials to the island. The Portuguese President, António Ramalho Eanes, flew in on a plane accompanied by medical personnel and supplies (such as bedding). Local officials including policemen and volunteer <b>firemen</b> cleared roads for relief supplies and transports. Responding to the situation, these officials were also involved in looking for survivors in the rubble. Soon after, tents were erected to replace the destroyed or unsafe homes for approximately 200 families of the islands. Portable homes were constructed by the People to People International project fund, resulting in 100 shelters.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, in {{reaction}} to a plan of the policemen of the Boston Police Department to register with a union, Police Commissioner Edwin U. Curtis announced that such an act would not be tolerated. In August of that year, the American Federation of Labor issued a charter to the Boston Police Union. Curtis declared the union's leaders were guilty of insubordination and would be relieved of duty, but indicated he would cancel their suspension if the union was dissolved by September 4. The mayor of Boston, Andrew Peters, convinced Curtis to delay his action for a few days, but with no results, and Curtis suspended the union leaders on September 8. The following day, about three-quarters of the policemen in Boston went on strike. Coolidge, tacitly but fully in support of Curtis' position, closely monitored the situation but initially deferred to the local authorities. He anticipated that only a resulting measure of lawlessness could sufficiently prompt the public to understand and appreciate the controlling principle – that a policeman does not strike. That night and the next, there was sporadic violence and rioting in the unruly city. Peters, concerned about sympathy strikes by the <b>firemen</b> and others, called up some units of the Massachusetts National Guard stationed in the Boston area pursuant to an old and obscure legal authority, and relieved Curtis of duty.|$|E
