40|$|Given the {{ubiquity of}} <b>depletion</b> <b>effects</b> in {{biological}} and other soft matter systems, it is desirable to have coarse-grained Molecular Dynamics simulation approaches appropriate {{for the study of}} complex systems. This paper examines the use of two common truncated Lennard-Jones (WCA) potentials to describe a pair of colloidal particles in a thermal bath of depletants. The shifted-WCA model is the steeper of the two repulsive potentials considered, while the combinatorial-WCA model is the softer. It is found that the depletion-induced well depth for the combinatorial-WCA model is significantly deeper than the shifted-WCA model because the resulting overlap of the colloids yields extra accessible volume for depletants. For both shifted- and combinatorial-WCA simulations, the second virial coefficients and pair potentials between colloids are demonstrated to be well approximated by the Morphometric Thermodynamics (MT) model. This agreement suggests that the presence of depletants can be accurately modelled in MD simulations by implicitly including them through simple, analytical MT forms for depletion-induced interactions. Although both WCA potentials are found to be effective generic coarse-grained simulation approaches for studying <b>depletion</b> <b>effects</b> in complicated soft matter systems, combinatorial-WCA is the more efficient approach as <b>depletion</b> <b>effects</b> are enhanced at lower depletant densities. The findings indicate that for soft matter systems that are better modelled by potentials with some compressibility, predictions from hard-sphere systems could greatly underestimate the magnitude of <b>depletion</b> <b>effects</b> at a given depletant density. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} Monte Carlo model for genome folding at the 30 -nm scale with focus on linker-histone and {{nucleosome}} <b>depletion</b> <b>effects.</b> We find that parameter distributions from experimental {{data do not}} lead to one specific chromatin fiber structure, but instead to a distribution of structures in the chromatin phase diagram. Depletion of linker histones and nucleosomes affects, massively, the flexibility and the extension of chromatin fibers. Increasing the amount of nucleosome skips (i. e., nucleosome depletion) can lead either to a collapse or to a swelling of chromatin fibers. These opposing effects are discussed and we show that <b>depletion</b> <b>effects</b> may even contribute to chromatin compaction. Furthermore, we find that predictions from experimental data for the average nucleosome skip rate lie exactly in the regime of maximum chromatin compaction. Finally, we determine the pair distribution function of chromatin. This function reflects {{the structure of the}} fiber, and its Fourier-transform can be measured experimentally.

50|$|Although {{self-control}} {{has traditionally}} been {{thought of as a}} limited resource that can be depleted, some researchers disagree with this model. While multiple studies provided support for the ego <b>depletion</b> <b>effect,</b> there is currently no direct measure of ego depletion, and studies mainly observe it by measuring how long people persist at a second task after performing a self-control task (the depleting task). The theory of ego depletion relies on the inner workings of an individual's volition, which can only be indirectly tested; therefore, only inferences can be made. Another challenge facing research on ego depletion is the influence of the overall mental conditions of individuals being studied. There is speculation that results may be disrupted in individuals who report experiencing depression and already possess high levels of ego depletion prior to the study.|$|E
40|$|Few {{models of}} {{self-control}} have generated as much scientific interest {{as has the}} limited strength model. One of the entailments of this model, the <b>depletion</b> <b>effect,</b> is the expectation that acts of self-control will be less effective when they follow prior acts of self-control. Results from a previous meta-analysis concluded that the <b>depletion</b> <b>effect</b> is robust and medium in magnitude (d = 0. 62).

40|$|Most {{experimental}} studies of the <b>effects</b> of <b>depletion</b> forces in a colloidal suspensions have so far been performed on systems where the depletion agent {{can be regarded as}} ideal. Here, we review our recent results on systems where depletants present self-interactions. In the first case we focus on a system where strong electrostatic coupling is present in the suspension. At fixed colloid volume fraction, colloidal aggregation takes place when the surfactant concentration reaches a critical value which raises for increasing ionic strength. Screening repulsive electrostatic interactions inhibits the depletion mechanism and weakens the effective colloid-colloid attraction. In the second case, investigating the <b>depletion</b> <b>effects</b> brought in by surfactants that show a liquid-liquid phase separation with water, we shall conversely deal with a situation where long-range spatial correlations are of primary importance in setting the phase behavior of the colloidal fluid.

40|$|Self-control {{strength}} {{is a central}} construct to theories of willpower, optimal functioning, freedom from addiction, and abilities to override problematic social motives and behaviors (e. g., aggression). Understanding the processing basis of self-control strength, and more particularly its depletion, is thus of paramount importance to both basic and applied literatures. Self-control strength, the present review suggests, can be profitably viewed in cognitive control terms, particularly so in relation to operations of a brain-based cognitive control circuit involving the anterior cingulate cortex (linked to monitoring potential or actual unwanted outcomes) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (linked to controlling potential or actual unwanted outcomes).

40|$|This {{research}} delineates and empirically tests how regulatory depletion {{may affect}} high-stress employees' service performance on {{different types of}} job tasks. Using a laboratory experiment and a survey study, the authors examine (1) whether work stress causes a <b>depletion</b> <b>effect,</b> such that high work stress undermines service employees' performance on tasks requiring self-regulation (e. g., customer complaint handling performance) versus tasks requiring limited self-regulation (e. g., customer-directed extra-role performance); (2) whether the <b>depletion</b> <b>effect</b> can be overcome by supervisory support or employees' engagement in perspective taking; and (3) how these moderating effects might be mediated by employees' feelings of fatigue and intrinsic job motivation. The results confirm regulatory depletion: High-stress employees feel more fatigue and perform more poorly than low-stress employees in tasks requiring self-regulation. However, the <b>depletion</b> <b>effect</b> from work stress is largely attenuated on employees' performance on tasks requiring less or limited self-regulation.

40|$|Mitogen-activated protein kinases {{are crucial}} {{regulators}} of various cell fate decisions including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Depending on the cellular context, the Raf-Mek-Erk mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade responds to extracellular stimuli in an all-or-none manner, most {{likely due to}} bistable behavior. Here, we describe a previously unrecognized positive-feedback mechanism that emerges from experimentally observed sequestration effects in the core Raf-Mek-Erk cascade. Unphosphorylated/monophosphorylated Erk sequesters Mek into Raf-inaccessible complexes upon weak stimulation, and thereby inhibits cascade activation. Mek, once phosphorylated by Raf, triggers Erk phosphorylation, which in turn induces dissociation of Raf-inaccessible Mek-Erk heterodimers, and thus further amplifies Mek phosphorylation. We show that this positive circuit can bring about bistability for parameter values measured experimentally in living cells. Previous studies revealed that bistability can also arise from enzyme <b>depletion</b> <b>effects</b> in the Erk double (de) phosphorylation cycle. We demonstrate that the feedback mechanism proposed in this article synergizes with such enzyme <b>depletion</b> <b>effects</b> {{to bring about a}} much larger bistable range than either mechanism alone.
