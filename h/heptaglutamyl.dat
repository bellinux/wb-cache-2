40|$|Background: Before dietary folate is absorbed, {{polyglutamate}} folates are deconjugated to monoglutamates by folylpoly-gamma-glutamyl carboxypeptidase in {{the small}} intestine. The 1561 T allele of the glutamate carboxypeptidase II gene (GCPII), which codes for folylpoly-gamma-glutamyl carboxypeptidase, may impair intestinal absorption of dietary folates. Objective: Our aim was to study the bioavailability of polyglutamyl folic acid relative to that of monoglutamyl folic acid across GCPII 1561 genotypes. Design: In a randomized study, 180 healthy adults aged 50 - 75 y received 323 nmol monoglutamyl folic acid/d (n = 59), 262 nmol <b>heptaglutamyl</b> folic acid/d (n = 61), or placebo (n = 60) for 12 wk. Genotypes were assessed after the intervention. The bioavailability of <b>heptaglutamyl</b> folic acid relative to that of monoglutamyl folic acid was calculated by using the changes in serum folate concentration in the treatment groups, after correction {{for changes in the}} placebo group and for the administered dose. Results: No subjects with the TT genotype were encountered. At baseline, serum and erythrocyte folate concentrations were higher (P < 0. 05) in subjects with the CT genotype [16. 3 nmol/L (geometric (x) over bar; 95 % CI: 13. 7, 19. 3 nmol/L) and 863 nmol/L (735, 1012 nmol/L), respectively; n = 19] than in subjects with the CC genotype [13. 7 (13. 1, 14. 3) and 685 (652, 721) nmol/L, respectively; n = 161]. Baseline homocysteine concentrations were not significantly different between genotypes. The bioavailability of <b>heptaglutamyl</b> folic acid relative to that of monoglutamyl folic acid was not significantly different between subjects with the CC (64 %; 52 %, 76 %) and CT genotypes (70 %; 49 %, 91 %). Conclusions: The 1561 T allele of the GCPII gene does not impair the bioavailability of polyglutamyl folic acid. However, the allele is associated with higher folate status. This association may be explained by yet unidentified factors controlling the expression of the GCPII gene...|$|E

In the Netherlands, the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for folate intake is 300 µg/d. It is not known to what extent ingested folate in the diet is bioavailable, i. e. is absorbed and used or stored in the body. In food, folate is often conjugated to a polyglutamate chain, which has to be removed enzymatically by folylpoly glutamyl carboxypeptidase (FGCP), encoded by the GCPII gene, before absorption can take place. Limitation or inhibition of this process may limit the bioavailability of polyglutamate folate. The aim of the present research was to quantify the effect of the polyglutamate chain on folate bioavailability. This included the modulating effect of the 1561 C>T polymorphism in the GCPII gene. Furthermore, we aimed to establish the minimal   amount of folate that lowers plasma homocysteine concentrations adequately. The average intake of dietary folate in a representative Dutch population sample of 2, 435 men and women aged 20 - 65 y was 210 µg/d. About two thirds of dietary folate intake was in the polyglutamate form. In a 12 -w randomized trial, 180 subjects aged 50 - 75 y consumed daily either a low dose of <b>heptaglutamyl</b> folic acid or monoglutamyl folic acid, or a placebo capsule. The biovailability of <b>heptaglutamyl</b> folic acid relative to that of monoglutamyl folic acid was found to be 66 %. This implies that the bioavailability of folate from the diet is maximally 77 % due to the presence of two thirds of folate as polyglutamate. No differences in bioavailability were found between GCPII 1561 C>T genotypes. In order to reduce the sample size and duration of future studies on folate bioavailability, a new dual isotopic labelling method was developed. This method comprises that low quantities of two differentially isotope labelled folate compounds are simultaneously administered to volunteers during several days. The ratio of isotopically labelled folate in plasma then reflects the bioavailability of one compound relative to the other. This method provides a sensitive, accurate and efficient method for measuring folate bioavailability. In a 12 -w randomized trial comprising 316 subjects aged 50 - 75 y, we established that the amount of folic acid required to reduce plasma homocysteine concentrations adequately is at least 400 µg/d. In conclusion, folate bioavailability from the diet is reduced by approximately 23 % due to the presence of folate in the polyglutamate form. The average intake of folate in the Netherlands is currently lower than the RDA. Moreover, a substantial increase of folate intake is required to reduce plasma homocysteine concentrations adequately, provided that such lowering of plasma homocysteine concentrations is desirable. </span...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{bioavailability}} {{of dietary}} folate {{has been estimated}} to be approximate to 50 % of that of synthetic folic acid. Folate in the diet is linked to a polyglutamate chain that may restrict folate absorption. Objective: Our goal was to quantify the bioavailability and bioefficacy of low doses of polyglutamyl folic acid relative to that of monoglutamyl folic acid. Design: In total, 180 men and women aged 50 - 75 y ingested capsules containing 323 nmol <b>heptaglutamyl</b> folic acid/d or 262 nmol monoglutamyl folic acid/d or placebo in a randomized parallel trial. Serum and erythrocyte folate and plasma homocysteine concentrations were measured after an overnight fast at baseline and after 12 wk of intervention. Results: Mean serum and erythrocyte folate concentrations increased less in the polyglutamyl folic acid group [6. 1 (95 % CI: 5. 3, 7. 0) and 155 (122, 188) nmol/L, respectively] than in the monoglutamyl folic acid group [11. 8 (10. 3, 13. 3) and 282 (246, 318) nmol/L, respectively]. Differences remained statistically significant (P < 0. 05) after correction for {{the difference in the}} amount of folic acid administered. The decrease in plasma homocysteine concentrations did not differ significantly between treatment groups [polyglutamyl: - 12. 1 % (- 14. 8 %, - 9. 3 %); monoglutamyl: - 14. 1 % (- 16. 3 %, - 11. 9 %) ]. The relative bioavailability of polyglutamyl folic acid was 64 % (52 %, 75 %) on the basis of serum folate and was 68 % (51 %, 84 %) on the basis of erythrocyte folate concentrations. Bioefficacy, determined by changes in plasma homocysteine concentrations, was 106 % (77 %, 134 %). Conclusion: The polyglutamate chain of folates in the diet reduces their bioavailability...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which ethanol impairs folate metabolism remains uncertain. In the present study, we used our new technique (affinity/HPLC) for folate analysis to study the effect of chronic alcohol ingestion on the content and distribution of folates in livers. Twelve male Sprague-Dawley rats (180 g) {{were divided into two}} groups, and fed for 4 weeks with Lieber-DeCarli semi-liquid isocaloric diets, with and without 5 % ethanol. Livers were extracted in boiling, pH 9. 3 borate buffers containing ascorbate/dithioerythritol. Folates in the supernatant fractions were purified by affinity chromatography and analyzed using ion pair high performance liquid chromatography. The data obtained showed that hepatic folate distribution in alcohol-treated rats differed from that of control animals in two ways. Livers from the ethanol-fed rats, when compared with those from control rats, exhibited increases in the percent concentrations of methylated tetrahydrofolates (21. 46 ± 2. 21 vs 14. 8 ± 1. 23), decreases in the percent concentrations of formylated tetrahydrofolates (25. 62 ± 4. 02 vs 46. 18 ± 2. 65) and higher concentrations of unsubstituted tetrahydrofolates (52. 91 ± 3. 84 vs 38. 88 ± 2. 50). In addition, alcohol ingestion was associated with longer glutamate chains of the folate molecules, characterized by lower relative concentrations of pentaglutamyl folates (29 vs 48 %), and higher relative concentrations of hexa- and <b>heptaglutamyl</b> folates (55 vs 46 % and 15 vs 6 %) when compared with controls. The data are discussed in relation to possibility that alcohol exerts its effect through: (1) inhibition of B 12 -dependent methyl transfer from methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine; (2) diversion of formylated tetrahydrofolates toward serine synthesis; and (3) interaction of acetaldehyde with tetrahydrofolates, thereby interfering with folate coenzyme metabolism...|$|E
