50|$|Behavioral studies {{prepared}} for the Federal Highway Administration {{and the city of}} San Francisco have shown that streets with shared lane arrows increase separation between motor vehicles and cyclists, encourage cyclists to ride outside of the <b>door</b> <b>zone,</b> and may reduce wrong way cycling and sidewalk cycling, which are associated with increased crash risk.|$|R
50|$|Dooring is {{a traffic}} {{collision}} {{in which a}} cyclist is struck by a car door. The width of the <b>door</b> <b>zone</b> in which this can happen varies, depending upon the model of car one is passing. The zone can be almost zero for a vehicle with gull-wing doors or much larger for a truck.|$|R
50|$|Being doored (colliding {{with the}} door of a car {{unexpectedly}} opened) is a prominent hazard. Many Class II/Class III bike lanes run in the <b>door</b> <b>zone.</b> While the law requires caution in opening car doors into traffic lanes, dooring remains common, and doored cyclists face injury and sometimes death. Cyclists must exercise caution, riding a door's length away from parked cars whenever practicable.|$|R
50|$|It is {{difficult}} to find statistics on the incidence of <b>door</b> <b>zone</b> fatalities, serious injuries, and collisions as the type of accident is often not recorded consistently from city to city. However, an analysis of Chicago bike crashes found that there were 344 reported dooring crashes reported in 2011, for a rate of 0.94 doorings per day. Doorings made up 19.7% of all reported bike crashes. The number of additional doorings that occurred without being reported is unknown.|$|R
50|$|In early 2017 the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (UK) {{endorsed}} the Dutch Reach as the recommended road safety practice to avoid dooring collisions.In May 2017 the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' (USA) introduced the Dutch Reach far hand method into its 2017 Revised Driver's Manual, Chapter 4, Rules of the Road, as best practice for safe exiting of vehicles.

5000|$|Relative {{to other}} {{collisions}} such as getting rear ended, getting doored is less risky: [...] "80.04% of those cyclists who were doored were injured, while 94.40% {{of those in}} non-dooring crashes were injured." [...] Also, {{it should be noted}} that getting doored itself usually is not fatal; rather, most serious door-zone-related injuries are sustained by getting hit by a motor vehicle while swerving to avoid the door. Thus, most deaths and serious injuries occur in the travel lane and not in the <b>door</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we {{proposed}} a slot allocation scheme for multicell OFDMA mobile WiMAX system using <b>zone</b> <b>switching</b> diversity method. Based on our scheme we {{proposed a}}n architecture in which resources are allocated in a hierarchical way. By using fractional frequency reuse in our scheme, QoS requirements for the different SFs in {{the inner and outer}} ring cell are guaranteed. Our scheme does not only coordinate the inner-cell interference but also utilizes opportunistic scheduling to increase the overall throughput of the system while guaranteeing QoS needs in terms of delay for ertPS SFs and packet loss rate for rtPS SFs. In our future work we will include MIMO technology in our scheme of resource allocation.|$|R

The focus of the article is on fractional frequency reuse for guaranteeing quality of service for different service flows. The proposed resource allocation algorithm attempts to capture three types of diversity, namely, mutual interference diversity, traffic diversity, and selective fading channel diversity providing a trade-off between maximizing overall throughput of the system while guaranteeing the {{quality of service requirements}} for a mixture of real-time and nonreal-time service flows under different diversity configurations.|$|R
50|$|Filtering forward, in stopped or {{extremely}} slow traffic, requires {{very slow}} speed and awareness {{that in a}} <b>door</b> <b>zone,</b> vehicle <b>doors</b> may unexpectedly open. Also, unexpected vehicle movements such as lane changes may occur with little warning. Buses and tractor-trailers require extreme care, as the cyclist may be nearly invisible to the drivers who may not expect someone to be filtering forward. To avoid a hook collision with a turning vehicle at an intersection after filtering forward to the intersection, cyclists are taught to either take a position {{directly in front of}} the stopped lead vehicle, or stay behind the lead vehicle. Cyclists should not stop directly at the passenger side of the lead vehicle, that being a blind spot.|$|R

Electromechanical behaviors ahead of an internal electrode tip are numerically simulated in multilayer ferroelectric actuators. Around the electrode edge, the nonuniform electric field generates a concentration of stress due to the incompatible strain as well as spontaneous strain. The preferred domain switching enhances the concentration of residual stress and may cause the actuators to crack. An electrically permeable crack emanating from an internal electrode is analyzed. A large scale domain <b>switching</b> <b>zone</b> {{is found in the}} vicinity of crack tips.

Although exceeding 5 m in the past, lake depth has declined progressively from 3. 8 m in 1980 to 6000 μS cm− 1 in 1991. Increased phosphate concentrations from the late 1970 's (8 – 45 μg L− 1) to the late 1990 's (100 – 1000 μg L− 1) document that the previously eutrophic system with a limited littoral <b>zone</b> <b>switched</b> to hypertrophy dominated by massive cyanobacteria blooms. Oxygen saturation of the water column increased progressively from about 80 % in 1983 to full saturation about 1993, after which it decreased progressively to only 20 % saturation in 1997.

40|$|Two-dimensional phase field {{simulations}} of polarization switching-induced toughening of an electrically permeable crack {{parallel to the}} original polarization direction in a ferroelectric mono-domain were conducted based on the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation. The mono-domain represented a small vicinity region of the crick tip and the crack was loaded by nominal applied mechanical and/or electrical tip fields. The simulation results show that a wing-shaped <b>switched</b> <b>zone</b> is formed forwards from the crack tip under applied loading, which {{is different from the}} backward wing-shaped <b>switched</b> <b>zone</b> for a permeable crack perpendicular to the original polarization direction. The mechanical load to induce a same size of <b>switched</b> <b>zone</b> for a crack parallel to the original polarization is much lower than that for a crack perpendicular to the original polarization direction. Consequently, the polarization switching-induced toughening for a crack parallel to the original polarization, which was characterized by the local J-integral, behaves differently from that of a permeable crack perpendicular to the original polarization direction.

40|$|International audienceThis article {{addresses}} downlink {{resource allocation}} in multi-cell OFDMA mobile WiMAX systems using <b>zone</b> <b>switching</b> diversity method. We propose to use fractional frequency reuse for guaranteeing {{the quality of}} service for different service flows (SFs) in the system. Our approach includes an architecture which coordinates the allocation of resources in terms of slots (the basic allocation unit in time and frequency domain in an OFDMA frame) between the radio resource controller and the radio resource agent which resides in the Base Station. The scheme for slot allocation balances between maximizing the overall throughput of the system while guaranteeing the QoS requirements for a mixture of real-time and non real-time SFs. We used simulations to compare four resource allocation schemes that represent various degrees of multi-cell coordination and taking advantage of multiuser diversity. We find a feasible hierarchical coordination combined with intra-cell multiuser diversity provides large throughput gains compared with non coordinated scheme...|$|R

30|$|We {{propose a}} {{frequency}} planning based on <b>zone</b> <b>switching</b> diversity scheme for multicell OFDMA mobile WiMAX networks. In our approach, {{we focus on}} the use of Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) for guaranteeing the quality of service for the different service flows in the system. We investigate an architecture that coordinates the allocation of resources in terms of slots (the basic allocation unit in time and frequency domain in an OFDMA frame) between the Radio Resource Controller (RRC) and the Radio Resource Agent (RRA) which resides in the Base Station (BS). The proposed algorithm attempts to capture three types of diversity, namely, mutual interference diversity, traffic diversity, and selective fading channel diversity. As a consequence, the proposed algorithm for slot allocation makes a trade-off between maximizing overall throughput of the system while guaranteeing the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for a mixture of real-time and non-real-time service flows under different diversity configurations. Our algorithm is evaluated under various cell configurations and traffic models. The results reveal important insights on the trade-off between cell interference suppression and QoS assurance.|$|R

5000|$|In {{comparison}} to Europe, Canadian cities {{are not as}} bike friendly. Canadian cars are larger with more blind spots, cities have higher speed limits, highways often travel {{in or near the}} core of the city and there is more on-street parking which can present more <b>door</b> <b>zone</b> hazards for cyclists. Consequently, some inexperienced cyclist will use a [...] "pedestrian" [...] style of riding where no cycling facilities exist in order to feel safer cycling in the city such as by riding on the sidewalk, rather than on the roadway. Although pedestrian cycling is technically illegal - as bicycles are deemed to be vehicles under the laws of all provinces - it is a common method in small town and suburban Canada (where pedestrians on sidewalks are often rare). Canadian cycling advocates typically favour cycling facilities like bike paths and bike lanes that provide a buffer between motor vehicles and cyclists. Protected bike lanes or cycle tracks have been adopted in strategic corridors in Montreal, Vancouver, Toronto, Calgary, Edmonton, Saskatoon and Ottawa with plans to add protected bike lanes in Victoria, Winnipeg and other cities across the country wanting to improve rates of active transportation.|$|R
