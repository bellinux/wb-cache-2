5|$|Philosopher G. H. R. Parkinson notes {{a common}} {{objection}} to Kant's argument: that {{what ought to}} be done does not necessarily <b>entail</b> that it is possible. He also argues that alternative conceptions of morality exist which do not rely on the assumptions that Kant makes – he cites utilitarianism as an example which does not require the summum bonum. Nicholas Everitt argues that much moral guidance is unattainable, such as the Biblical command to be Christ-like. He proposes that Kant's first two premises only <b>entail</b> that we must try to achieve the perfect good, not that it is actually attainable.|$|E
5|$|Wellington's forces {{positioning}} {{presented a}} formidable challenge to any attacking force. Any attempt to turn Wellington's right would <b>entail</b> taking the entrenched Hougoumont position. Any attack {{on his right}} centre would mean the attackers would have to march between enfilading fire from Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte. On the left, any attack would also be enfiladed by fire from La Haye Sainte and its adjoining sandpit, and any attempt at turning the left flank would <b>entail</b> fighting through the lanes and hedgerows surrounding Papelotte and the other garrisoned buildings on that flank, and some very wet ground in the Smohain defile.|$|E
5|$|Alphonse was {{a brother}} of Robert de Vere, 6th Earl of Oxford. When the 6th Earl's son died without issue in 1329, he {{obtained}} licence from the king to <b>entail</b> his estates on his nephew, John. It {{was in this}} way that John de Vere, when his uncle died 17 April 1331, became Earl of Oxford. He had made homage and received livery by 17 May.|$|E

In February 2009, the city noted that plans had been designed to renovate both the interior and exterior of the mall.|$|E
5|$|A {{theory for}} the {{evolution}} of aposematism posits that it arises by reciprocal selection between predators and prey, where distinctive features in prey, which could be visual or chemical, are selected by non-discriminating predators, and where, concurrently, avoidance of distinctive prey is selected by predators. Concurrent reciprocal selection (CRS) may <b>entail</b> learning by predators or it may give rise to unlearned avoidances by them. Aposematism arising by CRS operates without special conditions of the gregariousness or the relatedness of prey, and it is not contingent upon predator sampling of prey to learn that aposematic cues are associated with unpalatability or other unprofitable features.|$|E
5|$|After all, {{young people}} are always searching for the beauty in love. They want their love to be beautiful. If they give in to weakness, {{following}} the models of behavior that can rightly be considered a 'scandal in the contemporary world' (and these are, unfortunately, widely diffused models), {{in the depths of}} their hearts they still desire a beautiful and pure love. This is as true of boys as it is of girls. Ultimately, they know that only God can give them this love. As a result, they are willing to follow Christ, without caring about the sacrifices this may <b>entail.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Textual {{entailment}} (TE) {{in natural}} language processing is a directional relation between text fragments. The relation holds whenever the truth of one text fragment follows from another text. In the TE framework, the <b>entailing</b> and <b>entailed</b> texts are termed text (t) and hypothesis (h), respectively. Textual entailment {{is not the same}} as pure logical entailment- it has a more relaxed definition: [...] "t <b>entails</b> h" [...] (t ⇒ h) if, typically, a human reading t would infer that h is most likely true. The relation is directional because even if [...] "t <b>entails</b> h", the reverse [...] "h <b>entails</b> t" [...] is much less certain.|$|R
50|$|In {{linguistic}} semantics, {{a downward}} <b>entailing</b> (DE) propositional operator {{is one that}} denotes a monotone decreasing function. A downward <b>entailing</b> operator reverses the relation of semantic strength among expressions. An expression like “run fast” is semantically stronger than the expression “run” since “John ran fast” <b>entails</b> “John ran”, but not conversely.|$|R
5|$|In 1960, Dull began {{a search}} for a new {{official}} symbol to represent the Institute. He specifically wanted a classic pre-war Ford. Dull's search would <b>entail</b> newspaper ads, radio commercials, and other means to locate this vehicle. The search took him throughout the state and country, but no suitable vehicle was found until the autumn of 1960. Dean Dull spotted a polished 1930 Ford Model A outside of his apartment located in Towers Dormitory. The owner was Captain Ted J. Johnson, Atlanta's chief Delta Air Lines pilot.|$|E
5|$|Kant's {{conception}} of duty does not <b>entail</b> that people perform their duties grudgingly. Although duty often constrains people and prompts {{them to act}} against their inclinations, it still comes from an agent's volition: they desire to keep the moral law. Thus, when an agent performs an action from duty {{it is because the}} rational incentives matter to them more than their opposing inclinations. Kant wished to move beyond the conception morality as externally imposed duties and present an ethics of autonomy, when rational agents freely recognise the claims reason makes upon them.|$|E
5|$|Marvin {{spent five}} months {{scouting}} prisons across the United States and Canada, {{looking for a}} site that had a timeless aesthetic, and was completely abandoned, hoping to avoid the complexity of filming the required footage, for hours each day, in an active prison with the security difficulties that would <b>entail.</b> Marvin eventually chose the Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield, Ohio {{to serve as the}} fictional Shawshank State Penitentiary in Maine, citing its Gothic-style stone and brick buildings. After nearly a century of use, the facility had been closed three years earlier on New Year's Eve, 1990, due to inhumane living conditions.|$|E

50|$|Within work-to-family {{conflict}} and family-to-work conflict, three subtypes of conflict have been identified: time-based, strain-based, and behavior-based. Time-based conflict <b>entails</b> competing time requirements across {{work and family}} roles, strain-based conflict <b>entails</b> pressures in one role impairing performance in the second role, and behavior-based conflict <b>entails</b> an incompatibility of behaviors necessary for the two roles.|$|R
5000|$|In natural {{language}} residuated lattices formalize {{the logic of}} [...] "and" [...] when used with its noncommutative meaning of [...] "and then." [...] Setting x = bet, y = win, z = rich, we can read x•y &le; z as [...] "bet and then win <b>entails</b> rich." [...] By the axioms this is equivalent to y &le; x&rarr;z meaning [...] "win <b>entails</b> had bet then rich", and also to x &le; z&larr;y meaning [...] "bet <b>entails</b> if-ever win then rich." [...] Humans readily detect such non-sequiturs as [...] "bet <b>entails</b> had win then rich" [...] and [...] "win <b>entails</b> if-ever bet then rich" [...] as both being equivalent to the wishful thinking [...] "win and then bet <b>entails</b> rich." [...] Humans do not so readily detect that Peirce's law ((P→Q)→P)→P is a tautology, an interesting situation where humans exhibit more proficiency with nonclassical reasoning than classical.|$|R
5|$|Reformed theologians believe sacraments to be instituted in {{the context}} of {{covenants}} between God and people. They believe that when God makes covenants, he provides physical signs associated with the covenant. Old Testament covenant signs include the rainbow which appeared following a covenant made with Noah. Circumcision is believed to be a sign of God's covenant with Abraham and his descendants. Such signs <b>entail</b> blessings and sanctions on those with whom God covenants. In the New Testament period there are two such signs or sacraments: baptism and the Lord's Supper.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare Quiney died at {{six months}} of age. Richard and Thomas Quiney were buried within nine days of each other, 21 and 19 years old respectively. The deaths of all of Judith's {{children}} resulted in new legal consequences. The <b>entail</b> on her father's inheritance led Susanna, along with her daughter and son-in-law, to make a settlement using a rather elaborate legal device for the inheritance of her own branch of the family. Legal wrangling continued for another thirteen years, until 1652.|$|E

The plan sparked controversy amid doubts raised with respect to environmental protection and biodiversity management, technical and financial feasibility, and procedural problems related to the project. A particular concern expressed was that the underground reservoir might trigger earthquakes.|$|E

In the other, tiles must be assembled such that the bumps on their edges fit together.|$|E
5|$|The medieval {{doctrine}} of divine simplicity also poses problems for religious language. This suggests that God has no accidental properties– these are properties that a being can have {{which do not}} contribute to its essence. If God has no accidental properties, he cannot be as he is traditionally conceived, because properties such as goodness are accidental. If divine simplicity is accepted, then to describe God as good would <b>entail</b> that goodness and God have the same definition. Such limits can also be problematic to religious believers; for example, the Bible regularly ascribes different emotions to God, ascriptions which would be implausible according to the {{doctrine of}} divine simplicity.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{call for}} {{automated}} transponders after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks; no changes were made, as aviation experts preferred flexible control, in case of malfunctions or electrical emergencies. In the wake of Flight 370, the air transport industry was still resistant to the installation of automated transponders, which would likely <b>entail</b> significant costs. Pilots also criticised changes of this kind, insisting {{on the need to}} cut power to equipment {{in the event of a}} fire.

5|$|These {{plans were}} {{extremely}} controversial. All three envisaged {{reducing the number}} of stalls from 205 to 140–160 to increase space, and all three involved splitting the market into isolated clusters of stalls, significantly altering its character and appearance. The Eastern Daily Press organised a campaign against the perceived unattractiveness of the designs, the proposed {{reduction in the number of}} stalls which would mean stallholders losing their jobs and the remaining stallholders facing rent increases to cover the difference, and the change to the character of central Norwich that such a radical redesign of the market would <b>entail.</b> A petition of over 12,000 signatories rejecting all three proposed designs was gathered.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, Switzerland avoids alliances {{that might}} <b>entail</b> military, political, or direct {{economic}} action {{and has been}} neutral {{since the end of}} its expansion in 1515.

Only in 2002 did Switzerland become a full member of the United Nations {{and it was the first}} state to join it by referendum. Switzerland maintains diplomatic relations with almost all countries and historically has served as an intermediary between other states. Switzerland is not a member of the European Union; the Swiss people have consistently rejected membership since the early 1990s. However, Switzerland does participate in the Schengen Area.|$|E
5|$|When {{speaking}} of {{language as a}} general concept, definitions can be used which stress {{different aspects of the}} phenomenon. These definitions also <b>entail</b> different approaches and understandings of language, and they also inform different and often incompatible schools of linguistic theory. Debates about the nature and origin of language go back to the ancient world. Greek philosophers such as Gorgias and Plato debated the relation between words, concepts and reality. Gorgias argued that language could represent neither the objective experience nor human experience, and that communication and truth were therefore impossible. Plato maintained that communication is possible because language represents ideas and concepts that exist independently of, and prior to, language.|$|E
