We studied at diagnosis 52 cases of warm AIHA with positive direct antiglobulin test. Immunohaematological testing and determination of immunoglobulin class, complement, and immunoglobulin G (IgG) were performed using gel technology (GCT). Median haemoglobin (Hb) levels significantly differed between cases with IgG 1 only or negative for IgG subclasses (7. 4  g/dl), those with IgG 3 or IgG 1  + IgG 3 (6. 5  g/dl), and those with multiple immunoglobulins (5  g/dl).

The finding of immunoproteins in the synovium of the majority of patients with RS suggests that immunological mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. The aetiology of Reiter's syndrome (RS) is unknown. Its relationship to sexual contact and epidemic dysentery has led investigators to see an infectious aetiology, but efforts to find a causative agent have been largely unsuccessful. Reports by Brewerton et al. ] and Morris et al. 2 that 75 - 96 % of RS patients are HLA B 27 positive have spurred interest in genetic mechanisms which might play a role in its pathogenesis. A predetermined susceptibility for developing RS is likely. Immunological factors have also received consideration in the pathogenesis of RS. Other reports 3 4 support this possibility.

High expression of VEGF-C in tumors correlates with increased lymphatic vessel density, lymphatic vessel invasion, sentinel lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis. Recently, we found that in a chemically induced skin carcinoma model, increased VEGF-C drainage from the tumor enhanced lymphangiogenesis in the sentinel lymph node and facilitated metastatic spread of cancer cells via the lymphatics. Hence, interference with the VEGF-C/VEGF-R 3 axis holds promise to block metastatic spread, as recently shown by use of a neutralizing anti-VEGF-R 3 antibody and a soluble VEGF-R 3 (VEGF-C/D trap). By antibody phage-display, we have developed a human monoclonal antibody fragment (single-chain Fragment variable, scFv) that binds with high specificity and affinity to the fully processed mature form of human VEGF-C. The scFv binds to an epitope on VEGF-C that is important for receptor binding, since binding of the scFv to VEGF-C dose-dependently inhibits the binding of VEGF-C to VEGF-R 2 and VEGF-R 3 as shown by BIAcore and ELISA analyses. Interestingly, the variable heavy domain (V(H)) of the anti-VEGF-C scFv, which contains a mutation typical for camelid heavy chain-only antibodies, is sufficient for binding VEGF-C.

Therefore, the development of selective adsorbents for the removal or decrease of <b>immunoproteins</b> from plasma is of great importance. In this study, chitosan, a natural polysaccharide having structural character-istics similar to glycosamino glycans, which is non-toxic and biocompatible, has been used for protein adsorption studies. Amino acids like phenyl alanine and tryptophan in different ratios are bonded to these polymers to observe immuno-adsorption. Several layers of phenyl alanine or tryptophan have been coated covalently on chitosan beads using N 2 -plasma, carbodiimide or glutaraldehyde treatments. Scanning electron micrographs have revealed the surface morpho-logical changes after such modifications. The surface modified chitosan beads have exhibited high binding affinity for &gamma;-globulin compared to bare beads. It is also observed that the amount of fibrinogen adsorption is reduced on modified substrate. A selective removal of IgG and IgM has also been observed with these modified matrix when tested with human plasma, using immuno diffusion methods.

Roe deer testis and serum samples were collect-ed bimonthly throughout the complete reproductive cycle. Peak levels of testicular Insl 3 mRNA and INSL 3 <b>immunoprotein</b> were detected well before the onset of rut in April and coincided with the highest percentage of INSL 3 -positive cell number/square millimeter of testicular interstitial area. During the winter (De-cember, February), roe deer INSL 3 was exclusively detected in a subpopulation of alpha-actin-negative, spindle-shaped peritu-bular cells. Concordant with the increase in INSL 3 production in April and 1 mo after the reported LH peak, a sharp increase in serum testosterone concentrations was observed. High serum testosterone concentrations coincided with the presence of de-tectable 17 alpha-hydroxylase, mRNA and protein, in Leydig cells. Upregulation of INSL 3 production in spring appeared to reflect LH-dependent differentiation of Leydig cells.

40|$|In {{addition}} to cytokines, CD 4 + T cells {{have been found}} to secrete soluble, T-cell-derived antigen binding molecules (TABMs). These antigen-specific <b>immunoproteins</b> are thought to have immunoregulatory properties in the suppression of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) because they often associate with interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) and transforming growth factor beta. Decreased CMI causes susceptibility to infections caused by organisms which are normally nonpathogenic. In this situation, e. g., Candida albicans saprophytism may develop into invasive candidiasis. The difficult diagnosis of invasive candidiasis is based on the findings obtained from blood cultures and with tissue biopsy specimens, with some additional diagnostic value gained by the detection of Candida albicans mannan antigenemia and antimannan antibodies. In the present study, Candida albicans mannan-specific TABM (CAM-TABM) levels in the sera of patients with invasive candidiasis (n = 11), Candida colonization (n = 11) and noncolonization (n = 10), recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (n = 30), and atopic eczema dermatitis syndrome (n = 59) and healthy controls (n = 30) were analyzed. For 14 participants, the effect of mannan stimulation on TABM production and gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and IL- 4 mRNA expression by peripheral blood lymphocytes was also studied. It was demonstrated that CAM-TABM production was the highest in patients with invasive candidiasis and that CAM-TABM levels could distinguish Candida-colonized patients from noncolonized patients. In addition, the CAM-TABM level was directly related to mRNA expression for IL- 4 but not IFN-γ. These results reinforce the view that TABMs are associated with decreased CMI, immunoregulation, and the T-helper cell 2 -type immune response...|$|R

40|$|Sedimentation FFF is a {{sensitive}} method {{for measuring the}} mass of an adsorbed layer on colloidal particles and {{it is able to}} evaluate surface concentrations of immunoglobulins or antibodies (Igs) adsorbed to polystyrene latex particles [1 - 2]. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is the main immunoglobulin in mucous secretions, including tears, saliva and colostrum. IgA believed {{to play an important role}} in defense mechanisms against infections and because it is resistant to degradation by enzymes, secretory IgA provides protection against microbes proliferating in body secretions, especially those of the digestive and respiratory tracts [3]. Binding of Igs onto a hydrophilic surfaces lies at the center of a multitude of biological, biomedical and biotechnological application. Chromatographic supports, membranes and latex particles are only few examples of substrates on which <b>immunoproteins</b> may be adsorbed. Immobilization of the Igs may be due either by physical adsorption or by covalent binding to functionalized surface groups. Appropriate conditions for binding are as varied as the type of molecules concerned and their chemical binding properties. IgA show a strong tendency to adsorb on polystyrene (PS), under several different chemical-physical conditions. In this work the mass of IgA adsorbed onto PS microsphere standard has been determined from SdFFF fractograms obtained by varying the mobile phase composition. The compatibility of the SdFFF channel with several buffers used as carriers was proven, in particular, density, chemical composition, its pH and its ionic content, have been considered as experimental variables. Their ability to correctly fractionate the PS and the PS-IgA complex has been tested on two monodispersed polystyrene latex microbeads samples. The surface reactivity of the complex PS-IgA has been verified by preparing the ternary complex PS-IgA-antiIgA (specific antigen-antibody reaction) and by monitoring the increase of mass by SdFFF. The negative control was the reaction between the complex PS-IgA and anti IgE, which did not occurred as proven by the registered fractograms...|$|R

Here, we describe the use of immuno-PET imaging with iodine- 124 (124 I) – labeled L 19 SIP to predict doses delivered to tumor lesions and healthy organs by a subsequent radretumab RIT in patients with brain metastases from solid cancer. Bone marrow doses were evaluated both during the diagnostic phase and posttherapy, measuring activities in blood (germanium detector) and whole body (lanthanum bromide detector). Expected doses for radretumab administration (4, 107 MBq/m 2) were calculated from data obtained after administration of an average of 167 MBq 124 I-L 19 SIP to 6 patients. To assess lesion average doses, the positron emission tomography (PET) scanner was calibrated {{for the use of}} 124 I with an International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Body Phantom and recovery coefficients were calculated. The average dose to bone red marrow was 0. 21 Gy/GBq, with high correlation between provisional and actual posttherapy doses. Although the fraction of injected activity in normal organs was similar in different patients, the antibody uptake in the neoplastic lesions varied by as much as a factor of 60. Immuno-PET with 124 I-labeled L 19 SIP offers significant advantages over conventional 131 I imaging, in particular accuracy of dosimetric results. Furthermore, the study indicates that antibody uptake can be highly variable even in different lesions of the same patient and that immuno-PET procedures may guide product development with armed antibodies.

40|$|Introduction Arthritis in Reiter's {{syndrome}} (RS) is a reactive synovitis {{associated with}} a localized infection of the urogenital or gastrointestinal tract with a genetic predisposition. The pathogenetic mechanisms for synovitis in RS are still unknown. Our aim was to examine some of the pathogenetic mechanisms in Reiter's syndrome looking for morphologic changes, <b>immunoprotein</b> deposits and microorganism antigens in synovial biopsies and to determine whether synovial biopsy is useful in diagnosis of RS. Material and methods Thirty patients with urogenital form of RS were examined within a four-year period. Table 1 illustrates laboratory findings in our patients. We performed synovial biopsies looking for histopathological changes, deposits of immunoproteins and microorganism antigens. Analysis of synovial biopsy specimens was performed using light and immunofluorescence microscopy and fluorescein-labelled monoclonal antibodies to Chlamydia trachomatis. Results Histopathological examination of synovial membrane revealed marked proliferation of the synovial lining cells (SLC) with less or more abundant papillary projections, hypertrophic and edematous tissue with marked vascularisation in 28 (93. 3 %) cases. Fibrinoid necrosis foci were seen {{on the surface of}} synovial tissue. Chronic inflammatory cells (CIC) were diffusely distributed. Edema of the vessel walls, swollen endothelial cells, fibrinoid necrosis in vessel walls as well as multilaminated basement membranes were observed. All histopathologic changes are presented in Table 2. Immunofluorescent techniques in 12 out of 30 (40 %) synovial membranes showed immunoglobulin deposits: IgG and IgA deposits were found in vessel walls in 7 cases each and IgM in 10 biopsy specimens. C 3 was present perivascularly or within the vessel wall in 4 (13. 3 %) cases. Sections treated using fluorescein-conjugated antibody revealed Chlamydia in the synovial tissue in 2 patients. Conclusion Biopsy specimens with previously described changes in patients with suspected Reiter's syndrome can be useful to confirm the diagnosis. According to our experience, multiple biopsies of abnormal synovia are recommended in these patients...|$|E

The human monoclonal antibody L 19 - SIP targets the extra domain B of fibronectin, {{a marker of}} angiogenesis expressed {{in a range of}} tumours. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whole body distribution, tumour localisation and the potential of radioimmunotherapy with the L 19 -small <b>immunoprotein</b> (SIP) in colorectal tumours. Two colorectal tumour models with highly different morphologies, the SW 1222 and LS 174 T xenografts, were used in this study. Localisation and retention of the L 19 -SIP antibody at tumour vessels was demonstrated using immunohistochemistry and Cy 3 -labelled L 19 -SIP. Whole body biodistribution studies in both tumour models were carried out with 125 I-labelled L 19 -SIP. Finally, 131 I-labelled antibody was used to investigate the potential of radioimmunotherapy in SW 1222 tumours. Using immunohistochemistry, we confirmed extra domain B expression in the tumour vasculature. Immunofluorescence demonstrated localisation and retention of injected Cy 3 -labelled L 19 -SIP at the abluminal side of tumour vessels. Biodistribution studies using a 125 I-labelled antibody showed selective tumour uptake in both models. Higher recorded values for localisation were found in the SW 1222 tumours than in the LS 174 T (7. 9 vs 6. 6 [*]%ID[*]g− 1), with comparable blood clearance for both models. Based on these results, a radioimmunotherapy study was performed in the SW 1222 xenograft using 131 I-Labelled L 19 -SIP (55. 5 [*]MBq), which showed selective tumour uptake, tumour growth inhibition and improved survival. Radio- and fluorescence-labelled L 19 -SIP showed selective localisation and retention at vessels of two colorectal xenografts. Furthermore, 131 I-L 19 -SIP shows potential as a novel treatment of colorectal tumours, and provides the foundation to investigate combined therapies in the same tumour models...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{optimisation}} of capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection for capillary and microchip electrophoresis and its applications in analytical chemistry. First, the effect of high excitation voltages and operation frequencies on the capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detector cell for conventional capillary electrophoresis is evaluated. The detector electrodes comprised two steel tubes cut from hypodermic needles, through which the capillaries were inserted. It is demonstrated that increasing excitation voltages from 25 V pp, to 250 Vpp improves the detection limits {{by a factor of}} 10. The high actuator voltage approach was also investigated for contactless conductivity detection on a glass-microchip device with ancm long channel. The detector electrodes formed part of the microchip and were placed on the microchip directly above the microchannel. In a separate project the simplification of on-microchip contactless conductivity detection was accomplished. This was achieved by integrating the detector electrodes on to a chip-holder specifically designed for this purpose. Thus the electrodes were a part of the holder, an improvement of the previous arrangement whereby the detector electrodes were situated on the microdevice. Finally the applications and advantages of the optimised high-voltage capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection for inorganic and organic analysis were demonstrated. The separation and detection of 14 metal ions was accomplished in less than six minutes. The compatibility of this detector with non-UV transparent, polymer capillaries has been demonstrated. The detection of native amino acids has been evaluated. Part of the work was dedicated to the on-chip analysis of various classes of organic ions. The two <b>immunoproteins</b> human immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG), were analysed in their unlabelled state on both capillary and lab-on-chip platforms. All species involved in an immunological interaction between IgM and IgG could be detected. A method for the analysis of selected basic pharmaceutical drug substances was developed. Detection limits comparable to those supplied by direct UV detection were obtained. Main component assays of selected pharmaceutical preparations have been demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|An {{efficient}} {{alternative for}} chromatographic column is adsorptive membrane which canovercome the mass-transfer limitations of packed column such as high-pressure packing,intraparticle diffusion, and high {{pressure drop in}} operation. With research experience on thisarea {{for a couple of}} years, the PI aims to develop the technique of novel multi-functionaladsorptive membrane for analytical or sensing application. This project will focus on a seriesof chemical modifications on commercial porous membrane or fiber with OH groups. Thesemodifications are either in serial or in parallel, and each modification will create one specialtype of functional groups on solid matrix for one or more adsorption applications. Three chemical modification procedures are proposed {{in the first year of}} this project. Thefirst step is to react the OH groups on solid matrix with the NCO group of MIA (4 -isocyanato- 4 '(3, 3 -dimethyl- 2, 4 -dioxo-azetidino) diphenyl-methane) such that the azetidine- 2, 4 -dioneterminal of MIA will be exposed on the matrix surface. The azetidine- 2, 4 -dione could quicklyreact with primary aliphatic amines at high efficiency. Thus, anticipated in the second step isthe solid matrix modification with aminosuccinic acid. The exposed groups on solid matrix willbecome di-carboxylic acid, which could adsorb heavy metal ions by chelation, or adsorbphenols and triazines via hydrogen bonding. The solid matrix with immobilized metal ions maybe further adopted as immobilized metal affinity adsorbent. The third modification suggests tocouple -PGA onto the MIA-reacted solid matrix in order to create multi-COOH groups. Theresulted matrix will serve as a weak cation exchanger for adsorbing cationic dyes or proteins. In the second year, this project will concentrate on the immobilization of fluorescent dyeonto the membrane or fiber for adsorption or sensing purpose. The first step is to couplecarbazole- 9 -propionyl chloride onto the solid matrix for producing a fluorescent sensingmaterial. Moreover, the exposed carbazole groups on the matrix could provide for hydrophobicadsorption. Proposed in next two modification steps in parallel is the creation of quaternaryammonium groups (by nitration, reduction, and quateramination) and sulfonic acid groups (bysulfonation) on the carbazole- 9 -propionyl chloride-immobilized matrix. Thus, the sensingmatrix will turn into strong ion exchangers for adsorbing anionic DNA and cationic proteins. Inaddition, primary amine groups will be produced on the solid matrix after nitration andreduction, which could further react with glutaraldehyde. The created CHO terminal may evenfurther couple with <b>immunoproteins</b> to form an immunoaffinity adsorbent. In this year, thechange of fluorescence on the solid matrix will also be detected for sensing application. 吸附性薄膜分離技術之能成為層析管柱替代技術之一，主要因其能解決層析管柱的高壓填充、孔洞內擴散限制、與高操作壓降等問題，提升經濟效益。本實驗室經過多年來於吸附性薄膜的研究經驗累積，希望能發展多功能吸附性薄膜的製備方法，以應用於微量分析或感測用途。因此，本計畫建議以商業具有OH 基的微過濾薄膜或玻璃纖維為基材進行一連串化學改質實驗，這些化學改質可以是並聯式或串聯式，而每一項化學改質所形成的官能基即可提供一或多重吸附用途，達到多功能的應用目標。第一年度本計畫建議進行以下的化學改質實驗：第一步為帶OH 基的薄膜或纖維與合成之化學物質MIA (4 -isocyanato- 4 ’(3, 3 -dimethyl- 2, 4 -dioxo-azetidino) diphenyl-methane) 進行反應，MIA 可提供一端的NCO 官能基與OH 基反應，而顯露出另一端的azetidine- 2, 4 -dione 官能基。第二步為將帶有azetidine- 2, 4 -dione 官能基的薄膜或纖維與aminosuccinic acid 反應，如此薄膜或纖維表面將改質為具螯合作用的雙COOH 官能基，可應用於多類吸附用途，如：螯合吸附重金屬離子；而金屬離子螯合的薄膜或纖維可再進一步做為固定化金屬親和吸附材，以吸附分離生物分子；藉氫鍵作用吸附酚類物質或三氮六環衍生物等。前兩步化學改質屬於串聯式的反應設計，第三步化學改質則與第二步化學改質為相似的應用，屬於並聯式設計。第三步化學改質建議將薄膜或纖維上的azetidine- 2, 4 -dione 官能基與-PGA 的一級胺基反應，使其固定上薄膜或纖維，如此薄膜或纖維表面將具有多重COOH 官能基，可應用於吸附酚類物質或三氮六環衍生物，也可應用為弱陽離子交換吸附材，吸附陽離子染料或蛋白質等。第二年度本計畫建議進行固定螢光染料於薄膜或纖維的化學改質，以做為吸附或感測材之應用。第一步為帶OH 基的薄膜或纖維與carbazole- 9 -propionyl chloride 反應，因其具COCl 官能基，易與OH 基反應，而固定之後基材將顯露出carbazole 官能基，可應用於疏水物質的吸附。第二步化學改質為將固定有carbazole- 9 -propionyl chloride 的薄膜或纖維進行硝化與還原反應，以獲得具一級胺基的薄膜或纖維，可應用於吸附酚類或三氮六環衍生物等。本計畫另建議將具一級胺基的薄膜或纖維進一步在鹼性環境下與溴乙烷反應，使產生四級胺基，可做為強陰離子交換吸附材，應用於DNA 的吸附。第三步化學改質為將帶一級胺基的薄膜或纖維與兩端帶有醛基的glutaraldehyde 反應，反應後薄膜或纖維上將顯露醛基，可應用於蛋白質之化學吸附，且可更進一步應用於免疫吸附用途。第四步化學改質屬於並聯式設計， 建議將第一步化學改質所得固定有carbazole- 9 -propionyl chloride 的薄膜或纖維進行磺化反應，以做為強陽離子交換吸附材，應用於金屬離子或陽離子蛋白質的吸附。因本年度的化學改質一開始即將薄膜或纖維固定上螢光染料，故可藉由基材螢光性質的變化，尋找適當的檢量線，做為後續吸附/脫附實驗的定量之用，而這也正是一種感測用途...|$|R
40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} to identify salivary components of mucosal pellicles in vivo and explore further the mechanism of interaction between salivary molecules and buccal epithelial cells. By using specific antisera and <b>immunoprotein</b> blotting, high-(MG 1) and low-(MG 2) molecular-mass salivary mucins, amylase, salivary cystatins and proline-rich proteins were detected within mucosal pellicle in vivo. In addition, the data indicated that the mucins and proline-rich proteins could be cleaved into lower-molecular-mass products, whereas the proline-rich proteins could also be cross-linked into higher-molecular-mass complexes. The role of buccal epithelial cell transglutaminase in these interactions was further studied by utilizing purified iodinated amylase, neutral cystatin SN and acidic proline-rich proteins 1 and 3 (APRP 1 and 3). After incubation with buccal epithelial cells in vitro 125 I-labelled APRPs appeared to undergo {{a greater degree of}} cross-linking than 125 I-labelled cystatin SN, as determined by SDS/PAGE/autoradiography. Amylase {{did not appear to be}} cross-linked at all. Recovery of 125 I-labelled APRPs and 125 I-labelled cystatin SN with epithelial cell envelopes after repeated extraction suggested that both molecules were cross-linked to envelope proteins, but that 125 I-labelled APRPs were cross-linked to a greater degree than 125 I-labelled cystatin SN. Cross-linking in buccal epithelial cell preparations was inhibited by an excess of methylamine hydrochloride, a transglutaminase substrate. In a further assessment of amylase, cystatin and APRPs as transglutaminase substrates, only APRP 3 and a partially purified preparation of APRPs acted as an amine acceptor for the cross-linking of [14 C]methylamine by purified transglutaminase, as determined by SDS/PAGE/fluorography. This reaction was completely inhibited by excess EDTA. The combined data from this study suggest that during mucosal pellicle formation multiple components of saliva adsorb to buccal epithelial cell surfaces, and that, within this group, selected components are enzymically cross-linked by an epithelial transglutaminase and/or proteolytically cleaved into smaller fragments...|$|E
