500|$|Television Without Pity {{gave the}} episode an [...] "A". Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave a glowing review, stating that [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>this</b> {{is one of}} the most dense and {{interesting}} episodes of Veronica Mars yet, on a number of different levels." [...] He went on to praise the return of Troy, the various subplots, and the episode's ambiguous conclusion. The reviewer summed up by saying, [...] "With all that going on, it could have been easy for this episode to fall apart somewhere... "The Rapes of Graff" [...] really managed to do everything it was trying to do quite well. It may have been missing something special to put it in the absolute top tier of Veronica Mars episodes, but it's still a marvelous episode for pulling all those different strands together. Anais Bordages of BuzzFeed ranked the episode 27th of 64 episodes of Veronica Mars, but nevertheless gave a positive review, calling it [...] "awesome". She elaborated, [...] "The banter is excellent, our main character shoots down every sexist on campus, and Michael Cera has a cameo. Even better: The other part of the episode revolves around Cliff’s sexual misfortunes." [...] On a similar list, TV Line ranked the episode 16th.|$|E
500|$|Other {{reviews from}} the North American {{leg of the}} tour {{included}} Melissa Ruggierie writing for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution online blog. Ruggierie praised Beyoncé's performance, particularly the strong vocals demonstrated in [...] "1+1" [...] and concluded [...] "watching her command a stadium stage for two hours was another reminder of her limitless ambition". However, {{it was noted that}} Beyoncé did not speak to the crowd very often. After Beyoncé's hometown performance in Houston, Brandon Caldwell of the Houston Press introduced his article stating [...] "Hours after the slaying, the wig snatching, the fitted snatching, the life getting, the boy byes and various curses of shock, amazement and confusion, I stood with a perplexed look on my face. How? How does Beyoncé do this? On this level? With this magnitude?". Lorraine Ali of the Los Angeles Times concluded her positive review of the Pasadena stop of the tour with [...] "Soaking wet and sitting onstage alone, she left the audience with the closing number, [...] "Halo". She'd been baptized and reborn into a less-perfect version of Queen Bey, allowing a more powerful Beyoncé to arise from that imperfection". Jim Harrington of the San Jose Mercury News began his article stating [...] "there were so many moving parts – a tremendous swirl of sharply choreographed dance routines, cool special effects, brilliant fireworks and other tactics for delighting tens of thousands", Harrington noted however that too many snippets of songs rather than their full versions were performed, feeling quality over quantity was missed. The first Canadian show of the tour in Edmonton was performed in cold and rainy conditions, with Beyoncé stating [...] "Can you feel your fingers? I can't feel mine" [...] and [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> is the coldest show I've ever done". Despite this, Sandra Sperounes of the Edmonton Journal commented [...] "not even rain or bitter wind could stop our Ms. Flawless, our Survivor, our Queen Bey from dazzling an estimated 40,000 fans at Commonwealth Stadium on a stormy Friday night." [...] Sperounes concluded [...] "the sun was nowhere to be found, but thanks to Bey's brilliant set, the crowd left beaming with giddiness, girl power and generosity".|$|E
2500|$|Legendary Motown {{songwriter}} {{and producer}} Lamont Dozier hailed Going Back; [...] "Recording {{an album of}} Motown covers can be tricky, but I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> album has exceeded my expectations. Phil Collins has truly given us the real thing vocally, instrumentally, and production-wise... It's spectacular, {{making it impossible to}} pick a favorite because they're all masterfully done." ...|$|E
6000|$|The instant Mr. Crossbite {{had ended}} what he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>this</b> gentleman {{walked up to}} my father, with, 'Your servant, Mr. Fairford--it is long since you and I met.' ...|$|R

60|$|They {{turned back}} to the {{homestead}} presently and on reaching it Prescott found that Colston had arrived. The latter gave him an interview in the barn, which was the only place where they could be alone, and listened with a thoughtful air <b>to</b> what he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>This</b> included an account of his meeting with Laxton and the pursuit of Wandle.|$|R
2500|$|This {{sentiment}} {{was shared}} by the governments of Malaysia ("inadequate to calm the anger"), and Jordan ("a step forward", but [...] "not sufficient"), by Turkish State Minister Mehmet Aydın ("you either <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> 'I'm sorry' in a proper way or not say it at all. Are you sorry for saying such a thing or because of its consequences?") and scholar Yusuf al-Qaradawi, who called for a [...] "peaceful international day of rage" [...] on his popular TV show on Al Jazeera: [...] " [...] were no apology. They were an accusation against Muslims that they didn't understand his words." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "This is {{the sixth}} one I have seen here at San Quentin, and I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> was very different. The most notable {{thing was that}} Williams had {{supporters}} {{at the back of}} the room… Mrs. Becnel was among them, I understand. We could see them, and throughout the last part of the execution—or preparing him when he was still conscious, they gave what looked like black power salutes several times to him, one man and two women. And most strikingly at the end of the execution, as those three were heading out, they yelled, 'The State of California just killed an innocent man!' [...] which is the first time I ever heard any outburst in the death chamber there." ...|$|E
2500|$|The final single, [...] "God's Hotel" [...] was co-written with Nick Cave. Kelly {{had read}} Cave's book of lyrics, King Ink (1988), and found [...] "God's Hotel". When {{interviewing}} Cave for {{a newspaper article}} in The Age, Kelly asked about the lyrics, Cave said [...] "It's just a blues ... You can use the words if you want". Kelly only used five of twelve verses and adapted the tune from the chords of [...] "Bittersweet" [...] by Hoodoo Gurus. [...] "Everybody Wants to Touch Me" [...] describes how a pregnant woman becomes the object of curiosity, wonder or revulsion. Although some believe the song relates to a celebrity being the centre of attention (see Paul Kapsis' cover version). In 2000 Kelly's friend Deborah Conway recorded her version for The Women at the Well tribute album. Kelly noted [...] "I don't like all covers of my songs but I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> one's awesome. Absolutely". [...] "Lately" [...] was co-written with Geyer and followed their work on the soundtrack for the ABC-TV mini series The Seven Deadly Sins, Geyer and Kelly sang alongside Vika Bull and Conway for the 13 tracks. The cover art for Wanted Man is a colophon rendering of Australia's legendary outlaw Ned Kelly (no relation) as a guitarist and was painted by David Band.|$|E

2500|$|In October 1974, Benny {{cancelled}} {{a performance}} in Dallas {{after suffering a}} dizzy spell, coupled with numbness in his arms. Despite a battery of tests, Benny's ailment could not be determined. When he complained of stomach pains in early December, a first test showed nothing, but a subsequent one showed he had inoperable pancreatic cancer. Benny went into a coma at home on December 22, 1974. While in a coma, he was visited by close friends including George Burns, Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Johnny Carson and John Rowles. He died on December 26, 1974 at age 80. At the funeral George Burns, Benny's best friend for more than fifty years, attempted to deliver a eulogy but broke down shortly after he began {{and was unable to}} continue. Bob Hope also delivered a eulogy in which he stated, [...] "For a man who was the undisputed master of comedy timing, you would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> is the only time when Jack Benny's timing was all wrong. He left us much too soon." [...] He was interred in a crypt at Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery in Culver City, California. As a tribute to his skinflint stage persona, visitors often leave pennies on his crypt. [...] Benny's will arranged for a single long-stemmed red rose, to be delivered to his widow, Mary Livingstone, every day {{for the rest of her}} life. Livingstone died nine years later on June 30, 1983.|$|E

60|$|I have quoted {{only part}} of the passage of Scripture in which these words occur. If you want a good {{employment}} for All Saints' Day, read the whole passage, the whole chapter; and no less, the 11th chapter, which comes before it: so will you understand better the meaning of All Saints' Day. But sufficient for the day is the good thereof, as well as the evil; and the good which I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> morning is--You are come to the spirits of just men made perfect; for this is All Saints' Day.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes! Ask, if you will, and I {{will answer}} you. I know it {{because this was}} the real point of all his message to you. This was what I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>This</b> is really why I have come. The {{document}}--the document, mind,--he said no more, but {{he told me to}} make this very clear to you--the document is in a worn leather case, sewn inside the breast pocket of the coat Sinclair was wearing when he died." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{does not}} matter what I have done. There are reasons, which made me wish to avoid your {{immediate}} coming. At the present moment it would interfere gravely with his happiness and with mine were he to learn the circumstances of Sir Francis Geraldine's courtship. Of course it is painful to me to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> to you. It is so painful that to avoid it I have absolutely written to you telling you not to come. This I have done not to avoid your coming, which {{would otherwise have been}} a pleasure to me, but to save myself from this great pain. Now you know it all, and know also what it is that I expect from you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There are no sharper eyes {{anywhere}} {{than those}} of Sammy Jay, and I'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> for him, that whenever he discovers any danger he always gives us warning. He has saved {{the lives of a}} good many of us feathered folks in this way. If it wasn't for this habit of stealing our eggs I wouldn't have a word to say against him, but at that, he isn't as bad as Blacky the Crow. They say Blacky does some good by destroying white grubs and some other harmful pests, but he's a regular cannibal, for he is just as fond of young birds as he is of eggs, and the harm he does in this way is more than the good he does in other ways. He's bold, black, and bad, if you ask me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>this,</b> then, lord: {{that most}} humbly I crave thy pardon for my ill words, and ask thee {{to put them}} away from thy mind. Sore heart makes sour speech, and thou knowest well that, howsoever great my faults, at least I have always loved thee and laboured for thee, and methinks that in some fashion thy {{fortunes}} are the debtor to my wisdom. Therefore when my ears heard that thou hadst of a truth put me away, and that another woman comes an honoured wife to rule in Middalhof, my tongue forgot its courtesy, and I spoke words that are of all words the farthest from my mind. For I know well that I grow old, and have put off that beauty with which I was adorned of yore, and that held thee to me. 'Carline' Eric Brighteyes named me, and 'carline' I am--an old hag, no more! Now, forgive me, and, in memory of all that has been between us, let me creep to my place in the ingle and still watch and serve thee and thine till my service is outworn. Out of Ran's net I came to thee, and, if thou drivest me hence, I tell thee that I will lie down and die upon thy threshold, and when thou sinkest into eld surely the memory of it shall grieve thee." ...|$|E

40|$|Calvin's {{doctrine}} {{concerning the}} church.

Next thing, I suppose you'll be yapping about free speech. Free speech!

6000|$|Even {{the women}} concurred in praising and loving her. The Duchess of Queensberry bears {{testimony}} to her amiable qualities, and writes to her: “I tell you so and so, because you love children, {{and to have}} children love you.” The beautiful, jolly Mary Bellenden, represented by contemporaries as “the most perfect creature ever known”, writes very pleasantly to her “dear Howard”, her “dear Swiss”, from the country, whither Mary had retired after her marriage, and when she gave up being a maid of honour. “How do you do, Mrs. Howard?” Mary breaks out. “How do you do, Mrs. Howard? that is all I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>This</b> afternoon I am taken with a fit of writing; but as to matter, I have nothing better to entertain you, than news of my farm. I therefore give you the following list of the stock of eatables that I am fatting for my private tooth. It is well known to the whole county of Kent, that I have four fat calves, two fat hogs, fit for killing, twelve promising black pigs, two young chickens, three fine geese, with thirteen eggs under each (several being duck-eggs, else the others do not come to maturity); all this, with rabbits, and pigeons, and carp in plenty, beef and mutton at reasonable rates.
