40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the results for}} the {{construction}} of a gold/mercaptobenzothiazole/polyaniline/ acetylcholinesterase/polyvinylacetate (Au/MBT/PANI/AChE/PVAc) thick-film biosensor for the determination of certain carbamate pesticide solutions in selected aqueous organic solvent solutions are reported. AChE biosensors are designed to complement the classical analytical methods of pesticide detection. The Au/MBT/PANI/AChE/PVAc electrocatalytic biosensor device was constructed by encapsulating acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme in the PANI polymer composite, followed by the coating of poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) on top to secure the biosensor film from disintegration in the organic solvents evaluated. The electroactive substrate called acetylthiocholine (ATCh) was employed to provide the movement of electrons in the amperometric biosensor. The voltammetric results have shown that the current shifts more anodically as the Au/MBT/PANI/AChE/PVAc biosensor responded to successive acetylthiocholine (ATCh) substrate addition under anaerobic conditions in 0. 1 M phosphate buffer, KCl (pH 7. 2) solution and aqueous organic solvent solutions. For the Au/MBT/PANI/AChE/PVAc biosensor, various performance and stability parameters were evaluated. These factors include the optimal enzyme loading, effect of pH, long-term stability of the biosensor, temperature stability of the biosensor, the effect of polar organic solvents, and the effect of non-polar organic solvents on the amperometric behavior of the biosensor. The biosensor constructed in this study offered a reasonable linear range between 0. 25 to 3. 45 nM for the detection of carbofuran, aldicarb and <b>dioxacarb</b> pesticide solutions. The detection limits for the individual carbamate pesticides were 0. 249 nM for carbofuran, followed by 1. 209 nM for aldicarb and 1. 572 nM for <b>dioxacarb...</b>|$|E
40|$|A multi-residue {{method for}} the {{simultaneous}} extraction from drinking water using solid-phase extraction on LiChrolut EN [poly(styrene-divinylbenzene), PSDVB] and determination of nine N-methylcarbamate pesticides (NMCs) (aldicarb, its metabolites i. e. aldicarb sulfone and aldicarb sulfoxide and carbaryl, carbofuran, <b>dioxacarb,</b> ethiofencarb, methomyland propoxur) using reversed-phase liquid chromatography was studied. A 1000 -fold pre concentration was achieved and the method {{was used for}} determination of the nine pesticides in water, with limits of detection in the range 3 – 15 ng L− 1. For all compounds the recoveries determined at the 0. 1 and 1 μg L− 1 level generally ranged from 85 to 104 % with relative standard deviations (RSD) of 1. 4 – 8. 8 %...|$|E
