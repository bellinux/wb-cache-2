25|$|Ion etching is a {{sputtering}} {{process that}} can remove very fine quantities of material. This is used to perform a finishing polish of specimens polished by other means. Ion etching uses an inert gas passed through an electric field to generate a plasma stream that is directed to the sample surface. Acceleration energies for gases such as argon are typically a few kilovolts. The sample may be rotated to promote even polishing of the sample surface. The sputtering rate of such methods is {{on the order of}} tens of micrometers per hour, limiting the method to only extremely <b>fine</b> <b>polishing.</b>|$|E

50|$|Chalk may be {{used for}} its {{properties}} as a base. In agriculture, chalk is used for raising pH in soils with high acidity. The most common forms are CaCO3 (calcium carbonate) and CaO (calcium oxide). Small doses of chalk can also be used as an antacid. Additionally, the small particles of chalk make it a substance ideal for cleaning and polishing. For example, toothpaste commonly contains small amounts of chalk, which serves as a mild abrasive.

40|$|The {{flatness}} of a {{silicon carbide}} wafer {{in terms of}} bow and warp {{is the result of}} the combination of factors both material and process related. Sub-surface damage (SSD) from the wafering process steps can be considered as a thin film under compressive stress on the wafer surface. SSD is generally decreased with each subsequent processing step after the multiwire saw. Single-sided process steps can produce very different levels of SSD on opposing wafer surfaces, leading to high bow and warp values. The present study investigates the effects of SSD on wafer flatness at various process steps as well as methods to minimize shape effects due to SSD during and after processing. Introduction.
