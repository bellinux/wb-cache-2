Fledgling American cities, they were connected through an emerging international grain trade of unprecedented proportions.

In spring 1775, famine arose in this new context: before Turgot's edict, every region faced its own shortages, so that some would have suffered a genuine famine while others would have been totally spared and supplied through stable prices; a royal intervention would have been requested, and without a doubt obtained, to assure the supply of the regions most affected. With liberalization, owners of grain started to speculate by storing grain.

A questionnaire was designed to obtain information on the following auger–related topics: recognition of safe practices and appropriate shielding, personal practices and behaviors, risk perception, and personal beliefs. A random sample of 400 Iowa farmers (arrayed by county) was selected to be representative of Iowa farms. The response to the mailed survey was 23 %.

Tighter supply chain management is needed to coordinate the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> from the producer to the end-user, {{and to keep the}} grain identity-preserved (IP). ^ The objectives of this study were: (1) To determine the demand for high oil corn as an input in swine and broiler feed rations; (2) To evaluate the risks and returns to producing high oil corn on cash-grain farms; and (3) To evaluate alternative high oil corn supply chains. ^ A stochastic programming (SP) feed-mix model, incorporating energy and protein content variability, was used to determine the quantity of commodity corn, high oil corn, and choice white grease fed in hog and broiler rations. The ration data generated by the SP model was used to estimate a constant elasticity of substitution demand system for commodity corn, high oil corn, and choice white grease. ^ The cross-price elasticities of demand for commodity corn and high oil corn indicate a high degree of substitution. Because commodity corn and high oil corn are close substitutes, the value of high oil corn is capped by the cost of purchasing commodity corn and choice white grease. ^ A stochastic simulation model was used to compare the per acre return over variable costs for commodity and high oil corn production. The simulation model incorporated yield risk, oil content variability, price risk, and buyer 2 ̆ 7 s call risk. The results indicate that high oil corn does not provide any diversification benefits. Risk averse producers would plant a corn-soybean rotation, while risk neutral producers would plant high oil corn. High oil corn production is a way to increase expected returns, but will not reduce the variability of returns. ^ A price-endogenous model determined market equilibrium prices and demand for commodity corn and high oil corn, and indicated which supply chains handled high oil corn. The results indicated that energy variability in high oil corn limits the demand for high oil corn. The demand for high oil corn diminished as producers demanded more consistent ingredients for their feed rations.

There is a need to understand and quantify sampling uncertainties under varying conditions of contamination.

Relatively recent work by Paoletti et al. provides some insight into the variation in GMO concentrations in soybeans on cargo out-turn. Paoletti et al. analysed the data using correlogram analysis with the objective of quantifying the sampling uncertainty (variance) that attaches to the final cargo analysis, but this is only one possible means of quantifying sampling uncertainty. It is possible that in many cases the levels of contamination passing the sampler on out-loading are essentially random, negating the value of variographic quantitation of the sampling variance. GMOs and mycotoxins appear to have a highly heterogeneous distribution in a cargo depending on how the ship was loaded (the grain may have come from more than one terminal and set of storage silos) and mycotoxin growth may have occurred in transit. This paper examines a statistical model based on random contamination {{that can be used to}} calculate the sampling uncertainty arising from primary sampling of a cargo; it deals with what is thought to be a worst case scenario. The determination of the sampling variance is treated both analytically and by Monte Carlo simulation. The latter approach provides the entire sampling distribution and not just the sampling variance. The sampling procedure is based on rules provided by the Canadian Grain Commission and the levels of contamination considered are those relating to allowable levels of Ochratoxin A (OTA) in wheat. The results of the calculations indicate that at a loading rate of 1000 tonnes per hour, primary sample increment masses of 10. 6 kg, a 2000 tonne lot and a primary composite sample mass of 1900 kg, the relative standard deviation is about 1. 05 (105 %) and the distribution of the mycotoxin (MT) level in the primary composite samples is highly skewed. This result applies to a mean MT level of 2 ng g- 1. The rate of false negative results under these conditions is estimated to be 16. 2 %. The corresponding contamination is based on initial average concentrations of MT of 4000 ng g- 1 within average spherical volumes of 0. 3 m diameter which are then diluted by a factor of two each time they pass through a handling stage; four stages of handling are assumed. The Monte Carlo calculations allow for variation in the initial volume of the MT bearing grain, the average concentration and the dilution factor. The Monte Carlo studies seek to show the effect of variation in the sampling frequency while maintaining a primary composite sample mass of 1900 kg. The overall results are presented in terms of operational characteristic curves that relate only to the sampling uncertainties in the primary sampling of the grain. We conclude that cross-stream sampling in intrinsically unsuited to sampling for mycotoxins and that better sampling methods and equipment are needed to control sampling uncertainties.

This {{study was conducted to}} characterize the quality of grain and feed during bucket elevator handling to meet customer demand for high quality and safe products. Specific objectives were to (1) determine the effect of repeated handling on the quality of feed pellets and corn; (2) characterize the dust generated during corn and wheat handling; (3) develop and evaluate particle models for simulating the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>grain</b> during elevator handling; and (4) accurately simulate grain commingling in elevator boots with discrete element method (DEM). Experiments were conducted at the research elevator of the USDA-ARS Center for Grain and Animal Health Research (CGAHR) to determine the effect of repeated handling on the quality of corn-based feed pellets and corn. Repeated handling did not significantly influence the durability indices of feed pellets and corn. The feed pellets, however, had significantly greater breakage (3. 83 % per transfer) than the corn (0. 382 % per transfer). The mass of particulate matter < 125 μm was less for feed pellets than for corn. These corn-based feed pellets can be an alternative to corn in view of their handling characteristics. Another series of experiments was conducted in the same elevator to characterize the dust generated during corn and wheat handling. Dust samples were collected from the lower and upper ducts upstream of the cyclones in the elevator. Handling corn produced {{more than twice as much}} total dust than handling wheat (185 g/t vs. 64. 6 g/t). Analysis of dust samples with a laser diffraction analyzer showed that the corn samples produced smaller dust particles, and a greater proportion of small particles, than the wheat samples. Published data on material and interaction properties of selected grains and oilseeds that are relevant to DEM modeling were reviewed. Using these material and interaction properties and soybeans as the test material, the DEM fundamentals were validated by modeling the flow of soybean during handling with a commercial software package (EDEM). Soybean kernels were simulated with single- and multi-sphere particle shapes. A single-sphere particle model best simulated soybean kernels in the bulk property tests. The best particle model had a particle coefficient of restitution of 0. 6; particle static friction of 0. 45 for soybean-soybean contact (0. 30 for soybean-steel interaction); particle rolling friction of 0. 05; normal particle size distribution with standard deviation factor of 0. 4; and particle shear modulus of 1. 04 MPa. The single-sphere particle model for soybeans was implemented in EDEM to simulate grain commingling in a pilot-scale bucket elevator boot using 3 D and quasi- 2 D models. Pilot-scale boot experiments of soybean commingling were performed to validate these models. Commingling was initially simulated with a full 3 D model. Of the four quasi- 2 D boot models with reduced control volumes (4 d, 5 d, 6 d, and 7 d; i. e., control volume widths from 4 to 7 times the mean particle diameter) considered, the quasi- 2 D (6 d) model predictions best matched those of the initial 3 D model. Introduction of realistic vibration motion during the onset of clear soybeans improved the prediction capability of the quasi- 2 D (6 d) model. The physics of the model was refined by accounting for the initial surge of particles and reducing the gap between the bucket cups and the boot wall. Inclusion of the particle surge flow and reduced gap gave the best predictions of commingling of all the tested models. This study showed that grain commingling in a bucket elevator boot system can be simulated in 3 D and quasi- 2 D DEM models and gave results that generally agreed with experimental data. The quasi- 2 D (6 d) models reduced simulation run time by 29 % compared to the 3 D model. Results of this study will be used to accurately predict impurity levels and improve grain handling, which can help farmers and grain handlers reduce costs during transport and export of grains and make the U. S. grain more competitive in the world market...|$|E
40|$|Gravitational <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>grains</b> in pipes is {{frequently}} encountered in industry. When the grains and pipes are size-constrained, granular flow {{may result in}} density waves consisting of alternate high- and low-compactness regions. This paper discusses the length scale of density waves that appear when fine grains fall vertically in pipes. A one-dimensional model and a linear stability analysis of the model are presented. The analysis suggests the presence of long-wavelength instability for the most unstable mode, moreover, a cut-off wavenumber from which the length scale is estimated. Finally, the model results are compared to experimental data.

Other processes include rock fall, <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> ice-coasted clasts, <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> dry <b>grains,</b> debris <b>flow</b> and snow avalanches. Other processes that contribute to the formation, but that are of lesser importance, include overland <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> water caused by rain and the combined action of snow and wind.|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} we present an {{experimental}} study of the jamming that stops the free <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>grains</b> from a silo discharging by gravity. When the outlet size is {{not much bigger than}} the beads, granular material jams the outlet of the container due to the formation of an arch. Statistical data from the number <b>of</b> <b>grains</b> fallen between consecutive jams are presented. The information that they provide can help to understand the jamming phenomenon. As the ratio between the size of the orifice {{and the size of the}} beads is increased, the probability that an arch blocks the outlet decreases. We show here that there is a power law divergence of the mean avalanche size for a finite critical radius. Beyond this critical radius no jamming can occur and the flow is never stopped. The dependence of the arch formation on the shape and the material <b>of</b> the <b>grains</b> has been explored. It has been found that the material properties <b>of</b> the <b>grains</b> do not affect the arch formation probability. On the contrary, the shape <b>of</b> the <b>grains</b> deeply influences it. A simple model to interpret the results is also discussed. Comment: Submitted to Phys. Rev. ...|$|R
