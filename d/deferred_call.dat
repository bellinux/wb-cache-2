40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{bandwidth}} allocation scheme which improves degradation of communication quality due to handoffs in mobile multimedia networks. In general, a multimedia call consists of several component calls. For example, a video phone call {{consists of a}} voice call and a video call. In realistic environments, each component call included in one multimedia call may have different requirements for quality-of-service (QoS) from each other, and priorities among these component calls often exist with respect to importance for communications. When the available bandwidth {{is not enough for}} a handoff call, the proposed scheme eliminates a low priority component call and defers bandwidth allocation for a component call whose delay related QoS is not strict. Moreover, in the allocation, the scheme gives priority to new calls and handoff calls over a <b>deferred</b> <b>call</b> and also performs bandwidth reallocation to eliminated component calls. By computer simulation, we evaluate the performance such as call dropping probability and show effectiveness of the proposed scheme...|$|E

40|$|We present {{fundamentals}} of {{an approach to}} object-oriented specification of distributed information systems. We do not assume global time for concurrent object systems. For specifying those systems we propose Dtl, a distributed temporal logic. The main contribution is that Dtl is capable of specifying complex constraints about the behavior of distributed systems and communication between concurrent objects. For instance, we distinguish different kinds of synchronous communication such as immediate <b>calling</b> vs. <b>deferred</b> <b>calling.</b> The ideas are illustrated by examples given in Troll, a formal object-oriented specification language. We introduce notations for formally specifying object-based distributed systems. Finally, we briefly explain how Dtl is semantically {{explained in terms of}} a true concurrent model, i. e., labelled event structures, and which concepts for in-the-large specification are covered by our approach.

All techniques mentioned above are designed for applications running across multiple domains (e. g., multiple processes or multiple nodes in a network). In these techniques, multiple operations are bundled together and then sent to a different domain, where they are executed.

50|$|Accrual {{accounting}} and deferring implies timewise matching(synchronization) {{of income and}} expenses: an incurred cost is capitalized and does not become an expense until it is recognized in the financial statements of the company.

50|$|TinyOS {{is fully}} non-blocking: {{it has one}} call stack. Thus, all input/output (I/O) {{operations}} that last longer than a few hundred microseconds are asynchronous and have a callback. To enable the native compiler to better optimize across call boundaries, TinyOS uses nesC's features to link these callbacks, called events, statically. While being non-blocking enables TinyOS to maintain high concurrency with one stack, it forces programmers to write complex logic by stitching together many small event handlers. To support larger computations, TinyOS provides tasks, which are similar to a <b>Deferred</b> Procedure <b>Call</b> and interrupt handler bottom halves. A TinyOS component can post a task, which the OS will schedule to run later. Tasks are non-preemptive and run in first in, first out order. This simple concurrency model is typically sufficient for I/O centric applications, but its difficulty with CPU-heavy applications has led to developing a thread library for the OS, named TOSThreads.|$|R

While the tool is primarily targeted at students, it should also be valuable to driver developers when debugging real-world problems or as a general purpose function tracer.

Current approaches for resource reservation in Integrated Service Networks adopt an all-or-nothing approach, where partially acquired resources must be released if resources are not available at all routers on the chosen path.

We propose a new approach <b>called</b> <b>Deferred</b> REServation (DRES) that substantially improves performance (reduces the overall flow rejection probability and increases link utilization) over the all-or-nothing reservation approach. Flow admissibility is increased by deferring requests at routers for a limited period of time until resources are available.

We compare the performance of Windows 98 and Windows NT 4. 0 under load from office, multimedia and engineering applications on a personal computer (PC) of modest power that is free of legacy hardware. We report our observations using a complementary pair of system performance measures, interrupt and thread latency, that capture {{the ability of the}} OS to support multimedia and real-time workloads in a way that traditional throughput-based performance measures miss. We use the measured latency distributions to evaluate the quality of service that a WDM driver can expect to receive on both OSs, irrespective of whether the driver uses thread-based or interrupt-based processing. We conclude that for real-time applications a driver on Windows NT 4. 0 that uses high, real-time priority threads receives an order of magnitude better service than a similar WDM driver on Windows 98 that uses <b>Deferred</b> Procedure <b>Calls,</b> a form of interrupt processing.
