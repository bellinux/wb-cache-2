50|$|One {{commercial}} form of <b>Deslorelin</b> Acetate is marketed by Peptech with {{the brand name}} Ovuplant. Another form {{is available in the}} USA, Sucromate Equine, which was FDA-approved for use in horses in November 2010. This is manufactured by Thorne BioScience LLC and was introduced to the USA market following the withdrawal of Ovuplant. The <b>Deslorelin</b> products are currently approved for use in veterinary medicine and to promote ovulation in mares as part of the artificial insemination process. It is also used to stabilize high-risk pregnancies, mainly of livestock. Unlike other GnRH agonists, which are mainly used to inhibit luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone by their ultimate downregulation of the pituitary gland, <b>Deslorelin</b> is primarily used for the initial flare effect upon the pituitary, and its associated surge of LH secretion. Suprelorin is a slowly releasing <b>deslorelin</b> implant used for chemical castration of dogs and ferrets. It is marketed by Virbac. <b>Deslorelin</b> is also used to treat benign prostate hyperplasia in dogs.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the expression of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and progesterone receptor (PR) in normal mammary tissues of bitches before and after the bitch was implanted with the GnRH agonist, <b>deslorelin.</b> Fifteen mature bitches with no pathological condition of the mammary gland, and during anestrus, were selected and divided into two groups: five bitches were implanted with placebo (placebo group); and the ten bitches were implanted with 9. 4 mg <b>deslorelin</b> (<b>deslorelin</b> group). Mammary tissues were collected from all bitches before implantation and at 2 and 12 weeks after implantation. The expressions of ERα and PR were investigated by using immunohistochemistry. The highest scores of both ERα and PR were found at 2 weeks after <b>deslorelin</b> implantation which differed significantly from those of other stages. At 12 weeks after implantation, ERα score decreased to the same level as before implantation while PR score tended to decrease, though not significantly differed from at 2 weeks after implantation. In placebo group, neither difference of ERα nor PR scores was observed at any time of the implantation. This finding indicated that <b>deslorelin</b> may effect the expression of ERα and PR in the bitch mammary tissue, in which it may stimulate the expression of ERα and PR at 2 weeks after <b>deslorelin</b> implantation.

40|$|Young bulls {{were treated}} with graded dosages of the LHRH agonist <b>deslorelin</b> to {{ascertain}} 1) whether increased testosterone secretion persisted over a wide dose range of agonist; 2) whether elevated testosterone was maintained long-term and, if so, what effects there were on reproductive function; and 3) what pituitary responses to exogenous LHRH occurred in intact and castrated bulls receiving <b>deslorelin.</b> In three experiments, bulls received dosages of agonist ranging from approximately 0. 15 to 29. 0. g deslorelin/kg live weight/ day, by means of either bioimplants or injections. At all dosages, <b>deslorelin</b> induced an acute increase in plasma LH concentrations that declined after 24 h but remained at greater concentrations than in controls, although the differences were relatively small. Profiles of LH in bulls treated with <b>deslorelin</b> were characterized by tonic secretion with no clear evidence of LH pulses. Plasma testosterone concentra-tions were increased at all dosages of <b>deslorelin</b> and in one experiment remained greater than in controls for over 100 days of treatment. This increase was associated {{with an increase in}} the rate of testis growth; however, there were no apparent improvements in semen parameters. Bulls receiving <b>deslorelin</b> did not show a typical postcastration rise in plasma LH concentrations, and neither intact nor castrated bulls receiving <b>deslorelin</b> showed an increase in plasma LH after injection of natural sequence LHRH. The absence of endogenous LH pulses and lack of response to exogenous LHRH suggested that the anterior pituitary in bulls receiving LHRH agonist becomes desen-sitized. However, LH secretion persisted in a tonic manner and was associated with elevated plasma testosterone concentrations. The failure of both intact and castrated bulls receiving <b>deslorelin</b> to respond to exogenous LHRH suggested direct effects of <b>deslorelin</b> on the pituitary, rather than an interaction with steroid feedback...|$|E

40|$|<b>Deslorelin</b> acetate implants, {{recently}} licensed in Ireland and the UK for ovulation induction in mares, {{have been}} associated with prolonged interovulatory intervals in USA studies, leading to the practice of removing implants postovulation. Trial data in Australia indicate a less pronounced effect on interovulatory intervals, suggesting possible geographical variation. Objectives of the current study were to assess the effect of <b>deslorelin</b> implants, with and without removal on oestrous cycle length in Irish- and UK-based Thoroughbred broodmares. Data were collected retrospectively from 88 oestrous cycles. A statistically significant difference (P= 0. 02) was found between interovulatory intervals in mares in which the <b>deslorelin</b> implant was not removed, compared with administration and removal of the implant or the use of human chorionic gonadotrophin. The results suggest that implant removal when possible is advisable. The delay in subsequent ovulations was less marked than that reported in some studies from the USA. This information is useful in deciding when to schedule subsequent breeding for mares which received a <b>deslorelin</b> implant during the previous oestrous period and provides evidence to counter-concerns that mares treated with <b>deslorelin</b> implants may experience a long delay in return to oestrus if the implant is not removed...|$|E
40|$|Fertility control {{represents}} a proactive approach to population management for various mammalian wildlife species. In large predators, <b>deslorelin</b> implants {{have proven to}} be useful contraceptives in species such as lions, tigers and cheetahs. Although female lions and tigers responded well to various doses of <b>deslorelin,</b> the 9. 4 mg implants at 48 -month intervals are recommended for treatment of these species. In cheetahs both sexes could be effectively down-regulated using annual 4. 7 mg implants. It does however, appear that certain species, like the African wild dog, are more difficult to down-regulate than others. Whether this relates to differences in peripheral <b>deslorelin</b> concentrations achieved or to actual concentrations at the effector site is unknown. Determining peripheral <b>deslorelin</b> concentrations in species like the lion, cheetah and wild dog may provide some answers. LH response to GnRH stimulation at various intervals after <b>deslorelin</b> treatment may also be informative.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} {{of one or}} multiple doses of an injectable formulation of <b>deslorelin</b> (a GnRH agonist) was evaluated to induce estrus in anestrous bitches. Thirteen animals composed three groups: group 1 (n= 5, single IM injection of 2 mg <b>deslorelin),</b> group 2 (n= 5, four IM injections of 2 mg <b>deslorelin</b> in alternate days), and control group (n= 3, four IM saline injections in alternate days). Daily clinical evaluations, sexual behavior, vaginal cytology, plasma progesterone concentration, ovaryhysterectomy and macroscopic evaluation of the uterus and ovaries were done. In group 1, none of the bitches showed signs of estrus, while two developed clinical signs and vaginal cytology of proestrus. In group 2, all animals presented proestrus, four presented estrus, and three ovulated; resulting in a functional corpus luteum and high progesterone concentration until day 25 of diestrus, when ovaryhysterectomy was performed. The duration of the stages of <b>deslorelin</b> induced cycles and the progesterone profile {{were similar to those}} described in the literature, and no side effects were observed.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effects of slow-release implants containing the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist <b>deslorelin</b> on reproduction in the common brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). Captive female brushtail possums were assigned to control (placebo implant), low dose (4. 7 mg <b>deslorelin)</b> or high dose (9. 4 mg <b>deslorelin)</b> groups; males were assigned to control or high dose (9. 4 mg <b>deslorelin)</b> groups. The acute effects of <b>deslorelin</b> treatment {{at the level of}} the pituitary gland were similar between the two sexes, where a transient rise in luteinising hormone concentration was induced over the first 24 h. In females, this was associated with the disruption of the normal oestrous cycle and mating within 2 – 10 days in some treated individuals, but no young were subsequently detected. By 3 weeks after treatment, treated females became anoestrus and remained infertile for at least one breeding season. The effects of treatment were reversible in a subset of females that had their implants removed, although the time taken to produce offspring was variable. Paradoxically, male brushtail possums remained fertile during chronic <b>deslorelin</b> exposure. Despite significant declines in basal follicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone concentrations, as well as an inability to respond to a GnRH challenge, treated males sired as many offspring as control males and there was no evidence of testicular regression. In conclusion, there is potential to control reproduction in female brushtail possums by using chronic GnRH agonist treatment. 11 page(s...|$|E
40|$|<b>Deslorelin</b> is a {{synthetic}} GnRH analogue, {{which is being}} used as a contraceptive in animals by acting as a gonadal suppressant.   The product Suprelorin (Virbac, Australia) contains <b>deslorelin</b> as a biocompatible, slow release subcutaneous implant.

40|$|In Europe, the yellow-bellied slider (Trachemys scripta sp.) is a {{non-native}} {{species in}} competition with native freshwater turtles. Research on contraception could be useful to control the captive population.

The objective {{of the current study}} was to evaluate the effects of a single 4. 7 -mg <b>deslorelin</b> acetate implant on plasma testosterone concentrations in yellow-bellied sliders (Trachemys scripta sp.). Eleven adult male yellow-bellied sliders were used for the study. Males from the treatment group (n = 6) received a 4. 7 -mg <b>deslorelin</b> acetate implant, whereas males from the control group (n = 5) did not receive any treatment.

No difference between the control group and the <b>deslorelin</b> treatment group was observed at T 0, T 2, T 3, T 4, T 5 or T 6. However, mean plasma testosterone concentration was significantly higher in the treatment group than in the control group at T 1. This suggests that treatment with a 4. 7 -mg <b>deslorelin</b> acetate implant has a transient stimulatory effect on the anterior pituitary in yellowbellied sliders without a negative feedback on testosterone production.

40|$|Populations of Australian {{marsupials}} {{can become}} overabundant, resulting in detrimental {{impacts on the}} environment. For example, the threatened black-flanked rock-wallaby (Petrogale lateralis lateralis) has previously been perceived as overabundant and thus ‘unwanted’ when they graze crops and cause habitat degradation. Hormonally-induced fertility control has been increasingly used to manage population size in other marsupials where alternative management options are not viable. We tested whether <b>deslorelin,</b> a superagonist of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), would suppress reproduction in free-living adult female rock-wallabies without adversely impacting body condition. We trapped, synchronised reproduction and allocated female rock-wallabies to a placebo implant (control, n = 22), one (n = 22) or two (n = 20) subcutaneous implants of <b>deslorelin.</b> Females were then recaptured over the following 36 months to monitor reproduction, including Luteinising Hormone levels, and body condition. Following treatment, diapaused blastocysts reactivated in five females and the resulting young were carried through to weaning. No wallabies treated with <b>deslorelin,</b> conceivede a new young for at least 27 months. We did not observe adverse effects on body condition on treated females. We conclude that <b>deslorelin</b> implants are effective for the medium-term suppression of reproduction in female black-flanked rock-wallabies and for managing overabundant populations of some marsupials...|$|E

This study investigated the behavioural effects of <b>deslorelin</b> implants in female eastern grey kangaroos. Treatment had no detectable effects on crepuscular activity. Alterations in the frequency of sexual interactions were observed in deslorelin-treated females, with a behavioural oestrus induced ~ 3 days after combined removal of pouch young and <b>deslorelin</b> administration.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate clinical efficacy of <b>deslorelin</b> for inhibiting reproduction in the bitch. Ten adult healthy bitches or bitches with mammary neoplasia for which owners were requesting suppression of cyclicity without performing gonadectomy were administered a 4. 7 - or a 9. 4 -mg <b>deslorelin</b> implant subcutaneously. The first implant of <b>deslorelin</b> was administered in anoestrus (n = 5) or in dioestrus (n = 5).

Some of the bitches implanted in anoestrus came in heat within 4 - 15 days after treatment, while none of the bitches implanted in dioestrus showed heat during treatment. Suppression of reproductive cyclicity was successfully achieved in 6 / 10 bitches for 1 - 4 years. No behavioural and local/general side-effects were observed in any of the treated bitches. The 4. 7 -mg <b>deslorelin</b> implant may work well for suppression of cyclicity provided that it is administered in dioestrus and at intervals of 4. 5 months.

40|$|Female cattle (heifers) {{treated with}} <b>deslorelin,</b> an agonist of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone(GnRH), {{typically}} show a biphasic gonadotrophin response to treatment. During the acute phase (0 to 24 h), plasma concentrations of luteinising hormone (LH) are elevated. The acute phase {{is followed by}} GnRH receptor downregulation in the anterior pituitary gland, and the pituitary becomes desensitised to natural sequence GnRH. Heifers treated chronically with <b>deslorelin</b> therefore do not have pulsatile secretion of LH. However, heifers treated chronically with <b>deslorelin</b> commencing early in the oestrous cycle (Day 3), typically had elevated plasma concentrations of progesterone during the luteal phase compared with contemporary untreated heifers. It is unlikely that increased plasma progesterone in heifers treated with <b>deslorelin,</b> commencing early in the oestrous cycle, is due to ovulation {{in response to the}} acute rise in plasma LH, and subsequent formation of an accessory corpus luteum. The increase in plasma progesterone in these treated heifers might be due, therefore, to changes in patterns of LH secretion, which are accompanied by changes in the size and/or function of the corpus luteum. Heifers treated with <b>deslorelin</b> commencing later in the oestrous cycle may be induced to ovulate and develop an accessory corpus luteum. The aim in Experiments 1 and 2 of this thesis was to characterise LH secretion, and determine changes in size and steroidogenic activity of the corpus luteum, in heifers treated chronically with <b>deslorelin,</b> commencing on Day 3 of the oestrous cycle. Steroidogenic activity was ascertained by measuring tissue contents of progesterone, steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein and the key steroidogenic enzymes, cytochrome P 450 scc (P 450 scc) and 3 ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, ∆⁵-∆⁴ isomerase (3 ß-HSD). The recently described StAR protein facilitates the transport of cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane of steroidogenic cells, where P 450 scc is localised. Transport of cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane is considered the ratelimiting step in steroidogenesis in all steroidogenic tissues. A further aim in the thesis was to determine the relationship between stage of the oestrous cycle (i. e. stage of the ovarian follicular wave) and the ability of <b>deslorelin</b> to induce ovulation during the acilte LH response phase. In Experiment 1, stage of the oestrous cycle was synchronised in randomly cycling Brahman heifers, using a standard progest-agen treatment. On Day 3 of the ensuing oestrous cycle, heifers were assigned to: Control (n= 9), no treatment; <b>Deslorelin</b> (n= 9), implanted subcutaneously with GnRH agonist (<b>deslorelin)</b> bioimplants. Heifers treated with <b>deslorelin</b> received approximately 25 µg deslorelin/kg live weight/ 24 h). Blood samples for LH and progesterone analyses were taken immediately before implanting (Day 0) and 6 hours later, and on Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10. On Day 10 of treatment (Day 13 of the oestrous cycle), all heifers were ovariectomised and the corpus luteum dissected from the ovary and weighed. Immediately after ovariectomy, all heifers received an injection of natural sequence GnRH (50 µg i. m.) and blood samples were taken at 0 and 30 min to determine pituitary LH release. Progesterone content of the corpus luteum was determined by radioimmunoassay. Contents of StAR protein, P 450 scc, and 3 ß-HSD were determined using Western Blot analyses. Experiment 2 was similar in design to Experiment 1, except that heifers treated with <b>deslorelin</b> received approximately 50 µg deslorelin/kg live weight/ 24 h. Also, in Experiment 2, heifers were bled on Days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10. The trends in the treatment responses were similar for Experiments 1 and 2 and pooled data are presented below. Treatment with <b>deslorelin</b> caused an acute increase in the plasma concentration of LH and, at 6 h after implanting, treated heifers had greater (P< 0. 01) plasma LH (1. 4 ± 0. 1 ng/ml) than control heifers (0. 6 ± 0. 1 ng/ml). Plasma LH in implanted heifers had declined by Day 1; however, mean LH from Day 1 to 10 of treatment was greater (P< 0. 01) for implanted heifers (0. 8 ± 0. 1 ng/ml) than control heifers (0. 5 ± 0. 1 ng/ml). On Day 10, control heifers had an increase (P< 0. 01) in plasma LH after injection of GnRH (∆LH 1. 73 ± 0. 23 ng/ml), but this did not occur in heifers implanted with <b>deslorelin</b> (∆LH 0. 11 ± 0. 08 ng/ml). Plasma progesterone concentrations increased from Day 0 to Day 10 for both control heifers and heifers treated with <b>deslorelin.</b> On Day 10, plasma progesterone was greater (P< 0. 01) for heifers implanted with <b>deslorelin</b> (18. 9 ± 3. 5 ng/ml) than control heifers (9. 1 ± 1. 3 ng/ml). Corpus luteum weight was greater (P< 0. 05) for implanted (4. 2 ± 0. 4 g) than control (3. 1 ± 0. 2 g) heifers. The amount of progesterone per corpus luteum was also greater (P 0. 01 l) for treated heifers (164 ± 20 µg per corpus luteum) than control heifers (88 ± 13 µg per corpus luteum). The amount of StAR protein per total corpus luteum was greater (P< 0. 05) for heifers treated with <b>deslorelin</b> (2. 2 ± 0. 3 arbitrary units) than control heifers (1. 2 ± 0. 2 arbitrary units). The relative content of StAR protein per unit weight of corpus luteum was greater in treated heifers (1. 8 ± 0. 3 arbitrary units/g) compared with control heifers (1. 5 ± 0. 1 arbitrary units/g), but this difference was not significant. The relative content of P 450 scc per total corpus luteum was greater (P< 0. 01) in treated heifers (2. 2 ± 0. 2 arbitrary units) compared with control heifers (1. 4 ± 0. 2 arbitrary units). The relative content of P 450 scc per unit weight corpus luteum was also greater (P< 0. 05) in treated heifers (1. 9 ± 0. 2 arbitrary units/g) compared with control heifers (1. 2 ± 0. 1 arbitrary units/g). Relative content of 3 ß-HSD per unit weight of corpus luteum tissue tended to be greater (Experiment 1 : P= 0. 09; Experiment 2 : P= 0. 72) in heifers treated with <b>deslorelin</b> (1. 57 ± 0. 15 arbitrary units/g) than in control heifers (1. 49 ± 0. 15 arbitrary units/g) but this was not significant. Relative content of 3 ß-HSD per total corpus luteum likewise tended to be greater (P= 0. 20) in heifers treated with <b>deslorelin</b> (1. 91 ± 0. 25 arbitrary units) than in control heifers (1. 51 ± 0. 28 arbitrary units), but this also was not significant. In Experiment 3, stage of the oestrous cycle was synchronised in Brahman heifers, which were in random stages of the oestrous cycle, using a standard progestagen treatment. Heifers were then assigned to: Control (n= 4), no treatment; or implanted with <b>deslorelin</b> (50 µLg/kg live weight/ 24 h) on different days of the oestrous cycle: D 2 (n= 4) implanted on Day 2; D 4 (n= 4) implanted on Day 4; D 6 (n= 4) implanted on Day 6; or D 8 (n= 4), implanted on Day 8 of the oestrous cycle. Ovarian follicle and corpus luteum status were monitored using ultrasonography for approximately 40 days. Heifers treated with <b>deslorelin</b> commencing on Day 2 of the oestrous cycle had follicles with a maximum diameter of 4. 7 ± 0. 3 mm at the time of treatment and did not ovulate or develop an accessory corpus luteum. The diameter of the largest follicle on Day 4 of the oestrous cycle was 6. 5 ± 0. 7 mm and two of four heifers ovulated and developed an accessory corpus luteum. The diameters of the two follicles that ovulated were 5. 0 and 6. 0 mm, while those that did not ovulate were 6. 0 and 7. 0 mm. On Day 6 of the oestrous cycle, each of the heifers had a 10 mm follicle that ovulated and developed an accessory corpus luteum. Heifers treated with <b>deslorelin</b> on Day 8 of the oestrous cycle had a relatively large follicle (8. 63 ± 0. 94 rum), but no heifers in this group ovulated. In 4 of 6 heifers that ovulated and developed an accessory corpus luteum, the spontaneous corpus luteum persisted for 11 to 19 days longer than the spontaneous corpus luteum in control heifers, even after the accessory corpus luteum had regressed. The induced corpus luteum may have increased PGF₂∝ receptors, or increased numbers of large luteal cells in the corpus luteum. Also, the presence of two corpora lutea might have produced sufficient oxytocin to cause downregulation of endometrial oxytocin receptors. The acute increase in plasma concentration of LH subsequent to implantation of heifers with <b>deslorelin</b> was consistent with previous findings. The rise in plasma LH was sufficient to induce ovulation of follicles of relatively small diameter (5 to 6 mm). This observation indicated that LH receptors sufficient for a response to a preovulatory LH surge are expressed in 6 - 7 mm follicles in Brahman (Bos indicus) heifers. Basal concentrations of plasma LH were consistently greater in heifers receiving <b>deslorelin</b> compared with untreated heifers. Increased basal LH in heifers treated with <b>deslorelin</b> was associated with greater concentrations of plasma progesterone. Because heifers treated with <b>deslorelin</b> would not have pulsatile secretion of LH, it could be concluded that basal secretion of LH is an important determinant of corpus luteum function and progesterone secretion in cattle. Heifers treated with <b>deslorelin</b> also had a larger corpus luteum and increased corpus luteum contents of StAR protein and P 450 scc. The latter findings are the first demonstration of concomitant increases in progesterone secretion, size of the corpus luteum and steroidogenic activity of luteal cells in a female mammal treated with GnRH agonist. Progesterone is required for the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy in cattle, and it is possible that treatment with a GnRH agonist may stimulate increased progesterone secretion sufficient to enhance conceptions to artificial insemination and embryo transfer in cattle...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} was to evaluate ovarian activity reversibility in domestic queens after short-term contraceptive treatment with <b>deslorelin</b> acetate. Ten mature queens were used. In all queens, the estrous cycle was evaluated every 72 h by vaginal cytology (VC) and behavior assessments. When queens had VC characteristic of interestrus or diestrus, one <b>deslorelin</b> acetate implant (4. 7 mg) {{was placed in the}} subcutaneous tissue of the interscapular region (day of insertion = Day 0). Thereafter, VC was performed every 48 h and on Day 90, implants were removed. At Day 100, estrus and ovulation were induced with 100 IU eCG (im), followed by 100 IU hCG (im), 84 h later (Day 103. 5). Queens were ovariohysterectomized on Day 106. Corpora lutea (CL) were counted, oviducts were flushed, and oocytes were identified, isolated and stained to assess viability. In all queens, blood samples for plasma progesterone concentrations were collected once a week, from Days − 21 to 106. After <b>deslorelin</b> acetate application, four queens had VC and behavior typical of estrus, and one ovulated. Furthermore, ovulation occurred in three queens that did not have VC or behavior consistent with estrus. After the initial ovarian stimulation, all females had anestrous VC during the <b>deslorelin</b> treatment period. Implants were readily removed. Following implant removal, all females responded to treatments to induce estrus and ovulation. There were (mean ± SEM) 13. 1 ± 5. 5 CL and 8. 1 ± 5. 5 oocytes per queen; the oocyte recovery rate was 56. 8 ± 25. 4 % and all recovered oocytes were viable.

" [...] abstractThe aims in this thesis were: (1) to characterise ovarian function in heifers and cows treated long-term with the GnRH agonist deslorelin; and (2) to evaluate the potential of controlled-release <b>deslorelin</b> implants for the prevention of pregnancy in heifers and cows maintained in extensive environments. Study 1 : The first study was conducted on three cattle stations. On Station 1, a total of 100 heifers and cows each received a GnRH agonist implant that contained 12 mg <b>deslorelin.</b> On Stations 2 and 3, a total of 168 heifers and cows each received a GnRH agonist implant that contained 8 mg <b>deslorelin.</b> The heifers and cows used at the three locations were confirmed non-pregnant {{at the start of the}} study. Animals were managed under standard conditions as single groups on each station. Bulls (4 %) were kept with females for the duration of the study. Control, untreated heifers and cows were included at each site to confirm that bulls were not limiting to fertility in each herd. Pregnancy and time of conception were estimated based on foetal size as determined by rectal palpation. Pregnancy rates at Station 1 (12 mg implant) were: heifers (n= 50), 0 % at 6 months and 10 % at 11 months; cows (n= 50), 0 % at 6 months and 6 % at 11 months. Pregnancy rates at Station 2 (8 mg implant) were: heifers (n= 41), 0 % at 6 months and 10 % at 12 months; cows (n= 48), 4 % at 6 months and 12 % at 12 months. On Station 3 (8 mg implant) pregnancy rates were: heifers (n= 40), 8 % at 6 months and 28 % at 11 months; cows (n= 37), 8 % at 6 months and 24 % at 11 months. Pregnancy rates for control cattle at Station 1 were: heifers (n= 10), 50 % at 6 months and 800 / 0 (new group introduced at 6 months, n= 10) at 11 months; cows (n= 10), 100 % at 6 months and 80 % (new group introduced at 6 months, n= 10) at 11 months. Pregnancy rates for control cattle at Station 2 were: heifers (n= 8), 12 % at 6 months and 62 % at 12 months; cows (n= 11), 64 % at 6 months and 91 % at 12 months. On Station 3 pregnancy rates for control cattle were: heifers (n= 10), 78 % at 6 months and 60 % (new group introduced at 9 months, n= 10) at 11 months; cows (n= 10), 100 % at 6 months, and no further control cows were introduced. At the completion of field observations at 12 months treated animals were slaughtered to determine pregnancy status and characteristics of ovaries and reproductive tracts. Final pregnancy data and estimated average number of days to first conception for deslorelin-treated cattle were: Station 1 (n= 99), 9 % pregnant and 336 ± 3 days; Station 2 (n= 76), 26 % pregnant and 231 ± 19 days; Station 3 (n= 84), 10 % pregnant and 244 ± 13 days. Treatment with a <b>deslorelin</b> implant in heifers and cows restricted ovarian follicular growth to early antral follicles (1 - 2 rom diameter), as observed by ultrasound scanning. Study 2 In Study 1, the return to normal fertility in heifers and cows treated with a <b>deslorelin</b> implant appeared to be related to increased pasture availability and accelerated rate of live weight gain, which may put the cattle in a better condition to achieve pregnancy. Study 2 : was designed to specifically examine whether treatment with a <b>deslorelin</b> implant suppressed ovarian function for at least 12 months in heifers gaining live weight at a relatively fast rate. GnRH agonist implants that contained three doses of <b>deslorelin</b> were used in Study 2. A group of 198 heifers showing oestrous cycles at regular intervals were assigned to one of four groups: Control (n= 50), not treated; GnRH agonist-low dose (n= 50), 3 mg deslorelin; GnRH agonist-medium dose (n= 50), 6 mg deslorelin; GnRH agonist-high dose (n= 48), 12 mg <b>deslorelin.</b> All heifers and four bulls were maintained on natural pastures. Ultrasonography at monthly intervals was used to monitor ovarian follicular activity, corpus luteum development, conception and maintenance of pregnancy. During the 12 -month study, heifers gained 153 ± 3 kg which was approximately 0. 4 kg/day. The duration of suppression of ovarian activity was related to the dose of <b>deslorelin</b> in the implants. The 3 mg <b>deslorelin</b> implant suppressed ovarian activity for 3 months with cumulative pregnancies of 40 / 0 at 4 months, 57 % at 8 months and 75 % at 12 months. The 6 mg <b>deslorelin</b> implant suppressed nonnal ovarian function for 5 months with cumulative pregnancies of 2 %, 36 % and 54 % at 4, 8 and 12 months, respectively. The 12 mg <b>deslorelin</b> implant suppressed ovarian cyclicity for almost 12 months with 6 % cumulative pregnancies at 12 months. Pregnancies in control heifers, that were replaced at regular intervals, occurred throughout the study confirming that bulls were not limiting in fertility. In summary, <b>deslorelin</b> implants were found to suppress ovarian activity in heifers and cows. The duration of suppression of ovarian activity was related to dose of GnRH agonist. Treatment with a GnRH agonist implant that contained 12 mg <b>deslorelin</b> prevented pregnancies for up to 12 months in heifers undergoing continuing live weight gain. The thesis has shown that GnRH agonist implants have the potential for use as a non-surgical technique for the prevention of pregnancies in heifers and cows in extensive beef production systems typical of northern Australia...|$|E
40|$|Wild Canis {{species such}} as the coyote (C. latrans) express a suite of {{reproductive}} traits unusual among mammals, including perennial pair-bonds and paternal care of the young. Coyotes also are monestrous, and both sexes are fertile only in winter; thus, they depend upon social and physiologic synchrony for successful reproduction. To investigate the mutability of seasonal reproduction in coyotes, we attempted to evoke an out-of-season estrus in October using one of two short-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agents: (1) a GnRH analogue, <b>deslorelin</b> (6 -D-tryptophan- 9 -(N-ethyl-L-prolinamide) - 10 -deglycinamide), 2. 1 mg pellet sc; or (2) gonadorelin, a GnRH (5 -oxoPro-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Leu-Arg-Pro-GlyNH 2) porcine hypothalamic extract, 2. 0 mg/kg im once daily for 3 consecutive days. A transient increase in serum concentrations of estradiol and progesterone (1 and 2 wk, respectively) was detected after treatment with <b>deslorelin</b> but not gonadorelin. Also, socio-sexual behaviors reminiscent of winter mating (including courtship, mate-guarding, precoital mounts, and copulatory ties) were observed among the <b>deslorelin</b> group. During the subsequent breeding season (January and February), however, preovulatory courtship behavior and olfactory sampling appeared suppressed; emergence of mounts and copulations were delayed in both <b>deslorelin</b> and gonadorelin treatment groups. Furthermore, whereas 8 of 12 females treated in October ovulated and produced healthy litters in the spring, 4 naive coyotes failed to copulate or become pregnant. Thus, perturbation of hormones prior to ovulation in species with complex mating behaviors may disrupt critical intrapair relationships, even if fertility is not impaired physiologically...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} ten years, {{numerous}} species have been treated with <b>deslorelin</b> implants to induce contraception. The aims {{of the study were}} 1) to assess contraceptive efficacy of 4. 7 mg subcutaneous <b>deslorelin</b> implants in rats, 2) to determine the latency of contraceptive effect, and 3) to determine potential side effects. Three experimental females were implanted and their estrous cycle was studied by vaginal smear. Two weeks after implantation, a male whose fertility was previously assessed with a control female, was introduced into their cage. No female conceived during the 4 mo following implantation. Additionally, 38 pet rats were recruited from clients in practice to test for potential side effects, including 6 males and 32 females {{with a mean age of}} 14 mo. Local reaction and transient weight gain during the first 2 wk, as well as behavioral changes were recorded. According to this pilot study, <b>deslorelin</b> implant could be used as a contraceptive method in female rats. The latency period is about 2 wk. Nevertheless, it might be possible to refine the treatment further using hormonal measurements. The duration of contraceptive effect is to be determined in an upcoming study...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the potential of}} slow-release GnRH agonist (<b>deslorelin)</b> implants to inhibit reproductive function in the male tammar wallaby. The specific aim was to measure the effects of graded dosages of <b>deslorelin</b> on testes size and plasma LH and testosterone concentrations. Adult male tammar wallabies were assigned to four groups (n = 6 per group) and received the following treatment: control, placebo implant; low dose, 5 mg deslorelin; medium dose, 10 mg; high dose, 20 mg. All dosages of <b>deslorelin</b> induced acute increases (P < 0. 001) in plasma LH and testosterone concentrations within 2 h, with concentrations remaining elevated during the first 24 h but returning to pretreatment levels by Day 7. Thereafter, {{there was no evidence}} of a treatment-induced decline in plasma testosterone concentrations. There was no detectable difference in basal LH concentrations between treated and control animals, nor was there a significant change in testes width or length (P < 0. 05). These results suggest that the male tammar wallaby is resistant to the contraceptive effects of chronic GnRH agonist treatment. Despite the maintenance of testosterone secretion, the majority of male tammars (10 of 17) failed to respond to a GnRH challenge with a release of LH between Days 186 and 197 of treatment. The failure of animals to respond to exogenous GnRH suggests a direct effect of <b>deslorelin</b> on the pituitary, resulting in a level of desensitization that was sufficient to inhibit a LH surge but insufficient to inhibit basal LH secretion. The variation between animals is believed to result from earlier recovery of some individuals, in particular those that received a lower dose, or individual resistance to the desensitization process. 7 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Objectives The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess {{efficacy}} of <b>deslorelin,</b> a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist marketed in Europe for the control of male dog reproduction, for the postponement of puberty in queens. Methods Nine prepubertal queens aged 3 - 9 months were selected for this study; their general and reproductive health was checked through clinical, haematological, vaginal cytology and hormonal tests. Following treatment with a 4. 7 mg <b>deslorelin</b> implant each cat received a monthly clinical examination and blood was collected for hormonal assay every third month. Cats were monitored for 14. 1 ± 5. 2 (range 7 - 23) months. Results All cats were in good body condition and normal health prior to treatment. Their health status remained unchanged throughout the study and no significant variation was observed with regard to serum progesterone or oestradiol. Seven days post treatment 1 / 9 queens showed signs of heat, and one other queen showed complete vaginal keratinisation. No other signs of heat were subsequently observed in any other queen. Five queens were lost during the study after 7, 7, 16, 17 and 18 months of observation (during which time they did not show signs of heat). By the end of the study no sign of puberty was observed in the four remaining queens at 21 - 36 months of age. Conclusions and relevance A 4. 7 mg <b>deslorelin</b> implant was able to suppress the feline pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to postponement of puberty for up to 21 - 36 months in the four queens that completed the study. <b>Deslorelin</b> can be considered as a safe method to postpone puberty in queens...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTHigh milk production, heat, {{physiological}} {{status and}} management impair reproduction in Holstein cows. The use of in vivo-produced embryos {{has been reported}} {{as an alternative to}} enhance pregnancy outcome in the tropics; however there are several limitations for its production, especially from variations in superovulatory responses. The in vitro production of embryos would avoid such variations, but few studies have been reported. This study aims to verify the effects of variables related to recipients under a program of routine in vitro embryo transfer on a commercial dairy farm in southeastern Brazil. It was hypothesized that pregnancy rates after transfer of ovum pick up or OPUderived embryos (ET) to lactating Holstein recipients may be influenced by recipient GnRH-treatment at ET, parity, milk production and body condition score. Recipients (267) were allocated to one of three i. m. treatments given at ET: Control (92) - 2. 5 ml saline; Buserelin (86) - 10 &# 956;g Buserelin acetate; <b>Deslorelin</b> (89) - 750 &# 956;g <b>Deslorelin</b> acetate. Ultrasound images and blood samples were taken at ET and seven days later. The first pregnancy diagnosis was performed between 30 - 40 days and the second between 60 - 80 days post ET. Data were analyzed by GENMOD (SAS(r)). The proportion of pregnant cows was greater (P< 0. 05) in Buserelin-treated recipients (38. 3 %) at the first pregnancy diagnosis than Controls (24. 1 %), but similar to <b>Deslorelin</b> and control cows at the second diagnosis (13. 0, 20. 9 and 14. 6 % in Control, Buserelin and <b>Deslorelin,</b> respectively). In conclusion, Buserelin improved pregnancy rate only transitorily, under the present conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{best known}} way of {{controlling}} or changing the behaviour of male dogs is through surgical castration. However, {{this method is}} not always very effective and above all irreversible. Therefore, a reversible alternative that results in behavioural changes comparable to the changes seen after surgical castration is desirable. GnRH-agonist implants can be this alternative. A lot of different agonists {{have been used in}} the past for the temporary castration of male animals for research purposes. Nowadays, the GnRH agonist used most in male dogs is <b>deslorelin.</b> The effect of chemical castration on the behaviour of male dogs is not very clear yet. It is interesting to know if this effect is comparable with the effect of surgical castration on the behaviour. A pilot study has been done to see if the results of chemical castration with <b>deslorelin</b> are promising. In this study 21 dogs were used. The owners of treated dogs received a questionnaire. The majority of dogs showed major behavioural changes after chemical castration with <b>deslorelin</b> implants. Depending on the specific behaviour, the effect of <b>deslorelin</b> on behaviour was however very diverse. Inter-male aggression did not apply or decreases, urine marking stayed the same or decreased. A complete reduction could be seen when regarding preputial infection and sexual behaviour like mounting people or other dogs. Some owners reported that their dog responded better to commands, were calmer and/or showed an increase in play behaviour. A reduction of testis circumference was seen in the majority of dogs. Because of these positive results a study has been started to determine the effect of a chemical castration on the behaviour of intact male dogs using the GnRH agonist <b>deslorelin</b> (4, 7 mg/implant). Furthermore, it is important to determine if this effect is comparable with the effect of surgical castration on the behaviour of male dogs. For this study 44 dogs will be used, they will be divided in 2 groups of 22 dogs each: a chemical castration and a surgical castration group. The dogs will be subjected to a behavioural test and a GnRH challenge test before and after the chemical castration. The owners will receive a questionnaire about their dogs behaviour before and after the chemical castration. Furthermore, the owners will receive a follow-up questionnaire by phone on 4 different moments following the chemical castration (1, 3, 5 and 7 weeks). This is an ongoing study. The results of the telephonic follow-up questionnaire of 6 dogs are used in this paper to give a report of the initial results. The majority of these 6 dogs showed an increase in general agility and play behaviour after chemical castration. The effect on inter-male aggression was not very uniform, however, a decline seemed to be the tendency. A complete reduction was seen regarding preputial infection and sexual behaviour like mounting people or other dogs. Furthermore, the majority of dogs showed an increase in appetite. A reduction of testis circumference was observed by the owner in all of the dogs. Most changes started around the 3 rd week after chemical castration. The results of the pilot study and the telephonic follow-up questionnaire are comparable. Furthermore, the effect of a chemical castration using <b>deslorelin</b> on the behaviour of male dogs seems to be comparable with the effect of a surgical castration when literature is compared with the results of this paper. The <b>deslorelin</b> implant could be considered a suitable and above all reversible alternative for surgical castration in male dogs...|$|E
40|$|Determining the {{presence}} of functional gonadal tissue in dogs can be challenging, especially in bitches during anestrus or not {{known to have been}} ovariectomized, or in male dogs with nonscrotal testes. Furthermore, in male dogs treated with <b>deslorelin,</b> a slow-release GnRH agonist implant for reversible chemical castration, the verification of complete downregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis can be difficult, especially if pretreatment parameters such as the size of the testes or prostate gland are not available. The aims of this study were to validate an immunoradiometric assay for measurement of FSH in canine urine, to determine if the urinary FSH to creatinine ratio can be used to verify the neuter status in bitches and male dogs, {{as an alternative to the}} plasma FSH concentration, and to determine if downregulation of the HPG axis is achieved in male dogs during <b>deslorelin</b> treatment. Recovery of added canine FSH and serial dilutions of urine reported that the immunoradiometric assay measures urinary FSH concentration accurately and with high precision. Plasma FSH concentrations (the mean of two samples, taken 40 ??minutes apart) and the urinary FSH to creatinine ratio were determined before gonadectomy and 140 ??days (median, range 121 ??? 225 ??days) and 206 ??days (median, range 158 ??? 294 ??days) after gonadectomy of 13 bitches and five male dogs, respectively, and in 13 male dogs before and 132 ??days (median, range 117 ??? 174 ??days) after administration of a <b>deslorelin</b> implant. In both bitches and male dogs, the plasma FSH concentration and the urinary FSH to creatinine ratio were significantly higher after gonadectomy, with no overlapping of their ranges. Receiver operating characteristic analysis of the urinary FSH to creatinine ratio revealed a cut-off value of 2. 9 in bitches and 6. 5 in males to verify {{the presence}} or absence of functional gonadal tissue. In male dogs treated with <b>deslorelin,</b> the plasma FSH concentrations and urinary FSH to creatinine ratios were significantly lower after administration of the implant, but their ranges overlapped. We conclude that the urinary FSH to creatinine ratio can be used to verify the neuter status of bitches and male dogs. However, it cannot be used for the assessment of complete downregulation of the HPG axis after administration of a <b>deslorelin</b> implant. The urinary FSH to creatinine ratio is preferable over the plasma FSH concentration because it involves only one sample that can be collected relatively easy and noninvasively...|$|E
40|$|The African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) is {{the second}} most {{endangered}} carnivore in Africa. Although several high-profile endangered species are imperiled due to poor fertility, inadequate genetic diversity, and a reliance on specific niches, the wild dog is threatened by decreasing land space and human hunting practices. Wild dogs are highly fertile with an average litter size of nine at De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre. Wild dog males have 3 million to 900 million sperm per ejaculate and 45 - 75 % progressive motility during the breeding season. Wild dogs released into small nature reserves in South Africa experience increased survival rates due to sizeable litters, abundant prey, and increased hunting success along fence lines. Furthermore, the current demand for captive-bred wild dogs is low due to lack of demand by overseas zoos and the inability of nature reserves to accommodate more dogs. Long-acting GnRH analogues have been used for fertility control in many wildlife species. However, dosing and efficacy differ among species and individual animals. This study assessed the efficacy of the GnRH analogue, <b>deslorelin,</b> on reproductive parameters of male African wild dogs. Seasonal effects on reproduction were also evaluated. Captive male African wild dogs housed at the De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre were administered either a 4. 7 mg <b>deslorelin</b> implant (Suprelorin,® Peptech Animal Health (Pty) Ltd, Sydney, Australia; n = 10), an experimental 9. 4 mg <b>deslorelin</b> injection (n = 11) or a placebo injection (n = 6). Treatment was administered during the non-breeding season (Month 0), and dogs were assessed at Months 3, 5, 6, and 7. Reproductive parameters evaluated before and after treatment included: serum testosterone, testicular and prostatic volume, and semen quality. Serum testosterone was assessed with a previously validated double antibody DSL testosterone radioimmunoassay kit (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Inc, Webster, TX). Testicular volume was calculated from testicular dimensions measured with a calliper and prostatic volume from dimensions obtained by trans-cutaneous ultrasound. Data were analyzed with ANOVA. Although the 4. 7 mg <b>deslorelin</b> implant was safe for use in male wild dogs, there was wide variation in efficacy among dogs. The serum testosterone of implant dogs did not decrease to baseline after treatment and only half the dogs administered an implant became azoospermic post-treatment. The experimental long-acting <b>deslorelin</b> injection was ineffective for contraception of male African wild dogs. All three groups of dogs experienced an improvement in reproductive parameters during the months of February through May, the rainy season in northern South Africa and the period during which female African wild dogs enter oestrus, suggesting that a breeding season not only exists in the female African dog but also in the male. Testis and prostatic volume increased, serum testosterone concentrations and semen quality improved during that time of year. Further studies of <b>deslorelin</b> in male wild dogs are warranted to determine the appropriate dose, pay-out pattern, delivery method, and season of delivery necessary for adequate contraception in this species.
