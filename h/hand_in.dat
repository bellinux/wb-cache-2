He had a <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> founding the NFL Alumni Association, a charitable organization.|$|E
5|$|Apart from American and Soviet {{strategic}} forces, however, camouflage {{continued to}} be applied tactically. For example in the Korean War, American B-29 bombers were switched to night flying with black undersides when Chinese fighters became a significant threat. In the Vietnam War, Vietcong MiG-21 fighters were painted by <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> green ground camouflage patterns, while the USAAF and US Navy both restarted experiments with painted camouflage. In the Soviet–Afghan War, Soviet Mil Mi-24 helicopters were camouflaged in a sand and spinach pattern.|$|E

Almost $60 million compensation has been paid nationwide.|$|R

5|$|De Materia Medica was {{circulated}} as illustrated manuscripts, copied by <b>hand,</b> <b>in</b> Greek, Latin and Arabic throughout the mediaeval period. From {{the sixteenth century}} on, Dioscorides' text was translated into Italian, German, Spanish, and French, and in 1655 into English. It {{formed the basis for}} herbals in these languages by men such as Leonhart Fuchs, Valerius Cordus, Lobelius, Rembert Dodoens, Carolus Clusius, John Gerard and William Turner. Gradually such herbals included more and more direct observations, supplementing and eventually supplanting the classical text.|$|E

5|$|During the Eastern Han, peasants {{could avoid}} {{the month of}} annual conscripted labor by paying a tax in {{commutation}} (gengfu 更賦). This development went <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> hand with {{the increasing use of}} hired labor by the government. In a similar manner, because the Eastern-Han government favored the military recruitment of volunteers, the mandatory military draft for peasants aged twenty-three could be avoided by paying a tax in substitution.|$|E
5|$|During the Renaissance, {{money and}} art went <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> hand. Artists {{depended}} entirely on patrons while the patrons needed money to foster artistic talent. Wealth {{was brought to}} Italy in the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries by expanding trade into Asia and Europe. Silver mining in Tyrol increased the flow of money. Luxuries from the Eastern world, brought home during the Crusades, increased the prosperity of Genoa and Venice.|$|E

5|$|Historically, optical astronomy, {{also called}} visible light astronomy, {{is the oldest}} form of astronomy. Images of {{observations}} were originally drawn by <b>hand.</b> <b>In</b> the late 19th century {{and most of the}} 20th century, images were made using photographic equipment. Modern images are made using digital detectors, particularly using charge-coupled devices (CCDs) and recorded on modern medium. Although visible light itself extends from approximately 4000 Å to 7000 Å (400 nm to 700nm), that same equipment can be used to observe some near-ultraviolet and near-infrared radiation.|$|E
5|$|John Peckham, Archbishop of Canterbury, died in December 1292. On 13 February 1293, Winchelsey {{was elected}} as his successor.

5|$|Like {{those in}} the police force, many in the medical {{profession}} were reluctant {{to abide by the}} new laws. From September 30, gun applicants had to <b>hand</b> <b>in</b> a medical health evaluation (certifying that they were mentally sound enough to bear arms), carried out by a doctor, to gain access to a weapon. The Finnish Medical Association opposed this on the grounds that doctors were already overburdened with work, and Basic Services Minister Paula Risikko suggested that more medical workers could be employed by police departments instead.|$|E
