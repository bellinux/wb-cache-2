5|$|In the 2016 Honolulu mayoral {{elections}} {{the main}} three candidates again took opposing views on rail. Charles Djou, former mayor Peter Carlisle, and incumbent Kirk Caldwell all ran for mayor with the stated goal of finishing rail. However, Republican Djou ran on drastically cutting spending on rail by cutting funding on buying {{cars on the}} rail before its completion, and hiring mainland consultants. Kirk Caldwell also stated that spending on rail should be cut, but instead by shortening the rail to end at Middle Street. Carlisle was the only candidate in full support of funding the rail system and stated that rail <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>too</b> <b>far</b> to be stopped. Kirk Caldwell won the election, and promptly went on to adopt Carlisle's position that rail should be completed.|$|E

In May, Scurlock claimed he had been fired for negative comments about Wayne Coyne's friend Christina Fallin, the daughter of Oklahoma's governor and leader of a band called Pink Pony. Fallin had recently been criticized for cultural appropriation after she wore a Native American headdress in a publicity photo. [...] According to Scurlock, his criticism of Fallin's actions led to conflict with Coyne and his dismissal. In response, Drozd said, [...] "his Lips/Kliph bullshit <b>has</b> <b>gone</b> <b>too</b> <b>far.</b> We parted ways because of the usual band musical differences. The rest has been blown way out." [...] Coyne went even further, calling Scurlock a [...] "pathological liar" [...] and stated that he never meant his defense of Fallin, which included posting a photo of his dog in a feathered headdress, to be offensive {{but that he was}} [...] "very sorry, to anybody that is following my Instagram or my Twitter, if I offended anybody of any religion, any race, any belief system.
