25|$|The {{original}} version of pinochle involves a partial deal of twelve cards to both players in sets of four, leaving a stock of 24 cards. A player can score one meld after each trick won {{of the first}} 12 tricks. Melded cards can even be used to win tricks. After each trick, players draw one card from the stock into their <b>hand</b> <b>starting</b> with the trick-winning player. For the last 12 tricks, melds are taken into each player's hand and are no longer announced by the player who wins the trick. The traditional trick-taking rules apply only for these last 12 tricks.|$|E
