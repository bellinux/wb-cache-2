5|$|A {{century later}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> a legendary figure; William of Tyre {{believed}} that it was Peter who had planted the idea for the crusade in Urban's mind (which was taken as fact by historians until the 19th century). It is commonly believed that Peter's followers consisted of a massive group of untrained and illiterate peasants who did not even have any idea where Jerusalem was, but indeed there were many knights among the peasants, including Walter Sans Avoir, who was lieutenant to Peter and led a separate army.|$|E

5|$|Abovian saw in {{strengthening}} of the friendship of Russian and Armenian peoples a guarantee of the national, political and cultural revival of his native lands. However; when Abovian wrote the novel <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> disillusioned with Tsarist policies in Armenia, particularly {{with the implementation of}} Polozhenie (Statute) in 1836 which greatly reduced the political power of the Armenian Catholicos and the abolishment of the Armenian Oblast in 1840. In the novel, elements of romanticism and realism are interlaced while the narration is supplanted by lyrical retreats.|$|E
5|$|Author Walter Noble Burns visited Earp in September 1926 {{and asked}} him {{questions}} {{with the intent to}} write a book about Earp. Earp declined because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> collaborating with John Flood. Burns visited Tombstone and based on what he learned decided instead to focus his book on Doc Holliday. He pestered Earp for facts, and on March 27 the next year, Earp finally responded to Burns' repeated requests in an 11-page letter outlining the basic facts from Earp's point of view.|$|E
5|$|Canavan captained Tyrone to two All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championships {{titles in}} 1991 and 1992, having {{been on the}} team which lost the 1990 final, again to Kerry. In four years as an Under 21 player, Canavan scored 13–53 (13 goals and 53 points—each goal equals 3 points; 13×3 + 53 = 92 points, see GAA scoring rules) for Tyrone. By {{the time he was}} twenty, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> an {{automatic}} choice in the senior panel.|$|E

5|$|Cody made an {{immediate}} impact for the Crimson Tide defensive line, recording four tackles—one for loss—in a 34–10 rout of the Clemson Tigers. He {{and the rest}} of the defense also held the Tigers, which included running backs James Davis and C. J. Spiller, to zero net rushing yards. With his presence in the middle of the Crimson Tide defensive line, Cody earned himself the nickname of “Mount Cody.” By mid-season <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> considered the No. 1 nose tackle prospect for the 2009 NFL Draft by league scouts.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{had known}} that ruling against the {{government}} might harm his prospects of promotion. By {{the time of the}} case, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> the most senior judge of his district. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit often summoned him to sit with that court to hear appeals, a task he found stimulating. In 1917, he lobbied for promotion to the Second Circuit, but the unpopularity of his Masses decision and his reputation as a liberal stood against him. He was passed over in favor of Martin T. Manton.|$|E
5|$|Hastings {{represented}} Mrs Russell in {{the initial}} trial at the High Court and lost; the decision was appealed to the Court of Appeal, where he again lost. The case was then sent to the House of Lords, who {{by a majority of}} three to two (with Lord Birkenhead giving the leading judgment) overturned the previous judgments and said that Mr Russell's evidence as to the legitimacy of his son was inadmissible. Hastings did not represent Mrs Russell in the House of Lords case, however, because by this point <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> Attorney General.|$|E

In 1911, Flanders married Hartness' daughter, Helen. Shortly afterwards, Hartness hired Flanders as a manager of the department at J that built the Fay automatic lathe. Flanders redesigned that lathe to achieve higher productivity and accuracy. He became a director in 1912 and president of the company in 1933 after Hartness retired.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Northumberland's {{relations}} with the other great northern family, the Nevilles, were friendly. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> connected to the Beaufort-Nevilles through his marriage with Eleanor Neville, and in 1426 he married his sister Elizabeth to the young Ralph Neville, 2nd Earl of Westmorland. In the early 1440s, Northumberland was involved in other disputes. A conflict over land with the Archbishop of York escalated into open violence. The king intervened on the archbishop's side, though Northumberland remained in favour at court. Nevertheless, he spent less time involved in central affairs at Westminster in the later 1440s.|$|E
5|$|Mina fell in {{love with}} actor Corrado Pani in 1962. Their {{relationship}} shocked Italian audiences as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> married although separated from his wife. Their son, , was born on 18 April 1963. Due to Mina's refusal to hide the relationship, the singer was banned from performing on public Italian television or radio channels. As her record sales were unaffected and audiences demanded to see Mina on the air, RAI was forced to end the ban and let Mina return to television on 10 January 1964. Within a year, her affair with Corrado ended.|$|E

5|$|Robert Kurrle (February 2, 1890 – October 27, 1932), {{also known}} as Robert B. Kurrle, was an American cinematographer during the silent and early talking film eras. Prior to {{entering}} the film industry, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> experimenting with aerial photography. Considered a very prominent cinematographer, even his early work received notice and praise from both critics and other industry professionals. The advent of sound film did not abate his continued rise, and he became the top director of photography at Warner Brothers by 1932.|$|E

Declining to support the straggler, La Meillerie ran on towards France while Mars took possession of Rhin, and the surviving ships found safe ports along the Biscay coast.|$|E
5|$|The estate {{started to}} {{deteriorate}} {{after it was}} inherited by the Governor's illegitimate son George Ferguson, known as the Admiral because of his naval career. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> heavily in debt when he became the fifth laird in 1821, but he still enjoyed a lavish lifestyle and undertook much extravagant construction on the estate, including the erection of follies. To cover his substantial gambling debts, he began to sell parcels of estate land, and upon inheriting Pitfour he began selling furniture, books, farm equipment and other items, realising more than £9,000.|$|E

Container ships were considered too large for the traditional British {{shipping line}}s, including Cunard and their subsidiaries to operate, so it would be necessary to form partnerships.|$|E
5|$|B'alam Nehn (often {{referred}} to as Waterlily Jaguar) was the first king to actually record his position in the dynastic succession, declaring that he was seventh in line from K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo'. Stela15 records that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> ruling Copán by AD504. B'alam Nehn is the only king of Copán to be mentioned in a hieroglyphic text from outside of the southeastern Maya region. His name appears in a text on Stela16 from Caracol, a site in Belize. The stela dates to AD534, but the text is not well understood. B'alam Nehn undertook major construction projects in the Acropolis, building over an early palace {{with a number of}} important structures.|$|E
5|$|Bennett grew up {{listening}} to Al Jolson, Eddie Cantor, Judy Garland, and Bing Crosby as well as jazz artists such as Louis Armstrong, Jack Teagarden, and Joe Venuti. His Uncle Dick was a tap dancer in vaudeville, giving him an early window into show business, and his Uncle Frank was the Queens borough library commissioner. By age 10 <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>already</b> singing, and performed {{at the opening of the}} Triborough Bridge, standing next to Mayor Fiorello La Guardia who patted him on the head. Drawing was another early passion of his; he became known as the class caricaturist at P.S. 141 and anticipated a career in commercial art. He began singing for money at age 13, performing as a singing waiter in several Italian restaurants around his native Queens.|$|E
