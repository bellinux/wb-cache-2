25|$|The fight {{ranks as}} one of the {{shortest}} heavyweight title bouts in history. Many in the small crowd had not even settled in their seats when the fight was stopped. The official time of the stoppage was announced as 1:00 into the first round, which was wrong. Liston went down at 1:44, <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 1:56, and Walcott stopped the fight at 2:12.|$|E
25|$|The opening {{match was}} between Rey Mysterio and Montel Vontavious Porter for MVP's WWE United States Championship. Mysterio used his quickness and aerial {{techniques}} {{to be on}} the top. Mysterio wrestled a good match by sending MVP who crashed on the arena floor and then he executed a hurricanrana on MVP. Mysterio got into the ring to break the referee's 10 count and MVP also <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 8 count but he simply walked out instead of coming back into the ring after he climbed on the ring apron. MVP was counted out and thus he retained the title because a title does not change hands by countout. After the match, Mysterio threw MVP back into the ring and executed the 619 on MVP.|$|E

25|$|When {{the team}} flew to Adelaide they were {{met at the}} airport by Test Selector Sir Donald Bradman, who had <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 4 {{o'clock in the morning}} to meet their {{overnight}} flight, and Bill Jeanes, the secretary of the South Australian Cricket Association who happily arranged social introductions, golf and other entertainments during their stay. South Australia were stronger than Western Australia, but rarely won the Sheffield Shield and fielded no Test players, though batsman Graeme Hole and wicket-keeper Gil Langley would later play for Australia. Len Hutton had by now recovered from his finger damaged in Colombo and was reunited with his old opening partner Cyril Washbrook. Washbrook had been an original choice for the team who had declined to tour before changing his mind and being flown out to join the party. Brown won the toss again and this time put the opposition in at the Adelaide Oval on what was by tradition a flat, lifeless wicket so that he could fully test his bowlers. Allen MacLean was out for 2, {{but the rest of the}} team batted solidly and Ron Hamence making 114 as Doug Wright (4/103) worked his way expensively through the batting and Brown took 3/55 in the absence of Alec Bedser. Bob Berry was put on and took 0/33 off 12 overs, which made Brown doubt his ability, leading him to be underused for the rest of the tour. When it was their return to bat the MCC bettered the home score by one run before Brown declared on 351/9 with nearly all the runs coming from Hutton (126) and Reg Simpson (119) adding 170 for the second wicket, Godfrey Evans reaching 38 and nobody else making 20. The game looked doom to a draw, but the South Australia captain Ridings declared on 185/3 after Dansie had made 64 to give the MCC a sporting chance of making 185 runs in 135 minutes. Hutton was out driving for 1, but Washbrook (63) and Simpson (69) rattled up 131 in just over an hour before Evans hit six successive balls to the boundary to give his team an undeserved 7 wicket win.|$|E
2500|$|He {{wrote in}} May 1912 that Wittgenstein {{had just begun}} to study the history of philosophy: [...] "He expresses the most naive {{surprise}} that all the philosophers he once worshipped in ignorance are after all stupid and dishonest and make disgusting mistakes!" [...] The last time they saw each other was on 8 October 1913 at Lordswood House in Birmingham, then residence of the Pinsent family: [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> 6.15 to see Ludwig off. He had to go very early – back to Cambridge – as he has lots to do there. I saw him off from the house in a taxi at 7.0 – to catch a 7.30 am train from New St Station. It was sad parting from him." [...] Wittgenstein left to live in Norway.|$|E
2500|$|Max Tegmark {{also reports}} {{the result of}} a [...] "highly unscientific" [...] poll taken at a 1997 quantum {{mechanics}} workshop. According to Tegmark, [...] "The many worlds interpretation (MWI) scored second, comfortably ahead of the consistent histories and Bohminterpretations." [...] Such polls have been taken at other conferences, for example, in response to Sean Carroll's observation, [...] "As crazy as it sounds, most working physicists buy into the many-worlds theory" [...] Michael Nielsen counters: [...] "at a quantum computing conference at Cambridge in 1998, a many-worlder surveyed the audience of approximately 200 people... Many-worlds did just fine, garnering support on a level comparable to, but somewhat below, Copenhagen and decoherence." [...] However, Nielsen notes that it seemed most attendees found it to be a waste of time: Asher Peres [...] "got a huge and sustained round of applause… when he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the end of the polling and asked 'And who here believes the laws of physics are decided by a democratic vote?'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Dempsey {{was losing}} the fight on points {{when in the}} seventh round he knocked Tunney down with a left hook to the chin then landed several more punches. A new rule instituted {{at the time of}} the fight {{mandated}} that when a fighter knocked down an opponent, he must immediately go to a neutral corner. [...] Dempsey, however, refused to immediately move to the neutral corner when instructed by the referee. The referee had to escort Dempsey to the neutral corner, which bought Tunney at least an extra five seconds to recover. [...] Even though the official timekeeper clocked 14 seconds Tunney was down, Tunney <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the referee's count of 9. [...] Dempsey then attempted to finish Tunney off before the end of the round, but failed to do so. [...] Tunney dropped Dempsey for a count of one in round eight and won the final two rounds of the fight, retaining the title of World Heavyweight Champion on a unanimous decision. Ironically, the neutral corner rule was requested during negotiations by members of the Dempsey camp. Another discrepancy was, when Tunney knocked Dempsey down, the timekeeper started the count immediately, not waiting for Tunney to move to a neutral corner. Because of the controversial nature of the fight due to the neutral corner rule and conflicting counts, the Dempsey-Tunney rematch remains known as [...] "The Long Count Fight".|$|E
2500|$|Though Chamberlain {{was always}} very {{supportive}} of German imperialism, he had nothing but scorn for British imperialism, viewing Britain as the world's biggest bully, a view that he expressed more and more vehemently as the 1890s went on. In 1895, Chamberlain wrote to his aunt about the Hamidian massacres in the Ottoman Empire during 1894–96:The Armenian insurrection [...] with the inevitable retaliation of massacres and persecution (of course enormously exaggerated by those greatest liars in creation, backed by their worthy friends the English journalists) was all <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the precise moment when English politics required a [...] "diversion". In 1896, Chamberlain wrote to his aunt:The English press is the most insufferably arrogant, generally ignorant, the most passionately one-sided and narrow-minded in its judgments that I know; it is the universal bully, always laying down the law for everybody, always speaking {{as if it were}} umpire of the universe, always abusing everybody all round and putting party spirit in all its judgments, envenoming thus the most peaceful discussions. It is this and this only which has made England hated all the world over. During the whole year 1895, I never opened an English newspaper without finding War predicated or threatened…No other nation in the world has wanted war or done anything but pray for peace-England alone, the world's bully, has been stirring it up on all sides. During the 1890s, Chamberlain was an outspoken critic of British policy in South Africa, writing to his uncle in 1898: We are the heathen nation and race par excellence. War, conquest, commerce, money and above all an eternal readiness to knock every man down who stands in our way. And the only thing thoroughly distasteful to me in England and Englishmen generally, and English politics in particular, is this eternal coquetting with a religion to which every one of their feelings and opinions and acts is in direct contradiction. At the time of the Boer War, Chamberlain supported the Boers against the British, though not publicly and he expressed much regret that two white peoples should be killing each other {{at a time when he}} believed that white supremacy around the world was being threatened by the alleged [...] "Yellow Peril". In July 1900, Chamberlain wrote to his aunt: One thing I can clearly see, that is that it is criminal for Englishmen and Dutchmen to go on murdering each other for all sorts of sophisticated reasons, while the Great Yellow Danger overshadows us white men and threatens destruction...The fact that a tiny nation of peasants absolutely untrained in the conduct of war, has been able to keep the whole united empire at bay for months, and has only been overcome-and has it been overcome?-by sending out an army superior in number to the whole population including women and children, has lowered respect for England beyond anything you can imagine on your side of the water, and will certainly not remain lost on the minds of those countless millions who have hitherto been subdued by our prestige only. Chamberlain seized upon the fact that some of the Randlords were Jewish to argue in his letters to Cosima Wagner that the war was a case of Anglo-Jewish aggression against the Germanic Afrikaners. Wagner wrote back to Chamberlain: [...] "This extermination of one of the most excellent Germanic races is so horrible that I know of nothing I have experienced which is comparable to it".|$|E
