60|$|When December {{was well}} along, Grey Beaver {{went on a}} journey up the Mackenzie. Mit-sah and Kloo-kooch went with him. One sled he drove himself, drawn by dogs he had traded for or borrowed. A second and smaller sled was driven by Mit-sah, and to this was {{harnessed}} a team of puppies. It {{was more of a}} toy affair than anything else, yet it was the delight of Mit-sah, who felt that he was beginning to do a man's work in the world. Also, he was learning to <b>drive</b> <b>dogs</b> and to train dogs; while the puppies themselves were being broken in to the harness. Furthermore, the sled was of some service, for it carried nearly two hundred pounds of outfit and food.|$|E
6000|$|Colonel Trethaway {{seemed to}} have thrown twenty years off his erect shoulders, and the {{discrepancy}} in the match which Frona had felt vanished {{as she looked at}} him. [...] "He has lived the years well," [...] she thought, and prompted mysteriously, almost with vague apprehension she turned her eyes to Corliss. But if the groom had thrown off twenty years, Vance was not a whit behind. Since their last meeting he had sacrificed his brown moustache to the frost, and his smooth face, smitten with health and vigor, looked uncommonly boyish; and yet, withal, the naked upper lip advertised a stiffness and resolution hitherto concealed. Furthermore, his features portrayed a growth, and his eyes, which had been softly firm, were now firm with the added harshness or hardness which is bred of coping with things and coping quickly,--the stamp of executiveness which is pressed upon men who do, and upon all men who do, whether they <b>drive</b> <b>dogs,</b> buck the sea, or dictate the policies of empires.|$|E

60|$|Dan {{had gone}} in for {{building}} model boats; but after he had filled the schoolroom with chips, which he expected Una to clear away, they turned him out of doors and he took all his tools {{up the hill to}} Mr Springett's yard, where he knew he could make as much mess as he chose. Old Mr Springett was a builder, contractor, and sanitary engineer, and his yard, which opened off the village street, was always full of interesting things. At one end of it was a long loft, reached by a ladder, where he kept his iron-bound scaffold-planks, tins of paints, pulleys, and odds and ends he had found in old houses. He would sit here by the hour watching his carts as they loaded or unloaded in the yard below, while Dan gouged and grunted at the carpenter's bench near the loft window. Mr Springett and Dan had always been particular friends, for Mr Springett was so old he could remember when railways were being made in the southern counties of England, and people were allowed to <b>drive</b> <b>dogs</b> in carts.|$|E

Then she says, 'I understand, Charley. I will give you seven hundred and fifty dollars each month.' It is a good price, and I go to work for her. I buy for her dogs and sled. We travel up Klondike, up Bonanza and Eldorado, over to Indian River, to Sulphur Creek, to Dominion, back across divide to Gold Bottom and to Too Much Gold, and back to Dawson. All the time she look for something, I do not know what. I am puzzled. 'What thing you look for?' I ask. She laugh. 'You look for gold?' I ask. She laugh. Then she says, 'That is none of your business, Charley.' And after that I never ask any more.|$|E
40|$|The data {{taken at}} the {{electronic}} reception of logs are tasked with mistaken values and do not correspond to the real shape of a stem. The aim of the data filtration is to remove the incorrect data and replace them by the ones, closer to the real values. The goal of presented work was to analyse the effect of different filtration methods on original data and to recommend the methods, which results correspond to the real shape of the logs with their defects on a surface as close as possible. Methods of filtration are based on simple mathematical and statistical procedures, which are subsequently variously combined, because the simplest comparative methods did not fulfil the expectations. More than 50 methods were combined and analyzed. Approximately 15 of them were selected and tested. The methods were applied to data scanned on ca 150 logs randomly selected from thousands of files in the sawmill log yard. The filtration effects of different methods were visually assessed. The most applicable three methods were selected {{and they will be}} tested practically at sawmill in the next step of research. These three methods are described in following paper. Results refer, that all proposed methods correspond to necessities for log dimensions determination. It is not possible to define the best method generally. Different properties of these methods make them suitable for calculation of log dimensions if different type of use is requested. It means for mid diameter determination necessary for volume calculation by using Huber method; for section dia­me­ter determination for volume calculation by using section method; for top diameter determination necessary for sorting; for filtration of <b>drive</b> <b>dogs</b> of the conveyor passing through the measuring equipment...|$|E

Rasmussen spent his early years in Greenland among the Kalaallit (Inuit) where he learned from an early age to speak the language (Kalaallisut), hunt, <b>drive</b> <b>dog</b> sleds and live in harsh Arctic conditions. [...] "My playmates were native Greenlanders; from the earliest boyhood I played and worked with the hunters, so even the hardships of the most strenuous sledge-trips became pleasant routine for me." [...] He was later educated in Lynge, North Zealand, Denmark. Between 1898 and 1900 he pursued an unsuccessful career as an actor and opera singer.|$|R

Then, one evening, we came to a creek. The stream had kept the channel open here and there, and I thought the ice thin, but it was open, rocky country round about, and I saw a clump of pines in the distance where we could camp. It got dark as we followed the creek and clouds drifted over the moon, but I wanted to find shelter and pushed on. Once or twice the ice cracked ominously, but it held until we came to a spot where the stream got narrower between high, rocky banks.|$|R
