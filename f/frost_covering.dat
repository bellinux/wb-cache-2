50|$|The Blue Mountains has a {{reputation}} for snow in winter. However, despite the cool temperatures, there are only around five snowy days per year in the upper mountains area. It is extremely rare to see snow below Lawson. It is not unusual to see white blankets of <b>frost</b> <b>covering</b> the ground in the early morning hours. In the evening, thick coverings of ice can form on car windscreens.|$|E
5000|$|V. salicifolia prefer {{sites in}} good light, with well-drained soil. More {{moisture}} in soil can help quickly succumb. But they are considerable drought tolerance once established. [...] Forest tolerant tested shown that H. salicifolia is tolerant to freezing. In the test, 50% damage to leaves was reported at -0.6Â°C.Technically, H. salicifolia has closed vegetative buds, which could give protection from <b>frost</b> by <b>covering</b> vulnerable apex, only open when fully grown. However, Dallimore (1913) pointed that most Hebe is only specialized in habitats similar to New Zealand. Hebe {{may not be}} hardy except when grown in the southern and western countries of England, the west of Scotland, Ireland and various islands off {{the west coast of}} Britain.|$|R
40|$|A {{model for}} {{seasonal}} taransport of volatiles based on Trafton (1984) is coupled to considerations of methane photochemistry to infer albedo patterns on Triton's surface {{at the time}} of the Voyager encounter. The relatively large southern subsolar latitude at present is predicted to cause the deposition of an extensive fresh <b>frost</b> layer <b>covering</b> approximately the northern half of the planet. Sublimation of Triton's south polar ice has been occurring since 1930, but has been preferentially occurring near the pole. The sublimation of ices in this region may be concentrating dark organic matter on the surface of the ice or exposing layers of this material which have built up in the ice over many seasonal cycles. The south polar cap may be distinctly darker near the pole than around the equatorward edge...|$|R
40|$|A {{dimensionless}} correlation {{has been}} proposed for water frost porosity expressing its dependence on frost surface temperature and Reynolds number for laminar forced flow over a flat surface. The correlation is presented {{in terms of a}} dimensionless frost surface temperature scaled with the cold plate temperature, and the freezing temperature. The flow Reynolds number is scaled with reference to the critical Reynolds number for laminar-turbulent transition. The proposed correlation agrees satisfactorily with the simultaneous measurements of frost density and <b>frost</b> surface temperature <b>covering</b> a range of plate temperature, ambient air velocity, humidity, and temperature. It is revealed that the frost porosity depends primarily on the frost surface and the plate temperatures and the flow Reynolds number, and is only weakly dependent on the relative humidity. The results also point out the general character of frost porosity displaying a decrease with an increase in flow Reynolds number...|$|R

5000|$|Upon {{opening the}} sealed bag it was {{revealed}} that there was only one glove inside and that the [...] "third glove" [...] was actually the inner lining of the second glove, which had come out and had been mistaken for a glove by rescue workers due to the <b>frost</b> <b>covering</b> it. This error having been corrected and it now being a matter of record that only two gloves were found, the Second Court of Appeals again declared unfounded the charges against Rosario apparently with the intention of dismissing the case. Gonzalo Bellido, the attorney of the accused, assured that the indications used by the district attorney are insufficient to accuse his client of second degree murder. Nevertheless, the appeals court clarified that the district attorney's investigation had not yet finished. Upon hearing this, the mother of the accused, one Maria del Carmen Lopez, indicated she would resort to the Supreme Court to insist that the investigation be closed.|$|E
50|$|On the 18th the {{regiment}} received orders to march for the front. General Whittaker {{was at the}} head of the column. The command had marched five miles in the direction of Ringgold, when it came suddenly upon the rebel pickets, who fired upon the General and staff, but with no result, except to hasten forward our skirmishers. A detail was at once sent forward and skirmished with the enemy till dark. The Eighty-Fourth was formed in line of battle on the left of the Ringgold road, near a small stream called Pea Vine, or Little Chickamauga. The rebel batteries threw several shells over and around them, but did no damage, the command being protected by a slight elevation in front. After dark {{the regiment}} moved one hundred yards in advance, where the men lay down in line of battle, on their arms, for the night. Next morning they fell back to McAfee church, distant one mile, where the men prepared breakfast. Two companies were thrown forward as skirmishers, and were soon reinforced by a third; all under command of Major Neff. Three scouts being called for to act as videttes, E. D. Baugh, C. N. Taylor and John Wall, of Company E, tendered their service, and started for the front. They had hardly disappeared from view when the sharp crack of the rebel rifles was heard, answered at once by the fire of the scouts. Our skirmishers at once advanced, became sharply engaged with those of the enemy, and drove them back upon his main line. The reserve of the regiment then moved to the support of the skirmishers. The Eighty-Fourth was formed on the right of the Ringgold road behind a fence. A brisk fight ensued, lasting an hour and a half, the regiment losing twenty-two killed, wounded and missing. No support arriving, the command was forced back. They had been fighting a brigade of the rebel General Longstreet's command. In fact, owing to the heavy woods and thick underbrush obstructing the vision, and the enemy's familiarity with the country, the regiment was nearly surrounded before they were aware of their situation. The Fortieth Ohio and the One Hundred and Fifteenth Illinois, however, covered their flanks and rear, and saved them from being captured. They bivouacked that night near the McAfee church. The weather was extremely cold, a heavy <b>frost</b> <b>covering</b> the surface of the earth. Many of the men were compelled to build fires to keep from freezing, having no blankets. Drawing rations, and eating supper, the men lay down, little dreaming of the dreadful shock of arms on the battle-field of Chickamauga, which followed on the morrow.|$|E
40|$|The Galileo Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer {{was used}} to {{investigate}} the distribution and properties of sulfur dioxide {{over the surface of}} and qualitative results for the anti-Jove hemisphere are presented here. S 02, existing as a frost, is found almost everywhere, but with spatially variable concentration. The exceptions are volcanic hot spots, where high surface temperatures promote rapid vaporization and can produce areas. The pervasive <b>frost,</b> if fully <b>covering</b> the cold surface, has characteristic grain sizes of 30 to 100 or greater. Regions of greater dioxide concentrations are found. The equatorial Regio area exhibits extensive snowfields with large particles (250 to 500 diameter, or greater) beneath smaller particles. A weak feature at 3. 15 is observed and perhaps due to hydroxides, hydrates, or water. A broad absorption in the 1 region, which could be caused by iron-containing minerals, shows a concentration in southern polar region, with an absence in the Pele plume depositio [...] ...|$|R
40|$|New {{spectrophotometry}} from 1. 5 to 2. 5 microns {{is reported}} for the Uranian satellites Titania, Oberon, and Umbriel. A spectrum of the rings of Uranus from 2. 0 to 2. 4 microns is also reported. No evidence is found for <b>frost</b> <b>covering</b> {{the surface of the}} ring material, consistent with the low albedo of the rings previously reported by Nicholson and Jones (1980). The surfaces of the satellites are found to be covered by dirty water frost. Assuming albedos of the frost and gray components covering the Uranian satellites to be the same as the light and dark faces of Iapetus, radii are derived that are roughly twice those inferred from the assumption of a visual albedo of 0. 5...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{have built}} a new 3 D Global Climate Model (GCM) to {{simulate}} Pluto as observed by New Horizons in 2015. All key processes are parametrized {{on the basis of}} theoretical equations, including atmospheric dynamics and transport, turbulence, radiative transfer, molecular conduction, as well as phases changes for N 2, CH 2 and CO. Pluto's climate and ice cycles are found to be very sensitive to model parameters and initial states. Nevertheless, a reference simulation is designed by running a fast, reduced version of the GCM with simplified atmospheric transport for 40, 000 Earth years to initialize the surface ice distribution and sub-surface temperatures, from which a 28 -Earth-year full GCM simulation is performed. Assuming a topographic depression in a Sputnik-planum (SP) -like crater on the anti-Charon hemisphere, a realistic Pluto is obtained, with most N 2 and CO ices accumulated in the crater, methane <b>frost</b> <b>covering</b> both hemispheres except for the equatorial regions, and a surface pressure near 1. 1 Pa in 2015 with an increase between 1988 and 2015, as reported from stellar occultations. Temperature profiles are in qualitative agreement with the observations. In particular, a cold atmospheric layer is obtained in the lowest kilometers above Sputnik Planum, as observed by New Horizons's REX experiment. It is shown to result from the combined effect of the topo-graphic depression and N 2 daytime sublimation. In the reference simulation with surface N 2 ice exclusively present in Sputnik Planum, the global circulation is only forced by radiative heating gradients and remains relatively weak. Surface winds are locally induced by topography slopes and by N 2 condensation and sublimation around Sputnik Planum. However, the circulation can be more intense depending on the exact distribution of surface N 2 frost. This is illustrated in an alternative simulation with N 2 condensing in the South Polar regions and N 2 <b>frost</b> <b>covering</b> latitudes between 35 â¢ N and 48 â¢ N. A global condensation flow is then created, inducing strong surface winds everywhere, a prograde jet in the southern high latitudes, and an equatorial superrotation likely forced by barotropic instabilities in the southern jet. Using realistic parameters, the GCM predict atmospheric concentrations of CO and CH 4 in good agreement with the observations. N 2 and CO do not condense in the atmosphere, but CH 4 ice clouds can form during daytime at low altitude near the regions covered by N 2 ice (assuming that nucleation is efficient enough). This global climate model can be used to study many aspects of the Pluto environment. For instance, organic hazes are included in the GCM and analysed in a companion paper (Bertrand and Forget, Icarus, this issue) ...|$|E
