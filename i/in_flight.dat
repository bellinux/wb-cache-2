5|$|It has {{parallel}} wing bars on {{the half}} of the wings connected near the white patch giving it a distinctive appearance <b>in</b> <b>flight.</b> The black central rectrices and typical white lateral rectrices are also noticeable <b>in</b> <b>flight.</b> The iris is usually a light green-yellow or a yellow, {{but there have been}} instances of an orange color. The bill is black with a brownish black appearance at the base. The juvenile appearance is marked by its streaks on its back, distinguished spots and streaks on its chest, and a gray or grayish-green iris.|$|E

5|$|Longacre's obverse of {{an eagle}} <b>in</b> <b>flight</b> {{is based on}} that of the Gobrecht dollar, struck in small {{quantities}} from 1836 to 1839. Although Gobrecht's model is not known with certainty, some sources state that the bird <b>in</b> <b>flight</b> was based on Peter the eagle, a tame bird fed by Mint workers in the early 1830s until it {{was caught up in}} machinery and killed.

5|$|The fulvous {{whistling}} duck or fulvous tree duck (Dendrocygna bicolor) is a whistling duck that breeds {{across the}} world's tropical regions in much of Mexico and South America, the West Indies, the southern US, sub-Saharan Africa and the Indian subcontinent. It has mainly reddish brown plumage, long legs and a long grey bill, and shows a distinctive white band across its black tail <b>in</b> <b>flight.</b> Like other members of its ancient lineage, it has a whistling call which is given <b>in</b> <b>flight</b> or on the ground. The preferred habitat is shallow lakes, paddy fields or other wetlands with plentiful vegetation.|$|E

5|$|The {{king vulture}} soars for hours effortlessly, only {{flapping}} its wings infrequently. While <b>in</b> <b>flight,</b> its wings are held flat with slightly raised tips, {{and from a}} distance the vulture can appear to be headless while <b>in</b> <b>flight.</b> Its wing beats are deep and strong. Birds have been observed engaging in tandem flight on two occasions in Venezuela by naturalist Marsha Schlee, who has proposed {{it could be a}} part of courtship behaviour.|$|E

5|$|A {{distinctive}} bird, the blue-faced honeyeater differs in coloration {{from the}} duller-plumaged friarbirds, miners and wattlebirds, {{and it is}} {{much larger than the}} similarly coloured Melithreptus honeyeaters. Subspecies albipennis with its white wing patch has been likened to a khaki-backed butcherbird <b>in</b> <b>flight.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{technique}} was developed that combined the front projection effect with specially designed zoom lenses. The illusion of movement {{was created by}} zooming in on Reeve while making the front projected image appear to recede. For scenes where Superman interacts with other people or objects while <b>in</b> <b>flight,</b> Reeve and actors were put {{in a variety of}} rigging equipment with careful lighting and photography. This also {{led to the creation of}} the Zoptic system.|$|E
5|$|As a result, {{the distal}} {{arm of the}} third {{axillary}} sclerite rotates upwards and inwards, so that finally its position is completely reversed. The anal veins are articulated with this sclerite {{in such a way}} that when it moves they are carried with it and become flexed over the back of the insect. Activity of the same muscle <b>in</b> <b>flight</b> affects the power output of the wing and so it is also important <b>in</b> <b>flight</b> control. In orthopteroid insects, the elasticity of the cuticle causes the vannal area of the wing to fold along the veins. Consequently, energy is expended in unfolding this region when the wings are moved to the flight position. In general, wing extension probably results from the contraction of muscles attached to the basalar sclerite or, in some insects, to the subalar sclerite.|$|E

5|$|Dragonflies (suborder Anisoptera) are heavy-bodied, strong-flying {{insects that}} hold their wings {{horizontally}} both <b>in</b> <b>flight</b> and at rest. By contrast, damselflies (suborder Zygoptera) have slender bodies and fly more weakly; most species fold their wings over the abdomen when stationary, {{and the eyes}} are well separated {{on the sides of}} the head.|$|E

50|$|In modern {{aerobatic}}s, an Immelmann turn (also {{known as}} a roll-off-the-top, or simply an Immelmann) is an aerobatic maneuver. Essentially, the aerobatic Immelmann comprises an ascending half-loop followed by a half-roll, resulting <b>in</b> level <b>flight</b> <b>in</b> the exact opposite direction at a higher altitude. It is {{the exact opposite of}} a Split S, which involves a half-roll followed by a half-loop, resulting <b>in</b> level <b>flight</b> <b>in</b> the exact opposite direction at a lower altitude.|$|R
