40|$|The role of spiders in {{regulating}} phytophagous pest populations {{is very difficult}} to investigate in open fields. In 2001 we began to observe the activity of these predators upon <b>grapevine</b> <b>moth,</b> and we continued this study in 2006 - 2007 with research to quantify their impact on the key pest of vineyards in Southern Italy, i. e. Lobesia botrana (Denis & Schiffermüller) (Lepidoptera Tortricidae). The research was realized in an experimental screenhouse vineyard completely covered by one single piece of insect-proof net. The screenhouse was subdivided into two isolated equal parts by a vertical net. The experiment consisted in collecting the spiders from each vine of one half of the vineyard and transferring them into the second half, then evaluating the variation of population density both of L. botrana and spiders over the seasons. In order to evaluate the spider population density, we randomly selected three plots in each half vineyard; each plot consisting of 10 cv Italia vines. Spiders were collected weekly from each vine of the plot using an entomological umbrella. From bloom to harvest, <b>grapevine</b> <b>moth</b> infestation was assessed by collecting one inflorescence or one cluster per vine and counting the numbers of infested berries and live larvae. <b>Grapevine</b> <b>moth</b> adults were collected weekly using sex pheromone traps and then counted. The regular transfer of spiders from one half of the vineyard to the other caused a noticeable variation in their density. The total number of spiders in the enriched vineyard was about double that in the depleted vineyard in 2006, and more than four times the number in 2007. As a consequence of spider enrichment in the release plot, the <b>grapevine</b> <b>moth</b> adults diminished, reaching the lowest density in the second year of study, when the number of adults trapped was less than one half of the number trapped in the plot where spiders were removed. The usefulness of spider activity in limiting L. botrana adults was not followed by a similar effect on phytophagous larvae, mainly because predators have poor possibilities of reaching the endophytic larvae of L. botrana carpophagous generations...|$|R

40|$|Climate {{change may}} impact {{patterns}} of plant diseases and arthropod development in more complex ways than expected. In fact, whereas both crops and crop pathogens and pests {{are affected by}} climatic variables, they might be influenced by different combinations of driving factors, and they might respond to their change at different rates. In order to separate these effects, we need to improve {{our understanding of the}} host-pest/pathogen system, and consider their interaction. The aim {{of this study was to}} refine current assessments of climate change impacts on pest and disease pressure on grapevines by considering pest/pathogen-host interactions. This research (i) combined detailed phenological models of grapevine with phenological models of one of its key insect pests (<b>European</b> <b>grapevine</b> <b>moth)</b> and one of its key pathogens (powdery mildew), (ii) applied the models to climate change scenarios for a selected study area in the eastern Italian Alps, and (iii) considered potential changes in their interactions. These simulations suggest that in the warmer, more profitable viticultural areas of the study region increasing temperature might have a detrimental impact on crop yield due to increased asynchrony between the larvae-resistant growth stages of grapevine and larvae of the <b>European</b> <b>grapevine</b> <b>moth.</b> On the other hand, the increase in pest pressure due to the increased number of generations might not be as severe as expected on the basis of the pest model only, due to the advance in harvest dates limiting damages from late-season generations.

40|$|Mating {{disruption}} is {{a sustainable}} method {{for the control}} of insect pests, involving the release of synthetic sex pheromones that disrupt the olfactory localization of females by males. However, the development and refinement of this strategy is hampered because current instruments lack the sensitivity to detect volatile organic chemicals in the field, and portable electroantennograms produce non-comparable relative units and distorted results {{in the presence of}} plant volatiles. To address the demand for more sensitive instruments that are suitable for the rapid in situ detection of airborne pheromones, we have developed a portable, automated needle trap device connected to a gas chromatograph, mass spectrometer, and electroantennographic detector (NTD-GC-MS/EAD) suitable for field applications. We tested the instrument by measuring the concentration of the sex pheromone (E,Z) - 7, 9 -dodecadienyl acetate, which is used to disrupt the mating of the <b>European</b> <b>grapevine</b> <b>moth</b> L obesia botrana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae).

40|$|The <b>grapevine</b> <b>moth,</b> Lobesia botrana, is a {{destructive}} pest of grapevine. Deregulation {{of many of}} the insecticides used in the control of this pest along with public demand of residue-free products, have augmented the interest for innovative tools in pest management. Behaviour-modifying semiochemicals can be used for environmentally safe insect management and are a promising alternative to insecticides. The aim of this thesis was (1) to reinvestigate the female sex pheromone and (2) to identify behaviourally active host plant compounds. In the flight tunnel, L. botrana females were attracted to green grapes and shoots of grapevine Vitis vinifera. Females were also attracted to headspace collections from grape, showing that they rely on olfactory cues during host search. Analysis of the volatiles of V. vinifera headspace disclosed high variation in the odour profiles both between varieties of the same species and different phenological stages of the same variety. A synthetic mimic of grape volatiles, consisting of the compounds eliciting the strongest antennal responses, was as attractive as the host-plant to mated L. botrana females in the wind tunnel. The essence of this attractant was boiled down to a blend of three ubiquitous terpenes. The results show that attraction to grape is encoded by a ratio-specific blend of at least three compounds. <b>Grapevine</b> <b>moth</b> is a generalist herbivore. Females were attracted also to its native host, Daphne gnidium. The compounds from D. gnidium which elicited antennal activity attracted more females than the corresponding blend of V. vinifera compounds. In addition, more females were attracted to the compounds co-occurring in Daphne and Vitis, than to the compounds which occurred in Vitis only. Attraction to widely occuring plant volatiles may thus in part account for a generalist feeding habit. Analysis of female sex pheromone glands showed the presence of three previously unidentified compounds. Two of these compounds significantly enhanced the male response to the main pheromone compound. Behavioural studies showed that mating disruption dispensers, applied in the vineyard the previous season emitted pheromone and attracted L. botrana males. This suggests that aged dispensers contribute to the mating disruption effect. An additional study concerned the disorientation technique, a new pheromone-based insect control method. This technique uses a reduced pheromone application rate and its efficacy against <b>grapevine</b> <b>moth</b> was comparable to mating disruption...|$|R
