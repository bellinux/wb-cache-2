He {{said of the}} direction for Ray Ray in an interview for Rolling Stone, [...] "You only get to make a first statement one time, and I had definite ideas of how I wanted it to sound. Ray Ray represents a more fun side of what I do. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{a good time with}} it."

Draper {{was impressed by the}} recording and contemplated making a mockumentary about the band, presenting the boys as music icons akin to The Beatles. In a TV Guide interview in early 2007, Draper explained, [...] "What originally happened was that Nat and Alex had a band, and the idea evolved based on that. Spinal Tap meets The Little Rascals was my concept... <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> that Help! or A Hard Day's Night kind of feeling." ...|$|E
500|$|The press {{were given}} {{advanced}} {{copies of the}} episode. Matthew Weiner pronounced himself shocked by what he considered spoilers in the review. Weiner criticized the episode's review by Alessandra Stanley of the New York Times, expressing that the publication revealed too much information. [...] He continued: [...] "I'm kind of powerless. It's the bargain you make. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> press, and {{it was nice to}} get that kind of space with those pictures. The alternative is not to share these things with the press any more – but how can you expect journalists to write about the show if you don’t? It was all very disappointing to me.|$|E

500|$|Cornell {{stated that}} the biggest two {{influences}} on [...] "You Know My Name" [...] were Tom Jones, who performed the theme for Thunderball, and Paul McCartney, who composed and performed the theme for Live and Let Die. [...] "I decided that I was going to sing it like Tom Jones, in that crooning style. I wanted people to hear my voice," [...] Cornell said. [...] "And 'Live and Let Die' is a fantastic song. Paul McCartney wouldn't have written it if not for that movie. I [...] {{wanted to write a}} song in its own universe. I knew I'd never have it again — a big orchestra — so <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> fun with it." [...] Cornell did not put the film's title in the lyrics, because he [...] "couldn't imagine it fitting into a song lyric that would come out of my mouth". And he jokingly stated [...] "Casino Royale didn't make a good rock title, but I would write a song named Octopussy just for fun".|$|E
500|$|When writing lyrics for {{previous}} releases, Moore would [...] "start mumbling and I try {{to figure}} out what I'm saying and then try to make it make sense". With Blood, he [...] "really wrote them down and tried to make them coherent. I didn't want it to be like 'Oh, you get your own impression of the lyrics. Everybody has their own idea!' <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an idea that I wanted to communicate, and something communicable." [...] Moore noted that he did occasionally use his [...] "mumbling" [...] method as it [...] "puts you in the right direction as far as sounds, vowel sounds, and stresses on certain syllables. And if you can write some words and lyrics that match that, sometimes it flows really well." [...] He described all the songs as based on [...] "personal experiences". [...] "I'll start writing a song that has a little bit of a world view or political view or something," [...] he said, [...] "but then by the time I'm finished the lyrics it'll be about a relationship or something like that." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} the album Hu Hu Hu (2009) Lafourcade experienced writer's block, {{and felt that}} the songs she was writing were too {{similar to those in}} her previous albums. For her new work, she sought inspiration from Agustín Lara's repertoire and her native country, Mexico. [...] "One of the things I wanted to happen with this record was to find the connection with Mexico and its people again". She said she was a Mexican and proud of the [...] "very many" [...] positive parts it has. Musically, she wanted more simplicity in her songs. Lafourcade forced herself to write [...] "without judgement", recording voice memos on her phone as part of the writing process. She was inspired by the works of Latin American songwriters such as Simón Díaz, Violeta Parra, Mercedes Sosa, Chavela Vargas, and Caetano Veloso. While recording demos, Lafourcade realized that the songs were more direct and emotional than her previous work. The writing took three years, resulting in approximately 30songs. Since the album was about her personal life, she selected what she felt were [...] "the strongest ones", saying, [...] "more than making an album, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> songs... that could stand on their own".|$|E

500|$|Matheos and Moore {{primarily}} work alone, exchanging {{files and}} ideas by email. The writing process for all OSI's albums {{has been the}} same, with Matheos sending Moore an idea [...] "from just a guitar riff to elaborate, almost completed songs", which Moore then edits and sends back to Matheos. Moore, the band's vocalist and lyricist, has described {{the process of writing}} lyrics as an [...] "audio Rorschach test". The lyrics on Office of Strategic Influence feature political themes, but the lyrics on later releases are less political, instead being based on Moore's personal experiences. [...] "I'll start writing a song that has {{a little bit of a}} world view or political view or something," [...] he said, [...] "but then by the time I'm finished the lyrics it'll be about a relationship or something like that." [...] On Blood, Moore largely abandoned his earlier stream-of-consciousness approach to writing lyrics, in an attempt to make the lyrics more coherent. [...] "I didn't want it to be like 'Oh, you get your own impression of the lyrics.

500|$|By {{the mid-1960s}} Harrison {{had become an}} admirer of Indian culture and mysticism, {{introducing}} {{it to the other}} Beatles. During the filming of Help! in the Bahamas, they met the founder of Sivananda Yoga, Swami Vishnu-devananda, who gave each of them a signed copy of his book, The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga. Between {{the end of the last}} Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the Sgt Pepper recording sessions, he made a pilgrimage to India with his wife Pattie; there, he studied sitar with Ravi Shankar, met several gurus, and visited various holy places. In 1968 he travelled to Rishikesh in northern India with the other Beatles to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Harrison's use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism. He commented: [...] "For me, it was like a flash. The first time I had acid, it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me, and I realized a lot of things. I didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them. From the moment I had that, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> it all the time – these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi's music." ...|$|E

500|$|With the {{financial}} and critical success of Jaws, Spielberg earned {{a vast amount of}} creative control from Columbia, including the right to make the film any way he wanted. Schrader turned in his script, which Spielberg called, [...] "one of the most embarrassing screenplays ever professionally turned in to a major film studio or director. It was a terribly guilt-ridden story not about UFOs at all." [...] Titled Kingdom Come, the script's protagonist was a 45-year-old Air Force Officer named Paul Van Owen who worked with Project Blue Book. [...] " [...] job for the government is to ridicule and debunk flying saucers." [...] Schrader continued. [...] "One day he has an encounter. He goes to the government, threatening to blow the lid off to the public. Instead, he and the government spend 15 years trying to make contact." [...] Spielberg and Schrader experienced creative differences, hiring John Hill to rewrite. At one point the main character was a police officer. Spielberg [...] " [...] it hard to identify with men in uniform. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Mr. Everyday Regular Fella." [...] Spielberg rejected the Schrader/Hill script during post-production on Jaws. He reflected, [...] "they wanted to make it like a James Bond adventure." ...|$|E
500|$|The band {{began to}} grow {{suspicious}} that Secor was keeping the money from selling the tape, and contacted their lawyer – Joe Escalante of The Vandals, who also owned independent record label Kung Fu Records. The group informed as Escalante that they believed [...] "someone's bootlegging it," [...] and requested his legal help to stop Secor. In exchange for legal fees, Blink-182 would allow Escalante's label, Kung Fu, to re-release Buddha on compact disc. The band had told Secor to not sell any more copies of the tape, but they held suspicions that he had anyway. Anonymously, Escalante ordered a tape from Secor, and Secor sold it to him. The band asserted {{that they were not}} receiving royalties for these sales. [...] "I paid off all of the royalties for the remaining stash of tapes that I had of Buddha," [...] said Secor in 2001. [...] "It was about 25. The tapes sold for five bucks, and I gave them half of what their profit would be. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a few to give to people and to have on hand." [...] Secor felt it was his right to sell his stock of the tape, as the band [...] "had been paid royalties for that already." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive reviews, {{with multiple}} critics lauding {{the performances of}} actors Anna Torv and John Noble. In his review for Entertainment Weekly, critic Ken Tucker wrote this his [...] "mind was blown not once, but twice" [...] due to the many revelations about two universes; Fringe [...] "has vaulted to {{the upper reaches of}} current television". In a second review, Tucker praised the [...] "beautifully, startlingly executed" [...] special effects when the [...] "hole" [...] in the universe closed. Writing for The A.V. Club, critic Zach Handlen gave the episode an A, and felt the episode made him {{want to go back and}} rewatch season one because the finale had [...] "so many references and back story nods that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> everything in my head together". Andrew Hanson from the Los Angeles Times thought the finale [...] "leads to a wealth of possibilities... The déjà universe was a bold move. I can’t wait to see what our friends at Fringe do with it". Writing for the Chicago Tribune, critic Maureen Ryan heaped praise on the [...] "excellent" [...] episode, and complimented [...] "the quietly creepy atmosphere, the slowly building tension in the dual Walter/Olivia stories, the way those stories were skillfully woven together, the suitably tense lakeside encounter between Olivia, Peter and Mr. Jones".|$|E

When she was first scouted to appear in an Adult Video she was receptive to the idea.

2500|$|The {{original}} screenplay consisted {{mostly of}} dialog and featured {{only a few}} changes from Crumb's stories. The script and storyboards went largely unused {{in favor of more}} experimental storytelling techniques. Bakshi said, [...] "I don't like to jump ahead on my films. The way you feel about a film on Day One, you may not feel the same way forty weeks down the road. Characters grow, so <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the option to change things, and strengthen my characters... It was sort of a stream of consciousness, and a learning process for myself." [...] Bakshi wrote the characters without feral animal behavior to lend the material greater realism.|$|E

They remain a mystery. I talked about this yesterday with a friend: do we focus on finding a person who fits with us, or will we remain single? I am open to both. If the right one comes – wonderful.

2500|$|Blackwell {{attended}} Catholic University {{where she}} majored in vocal {{music education and}} also spent time in activities and classes related to the University's drama and musical theater programs. Blackwell said, [...] "I wasn't quite sure whether I wanted to pursue classical or musical theater. I knew that whichever I chose, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a classical training. It {{was important to me}} to have the technical expertise as well as also the theory and understanding of classical music. Catholic University was the best of both possible worlds, because they had a very strong drama department as well as a very good music department. They were next door, so I spent quite a bit of time going {{back and forth between the}} drama department and the music department." [...] After graduating with her undergraduate degree in 1977, Blackwell taught music in two parochial schools while simultaneously continuing her vocal studies on the graduate level at Catholic University. She graduated with a Masters in Vocal Performance in 1980.|$|E
