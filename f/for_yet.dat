5|$|Between 13:00 and 14:00 General Bem amassed {{at least}} 64 {{artillery}} pieces {{on a narrow}} front near Forts 21, 22 and 23, and started firing on the artillery and infantry of the I Russian Corps. In the artillery barrage that lasted until 17:00, the forces of Russian I and II Corps were eventually forced to withdraw behind the ramparts of the captured forts. On several occasions the Russian cavalry of General Khilkov (including the Cuirassier Regiment) tried to charge the Polish artillery positions, but every time the charge was bloodily repelled with grapeshot and canister shot. Eventually the Russian cavalry withdrew from battle {{all the way to}} Górce. Half of the Russian artillery fought an intense artillery duel with the Poles, while the other half started shelling the suburb of Wola and Polish positions behind the second line of defences. Although the barrage prepared the field <b>for</b> <b>yet</b> another Polish counter-attack, Krukowiecki would not risk it.|$|E
5|$|In mid-spring 946, al-Ikhshid sent emissaries to the Byzantines <b>for</b> <b>yet</b> another {{prisoner}} exchange (which eventually {{would take}} place under Sayf al-Dawla's auspices in October). Emperor Constantine VII (r. 913–959) sent an embassy under John Mystikos in response, which arrived at Damascus on 11 July. On 24 July 946, al-Ikhshid died in Damascus. The succession of his son Unujur was peaceful and undisputed, due {{to the influence of}} the powerful and talented commander-in-chief, Kafur. One of the many Black African slaves recruited by al-Ikhshid, Kafur remained the paramount minister and virtual ruler of Egypt over the next 22 years, assuming power in his own right in 966 until his death two years later. Encouraged by his death, in 969 the Fatimids invaded and conquered Egypt, beginning a new era in the country's history.|$|E

5|$|On 23 March, Cormoran {{returned}} to Sydney <b>for</b> <b>yet</b> another annual overhaul. Afterward, she resumed her typical cruising duties in the German Pacific colonies.

She received another major overhaul in Tsingtau in May 1912, which was followed by surveying cruises in the German colonies. She {{did not return to}} Apia until 10 January 1913. Cormoran was reclassified as a gunboat on 24 February 1913 by order of Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, the State Secretary of the Reichsmarineamt (Imperial Navy Office). From 4 June to 5 July, she underwent repairs in Sydney. She was then obliged to stop in Bougainville due to tribal feuds on the island. She landed her shore party to assist the Polizeitruppen in suppressing the conflict. She departed for Tsingtau for further repair work in early 1914, arriving on 30 May.|$|E
5|$|On the Hokies' second {{offensive}} possession, quarterback Tyrod Taylor {{took the}} field in place of Sean Glennon. Two successful passes and two short runs resulted in two first downs and Virginia Tech advanced the ball across the 50-yard line and into Boston College territory. As Taylor attempted to scramble <b>for</b> <b>yet</b> another short run, however, he was tackled behind {{the line of scrimmage}} and fumbled the ball. The loose ball was scooped up by Boston College defender Jamie Silva, who returned it 51yards for a touchdown. The touchdown and subsequent extra point were the first points of the game and gave Boston College a 70 lead with 4minutes remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|On {{the ensuing}} kickoff, Egekeze {{attempted}} {{to kick the}} ball as it fell off the tee. This resulted in an unintentional squib that was returned 36yards to the Terps' nine-yard line. Nevada's Kaepernick attempted to rush but was stopped for no gain. On the next play, he threw {{the ball into the}} end zone, but it was intercepted by Maryland safety Kenny Tate, resulting in a touchback. The Terps started on their own 20-yard line, and running back Davin Meggett rushed for 13yards and a first down. Turner then linked up with freshman receiver Ronnie Tyler for another first down at the Maryland 49-yard line. After a false start penalty, the Terps were unable to gain a first down and punted the ball away. The ball rolled into the end zone for a touchback, and Nevada started the final drive of the quarter at its 20-yard line. Kaepernick then passed for two first downs, picked up another due to a pass interference call against Maryland, and scrambled <b>for</b> <b>yet</b> another. He then handed off to Taua, who rushed 17yards for a touchdown. Nevada re-took the lead, 14–13, with 46 seconds remaining in the quarter.|$|E

5|$|The climax {{is reached}} on Dr. Impossible's island, as he {{attempts}} to start a controlled Ice Age, making him Earth's ruler and only source of energy. He almost succeeds, using the hammer formerly belonging to the supervillain The Pharaoh to defeat the New Champions. CoreFire suddenly returns but is also unsuccessful against Dr. Impossible. Lily, who had quit the team earlier, eventually returns and defeats Dr. Impossible. Lily reveals that she is actually Erica Lowenstein, Dr. Impossible's childhood crush before his transformation and frequent kidnapee when she was the girlfriend of CoreFire. In the final chapter, Dr. Impossible ponders what it truly means to conquer the world, and whether such a feat can really be achieved, as he prepares <b>for</b> <b>yet</b> another escape from custody to start the cycle all over again with a new plan.|$|E
5|$|The tale's disappointing qualities {{have been}} {{ascribed}} to Potter's growing {{lack of interest}} in writing for children, to pressure from her publisher <b>for</b> <b>yet</b> another book, and to Potter's desire to exploit the lucrative American market. Potter's artistically successful books were written for specific children; Timmy Tiptoes however was composed for Potter's amorphous, ill-defined American fanbase. By 1911, the demands of her aging parents and the business operations at her working farm, Hill Top, occupied much of Potter's time and attention to the exclusion of nearly everything else, and are accounted as some {{of the reasons for the}} author's declining artistry and her {{lack of interest in}} producing children's books.|$|E

5|$|Arkansas again escorted {{a convoy}} to Scotland, {{returning}} to New York by 20 October. Thereafter, convoys {{were sent to}} North Africa, to support the invasion of North Africa. Arkansas covered her first such convoy, along with eight destroyers, on 3 November. She returned to New York on 11 December, where she went into dock for another overhaul. On 2 January 1943, Arkansas departed New York to conduct gunnery training in Chesapeake Bay. Back in New York by 30 January, the ship's crew prepared {{for a return to}} convoy escort duty. She escorted two convoys to Casablanca, between February and April, before returning to New York, <b>for</b> <b>yet</b> another period in drydock, which lasted until 26 May. Arkansas returned to duty as a training ship for midshipmen based at Norfolk. She resumed her convoy escort duties after four months, and on 8 October, she steamed to Bangor, Northern Ireland. She remained in Northern Ireland, through November, and departed on 1 December, bound for New York. After arriving on 12 December, Arkansas went into dock for more repairs, and then returned to Norfolk, on 27 December.

5|$|Galileo is lesser known <b>for,</b> <b>yet</b> still {{credited}} with, {{being one}} of the first to understand sound frequency. By scraping a chisel at different speeds, he linked the pitch of the sound produced to the spacing of the chisel's skips, a measure of frequency. In 1638, Galileo described an experimental method to measure the speed of light by arranging that two observers, each having lanterns equipped with shutters, observe each other's lanterns at some distance. The first observer opens the shutter of his lamp, and, the second, upon seeing the light, immediately opens the shutter of his own lantern. The time between the first observer's opening his shutter and seeing the light from the second observer's lamp indicates the time it takes light to travel back and forth between the two observers. Galileo reported that when he tried this at a distance of less than a mile, he was unable to determine whether or not the light appeared instantaneously. Sometime between Galileo's death and 1667, the members of the Florentine Accademia del Cimento repeated the experiment over a distance of about a mile and obtained a similarly inconclusive result. We now know that the speed of light is far too fast to be measured by such methods (with human shutter-openers on Earth).|$|E
