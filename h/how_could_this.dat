5|$|I've {{always been}} drawn to her story. More than anything, drawn to her {{commitment}} to what she believed in. In the face of death, she did not back down. And that is a theme that resonates with me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. I mean, she was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was dressed like a boy, and <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>this</b> person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be something wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't back down, and I admire that.|$|E

Reiter characterized [...] "Sue throwing Aural Intensity's 'chipper homosexual' choir director down the stairs, twice" [...] as a [...] "false note" [...] {{and said it was}} [...] "particularly difficult to take", though VanDerWerff called it [...] "kind of funny". Semigran was one reviewer who noted that Mercedes was wrong when she [...] "complains that there are no songs that convey alcohol is bad".

2500|$|After {{separating}} from Gordon, Jackson cloistered {{herself in}} her home and lived alone for the first time—the first six months she stated she never actually left her house due to being terrified of Gordon seeing her. Weary after her years of public scorn, she didn't {{know what to do}} with her life and was afraid to perform again. Jackson struggled to rebuild her confidence but was plagued with self-doubt, explaining, [...] "I got to the point, [...] where—well, you know in the media they say things like, 'Oh, she can't sing. She has no talent. She can't dance.' I started believing that, and I was thinking, 'Oh my God'. And I started thinking, 'Oh gee, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>this</b> happen to me?' How could I start believing this?". After this time she started to perform in Europe and South America occasionally to start making money to pay off the huge debts which Gordon had accumulated in her name while they were married. In the wake of the September 11 attacks Jackson was moved to compose [...] "Free the World". She performed the song for friends to a positive reception. This spurred on Jackson to write more songs, ending up with a full album, Startin' Over.|$|E
