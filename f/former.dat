40|$|This is a prospective, case control out patient based {{study was}} conducted, at Fath ElRahman Elbashier refered clinic, Ibin Sina Hospital and Khartoum North Hospital and Khartoum Teaching Hospital {{in the period}} April 2007 to June 2007. In this study, serum level of calcium, {{phosphate}}, uric acid and urine creatinine, calcium, phosphate, uric acid pH, and urinary crystal count for calcium oxalate, phosphate and urate was counted in 40 stone <b>formers</b> and 15 non stone <b>formers</b> control. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the difference between stone <b>formers</b> and non stones <b>formers</b> and also the difference between recurrent stone <b>formers</b> and single stone <b>formers</b> in urine and blood chemistry. The results was compared between stone <b>formers</b> and control and recurrent stone <b>formers</b> against single stone <b>formers,</b> and also the effect of urinary pH on crystallization on calcium oxalate, phosphate and urate. The study concluded that there was statistically significant increase in the level of serum calcium, urinary calcium/ creatinine ratio, uric acid/ creatinine ratio, urinary calcium oxalate count/ HPF and also urate crystals/HPF among stone <b>formers</b> compared to control. The study also shows a significant increase in the level of urinary calcium, urinary ca/cr ratio, urinary calcium oxalate count/HPF, phosphate crystal/HPF and urate crystals count/HPF in recurrent stone <b>formers</b> compared to single stone <b>formers.</b> The study show a significant increase in phosphate crystallization with increase urinary pH and increase in urate crystallization of urate with a decrease in urinary pH. Finally this study recommends the use of analyte/ creatinine ratio instead of 24 hours urinary collection, and the use of urinary crystals counts to monitor the management of patients with urinary stones. Finally we recommends that a large prospective study should be carried to monitor all factors involved in stone formation e. g oxalate excretion to generalize these findings, and use them in management of urinary lithesiasis...|$|R

The purpose of this system is to recover the source signal from the interference. This paper explains the concept and algorithms of beam forming based on review of relevant literature. Conventional methods as well as advanced algorithms regarding acoustic beam forming are discussed. There are basically two types of beam <b>formers,</b> signal independent beam <b>formers</b> or conventional beam <b>formers</b> and signal dependent beam <b>formers</b> or adaptive beam <b>formers.</b> The main purpose is to allow signal from a desired direction and to remove interference.

40|$|Purpose: Urolithiasis {{develops}} {{more frequently}} in patients with a family history (FHx). However, {{little is known about}} risk factors in stone <b>formers</b> with a FHx. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the clinico-metabolic characteristics of urinary stone <b>formers</b> according to FHx. Materials and Methods: A database of 1, 068 stone <b>formers</b> who underwent a complete metabolic evaluation was reviewed. The patients were divided into two groups on the basis of the presence of a FHx. Clinical factors and metabolic parameters were compared between the two groups. Results: There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics, such as gender, age, body mass index, stone episodes, or multiple stones, between the two groups (p> 0. 05, respectively). Compared with stone <b>formers</b> without a FHx, however, serum calcium concentrations were more elevated in stone <b>formers</b> with a FHx. Also, the urinary excretion of calcium was higher in stone <b>formers</b> with a FHx than in those without a FHx. Other urinary metabolites showed no significant differences between the two groups (p> 0. 05, respectively). Conclusions: Our study revealed that stone <b>formers</b> with a FHx had increased urinary calcium excretion as well as elevated concentrations of serum calcium. This finding suggests that urolithiasis in stone <b>formers</b> with a FHx may be associated with calcium metabolic abnormalities...|$|R
