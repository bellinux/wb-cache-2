5|$|Although {{the size}} of noble {{households}} shrank slightly during the 16th century, the number of <b>guests</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> largest castle events continued to grow. 2,000 came to a feast at Cawood Castle in 1466, while the Duke of Buckingham routinely entertained up to 519 people at Thornbury Castle {{at the start of}} the 16th century.

With this scale of living and entertainment the need to find more space in older castles became a major issue in both England and Scotland.|$|E

Stewart later discussed the ban with guest Keira Knightley.|$|E
