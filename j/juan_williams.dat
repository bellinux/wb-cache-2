500|$|In February 2007, a Leflore County grand jury, {{composed}} {{primarily of}} black jurors and empaneled by Joyce Chiles, a black prosecutor, found no credible basis for Beauchamp's claim that 14 people {{took part in}} Till's abduction and murder. Beauchamp was angry with the finding. David Beito and <b>Juan</b> <b>Williams,</b> {{who worked on the}} reading materials for the Eyes on the Prize documentary, were critical of Beauchamp for trying to revise history and taking attention away from other cold cases. The grand jury failed to find sufficient cause for charges against Carolyn Bryant Donham. [...] Neither the FBI nor the grand jury found any credible evidence that Henry Lee Loggins, identified by Beauchamp as a suspect who could be charged, had any role in the crime. Other than Loggins, Beauchamp refused to name any of the people he alleged were involved.|$|E
50|$|Mark West died in 1849, {{leaving his}} land {{to his wife}} and seven {{children}} (Maria Luisa Del Carmet, Mark, <b>Juan,</b> <b>William,</b> Charles, Adelaide, and Chata).

The US Attorney General filed an appeal with the case to the US Supreme Court. The Supreme Court accepted one and a half square leagues, and the grant was patented to Guadalupe Vasquez de West in 1865.|$|R

Ailes apologized to a Jewish group, but not to NPR, for using the expression, writing to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL): [...] "I was of course ad-libbing and should not have chosen that word, but I was angry at the time because of NPR's willingness to censor <b>Juan</b> <b>Williams</b> for not being liberal enough...

NPR disavowed Schiller's comments. CEO Vivian Schiller, who is not related to Ronald, later resigned over the fallout from the comments and the previous firing of <b>Juan</b> <b>Williams.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On a September 2007 {{edition of}} The Radio Factor, while having a {{discussion}} about race with fellow Fox News commentator and author <b>Juan</b> <b>Williams</b> about a meal he shared with Al Sharpton, O'Reilly said [...] "You know when Sharpton and I walked in, it was like... big commotion and everything. But everybody was very nice. And I couldn't get {{over the fact that}} there was no difference between Sylvia's Restaurant and any other restaurant in New York City. I mean, it was exactly the same, even though it's run by blacks, primarily black patronship." [...] He commented that no one in Sylvia's [...] was [...] "screaming 'M'Fer, I want more iced tea.'" [...] He further added, [...] "I think that black Americans are starting to think more and more for themselves, getting away from the Sharptons and the Jacksons and people trying to lead them into a race-based culture. They're just trying to figure it out. 'Look, I can make it. If I work hard and get educated, I can make it.'" [...] The statement drew criticism from a number of places. Roland S. Martin of CNN said that the notion that black people are just now starting to value education is [...] "ridiculous" [...] and that the notion that black people let Sharpton or Jackson think for them is [...] "nuts". Media Matters for America covered the story on a number of occasions. O'Reilly responded, saying, [...] "It was an attempt to tell the radio audience that there is no difference—black, white, we're all Americans. The stereotypes they see on television are not true" [...] and also called out Media Matters, claiming that [...] "Media Matters distorted the entire conversation and implied I was racist for condemning racism." [...] <b>Juan</b> <b>Williams</b> said the criticism of O'Reilly was [...] "rank dishonesty" [...] and that the original comments [...] "had nothing to do with racist ranting by anybody except by these idiots at CNN." [...] Williams went on to say it was [...] "frustrating" [...] that the media try to criticize anyone who wanted to have an honest discussion about race.|$|E
2500|$|The Rimac’s capture, {{the sinking}} of the Esmeralda and the passiveness of the Chilean fleet all showed that the command of the navy wasn't {{prepared}} for the war, and the army also had trouble with the logistics, medical service and command. Public discontent with the wrong decisions led to riots and the government had to replace the [...] "sclerotics" [...] chief of the navy <b>Juan</b> <b>Williams</b> Rebolledo (by Galvarino Riveros), and the Chief of the army Justo Arteaga (by Erasmo Escala). After Tarapacá, the army was reorganized in divisions. Regarding her foreign policy, Chile tried to separate Bolivia from Peru. Gonzalo Bulnes writes: The target of the [...] "política boliviana" [...] was the same as before, to seize Tacna und Arica for Bolivia and put Bolivia as a Buffer state between Peru and Chile, on the assumption that Peru would accept the Chilean peace conditions. The initiated called such policy [...] "to clear up Bolivia". Moreover, the Chilean government had to find an agreement with Argentina about the border also to avert a war.|$|E

5000|$|The {{location}} was originally called Tsézhin Deezʼáhí in Navajo, {{a reference to}} its rock formations. The site of a useful crossing of the Little Colorado River, it was later called El Vadito (Spanish for [...] "the little crossing") by Spaniards as they first explored the area. Starting in 1864, a trader named Solomon Barth began crossing the area as he moved salt from a salt lake in Zuni territory to Prescott, Arizona. In a poker game in 1873 Barth earned enough money to purchase cattle and enough land in St. Johns to start a ranch with his brothers Nathan and Morris. He changed the name from El Vadito to San Juan. There is some controversy as to whether this was {{in honor of the}} first woman resident, Maria San Juan Baca de Padilla, or of the feast of San <b>Juan.</b> <b>William</b> R. Milligan arrived in 1866, followed by Frank Walker in 1870. By 1872 a Spanish-American agricultural community had developed. A stone cabin was erected by Juan Sedilla in 1874. Solomon Barth sold out to Mormon Ammon M. Tenney in 1875 or 1879. A Mormon community named Salem and led by David King Udall was established just north of the town under the direction of Wilford Woodruff on March 29, 1880, and then moved to higher ground by Erastus Snow on September 19 of the same year.|$|R
