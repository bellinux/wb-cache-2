5|$|Like its art, Palmyra's {{architecture}} {{was influenced}} by the Greco-Roman style, while preserving local elements (best seen in the Temple of Bel). <b>Enclosed</b> <b>by</b> a massive wall flanked with traditional Roman columns, Bel's sanctuary plan was primarily Semitic. Similar to the Second Temple, the sanctuary consisted of a large courtyard with the deity's main shrine off-center against its entrance (a plan preserving elements of the temples of Ebla and Ugarit).|$|E
5|$|Like most insects, the Lepidoptera are oviparous or 'egg-layers'. Lepidopteran eggs, {{like those}} of other insects, are centrolecithal in that the eggs have a central yolk {{surrounded}} by cytoplasm. The yolk provides the liquid nourishment for the embryo caterpillar until it escapes from the shell. The cytoplasm is <b>enclosed</b> <b>by</b> the vitteline envelope and a proteinaceous membrane called the chorion protects the egg externally. The zygote nucleus is located posteriorly.|$|E
5|$|A large mound on {{the south}} side of the plaza was once the Temple of Jakawitz, a deity of the {{mountains}} and the patron of the Ajaw K'iche' lineage. Like the other structures of Q'umarkaj, all the stone facing has been robbed, leaving only a rubble and mud core. This structure was part of a complex that consisted of a patio <b>enclosed</b> <b>by</b> the temple on the northern side, a palace {{on the south}}ern side and a long building on the east. The Jakawitz complex has not been investigated archaeologically. Drawings by Rivera y Maestre suggest that the temple was a narrow building with four or five terraces.|$|E

5|$|Addington Long Barrow is a {{chambered}} long barrow {{located near}} {{to the village of}} Addington in the southeastern English county of Kent. Constructed during Britain's Early Neolithic period, today it survives only in a ruined state. Built out of earth and around fifty local sarsen megaliths, the long barrow consisted of a sub-rectangular earthen tumulus <b>enclosed</b> <b>by</b> kerb-stones. Collapsed stones on the northeastern end of the chamber probably represented a stone chamber in which human remains might have been deposited; none, however, have been discovered.|$|E
5|$|Archaea and {{bacteria}} have generally similar cell structure, but cell composition and organization set the archaea apart. Like bacteria, archaea lack interior membranes and organelles. Like bacteria, the cell membranes of archaea are usually bounded by a cell wall and they swim using {{one or more}} flagella. Structurally, archaea are most similar to gram-positive bacteria. Most have a single plasma membrane and cell wall, and lack a periplasmic space; the exception to this general rule is Ignicoccus, which possess a particularly large periplasm that contains membrane-bound vesicles and is <b>enclosed</b> <b>by</b> an outer membrane.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} from various {{sites on the}} Iberian peninsula suggest the domestication {{of plants and animals}} between 6,000 and 4,500 BC. Céide Fields in Ireland, consisting of extensive tracts of land <b>enclosed</b> <b>by</b> stone walls, date to 3,500 BC and are the oldest known field systems in the world. The horse was domesticated in the Pontic steppe around 4,000 BC. In Siberia, Cannabis was in use in China in Neolithic times and may have been domesticated there; it was in use both as a fibre for ropemaking and as a medicine in Ancient Egypt by about 2,350 BC.|$|E

The two green vegetables were the only ones mentioned specifically in the laws, though uncultivated plants were still likely to be used in their cooking. The leek went on to be so important to Welsh cuisine—found in many symbolic dishes including cawl and Glamorgan sausage—that it became the country's national vegetable.|$|E
5|$|Dunstanburgh Castle's {{buildings}} are located {{around the outside}} of the fortification's outer bailey, <b>enclosed</b> <b>by</b> a stone curtain wall, which enclose , making it the largest castle in Northumberland. Possibly from the very start of the castle, and certainly by the 1380s, the castle buildings formed three distinct complexes supporting the Earl's household, the castle's constable and the administration of the Embleton barony respectively. The inside of the bailey still shows the marks of former strip farming, which can be seen in winter.|$|E

The Park is <b>enclosed</b> <b>by</b> woodland, sloped along the valley towards Dawlish, and is used for grazing. Church Park includes exotic trees from the 19th century, {{as well as an}} ornamental pond and waterfall from the same period. In the 20th century, some of the nearby woodland was felled to make glades.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the release}} of the Taylor Report in January 1990, Sunderland was obliged to make plans to turn their Roker Park home into an all-seater stadium. Roker Park was a ground that mainly {{consisted}} of standing terraces, and if converted into all-seater it would have held far fewer spectators than before. <b>Enclosed</b> <b>by</b> residential streets on all sides, expansion was practically impossible. So, by 1991, Sunderland chairman Bob Murray began investigating the possibility of relocation to a new stadium.|$|E

5|$|HIV is {{different}} in structure from other retroviruses. It is roughly spherical with a diameter of about 120nm, around 60times smaller than a red blood cell. It is composed of two copies of positive single-stranded RNA that codes for the virus's nine genes <b>enclosed</b> <b>by</b> a conical capsid composed of 2,000 copies of the viral protein p24. The single-stranded RNA is tightly bound to nucleocapsid proteins, p7, and enzymes needed {{for the development of}} the virion such as reverse transcriptase, proteases, ribonuclease and integrase. A matrix composed of the viral protein p17 surrounds the capsid ensuring the integrity of the virion particle.|$|E
