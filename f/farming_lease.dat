40|$|Many <b>farm</b> <b>leases,</b> {{especially}} those between family members, are not written but are verbal 2 ̆ 2 handshake 2 ̆ 2 agreements. Because nothing is in writing, the parties {{may have different}} recollections of their agreement, making lease disputes more difficult to resolve. In legal terms, verbal <b>farm</b> <b>leases</b> in Nebraska may be either 2 ̆ 2 year-to-year 2 ̆ 2 leases or 2 ̆ 2 holdover 2 ̆ 2 leases. Holdover leases result when a written lease terminates but the landlord and tenant continue the lease with an oral agreement, either directly or implied, without entering into a new written lease. The most common legal issue associated with verbal <b>farm</b> <b>leases</b> is how a lease may legally be terminated. For both year-to-year leases and holdover leases, six months advance notice {{must be given to}} legally terminate the lease. However, the lease date (the date from which the six months is counted) is different. In contrast, the termination of a written lease is determined by the terms of the written lease.

40|$|ISBN: 978 - 2 - 503 - 54359 - 8 Interpretation {{of ancient}} texts, {{such as the}} Amos epigraphic <b>farming</b> <b>leases,</b> {{questions}} both locations and spatial extents of the viticultural area, as well as soils, landscapes, cultivation techniques {{and the quality of}} grapes in the Ancient Greece. These issues may be partially answered undertaking spatial analysis of soils and landscape of the present day through digital morphometric and multispectral satellite data. This paper aims at discussing the possible locations of the ancient deme of Amos and identifying the additional data and methodological developments that will be needed for a further zoning of its componing terroir units. It compares the viticultural and geographical details given in the leases prescriptions with a preliminary spatial analysis of the Amos region (Bozburun peninsula, southwest Turkey) using digital morphometric ASTER GDM data and Landsat satellite data. The viticultural prescriptions in the Amos epigraphic <b>farming</b> <b>leases</b> discriminate between vineyards grown on “plains” and vineyards grown on “rocky terrain”. Considering written and epigraphic sources, distances to coast, distances to the Amos cape, regional morphology, geology, present land use together, we found out that the ancient Amos vineyards were likely to be located along the coastline in the Kumlubuk bay {{at the foot of the}} Amos cape...|$|R

Many Nebraska leases are unwritten, which means that notice of termination must be given at least six months in advance, usually by September 1. If the landowner cannot terminate the lease, the landowner cannot require the tenant to accept a higher rent in order to avoid immediate lease termination. However, prudent tenants would renegotiate the lease with the landowner in order to keep the lease longer. If a tenant refuses to renegotiate the rent, the tenant could end up ultimately losing the lease...|$|R

40|$|Based {{primarily}} on notarized <b>farm</b> <b>leases,</b> this thesis examines approaches to agriculture {{on the island}} of Montreal from 1780 to 1820. This source permits us to establish the crucial relationship between people and farms and to then link them to differences in capital investment, production and farming techniques. By understanding the common, day-to-day farming operations, we can address ourselves to the larger questions of what contributed to the state of Lower Canadian agriculture, a subject of contentious debate in Quebec historiography. The island of Montreal, already favoured by the geographic circumstances of climate, soil and location, was also a crucible for two profound changes which were occurring in Quebec society during this period [...] the beginning of a wave of English-speaking immigrants who would permanently alter the ethnic composition of the province's population, {{and the development of a}} significant urban market. In the 564 notarized <b>farm</b> <b>leases</b> passed in this forty-year period, half of the lessors were merchants and professionals, most of whom resided in the city and suburbs of Montreal. The farms of the urban bourgeoisie were on average larger and better-stocked than the farms of habitants, artisans and other proprietors. Most attempts at agricultural innovation and more intensive cultivation occurred on the farms of this elite, not on the lands owned by those with less capital resources: capital, not ethnicity, directed the approach taken to farming...|$|R
