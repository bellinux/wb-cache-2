5|$|Many mutagens {{fit into}} the space between two {{adjacent}} base pairs, this is called intercalation. Most intercalators are aromatic and planar molecules; examples include ethidium bromide, acridines, daunomycin, and doxorubicin. For an intercalator to <b>fit</b> <b>between</b> base pairs, the bases must separate, distorting the DNA strands by unwinding of the double helix. This inhibits both transcription and DNA replication, causing toxicity and mutations. As a result, DNA intercalators may be carcinogens, {{and in the case}} of thalidomide, a teratogen. Others such as benzopyrene diol epoxide and aflatoxin form DNA adducts that induce errors in replication. Nevertheless, due to their ability to inhibit DNA transcription and replication, other similar toxins are also used in chemotherapy to inhibit rapidly growing cancer cells.|$|E
5|$|Temnospondyls' {{vertebrae}} {{are divided}} into several segments. In living tetrapods, {{the main body of}} the vertebra is a single piece of bone called the centrum, but in temnospondyls, this region was divided into a pleurocentrum and intercentrum. Two types of vertebrae are recognized in temnospondyls: stereospondylous and rhachitomous vertebrae.'In rhachitomous vertebrae, the intercentra are large and wedge-shaped, and the pleurocentra are relatively small blocks that <b>fit</b> <b>between</b> them.' Both elements support a spine-like neural arch, and well-developed interlocking projections called zygapophyses strengthen the connections between vertebrae. The strong backbone and strong limbs of many ratchitomous temnospondyls allowed them to be partially, and in some cases fully, terrestrial. In stereospondylous vertebrae, the pleurocentra have been lost entirely, with the intercentra enlarged as {{the main body of the}} vertebrae. This weaker type of backbone indicates that stereospondylous temnospondyls spent more time in water.|$|E
25|$|In several senses {{there is}} a natural <b>fit</b> <b>between</b> human {{security}} concepts and humanitarian principles. The concern with the protection of people or individuals is a core humanitarian value as well as of human security. In this sense it shares human securityâ€™s merging of development and security and the casting of the protection of life as the referent object.|$|E

C.C.N.V., 468 U.S. 288 (1984), in which it held that the nexus need merely be reasonable. The Court also merged its doctrine of time-place-manner restrictions and the O'Brien test into an intermediate scrutiny hybrid.|$|E
25|$|People of Inca civilization were {{masters of}} the {{polished}} 'dry-stone walls', called ashlar, where blocks of stone were cut to fit together tightly without any mortar. The Incas were among the best stonemasons {{the world has ever}} seen and many junctions in their masonry were so perfect that even blades of grass could not <b>fit</b> <b>between</b> the stones.|$|E
25|$|Dr. John A. Jane {{performed}} {{surgery to}} repair Reeve's neck vertebrae. He put wires underneath both laminae and used bone from Reeve's hip to <b>fit</b> <b>between</b> the C1 and C2 vertebrae. He inserted a titanium pin and fused the wires with the vertebrae, then drilled holes in Reeve's skull and fitted the wires through to secure the skull to the spinal column.|$|E

25|$|A {{serious problem}} with the Aichi and Kawasaki version of the Dailmer-Benz engine was that of holding a close {{tolerance}} <b>fit</b> <b>between</b> the crankshaft and its bearings on this fairly long engine. The result was that the engine proved {{to be prone to}} crankshaft failure. Additionally, there was often great difficulties obtaining engine components which, along with repeated air attacks on the Atsuta engine plant, eventually brought engine production to a standstill.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a modern}} {{revolver}} of Russian design, the OTs-38, which uses ammunition that incorporates the silencing mechanism into the cartridge case, making the gap between cylinder and barrel irrelevant {{as far as the}} suppression issue is concerned. The OTs-38 does need an unusually close and precise <b>fit</b> <b>between</b> the cylinder and barrel due to the shape of bullet in the special ammunition (Soviet SP-4), which was originally designed for use in a semi-automatic.|$|E
25|$|Their {{experiment}} revealed {{linkage between}} the P and L alleles and the p and l alleles. The frequency of P occurring together with L and p occurring together with l {{is greater than}} that of the recombinant Pl and pL. The recombination frequency is more difficult to compute in an F2 cross than a backcross, but the lack of <b>fit</b> <b>between</b> observed and expected numbers of progeny in the above table indicate it is less than 50%.|$|E

25|$|Double seam rims {{are crucial}} to the joining of the wall to a top or bottom surface. An {{extremely}} tight <b>fit</b> <b>between</b> the pieces must be accomplished to prevent leakage; the process of accomplishing this radically deforms the rims of the parts. Part of the tube that forms the wall is bent, almost at its end, turning outward through 90 degrees, and then bent further, {{toward the middle of}} the tube, until it is parallel {{to the rest of the}} tube, a total bend of 180 degrees.|$|E
25|$|As {{locomotive}} types {{began to}} diverge {{in the late}} 19th century, freight engine designs at first emphasised tractive effort, whereas those for passenger engines emphasised speed. Over time, freight locomotive size increased, and {{the overall number of}} axles increased accordingly; the leading bogie was usually a single axle, but a trailing truck was added to larger locomotives to support a larger firebox that could no longer <b>fit</b> <b>between</b> or above the driving wheels. Passenger locomotives had leading bogies with two axles, fewer driving axles, and very large driving wheels in order to limit the speed at which the reciprocating parts had to move.|$|E
25|$|In {{a recent}} 2016 article, {{an entirely new}} {{communication}} device and non-EEG-based human-computer interface was developed, requiring no visual fixation or ability to move eyes at all, {{that is based on}} covert interest in (i.e. without fixing eyes on) chosen letter on a virtual keyboard with letters each having its own (background) circle that is micro-oscillating in brightness in different time transitions, where the letter selection is based on best <b>fit</b> <b>between,</b> on one hand, unintentional pupil-size oscillation pattern, and, on the other hand, the circle-in-background's brightness oscillation pattern. Accuracy is additionally improved by user's mental rehearsing the words 'bright' and 'dark' in synchrony with the brightness transitions of the circle/letter.|$|E

25|$|Its hammer {{action is}} built into a {{removable}} assembly for easy maintenance, after the fashion of the Tokarev TT-30 pistol, whereas its slide rides inside the frame rails, rather than outside as in the traditional Browning pattern. This latter feature mimics the frame-to-receiver interface of its predecessor in Swiss military service, the Luger pistol, allowing for a very tight <b>fit</b> <b>between</b> the slide, barrel and frame without compromising reliability. This construction feature contributes to the unusually high accuracy for which the SIG P210 is known. It ships with a 50-meter (54.7 yd) test target typically showing a group of five to ten shots in a cluster under 5cm (2in) in diameter.|$|E
25|$|Lozenge {{camouflage}} came {{in varying}} widths, sometimes in 4.5-foot-wide (1.4 m) bolts of fabric, and pieces were cut to <b>fit</b> <b>between</b> the leading and trailing {{edges of the}} wing. Fabric sections laid chordwise were lined up next to each other so that the pattern repeated itself regularly across the wing, except for the ailerons which were covered in fabric laid sparwise, perpendicular to the wing pattern. Some aircraft had the fabric applied diagonally. As a part of field repairs, regularly laid fabric patterns from the factory might be overlaid with the same pattern but at a different angle, or with fabric from a different camouflage design. Later in the war, some patterns were applied more quickly with fabric laid sparwise along the full wingspan. Hasty factory work began to resemble the rushed field repairs.|$|E
25|$|Various {{types of}} {{quantitative}} and semi-quantitative information {{are available to}} constrain past plate motions. The geometric <b>fit</b> <b>between</b> continents, such as between west Africa and South America is still {{an important part of}} plate reconstruction. Magnetic stripe patterns provide a reliable guide to relative plate motions going back into the Jurassic period. The tracks of hotspots give absolute reconstructions, but these are only available back to the Cretaceous. Older reconstructions rely mainly on paleomagnetic pole data, although these only constrain the latitude and rotation, but not the longitude. Combining poles of different ages in a particular plate to produce apparent polar wander paths provides a method for comparing the motions of different plates through time. Additional evidence comes from the distribution of certain sedimentary rock types, faunal provinces shown by particular fossil groups, and the position of orogenic belts.|$|E

25|$|Recruits in {{the early}} 18th century had to be {{physically}} and mentally <b>fit,</b> <b>between</b> 18 and 36 years old (1830 years from 1819, 1825 years from 1871) and at least 172 centimeters tall (175cm from 1775, lowered to 167cm from 1788 as the army was {{in dire need of}} soldiers during Gustav III's Russian War). Many soldiers served in the army for more than 30 years, as there was no service time stated in the contract; instead, being discharged required a reason, such as old age, injury, sickness, or the commission of a crime. Discharges were generally only given at general musters, held once a year, or even more sparsely, even though an interim discharge could be given by the regimental commander if the discharge was supported by the soldier. The interim discharge had to be confirmed at the next general muster.|$|E
25|$|Laterally compressed, or ziphodont teeth, are {{characteristic}} of Sebecus and other sebecosuchians. Although the teeth vary in size, they are homodont, having a similar shape throughout the jaw. At {{the tips of the}} upper and lower jaws, the teeth are rounder in cross-section. The fourth dentary tooth is raised in the lower jaw to form an effective canine. The foremost teeth of the lower jaw are much smaller and lower than the fourth tooth. At the tip of the jaw the first dentary tooth is procumbent, or directed forward. The teeth of the upper and lower jaws form an alternate pattern to allow the jaw to close tightly. A notch is present between the maxilla and premaxilla bones of the upper jaw, accommodating the fourth dentary tooth when the jaw is closed. The procumbent first dentary teeth <b>fit</b> <b>between</b> the first and second premaxillary teeth. This close fit allows the serrated edges of the teeth shear with one another.|$|E
