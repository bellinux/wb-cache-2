500|$|From 1958 to 1959 Williamson {{worked for}} Harvey Comics collaborating with former EC artists Reed Crandall, Torres and Krenkel and inking the pencils of Jack Kirby (for Race to the Moon #2–3 and Blast-Off #1). [...] On inking Kirby, Williamson relates: [...] "I {{remember}} {{going up to}} Harvey and getting work there. They said, 'We haven't got any work for you, but we have some stories here that Jack penciled. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> ink them?' I'd never really inked anybody else before, but I said, 'Sure,' because I looked at the stuff, and thought, I can follow this, it's all there. I inked it and they liked it, and they gave me three or four stories to do." ...|$|E

The Herald Sun wrote that the [...] "iLoo is, unquestionably, very good news – mainly to journalists with a bottomless pit of laboured bum jokes" [...] while the Seattle Times wrote [...] "now the company has a credibility problem as well as a red face."

500|$|Campbell {{was seen}} refusing to shake Rooney's {{hand at the}} final whistle {{and there were no}} {{customary}} shirt swaps between both sets of players; it was alleged that the Arsenal players wore T-shirts emblazoned with [...] "50 not out", though this has never been proven. Tempers boiled over in the players' tunnel in front of police officers. Several Arsenal players were held back, one of whom was Henry, incensed that Ferdinand claimed the man-of-the-match award. The conflict sparked into life when Wenger confronted Van Nistelrooy as he was unhappy with the striker's challenge on Cole. Ferguson intervened and told Wenger to leave his players alone, but the Arsenal manager faced him and said [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do about it?" ...|$|E
500|$|Like all {{the other}} republics of the Soviet Union, Armenia had its own flag and coat of arms. According to Nikita Khrushchev, the latter became a source of dispute between the Soviet Union and the Republic of Turkey in the 1950s, when Turkey objected to the {{inclusion}} of Mount Ararat, which holds a deep symbolic importance for Armenians but is located on Turkish territory, in the coat of arms. Turkey felt {{that the presence of}} such an image implied Soviet designs on Turkish territory. Khrushchev retorted by asking, [...] "Why do you have a moon depicted on your flag? After all, the moon doesn't belong to Turkey, not even half the moon... <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> take over the whole universe?" [...] Turkey dropped the issue after this.|$|E

500|$|Al Kooper {{recalled}} {{that both the}} album title, Blonde on Blonde, and song titles arrived during the mixing sessions. [...] "When they were mixing it, we were sitting around and Bob Johnston came in and said, 'What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> call this?' And [...] just like said them out one at a time... Free association and silliness, I'm sure, played a big role." [...] Another Dylan chronicler, Oliver Trager, notes that besides spelling out the initials of Dylan's first name, the album title is also a riff on Brecht on Brecht, a stage production based on works by German playwright Bertolt Brecht that had influenced his early songwriting. Dylan himself has said of the title: [...] "Well, I don't even recall exactly how it came up, but I know {{it was all in}} good faith... I don't know who thought of that. I certainly didn't." ...|$|E
500|$|Senior {{executives}} at publishers Michael Joseph {{and at the}} Sunday Times, which serialised the book, received threatening phone calls and a visit from private investigator Eugene Ingram, {{who worked for the}} Church. Another private investigator, Jarl Grieve Einar Cynewulf, told Sunday Times journalists that he had been offered [...] "large sums of money" [...] to find a link between Miller and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as the Church reportedly believed that the CIA was driving investigations into its tax affairs in the U.S. According to Cynewulf, Miller's mail and phones were intercepted and his home was under constant surveillance. The newspaper reported that Cynewulf had chased its reporter and photographer through the streets of Bristol, armed with a pistol which he fired at them, saying, [...] "You'd better go now unless you want to end up in a wooden box. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be another Hungerford martyr?" ...|$|E
500|$|Pavement had {{attained}} {{a degree of}} success within the underground music scene with its 1989 debut EP Slay Tracks (1933-1969). While Malkmus was traveling to parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, Kannberg managed Slay Tracks release on the band's self-owned label, Treble Kicker. Slay Tracks {{caught the attention of}} Dan Koretzky, an avid record collector working at Reckless Records in Chicago. Koretzky ordered 200 copies of the EP for the record store, and asked Kannberg to sign to his newly started independent label, Drag City. At the time the members of Pavement anticipated no further releases beyond Slay Tracks, and Kannberg initially expressed reluctance to sign to any label. Kannberg later said [...] "I started talking to [...] and in our conversations he said 'I'm starting this label. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do something for us?' I said, 'Well I don't know if we're even a band. Steve is off in Europe.' He said, [...] "Well if you want to I'm up for it.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Returning home, the Chili Peppers parted ways and, for {{the most}} part, {{remained}} secluded from {{each other through the}} rest of 1997. No new material was written during that time, and {{it was not until the}} beginning of 1998 that the band began rehearsal. At that point, Navarro had become dependent on drugs, with Kiedis also struggling to remain clean. The band decided they would have a talk with Navarro and attempt to convince him to enter rehab. The discussion escalated into a heated dispute, and Navarro fell over an amplifier in a drug-induced daze. In April 2010, Navarro discussed this incident, stating that: [...] "One [...] was [...] my drug use at the time. The other was musical differences. Anthony says it was because I tripped and fell over an amp while on drugs. I say that he was on more drugs than me at that point. We both had a loose relationship with reality.

500|$|By 1993, Windows {{had become}} {{the most widely used}} GUI {{operating}} system in the world. Fortune Magazine named Microsoft as the [...] "1993 Most Innovative Company Operating in the U.S." [...] The year also marked the end of a five-year copyright infringement legal case brought by Apple Computer, dubbed Apple Computer, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., in which the ruling was in Microsoft's favor. Microsoft also released Windows for Workgroups 3.11, {{a new version of the}} consumer line of Windows, and Windows NT 3.1, a server-based operating system with a similar user interface to consumer versions of the operating system, but with an entirely different kernel. As part of its strategy to broaden its business, Microsoft released Microsoft Encarta on March 22, 1993, the first encyclopedia designed to run on a computer. Soon after, the Microsoft Home brand was introduced– encompassing Microsoft's new multimedia applications for Windows 3.x., Microsoft changed its slogan to [...] "Where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> go today?" [...] in 1994 as part of an attempt to appeal to nontechnical audiences in a US$100 million advertising campaign.|$|E
500|$|Characters on Animaniacs had catchphrases, {{with some}} {{characters}} {{having more than}} one. Notable catchphrases include Yakko's [...] "Goodnight, everybody!" [...] often said following adult humor, Wakko's [...] "Faboo!" [...] and Dot's frequent assertions of her cuteness. The most prominent catchphrase that was said by all the Warners was [...] "Hello-o-o, nurse!" [...] Tom Ruegger said that the [...] "Hello-o-o, Nurse!" [...] line {{was intended to be}} a catchphrase much like Bugs Bunny's line, [...] "What's up, doc?" [...] Before the theme song for each [...] "Pinky and the Brain" [...] segment, Pinky asks, [...] "Gee, Brain, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do tonight?" [...] Brain replies, [...] "The same thing we do every night, Pinky: try to take over the world!" [...] During these episodes, Brain often asks Pinky, [...] "Are you pondering what I'm pondering?" [...] and Pinky replies with a silly non sequitur. Writer Peter Hastings said that he unintentionally created these catchphrases when he wrote the episode [...] "Win Big," [...] and then Producer Sherri Stoner used them and had them put into later episodes.|$|E

500|$|Originally {{published}} by Fantasy Games Unlimited in 1976, {{only two years}} after the first role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons was published, this edition is now long out of print. The game was inspired by Richard Adams' fantasy novel Watership Down, and the players were given the opportunity to take on the role of rabbits. As such, the game emphasized role-playing over combat for, according to Steffan O'Sullivan, [...] "You're playing a rabbit, after all – how much combat <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do?" [...] David M. Ewalt, in his book Of Dice and Men, commented that Bunnies & Burrows [...] "pushed setting even farther" [...] than other early RPGs like Dungeons & Dragons and En Garde!, as the [...] "player characters were intelligent rabbits and had to compete for food, avoid predators, and deal with internal warren politics". The poor production values provided a barrier to the acceptance of the game. The art, by Charles Loving, was [...] "sketchy and of poor quality", while the document as a whole gave the appearance of having been typewritten.|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} for the {{extended}} remix of [...] "Video Phone" [...] {{was directed by}} Hype Williams, along with producer Cisco Newman and art director Lenny Tso. On October 15, 2009, a spokesperson for Williams confirmed to MTV, that reports of Gaga and Beyoncé working on the music video together were true. It was shot at Brooklyn's Greenpoint neighborhood, under tight security. The artists were reported to be wearing fashionable dresses, with Knowles in [...] "a feathered dress" [...] and Gaga sporting [...] "something wild". In an interview with New York's Z100 radio station, Gaga further commented on her collaboration with Knowles, for the music video. She said, [...] "When I was doing her video with her, she called me and she said, 'What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do?' [...] And I'm like, 'I don't want {{to show up in}} some frickin' hair bow and be fashion Gaga in your video.' I said, 'I want to do you.' [...] I want to do my version of Beyoncé.

500|$|By May 1999, {{the group}} was nearing {{platinum}} status for Dude Ranch and sales targets were higher for Enema of the State. The Los Angeles Times ran a Sunday feature on the band two days prior to release, noting that [...] "The musicians are sanguine about chances to repeat or exceed the sales of Dude Ranch, noting the always-shifting sands of pop culture and that they've already done better than they'd ever anticipated." [...] Momentum began to build when US radio stations received advance copies of Enema of the State. MCA issued Enema of the State on June 1, and the release peaked at number nine on the U.S. Billboard 200. The album chart was gripped by the Backstreet Boys' Millennium, but Enema of the State still managed to move 109,000 units that week. The band was supporting Lagwagon in Europe when MCA executives phoned the trio about rising record sales. Joey Cape, frontman of Lagwagon, remarked that [...] "They were selling, like, 90,000 records a day [...] I was saying things like, 'What are you doing here? Go home! Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be on tour with Lagwagon right now?" [...] At a show shortly following {{the release of the}} album, DeLonge was approached by Noodles from The Offspring to congratulate him.

500|$|Kennedy {{finally decided}} to seek the Democratic {{nomination}} in the 1980 presidential election by launching an unusual, insurgent campaign against the incumbent Carter, {{a member of his}} own party. A midsummer 1978 poll had shown Democrats preferring Kennedy over Carter by a 5-to-3 margin. During spring and summer 1979, as Kennedy deliberated whether to run, Carter was not intimidated despite his 28percent approval rating, saying publicly: [...] "If Kennedy runs, I'll whip his ass." [...] Carter later asserted that Kennedy's constant criticism of his policies was a strong indicator that Kennedy was planning to run for the presidency. Labor unions urged Kennedy to run, as did some Democratic party officials who feared that Carter's unpopularity could result in heavy losses in the 1980 congressional elections. Kennedy decided to run in August 1979, when polls showed him with a 2-to-1 advantage over Carter; Carter's approval rating slipped to 19percent. Kennedy formally announced his campaign on November 7, 1979, at Boston's Faneuil Hall. He had already received substantial negative press from a rambling response to the question [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be President?" [...] during an interview with Roger Mudd of CBS News broadcast a few days earlier. The Iranian hostage crisis, which began on November 4, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, which began on December 27, prompted the electorate to rally around the president and allowed Carter to pursue a Rose Garden strategy of staying at the White House, which kept Kennedy's campaign out of the headlines.|$|E
500|$|A Kryptonian {{general and}} {{megalomaniac}} {{with the same}} superpowers as Superman, bent on transforming Earth into a new Krypton under his reign. Viggo Mortensen was considered for the role. Snyder stated, [...] "Zod is not only one of Superman's most formidable enemies, {{but one of the}} most significant because he has insights into Superman that others don't. Michael is a powerful actor who can project both the intelligence and the malice of the character, making him perfect for the role." [...] When Goyer was asked about why Zod was chosen as the villain, he stated, [...] "The way (Christopher) Nolan and I have always approached movies as well is you never say, 'Hey, which villain would be cool for this movie?' You start with the story first. What kind of story? What kind of theme <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> tell? So we worked that out. Then, usually the villain becomes obvious in terms of who's going to be the appropriate antagonist for that. When you guys see the movie, the only villain we could've used was Zod and the Kryptonians. I mean, when you see what the whole story is, nothing else would have even made sense." [...] Shannon also commented on his portrayal in comparison to Terence Stamp's original take on Zod, [...] "To follow Terence Stamp's iconic performance in the original, it is daunting, but I just focused on one day at a time. It's interesting that when we started with this, we did a lot of training together and I think that kind of helped loosen things up a little bit. It is a very physical movie at the end of the day. That's a good way to find your way 'into it' [...]" ...|$|E
