50|$|In 1782 {{it passed}} as a dowry to the von Krüdener family, {{and for some}} time Barbara von Krüdener was {{the lady of the}} manor. In 1842, it was sold to Carl von Jürgensonn, and in 1856 to Count Gustav Igelstrom. Already in 1857, it was sold again, to Arthur von Riechter, and in 1860 to Gustav Samson von Himmelstierna. The last aristocratic owner was Arthur von Wulf, who {{acquired}} the estate in 1902. Following the Estonian <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Independence, the <b>estate</b> was taken over by the Estonian state. Today, the main building of the manor houses a school.|$|R
5|$|The {{work of the}} Great Sejm did not {{end with}} the passing of the Constitution. The Sejm {{continued}} to debate and pass legislation building on and clarifying that document. Among the most notable acts passed after the 3 May was the Deklaracja Stanów Zgromadzonych (<b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> the Assembled <b>Estates)</b> <b>of</b> May 5, 1791, confirming the Government Act adopted two days earlier, and the Zaręczenie Wzajemne Obojga Narodów (Reciprocal Guarantee of Two Nations, i.e., of the Crown of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania) of October 22, 1791, affirming the unity and indivisibility of Poland and the Grand Duchy within a single state, and their equal representation in state-governing bodies. The Mutual Declaration strengthened the Polish-Lithuanian union, while keeping many federal aspects of the state intact.|$|R
50|$|The 1530 Imperial Diet of Augsburg was {{requested}} by Emperor Charles V {{to decide on}} three issues: first, {{the defense of the}} Empire against the Ottoman threat; second, issues related to policy, currency and public well being; and, third, disagreements about Christianity, in attempt to reach some compromise and a chance to deal with the German situation. The climate during this time was vastly different from what we see today when the Lutheran church moved to reformation at the assembly of Augsburg. The Diet was inaugurated by the emperor on June 20. It produced numerous outcomes, most notably the 1530 <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> the Lutheran <b>estates</b> known as the Augsburg Confession (Confessio Augustana), a central document of Lutheranism that was presented to the emperor.|$|R
5000|$|The {{long-term}} {{political objectives}} of the royal couple and their closest advisors remain unclear. A detailed document entitled Declaration to the French People prepared by Louis for presentation to the National Assembly and {{left behind in the}} Tuileries indicates that his personal goal was a return to the concessions and compromises contained in the <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> the Third <b>Estate</b> on 23 June 1789, immediately prior to the outbreak of violence in Paris and the storming of the Bastille. Private correspondence from Marie Antoinette takes a more reactionary line looking to a restoration of the old monarchy without concessions; though referring to pardons for all but the revolutionary leadership and the city of Paris [...] "if it does not return to its old order".|$|R
5|$|To further {{enhance the}} Commonwealth's {{integration}} and security, the constitution abolished the erstwhile union of Poland and Lithuania {{in favor of}} a unitary state. Its full establishment, supported by Stanisław August and Kołlątaj, was opposed by many Lithuanian deputies. As a compromise, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania received numerous privileges guaranteeing its continued existence. Related acts included the Deklaracja Stanów Zgromadzonych (<b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> the Assembled <b>Estates)</b> <b>of</b> May 5, 1791, confirming the Government Act adopted two days earlier, and the Zaręczenie Wzajemne Obojga Narodów (Reciprocal Guarantee of Two Nations, i.e., of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania) of October 22, 1791, affirming the unity and indivisibility of Poland and the Grand Duchy within a single state and their equal representation in state-governing bodies. The Reciprocal Guarantee strengthened the Polish–Lithuanian union while keeping many federal aspects of the state intact.|$|R
50|$|De la Warr {{remained}} in Jamestown as Governor, while Gates returned to England (and Somers to Bermuda), arriving in September, 1610. The {{news of the}} survival of the Sea Venture's passengers and crew caused a great sensation in England. Two accounts were published: Sylvester Jordain's A Discovery of the Barmvdas, Otherwise Called the Ile of Divels, in October, 1610, and A True <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Estate</b> <b>of</b> the Colonie in Virginia a month later. The True Reportory of the Wrack, and Redemption of Sir Thomas Gates Knight, an account by William Strachey dated 15 July 1610, returned to England with Gates {{in the form of a}} letter which was circulated privately until its eventual publication in 1625. Shakespeare had multiple contacts to the circle of people amongst whom the letter circled, including to Strachey. The Tempest shows clear evidence that he had read and relied on Jordain and especially Stratchey. The play shares premise, basic plot, and many details of the Sea Venture's wrecking and the adventures of the survivors, as well as specific details and linguistics. A detailed comparative analysis shows the Declaration to have been the primary source from which the play was drawn. This firmly dates the writing of the play to the months between Gates' return to England and the 1st of November, 1611.|$|R
40|$|Administration <b>of</b> the <b>estate</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the most}} {{important}} activities in insolvency proceedings, when debtor's insolvency is resoluted by bankruptcy. Everyone can see information about the administration's results in Insolvency Register. The procedure of it is not well known nonetheless. The goal of the thesis is to enlighten the procedure of administration <b>of</b> the <b>estate</b> (including defining its content) since <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> debtor's insolvency, when the authorization to dispose <b>of</b> the <b>estate</b> is held by insolvency administrator and to point out some relatively new legislative changes and its problems. Diploma thesis is divided into eight chapters, where there is gradual analysis of administration <b>of</b> the <b>estate</b> from the beginnings of insolvency proceedings and <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> bankruptcy to realization <b>of</b> the <b>estate</b> and canceling the bankruptcy. The first chapter brings short review of historic legislation and tries to point out some similarities of roman bankruptcy law and present legislation. The second chapter describes initiation <b>of</b> insolvency proceedings, <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> debtor's insolvency and it defines insolvency administrator and {{the way of his}} election by insolvency court.

50|$|The area was, {{in large}} part, the <b>estate</b> <b>of</b> Francis Lewis, a {{delegate}} to the Continental Congress and a signer <b>of</b> the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Independence. The <b>estate</b> {{was the site of}} an English raid during the Revolutionary War. Lewis was not present but his wife was taken prisoner and his house was burned to the ground. For a period of time Whitestone was called Clintonville after Dewitt Clinton, the former governor of New York; this etymology is present in the name of Cliftonville Street, located in the neighborhood. In the late 19th century, many wealthy New Yorkers began building mansions in the area, on what had once been farmland or woodland. Rapid development of the area ensued in the 1920s, however, as trolley and Long Island Rail Road train service on the Whitestone Branch was expanded into the neighborhood. Although this rail service ended during the Great Depression, part of the right-of-way was later used by Robert Moses to help construct the Belt Parkway, which includes the Whitestone Expressway which runs along the southeast edge of the former Flushing Airport and through Whitestone. Flushing Airport has been abandoned since 1985.|$|R
50|$|From 1644 to {{the early}} 20th century, {{the land of the}} {{neighborhood}} was the <b>estate</b> <b>of</b> the Morris family in Westchester County. In 1790, Lewis Morris, owner <b>of</b> the <b>estate</b> and signer <b>of</b> the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Independence, proposed the land as the site of the federal capital.|$|R
50|$|Törngren {{took part}} in a Finnish {{industrial}} development planning committee, installed by the Senate of Finland in summer 1856. In 1862 Törngren became selected to so-called January Committee by Nobility. During Diet of Finland 1863-1864, he represented his family as member <b>of</b> <b>Estate</b> <b>of</b> Nobles. He had liberal views, and he supported development of railway network. Törngren initiated installing Supreme Court; his proposal was approved, but implemented much later, after the Finnish <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Independence.|$|R

50|$|After the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Independence a SR-government {{was formed}} (the Council of People's Ministers) headed by Vsevolod Holubovych. On January 18, 1918 under the {{influence}} of the Left-wing of the Party headed by O.Shumsky the Central Rada finally accepted a provisional decree about the socialization <b>of</b> <b>estates.</b> However, on January 26, 1918 Kiev was taken by the army of Mikhail Muravyov and the members of the Rada relocated to Zhytomyr.|$|R
50|$|Maximilien de Robespierre, a French {{lawyer and}} {{politician}} from Arras {{and one of}} the best-known and most influential figures of the French Revolution, was elected fifth deputy <b>of</b> the third <b>estate</b> <b>of</b> Artois to the Estates-General in 1789.

50|$|In February 1658 knighted by Henry Cromwell, Lord Deputy of Ireland (this honour {{passed into}} {{oblivion}} with the Restoration in May 1660).

They set up a Council of Officers assumed the government of Ireland, and summon a Cconvention <b>of</b> <b>Estates</b> (or Convention Parliament). The Convention accepted Charles's <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Breda and proclaimed him King of Ireland.|$|R
50|$|Evidence: {{the date}} of The Tempest can be {{securely}} fixed between September 1610 and October 1611. Obviously, to have been on stage on 1 November, {{it must have been}} completed before November, and {{it is unlikely that the}} Whitehall performance was the first performance (plays were rarely performed at court without previously appearing on the public stage). The terminus post quem of September 1610 can be fixed by Shakespeare's use of a real incident as source material. In May 1609 a fleet of nine ships set sail from Plymouth, heading for Virginia, carrying five hundred colonists. On 29 July, the flagship, the Sea Venture, was driven off course by a storm and wrecked on the coast of Bermuda. All hands were thought lost, but on 23 May 1610 her passengers arrived safely in Virginia, having found shelter on Bermuda, where they repaired the pinnaces and completed their journey. The play is particularly indebted to William Strachey's A True Reportory of the Wracke and Redemption of Sir Thomas Gates, written in Virginia, and dated 15 July. The MS was carried back to England by Gates himself, who arrived in London in early September. Although True Reportory was not published until 1625, it is known to have been read widely in MS form. Two pamphlets published later in 1610 were also used as sources; Sylvester Jourdain's A Discovery of the Bermudas, the dedication of which is dated 13 October 1610, and the Virginia Company's own A True <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Estate</b> <b>of</b> the Colonie in Virginia, which was entered into the Stationers Register on 8 November. It is worth noting that although most scholars accept these texts as sources and evidence of dating, not all do so. Kenneth Muir is a notable example of a scholar who questions the argument that Shakespeare used Strachey. Stylistically, a rare vocabulary test, a colloquialism-in-verse test and Ants Oras' pause test all place the play after Coriolanus, Winter's Tale and Cymbeline.|$|R

The <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Sentiments, much like the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> the Rights of Woman was written in the style <b>of</b> the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> the Rights of Man, was written in the style <b>of</b> the <b>Declaration</b> <b>of</b> Independence of the United States.|$|R
