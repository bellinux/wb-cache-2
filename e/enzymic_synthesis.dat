40|$|Squalene and sterol {{carrier protein}} of liver plays a general {{role as a}} vehicle for {{cholesterol}} and its water-insoluble precursors; the carrier protein is essential for <b>enzymic</b> cholesterol <b>synthesis.</b> Liver microsomal enzymes contain a small amount of endogenous carrier protein, which is readily removed by washing or purification of the enzyme. Enzymic conversion to products of a cholesterol precursor·carrier protein complex is markedly faster than that for initially unbound sterol. The protomer form of the carrier protein has a molecular weight of 16, 000; during sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis one band is observed. Phospholipid facilitates the aggregation of the protomer to the oligomer form (> 150, 000 daltons; purified 720 -fold) accompanied by the binding of cholesterol precursors to the oligomer. The carrier protein binds fatty acids as well as cholesterol precursors, suggesting that it may more generally be a lipid carrier protein with “squalene and sterol carrier protein” describing the functional aspects of the lipid carrier in cholesterol biosynthesis. Studies with several steroids and related compounds revealed that the binding sites of lipid carrier protein must contain highly specific hydrophobic and polar regions...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{efficient}} synthetic glycosylation method {{suitable for use}} in solid-phase <b>enzymic</b> oligosaccharide <b>synthesis</b> and site-specific glycosylation of recombinant proteins to produce defined glycoforms is described. This strategy utilizes N-(beta-saccharide) haloacetamides for attaching oligosaccharides specifically to cysteine residues of proteins in solution to form neoglycoproteins. The alkylation reaction was tested using N-(beta-chitotriose) bromoacetamide and an unprotected synthetic hexapeptide containing a single cysteine residue. The glycosylated product was confirmed by amino acid and hexosamine analyses as well as laser desorption mass spectrometry. Similarly N-(beta-chitotriose) iodoacetamide was covalently linked to non-reduced BSA to produce a defined glycoform of this protein. The specific attachment of chitotriose at the single cysteine residue in non-reduced serum albumin was suggested by Ellman's assay for free thiols. This was verified by amino acid sequencing of tryptic glycopeptide derived from this neoglycoprotein. Multiple sugar attachment was accomplished using fully reduced serum albumin {{as demonstrated by the}} formation of two neoglycoproteins using iodoacetamide derivatives of galactose beta 1 - 3 -N-acetylgalactosamine (Gal beta 1 - 3 GalNAc) and the major xylose/fucose-class plant-type oligosaccharide of horseradish peroxidase. These two neoglycoproteins with an average of 18 - 21 sugar residues attached were assayed positively for binding to peanut agglutinin and a sugar-specific anti-(horseradish peroxidase) monoclonal antibody YZ 1 / 2. 23 respectively. Sialylation of the neoglycoprotein containing Gal beta 1 - 3 GalNAc was accomplished using alpha- 2, 3 -sialyltransferase and radiolabelled CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid. Significantly, glycan attachment using this conjugation method is reversible as demonstrated by the release of oligosaccharides from these two neoglycoproteins using hydrazinolysis. Therefore this method could provide invaluable reagents for many glycobiological studies...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that D-xylose {{partially}} overcomes the puromycin inhibition of chondroitin sulfate synthesis in cultured chick embryo chondrocytes. Likewise, D-xylose stimulates chondroitin sulfate synthesis by limb bud mesenchyme cells previously treated with BrdU or limb bud cartilage cells treated with puromycin. The studies reported here show that p-nitrophenyl-β-D-xylopyranoside and 4 -methyl-umbelliferyl-β-D-xylopyranoside cause a much greater stimulation than does D-xylose and are active at much lower concentrations. In contrast to D-xylose, the xylosides strikingly stimulate chondroitin sulfate synthesis in predifferentiated mesenchyme cells. The xylosides stimulate synthesis of chondroitin sulfate by rat glial cell tumor cells (RC- 6), a mouse neuroblastoma (C 1300, NB 41 A), and two strains of cultured rat hepatoma cells (HTC, H 4). These results indicate that certain types of nonconnective tissue cells contain the <b>enzymic</b> machinery for <b>synthesis</b> of chondroitin sulfate which is normally not utilized because of limited synthesis of core protein and/or xylosyltransferase.

Glycerate- 3 -phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate and fructose- 1, 6 -diphosphate did not stimulate ADP-glucose formation by a pyrophosphorylation reaction. The major metabolic pathway for UDP-glucose utilization {{appears to be the}} synthesis of either sucrose or sucrose-P. On the other hand, a specific precursor role of ADP-glucose for synthesizing chloroplast starch by the ADP-glucose-starch transglucosylase reaction is supported by the coupled enzyme system of ADP-glucose-pyrophosphorylase and transglucosylase, isolated from chloroplasts.

40|$|Mutant staphylococci with {{impaired}} respiration, {{induced by}} ultraviolet radiation, {{were used for}} testing various inhibitors with already known mechanisms of action. Inhibitors of protein synthesis (the tetracyclins) affected the growth of parent and mutant cultures to the same degree. To the inhibitors of cell-wall synthesis (the penicillins) mutant staphy-lococci were more resistant than the parents; this {{was related to the}} altered amino acid composition of cell-wall material in the mutants. On the other hand, the mutants were much more vulnerable than parents to the action of inhibitors which affected the nucleic acids-namely, mitomycin C (x 50 times), actinomycin C (x SO), trypaflavine (x 300), nitrogen mustards (x 10 - 20). A specific thymine synthetase inhibitor (5 -fluorodeoxyuridine) strongly inhibited the growth of parent staphylococci, but did not at all inhibit the growth of mutants, This points to some deficiency in the <b>enzymic</b> mechanism of <b>synthesis</b> of thymine in the DNA of mutants.

40|$|The {{customary}} {{route in}} animals and bacteria for delta-aminolevulinic acid biosynthesis is from glycine and succinyl CoA, catalyzed by the enzyme delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase [succinyl-CoA:glycine C-succinyltransferase (decarboxylating), EC 2. 3. 1. 37]. Attempts to demonstrate this route in {{plants have been}} unsuccessful. Evidence is given for a new <b>enzymic</b> route of <b>synthesis</b> of delta-aminolevulinic acid in plants. This route involves the incorporation of the intact five-carbon skeleton of glutamic acid into delta-aminolevulinic acid. Demonstration of the new pathway in plants has been made by feeding specifically labeled [14 C]glutamic acid to etiolated barley shoots greening in the light. In the presence of levulinate, a competitive inhibitor of delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydrastase [porphobilinogen synthase; delta-aminolevulinate hydro-lyase (adding delta-aminolevulinate and cyclizing); EC 4. 2. 1. 24], delta-aminolevulinate accumulates. The delta-aminolevulinate formed was chemically degraded by periodate to formaldehyde and succinic acid. The C 5 (formaldehyde) fragment was separated, as the 5, 5 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -cyclohexanedione (dimedone) derivative, from the C 1 -C 4 (succinic acid) fragment. The C 5 atom contained radioactivity predominantly derived from C 1 of glutamic acid. Conversely, the labeled C 3 and C 4 atoms of glutamic acid were found primarily in the succinic acid (C 1 -C 4) fragment of delta-aminolevulinate. This labeling pattern for delta-aminolevulinic acid {{is consistent with a}} biosynthetic route utilizing the intact five-carbon skeleton of alpha-ketoglutarate, glutamate, or glutamine, and is inconsistent with the delta-aminolevulinic acid synthetase pathway utilizing glycine and succinyl CoA as precursors...|$|R
40|$|Many {{biological}} processes depend on cell surface recognition of receptor-ligand pairs. Some receptors, {{such as the}} selectins, recognize specific carbohydrate structures {{as part of their}} ligands. The ability to synthesize such ligands for use in the study of cell adhesion mechanisms or as inhibitors of a variety of pathological conditions would be extremely useful. However, the chemical or <b>enzymic</b> in vitro <b>synthesis</b> of carbohydrate-based ligands has thus far been difficult and costly. We have used E-selectin and its carbohydrate ligand as a model system to test if it is possible to express specific carbohydrate structures on a secreted, glycosylated and easily purified scaffold protein and to use this newly modified protein as a functional adhesion molecule. We co-expressed a fucosyltransferase (ELFT) and a secreted immunoglobulin-LFA 3 fusion protein (LFA 31 G) in the same cell to modify the carbohydrate structures on the secreted LFA 3 IG scaffold protein (we refer to this novel protein as X-LFA 3 IG). Using glycosidase digestion, lectin binding, carbohydrate composition analysis and antibody-binding assays, we show that approximately 50 % of the potential N-linked carbohydrate sites on X-LFA 3 IG are, indeed, modified and that the modification is the addition of fucose. Furthermore, we show that X-LFA 3 IG contains epitopes recognized by anti-Slex antibodies, and, using an E-selectin-specific adhesion assay, we demonstrate that X-LFA 3 IG is a functional ligand for E-selectin. This in vivo approach for generating specific carbohydrate structures could be generalized to produce and purify large quantities of other biologically important carbohydrate structures...|$|R

40|$|When amylose was {{synthesized}} using potato phosphorylase in {{the presence}} of amylose complexing lipids, monodisperse populations of amylose-lipid complexes were formed. Enzyme dosage and glucose- 1 -phosphate (glc- 1 -P) /primer ratio influenced the reaction rate of the <b>enzymic</b> <b>synthesis,</b> presumably by changing the balance between amylose synthesis and amylose-lipid complexation and precipitation, and impacted the molecular weight of the complexes. Lipid characteristics affected the dissociation properties and amylose chain lengths of the amylose-lipid complexes presumably by determining the minimal amylose chain length necessary for complexation and precipitation. Tailor made short chain amylose-lipid complexes can hence be produced by choosing the appropriate reaction conditions. We propose a synthesis mechanism in which the primer is elongated until an amylose chain is obtained which is of sufficient length to complex a first lipid. Further chain extension then occurs, together with subsequent complexation until the complex becomes insoluble and precipitates. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E

In mouse L- 929 cells at 5 h after infection at a multiplicity of 2 oo p. f. u. /cell, there was a decrease in DNA synthesis. However, the rate of DNA replication fork movement, measured by equilibrium sedimentation of DNA sequentially abelled with BrdUrd and 3 H-thymidine, was not significantly reduced in infected cells despite an 84 % inhibition of DNA <b>synthesis.</b> <b>Enzymic</b> assay of the total cellular dTTP pool size showed it to be increased 37 % in infected cells compared to controls. This was not accounted for by enhanced entry of thymidine nucleotides into the pool from either exogenous or endogenous sources, since the buoyant density of DNA pulse-labelled with aH-BrdUrd was the same in infected and uninfected cells {{and there was no}} evidence for breakdown of DNA in infected cells. There was also a moderate decrease in the uptake of exogenous thymidine into the cell, shown by a reduction in the Vin~. ~ for transport with little change in the Kin. By 6 h after infection, the dTTP pool size was slightly smaller in infected cells than in the controls and there was a marked inhibition in the rate of replica-tion fork movement. These results how that Mengovirus infection blocks the entry of dTTP into DNA. At 5 h after infection, this block is manifested by an inhibition of initiation of new DNA chain synthesis. By 6 h, replication fork movement is also retarded and there is a more generalized erangement in DNA synthesis...|$|R
40|$|Two {{distinct}} biosynthetic {{pathways to}} the {{essential amino acid}} L-lysine (A) are found in nature. The -aminoadipate pathway operates in fungi and yeasts. The diaminopimelate (DAP) pathway occurs in bacteria and higher plants. Our studies were concerned with the DAP pathway and particularly with the first two steps of this pathway. These steps involve condensation of L-aspartate [...] semialdehyde (ASA) (B) with pyruvate (C) to form L- 2, 3 -dihydrodipicolinic acid (DHDPS) (D) and subsequent reduction to L- 2, 3, 4, 5 -tetrahydrodipicolinic acid (THDPA) (E). The first step is catalysed by the enzyme dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS). The second step is catalysed by the enzyme dihydrodipicolinate reductase (DHDPR) and utilises NADPH as a co-factor. (Fig 6269 A) Our primary objective was the inhibition of this biosynthetic pathway. Inhibitors of this pathway have potential as antibacterial or herbicidal agents. A number of substrate analogues of the DHDPS and DHDPR enzymes were prepared and tested as inhibitors of these enzymes. In previous studies by our group, heterocyclic compound (F) showed promising activity. In our work, a number of analogues of compound (F) were prepared. Inhibition studies with these compounds constituted a valuable insight into the characteristics of these enzymes. The level of inhibition with these compounds and {{for a range of}} other substrate analogues indicate high substrate selectivity for the enzymes. (Fig 6269 B) The condensation catalysed by DHDPS is mechanistically interesting. In chemical terms, C-C bond formation is commonly a high energy process involving highly reactive compounds such as organometallic agents or strong bases. In such cases the strategy must be directed towards protecting other functionality or introducing it at a later stage. Clearly, achieving this task under mild conditions with the high regio- and stereoselectivity associated with enzymic catalysis could be of tremendous advantage. Once again, however, we were restricted by the high substrate specificity of the DHDPS enzyme. In earlier studies by our group, Dr J. E. McKendrick found evidence of substrate activity for 2 - and 3 -methyl substituted ASA, (G) and (H), respectively. In our work, an improved preparation of these compounds was developed and the subsequent biotransformations with DHDPS were examined both qualitatively and quantitatively. Interestingly, compound (G) was shown to display a greater substrate activity than ASA. The preparation of ASA methyl ester (I) was achieved. This compound also displayed a moderate level of substrate activity and was the only compound found to show substrate activity for a DHDPS/DHDPR coupled substrate assay. (Fig 6269 C) A significant proportion of our effort was concentrated on the investigation of glutamate [...] semialdehyde (GSA) (J), the higher homologue of ASA, as a substrate of DHDPS. Problems were encountered with earlier studies in this area because of cyclisation of GSA, even in protected forms. To counter this problem two novel strategies were considered. The first involved in situ enzymic deprotection of the N-acetyl derivative of GSA. Although this was successful for N-Acetyl-ASA, problems with cyclisation were once again experienced for the GSA equivalent. The second strategy utilises the reversible nature of <b>enzymic</b> catalysis. The <b>synthesis</b> of the proposed 7 -membered heterocyclic product (K) of DHDPS catalysed condensation of GSA and pyruvate is not a trivial task. Some progress was made and further direction detailed. Further validation for this study was demonstrated on preparation of 5 -hydroxyproline (L). Compound (L) is a cyclic equivalent of GSA and was found to display clear evidence of substrate activity. (Fig 6269 D...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} enigmatic results of studies on the <b>enzymic</b> <b>synthesis</b> of DNA is that the {{polymerase}} is consistently found in homogenate fractions generally designated as cytoplasmic 0 - 4). Since an unequivocal {{answer to the question}} of intracellular location of the enzyme seemed quite impossible from homogenate studies, we have taken a direct cytological approach to the problem. The experiment consists simply in introducing exogenous DNA 1 into living cells by means of pinocytosis in H 3 -thymidine medium. In the presence of the required enzymes (thymidine kinase, thymidylate kinase, and DNA polymerase) and the other substrates required for DNA synthesis, the ingested DNA serves as a primer for DNA synthesis. The site of DNA synthesis is determined by autoradiographic detection of H 3 -thymidine incorporated into DNase-sensitive material.

40|$|The <b>enzymic</b> <b>synthesis,</b> transfer, and {{utilization}} of glycolyl-CoA (i. e. 2 -hydroxyacetyl-CoA) {{have been studied}} in rat and mouse livers. On the one hand, these tissues contain the enzyme activities allowing the synthesis of glycolyl-CoA from fatty acids (palmitate omega-hydroxylase, omega-hydroxypalmitoyl-CoA synthetase, and mitochondrial beta-oxidation of omega-hydroxypalmitoyl-CoA) and 3 -hydroxypyruvic acid (oxidation by intact mitochondria). On the other hand, three types of glycolyltransferase activities can be demonstrated in rodent livers, depending on either carnitine, glucosamine, or glucosamine- 6 -phosphate. The subcellular distributions of these glycolyltransferase activities {{are similar to those}} of the corresponding acetyltransferase counterparts. Concerning carnitine glycolyltransferase, the activity is widely distributed in the subcellular fractions, pointing out its occurrence in most cell compartments. By contrast, the glucosamine and glucosamine- 6 -phosphate glycolyltransferase activities were located preferentially in the microsomal fraction. The condensation between glycolyl-CoA and glucosamine (or glucosamine- 6 -phosphate) raises the interesting question of the nature and the role of the resulting glycolylglucosamine molecule, especially in an alternative N-glycolylneuraminic acid synthesis pathway...|$|E

The stimulation was stereospecific, dose-dependent, and inhibited by the beta-adrenergic agonist propranolol. The addition of GTP inside the resealed ghosts shifted the dose-response of phospholipid methylation by L-isoproterenol {{to the left}} by 2 orders of magnitude. Direct stimulation of adenylate cyclase [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4. 6. 1. 1] with sodium fluoride or cholera toxin did not increase the methylation of phospholipids. At a concentration of S-adenosyl-L-methionine that stimulates synthesis of phosphatidyl-N-monomethylethanolamine, the activity of isoproterenol-sensitive adenylate cyclase was increased 2 -fold without changes in the basal activity of adenylate cyclase {{and the number of}} beta-adrenergic receptors. The increase of phospholipid methylation by L-isoproterenol decreased membrane viscosity and increased translocation of methylated lipids. These findings indicate that enhancement of phospholipid methylation by L-isoproterenol decreases membrane microviscosity and thus increases lateral movement of the beta-adrenergic receptors and coupling with adenylate cyclase...|$|E
40|$|The {{inhibitory}} {{action of}} chlorpromazine on skeletal muscle {{has been studied}} with isolated preparations. In the nerve-muscle preparations of the frog sartorius and the rat diaphragm, the twitch responses to indirect stimulation are much more strongly depressed by chlorpromazine than those to direct stimulation. The conductivity of the nerve trunk is unaffected. The contractures of the frog rectus abdominis muscle caused by acetylcholine are depressed by chlorpromazine,but the contractures due to KCl are not influenced. Larger doses of chlorpromazine cause contracture by themselves, and this cannot be prevented by tubocurarine. In the sartorius muscle of the toad, the depolarization due to acetylcholine is reduced by chlorpromazine. The paralysing action of chlorpromazine adds to that of tubocurarine, and is antagonized to some extent by eserine or neostigmine. Muscles treated with chlorpromazine do not completely recover on washing. High concentrations of chlorpromazine depress the release of acetylcholine by motor-nerve stimulation, although they do not affect the <b>enzymic</b> <b>synthesis</b> of acetylcholine by acetone-dried powder of guinea-pig brain.

Cycloheximide or actinomycin D administered at the time of oestradiol injection completely blocked the increase in enzyme activity. The enzyme involved in spermine synthesis, S-adenosyl-l-methionine decarboxylase, with S-adenosyl-l-methionine and spermidine as required substrates, was partially purified on Sephadex and DEAE-cellulose columns. The decarboxylation of S-adenosyl-l-methionine could not be separated from the transfer of a propylamine moiety from the decarboxylated S-adenosyl-l-methionine to spermidine to form spermine. We were unable also to separate this system from the enzyme that formed spermidine when S-adenosyl-l-methionine and putrescine are used as substrates. Spermidine-stimulated S-adenosyl-l-methionine decarboxylase has an apparent half-life of 60 min, identical with the half-life reported for putrescine-stimulated S-adenosyl-l-methionine decarboxylase.

We rationalized that simple <b>enzymic</b> <b>synthesis</b> of inositol hexakisphosphate labeled with 32 P would greatly enable study of transformation of soil inositol phosphates when combined with robust HPLC separations of different inositol phosphates. Methods We employed the enzyme inositol pentakisphosphate 2 -kinase, IP 5 2 -K, to transfer phosphate from [γ- 32 P]ATP to axial hydroxyl(s) of myo-, neo- and 1 Dchiro-inositol phosphate substrates. Results 32 P-labeled inositol phosphates were separated by anion exchange HPLC with phosphate eluents. Additional HPLC methods were developed to allow facile separation of myo-, neo-, 1 D-chiro- and scyllo-inositol hexakisphosphate on acid gradients. Conclusions We developed enzymic approaches that allow the synthesis of labeled myoinositol 1,[[32 P] 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -hexakisphosphate; neo-inositol 1,[32 P] 2, 3, 4,[32 P] 5, 6 – hexakisphosphate and 1 D-chiro-inositol [32 P] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,[32 P] 6 -hexakisphosphate. Additionally, we describe HPLC separations of all inositol hexakisphosphates yet identified in soils, using a collection of soil inositol phosphates described in the seminal historic studies of Cosgrove, Tate and coworkers. Our study will enable others to perform radiotracer experiments to analyze fluxes of phosphate to/from inositol hexakisphosphates in different soils...|$|E
40|$|L-delta-(alpha-Aminoadipoyl) -L-cysteinyl-D-valine (ACV) {{synthetase}} {{is probably}} the simplest known peptide synthetase {{in terms of the}} number of reactions catalyzed. In the "thiol-template" proposal for nonribosomal peptide synthesis, a key step is transfer of aminoacyl groups derived from the substrates to enzyme-bound thiols prior to peptide bond formation. No incorporation of 18 O was seen in AMP isolated from the reaction mixture when di[18 O]valine was incubated with relatively large amounts of active synthetase and MgATP. We therefore utilized di[18 O]valine as a substrate for the biosynthesis of the diastereomeric dipeptides L-O-(methylserinyl) -L-valine and L-O-(methylserinyl) -D-valine [Shiau, C. -Y., Baldwin, J. E., Byford, M. F., Sobey, W. J., and Schofield, C. J. (1995) FEBS Lett. 358, 97 - 100]. In the L-O-(methylserinyl) -L-valine product, no significant loss of 18 O was observed. However, in the L-O-(methylserinyl) -D-valine product, a significant loss of one or both 18 O labels was observed. Thus, both peptide bond formation and the epimerization of the valine residue can both occur before formation of any thioester bond to the valine carboxylate in the biosynthesis of these dipeptides. The usual qualitative test for thioesterification of substrates to the synthetase, lability of enzyme-bound radiolabeled amino acid to performic acid, proved inconclusive in our hands. These results require a new mechanism for the <b>enzymic</b> <b>synthesis</b> of L-O-(methylserinyl) -L-valine and L-O-(methylserinyl) -D-valine and imply that a revised mechanism for ACV synthesis is also required...|$|E
40|$|Steady-state kinetic {{studies of}} the enzymic glucosyl {{transfer}} to and from phosphate catalysed by cellobiose phosphorylase from Cellulomonas uda have shown that this enzyme operates by a ternary-complex kinetic mechanism in which beta-cellobiose binds before phosphate, and beta-D-glucose and alpha-D-glucopyranosyl phosphate are released in that order. alpha-D-Glucopyranosyl fluoride (but not beta-D-glucopyranosyl fluoride) serves as alternative glucosyl donor for beta-cellobiose synthesis with a specificity constant that is one-ninth that of the corresponding enzymic reaction with alpha-D-glucopyranosyl phosphate (approximately 20000 M(- 1). s(- 1) at 30 degrees C). The kinetic parameters for a complete series of deoxy and deoxyfluoro analogues of D-glucose have been determined and the data yield estimates of the net strengths of hydrogen-bonding interactions with the non-reacting hydroxy groups of D-glucose at the transition state (0. 8 - 4. 0 kcal/mol, where 1 cal identical with 4. 184 J) and enable the prediction of the polarities of these hydrogen bonds. Each hydroxy group functions as donor of a hydrogen for bonding to probably a charged (at 3 -OH) or neutral (at 2 -OH and 6 -OH) acceptor group on the enzyme. The equatorial 1 -OH is essential for enzyme activity. Derivatives of D-glucose in which the 1 -OH or the reacting 4 -OH were replaced by hydrogen or fluorine have been tested as inhibitors to measure their affinities for the sugar-binding subsite + 1 (numbered from the bond-cleaving/forming site). The data show that hydrogen-bonding interactions between the 1 -OH and 4 -OH and charged groups on the enzyme stabilize the ground-state ternary complex of the <b>enzymic</b> <b>synthesis</b> of beta-cellobiose by 2. 3 and 0. 4 kcal/mol, respectively, and assist the precise positioning of beta-D-glucose for catalysis...|$|E
40|$|Decaprenylphosphoryl-D-arabinose (DPA) {{has been}} shown to be the donor of the {{essential}} D-arabinofuranosyl residues found in the cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. DPA is formed from phosphoribose diphosphate in a four-step process. The first step is the nucleophilic replacement of the diphosphate group with decaprenyl phosphate. This reaction is catalysed by the integral membrane protein 5 -phospho-alpha-D-ribose- 1 -diphosphate: decaprenyl-phosphate 5 -phosphoribosyltransferase (DPPR synthase). The enzyme is essential for growth and thereby an important target candidate for the development of new tuberculosis drugs. Although membrane proteins are an important subset of targets for current antibacterial agents, details about the structures and the active sites of such proteins are often not readily available by X-ray crystallography. To begin a different approach to the issue, homologues from Mycobacterium smegmatis and Corynebacterium glutamicum were expressed in Escherichia coli and shown to be active DPPR synthases. This was followed by bioinformatic analyses of the aligned sequences and then by site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids identified as likely to be important for activity. The results suggested that the <b>enzymic</b> <b>synthesis</b> of decaprenyl-phosphate 5 -phosphoribose (DPPR) occurs on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. Amino acid substitutions showed that the predicted cytoplasmic N-terminal region and two cytoplasmic loops are involved in substrate binding and/or catalysis along with parts of some adjoining inner membrane regions. The enzyme lacks the classical phosphoribose diphosphate (pRpp) binding site found in nucleic acid precursor enzymes of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes but instead contains a conserved NDxxD motif required for enzymic activity. Thus, it is plausible that this DPPR synthase has a pRpp binding site that is different from that of the classical eukaryotic enzymes, and further work to develop inhibitors against this enzyme is thereby encouraged...|$|E
