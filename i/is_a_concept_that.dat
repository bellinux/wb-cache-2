5|$|However, {{justiciability}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> <b>that</b> eludes precise categorization or definition, {{and this}} has caused disquiet amongst some critics. The implication is {{that there may be}} some unfairness where questionable executive action remains unchallenged. Nonetheless, the concept of justiciability is useful in determining the likelihood of whether an executive action is within the purview of judicial review.|$|E

25|$|A {{wormhole}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> <b>that</b> {{represents a}} solution of the Einstein field equations: a non-trivial structure linking separate points in spacetime.

If this concept were to be built, not only would it have the world's highest inversion, but also the world's highest vertical launch.|$|E

500|$|Edward O Wilson has {{developed}} {{the idea of}} consilience to encourage coherence of global moral and scientific knowledge supporting the premise that [...] "only unified learning, universally shared, makes accurate foresight and wise choice possible". Thus, world conscience <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> <b>that</b> overlaps with the Gaia hypothesis in advocating a balance of moral, legal, scientific and economic solutions to modern transnational problems such as global poverty and climate change, through strategies such as environmental ethics, climate ethics, natural conservation, ecology, cosmopolitanism, sustainability and sustainable development, biosequestration and legal protection of the biosphere and biodiversity. The NGO 350.org, for example, seeks to attract world conscience to {{the problems associated with}} elevation in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.|$|E
500|$|The {{opening of}} East European orphanages {{in the early}} 1990s {{following}} the end of the Cold War provided substantial opportunities for research on attachment and other aspects of institutional rearing, however such research rarely mentions [...] "maternal deprivation" [...] other than in a historical context. Maternal deprivation as a discrete syndrome <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> <b>that</b> is rarely used other than in connection with extreme deprivation and failure to thrive. Rather there is consideration of a range of different lacks and deficiencies in different forms of care, or lack of care, of which attachment is only one aspect, as well as consideration of constitutional and genetic factors in determining developmental outcome. Subsequent studies have however confirmed Bowlby's concept of [...] "cycles of disadvantage" [...] although not all children from unhappy homes reproduce the deficiencies in their own experience. Rather, it is now conceptualised as a series of pathways through childhood and a number of varied influences will determine which path a particular child takes.|$|E

2500|$|... "Forms of Time {{and of the}} Chronotope in the Novel" [...] {{introduces}} Bakhtin’s {{concept of}} chronotope. This essay applies the concept {{in order to further}} demonstrate the distinctive quality of the novel. The word chronotope literally means [...] "time space" [...] (a concept he refers to that of Einstein) and is defined by Bakhtin as [...] "the intrinsic connectedness of temporal and spatial relationships that are artistically expressed in literature." [...] For the purpose of his writing, an author must create entire worlds and, in doing so, is forced {{to make use of the}} organizing categories of the real world in which he lives.

2500|$|In {{the context}} of wine production, terroir <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> <b>that</b> {{encompasses}} the varieties of grapes used, elevation {{and shape of the}} vineyard, type and chemistry of soil, climate and seasonal conditions, and the local yeast cultures. The range of possible combinations of these factors can result in great differences among wines, influencing the fermentation, finishing, and aging processes as well. Many wineries use growing and production methods that preserve or accentuate the aroma and taste influences of their unique terroir. However, flavor differences are less desirable for producers of mass-market table wine or other cheaper wines, where consistency takes precedence. Such producers try to minimize differences in sources of grapes through production techniques such as micro-oxygenation, tannin filtration, cross-flow filtration, thin-film evaporation, ...|$|E
2500|$|Female metrosexuality <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> <b>that</b> Simpson {{explored}} with American writer Caroline Hagood. [...] They {{employed the}} female characters from the HBO series Sex and the City {{in order to}} illustrate examples of wo-metrosexuality, a term Hagood coined {{to refer to the}} feminine form of metrosexuality. The piece implied that, although this phenomenon would not necessarily empower women, the fact that the metrosexual lifestyle de-emphasizes traditional male and female gender roles could help women out in the long run. However, it is debatable whether the characters made famous by [...] "Sex and the City" [...] truly de-emphasized female gender roles, given that the series focused a high amount of attention on stereotypically feminine interests like clothing, appearance, and romantic entanglements.|$|E
