40|$|Accurate {{detection}} of mitosis plays {{a critical role}} in breast cancer histopathology. Manual detection and counting of mitosis is tedious and subject to considerable inter- and <b>intra-reader</b> <b>variations.</b> Multispectral imaging is a recent medical imaging technology, proven successful in increasing the segmentation accuracy in other fields. This study aims at improving the accuracy of mitosis detection by developing a specific solution using multispectral and multifocal imaging of breast cancer histopathological data. We propose to enable clinical routine-compliant quality of mitosis discrimination from other objects. The proposed framework includes comprehensive analysis of spectral bands and z-stack focus planes, {{detection of}} expected mitotic regions (candidates) in selected focus planes and spectral bands, computation of multispectral spatial features for each candidate, selection of multispectral spatial features and a study of different state-of-the-art classification methods for candidates classification as mitotic or non mitotic figures. This framework has been evaluated on MITOS multispectral medical dataset and achieved 60 % detection rate and 57 % F-Measure. Our results indicate that multispectral spatial features have more information for mitosis classification in comparison with white spectral band features, being therefore a very promising exploration area {{to improve the quality of}} the diagnosis assistance in histopathology...|$|E
40|$|Context: According to Nottingham grading system, mitosis {{count in}} breast cancer {{histopathology}} {{is one of three}} components required for cancer grading and prognosis. Manual counting of mitosis is tedious and subject to considerable inter- and <b>intra-reader</b> <b>variations.</b> Aims: The aim is to investigate the various texture features and Hierarchical Model and X (HMAX) biologically inspired approach for mitosis detection using machine-learning techniques. Materials and Methods: We propose an approach that assists pathologists in automated mitosis detection and counting. The proposed method, which is based on the most favorable texture features combination, examines the separability between different channels of color space. Blue-ratio channel provides more discriminative information for mitosis detection in histopathological images. Co-occurrence features, run-length features, and Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) features were extracted and used in the classification of mitosis. Finally, a classification is performed to put the candidate patch either in the mitosis class or in the non-mitosis class. Three different classifiers have been evaluated: Decision tree, linear kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM), and non-linear kernel SVM. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed framework using the modified biologically inspired model of HMAX and compare the results with other feature extraction methods such as dense SIFT. Results: The proposed method has been tested on Mitosis detection {{in breast cancer}} histological images (MITOS) dataset provided for an International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2012 contest. The proposed framework achieved 76 % recall, 75 % precision and 76 % F-measure. Conclusions: Different frameworks for classification have been evaluated for mitosis detection. In future work, instead of regions, we intend to compute features on the results of mitosis contour segmentation and use them to improve detection and classification rate...|$|E
40|$|Context: According to Nottingham grading system, mitosis count plays a {{critical}} role in cancer diagnosis and grading. Manual counting of mitosis is tedious and subject to considerable inter- and <b>intra-reader</b> <b>variations.</b> Aims: The aim is to improve the accuracy of mitosis detection by selecting the color channels that better capture the statistical and morphological features, which classify mitosis from other objects. Materials and Methods: We propose a framework that includes comprehensive analysis of statistics and morphological features in selected channels of various color spaces that assist pathologists in mitosis detection. In candidate detection phase, we perform Laplacian of Gaussian, thresholding, morphology and active contour model on blue-ratio image to detect and segment candidates. In candidate classification phase, we extract a total of 143 features including morphological, first order and second order (texture) statistics features for each candidate in selected channels and finally classify using decision tree classifier. Results and Discussion: The proposed method has been evaluated on Mitosis Detection in Breast Cancer Histological Images (MITOS) dataset provided for an International Conference on Pattern Recognition 2012 contest and achieved 74 % and 71 % detection rate, 70 % and 56 % precision and 72 % and 63 % F-Measure on Aperio and Hamamatsu images, respectively. Conclusions and Future Work: The proposed multi-channel features computation scheme uses fixed image scale and extracts nuclei features in selected channels of various color spaces. This simple but robust model has proven to be highly efficient in capturing multi-channels statistical features for mitosis detection, during the MITOS international benchmark. Indeed, the mitosis detection of critical importance in cancer diagnosis is a very challenging visual task. In future work, we plan to use color deconvolution as preprocessing and Hough transform or local extrema based candidate detection {{in order to reduce the}} number of candidates in mitosis and non-mitosis classes...|$|E
