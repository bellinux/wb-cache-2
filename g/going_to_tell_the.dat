25|$|While {{appointed}} Prime Minister, {{the aftermath}} of the Portella della Ginestra massacre came to haunt Scelba again. On February 9, 1954, Gaspare Pisciotta was found dead in his cell. After Pisciotta had been sentenced to life in imprisonment and forced labour, he realized that he had been abandoned by all. He declared that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> whole truth, in particular who signed the letter which had been brought to Giuliano, which demanded the massacre at Portella delle Ginestra in exchange for liberty for the bandits and which Giuliano had destroyed immediately.|$|E
25|$|The arts of Southeast Asia have {{affinity}} with {{the arts of}} other areas. Dance in much of Southeast Asia includes movement of the hands {{as well as the}} feet, to express the dance's emotion and meaning of the story that the ballerina is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> audience. Most of Southeast Asia introduced dance into their court; in particular, Cambodian royal ballet represented them in the early 7th century before the Khmer Empire, which was highly influenced by Indian Hinduism. Apsara Dance, famous for strong hand and feet movement, is a great example of Hindu symbolic dance.|$|E
25|$|Sir Rowland {{wonders if}} there is {{anything}} written on the autographed papers in invisible ink and they test them, revealing the names of six distributors of drugs, including Costello. <b>Going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> police their findings, the sleeping Pippa is left alone and, after a moment, Jeremy re-enters and is about to smother the girl's face with a cushion when Clarissa comes back. She soon realises that he is the killer. He was away from the other two men for a time after they had gone to the club to eat and a remark Pippa made about seeing his golf club ("A golf stick like Jeremy had", {{in the context of the}} weapon used to kill Costello) ties in. He also rang the police to try to incriminate Clarissa. Jeremy confesses; his motive was the envelope that the autographed papers were kept in – on it is an extremely rare error stamp worth the fourteen thousand pounds. He is about to kill Clarissa when the police enter the room, having heard the exchange, and arrest him. They take him away. The others go to bed and Henry returns but without his diplomatic guests who have failed to turn up. Like the police inspector, he fails to believe a word his wife tells him of the evening's events...|$|E

500|$|According to {{academic}} Robin Ellen Visel, Rosa {{is a complicated}} person, with roles thrust on her by her parents, which suppresses her own goals and desires. Gordimer explained how she constructed the book's narrative structure to convey this struggle and explain Rosa: [...] "he idea came to me of Rosa questioning herself as others see her and whether what they see is what she really is. And that developed into another stylistic question—if you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> book in the first person, to whom are you talking?" [...] This led to Gordimer creating Conrad and Katya for Rosa to use as sounding boards to question and explain herself.|$|E

500|$|In 1967 {{when the}} Israeli nuclear program was nearing completion, Teller {{informed}} Neeman {{that he was}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> CIA that Israel had built nuclear weapons, and explain that it was justified by {{the background of the}} Six-Day War. After Neeman cleared it with Prime Minister Levi Eshkol, Teller briefed the head of the CIA's Office of Science and Technology, Carl Duckett. It took a year for Teller to convince the CIA that Israel had obtained nuclear capability; the information then went through CIA Director Richard Helms to the president at that time, Lyndon B. Johnson. [...] Teller also persuaded them to end the American attempts to inspect the Negev Nuclear Research Center in Dimona. In 1976 Duckett testified in Congress before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, that after receiving information from [...] "American scientist", he drafted a National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Israel's nuclear capability.|$|E

This encouraged Mercedes to [...] "take a long, hard look at herself", and she realised that she was doing the same thing in the situation with Warren. On her way to the court however, Mercedes was [...] "all over the place". According to Metcalfe, everyone was shocked when Mercedes walked into the courtroom. She said that Mercedes was unsure of what she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> court, [...] "but her alibi is vital to Warren's case - his fate lies in her hands". Metcalfe said that even if Mercedes and Russ ended their relationship, which they did shortly after she confessed the truth, would not matter because she believed that it would not take Mercedes [...] "long before she goes back to her old ways" [...] because [...] "that's just the type of person she is - Mercedes likes playing the field and having fun, and no man's going to change her" ...|$|E

Later that day, Neil chose to walk from the game due to an unspecified urgent personal matter; Joshuah was given the option to bring either Jacob or Sharon back as his partner, and he chose Sharon.
