5|$|The Beatles' rise to {{prominence}} in the United States in February 1964 was a significant development {{in the history of}} the band's commercial success. In addition to establishing the Beatles' international stature, it changed attitudes to popular music in the United States, whose own Memphis-driven musical evolution <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> a global trend-setter.|$|E
5|$|Although {{publishers}} worldwide <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> {{available for}} many years, English publishers refused to publish Tintin in the Congo {{because of its}} racist content. In the late 1980s, Nick Rodwell, then agent of Studios Hergé in the United Kingdom, told reporters of his intention to finally publish it in English and stated his belief that publishing the original 1931 black and white edition would cause less controversy than releasing the 1946 colour version. After more delay, in 1991—sixty years after its original 1931 publication—it {{was the last of}} The Adventures of Tintin to see publication in English. The 1946 colour version appeared in English in 2005, published by Egmont.|$|E

His funeral service was held at Aldeburgh Parish Church three days later, and he was buried in its churchyard, with a gravestone carved by Reynolds Stone. The authorities at Westminster Abbey had offered burial there, but Britten <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> clear that he wished his grave to be side by side with that, in due course, of Pears. A memorial service was held at the Abbey on 10 March 1977, at which the congregation was headed by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.|$|E
5|$|England won {{the final}} match by one wicket, but lost the series 2–1. While {{contemporary}} critics did not blame MacLaren, the cricket authorities were less happy.

He finished the series with 198 runs at 28.28, and ended the season with 1,254 first-class runs at 32.15.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, {{the city}} council changed their {{decision}} to close down the tramway. The main reason was the 1973 oil crisis, which <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> cheaper to run hydroelectric-powered trams than diesel-powered buses. After no investment on the tramway for seventeen years, new stock had to be bought, and Oslo Sporveier opted to buy seven used M-23 units from the Gothenburg Tramway in Sweden. In addition, twenty-five SL79 articulated trams were delivered in 1982 and 1983, followed by a further fifteen in 1989 and 1990. Oslo Sporveier merged with Holmenkolbanen in 1991, and with Ekebergbanen in 1993.|$|E

Yet Carson <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> clear she was not advocating the banning or complete withdrawal of helpful pesticides, but was instead encouraging responsible and carefully managed use with an awareness of the chemicals' impact on the entire ecosystem. In fact, she concludes her section on DDT in Silent Spring not by urging a total ban, but with advice for spraying as little as possible to limit the development of resistance.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the fall}} of the Republic, the {{authority}} of the Roman Senate had largely eroded under the quasi-monarchical system of government established by Augustus, known as the Principate. The Principate allowed the existence of a de facto dictatorial regime, while maintaining the formal framework of the Roman Republic. Most Emperors upheld the public facade of democracy, and in return the Senate implicitly acknowledged the Emperor's status as a de facto monarch. The civil war of 69 <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> abundantly clear that real power in the Empire lay with control over the army. By the time Vespasian was proclaimed emperor in Rome, any hope of restoring the Republic had long dissipated.|$|E
5|$|The FCI {{refused to}} suspend Petacchi, and he {{returned}} to racing in late July. Their decision, however, was not made to exonerate Petacchi, but rather {{because they did not}} believe they should hear the case, instead deferring to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The CAS heard the case, and Petacchi testified to the court, stating that the hot and humid day on which the stage was the run <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> so that he took several extra puffs from his inhaler, but that this was accidental and that most had come after he had already crossed the finish line and won the stage.|$|E

5|$|At 00:50, {{aircraft}} {{carrying the}} rest of the 6th Airborne Division appeared overhead and the paratroopers descended onto drop zones marked out by the pathfinders. Howard began blowing the morse code letter 'V' on his whistle, to help guide the 7th Parachute Battalion to the bridges. The first paratroops to arrive, at 00:52, were Brigadier Poett and the soldier he had picked up en route. Briefed by Howard on the situation, they heard tanks and lorries moving around in Bénouville and Le Port. On the drop zone, only about 100 men of the 7th Parachute Battalion <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to the rallying point but all their signal equipment, machine guns and mortars were missing. Pine-Coffin, aware that his battalion was the only unit allocated defensive positions west of the bridges, decided they could not wait any longer and, at 01:10, left for the bridges.|$|E
5|$|At the Stadttheater Mahler's {{repertory}} {{consisted of}} 66 operas of which 36 titles were new to him. During his {{six years in}} Hamburg he conducted 744 performances, amongst other he introduced: Verdi's Falstaff, Humperdinck's Hänsel und Gretel, and works by Smetana. However, {{he was forced to}} resign his post with the subscription concerts after poor financial returns and an ill-received interpretation of his re-scored Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Already at an early age Mahler <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> clear that his ultimate goal was an appointment in Vienna, and from 1895 onward was manoeuvring, with the help of influential friends, to secure the directorship of the Vienna Hofoper. He overcame the bar that existed against the appointment of a Jew to this post by what may have been a pragmatic conversion to Roman Catholicism in February 1897. Despite this event, Mahler {{has been described as a}} lifelong agnostic.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, The Beverly Hills Hotel became {{increasingly}} popular with Hollywood film stars. Fred Astaire took a shine to the hotel, and enjoyed reading the Daily Variety and The Hollywood Reporter by the pool. Cesar Romero and Carole Lombard were pictured {{together at the}} hotel in 1937. In 1938, the Sand and Pool Club was established at the hotel. It proved extremely popular, with white sand imported from Arizona, which made the pool area look like a beach. The following year, it began hosting fashion shows sponsored by local department stores such as Bullock's Wilshire. In 1940, one of the hotel's long-time patrons, Marlene Dietrich, was instrumental in bringing about a change in policy in the Polo Lounge, which <b>had</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> compulsory for women to don skirts which she refused to wear.|$|E
