50|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>dampers</b> can {{be found}} in the same places as smoke dampers, {{depending}} on the application of the area after the firewall. Unlike smoke dampers, they are not triggered by any electrical system (which is an advantage in case of an electrical failure where the smoke dampers would fail to close). Vertically mounted <b>fire</b> <b>dampers</b> are gravity operated, while horizontal <b>fire</b> <b>dampers</b> are spring powered. A fire damper's most important feature is a mechanical fusible link which is a piece of metal that will melt or break at a specified temperature. This allows the damper to close (either from gravity or spring power), effectively sealing the duct, containing the fire, and blocking the necessary air to burn.|$|E

40|$|FOREWORD Fire/smoke {{resisting}} dampers {{represent a}} major method {{used in the}} United Kingdom and other countries to prevent fire and smoke from passing from one compartment to another through Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. It is imperative that <b>fire</b> resisting <b>dampers</b> are adequately <b>fire</b> tested and are installed {{in accordance with the}} damper manufacturer’s instructions. Such instructions must take into account site conditions and the variable order of different trades from contract to contract. This document attempts to provide practical advice so that damper manufacturers, system designers and installers are able to consider the appropriate issues and at the design stage, to make the necessary decisions to ensure that dampers will function as intended by current regulations...|$|R
50|$|The {{bottle oven}} kiln is {{protected}} by an outer hovel, which helps to create an updraught. The biscuit kiln was filled with clay sealed saggars of green (un-fired) flatwares (bedded in flint) by placers. The doors (clammins) were bricked up and the firing began.

5000|$|The {{research}} and development team at Prefco developed 'The McCabe Link'- a resettable Bi-metal fire link that is a heat releasing device for fire and smoke protection applications. The McCabe Link became recognized as a life saving invention by the UL and ASHRAE. [...] Prefco also manufactured <b>fire</b> and smoke <b>dampers</b> that allow ventilation systems to draw toxic smoke from a building that is on fire. Their products are sold throughout the United States, Canada, South America, Asia and the Middle East. Prefco helped standardize the smoke control industry worldwide, and was instrumental in changing laws on fire regulation and safety.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>dampers</b> {{and smoke}} dampers are an {{integral}} and essential part of a building's passive fire protection system.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>dampers</b> are passive fire {{protection}} products used in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) ducts {{to prevent the spread}} of fire inside the ductwork through fire-resistance rated walls and floors. Fire/smoke dampers are similar to <b>fire</b> <b>dampers</b> in fire resistance rating, and also prevent the spread of smoke inside the ducts. When a rise in temperature occurs, the fire damper closes, usually activated by a thermal element which melts at temperatures higher than ambient but low enough to indicate the presence of a fire, allowing springs to close the damper blades. <b>Fire</b> <b>dampers</b> can also close following receipt of an electrical signal from a fire alarm system utilising detectors remote from the damper, indicating the sensing of heat or smoke in the building occupied spaces or in the HVAC duct system.|$|E
50|$|Air {{transfer}} <b>fire</b> <b>dampers</b> (ATFD) are {{not protected}} by ductwork and {{must therefore be}} installed and manufactured to standards and tests that take into account room fire exposures. Air transfer <b>fire</b> <b>dampers</b> are passive such as intumescent types or mechanical types. They are designed for fire resistance, direct flame resistance in the open state or for smoke resistance or for combinations. Some designs are for exterior use, some are for hygienic zone use and some are for Ex-zone applications.|$|E
40|$|Fires in {{enclosures}} {{equipped with}} mechanical ventilation remain {{one of the}} key issues for fire safety assessment in multifamily homes and industries. Therefore, a wide variation of methods for preventing smoke spread through the ventilation system exist and are applied, in performance-based designs. Through the use of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) model in the fire dynamics simulator, several different common and less common methods for preventing smoke spread in the ventilation system were tested. The effects on smoke spread with changing building leakage and fire growth rates were also investigated. The results were evaluated by determining the total soot spread from the fire room to other compartments connected to the ventilation system, as well as soot/thermal load on the fans and system in general. The maximum and average heat release rate was also of interest and hence compared between systems. It was found that, while many methods perform similar, a few proven methods, such as <b>fire</b> and smoke <b>dampers,</b> performed very well with very little smoke spread {{to the rest of the}} system. The study should be considered as an introduction to implementing a similar methodology in specific cases because different ventilations systems will present very different challenges and weaknesses...|$|R

50|$|Air {{transfer}} <b>fire</b> <b>dampers</b> {{for doors}} are designed and tested {{for use in}} the lower part of door leaves and cannot be installed elsewhere or higher. In Europe, the fire door test EN 14600 and EN 1634-1 applies.|$|E
50|$|According to {{building}} and fire codes, annual fire door inspections {{is the responsibility}} of the building owner. However, as with other mandatory fire inspections, such as the inspection of <b>fire</b> <b>dampers,</b> the fire door inspections are often omitted and many facilities are out of compliance.|$|E
50|$|Intumescent dampers may be {{qualified}} to ISO 10294-5:2005 <b>Fire</b> <b>dampers</b> for air distribution systems—Part 5: Intumescent <b>fire</b> <b>dampers.</b> They swell shut due to intumescence {{in the event}} of a fire. Unlike mechanical dampers, it is a physical/chemical reaction that causes the closure to work. Provided the intumescent is within demonstrable ageing and/or shelf life and providing the absence of massive combustible objects (sabotage), the damper is certified to maintain its functionality subject to its certification listing or type approval. In other words, cleaning (when necessary) and an age assessment comprise the inspection. The annulus of an intumescent damper is shut as per its certification listing, such that the intumescent can press against a shut frame to close the opening, thus eliminating annular smoke migration.|$|E
50|$|In regions which enforce NFPA Standards (e.g., North America), <b>fire</b> <b>dampers</b> and {{combination}} fire/smoke dampers require {{inspection and}} testing one year after installation, and then every 4 years; except in hospitals, where the frequency shall be every 6 years.

5000|$|Air {{transfer}} <b>fire</b> <b>dampers</b> for {{walls or}} floors are usually designed for flush installation {{and comes in}} multiple sizes. Dampers are listed for vertical or horizontal installation or both and for one- or two-way fire exposure.

5000|$|... {{closures}} (<b>fire</b> <b>dampers)</b> Sometimes firestops {{are treated}} in building codes identically to closures. Canada de-rates closures, where, for instance a 2-hour closure is acceptable {{for use in}} a 3-hour fire separation, so long as the fire separation is not an occupancy separation or firewall. The lowered rating is then referred to as a fire protection rating, both for firestops, unless they contain plastic pipes and regular closures.|$|E
50|$|Contrary {{to active}} fire {{protection}} measures, {{passive fire protection}} means do not typically require electric or electronic activation or a degree of motion. Exceptions to that particular rule of thumb are <b>fire</b> <b>dampers</b> (fire-resistive closures within air ducts, excluding grease ducts) and fire door closers, which must move, open and shut in order to work, {{as well as all}} intumescent products, which swell, thus move, in order to function.|$|E
50|$|Air {{transfer}} <b>fire</b> <b>dampers</b> in facades are vents {{applied in}} wall, eave soffit, gable or foundation. In the US, these {{are used to}} protect from exterior fire exposure from neighboring structure or via window-, arson- and wildfire (ASTM E2912 plus ASTM E119) or against wildfire only (ASTM E2886). In Europe, air transfer grilles for walls can be applied externally once a national assessment of suitability for the application in regards of embers, direct flame impingement, environmental impacts etc. has been done.|$|E
50|$|Dampers for ducts applied as air {{transfer}} dampers: Allowances {{exist for}} use of duct dampers as air transfer <b>fire</b> <b>dampers.</b> Since these typically will be too hot, and even allow penetration of flames to the unexposed side during fire, they must be modified and classified for such application. To achieve this they are tested with a grid on either side to prevent combustibles to be stored too close to hot parts or flaming. Some jurisdictions prescribe a general grid for use in front of listed duct dampers, which are not listed for use without ductwork.|$|E

50|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>dampers</b> are fitted where {{ductwork}} {{passes through}} fire compartment walls / fire curtains {{as part of}} a fire control strategy. In normal circumstances, these dampers are held open by means of fusible links. When subjected to heat, these links fracture and allow the damper to close {{under the influence of the}} integral closing spring. The links are attached to the damper such that the dampers can be released manually for testing purposes. The damper is provided with an access door in the adjacent ductworks for the purpose of inspection and resetting in the event of closure.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} pictures illustrate {{an example}} of a successful fire test that led to a UL listing or a three-hour fire protection rating. The entire assembly is exposed to a fire for the specified amount of time per the objective of the test. Following this heat exposure, a hose stream is applied to the door. Fire doors and <b>fire</b> <b>dampers</b> are derated from the fire barriers they are in. In this case, a 3-hour rated door is acceptable for use in up to a 4-hour wall. Because it goes into a 4-hour wall, it received a 45PSI (31N/cm²) hose stream test.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of fire tests apart from those on firestops. Walls and floors themselves can be tested, closures within them, such as windows, fire doors, <b>fire</b> <b>dampers,</b> structural steel, and more. Fire tests are conducted both on active fire protection and on passive fire protection items. Each have different test methods and scales. There are full scale, small scale and bench scale tests. There are tests on systems, such as the one below, but there are also tests on materials, such as intumescents, to be sure of components that may be used within a system.|$|E
50|$|When {{the fire}} alarm {{activates}} on a floor, audio instructions tailored to each {{floor of the}} building sound. All floors will receive an evacuation message, with a controlled evacuation message replayed to each floor in order of priority.

50|$|The aim {{for fire}} {{protection}} systems is typically demonstrated in fire testing the ability to maintain the item or the side to be protected at or below either 140 °C (for walls, floors and electrical circuits required to have a fire-resistance rating) or ca. 550 °C, which is considered the critical temperature for structural steel, above which it is in jeopardy of losing its strength, leading to collapse. This is based, in most countries, on the basic test standards for walls and floors, such as BS 476: Part 22: 1987, BS EN 1364-1: 1999 & BS EN 1364-2: 1999 or ASTM E119. Smaller components, such as <b>fire</b> <b>dampers,</b> fire doors, etc., follow suit in the main intentions of the basic standard for walls and floors. Fire testing involves live fire exposures upwards of 1100 °C, depending on the fire-resistance rating and duration one is after. More items than just fire exposures are typically required to be tested to ensure the survivability of the system under realistic conditions.|$|E
50|$|A {{fire door}} is a {{door with a}} fire-resistance rating (sometimes {{referred}} to as a fire protection rating for closures) used as part of a passive fire protection system to reduce the spread of fire and smoke between separate compartments of a structure and to enable safe egress from a building or structure or ship. In North American building codes, it, along with <b>fire</b> <b>dampers,</b> is often {{referred to as a}} closure, which can be derated compared against the fire separation that contains it, provided that this barrier is not a firewall or an occupancy separation. In Europe national standards for fire doors have been harmonised with the introduction of the new standard EN 16034, which refers to fire doors as fire-resisting door sets. Starting September 2016, a common CE marking procedure will be available abolishing trade barriers within the European Union for these types of products. In the UK, it is Part B of the Building Regulations that sets out the minimum requirements for the fire protection that must be implemented in all dwellings this includes the use of fire doors. All fire doors must be installed with the appropriate fire resistant fittings, such as the frame and door hardware, for it to fully comply with any fire regulations.|$|E
40|$|The {{conversion}} {{of an older}} Massachusetts building into condominiums illustrates a safe, durable, and cost-effective solution for heating and ventilation systems that can potentially benefit millions of multifamily buildings. Merrimack Valley Habitat for Humanity (MVHfH) partnered with U. S. Department of Energy Building America team Building Science Corporation (BSC) to provide high performance affordable housing for 10 families in the retrofit of an existing mass masonry building (a former convent). The original ventilation design for the project was provided by a local engineer and consisted of a single large heat recovery ventilator (HRV) located in a mechanical room in the basement with a centralized duct system providing supply air to the main living space and exhausting stale air from the single bathroom in each apartment. This design was deemed to be far too costly to install and operate for several reasons: the large central HRV was oversized and the specified flows to each apartment were {{much higher than the}} ASHRAE 62. 2 rate; an extensive system of ductwork, smoke and <b>fire</b> <b>dampers,</b> and duct chases were specified; ductwork required a significant area of dropped ceilings; and the system lacked individual ventilation control in the apartment...|$|E
40|$|Central {{ventilation}} systems with heat recovery have shown their limits especially {{within the context}} of building energy retrofit. The difficulties to install these systems in existing buildings, to find available space for devices, air ducts, silencers and <b>fire</b> <b>dampers</b> and to independently control the air flow in each room according to the real ventilation needs have led to an increasing market for decentralized ventilation devices. A frequent criticism of decentralized devices is the poor ventilation effectiveness due to a high short-circuiting risk. Therefore, the University of Applied Sciences of Offenburg and the Frauhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems are evaluating together the inside air quality reached with decentralized {{ventilation systems}}. The tests described in this paper were performed in a test lab representing a single room were a decentralized ventilation system with heat recovery, heating and cooling functions was implemented. In a first part of the evaluation process, tests are realized to characterize the air distribution provided by the decentralized device by smoke visualization. The results are showing interesting differences between isothermal, heating and cooling cases. The characterization of air distribution in the volume of the room is not enough to evaluate the capacity of a ventilation system to provide a good inside air quality. Therefore, a second series of tests was performed with CO 2 as a tracer gas, enabling a more precise quantification of the ventilation effectiveness. The results show the CO 2 concentrations over time in zones with different air renewal levels for each of the 3 modes...|$|E
