25|$|Elevators {{were added}} between the {{mezzanine}} and the platforms in November 2009, making the station {{more accessible to}} people with reduced mobility. However, there is currently no step-free access to the surface, nor do the elevators allow passengers to change platforms without exiting the ticket barriers. An existing elevator connecting the station to Place du Canada and the Château Champlain, formerly the only elevator in the system, is separated from the mezzanine level by steps. An <b>elevator</b> <b>link</b> between the station and the RTM bus terminus and thence to the surface is planned.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the opening}} of Line 5, the {{majority}} of metro stations have maintained <b>elevator</b> <b>links</b> to the train platform. Extensive signage {{and the lack of}} a direct path to the platform from the surface — customers must typically use two different shafts that are not close together — discourages the use of these elevators by able-bodied customers.|$|R
5000|$|Since 2005, {{when the}} LVMH {{flagship}} store opened in Paris at 3, avenue George V, 75008, the company presented close collaboration with contemporary artists. Features included a light sculpture by American James Turrell, a 20-metre (65 feet) long [...] "travelling staircase" [...] showcasing {{the work of}} American video artist Tim White-Sobieski and an <b>elevator</b> <b>linking</b> the store to the top floor by Iceland's Olafur Eliasson.|$|R
25|$|A {{reading room}} was {{continuing}} aft on the starboard side. This space's amidships {{was the first}} class writing room. The forward staircase's highest level was just aft with its burled panels and magnificent modern glass railings. Also, there was an <b>elevator,</b> <b>linking</b> the first class decks {{in this part of}} the ship. The deluxe suite facility started along port and aft passageways, to a small gymnasium, playroom, solarium, and message room on the starboard side. The aft part of Boat Deck, which had its own pool, lido and bar, was cabin class's facility.|$|R

The lower three floors of the building are occupied by {{a branch of the}} fashion retailer C&A, with the hotel above. The hotel's street level entrance hall faces Augsberger Strasse at its junction with Joachimstaler Straße and has a height of 11 m. Dedicated <b>elevators</b> <b>link</b> this hall with the hotel lobby, which is located on the third floor above ground level. Meeting rooms, restaurants and bars open off and surround the hotel lobby, which is two storeys tall and is lit by a glazed roof.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} two {{excavated}} tunnels with side platforms on the centre line, joined {{at each end}} by connecting passages. From these connecting passages there are triple escalators to/from mezzanine levels, which in turn each have flanking exits to ground level with escalators and stairs. At the east end, there are two separate <b>elevators</b> <b>linking</b> the platform with the mezzanine, and the mezzanine with the ground levels. There is also a stairwell at the east end from the platform level to the mezzanine level. The west end exits lead to {{the west side of}} Sankt Anna Straße at Sankt Anna Platz; the east end exits lead to Tierschplatz, where the tram 18 stop is located.|$|R

30|$|Wong et al. (2005) {{performed}} {{a study in}} which they used STEPS to demonstrate the increased evacuation efficiency of a 100 -storey high-rise building when applying a combined strategy of stairs and elevators. In particular, the strategy employed included the use of sky-lobbies and shuttle elevators. The total number of occupants in the evacuation was approximately 21, 000. The geometry of the building was very complex, including three stairs, four refuge floors and 14 shuttle <b>elevators</b> <b>linking</b> the refuge floors and the ground level. The proportion of evacuees waiting for the evacuation elevator on the refuge floors was calibrated {{through the use of}} patience coefficients and the estimation of queuing time. The study showed that the total evacuation time can be significantly reduced without complicated procedures, but using an efficient and simple relocation strategy. Wong et al. (2005) pointed out that there is still a need to investigate buildings of different heights, elevator capacity and go into more depth into the possible behavioural factors. An evacuation model was therefore employed in this case to optimize the egress strategy of a high-rise building, showing the impact of an adequate plan on the total evacuation time.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the demise}} of The Frantic <b>Elevators,</b> Hucknall <b>linked</b> up with manager Elliot Rashman. By early 1985, Hucknall and Rashman had {{assembled}} a band of local session musicians and begun to attract record company attention. The group adopted the name [...] "Red" [...] (after Hucknall's nickname, denoting his hair colour) but then Hucknall decided it would sound better {{with the addition of}} the word 'Simply'. The band's name is also linked to Hucknall's allegiance to being a supporter of Manchester United, as the club's home shirt colour is red.|$|R
40|$|Defect {{investigation}} {{is an important}} tool for quality improvement as it identifies {{the root cause of}} errors and steps to be taken to eliminate these. In this paper, four cases of defect investigation are presented. The case studies cover <b>link</b> <b>elevator,</b> wing-fuselage attachment bolt, and stiff nut for Lakshya unmanned aerial vehicle. It was observed that the <b>link</b> <b>elevator</b> was discolourised even though the material used was the stainless steel. Investigations revealed that the stainless steel was heat-treated. In the case of leading edge, it was found that there was no provision for the location of a component in the tool, resulting in mismatch. Thread damage was noticed in wing-fuselage attachment bolts because of over tightening. All these studies resulted in improvement in the raw material bonding, inspection procedures, and fabrication methods, thus resulting in quality improvement. </span...|$|R
2500|$|The IND {{mezzanine}} {{has opened}} in various phases. Around August 2011, the William Street {{end of the}} Eastern mezzanine opened, coinciding {{with the opening of}} the 135 William Street entrance. In October 2011, due to a major realignment of the temporary transfer passageway between the [...] and [...] stations, parts of the Western Mezzanine opened as well. The realignment sent passengers through the construction site of the Fulton Building, a practice that has still continued with the uptown [...] trains. By January 2012, the Western Mezzanine had opened to the Jamaica-bound [...] platforms. In June 2012, an underpass under the [...] platforms re-opened and became connected to the Western Mezzanine. It travels approximately under Fulton Street. With the opening of the new passageway, the older underpass connecting to southbound [...] platform was simultaneously closed. As a result, the Western Mezzanine is substantially completed. A white false wall separates the work area (transit center building) from the now-public passageways is put up in the Western Mezzanine. On August 2, 2012, almost a year since the new entrance on William Street opened, the Broad Street-bound [...] platform became connected to the Eastern Mezzanine. MTA officials have regarded this as the substantial completion of the entire IND mezzanine. However, contract work is still being undertaken in both the eastern and western halves; five new <b>elevators</b> <b>linking</b> the [...] platform and the mezzanine halves, and the two escalators connecting to William Street, were put into service by December 2012.|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} is an iron, archway bridge, constructed of reinforced concrete, asphalt deck. The deck {{is supported by}} a dual archway, united by corner narrow elements in concrete crosses. There are 76 pillars, with the largest four located near the main supports, near the massive rectangular columns, with smaller pillars regularly spaced along the exterior surfaces. These larger columns have <b>elevators</b> that <b>link</b> the deck level to the marginal roadway along the Douro. The elevator volumes, facing the interior of the bridge, include addorsed sculptures. The deck includes six lines of traffic for vehicular traffic (part of the European route E01 system) and two narrower lines for pedestrian passage.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two large}} towers {{overlooking}} Whanganui: the Durie Hill War Memorial Tower and the Bastia Hill Water Tower. The Durie Hill Tower is a World War I memorial, unveiled in 1926. Nearby is the Durie Hill <b>Elevator</b> (1919), which <b>links</b> the hilltop with Anzac Parade via a 66 m elevator and a 200 m underground tunnel. South of Whanganui is the Cameron Blockhouse.|$|R
500|$|Beth Mickle {{was hired}} as the film's {{production}} designer on Gosling's recommendation; they had worked together on 2006's Half Nelson. Prior to filming, Mickle supervised a crew of 40, routinely working 16- to 18-hour days. This was her most expensive film to date, and Mickle felt freer since [...] "there was another zero added to the budget," [...] {{compared to that of}} Half Nelson. The crew built the Driver's apartment building, which included a hallway and <b>elevator</b> that <b>linked</b> his unit to Irene's. Mickle also built a strip club set and Bernie Rose's apartment in an abandoned building. Turning a [...] "run-of-the-mill" [...] Los Angeles auto body shop into a grandiose dealership {{was one of the most}} challenging tasks. Painting the walls an electric blue color, she brought in a showroom full of vintage cars.|$|R
5000|$|The {{project had}} two goals: Passenger-oriented renovations {{included}} new platforms and pedestrian bridge, a central <b>elevator</b> bank <b>linking</b> the LIRR {{to the street}} and to the Sutphin Blvd subway station, a new mezzanine connecting to AirTrain and a new steel and glass canopy over the elevated tracks. The {{focal point of the}} project was the Jamaica Control Center, built by Tishman Construction Corporation and Bechtel. The JCC houses the LIRR offices, railroad control center and MTA Police. Overall, the renovations enlarged the station and have made it more modern and efficient, providing easier access to all eight LIRR tracks. The entire station complex, including AirTrain and the subway, is compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). The project was named [...] "2006 Project of the Year" [...] by the Long Island branch of the American Society of Civil Engineers.|$|R
50|$|The planned extension, {{which would}} connect to line 7 (now 7bis) {{at the station}} Pré-Saint-Gervais, {{stretched}} 2.157 km. It was constructed under the avenue Gambetta to Porte Lilas, where a turnaround loop was installed under the city walls. The terrain of the area, which was especially moist and unstable—due to the ancient Saint-Fargeau Lake—made construction difficult. As a result, the tunnel was built in a layer of gypsum, very deep underground; stations were contained in a reinforced vault, with <b>elevators</b> <b>linking</b> the platforms to the surface. Beyond the Porte des Lilas, a double-track tunnel extended by two single-track tunnels—the voie des Fêtes (south tunnel) and the voie navette ("shuttle line", north tunnel) connected the extension to line 7—allowing the latter to be extended to Porte des Lilas in the future.The work was nearly finished {{before the start of}} World War I, during which it ground to a halt. The project was returned to the CMP on 23 February 1920, but work did not resume immediately; the CMP waited for the city to provide the necessary funds that had been granted in the new 1920 convention. The final work was completed in December 1920.Although originally planned, the plan for trains on line 7 to continue to Porte des Lilas was eventually abandoned, as trains on line 3 provided an adequate service on this branch (at the time, line 11 did not yet exist). Nevertheless, in order to connect lines 3 and 7, a shuttle was planned to run through the north connecting tunnel, later named la voie navette. The Sprague-Thomson variant of rolling stock serviced this tunnel, taken from line 2. This variant measured 10.85 m in length and consisted of one train powered by two motors. With these changes, the voie des Fêtes and the Haxo station were left unused: the former serving as a train shed and the latter being left inaccessible to the public. The Gambetta - Porte des Lilas section and the shuttle were inaugurated on 27 November 1921.|$|R
50|$|The {{flight of}} 16 October ended when Cody {{attempted}} a turn to avoid {{trees and a}} wingtip touched the ground. The resulting crash caused substantial damage, {{and the rest of}} the year was spent in repairing it and making major modifications. The gap between the wings was increased from 8 ft (2.44 m) to 9 ft (2.74 m), the booms carrying both sets of control surfaces lengthened, and provision for lateral control made by installing a wing-warping system and fitting differentially-moving surfaces at each end of the elevator. The radiators were moved to the aft interplane struts, the triangle of canvas that had stretched between the trailing edge of the upper wing and the top of the rudder was removed, and the small vertical stabiliser was moved from above the top wing to a position between the centre booms supporting the <b>elevator,</b> and <b>linked</b> to the rudder control. New larger propellers were fitted.|$|R
50|$|The flying {{controls}} of the Belfast incorporated numerous features developed by Bristol and Canadair, {{in addition to}} Shorts; all three parties had heavily collaborated on its development. It used the same manual servo-tab system as used on the Britannia, but had some advancements, {{especially in terms of}} lateral control via a simpler spoiler configuration. Other advancements include the linking of the port aileron to the rudder to counteract adverse rolling due to rudder deflection, and the <b>elevator</b> is <b>linked</b> to the flaps to cancel out trim changes caused by flap operations. The Belfast was equipped with a full automatic landing system, produced by Smiths Aerospace, the first aircraft in the world to be designed to feature such capability from the onset of development. The autopilot and flight control system, known as the ASR 518, was triplex in the roll and pitch channels, with duplex or emergency simplex ability. The instrument landing system comprised many functions, such as an autothrottle, a head-up display, and radio altimeter.|$|R

40|$|Wind-tunnel {{tests of}} a 1 / 5 -scale semispan {{model of the}} Republic XF- 12 {{horizontal}} tail surface equipped with an internally balanced elevator were conducted in the 6 - by 6 -foot test section of the Langley stability tunnel. The tests included measurements of the aerodynamic characteristics of the horizontal tail with and without a beveled trailing edge and also included measurements of the tab characteristics. The variation of the aerodynamic characteristics with boundary-layer conditions and leakage in the internal-balance chambers, measurements of the boundary-layer displacement thickness near the elevator hinge axis, and pressure distributions at the mean geometric chord were also obtained. The {{results showed that the}} hinge-moment characteristics of the elevator were critical to boundary-layer conditions and internal-balance leakage. Increasing the boundary-layer displacement thickness by use of roughness strips reduced the rate of change of elevator hinge moments with tab deflection by about 20 percent. The present horizontal tail appears to be unsatisfactory for longitudinal stability with power on, however, an increase in horizontal-tail lift effectiveness should correct this difficulty. The maneuvering stick force per unit acceleration will be extremely critical to minor variations of the elevator hinge moments if the <b>elevator</b> is <b>linked</b> directly to the stick...|$|R
