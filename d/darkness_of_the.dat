5|$|In Islam, doves and {{the pigeon}} family {{in general are}} {{respected}} and favoured because they {{are believed to have}} assisted the final prophet of Islam, Muhammad, in distracting his enemies outside the cave of Thaw'r, in the great Hijra. A pair of pigeons had built a nest and laid eggs at once, and a spider had woven cobwebs, which in the <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night made the fugitives believe that Muhammad could not be in that cave.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Colonel Boerstler {{made for}} Frenchman’s Creek but {{four of his}} eleven boats, “misled by the <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night or the inexperienced rowers being unable to force them across the current, fell below, near the bridge and were forced to return”. Nevertheless, Boerstler’s seven {{remaining}} boats forced a landing, opposed by Lieutenant Bartley and his 37 men of the 49th Regiment. Boerstler led the attack, shooting with his pistol a British soldier {{who was about to}} bayonet him. Bartley's outnumbered force retired, pursued to the Frenchman's Creek Bridge by the Americans, who took two prisoners. Boerstler's men were then attacked by Captain Bostwick’s two companies of Norfolk Militia, who had advanced from Black Rock Ferry. After an exchange of fire in which Bostwick’s force lost 3 killed, 15 wounded and 6 captured, the Canadians retreated. Boerstler now encountered another problem: many of the axes provided for the destruction of the Frenchman’s Creek bridge were in the four boats that had turned back and those that were in the seven remaining boats had been left behind when the Americans fought their way ashore. Boerstler dispatched eight men under Lieutenant John Waring to “break up the bridge by any means which they could find”. Waring had torn up {{about a third of the}} planking on the bridge when it was learned from a prisoner that “the whole force from Fort Erie was coming down upon them”. Boerstler quickly re-embarked his command and rowed back to Buffalo, leaving behind Waring and his party at the bridge.|$|E

25|$|According to a {{description}} {{based on the}} work of Leszek Podhorecki, although the Poles were more aware that the battle was about to take place, the forces encountered one another in the <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night, and Żółkiewski decided to organize his army rather than engaging immediately, which also gave the Tsardom of Russia time to prepare. According to Mirosław Nagielski, however, the Poles under Żółkiewski purposefully chose to engage the opponent at that time, hoping to catch them asleep.|$|E

The grasslands of the Nullarbor are suitable for some sheep grazing and are also damaged by rabbits.|$|E

The Mexican authorities then asked the population to stay calm, since the massacre took place in a remote area and in the <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early morning.

25|$|The British frigates {{left the}} battle at 4 pm, and {{although}} after consulting among themselves the British commanders resolved return to fight at 4:30 pm, they finally withdrew {{half an hour}} later. The imminence of the nightfall {{and the possibility of}} running aground on the coast between Huelva and Ayamonte convinced Alonso de Torres y Guerra to turn back to Cádiz instead of chasing Galloway's division, but trying before to sail between the retreating British ships to shoot upon them two complete broadsides. The British vessels, however, managed to avoid the action by taking advantage of its fasteness and the <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dusk.|$|E

Beyond the figure of Osome herself, there is very little detail. The ground is made up of yellow horizontal lines on a brown background, and the sky is coloured with the bokashi technique of colour gradation, darkening from light grey to black as it reaches the top edge of the print. Osome looks up to her left with an uneasy facial expression, her gaze resting somewhere beyond the right border of the print.|$|E
25|$|The Milstein Hall of Ocean Life {{focuses on}} marine biology, botany and marine conservation. The hall is most {{famous for its}} -long blue whale model, {{suspended}} from the ceiling behind its dorsal fin. The hall's classic lines and visually arresting elegance host cutting-edge exhibition technology and the latest scientific research on the ocean. The 29,000-square-foot (2,700 m²) Hall {{has been transformed into}} a fully immersive marine environment with high-definition video projections, interactive computer stations, hands-on models, 14 renovated classic dioramas, and eight new ocean ecosystem displays that transport visitors from the rainbow-hued profusion of life in the Indo-Pacific coral reefs to the flickering bioluminescence of fishes in the eerie <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deep sea. The exhibit was first created by the AMNH Exhibitions Lab in 1933, was renovated in 1969 and once again in 2003 through funding provided by Paul and Irma Milstein.|$|E

25|$|P. exigua are small, swarm {{founding}} wasps. One {{can determine}} the wasps’ age by evaluating the <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cuticle on the apical edge of the fifth gastral sternite. Older wasps typically exhibit darker shades relative to others in its colony. The front wing length is generally 4.15mm, and their wings are more rounded than other wasps. This round wing shape may enhance the wasp species’ flying abilities and increase fitness. The muscle mass on P. exigua’s mesosoma directly contributes to flight power; the larger the muscle, the stronger the output. Instead of flapping their wings, P. exigua row them due to increased wing drag. Mature P. exigua eggs have a complete chorion and are tinted blue with a shiny coat. Immature oocytes that are equal in size to mature eggs can be distinguished due to their cream and less glossy appearance.|$|E
25|$|On October 20th, the French ship-of-the-line Triton under Captain Comte de Ligondès, {{cruising}} on the Bay of Biscay, fell in {{with the}} British ship-of-the-line Jupiter, under Captain Francis Reynolds, and the frigate Medea, under Captain James Montagu. At about 5 PM both sides were at close quarters; Jupiter ranged up {{on one side of}} the Triton, Medea on the other, about nightfall, and they cannonaded the Triton hotly. The French captain succeeded in turning the same broadside to both his assailants, putting Medea out of action with a thirty-six pound shot below the water line after the first half-hour of fight, but he was wounded in both arms soon afterward and had to hand over the command to Lieutenant de Roquart. Medea retreated from the action; Triton and Jupiter continued to exchange fire for more two hours, until a squall of wind and rain, and the impenetrable <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> night separated the combatants.|$|E
25|$|On the whole, Chartres' windows {{have been}} remarkably fortunate. The medieval glass largely escaped harm during the Huguenot iconoclasm and the {{religious}} wars of the 16th century although the west rose sustained damage from artillery fire in 1591. The relative <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interior {{seems to have been}} a problem for some. A few windows were replaced with much lighter grisaille glass in the 14th century to improve illumination, particularly on the north side and several more were replaced with clear glass in 1753 as part of the reforms to liturgical practice that also led to the removal of the jubé. The installation of the Vendôme Chapel between two buttresses of the nave in the early 15th century resulted in the loss of one more lancet window, though it did allow for the insertion of a fine late-gothic window with donor portraits of Louis de Bourbon and his family witnessing the Coronation of the Virgin with assorted saints.|$|E

50|$|Art {{historian}} Anthony Blunt linked {{this work}} to Blake's Nativity and Procession to Calvary, and contended {{that they provide}} insight to Blake's mindset at the time. The artist had earlier been preoccupied with <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> evil and <b>the</b> duality <b>of</b> human nature, but seemingly emerged and found hope through <b>the</b> ideal <b>of</b> salvation through Christ. According to Blunt, Blake conveys this through <b>the</b> motif <b>of</b> a bright light shining into <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> <b>of</b> mankind. In <b>the</b> present work this is perhaps expressed through the angel appearing in brilliantly illuminated colours from <b>the</b> <b>darkness</b> and foreboding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trees.|$|R
