40|$|The Crew Exploration Vehicle Parachute Assembly System (CPAS) {{is being}} {{designed}} {{to land the}} Orion Crew Module (CM) at a safe rate of descent at splashdown with a cluster of two to three Main parachutes. The instantaneous rate of descent varies based on parachute fly-out angles and geometric inlet area. Parachutes in a cluster oscillate between significant fly-out angles and colliding into each other. The former presents a sub-optimal inlet area and the latter lowers the effective drag area as the parachutes interfere with each other. The fly-out angles are also important in meeting a twist torque requirement. Understanding cluster behavior necessitates measuring the Mains with photogrammetric analysis. Imagery from upward looking cameras is analyzed to determine parachute geometry. Fly-out angles are measured from each parachute vent to an axis determined from geometry. Determining {{the scale of the}} objects requires knowledge of camera and lens calibration as well as features of known size. Several points along the skirt are tracked to compute an <b>effective</b> <b>circumference,</b> diameter, and inlet area as a function of time. The effects of this geometry are clearly seen in the system drag coefficient time history. Photogrammetric analysis is key in evaluating the effects of design features such as an Over-Inflation Control Line (OICL), Main Line Length Ratio (MLLR), and geometric porosity, which are varied in an attempt to minimize cluster oscillations. The effects of these designs are evaluated through statistical analysis...|$|E
50|$|Increasing {{the number}} of rollers doesn't {{increase}} the flow rate, instead it will decrease the flow rate somewhat by reducing the <b>effective</b> (i.e. fluid-pumping) <b>circumference</b> of the head. Increasing rollers does tend to decrease the amplitude of the fluid pulsing at the outlet by increasing {{the frequency of the}} pulsed flow.|$|R
40|$|Simulation {{analysis}} {{makes use}} of statistical distributions to specify the parameters of input data. It {{is well known that}} fitting a distribution to empirical data is more of an art than a science (Banks J., 1998, p. 74) because of the difficulty of constructing a 'good' histogram. The most difficult step is choosing an appropriate interval width. Too small a width will produce a ragged histogram, whereas too large a width will produce one that is overaggregated and block-like. De Beer and Swanepoel (1999) have developed 'Simple and <b>effective</b> number-of-bins <b>circumference</b> selectors' for creating histograms for the purpose of fitting distributions. When using simulation software such as Arena, one can generally fit distributions to input data using a built-in function in the software. If input distributions could be compared regarding their effect on the outcomes of a simulation model, one could assess whether input distributions generated by Arena could be accepted unconditionally or whether one should pay special attention to the input distributions used in the simulation model. In this study a simulation model of a computer helpdesk system is constructed to test the effect of input distributions. Distributions fitted with the 'circumference technique' are compared with those from the simulation package, Arena, and those calculated by the statistical package 'Statistica', and then compared with empirical distributions. In the helpdesk system, calls from employees experiencing problems with any computer hardware or software are logged, redirected when necessary, 'attended to, resolved and then closed. Queue statistics of the simulation model using input distributions suggested by Arena as opposed to input distributions deduced from the other methods are compared and a conclusion is reached as to how important or unimportant it is for this specific model to select appropriate input distributions.

40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} auricular acupoint stimulation on overweight and obese adults. Methods. We searched databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, National Knowledge Infrastructure, and the PerioPath Index to Taiwan Periodical Literature. The modified Jadad scale {{was used to assess}} study quality. We investigated the effect of auricular acupoint stimulation on anthropometric measurements. Results. Eighteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in our systematic review. Thirteen RCTs were pooled in a meta-analysis that revealed a significant reduction in body weight (BW) with a mean difference (MD) of - 1. 21 [*]kg and a 95 % confidence interval (CI) from - 1. 94 to - 0. 47 with a heterogeneity of I 2 = 88 %. Significant decreases in body mass index (BMI; MD: - 0. 57 [*]kg/m 2; 95 % CI - 0. 82 to - 0. 33; I 2 = 78 %), body fat (BF; MD: - 0. 83 %; 95 % CI - 1. 43 to - 0. 24; I 2 = 0 %), and waist circumference (WC; MD: - 1. 75 [*]cm; 95 % CI - 2. 95 to - 0. 55; I 2 = 87 %) were also revealed. Conclusions. This meta-analysis shows that auricular acupoint stimulation improves physical anthropometric parameters including BW, BMI, BF, and WC in overweight and obese adults. These methods are less <b>effective</b> on hip <b>circumference</b> and waist-to-hip ratio...|$|R
40|$|Type 2 DM in Indonesia {{is one of}} {{the main}} causes of non-communicable diseases, or about 2, 1 % of all deaths. Lack of {{participation}} in disease therapy can be the reason of poor outcome in patients, so they need self-management education and support to prevent acute complications and to reduce the risk of long-term complications. The aim of the present study was to determine HbA 1 c and BMI (body mass index) and waist-to-hip circumference ratio as the impact of the health education program. The design was an experimental study. Design used was the one-group pretest-posttest design. In the design of the test was done by comparing the results of one group were given health education before (pretest) and after the time given health education and 3 month after education (postest), and using nonprobability sampling with purposive sampling method. The health education program was given to the subject for 4 weeks. The research was initiated in May 2013, which involved 31 patients. Results showed significant differences in the HbA 1 c (z[*]=[*] 2. 357. p[*]=[*] 0. 018), BMI (t[*]=[*] 5, 247 p[*]=[*] 0. 000), and waist-to-hip circumference ratio (t[*]=[*] 4, 146 p[*]=[*] 0. 000). The regression results of BMI with HbA 1 C (t[*]=[*] 0206 p[*]=[*] 0. 053) and waist-to-hip circumference ratio with HbA 1 C (t[*]=[*] 1. 692 p[*]=[*] 0305) showed no significant. <b>Effective</b> contribution waist-to-hip <b>circumference</b> ratio and BMI on HbA 1 c is very small at only 1 % for BMI predictor and 10 % for waist-to-hip circumference ratio predictor. HbA 1 c and BMI (body mass index) and waist-to-hip circumference ratio can be improved by providing health education in patients with type 2 diabetes, although further research on the length of follow-up is still needed...|$|R
