5|$|Bacon <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> (or bacon-and-egg <b>ice</b> <b>cream)</b> is an <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> {{generally}} {{created by}} adding bacon to egg custard and freezing the mixture. The concept of bacon <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> originated in a 1973 sketch on the British comedy series The Two Ronnies as a joke; however, it was eventually created for April Fools' Day. Heston Blumenthal experimented {{with the creation}} of <b>ice</b> <b>cream,</b> making a custard similar to scrambled eggs then adding bacon to create one of his signature dishes. It now appears on dessert menus in other restaurants.|$|E
5|$|The {{large scale}} {{production}} of <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> also {{resulted from the}} ice trade. <b>Ice</b> <b>cream</b> had been produced in small quantities {{since at least the}} 17th century, but this depended both on having large quantities of ice available, and substantial amounts of labour to manufacture it. This was because using ice to freeze <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> relies both on the application of salt to an ice mixture to produce a cooling effect, and also on constantly agitating the mixture to produce the light texture associated with <b>ice</b> <b>cream.</b> By the 1820s and 1830s, the availability of ice in the cities of the U.S. east coast meant that <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> was becoming increasingly popular, but still an essentially luxury product. In 1843, however, a new <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> maker was patented by Nancy Johnson which required far less physical effort and time; similar designs were also produced in England and France. Combined with the growing ice trade, <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> became much more widely available and consumed in greater quantities. In Britain, Norwegian ice was used by the growing Italian community in London from the 1850s onwards to popularise <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> with the general public.|$|E
5|$|Hershey Creamery Company, {{also known}} as Hershey's <b>Ice</b> <b>Cream,</b> is a creamery that {{produces}} Hershey's brand <b>ice</b> <b>cream,</b> sorbet, sherbet, and frozen yogurt, and other frozen treats such as smoothies and frozen slab style <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> mixers. Founded by Jacob Hershey and four of his brothers in 1894 (all of whom have no relation to Milton S. Hershey and the chocolate company that he founded, also in 1894), it {{was taken over by}} the Holder family in the 1920s. The company {{was one of the first}} to offer consumers pre-packaged <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> pints. In 1998, it modernized its operations to increase efficiency and reduce overhead. With their shared names and cities of origin, Hershey Creamery and Hershey Company have had a tumultuous relationship marked by multiple lawsuits over trademark issues. In the mid-1990s, the companies settled their most recent legal battles out of court, with the creamery agreeing to add a disclaimer to its <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> products to note that it is not affiliated with The Hershey Company.|$|E

5|$|As bacon <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> {{was created}} in 1992 and came to {{prominence}} in the 2000s, there is no traditional recipe. Recipes generally involve adding bacon to a standard sweet <b>ice</b> <b>cream</b> recipe, often vanilla but other suggestions include coffee, rum or pecan. The saltiness of the bacon highlights {{the sweetness of the}} <b>ice</b> <b>cream.</b> According to one Wired.com article, the bacon should be candied prior to addition, a process which involves baking the bacon in a sugar syrup. This has the benefit of sweetening the bacon, in a similar manner to pancakes {{in some parts of the}} United States.|$|E
