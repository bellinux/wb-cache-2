5|$|Activated in 1985, the 10th Mountain Division's second brigade's {{elements}} saw numerous deployments to contingencies {{around the}} world in the 1990s. With the <b>Global</b> <b>War</b> on Terrorism the brigade has deployed six times: initially deployed to Uzbekistan, Kuwait and Qatar in 2001, elements of the brigade later deployed from Uzbekistan into Afghanistan; the brigade deployed again in early 2003, split across Iraq, Afghanistan and the Horn of Africa; the entire brigade returned to Iraq in 2004–2005, 2006–2007 and 2009–2010 before returning to Afghanistan in 2013 for its sixth deployment.|$|E
5|$|Operation Enduring Freedom is the {{official}} name used by the United States Government for its War in Afghanistan, together with three smaller military actions {{under the umbrella of}} its <b>Global</b> <b>War</b> on Terrorism. The war began on October 7, 2001 with the response of the United States and United Kingdom to the September 11 attacks in New York City and Arlington, Virginia. In early 2005, Murphy was assigned to SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team ONE as officer in charge of Alpha Platoon and deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of an}} American unified special {{operations}} command had its origins {{in the aftermath of}} Operation Eagle Claw, the disastrous attempted rescue of hostages at the American embassy in Iran in 1980. The ensuing investigation, chaired by Admiral James L. Holloway III, the retired Chief of Naval Operations, cited lack of command and control and inter-service coordination as significant factors in the failure of the mission. Since its activation on 16 April 1987, U.S. Special Operations Command has participated in many operations, from the 1989 invasion of Panama to the ongoing <b>Global</b> <b>War</b> on Terrorism.|$|E

50|$|<b>Global</b> <b>Wars</b> is a {{professional}} wrestling event held annually since 2012 by the American Ring of Honor (ROH) promotion. Originally named Border Wars, the event was renamed <b>Global</b> <b>Wars</b> in 2014 after ROH announced {{a partnership with the}} Japanese New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) promotion. Under the new name, the event became a supershow co-produced by the two promotions. The first five were held at the Ted Reeve Arena in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, while the sixth took place at the Frontier Fieldhouse in Chicago Ridge, Illinois. From 2012 to 2016, the event was held in May, but in 2017, <b>Global</b> <b>Wars</b> was moved to October and made a four-event tour across Buffalo, New York; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Columbus, Ohio; and Villa Park, Illinois.|$|R

5|$|World WarII (often {{abbreviated}} to WWII or WW2), {{also known as}} the Second World War, was a <b>global</b> <b>war</b> that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved {{the vast majority of the}} world's countries—including all of the great powers—eventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of total war, the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of the Cold War, Australian defence {{planning}} assumed that in the event of the outbreak of a <b>global</b> <b>war</b> between the Western world and Eastern bloc countries it would need to contribute forces under collective security arrangements as part of the United Nations, or a coalition led by either the United States or Britain. The Middle East was considered the most likely area of operations for Australian forces, where they were expected to operate with British forces. Early commitments included the involvement of RAAF aircrew during the Berlin Airlift in 1948–49 and the deployment of No. 78 Wing RAAF to Malta in the Mediterranean from 1952 to 1954. Meanwhile, defence preparedness initiatives included the introduction of a National Service Scheme in 1951 to provide manpower for the citizen forces of the Army, RAAF and RAN.|$|E
5|$|On November 23, 2005, Brown, {{together}} with U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and Marine Corps Commandant General Michael Hagee announced {{the creation of}} the Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC). Prior to the creation of MARSOC, the Marine Corps had not been involved in special operations, which were conducted by Army, Navy and Air Force units assigned to U.S. Special Operations Command. After the September 11 attacks, the Secretary of Defense had directed the Marine Corps and Brown's predecessor to work closer together in the <b>Global</b> <b>War</b> on Terror. This culminated in the creation of MCSOCOM Detachment One on June 19, 2003, shortly before Brown took command of USSOCOM. It was nearly three years later on February 24, 2006, when MARSOC was activated at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.|$|E

50|$|In February 2014, New Japan {{announced}} {{a partnership with}} ROH, which saw the promotion return to North America the following May to present two supershows; <b>Global</b> <b>Wars</b> in Toronto and War of the Worlds in New York City. During the tour, New Japan wrestlers also took part in an event held by Canadian promotion Border City Wrestling (BCW). A year later, NJPW and ROH {{announced a}}nother tour together to produce four more supershows; War of the Worlds '15 on May 12 and 13 in Philadelphia and <b>Global</b> <b>Wars</b> '15 on May 15 and 16 in Toronto.|$|R
5|$|The 130th Engineer Brigade mobilized {{in support}} of the <b>Global</b> <b>War</b> on Terrorism in 2003. It was {{commanded}} by Colonel Gregg F. Martin. As preparations were being made for Operation Iraqi Freedom, the 130th Engineer Brigade was placed in charge of the largest engineering force in the theater. This included seven different engineering battalions as well as several separate group and company sized elements. Units of the brigade were then deployed to Kuwait in early 2003, along with much of V Corps' staff. They would provide command and assistance for the 3rd Infantry Division, 82nd Airborne Division and 101st Airborne Division as they crossed the border to Iraq and attacked to the capitol region of Baghdad from the south. Coupled with the landings of the 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team to the north, the operation would see the US Forces surround and destroy Iraqi forces in and around the capitol.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{headquarters}} {{itself has}} not seen a deployment, even though all subordinate units have been deployed for several support missions. The 96th CA Battalion deployed units {{in support of the}} Iraq War in mid-2007. The brigade also had troops deployed in support of special operations units in Operation Enduring Freedom, Afghanistan. The brigade suffered several casualties in Iraq, including two soldiers killed by improvised explosive devices. One of these soldiers, a Major, prompted the State of California to fly its flags at half staff. It also suffered several casualties which were rehabilitated through the new Wounded Warrior Project. The 98th Civil Affairs Battalion also had soldiers deployed to Iraq before its activation in 2008. Soldiers of this battalion also saw deployments to Africa as well as other areas in support of the <b>Global</b> <b>War</b> on Terrorism.|$|E
5|$|The <b>global</b> <b>war</b> {{effectively}} ended much of {{the political}} power of Europe's dynasties. The naval career of her father, Prince Louis of Battenberg, had collapsed {{at the beginning of the}} war in the face of anti-German sentiment in Britain. At the request of King George V, he relinquished the Hessian title Prince of Battenberg and the style of Serene Highness on 14 July 1917 and anglicized the family name to Mountbatten. The following day, the King created him Marquess of Milford Haven in the peerage of the United Kingdom. The following year, two of her aunts, Alix, Empress of Russia, and Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna were murdered by Bolsheviks after the Russian revolution. At the end of the war the Russian, German and Austro-Hungarian empires had fallen, and Princess Andrew's uncle, Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse, was deposed.|$|E

50|$|In February 2014, ROH and NJPW {{announced}} a working relationship which would see talent exchanges and dual events {{between the two}} promotions. The first co-promoted shows <b>Global</b> <b>Wars</b> and War of the Worlds, took place in May 2014, in Toronto and New York City respectively, with the two companies again co-promoting these events in May 2015 - with the War of the Worlds '15 taking place at the 2300 Arena in Philadelphia on the 12th and 13th, and the <b>Global</b> <b>Wars</b> '15 event in Toronto on the 15th and 16th. As part of the relationship with NJPW, ROH announced it would promote two shows, entitled Honor Rising: Japan 2016, in Tokyo in February 2016.|$|R
5|$|When Russia {{invaded the}} Turkish Balkans in 1853, fears of Russian {{dominance}} in the Mediterranean and Middle East led Britain and France to invade the Crimean Peninsula to destroy Russian naval capabilities. The ensuing Crimean War (1854–56), which involved new techniques of modern warfare, was the only <b>global</b> <b>war</b> fought between Britain and another imperial power during the Pax Britannica and was a resounding defeat for Russia. The situation remained unresolved in Central Asia for two more decades, with Britain annexing Baluchistan in 1876 and Russia annexing Kirghizia, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan. For a while it appeared that another war would be inevitable, but the two countries reached an agreement on their respective spheres of influence in the region in 1878 and on all outstanding matters in 1907 with {{the signing of the}} Anglo-Russian Entente. The destruction of the Russian Navy by the Japanese at the Battle of Port Arthur during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05 also limited its threat to the British.|$|E
5|$|After Desert Storm, {{the army}} {{struggled}} with military operations other than war, such as peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations. The school and its graduates examined the situations in Bosnia, Haiti, and Somalia. Graduates {{also participated in}} Defense Support of Civil authorities missions. The course continued {{to change in the}} 1990s. Under Colonel Gregory Fontenot, the school moved from Fort Leavenworth's Flint Hall to Eisenhower Hall in October 1994. In later years, the school's leadership expanded the number of seminars and the civilian faculty. The military continues to draw heavily on SAMS in the twenty-first century. SAMS planners have {{played a significant role in}} the <b>Global</b> <b>War</b> on Terror. Beginning in 2002, the United States Central Command requested planners from SAMS and its sister schools, the United States Air Force's School of Advanced Air and Space Studies (SAASS), which was designed to be similar to SAMS, and the United States Marine Corps's School of Advanced Warfighting (SAW). SAMS students from the 2002 and 2003 classes participated as planners in the preparations for the invasion of Iraq and the plan for the post-combat occupation.|$|E
5|$|Formed {{out of the}} Division Support Command of the 82nd Airborne Division, {{the brigade}} {{has a long history}} of {{supporting}} the 82nd in numerous contingencies throughout the world. The sustainment brigade supported the division in operations including Operation Just Cause, Operation Urgent Fury, Operation Power Pack and Operation Desert Storm. Recently, the brigade has seen multiple deployments in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The brigade's mission in support of Operation Enduring Freedom-Afghanistan came to an end when responsibility was handed to the 101st Sustainment Brigade during a ceremony at Bagram Airbase on 2 December 2010. For the first time since the <b>Global</b> <b>War</b> on Terror began in 2001, with the exception of Delta Detachment, 82nd Finance, all the elements of the 82nd Sustainment Brigade were home in Fort Bragg. Since then, the 82nd Sustainment Brigade has once again been called upon to assist in OEF Afghanistan by establishing and controlling CMRE operations. On 21 May 2015, the brigade realigned back under the 82nd Airborne Division and became the 82nd Airborne Division Sustainment Brigade.|$|E
50|$|<b>Global</b> <b>Wars</b> {{featured}} eight professional wrestling matches {{that involved}} different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable {{characters in the}} scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.|$|R
50|$|War of the Worlds, unlike <b>Global</b> <b>Wars,</b> {{featured}} several interpromotional matches between NJPW and ROH, {{leading to}} Gedo and Jado booking the show together with Delirious with Rocky Romero {{acting as the}} intermediary as both sides had wrestlers they wanted to protect.|$|R
50|$|Continuing the {{partnership}} between NJPW and ROH, {{these were the}} first co-produced shows between the two promotions {{to take place in}} Japan. In 2014 and 2015, the two held joint shows, entitled <b>Global</b> <b>Wars</b> and War of the Worlds, in Canada and the United States.|$|R
