5|$|By the 5thcentury, the Romans had {{withdrawn}} from Britain, and the Angles and the Saxons settled. A heptarchy of new kingdoms began to emerge. One {{of the methods}} used by regional kings to solidify their authority over their territories {{was the use of}} ceremony and insignia. The tomb of an unknown king– evidence suggests it may be Rædwald of East Anglia– at Sutton Hoo provides insight into the regalia of a pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon king. Inside the early 7th-century tomb discovered in 1939 was found the ornate Sutton Hoo helmet, comprising an iron cap, a neck guard, and a face mask, decorated with images of animals and warriors in copper-alloy and set with garnets. He was also buried with a heavy whetstone sceptre, on top of which is an <b>iron</b> <b>ring</b> surmounted by the figure of a stag; a decorated sword; and a ceremonial shield.|$|E

In {{addition to the}} professional societies and chartering organizations efforts with their members, the Canadian <b>Iron</b> <b>Ring</b> and American Order of the Engineer trace their roots to the 1907 Quebec Bridge collapse. Both require members {{to swear an oath}} to uphold ethical practice and wear a symbolic ring as a reminder.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the opening}} scene of The 36th Chamber of Shaolin (1978), Gordon Liu {{practices}} the Hung Gar form [...] "Tien Sin Kuen" [...] or [...] "Iron Wire Form" [...] using <b>iron</b> <b>rings.</b> The movie Crippled Avengers (1978) (also known as The Return of the 5 Deadly Venoms) Dao Chang (Lu Feng) depicts the use of <b>iron</b> <b>rings</b> for sparring and fighting. In the movie Kung Fu Hustle, <b>iron</b> <b>rings</b> were used by actor Chiu Chi Ling (a master of Hung Gar), who {{played the role of}} an effeminate tailor who specializes in fighting with <b>iron</b> <b>rings.</b> In the movie Drunken Master, actor Jackie Chan used <b>iron</b> <b>rings</b> while practicing the horse stance.|$|R

25|$|Faraday's {{breakthrough}} {{came when}} he wrapped two insulated coils of wire around an <b>iron</b> <b>ring,</b> and found that upon passing a current through one coil a momentary current was induced in the other coil. This phenomenon {{is now known as}} mutual induction. The iron ring-coil apparatus is still on display at the Royal Institution. In subsequent experiments, he found that if he moved a magnet through a loop of wire an electric current flowed in that wire. The current also flowed if the loop was moved over a stationary magnet. His demonstrations established that a changing magnetic field produces an electric field; this relation was modelled mathematically by James Clerk Maxwell as Faraday's law, which subsequently became one of the four Maxwell equations, and which have in turn evolved into the generalization known today as field theory. Faraday would later use the principles he had discovered to construct the electric dynamo, the ancestor of modern power generators and the electric motor.|$|E
25|$|The {{first step}} was the {{construction}} of a large shaft on the south bank at Rotherhithe, 150feet (46m) back from the river bank. It was dug by assembling an <b>iron</b> <b>ring</b> 50feet (15m) in diameter above ground. A brick wall 40feet (12m) high and 3feet (91cm) thick was built on top of this, with a powerful steam engine surmounting it to drive the excavation's pumps. The whole apparatus was estimated to weigh 1,000 tons. The soil below the ring's sharp lower edge was removed manually by Brunel's workers. The whole shaft thus gradually sank under its own weight, slicing through the soft ground rather like an enormous pastry cutter. The shaft became stuck at one point during its sinking as the pressure of the earth around it held it firmly in position. Extra weight was required to make it continue its descent; 50,000 bricks were added as temporary weights. It was realised that the problem was caused because the shaft's sides were parallel; years later when the Wapping shaft was built, it was slightly wider at the bottom than the top. This non-cylindrical tapering design ensured it did not get stuck. By November 1825 the Rotherhithe shaft was in place and tunnelling work could begin.|$|E

50|$|Many {{different}} types of rings are available. The Chi Sau Ring is used for conditioning the body in many stances, and exercises. Four-inch-diameter (4 in) Chi Sau Rings weigh 600 g; 5 in <b>iron</b> <b>rings</b> weigh 800 g. Some <b>iron</b> <b>rings</b> are sold in sets, such as two small and two large rings. Some rings are made of other metals such as steel or brass, and rattan rings are also used for exercise.|$|R
500|$|Workers began casting an <b>iron</b> <b>ring.</b> [...] As {{the noise}} level and tension built, driven by the {{relentless}} rhythm {{of the music and}} the drumming, participants mimed repetitive mechanical movements associated with industrial processes such as weaving. Four glowing orange rings gradually began to be carried high above the stadium toward its centre on overhead wires, and then the ring seemingly being cast and forged in the arena began to lift. [...] The five rings converged, still glowing and accompanied by steam and firework effects {{to give the impression that}} they were of hot metal. [...] When the five rings formed the Olympic symbol above the stadium, they ignited and rained fire in silver and gold. [...] The image of the Olympic rings in flame became the iconic image of the ceremony, reproduced in newspapers and web stories around the world.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was while}} in school that Pisemsky started writing. [...] "My 5th form teacher of {{literature}} credited me with having talent; in the 6th form I wrote a novella called The Circassian Girl, {{and in the}} 7th a still longer one entitled The <b>Iron</b> <b>Ring,</b> both worthy of mention, apparently, only as stylistic exercises, dealing {{as they did with}} things I was totally ignorant of at the time," [...] Pisemsky remembered. He sent The <b>Iron</b> <b>Ring</b> (a novel telling of his first romantic passion) to several Saint Petersburg journals and met with all-round rejection. Several months later, already a university student, he gave the novel to Stepan Shevyryov. The professor's reaction was negative and he made a point to discourage the young man from writing about things he knew nothing about.|$|E

2500|$|A trip hammer has {{the head}} mounted {{at the end}} of a {{recumbent}} , hence the alternative name of helve hammer. [...] The choice of which type was used in a particular context may have depended on the strain that its operation imposed on the helve. [...] This was normally of wood, mounted in a cast <b>iron</b> <b>ring</b> (called the hurst) where it pivoted. [...] However, in the 19th century the heaviest helves were sometimes a single casting, incorporating the hurst.|$|E
2500|$|Bernard {{discovered}} many animal bones including sheep, cattle, {{goats and}} birds. He found stone items including [...] "sling-stones", [...] "warrior's clubs" [...] and a [...] "sugar-loaf-shaped stone with a well-cut base" [...] long, [...] round base, [...] round centre and [...] round top.

50|$|A brass ring {{is a small}} grabbable {{ring that}} a {{dispenser}} presents to a carousel rider {{during the course of}} a ride. Usually there are a large number of <b>iron</b> <b>rings</b> and one brass one, or just a few. It takes some dexterity to grab a ring from the dispenser as the carousel rotates. The <b>iron</b> <b>rings</b> can be tossed at a target as an amusement. Typically, getting the brass ring gets the rider some sort of prize when presented to the operator. The prize often is a free repeat ride. The phrase to grab the brass ring is derived from this device.|$|R

2500|$|In 1922, Kipling, who {{had made}} {{reference}} {{to the work of}} engineers in some of his poems, such as [...] "The Sons of Martha", [...] "Sappers", and [...] "McAndrew's Hymn", and in other writings, including short story anthologies such as The Day's Work, was asked by University of Toronto civil engineering professor Herbert E. T. Haultain for his assistance in developing a dignified obligation and ceremony for graduating engineering students. Kipling was enthusiastic in his response and shortly produced both, formally entitled [...] "The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer". Today, engineering graduates all across Canada are presented with an <b>iron</b> <b>ring</b> at the ceremony as a reminder of their obligation to society. In 1922 Kipling also became Lord Rector of St Andrews University in Scotland, a three-year position.|$|E
2500|$|In Faraday's first {{experimental}} demonstration (August 29, 1831), {{he wrapped}} two wires around {{opposite sides of}} an <b>iron</b> <b>ring</b> or [...] "torus" [...] (an arrangement similar to a modern toroidal transformer). Based on his understanding of electromagnets, he expected that, when current started to flow in one wire, a sort of wave would travel through the ring and cause some electrical effect on the opposite side. He plugged one wire into a galvanometer, and watched it as he connected the other wire to a battery. He saw a transient current, which he called a [...] "wave of electricity", when he connected the wire to the battery and another when he disconnected it. This induction {{was due to the}} change in magnetic flux that occurred when the battery was connected and disconnected. Within two months, Faraday found several other manifestations of electromagnetic induction. For example, he saw transient currents when he quickly slid a bar magnet {{in and out of a}} coil of wires, and he generated a steady (DC) current by rotating a copper disk near the bar magnet with a sliding electrical lead ("Faraday's disk").|$|E
