50|$|In their {{research}} with their Berkeley sample {{in the early}} 1980s, Main and colleagues {{also found that the}} three classifications of adult discourse they had identified correlated with the Ainsworth classifications of infant Strange Situation behavior. Secure-autonomous adult responses were associated with secure <b>infant</b> <b>behavior</b> towards the speaker, dismissing responses with insecure-avoidant <b>infant</b> <b>behavior</b> towards the speaker and preoccupied responses with insecure-ambivalent <b>infant</b> <b>behavior</b> towards the speaker. How a parent spoke about their own attachment history was therefore found to be associated with their infant's attachment behavior towards them in the Strange Situation, and subsequent research has replicated this finding. The association has even been found in research where the AAI has been conducted before the birth of the first child. That patterns of adult discourse correlate with <b>infant</b> <b>behavior</b> in the Strange Situation is a surprising and rather remarkable finding.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Attachment, as {{described}} by Bowlby (1969), is an emotional bond between two people. It is an invisible internal characteristic which is assumed to exist because of behaviors exhibited by the attached individual. These proximity seeking behaviors are critical for survival of the infant. Sensitivity of the mother to the <b>infant's</b> <b>behavior</b> cues may lead the mother to respond contingently and appropriately to her infant {{and is one of}} the indicators of an attached mother-infant relationship (Ainsworth, 1977). However, there may be barriers to the process of attachment for the mother and her infant if the infant is ill or preterm. Because of the interactive nature of attachment, it is important to assess both maternal and infant characteristics in order to increase knowledge about those barriers. The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationships of the infant's illness state, maternal contact with her infant, and the mother's perception of her infant to the mother's sensitivity and responsiveness to her <b>infant's</b> <b>behavior</b> during feeding interactions while the infant was hosptialized. Fifty-three mother-infant dyads participated in the study. Data were collected by auditing the infant's chart, evaluating questionnaires completed by the mother, and coding of videotapes of feeding interactions the first time the mother fed the infant and a feeding interaction within 24 hours prior to the infants' discharge from the hospital. The Nursing Child Assessment Feeding Scale (NCAFS) was used to record sensitivity and responsiveness during feeding interactions. Hypothesized relationships were only partially supported by the findings of this study. Infant illness was significantly positively correlated to maternal sensitivity and responsivenss during the feeding interactions in spite of the finding of no relationship between infant illness and <b>infant</b> <b>behaviors.</b> Also, the mothers of the sicker infants rated their infants as having more difficulty with the <b>infant</b> <b>behaviors</b> assessed on the "Your Baby" form of the Neonatal Perception Inventory (NPI). Therefore, the sicker the infant, the more sensitive and responsive the mother was to her infant and the more the mother stated that her infant had difficulty with spitting up, eating, sleeping, predictability in schedule, and with bowel movements. These findings were robust regardless of the gestational age of the infant. Maternal contact and maternal perceptions of her infant compared to the average infant (NPI) were not correlated to maternal sensitivity and responsiveness during feeding interactions. These findings lead to the conclusion that mothers of ill infants may not be at such a risk for difficulty in maternalinfant interaction difficulty due to unrealistic expectations of <b>infant</b> <b>behaviors,</b> poorly organized <b>infant</b> <b>behaviors,</b> and/or limited contact with their infants...|$|R

Ninety-four primiparous mothers completed measures on <b>infant</b> sleep-wake <b>behaviors</b> at two weeks, three and six months. Significant developmental changes were found on <b>infant</b> sleep-wake <b>behaviors</b> from two weeks to six months. Twoweek- old infants sleep 13. 3 h, spend 8. 7 h awake, awake 6. 1 times, have 0. 4 h of latency to sleep, and 3. 2 h of longest sleep period. Three-month-old infants sleep 13. 0 h, spend 9. 2 h awake, awake 5. 5 times, have 0. 4 h of latency to sleep, and 5. 2 h of longest sleep period.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the mother-infant {{interaction}} process by the lag sequential analysis. The examination of the lag sequential relation between mother and <b>infant</b> <b>behaviors</b> was carried out using conditional probability. To compare the magnitude of concurrent mother's and <b>infant's</b> <b>behaviors</b> such as visual, tactile, and vocal behaviors, a new method using conditional frequency percentage as an index of the lag sequential analysis on mother-infant interaction was designed. By this method, the lag sequential relation between mother and <b>infant</b> <b>behaviors</b> for both one pair and several pairs could be examined. The subjects were 13 pairs of mother-infant aged 3 months, participating in 'Tokyo Study projects'. They were classified into two categories according to the degree of interactions, high activity group(7 pairs) and low activity group(6 pairs). One of the pairs belonging to the low activity group was subjected to the lag sequential analysis of motherinfant interaction at the age of 8, 12 months. The observational data on mother-infant interaction at each month(3, 8, 12 months) were obtained by home visits conducted as a part of 'Tokyo Study Projects' in 1977 - 1979. The main results were as follows. 1) The lag sequential relations on visual and vocal behaviors between mother and infant were different from that of their tactile behaviors. 2) In high activity pairs, following the initiation, the receptor tends to return and continue the same modal behavior. 3) In the low activity pairs, the receptor tends to return but soon stop the behavior. 4) At 3 months, most of the mother-infant interactions were carried out through tactile behaviors. 5) Although, at 3 months, mother's and <b>infant's</b> vocal <b>behaviors</b> didn't occur as many as their visual and tactile behaviors, active interactions between mother and infant followed teir mutual vocal behaviors. 6) The amount of mother-infant vocal interactions gradually increased during the first year of life and patterns of the lag sequential relations of these interactions differed also in each period(3, 8, 12 months) ...|$|R

40|$|Breastfeeding {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to provide various health benefits for the mother and child in both the short-term and long-term. One factor, however, that impedes the continuation of breastfeeding is the perception that breast milk is insufficient. Despite good infant development drinking breast milk alone, the mother may feel anxious regarding the amount of breast milk she is producing and unnecessarily supplement with artificial milk. Cross-sectional studies have revealed many factors involved in this perception of breast milk insufficiency, such as inadequate knowledge of breastfeeding and maternal stress, {{especially with regard to}} <b>infant’s</b> <b>behavior,</b> including crying. 　This study was performed to clarify the relationship between mothers’ perception of breast milk insufficiency with their perception of <b>infant’s</b> <b>behavior</b> between the early postpartum period and one month postpartum. 　Inclusion criteria for subjects were 1 ） a full-term birth between 37 weeks and 42 weeks of gestation, 2 ） singleton birth, 3 ） normal pregnancy for both mother and child, and 4 ） infant birthweight of at least 2500 g. Data were collected from January 2012 to August 2013. Connectable anonymous self-administered questionnaire surveys were conducted twice— once during hospitalization and once at the one-month checkup. Of the 78 subjects that consented to participate in the study, 12 subjects that did not meet the requirements were excluded, leaving 66 subjects（ 84. 6 %） for the analysis. 　The perceptions of breast milk insufficiency in the early postpartum period and at the one-month checkup were 12. 4 ± 2. 5 points（ mean±SD） and 12. 1 ± 3. 7 points, respectively.
