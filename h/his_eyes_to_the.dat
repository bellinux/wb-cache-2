25|$|A {{high school}} English teacher {{convinced}} {{him to go to}} college. He enrolled at Pan American University in Edinburg, Texas, in 1965, intending to major in engineering. Living in south Texas made him curious about his roots there, and he enrolled in a Texas history which, he said, opened <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> exploitation of Mexican Americans and farmworkers. A local Roman Catholic priest assisted him in obtaining financial aid, and he transferred to Ohio Northern College (a private, United Methodist Church-affiliated school) in 1966. He transferred to Bluffton College (a private, Mennonite-affiliated school) a year later. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in sociology in 1969.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} was suddenly changed, however, and Philip was tardily forced {{again into the}} opposition against the Emperor, by the Treaty of Crépy of 1544, which opened <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> danger threatening Protestantism. He prevented the Roman Catholic Duke Henry V of Brunswick-Lüneburg from taking forcible possession of his dominions and unsuccessfully planned a new alliance with German princes against Austria, pledging its members to prevent {{the acceptance of the}} decrees of the projected Council of Trent. When this failed, he sought to secure the neutrality of Bavaria in a possible war against the Protestants and proposed a new Protestant alliance {{to take the place of}} the Schmalkaldic League.|$|E

25|$|Directly east of Verona was {{the suburb}} of Veronetta, which the Austrians had heavily fortified. In addition, the bridges between Verona and Veronetta were well-covered by Austrian artillery. Therefore, Masséna turned <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{west side of}} Verona, to the suburb of San Giorgio, which was {{accessible}} by a stone bridge known as the Castelvecchio Bridge (Ponte di Castelvecchio). Vukassovich was responsible for defending the area. The Austrian division commander had a wall built across {{the center of the}} bridge and fortified San Giorgio. However, Vukassovich only allocated two battalions to its defense. He deployed six battalions in the hills northeast of Verona, while the remainder of his division lay farther north, maintaining contact with Hiller's corps.|$|E

500|$|According to the hagiography of Theodore of Syceon, Domentziolus {{was married}} to a lady named Irene, and had three sons. Elizabeth Dawes {{summarizes}} the tale given as following: [...] "Domnitziolus, patrician and curopalates, asks Theodore to visit him in Arcadianae. His wife Eirene has no children: the saint blesses her and promises her three children - and they will be boys. All the male and female slaves of the household are brought to Theodore for his blessing. A slave girl had long been ill, troubled by a hidden demon. He beats on her breast and the demon declares itself. Then the Saint laying her on the ground Put his foot on her neck, turned <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east and uttered a silent prayer. At the end of his prayer he recited aloud the doxology of the Holy Trinity. For some time the slave girl remained speechless and then was completely cured. Later Eirene gave birth to three sons, as the Saint had prophesied. The conception of her first son immediately followed the Saint's prayer. Emperor and Patriarch say farewell to Theodore and he returns to his monastery." [...] Since Theodore died by 613, the tale would have to occur prior to this date.|$|E

2500|$|In Norse mythology, Mímisbrunnr (Old Norse [...] "Mímir's well") {{is a well}} {{associated}} with the being Mímir, located beneath the world tree Yggdrasil. Mímisbrunnr is attested in the Poetic Edda, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. The well is located beneath one of three roots of the world tree Yggdrasil, a root that passes into {{the land of the}} frost jötnar where the primordial plane of Ginnungagap once existed. In addition, the Prose Edda relates that the water of the well contains much wisdom, and that Odin sacrificed one of <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> well in exchange for a drink.|$|E

2500|$|The Warrior of Light, Aymeric, and Alphinaud {{race against}} time to find aid against Nidhogg, asking his brood-brother Hraesvelgr for assistance. After going through trials to prove their worth, the great wyrm joins Ishgard in the final battle. Though Nidhogg defeats Hraesvelgr in single combat, the latter's play is revealed—he had given one of <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Warrior of Light to combine with the full power of Hydaelyn's blessing. The adventurer slays the wyrm-shaped shade and manages to pry the accursed eyes from Estinien's armor with Alphinaud's aid, tossing them into the ravine. The horde retreats in disarray, {{signalling}} the true end to the war. Estinien recovers from his coma and relinquishes his title as Azure Dragoon, quietly escaping the city to live his post-vengeance life. As his final act as Lord Commander, Aymeric establishes a parliamentary democracy in Ishgard ruled by both lowborn and highborn citizens, represented by the House of Commons and House of Lords. Though eager to leave the public service, he is quickly elected into chairing the latter to his chagrin. Count Edmont concludes his narration by penning the last words of his memoir, [...] "Heavensward".|$|E
2500|$|In 1816, {{with the}} {{experiences}} of the war before him, no well-informed statesman could shut <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> national aspects of the problem. Even President Madison invited the attention of Congress to the need of establishing [...] "a comprehensive system of roads and canals". Soon after Congress met, it took under consideration a bill drafted by Calhoun which proposed an appropriation of $1,500,000 ($ in [...] consumer dollars) for internal improvements. Because this appropriation was to be met by the moneys paid by the National Bank to the government, the bill was commonly referred to as the [...] "Bonus Bill". But on the day before he left office, President Madison vetoed the bill because it was unconstitutional. The policy of internal improvements by federal aid was thus wrecked on the constitutional scruples of the last of the Virginia dynasty. Having less regard for consistency, the House of Representatives recorded its conviction, by close votes, that Congress could appropriate money to construct roads and canals, but had not the power to construct them. As yet the only direct aid of the national government to internal improvements consisted of various appropriations, amounting to about $1,500,000 for the Cumberland Road.|$|E
