5|$|Dean Dull {{initiated}} a {{group known as}} the Ramblin' Wreck Committee of the Student Council to aid in his search for a mascot. When the Wreck was found in 1961, the Ramblin' Wreck Committee was chaired by Dekle Rountree. Rountree would <b>drive</b> <b>the</b> Wreck for school functions and Student Council fundraisers. He {{was also the first}} person to <b>drive</b> <b>the</b> Ramblin' Wreck onto Grant Field. Don Gentry, the president of Reck Club in 1961, was the first student to <b>drive</b> <b>the</b> Wreck as he aided in retrieving the Model A from Ted Johnson's home. The Wreck was always maintained by Reck Club but the complete transition of control occurred between 1964–1967. During this period, Reck Club was relieved of its RAT rules enforcement duties and given more wholesome jobs of maintaining the Wreck, upholding traditions, and generating school spirit.|$|E
