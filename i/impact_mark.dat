40|$|The {{ability of}} Homo sapiens to kill prey at a {{distance}} is arguably one of the catalysts for our current ecological dominance. Despite the importance of projectile technology in human hunting strategies, {{there is still no}} consensus on when it first emerged. Most evidence has stemmed from analysis of the lithic projectiles themselves, not the trauma left on the bones of hunted prey. There is {{a growing body of research}} focused on zooarchaeological projectile <b>impact</b> <b>marks</b> in European assemblages; however, comparable investigations are rare in the African Middle Stone Age (MSA), where it has been suggested that simple hafted projectile technology first arose. There are no standardised criteria for identifying projectile <b>impact</b> <b>marks</b> on bone and no large experimental studies exist that examine marks left by MSA points specifically. This paper defines the various forms of stone-tipped projectile <b>impact</b> <b>marks</b> on bone using a large and variable experimentally-produced sample, and then applies this system to description of marks left by replica MSA Levallois and Howieson 2 ̆ 7 s Poort points. The differences between projectile <b>impact</b> <b>marks</b> and slicing cut marks, marks created by different projectile modes (spear and arrow), lithic typologies (Levallois and Howieson 2 ̆ 7 s Poort), and distances (long versus short range) are examined.

5000|$|In June 2009, HRW {{issued a}} report {{entitled}} [...] "Precisely wrong", presenting an investigation of six UAV attacks that resulted in large civilian death. HRW concluded that in the cases probed, Israeli forces either failed to take all feasible precautions to verify that the targets were combatants, or failed to distinguish between combatants and civilians and to target only the former; as a result, HRW deduce that these attacks were a violation of International Humanitarian Law. The report methodology included interviews with victims and witnesses, investigations of the attack sites and IDF and media reports; the probes {{were based on the}} presumption that the <b>impact</b> <b>mark</b> and the fragmentation patterns were consistent with the Israeli-produced Spike missile that are used by the drones.

Spike's manufacturer, Israeli concern Rafael, says the missile can be fired not only by drones, but by helicopters, infantry units and naval craft. Several military experts said that drones may reach operational heights of 4,000 metres; the launch of a missile at that altitude would likely elude the naked eye. HRW military expert also conceded that two of the incidents cited took place in the evening or night, something that could potentially rule out anyone seeing the small aircraft.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT TAPHONOMIC SIGNATURES OF ANIMAL SCAVENGING IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA: A FORENSIC ANTHROPOLOGICAL ANALYSIS by Lisa N. Bright Master of Arts in Anthropology California State University, Chico Spring 2011 Taphonomy is an {{important}} component of forensic anthropology, archaeology, bioarchaeology and paleoanthropology. The ability to understand the factors that result in the breakdown of organic remains in multiple contexts is a necessary component of anthropological research. Forensic taphonomic research is invaluable for understanding postmortem events that affect human remains in medicolegal contexts. This thesis analyzes scavenging damage on forensic cases curated by the California State University, Chico Human Identification Laboratory (CSUC-HIL) and involves actualistic experiments, using five pigs (Sus scrofa) to better understand scavenger behavior and modification of human remains in northern California. The xvii human remains cases (n = 22) were inventoried and scavenger modification and tooth <b>impact</b> <b>mark</b> diameter was documented. The pig remains were collected and examined {{in the same manner as}} the CSUC-HIL forensic sample. Results indicate that there is significant variation in the distribution of scavenging damage in the CSUC-HIL forensic sample. Distal appendicular elements were less intensively scavenged than more proximal segments and areas with the greatest damage coincide with large fat deposits. The tooth <b>impact</b> <b>mark</b> data indicated that it is not possible to assign the damage to a specific species but rather to a size class of large or small carnivore. Actualistic experiments indicated that there is a specific order in which scavengers access carrion, with damage concentrated in areas with the largest amount of fat. Future scavenging research is necessary to gain an understanding of scavenger modification of human remains and should include natural environmental settings. CSU, Chic...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} impact damage and {{permanent}} indentation modelling.

The different impact damages developing during an impact test, i. e. matrix cracking, fibres failure and interfaces delamination, are simulated. The interlaminar damages, i. e. interfaces delamination, are classically simulated thanks to interface finite elements based on the fracture mechanics. The particularity of this model is {{to account for the}} intralaminar damages, i. e. matrix cracks, thanks to interface finite elements which respect their discontinue character. These interface elements allow equally to simulate the permanent indentation during the impact unloading.

40|$|After every Shuttle mission, the Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are {{recovered}} and observed for missing material. Most of the SRB {{is covered with}} a cork-based thermal protection material (MCC-l). After the most recent shuttle mission, STS- 114, the forward section of the booster appeared to have been impacted during flight. The darkened fracture surfaces indicated that this might have occurred early in flight. The scope of the analysis included microscopic observations to assess the degree of heat effects and locate evidence of the impact source as well as chemical analysis of the fracture surfaces and recovered foreign material using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy. The amount of heat effects and presence of soot products on the fracture surface indicated that the material was impacted prior to SRB re-entry into the atmosphere. Fragments of graphite fibers found on these fracture surfaces were traced to slag inside the Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) that forms during flight as the propellant is spent and is ejected throughout the descent of the SRB after separation.

40|$|Far-field optical {{microscopy}} using focused light {{is an important}} tool {{in a number of}} scientific disciplines including chemical, (bio) physical and biomedical research, particularly with respect to the study of living cells and organisms. Unfortunately, the applicability of the optical microscope is limited, since the diffraction of light imposes limitations on the spatial resolution of the image. Consequently the details of, for example, cellular protein distributions, can be visualized only to a certain extent. Fortunately, recent years have witnessed the development of 'super-resolution' farfield {{optical microscopy}} (nanoscopy) techniques such as stimulated emission depletion (STED), ground state depletion (GSD), reversible saturated optical (fluorescence) transitions (RESOLFT), photoactivation localization microscopy (PALM), stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), structured illumination microscopy (SIM) or saturated structured illumination microscopy (SSIM), all {{in one way or another}} addressing the problem of the limited spatial resolution of far-field optical microscopy. While SIM achieves a two-fold improvement in spatial resolution compared to conventional optical microscopy, STED, RESOLFT, PALM/STORM, or SSIM have all gone beyond, pushing the limits of optical image resolution to the nanometer scale. Consequently, all super-resolution techniques open new avenues of biomedical research. Because the field is so young, the potential capabilities of different super-resolution microscopy approaches have yet to be fully explored, and uncertainties remain when considering the best choice of methodology. Thus, even for experts, the road to the future is sometimes shrouded in mist. The super-resolution optical microscopy roadmap of Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics addresses this need for clarity. It provides guidance to the outstanding questions through a collection of short review articles from experts in the field, giving a thorough discussion on the concepts underlying super-resolution optical microscopy, the potential of different approaches, the importance of label optimization (such as reversible photoswitchable proteins) and applications in which these methods will have a significant <b>impact.</b> <b>Mark</b> Bates, Christian Eggelin...|$|E
40|$|Mixtures of {{expanded}} polystyrene (EPS) wastes and gypsum, characterization and uses in construction. Francisco Javier González Madariaga The {{expanded polystyrene}} (EPS) recycling technique exposed here consists {{in the formation}} of EPS wastes and gypsum-water mixtures with different proportions and under different conditions. One of the objectives for this thesis is to determine the components proportions for the gypsum-EPS wastes mixtures to be used as plasterboards and panels in construction also the work done here includes the determination of some of the new plasterboards and panels main properties. The experimental work at the new materials is the main part in this thesis. In the latest experimental section 14 physical and mechanical resistance tests have been done to 290 specimens. Among 68 different mixtures tested only 8 were selected and applied in 2 construction materials: one with similar uses to gypsum plasterboards and the other one with similar uses to a thermal insulating panel. The plasterboard mixtures have been produced with a main gypsum proportion and a reduced percentage of EPS wastes. From the plasterboard tests we know that plasterboards made of gypsum-EPS wastes are more prone to total water absorption (14 % more) and the new material is 23, 1 % lighter than the standard laminated gypsum plasterboards (10 kg/m 2) available in the market, both materials 12, 5 mm thick. The flexure resistance for the new plasterboards with EPS wastes complies the UNE 102035 - 1 M: 2001 Spanish Norm by more than 24 N. The fire reaction test developed here allows the research team to propose a Euroclasses level of B, s 2, d 0 for the new plasterboard materials because they show under a punctual fire attack a very limited combustion and a slow and limited smoke production with no ignited dropping particles. The impact resistance test of the new plasterboards shows that they exceed the limits by more than 2, 29 mm of the Spanish Norm mentioned before where the maximum <b>impact</b> <b>mark</b> diameter accepted is 20 mm. The mixture selected to by used in a thermal insulation panel has a high EPS waste percentage and a little of gypsum-water. From the insulation panel tests: they show a 20. 7 % mean of water absorption which is higher than the percentage accepted by the Spanish Norm UNE-EN 12087. The new panel has a density of 193 kg/m 3 which is superior to a brand new EPS panel's density (Type III 15 kg/m 3) this result is similar or superior to others researcher's publications who work on construction materials made of alike components. The EPS wastes-gypsum panel could be classified to flexure resistance as a BS 350 material (349, 9 kPa) according the European Norm UNE-EN 13163 : 2002 which is a higher level to a new EPS panel type III (15 kg/m 3) with a flexure resistance of 124 kPa, level BS 115. The thermal conductivity index for the selected EPS wastes- gypsum mixture was 0, 065 W/mK which is 12, 3 % higher than a new EPS Type I (0, 057 W/mK) and 66 % higher than a type III EPS panel (0, 039 W/mK). This is an original work which has produced several optimized mixtures of EPS wastes and gypsum-water. The new materials developed here are useful for manufacturing of construction elements with similar applications like gypsum plasterboard and EPS panels which in one hand cooperate to recycle EPS wastes and in the other hand they save the gypsum quantities required for its production.
