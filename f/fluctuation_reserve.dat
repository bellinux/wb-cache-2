40|$|A {{traditional}} {{argument in}} favor of flexible exchange rates is that they insulate output better from real shocks, because the exchange rate can adjust and stabilize demand for domestic goods through expenditure switching. This argument is weakened in models with high foreign currency debt and low exchange rate pass-through to import prices. The present study evaluates the empirical relevance of these two factors. We analyze the transmission of real external shocks to the domestic economy under fixed and flexible exchange rate regimes for a broad sample of countries in a Panel VAR and let the responses vary with foreign currency indebtedness and import structure. We find that flexible exchange rates do not insulate output better from external shocks if the country imports mainly low pass-through goods and can even amplify the output response if foreign indebtedness is high.

Simulations of a shock to required reserves show that although raising reserve require- ments is successful in sterilizing excess reserves, it creates a procyclical e¤ect for real economic activity. This result implies that financial stability may come at a cost of macroeconomic stability. The findings also indicate that using an augmented Taylor rule in which the policy interest rate is adjusted in response to changes in excess re- serves reduces volatility in output and inflation but increases fluctuations in financial variables. To the contrary, using a countercyclical reserve requirement rule helps to mitigate <b>fluctuations</b> in excess <b>reserves,</b> but increases volatility in real variables. ...|$|R

Evidence from data over the period 1983 – 2003 for 47 LDCs - of which 20 qualify as HIPCs by the IMF-World Bank criteria - suggests that there are significant differences in the way the reserve flows respond to their main determinants in the two sets of countries.

In this study, a groundwater flow model of this aquifer is developed and calibrated for the period 1983 - 2004. The model reproduces the observed flow-field and the water balance components reasonably well. Five scenarios are defined to evaluate the response to different pumping situations. These scenarios show that groundwater heads will continue to decrease with the present pumping discharge rates. To account for variations in the model results due to uncertainties in average recharge rates, randomly generated recharge realizations with different levels of uncertainty are simulated. Evaporation flow rates and groundwater flowing out of the modelled area seem unaffected by the recharge uncertainty, whereas the storage terms can vary considerably.

We find that exchange rate flexibility has not prevented economic integration between Canada and the United States from increasing substantially, during the 1990 s, and has played a useful role in buffering the Canadian economy against asymmetric external shocks. A fixed exchange rate thus does not seem to be a prerequisite for economic integration.

40|$|Maternal productivity, {{defined as}} weight of cow-calf {{output per unit}} of feed {{consumed}} {{on an annual basis}} is complex with many component traits interacting with on-farm management to determine overall production efficiency. This thesis implemented an interdisciplinary research approach that integrated qualitative social science and quantitative animal science to examine the output components of maternal productivity. Such an approach generated an understanding about factors associated with maternal productivity from both an animal science perspective and also as perceived by seedstock breeders. The initial qualitative research revealed divergence in seedstock breeder‟s perspectives on topics associated with maternal productivity. Specifically, attitudes to animal management with regard to grazing management, cow energy <b>reserve</b> <b>fluctuation</b> and the utilisation of fat reserves were varied. Breeder‟s attitudes on these topics were associated with divergence in perspectives on the importance of selection for production traits including yield, growth and milk compared with selection for perceived resilience traits including subcutaneous fat and earlier maturity pattern. The outcomes from the initial qualitative research drove the analysis of animal performance data collected through the Cooperative Research Centre for Beef Genetic Technologies Maternal Productivity Project. These analyses included understanding • the repeatability of cow body composition traits • associations of Breedplan EBVs with cow energy reserves • genetic correlations between cow body composition traits, • associations between genetic merit, nutrition and cow body energy reserves with reproductive rate Objectively measured body composition traits had moderate to high between time repeatability. In addition, Breedplan EBVs for EMA, Rib, Rump (P 8) and IMF were closely related to the equivalent ultrasound measure in Angus and Hereford cows at pre-calving and weaning in the first two parities. Breedplan carcass EBVs were not associated with cow body composition change during lactation. Together these results indicate that currently available Breedplan carcass EBVs change cow body composition, and that selection for increased fatness at a young age will result in cows that are fatter. Cow body composition traits were moderately heritable and had high to very high between time genetic correlations indicating that at the genetic level, cow body composition traits are genetically very similar across time (pre-calving and weaning) and age (first and second parity). P 8 and Rib EBV and pre-calving P 8 and rib fat depth were associated with several components of reproductive rate with varying effects depending on parity, calving season and nutrition. The importance of genetic and phenotypic fatness on reproductive rate was larger in autumn calving and low nutrition production systems. Breeders viewed results presented on associations between reproductive rate and EBVs and energy reserves as unsurprising and also as supporting their varied perspectives and current selection direction. In addition, weighting of EBVs in a selection index was associated with variance in calving rate. The implications of these results are that the varied selection emphasis by breeders involved in this project may be appropriate. Relationships between lifetime cow maternal productivity, supply chain profitability, on-farm production system and genetic merit need to be addressed to enable beef breeders to make informed animal selection and management decisions. By working closely with livestock breeders, and listening to, and understanding their observations, perspectives and beliefs on maternal productivity, and also in analysing animal performance data, there has been considerable benefit in generating a greater understanding of the production system and the interactions that occur within it. The outcome of this approach has been to firstly demonstrate and explain the varied perspectives held by seedstock breeders on associations between genetic merit and maternal productivity; and secondly, using animal performance data demonstrate how and why many of the observations and contrasting perspectives of breeders appear justified.

40|$|A obesidade está associada com a inflamação crônica atribuída à liberação de citocinas e adipocinas, à homeostase desregulda da glicemia e à dislipidemia. Intervenções nutricionais são frequentemente acompanhadas por episódios repetidos de perda e recuperação do peso, fenômeno conhecido como efeito sanfona ou ciclagem da massa {{corporal}}. Foram avaliados os efeitos da ciclagem da massa corporal sobre os parâmetros: eficiência alimentar, massa corporal (MC), perfil lipídico, metabolismo de carboidratos, indíce de adiposidade corporal, marcadores inflamatórios, esteatose hepática e triglicerídeo (TG) hepático em camundongos C 57 BL/ 6 machos que ciclaram a massa corporal duas ou três vezes consecutivas pela alternância de dieta hiperlipídica (high-fat, HF) e dieta padrão (standard-chow,SC). Após cada ciclo de dieta HF, os animais ficavam cada vez mais pesados e, após cada ciclo de dieta SC, os animais perdiam cada vez menos peso. A ciclagem da massa corporal provocou flutuação nas reservas de gordura e nos lipídeos sanguíneos. O colesterol total dos animais, após mudança da dieta HF para dieta SC, apresentou redução dos seus valores, assim como os TG plasmáticos. No teste oral de tolerância à glicose, após o perído de ingestão da dieta HF, os animais apresentaram intolerância à glicose e, após a troca para dieta SC, os animais continuaram com intolerância à glicose. Em relação as adipocinas e citocinas, a leptina, resistina e o fator de necrose tumoral (TNF) alfa séricos aumentaram após o ciclo da dieta HF e diminuíram após a troca por dieta SC. Ao contrário, a adiponectina sérica diminuiu após dieta HF e aumentou após troca por dieta SC. A IL- 6 aumentou após ingestão da dieta HF, porém após a troca para dieta SC, a IL- 6 permaneceu elevada. Enquanto o MCP- 1 não variou durante as trocas de dietas. A expressão da adiponectina no tecido adiposo diminuiu após a dieta HF e os valores permaneceram reduzidos mesmo após a troca para dieta SC. As expressões da leptina e IL- 6 no tecido adiposo aumentaram após dieta HF e continuaram aumentados mesmo após a troca para dieta SC. Da mesma forma, a esteatose hepática e os TG hepáticos não reduziram após a mudança da dieta HF para dieta SC. Tanto a dieta HF, como a ciclagem da massa corporal são relevantes para o remodelamento do tecido adiposo e provoca repercussões nos lipídios séricos, na homeostase da glicose, na secreção de adipocinas e provoca acúmulo de gordura no fígado. A troca para dieta SC e redução da MC não são capazes de normalizar a secreção de adipocinas no tecido adiposo e nem das citocinas pró-inflamatórias que permaneceram aumentadas. A esteatose hepática e os TG hepáticos também não são recuperados com a troca para dieta SC e redução da massa corporal. Estes resultados indicam que a ciclagem da MC cria um ambiente inflamatório, que é agraado com adipocinas alteradas, intolerância à glicose e acúmulo de gordura no fígadoObesity {{is associated}} with low-grade chronic inflammation attributed to release of cytokines and adipokines and to dysregulated glucose-insulin homeostasis and dyslipidemia. Nutritional interventions such as dieting are often accompanied by repeated bouts of weight loss and regain, a phenomenon known as weight cycling (WC). In this work we studied the effects of WC on the parameters: feed efficiency, body mass (BM), blood lipids, carbohydrate metabolism, adiposity, inflammatory markers, hepatic steatosis and hepatic triglyceride (TG) in C 57 BL/ 6 male mice that WC two or three consecutive times by alternation of a high-fat (HF) diet with standard chow (SC). The body mass (BM) grew up in each cycle of HF feeding, and decreased after each cycle of SC feeding. After three consecutive WC, less marked was the BM reduction during SC feeding, while more severe was the BM increase during HF feeding. After each cycle of the HF diet body mass grew up in each cycle of HF feeding, became increasingly heavier and after each cycle of SC feeding, the animals lost less weight. The WC mass caused <b>fluctuations</b> in fat <b>reserves</b> and blood lipids total cholesterol, after shift the HF diet by SC diet showed a reduction of their values and plasma TG. The oral glucose tolerance test after the regular intake of HF diet, the animals showed glucose intolerance and, after switching to SC diet, the animals continued with glucose intolerance. Regarding the adipokines and cytokines, leptin, resistin and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) serum increased after the cycle of HF feeding and decreased after the switch to SC feeding. In contrast, serum adiponectin decreased after HF feeding and increased after dietary exchange for SC. The IL- 6 increased after intake of HF diet, but after switching to SC feeding, which remained elevated, while the MCP- 1 was not changed during the shift of diets. The expression of adiponectin in adipose tissue decreased after the HF feeding and the values remained low even after switching to diet SC. The expression of leptin, IL- 6 in the adipose tissue increased after HF feeding and remained elevated after the change to SC diet. Similarly, hepatic steatosis, and hepatic TG not reduced after the change to the diet HF diet SC. The {{results of the present}} study showed that both the HF diet and WC are relevant to BM evolution and fat pad remodeling in mice, with repercussion in blood lipids, homeostasis of glucose-insulin, adipokine levels and causes fat accumulation in the liver.
