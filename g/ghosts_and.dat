5|$|Concealed shoes {{hidden in}} the fabric of a {{building}} have been discovered in many European countries, as well as {{in other parts of the}} world, since at least the early modern period. Independent researcher Brian Hoggard has observed that the locations in which these shoes are typically found– in chimneys, under floors, above ceilings, around doors and windows, in the roof– suggest that some may have been concealed as magical charms to protect the occupants of the building against evil influences such as demons, <b>ghosts</b> <b>and</b> witches. Others may have been intended to bestow fertility on a female member of the household, or been an offering to a household deity.|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} with the concentration of activity within the Dairi, the Greater Palace began {{to be regarded as}} increasingly unsafe, especially by night. One reason may be the prevalent superstition of the period: uninhabited buildings were avoided for fear of spirits and <b>ghosts,</b> <b>and</b> even the great Buraku-in compound was thought to be haunted. In addition, the level of actual security maintained at the palace went into decline, and by the early 11th century only one palace gate, the Yōmeimon in the east, appears to have been guarded. Hence burglary and even violent crime became a problem within the palace by the first half of 11th century.|$|E

5|$|It {{is often}} {{suggested}} that the Last Sonata, in B-flat major, is a farewell work in which Schubert faces his own death (somewhat analogous to the myths surrounding Mozart's Requiem); this is usually ascribed to the relaxed, meditative character which dominates the two opening movements. Death scenes are also associated, somewhat more explicitly, with the more tragic C minor Sonata; Charles Fisk, for example, mentions <b>ghosts</b> <b>and</b> a 'dance of death', in the outer movements. However, when judging from a biographical point of view, the notion that Schubert felt his imminent death {{at the time of}} composing the last sonatas is questionable.|$|E
5|$|Odd Inc. {{was founded}} by Tatsuya Minami in February 2006. Like the founders of Clover Studio, Minami worked at Capcom prior to {{founding}} his own studio. He joined Capcom and for 20 years was involved in titles such as Super Ghouls 'n <b>Ghosts,</b> <b>and</b> the Mega Man franchise. However, he decided to leave as he became tired of making sequels. Minami became the studio's head {{and focused on the}} company's management and administration, while Mikami, Inaba and Kamiya remained in the positions of director or producer.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} plan for Luigi's Mansion involved a game where the levels revolved {{around a large}} mansion or complex. Tests were later done with Mario characters in dollhouses and such. Once it was transitioned into a GameCube project, Luigi {{was selected as the}} main character {{in order to keep the}} game original and new. The other gameplay ideas, such as <b>ghosts</b> <b>and</b> the ghost-sucking vacuum cleaner, were added later. Older concepts, such as a role-playing game-like system which made real-time changes to rooms, as well as an underground cave area located under the mansion, were also scrapped due to the inclusion of the new ideas.|$|E

5|$|The {{shell of}} the object is so hard that even a boron nitride drill makes no impression, and when the attempt is made, {{vibrations}} cause severe distress in people around the object. Quatermass interviews local residents and discovers <b>ghosts</b> <b>and</b> poltergeists have been common {{in the area for}} decades. A hysterical soldier is carried out of the object, claiming to have seen a dwarf-like apparition walk through the wall of the artefact, a description that matches a 1927 newspaper account of a ghost.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the corners}} of the maze are four larger, {{flashing}} consumables known as Power Pills that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the <b>ghosts</b> <b>and</b> earn bonus points. When a Power Pill is in effect the enemies turn blue and try to evade Pac-Man. When a ghost is eaten its disembodied eyes return to the nest (center box) to respawn. The blue ghosts turn reddish during the last moments of a Power Pill’s effect, signaling that they are about to become dangerous again, and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one level to the next, becoming shorter as the game progresses. The final consumable items are the Vitamins, which appear periodically directly below the nest.|$|E
5|$|Screenwriter Gidding, who {{had worked}} with {{director}} Wise on the 1958 film I Want to Live!, began a six-month write of the script after reading the book, which Wise had given to him. He perceived the book to be more about mental breakdown than <b>ghosts,</b> <b>and</b> although he was informed after meeting author Shirley Jackson that it was very much a supernatural novel, elements of mental breakdown were introduced into the film. The film was shot at MGM-British Studios in the United Kingdom on a budget of US$1.05 million, with exteriors and the grounds shot at Ettington Park (now the Ettington Park Hotel) in the village of Ettington, Warwickshire. Julie Harris was cast by Wise who found her ideal for the psychologically fragile Eleanor, though during production she suffered from depression and had an uneasy relationship with her co-stars. The interior sets were by Elliot Scott, credited by Wise as instrumental in the making of The Haunting. They were designed to be brightly lit, with no dark corners or recesses, and decorated in a Rococo style; all the rooms had ceilings to create a claustrophobic effect on film. Numerous devices and tricks were used in the filming. Wise used a 30mm anamorphic, wide-angle lens Panavision camera that was not technically ready for use and caused distortions. It was only given to Wise on condition that he sign a memorandum in which he acknowledged that the lens was imperfect. Wise and cinematographer Davis Boulton planned sequences that kept the camera moving, utilizing low-angle takes, and incorporating unusual pans and tracking shots.|$|E

5|$|The Ordway Center for the Performing Arts hosts theater {{productions}} and the Minnesota Opera is {{a founding}} tenant. RiverCentre, attached to Xcel Energy Center, {{serves as the}} city's convention center. The city {{has contributed to the}} music of Minnesota and the Twin Cities music scene through various venues. Great jazz musicians have passed through the influential Artists' Quarter, first established in the 1970s in Whittier, Minneapolis, and moved to downtown Saint Paul in 1994. Artists' Quarter also hosts the Soapboxing Poetry Slam, home of the 2009 National Poetry Slam Champions. At The Black Dog, in Lowertown, many French or European jazz musicians (Evan Parker, Tony Hymas, Benoît Delbecq, François Corneloup...) have met Twin Cities musicians and started new groups touring in Europe. Groups and performers such as Fantastic Merlins, Dean Magraw/Davu Seru, Merciless <b>Ghosts,</b> <b>and</b> Willie Murphy are regulars. The Turf Club in Midway has been a music scene landmark since the 1940s. Saint Paul is also the home base of the internationally acclaimed Rose Ensemble. As an Irish stronghold, the city boasts popular Irish pubs with live music, such as Shamrocks, The Dubliner, and O'Gara's. The internationally acclaimed Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra is the nation's only full-time professional chamber orchestra. The Minnesota Centennial Showboat on the Mississippi River began in 1958 with Minnesota's first centennial celebration.|$|E
