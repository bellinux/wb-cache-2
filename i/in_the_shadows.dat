5|$|Petrol cans {{were stacked}} {{along the sides}} of {{existing}} revetted trenches near El Alamein railway station. It was found by experiment that when they were hidden <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadows</b> in that way, they were invisible from the air and so 2000 tons of petrol were thus stored.

5|$|The {{aspect of}} the {{colouring}} which was most unexpected was Michelangelo's treatment of shadows. The painting of the Libyan Sibyl and the Prophet Daniel, which are side-by-side, are exemplary. On the yellow dress of the Sibyl, Michelangelo has bright yellow highlights, passing through carefully graded tones of deeper yellow to pale orange, darker orange and almost to red <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadows.</b> While red shadows are of themselves unusual in a fresco, the gradation through adjacent parts of the spectrum is a natural enough solution. On Daniel's robes, {{there is no such}} gentle gradation. The yellow lining of his cloak becomes a sudden dense green <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadows,</b> while the mauve has shadows that are intensely red. These colour combinations, which are best described as iridescent, can be found at various places on the ceiling, including the hose of the young man in the Mathan lunette which is pale green and reddish purple.|$|E

5|$|The player's clan {{affects their}} skills and powers. Although the {{attractive}} Toreadors receive bonuses for seduction and persuasion, opening additional dialog options, they are physically weak; the Nosferatu are forced to travel <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadows</b> or through sewers to avoid alerting humans, but receive bonuses to their intelligence and computer skills, which enables access to more information. The Malkavians have separate dialog options, reflecting their inherent insanity. Upgrading some skills provides additional dialog options; attractive and charismatic characters seduce to get their way, aggressive characters threaten, and others persuade their targets to cooperate.|$|E
5|$|Within the tower, {{the champions}} defeat the Senator leader Lekain {{and destroy the}} blood pacts binding Daein and Kilvas. King Dheginsea of Goldoa also sides with Ashera and is killed by the champions. As they advance further into the tower, Micaiah begins to see visions of two men talking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadows</b> over many years. In one chamber of the tower, Ike and Zelgius duel for one last time, with Ike {{emerging}} victorious. Zelgius dies content that he has met a swordsman superior to himself.|$|E
5|$|After several line-up {{changes and}} self-made demos, Mercyful Fate {{released}} their self-titled EP in 1982, with the line-up of King Diamond (vocals), Hank Shermann (guitar), Michael Denner (guitar), Timi Hansen (bass) and Kim Ruzz (drums). With this line-up the group recorded {{their first two}} studio albums (1983's Melissa and 1984's Don't Break the Oath), until 1985 when the band broke up due to musical differences. In 1993, four out of the five members of Mercyful Fate reunited to record the album <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Shadows,</b> which was released the same year. During the 1990s, the band released four more studio albums and went through several line-up changes. Since 1999, Mercyful Fate have been on hiatus, but have reunited on occasion during the 2000s.|$|E

5|$|One night {{towards the}} end of 1942, Gröning and his comrades in their SS barracks on the {{outskirts}} of Birkenau were awakened by an alarm. They were told that a number of Jews who were being taken to the gas chambers had escaped and hidden in the woods. They were ordered to take pistols and search the woods. When his group arrived at the extermination area of the camp they saw a farmhouse, in front of which were SS men and the bodies of seven or eight prisoners who had been caught and shot. The SS men told Gröning and his comrades that they could go home but they decided to hang around <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadows</b> of the woods.|$|E
5|$|Ramza joins a {{mercenary}} group, led by Gafgarion, who protects Princess Ovelia {{from being}} hunted by both sides. Delita joins Prince Goltana's forces {{to rise up}} through the ranks and gain control over his own destiny. Ramza and Delita are reunited when Gafgarion attempts to take Ovelia to Prince Larg, though this proves futile. Agrias suggests visiting Cardinal Draclau of the Glabados Church to protect Ovelia, while Delita continues to work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadows,</b> working with multiple sides to realize his ambitions. Along the way to Lionel Castle, Ramza meets Mustadio, a machinist in possession of a holy relic called the Zodiac Stone. Hunted by a trading company for the power it contains, Mustadio also seeks Draclau's intervention.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} the boy throughout the game. As {{is typical of}} most two-dimensional platform games, the boy can run left or right, jump, climb onto short ledges or up and down ladders and ropes, and push or pull objects. Limbo is presented through dark, greyscale graphics and with minimalist ambient sounds, creating an eerie, haunting environment. The dark visuals also hide numerous environmental and physical hazards, such as deadly bear traps on the forest floor, or lethal monsters hiding <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadows,</b> such as a giant spider. Among the hazards are glowing worms, which attach themselves to the boy's head and force him to travel in only one direction until they are killed.|$|E

5|$|To help {{drive his}} points, Curtis uses {{interviews}} with various political and intellectual figures. In {{the first two}} parts, former Arms Control and Disarmament Agency member Anne Cahn and former American Spectator writer David Brock accuse the neoconservatives of knowingly using false evidence of wrongdoing in their campaigns against the Soviet Union and President Bill Clinton. Jason Burke, author of , comments <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Shadows</b> in the Cave on the failure to expose a massive terrorist network in Afghanistan. Additional interviews with major figures are added to drive the film's narrative. Neoconservatives William and Irving Kristol, Richard Pipes, Richard Perle and Michael Ledeen are invited to provide a neoconservative view of the film's subject. The history of Islamism is discussed by the Institute of Islamic Political Thought's Azzam Tamimi, political scientist Roxanne Euben, and Islamist Abdullah Anas.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} a game to include stealth gameplay, the {{knowledge}} of the artificial intelligence (AI) must be restricted to make it ignorant to parts of the game world. The AI in stealth games takes into specific consideration the enemies' reactions to the effects of the player's actions, such as turning off the lights, as opposed to merely reacting to the player directly. Enemies typically have a line of sight which the player can avoid by hiding behind objects, staying <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadows</b> or moving while the enemy is facing another direction. Enemies can also typically detect when the player touches them or moves within a small, fixed distance. Overall, stealth games vary in what player actions the AI will perceive and react to, with more recent games offering a wider range of enemy reactions. Often, the AI's movements are predictable and regular, allowing the player to devise a strategy to overcome his adversaries. Players are often given limited methods of engaging opponents directly in stealth games, either by restricting the player to ineffective or non-lethal weapons, equipping adversaries with far superior equipment and numbers, or providing the player with a limited amount of health that makes most combat scenarios extremely dangerous. Stealth games sometimes overlap with the survival horror genre, in which players are forced to hide from and evade supernatural or occasionally mundane enemies as they attempt to track down the player. Examples of hybrid stealth/horror games include , Outlast, and the Penumbra video game series.|$|E
5|$|The events {{depicted}} in Vampire: The Masquerade – Redemption occur in two time periods: 12th century Prague and Vienna, and late-20th century London and New York City. The game {{is set in}} the World of Darkness; it depicts a world in which vampires, werewolves, demons, and other creatures influence human history. The vampires are divided into seven Clans of the Camarilla—the vampire government—each with distinctive traits and abilities. The Toreadors are the closest to humanity—they have a passion for culture; the Ventrue are noble, powerful leaders; the Brujah are idealists who excel at fighting; the Malkavians are either cursed with insanity or blessed with insight; the Gangrel are loners in synchronization with their animalistic nature; the Tremere are secretive, untrustworthy, and wield blood magic; and the monstrous Nosferatu are condemned to remain hidden <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadows.</b> Redemption also features the Cappadocian clan; the Society of Leopold—modern-day vampire hunters; the Assamite clan of assassin vampires; the Setite clan; and the Sabbat—vampires who revel in their nature, embracing the beast within.|$|E

40|$|This paper first {{gives an}} {{explanation}} of the behaviour which motivates individuals to engage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> economy. It will be shown that people who fear being caught by tax authorities will be less likely to work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> economy and those who earn more money <b>in</b> <b>the</b> official economy will also work less <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> economy. <b>The</b> result of a logistic regression shows that if others are seen to be engaged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> economy then this increases subsequent demand for such activities. It was found that on average, a shadow economy worker earned AUS$ 2135. 31 during the year 2000, and households spent AUS$ 2, 293. 00 for these services. Using micro-data to calculate an overall aggregate figure for the estimated size of <b>the</b> <b>shadow</b> economy <b>in</b> Australia during <b>the</b> year 2000, it was found that between 4. 81 % and 8. 8 % of the gross national income (GNI) was earned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cash economy. ...|$|R
