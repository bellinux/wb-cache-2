[...] Her account of the break-up of the Tory party is a thoroughly partisan narration, accurate as to happenings outside the Tory inner circle, but on a broader scale and not so completely political as that of Henry Hobhouse.|$|E

North Carolina senator Jesse Helms offered his staff and funding from the Congressional Club, and wrote in his column that {{he was proud of}} Bryant: [...] "I have pledged my full support to her ... She is fighting for decency and morality in America—and that makes her, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>book,</b> an all-American lady". Pastor Jerry Falwell from Lynchburg, Virginia lent his support during visits and with the appearance of B. Larry Coy, who served as a marriage counselor to Bryant and Green. Coy and Green took over management of Bryant's ministries.|$|E

People behaved in an ugly and despicable fashion towards me. I felt no constraints. Nothing I did <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>book</b> is as mean as any of the people I wrote about." [...] She was {{similarly}} unrepentant about her subsequent expatriation, saying [...] "I wasn't a pariah because I was a drug-addicted, alcoholic, rotten person and not a good mother. I was a pariah because I hit them with a harsh, fluorescent light and rendered them as contemptible as they truly are." ...|$|E

500|$|The Wonderwall {{score was}} Harrison's first {{opportunity}} to compose extensively for a single project. He later described how he went about preparing the music: [...] "I had a regular wind-up stopwatch and I watched the film to 'spot-in' the music with the watch. I wrote the timings down <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>book,</b> then I'd go to , make up a piece, record it." [...] As with his songs for the Beatles over this period, including [...] "Within You Without You" [...] and [...] "Blue Jay Way", he composed mainly on keyboard instruments such as piano or organ, rather than guitar. In addition to the Indian pieces, Harrison wrote and arranged selections in Western musical styles. In some cases, these pieces were outlined to the musicians at the recording session by Harrison, on guitar, and they then improvised on his ideas. With other selections, he first made a demo, which the musicians followed.|$|E
500|$|Judas Priest's [...] "Dissident Aggressor" [...] is {{the first}} cover version to appear on a Slayer studio album. The song was chosen due to its war-themed lyrics. Hanneman {{described}} the track as [...] "more just {{like one of those}} odd songs {{that a lot of people}} didn't know, but it was a favorite of Kerry and I, so we just picked that one". Meanwhile, [...] "Cleanse the Soul" [...] has been heavily criticized by King who said that he hates the track: [...] "That's one of the black marks in our history, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>book.</b> I just fucking think it's horrible. [...] I hate the opening riff. It's what we call a 'happy riff.' It's just like 'la-lala-la-la-la.' I can't see myself playing it, but after that, where it gets heavier, I like that section. If we ever did a medley, I'd put part of that in there." [...] The Slayer boxset Soundtrack to the Apocalypse featured, along with four songs of the album, an early version of the title track, recorded at Hanneman's home.|$|E
500|$|Wario World {{received}} fairly positive reviews. The US {{version of}} Play magazine gave the game a perfect score, and the reviewer commented that Wario World [...] "pays off every second [...] holding the controller, and that, to , is greatness".

The American-based publication Game Informer praised the game for including [...] "droves of awesome boss battles". Matt Casamassina of IGN declared that Wario World had [...] "some great control mechanics and inventive level work". Electronic Gaming Monthlys Greg Ford said, [...] "Wario [...] delivers a great time while it lasts and is well worth checking out. Just don't expect a Mario-quality adventure". Worthplaying gave the game 9 out 10, stating that [...] "Treasure has done itself proud with this title, and Wario himself can lift his head up high. At least <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>book,</b> he's got at least one game that's better than Mario's." ...|$|E

500|$|Critics {{applauded the}} growing {{relationship}} between Andrea and Shane, {{as well as}} Dale's confrontation with Shane. Despite describing them as an [...] "unlikely pairing", Meslow asserted that it was superior to the storyline between Andrea and Dale. [...] "There's {{something to be said}} for the occasional post-apocalyptic tryst, which allows two characters who've experienced almost nothing but misery to have, even for a moment, something that resembles joy," [...] he articulated. Meslow retorted that it was wise to underplay the tryst between Shane and Andrea, which he predicted would not lead to anything serious. Venable wrote: [...] " [...] Dale’s lack of personality traits, beyond being the wise sage who gets in everyone’s business, makes him an unpredictable foe <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>book,</b> and could be as interesting as Shane’s violent selfishness." [...] Morgan Jeffrey of Digital Spy avouched that Shane continued to be an interesting character; [...] "Just as we were beginning to like him again, he murdered Otis in cold blood. And it seems like his downward spiral is set to continue—he's threatening poor Dale and embarking on an ill-advised affair with Andrea." ...|$|E

In May 2012, it was announced that the character had been rapidly aged again to a teenager, with Ehrich scheduled to join the cast. He made his debut on June 11, 2012. In an interview with Soap Opera Digest, Ehrich stated that he had gone through a [...] "long audition process", saying: [...] "I got a callback and did a chemistry read with someone, then came back to read with Christian LeBlanc. By the end of that audition, I knew something felt right and that he could be my father." [...] When asked about signing a contract with the series, Ehrich stated: [...] "I'm still on recurring right now. I think it's all relevant to your character and either way, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>book,</b> it's awesome. I would sign, yes, but it'll happen when the time is right." ...|$|E

500|$|IGN's Craig Harris {{awarded the}} game an Editor's Choice award, stating, [...] "This is an {{incredibly}} challenging, old-school throwback that might not set the genre afire with innovation, but <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>book,</b> it's better than the awesome game that inspired it. [...] Rare should be proud that its design is in the right hands. Or just insanely jealous. Either works." [...] Video game talk show Good Games two presenters gave the game a 9 and 8.5 out of 10, praising how true the music kept to {{the style of the}} original tracks, and that it managed to keep from becoming too complex while still avoiding being over-simplified, saying [...] "If you're a fan of the old Donkeys, or you just want a great platforming experience, this is worth {{at least as much as}} Kong's golden banana hoard." [...] X-Play praised the similarity of Returns to previous games in the series, the game's replay value, and its graphics, but the review criticized the motion controls [...] "that force you to react quickly at bad times, a button press would suffice" [...] and the co-op game play, saying, [...] "If your partner has a penchant for dying, look forward to some short games as he or she will most likely drain the number of lives you both share." [...] GamesRadar complimented the title for its standout levels and fan service, while criticizing it for levels that are [...] "frustrating, unclear and often misleading way that is unlike any prior Donkey Kong adventure", and motion controls that make them [...] "question the controls in a platformer". GameTrailers praised the game's gameplay and the diversity of the levels, while Giant Bomb claimed, [...] "Retro recaptures most of Donkey Kong's venerated platforming roots in this fine Wii sequel." ...|$|E
500|$|The musical {{covers and}} {{performances}} for the episode were mostly well received by critics and fans alike. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly stated that her favorite was [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] by Paul McCartney, {{performed by the}} Warblers. In {{a review of the}} performance, she wrote, [...] "This is much more Warbler-esque than 'When I Get You Alone'. I had also been worried we wouldn't get our weekly dose of dorky Warbler dance moves. Plus, major points for the blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment when Blaine sang the love 'won't come at all' line to Santana. It was probably my personal biggest laugh-out-loud moment of the episode." [...] She gave the performance an [...] "A". She also praised Puck's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls", and opined, [...] "In general, I'm in love with Mark Salling's voice. He's right up there with Artie [...] <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>book.</b> And this song was smothered in awesome sauce. Bonus points for Puck's sort-of-feminine head bob, Brittany's background groovin', the club's reactions to him singing to Lauren, and Mr. Schu's mild eye-roll." [...] She went on to give the performance an [...] "A−". Kristin Coachman of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer was a bit more critical of Puck's cover of the song: [...] "This week Mark Salling [...] is singing Queen's 'Fat Bottomed Girls'. I know this song fits in with Puck's storyline for the episode, but I feel like the song was in the wrong key for him. At times it sounded like he was straining to hit the higher notes. Because of this, I have to wonder if the backing vocals are purposely drowning his voice out. It seems depending on the song selection for him, Salling's vocal performances continue to be very hit or miss this season." ...|$|E
