40|$|Fuel {{saving and}} low carbon {{emission}} in shipping have already become an attractive and important subject in the shipping industry driven by the increasing full oil price and considerations of reduction of green house gas emission. Global shipping consumes 200 million tons of liquid fuel, resoluble for 1. 12 billion tons of CO 2 emission in the world. This paper presents {{the development of a}} novel forward dynamic programming method to optimise ship’s fuel consumption with respect to safety during a voyage. The constraints are weather, sea conditions and the safety constrains defined in the <b>IMO</b> guidance <b>MSC.</b> <b>1</b> /Circ. 1228. Compared with the traditional dynamic programming methods, the newly developed weather routing method is more accurate and practical. Simulation results from a case study have shown that the newly developed method is able to save several tons of fuel compared with that of the traditional methods for one North Atlantic voyage. As a result, it can offer much CO 2 emission reduction...|$|R
40|$|<b>Msc</b> <b>1,</b> {{a member}} of the Jarid 1 family of {{putative}} histone demethylases, is required for chromosome stability in fission yeast. <b>Msc</b> <b>1</b> associates with the Swr 1 complex that facilitates deposition of histone H 2 A. Z into chromatin. To assess the function of <b>Msc</b> <b>1</b> in the Swr 1 complex, domains of <b>Msc</b> <b>1</b> necessary for interaction with Swr 1 were identified. The C-terminal plant homeodomain (PHD) 2 and PHD 3 of <b>Msc</b> <b>1</b> are sufficient to confer association with Swr <b>1</b> and allow <b>Msc</b> <b>1</b> to function in the context of kinetochore mutants. On the other hand, a mutant with a single amino acid substitution in PHD 2 within the full-length <b>Msc</b> <b>1</b> protein retains the ability to bind to Swr 1 but eliminates the function of <b>Msc</b> <b>1</b> in combination with kinetochore mutants. Thus, Swr 1 association is critical but not sufficient for <b>Msc</b> <b>1</b> function. An activity of <b>Msc</b> <b>1</b> that depends on the cysteine residue within PHD 2 of <b>Msc</b> <b>1</b> is likewise critical for function.

We demonstrate that loss of <b>msc</b> <b>1</b> function results in an increased rate of chromosome loss and that an <b>msc</b> <b>1</b> null allele exhibits genetic interactions with mutants in key kinetochore components. Multicopy expression of <b>msc</b> <b>1</b> robustly suppresses a temperature-sensitive mutant (cnp 1 - 1) in the centromere-specific histone H 3 variant CENP-A, and localization of CENP-A to the centromere is compromised in <b>msc</b> <b>1</b> null cells. We present several lines of evidence to suggest that <b>Msc</b> <b>1</b> carries out its function through the histone H 2 A variant H 2 A. Z, encoded by pht 1 in fission yeast. Like an <b>msc</b> <b>1</b> mutant, a pht 1 mutant also exhibits chromosome instability and genetic interactions with kinetochore mutants. Suppression of cnp 1 - <b>1</b> by multicopy <b>msc</b> <b>1</b> requires pht 1. Likewise, suppression of the DNA damage sensitivity of a chk 1 mutant by multicopy <b>msc</b> <b>1</b> also requires pht 1. We present the first genetic evidence that histone H 2 A.

In a search for proteins that can improve the survival of Chk 1 -deficient cells exposed to DNA damage, we identified fission yeast <b>Msc</b> <b>1,</b> which is homologous to a mammalian protein that binds to the tumor suppressor Rb (RBP 2). <b>Msc</b> <b>1</b> and RBP 2 each possess three PHD fingers, domains commonly found in proteins that influence the structure of chromatin. <b>Msc</b> <b>1</b> is chromatin associated and coprecipitates a histone deacetylase activity, a property that requires the PHD fingers.

After MSC treatment, we also investigated the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which {{play a role in}} vascular and tissue remodeling. Human bone marrow-derived MSCs (2 × 10 (6), passage 5) were administrated intravenously after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats. First, we determined the time point of MSC transplantation that led to maximal neurological recovery at 1 h, 1 day, and 3 days after MCAO. Next, we measured activity of MMP- 2 and MMP- 9, neurological recovery, infarction volume, and vascular density after transplanting MSCs at the time that led to maximal neurological recovery. Among the MSC-transplanted rats, those of the <b>MSC</b> <b>1</b> -hour group showed maximal recovery in the rotarod test (P = 0. 023) and the Longa score (P = 0. 018). MMP- 2 activity at 1 day after MCAO in the <b>MSC</b> <b>1</b> -hour group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P = 0. 002), but MMP- 9 activity was not distinct. The <b>MSC</b> <b>1</b> -hour group also showed smaller infarction volume and higher vascular density than did the control group. In a permanent model of rodent MCAO, very early transplantation of human <b>MSCs</b> (<b>1</b> h after MCAO) produced greater neurological recovery and decreased infraction volume.

In this paper a Confidence Interval Convergence Test (CICT) method is presented that minimises the computational burden required to demonstrate that a model design has passed/failed by calculating a CI for the population 95 th percentile time, τP, rather than simply relying on τS determined from an arbitrary sample of 500 simulations as specified in the current guidelines. The CICT has comparable pass/fail accuracy to using 500 simulations whilst significantly {{reducing the number of}} simulations required when the PFCT is far from the τP.

Deletion of <b>Msc</b> <b>1</b> did not disrupt the S. pombe Swr 1 C or its ability to bind and load H 2 A. Z into euchromatin, however H 2 A. Z was ectopically found in the inner centromere and in subtelomeric chromatin. Normally this subtelomeric region not only lacks H 2 A. Z but also shows uniformly lower levels of H 3 K 4 me 2, H 4 K 5, and K 12 acetylation than euchromatin and disproportionately contains the most lowly expressed genes during vegetative growth, including many meiotic-specific genes. Genes within and adjacent to subtelomeric chromatin become overexpressed {{in the absence of}} either <b>Msc</b> <b>1,</b> Swr 1, or paradoxically H 2 A. Z itself. We also show that H 2 A. Z is N-terminally acetylated before, and lysine acetylated after, loading into chromatin and that it physically associates with the Nap 1 histone chaperone. However, we find a negative correlation between the genomic distributions of H 2 A. Z and Nap 1 /Hrp 1 /Hrp 3, suggesting that the Nap 1 chaperones remove H 2 A. Z from chromatin. These data describe H 2 A. Z action in S. pombe and identify a new mode of chromatin surveillance and maintenance based on negative regulation of histone variant misincorporation...|$|R
40|$|AIM: Basic {{fibroblast}} {{growth factor}} (bFGF) increases the migration and viability of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in vitro. Retrograde coronary venous infusion can provide both increased regional bFGF concentrations and homogeneous cell dissemination. We determined whether retrograde delivery of bFGF enhances {{the potency of}} transplanted MSCs for cardiac repair in a canine infarct model. METHODS AND RESULTS: Under hypoxic conditions, cellular migration was significantly increased in MSCs co-cultured with bFGF compared to vascular endothelial growth factor or insulin-like growth factor, and bFGF promoted MSCs differentiation into a cardiomyocyte phenotype. A canine infarct model was employed by coronary ligation. One week later, animals were subjected to retrograde infusion of combination bFGF (200 ng/mL) and <b>MSCs</b> (<b>1</b> × 10 (8) cells) (n= 5), <b>MSCs</b> (<b>1</b> × 10 (8) cells, n= 5), bFGF (200 ng/mL, n= 5), or placebo (phosphate-buffered saline, n= 3). Four weeks after infusion, only the bFGF+MSCs therapy exhibited significantly increased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by echocardiography (p CONCLUSIONS: Retrograde coronary venous bFGF infusion augments engraftment and differentiation capacity of transplanted MSCs, recovering cardiac function and preventing adverse remodeling. This novel combined treatment and delivery method is a promising strategy for cardiac repair after ischemic injury...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Our {{laboratory}} and others {{reported that the}} stimulation of specific Toll-like receptors (TLRs) affects the immune modulating responses of human multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs). Toll-like receptors recognize "danger" signals, and their activation leads to profound cellular and systemic responses that mobilize innate and adaptive host immune cells. The danger signals that trigger TLRs are released following most tissue pathologies. Since danger signals recruit immune cells to sites of injury, we reasoned that hMSCs might be recruited in a similar way. Indeed, we found that hMSCs express several TLRs (e. g., TLR 3 and TLR 4), and that their migration, invasion, and secretion of immune modulating factors is drastically affected by specific TLR-agonist engagement. In particular, we noted diverse consequences on the hMSCs following stimulation of TLR 3 when compared to TLR 4 by our low-level, short-term TLR-priming protocol. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we extend our studies on the effect on immune modulation by specific TLR-priming of hMSCs, and based on our findings, propose a new paradigm for hMSCs that takes its cue from the monocyte literature. Specifically, that hMSCs can be polarized by downstream TLR signaling into two homogenously acting phenotypes we classify here as <b>MSC</b> <b>1</b> and <b>MSC</b> 2. This concept came from our observations that TLR 4 -primed hMSCs, or <b>MSC</b> <b>1,</b> mostly elaborate pro-inflammatory mediators, while TLR 3 -primed hMSCs, or MSC 2, express mostly immunosuppressive ones. Additionally, allogeneic co-cultures of TLR-primed MSCs with {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) predictably lead to suppressed T-lymphocyte activation following MSC 2 co-culture, and permissive T-lymphocyte activation in co-culture with <b>MSC</b> <b>1.</b> SIGNIFICANCE: Our study provides an explanation to some of the conflicting reports on the net effect of TLR stimulation and its downstream consequences on the immune modulating properties of stem cells. We further suggest that MSC polarization provides a convenient way to render these heterogeneous preparations of cells more uniform while introducing a new facet to study, as well as provides an important aspect to consider for the improvement of current stem cell-based therapies...|$|R
40|$|A {{careful study}} of the {{accident}} reports reveals that 85 % of all accidents are either directly initiated by human error or are associated with human error by means of inappropriate human response (Ziarati, 2006). This {{is in line with}} the findings of a recent paper (IMO, 2005) that 80 % of accidents at sea are caused by human error. Turkish Government is also aware that collision is {{the most common type of}} accident in Turkey and this was again confirmed by the latest data published by the Main Search and Rescue Coordination Centre of Turkey in 2009. Collision amounted to 60 % of all accidents if grounding and contacts are included. The research shows that mistakes are usually made not because of deficient or inadequate regulations, but because the regulations and standards, that do exist, are often ignored. The <b>IMO</b> <b>MSC</b> (Ziarati, 2006) clearly indicates the causes of many of the accidents at sea are due to deficiencies in maritime education and training (MET) of seafarers or disregard for current standards and regulations. Ziarati also reports (2007) that majority of accidents and incidents are related to collisions or groundings. The International Regulations for Preventing collisions at Sea 1972 (Colregs) are rules to be followed by Deck/Navigation officers. It was initially designed to update the Collision Regulations of 1960 and entered into force in 1977. The last amendments were made in 2007. It is one of the most important International Conventions that all seagoing officers must have full knowledge of it before taking charge of a ship. How...|$|R

Adult bone marrow multipotential stromal cells (MSCs) hold great promise in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. However, due to their low numbers upon harvesting, MSCs need to be expanded in vitro without biasing future differentiation for optimal utility. In this concept paper, {{we focus on the}} potential use of epidermal growth factor (EGF), prototypal growth factor for enhancing the harvesting and/or differentiation of MSCs. Soluble EGF was shown to augment MSC proliferation while preserving early progenitors within MSC population, and thus did not induce differentiation. However, tethered form of EGF was shown to promote osteogenic differentiation. Soluble EGF was also shown to increase paracrine secretions including VEGF and HGF from MSC. Thus, soluble EGF can be used not only to expand MSC in vitro, but also to enhance paracrine secretion through drugreleasing MSC-encapsulated scaffolds in vivo. Tethered EGF can also be utilized to direct MSC towards osteogenic lineage both in vitro and in vivo. 1.
