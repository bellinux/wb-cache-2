5|$|Although {{the species}} is widely {{regarded}} as sexually monomorphic, males have been suggested to <b>grow</b> <b>more</b> quickly, and in some naturally occurring strains, males are noted to possess dark blotches on the base of their dorsal fins. The species reaches sexual maturity around one year of age, and continues to reproduce for 9–10 years. Frequency and timing of spawning {{may be related to the}} occurrence of rain. A. ocellatus fish are biparental substrate spawners, though detailed information regarding their reproduction in the wild is scarce.|$|E

As her battles <b>grow</b> <b>more</b> desperate and more people she cares for fall victim to the Elder Bairns, Saya begins finding faults in her reality, and eventually uncovers a disturbing truth about herself, the town and her surviving friends.|$|E
5|$|From 1881 on, Pedro II's health began failing. He {{gradually}} {{withdrew from}} public affairs as time passed. Weary of being {{tied to a}} throne which he doubted would survive his death, he persevered out of duty and because there seemed no immediate alternative. Nor did his daughter and heir, Isabel, exhibit a desire to assume the crown. Both, however, were overwhelmingly beloved by the Brazilian people, who still supported the monarchy. The indifference towards the Imperial system by the Emperor and his daughter allowed a discontented republican minority to <b>grow</b> <b>more</b> audacious and to eventually launch the coup that overthrew the Empire.|$|E

5|$|A 2002 study {{conducted}} by CARE International across three districts in the Central Region of Malawi considers how HIV/AIDS has affected economic well-being in rural Malawi. When skilled laborers are infected with HIV, they are usually unable to work; therefore, they often shift agricultural production on their land to less labor-intensive crops, sacrificing the opportunity to <b>grow</b> <b>more</b> profitable, labor-intensive crops such as tobacco. When family members fall ill with HIV/AIDS, their relatives invest time in their treatment and care, further reducing household productivity. In addition, when family members are infected with HIV, households often use the money they would normally invest in agriculture to cover medical expenses, further decreasing economic stability at the household level. Finally, when adults contract HIV, their children often remain home from school {{to work in the}} fields, threatening long-term productivity and economic advancement in Malawi.|$|E
5|$|Father John {{returns to}} the red-light {{district}} and speaks to a prostitute named Miriam (Greta Oglesby), who suggests a powerful pimp named James St. Clair (Ansa Akyea) might know about the woman. As they speak in a bar, the mysterious prostitute enters and solicits a john (Patrick Coyle), who leaves with her immediately. As she goes, Father John catches {{a glimpse of the}} crucifix she is wearing and tries to chase her down. She leaves in the john's car before he can catch them, but he writes down the license plate as they drive off. Back at church, his sermons start to <b>grow</b> <b>more</b> unorthodox, and Father Ralph warns him that his unusual church manner and trips to the red-light district have the archbishop concerned. Meanwhile, Father John is contacted by his ex-girlfriend Nadine Brennan (Amy Matthews), who tells him she is divorcing her husband and still harbors romantic feelings for Father John.|$|E
5|$|The calf nurses {{for three}} years, {{although}} lactation usually lasts longer, allowing for extensive mother-calf bonds. Short-finned pilot whale females will go though menopause, {{but this is}} not as common in females of long-finned pilot whales. Postreproductive females possibly play important roles in the survival of the young. Postreproductive females will continue to lactate and nurse young. Since they can no longer bear young of their own, these females invest in the current young. Short-finned pilot whales <b>grow</b> <b>more</b> slowly than long-finned pilot whales. For the short-finned pilot whale, females become sexually mature at 9 years old and males at about 13–16 years. For the long-finned pilot whale, females reach maturity at around eight years and males at around 12 years.|$|E

5|$|After {{exploring}} Daybreak Town and defeating several Heartless, {{the player}} is approached by the Foreteller, who tells them that defeating weaker Heartless {{is possible to}} do alone, but they will need others help to defeat more powerful opponents. The Foreteller also describes how many others are collecting light as well, though some may secretly be doing so to gain power instead of fighting the darkness, and the player must decide who to trust. Chirithy then encourages the player to explore other worlds and help rid them of the Heartless {{before it is too}} late. The player then visits the illusion future visions of Disney worlds, where they interact with the locals and help defeat the hordes of Heartless. The player is brought to each world under Chirithy's direction, and together the two search for the origin of the darkness. As the player succeeds in defeating the forces of evil, Chirithy begins to reveal the full extent of his knowledge regarding the war between light and darkness. Chirithy remembers being born in a place of light, with his creator smiling upon him in the beginning. The creator would later vanish, but before doing so he renamed six of his followers and gave five of them a prophecy of the future. The five, later known as the Foretellers, were shocked to discover that the future ended with a great battle in which the light would be defeated and the eternal reign of darkness would begin. To save the future, the Foretellers began to use the hidden powers within the written copy of the prophecy known as the Book of Prophecies (which creates the future worlds that the players travel to). Through this book, the Foretellers projected the future into their era to <b>grow</b> <b>more</b> powerful and save the light from final defeat. The power retrieved from the future is manifested as the Cards the player gathers to grow stronger.|$|E
