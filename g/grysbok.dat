5|$|A carnivore, the caracal {{typically}} preys upon small mammals, {{birds and}} rodents. Studies in South Africa {{have reported that}} it preys on the Cape <b>grysbok,</b> the common duiker, sheep, goats, bush vlei rats, rock hyraxes, hare and birds. A study in western India showed that rodents comprise {{a significant portion of}} the diet. They will feed from a variety of sources, but tend to focus on the most abundant one. Grasses and grapes are taken occasionally to clear their immune system and stomach of any parasites. Larger antelopes such as young kudu, bushbuck, impala, mountain reedbuck and springbok may also be targeted. Mammals generally comprise at least 80 percent of the diet. Lizards, snakes and insects are infrequently eaten. They are notorious for attacking livestock, but rarely attack humans.|$|E
25|$|Elephant are faring {{increasingly}} {{well and}} several breeding herds and bachelor bulls traverse {{the park and}} the surrounding game management area. Several of the plains like Chikufwe are home to common reedbuck, buffalo, sable antelope and Lichtenstein's hartebeest, which are often encountered in the dry season. A small population of plains zebra occurs in the park. Roan antelope, defassa waterbuck and Sharpe's <b>grysbok</b> occur but are rare and seldom seen, whereas warthog numbers are increasing and they are commonly sighted. Yellow-backed Duiker and Moloney’s monkey, which are poached elsewhere, have also got a steady increase in {{the population in the}} park.|$|E
500|$|Most bovids are diurnal, {{although}} a few such as the buffalo, bushbuck, reedbuck, and <b>grysbok</b> are exceptions. Social activity and feeding usually peak during dawn and dusk. The bovids usually rest before dawn, during midday, and after dark. Grooming is usually by licking with the tongue. Rarely do antelopes roll in mud or dust. Wildebeest and buffalo usually wallow in mud, whereas the hartebeest and topi rub their heads and horns in mud and then smear it over their bodies. Bovids use different forms of vocal, olfactory, and tangible communication. These involve varied postures of neck, head, horns, hair, legs, and ears to convey sexual excitement, emotional state, or alarm. One such expression is the flehmen response. Bovids usually stand motionless, with the head high and an intent stare, when they sense danger. Some like the impala, kudu, and eland can even leap to heights of a few feet. Bovids may roar or grunt to caution others and warn off predators. [...] Bovids such as gazelles stot or pronk in response to predators, making high leaps on stiff legs, indicating honestly both that the predator has been seen, and that the stotting individual is strong and not worth chasing.|$|E
50|$|The {{predominant}} wildlife {{species in}} Rungwa Game Reserve are: lions, leopards, Cape buffaloes, elands, sables, nibbles, Greater kudus, <b>grysboks,</b> klipspringers, oribis, hartebeests, liechtensteins, impala, zebras, hippopotami, crocodiles and bush pigs. The reserve provides the excellent habitation for lion and hyena. It is regarded to have largest concentration of bird species feeding themselves in Usangu valley.|$|R
50|$|Kafue has {{a superb}} range of antelopes {{as well as}} large herds of red lechwe and puku, with smaller groups of zebras and blue {{wildebeest}} in the Busanga Plains around June, when it starts to dry out. Across the northern half of the park, there's a good range of mixed bush environments. Kudus, bushbucks, elands, reedbucks, duikers, <b>grysboks</b> and defassa waterbucks are all frequently seen in Kafue. Lions are relatively widespread all over the park, but the larger males are increasingly uncommon, with inevitable consequences for numbers as a whole. Prides stalk through nervous herds of pukus and lechwes nightly, using the natural drainage ditches for cover with deadly efficiency on the Busanga Plains. The Kafue River and its tributaries themselves are a hive of activity and home to pods of hippopotami {{and a few of}} the largest crocodiles in southern Africa. Elephants are commonly seen particularly along the Kafue River and around Lake Itezhi-tezhi. Leopards remain very common throughout the main forested areas of this park, though they are seldom seen on the open plains. Spotted hyenas are seen regularly, though not often, throughout the park. Cheetahs are not common anywhere, but they are most frequently seen in the north of this park, where they seem to be thriving. Occasional sightings of Cape wild dogs occur all over the park which is one of Zambia's best strongholds for them.|$|R
50|$|Sharpe's <b>grysbok</b> browse on leaves, buds, herb and fruits—in the dry season, {{their food}} is {{typically}} tough (for which their teeth and jaws are adapted). Grazed grass makes up about 30% of their diet. Like the Cape <b>grysbok</b> {{they use a}} communal latrine and mark sticks in its vicinity with pre-orbital gland secretions.|$|E
5000|$|Sharpe's <b>grysbok</b> (Raphicerus sharpei) — a small shy solitary {{antelope}} {{similar to}} a duiker, quite common ...|$|E
50|$|The Cape <b>grysbok</b> is {{probably}} territorial as sightings are mostly of individual animals. It is a browser. It can apparently go without drinking water for long periods, gaining {{most of its}} requirements from its food. It is primarily nocturnal, {{though it may be}} seen during early morning and late evening during the southern winter. Like Sharpe's <b>grysbok</b> they use a communal latrine and mark plants in its vicinity with secretions from their pre-orbital glands.|$|E
50|$|The Sharpe's or {{northern}} <b>grysbok</b> (Raphicerus sharpei) is a small, shy, solitary antelope that {{is found}} from tropical to south-eastern Africa.|$|E
50|$|The {{closely related}} Cape (or southern) <b>grysbok</b> (R. melanotis) {{occurs in the}} western Cape region. Haltenorth and Diller {{consider}} R. sharpei as a subspecies of R. melanotis.|$|E
50|$|The Cape or {{southern}} <b>grysbok</b> (Raphicerus melanotis) {{is a small}} antelope that is {{endemic to}} the Western Cape region of South Africa between Albany and the Cederberg mountains.|$|E
50|$|Animals {{that can}} be found here include a group of tame leopard, caracal, grey duiker, Cape <b>grysbok,</b> steenbok, mongoose, {{angulate}} and padloper tortoises and over 170 species of bird.|$|E
50|$|Smaller mammals {{are still}} {{found in the}} park: caracal, rock hyrax {{and a variety of}} small {{antelope}} species, such as the Cape <b>grysbok</b> and notably the recently re-introduced klipspringer.|$|E
50|$|Small rodents, in {{particular}} Otomys and Rhabdomys, are {{their most important}} dietary component. On occasion, immature hares or the young of small antelopes such as Cape <b>grysbok</b> may be attacked.|$|E
5000|$|The similar Sharpe's <b>grysbok</b> (Raphicerus sharpei) can {{be found}} in {{south-eastern}} Africa. The primary physical difference between the two grysboks is that Sharpe's has a pair of [...] "false hooves" [...] above the fetlocks.|$|E
5000|$|Although its {{territorial}} {{range is}} large, Sharpe's <b>grysbok</b> is infrequently seen. Males and females seem to form brief associations, but {{the species is}} usually encountered singly. Territory is marked with dung middens. Their habitat is rocky hill country, but preferring fertile zones on the lower slopes. They are nocturnal browsers and spend {{the day in the}} protective cover of tall grass or shrubs. They are extremely timid and will run away {{at the first sign of}} anything unusual, although this flight is accompanied [...] "short stamping hops"; they move well away from where the disturbance occurred before stopping (unlike steenbok, which stop and look back). Sharpe's <b>Grysbok</b> are reported to take refuge in aardvark burrows, like steenbok.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{than the}} large numbers of Cape Mountain Zebra, other large mammals include leopard, caracal, aardwolf, black-backed jackal, hartebeest, <b>grysbok,</b> and a wide range of other {{antelope}} species. The reserve is also home to an unusually large range of reptile and bird species.|$|E
5000|$|It has a rough, reddish sandy coat flecked in white. The head, {{neck and}} legs are less flecked and {{somewhat}} yellowish, while {{the inside of}} the ears, eye-rings, mouth area, throat and underside are white. There is a black [...] "bridge" [...] to the nose and a dark scent gland in front of the eye. It stands only 21" [...] (45-55 cm) at the shoulder and weighs slightly more than 20 pounds (8-12 kg). The short tail of the Cape <b>grysbok</b> measures 4 to 8 cm and is almost invisible. Males have short, sharp and straight horns about 8 cm long, which are smooth. The Cape <b>grysbok</b> can fluff out the fur at its rear end to make itself look bigger.|$|E
50|$|Other {{indigenous}} {{species in the}} park include the African clawless otter, Stanley's bustard, Secretary bird and the Blue crane, South Africa's national bird. Grey Rhebok, Cape <b>Grysbok,</b> Duiker, Red Hartebeest and Cape Mountain Zebra {{can also be found}} here. There are over 200 species of birds.|$|E
50|$|South Africa {{has many}} {{antelope}} species, some which are widespread and {{are well known}} {{in other parts of}} the world, and some that are endemic. There is an extinct species of antelope endemic to South Africa known as the bluebuck. Several antelopes are found in different habitats. Species such as the gemsbok are found in arid areas, the black wildebeest (an endemic species) in grasslands, the Cape <b>grysbok</b> in fynbos, the impala in savanna and the klipspringer in rocky terrain. Other species range in a wider variety of habitats, such as the Springbok in arid shrublands, semidesert and grassland, and the Greater Kudu in thicket, open woodlands and riverine vegetation. South Africa has a wealth of small antelope species, such as the aforementioned klipspringer and Cape <b>grysbok,</b> common duiker, blue duiker, steenbok and oribi.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, a few leather {{artifacts}} {{were found}} in the main bedding. Only one fully reconstructible garment was found: a pull-through made of <b>grysbok</b> (antelope) leather, similar to those worn by present-day hunter-gatherer groups in South Africa. The remaining leather artifacts were small pieces of skin, some sewn, mostly from small antelope.|$|E
50|$|Animal {{bones were}} found in all layers, but were better {{preserved}} in the higher layers. The faunal remains found {{for the most part}} belonged to species currently found in the region such as bushpig, <b>grysbok,</b> bushbuck, and duiker, all of which require or prefer a habitat with dense vegetation. Faunal remains of some species from nearby areas, including Kudu, rooi ribbok, vaal ribbok, cape buffalo, baboon, and vervet monkey; and some extinct species, including blue antelope and mountain zebra, were also found. The faunal remains as a whole are indicative of a hunting pattern that has been associated with the tools of the Wilton Industry - the hunting of smaller, nocturnal, non-herd animals such as <b>grysbok,</b> bushbuck, and kudu, which appear to have been the main prey of the residents of Melkhoutboom. It is thought that such a pattern might indicate hunting with snares rather than with spears or other projectiles.|$|E
5000|$|The Cape grysbok's native {{habitat is}} the [...] "Fynbos biome" [...] (Cape Floristic Region), and it inhabits thick shrubland. It can {{sometimes}} be found browsing orchards and vineyards. In the Cape Peninsula the <b>grysbok</b> {{can be found in}} urban edges close to human activity. It may also be found in reed beds and along the riverbed of the southern Karoo.|$|E
50|$|Wildlife {{such as the}} {{formerly}} endangered bontebok and Cape mountain zebra inhabit the area. Other species include bushbuck, klipspringer, grey rhebuck, Cape <b>grysbok,</b> baboon, mongoose, genet and the occasional leopard, {{as well as a}} species of ghost frog and a unique forest emperor butterfly. Over 200 bird species found near the town include waterfowl, the crowned eagle, black eagle, Narina trogon, paradise flycatcher and the Knysna woodpecker.|$|E
50|$|The Cape of Good Hope {{section of}} Table Mountain National Park {{is home to}} several species of antelope. Bontebok and eland are easily seen, and red {{hartebeest}} {{can be seen in}} the grazing lawns in Smitswinkel Flats. Grey rhebok are less commonly seen and are scarce, but may be observed along the beach hills at Olifantsbos. Most visitors are unlikely to ever see either Cape <b>grysbok</b> or klipspringer.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two small}} {{wetlands}} in the area, but during winter several more small temporary wetlands develop, providing habitat {{for more than}} 70 bird species. At least 10 species of butterflies and moths have been recorded. There was a small population of steenbok, but they have disappeared from the area. There is however still a population of <b>grysbok</b> in both {{the northern and southern}} parts of the reserve.|$|E
50|$|Many {{antelope}} {{are sexually}} dimorphic. In most species, both sexes have horns, {{but those of}} males tend to be larger. Males tend to be larger than the females, but exceptions in which the females tend to be heavier than the males include the bush duiker, dwarf antelope, Cape <b>grysbok,</b> and oribi, all rather small species. A number of species have hornless females (e.g. sitatunga, red lechwe, and suni). In some species, the males and females have differently coloured pelages (e.g. blackbuck and nyala).|$|E
50|$|Black rhino, {{elephants}} and buffalo inhabit the park. Other species include night ape, honey badger, civet, small spotted genet, slender mongoose, banded mongoose, spotted hyaena, wild cat, lion, leopard, yellow spotted dassie, black rhinoceros, zebra, warthog, common duiker, <b>grysbok,</b> klipspringer, waterbuck, bushbuck, scrub hare, porcupine, vervet monkey, chacma baboon, side-striped jackal, hippopotamus, roan antelope, kudu and bush squirrel, African clawless otter, white-tailed mongoose, reedbuck, sable antelope, eland, civet, rusty spotted genet, caracal and bush pig; sighted on rarely are wild dog, cheetah, roan and pangolin.|$|E
50|$|Birds in {{this area}} include black goshawk, black-headed oriole and two species which are almost endemic to the Cape area, the orange-breasted sunbird and Cape siskin. There is one near-endemic mammal Duthie's golden mole (Chlorotalpat duthieae) and in the inland valleys, Addo Elephant National Park is home to {{elephant}} (Loxodonta africana), black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) and antelopes such as bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus), grey rhebok (Pelea capreolus), mountain reedbuck (Redunca fulvorufula), common eland (Taurotragus oryx), greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), red hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus), Cape <b>grysbok</b> (Raphicerus melanotis) and common duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia).|$|E
50|$|The {{conservation}} area {{consists of two}} priority nature sites, the Silwerstroomstrand Conservation Area and the Atlantis Dunefields. They protect a patch of Atlantis Sand Fynbos vegetation type, as well as Cape Flats Dune Strandveld. Both vegetation types are endangered. The local landscape consists of sandy beaches, rocky shorelines and outcrops, as well as mobile dunes. Among the many animals {{that can be found}} in this reserve is the globally threatened black harrier, the caracal, the steenbok, the Cape <b>grysbok</b> {{and a variety of other}} mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is similar}} in size to the gray duiker, but has a stockier body and {{elongated}} fur over the hindquarters. It stands about 20" [...] (45-60 cm) at the shoulders and weighs only 7-11.5 kg. Its coat is reddish-brown which is streaked with white; eye-rings, around mouth, throat and underside are off-white. The males have stubby horns, which are widely spaced. Sharpe's <b>grysbok</b> has a short deep muzzle with large mouth and heavy molar (grinding) teeth. The short neck and face on a long-legged body result in a high-rump posture when browsing.|$|E
50|$|Elephant are faring {{increasingly}} {{well and}} several breeding herds and bachelor bulls traverse {{the park and}} the surrounding game management area. Several of the plains like Chikufwe are home to common reedbuck, buffalo, sable antelope and Lichtenstein's hartebeest, which are often encountered in the dry season.

Yellow-backed Duiker and Moloney’s monkey, which are poached elsewhere, have also got a steady increase in {{the population in the}} park.|$|E
50|$|Animal remains {{include those}} of mammals, {{tortoises}} and intertidal marine shells. Most bones {{found in the}} cave come from rock hyrax, hares, cape dune mole-rats, steenbok and <b>grysbok.</b> Animals from rocky environments are also found including klipspringer, and vaalribbok. There is also evidence of local grasslands, with remains of zebras, wildebeest and hartebeest. Hippopotamus and southern reedbuck came from the local river. The sea coast seems to have moved up the river, as there are fragments from black mussels, granite limpets, and Cape fur seals. Though there are ostrich-shell remains, no ostrich bones have been found.|$|E
50|$|Mammals {{found in}} Botswana include aardwolf, African buffalo, African bush elephant, African civet, African golden cat, African leopard, African striped weasel, Angolan giraffe, banded mongoose, bat-eared fox, black-footed cat, blue duiker, bongo (antelope), brown hyena, Burchell's zebra, bushbuck, Cape fox, Cape hyrax, Cape wild dog, caracal, common duiker, common eland, gemsbok, giant sable antelope, greater kudu, ground pangolin, hartebeest, hippopotamus, impala, kirk's dik-dik, klipspringer, lechwe, marsh mongoose, meerkat, {{mountain}} zebra, oribi, roan antelope, sable antelope, serval, sharpe's <b>grysbok,</b> sitatunga, southern reedbuck, South African cheetah, South African giraffe, south-central black rhinoceros, Southwest African lion, spotted hyena, springbok antelope, steenbok, topi, Transvaal lion, warthog, waterbuck, wildebeest, yellow mongoose and yellow-backed duiker.|$|E
50|$|A carnivore, the caracal {{typically}} preys upon small mammals, {{birds and}} rodents. Studies in South Africa {{have reported that}} it preys on the Cape <b>grysbok,</b> the common duiker, sheep, goats, bush vlei rats, rock hyraxes, hare and birds. A study in western India showed that rodents comprise {{a significant portion of}} the diet. They will feed from a variety of sources, but tend to focus on the most abundant one. Grasses and grapes are taken occasionally to clear their immune system and stomach of any parasites.

Lizards, snakes and insects are infrequently eaten. They are notorious for attacking livestock, but rarely attack humans.|$|E
50|$|Many {{different}} microclimates occur, so {{the flora}} changes from west to east, and also varies with altitude up the hillsides {{away from the}} coast and according to compass direction. Lower elevations are covered with protea fynbos, with ericas taking over further up. Plant species include pincushions (Leucospermum). The wildlife includes a number of endemic bees, beetles, horseflies, and ants, and birds such as Cape sugarbirds and the orange-breasted sunbird. Many of these birds and insects are important and specific pollinators for the fynbos, such as the mountain pride butterfly (Aeropetes tulbaghia) which only visits red flowers such as Disa uniflora and pollinates 15 different species. Larger animals include antelopes, particularly Cape <b>grysbok</b> (Raphicerus melanotis), common duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia), and klipspringer (Oreotragus oreotragus). The extinct blue antelope and quagga were also fynbos natives.|$|E
