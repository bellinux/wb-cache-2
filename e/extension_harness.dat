50|$|Pump Mounted Driver: Relates to thermal failures. The PMD is screwed to the DS-4 {{injection}} pump on the 1994-2001 GM 6.5 diesel utilizing fuel flow to dissipate heat. The {{injection pump}} is {{mounted in the}} intake valley (a high heat area). The PMD contains two power transistors that should be cooled by proper contact with the injection pump body. If the pump is not precisely machined to make complete contact with the transistors via the silicone thermal gasket and paste, the PMD is improperly installed without the gasket or paste, the PMD is installed off center with the pump body, or corrosion develops on the mounting surface the PMD will overheat. Several companies manufacture an <b>extension</b> <b>harness</b> and heat-sink kits. These allow an owner or their mechanic to relocate the PMD away from the injection pump to a lower heat environment and/or a place that can get more air flow.|$|E
40|$|AbstractContempoary {{research}} on the {{soil and water conservation}} benefit mainly focus on the benefit calculation after a certain harnessing stage. However, little was known about how the harnessing messures affect the runoff and sediment during the harnessing process. This paper takes Lianshui watershed as the research object to analyze 32 years’ monitoring data of the outlet station in this watershed by virtue of Mann-Kendall Test and calculate quantificationally the contribution of long-term soil and water conservation measures harnessing to the runoff and sediment yield of this watershed in different stages by virtue of mathematical model, thus to identify the influence on long-term long-scale soil and water conservation measures harnessing on runoff and sediment yield variation. The results have showed that: After the 3 soil and water conservation harnessing stages during the period from 1983 to 2002, the sediment yield of Lianshui watershed has significantly decreased, however, the annual runoff hasn’t been changed along with the <b>extension</b> of the <b>harnessing</b> period, with regard to the influence on sediment reduction in the watershed, the contribution rate of water and soil conservation measures was 41. 41 % compared with the natural factors after 1 st harnessing stage (1991 - 1998), 49. 74 % after 2 nd harnessing stage (1999 - 2002), and in 3 rd harnessing stage (2003 - 2009) it reached 67. 68 %, {{it can be seen that}} the influence of water and soil conservation measures on watershed sediment yield can gradually increase along with the <b>extension</b> of <b>harnessing</b> period and continuous expansion of harnessing scale and eventually become the dominant factor...|$|R

On 27 November 2015, he joined National League club Aldershot Town on a five-week loan. However he made just two {{substitute}} appearances for Barry Smith's [...] "Shots" [...] during his spell at the Recreation Ground. He {{went on to}} make five substitute appearances for Burton as the club achieved promotion out of League One and he [...] "impressed with his pace and direct running" [...] during these games and was named as Burton's 'Most Improved Young Player' for the 2015-16 season, after which his contract was extended for a further year. He played ten Championship matches in the 2016-17 season, and Albion took up a one-year <b>extension</b> to <b>Harness's</b> contract in May 2017.|$|R
30|$|The {{present study}} {{established}} a human tumour xenograft cancer model with modifiable vascularisation and successfully evaluated parameters reflecting vascularisation in tumours by noninvasive clinical imaging. Results {{were correlated with}} histology and immunohistology. The amount of necrosis and the pathologic tumour vasculature in tumours were visualised using clinical scanners and were correlated with histological results. The {{results of the study}} showed that DWI is capable of assessing information not only on cell density but also indirectly on the vascularisation in tumours. The differentiated observation of DWI parameters increased the information obtainable from imaging and provide additional parameters that can be introduced to large-data analysis. ADCdiff should be interpreted in its minimal, mean and maximal <b>extension.</b> The <b>harness</b> of established clinical methods (DWI, CE-CT, TOF) may by expanded by a better understanding of these imaging parameters. The results of this study could contribute to this. This may give more information concerning the aggressiveness of tumours, which may influence therapy [4, 32, 33]. Additionally, this study showed that clinical imaging units may well be used for preclinical imaging, which allows faster translation of results.|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} years metacomputing systems {{have proved to}} be capable of {{coalescing}} computational power in the order of magnitude of supercomputers without requiring to acquire costly specialized hardware. In fact, they showed their capability to conglomerate heterogeneous computational nodes over a geographically distributed area and to allow creating high performance workbenches for computationally challenging applications. Among these systems, HARNESS presents the unique feature of being based on the principles of dynamic reconfigurability and extensible distributed virtual machines. Unfortunately, the original HARNESS system requires that all the nodes accessing the services are part of the virtual machine thus preventing thin-client access to virtual machine provided services. In this paper we describe how we developed an <b>extension</b> to the <b>HARNESS</b> system capable of allowing web-based access to virtual machines and how we used our system to create a virtual simulation laboratory...|$|R
40|$|Conditioning the {{proboscis}} <b>extension</b> reflex of <b>harnessed</b> honeybees (Apis mellifera) is used {{to study}} the effect temporal spacing between successive conditioning trials has on memory. Retention is monitored at two long-term intervals corresponding to early (1 and 2 d after conditioning) and late long-term memory (3 and 4 d). The acquisition level is varied by using different conditioned stimuli (odors, mechanical stimulation, and temperature increase at the antenna), varying strengths of the unconditioned stimulus (sucrose), and various numbers of conditioning trials. How learning trials are spaced is the dominant factor both for acquisition and retention, and although longer intertrial intervals lead to better acquisition and higher retention, the level of acquisition per se does not determine the spacing effect on retention. Rather, spaced conditioning leads to higher memory consolidation both during acquisition and later, between the early and long-term memory phases. These consolidation processes can be selectively inhibited by blocking protein synthesis during acquisition. Learning trials distributed over time lead to better memory than learning trials squeezed into short periods of time. Jost (1897), who elaborated on the original findings by Ebbing-haus (1885), {{was the first to}} formulate a theory supposing...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} assess how {{emerging}} science and new tools {{can be applied to}} study multiple stressors on a large (ecosystem) scale and to facilitate greater integration of approaches among different scientific disciplines, a workshop was held on 10 - 12 September 2014 at the Sydney Institute of Marine Sciences, Sydney, Australia. This workshop aimed to explore the potential offered by new approaches to characterise stressor regimes, to explore stressor-response relationships among biota, to design better early-warning systems and to develop smart tools to support sustainable management of human activities, through more efficient regulation. In this paper we highlight the key issues regarding biological coverage, the complexity of multiply stressed environments, and our inability to predict the biological effects under such scenarios. To address these challenges, we provide an extension of the current Environmental Risk Assessment framework. Underpinning this <b>extension</b> is the <b>harnessing</b> of environmental-genomic data, which has the capacity to provide a broader view of diversity, and to express the ramifications of multiple stressors across multiple levels of biological organisation. We continue to consider how these and other emerging data sources may be combined and analysed using new statistical approaches for disentangling the effects of multiple stressors. 15 page(s...|$|R
