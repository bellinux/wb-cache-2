40|$|Combined {{deficiency}} of factor V and factor VIII (F 5 F 8 D) is a bleeding disorder caused by mutations in either LMAN 1 or MCFD 2. LMAN 1 (ERGIC- 53) and MCFD 2 form a Ca 2 +-dependent cargo receptor that cycles between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment for efficient transport of FV/FVIII from the ER to the Golgi. Here {{we show that}} the C-terminal EF-hand domains are both necessary and sufficient for MCFD 2 to interact with LMAN 1. MCFD 2 with a deletion of the entire N-terminal non-EF hand region still retains the LMAN 1 -binding function. Deletions that disrupt core structure of the EF-hand domains abolish LMAN 1 binding. Circular dichroism spectroscopy studies on missense mutations localized to different structural elements of the EF-hand domains suggest that Ca 2 +-induced folding is important for LMAN 1 interaction. The EF-hand domains also mediate the interaction with FV and FVIII. However, mutations in MCFD 2 that disrupt the tertiary structure and abolish LMAN 1 binding still retain the FV/FVIII binding activities, suggesting that this interaction is independent of Ca 2 +-induced folding of the protein.

The P 4 -ATPases Drs 2 p and Dnf 1 p cycle between the exocytic and endocytic pathways, {{and here we}} define endocytosis signals required by these proteins to maintain a steady-state localization to internal organelles. Internalization of Dnf 1 p from the plasma membrane uses an NPFXD endocytosis signal and its recognition by Sla 1 p, part of an endocytic coat/adaptor complex with clathrin, Pan 1 p, Sla 2 p/End 4 p, and End 3 p. Drs 2 p has multiple endocytosis signals, including two NPFXDs near the C terminus and PEST-like sequences near the N terminus that may mediate ubiquitin (Ub) -dependent endocytosis. Drs 2 p localizes to the trans-Golgi network in wild-type cells and accumulates on the plasma membrane when both the Ub- and NPFXD-dependent endocytic mechanisms are inactivated. Surprisingly, the pan 1 - 20 temperature-sensitive mutant is constitutively defective for Ub-dependent endocytosis but is not defective for NPFXD-dependent endocytosis at the permissive growth temperature. To sustain viability of pan 1 - 20, Drs 2 p must be endocytosed through the NPFXD/Sla 1 p pathway. Thus, Drs 2 p is an <b>essential</b> endocytic <b>cargo</b> in cells compromised for Ub-dependent endocytosis.

40|$|The unique {{architecture}} of neurons requires {{the establishment and}} maintenance of polarity, which relies in part on microtubule-based kinesin motor transport to deliver <b>essential</b> <b>cargo</b> into axons and dendrites. In developing neurons, kinesin trafficking is essential for delivering organelles and molecules that are crucial for elongation and guidance of the growing axonal and dendritic termini. In mature neurons, kinesin cargo delivery is essential for neuron dynamic physiological functions which are critical in brain development. In this work, we followed Spatial (Tbata) gene expression during primary hippocampal neuron development and showed that it is highly expressed during dendrite formation. Spatial protein exhibits a somatodendritic distribution and we show that the kinesin motor Kif 17, among other dendrite specific kinesins, is crucial for Spatial localization to dendrites of hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, Spatial down regulation in primary hippocampal cells revealed a role for Spatial in maintaining neurons' polarity by ensuring proper neurite outgrowth. This polarity is specified by intrinsic and extracellular signals that allow neurons to determine axon and dendrite fate during development. Neurotrophic factors, such as the Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), are candidate extracellular polarity-regulating cues which are proposed to accelerate neuronal polarization by enhancing dendrite growth.

In budding yeast, growth is highly asymmetric and requires a constant delivery of secretory cargo to growth sites. This polarized growth depends on an interplay between the cytoskeletal machinery responsible of directed transport and the secretory systems ensuring proper generation and fusion of membrane carriers. Almost all membrane movements are dependent on the myosin-V motor Myo 2 p, but how Myo 2 p recognizes and associates with secretory membranes, its only <b>essential</b> <b>cargo,</b> is currently unknown. Here I identify two myo 2 alleles that are sensitive to the levels of Golgi PI 4 P and of the Rab GTPases Sec 4 p and Ypt 31 p. I show that PI 4 P is enriched in the late secretory compartments and is critical for their association with, and transport by, Myo 2 p. Similarly, I found a direct interaction between the Myo 2 p tail and the Rabs Ypt 31 / 32 p and Sec 4 p, disruption of which correlates with uncoupling of the secretory cargo from Myo 2 p. Although the Myo 2 p tail failed to bind PI 4 P directly in our assays, enhancing Myo 2 p's association with PI 4 P by fusing it to a PH domain specific for this lipid rescues the PI 4 P-sensitive myo 2 alleles as well as a Rab-binding deficient myo 2 mutant. I also present evidence that additional proteins can modulate the interaction between Myo 2 p and the Rabs, supporting a model where a multicomponent complex makes up the secretory vesicle receptor. Taken together, the data presented here support a model where the Rab GTPase Sec 4 p, {{and to a lesser extent}} Ypt 31 / 32 p, and the phosphoinositide PI 4 P facilitates the recruitment of Myo 2 p to secretory membranes, resulting in their polarized delivery to sites of growth...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Synaptic {{dysfunction}} and intracellular transport defects are early {{events in}} Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Extracellular amyloid β (Aβ) oligomers cause spine alterations and impede {{the transport of}} proteins and organelles such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and mitochondria that are required for synaptic function. Meanwhile, intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ precedes its extracellular deposition and is also associated with synaptic dysfunction in AD. However, the links between intracellular Aβ, spine alteration, and mechanisms that support synaptic maintenance such as organelle trafficking are poorly understood. Results We compared the effects of wild-type and Osaka (E 693 Δ) -mutant amyloid precursor proteins: the former secretes Aβ into extracellular space and the latter accumulates Aβ oligomers within cells. First we investigated the effects of intracellular Aβ oligomers on dendritic spines in primary neurons and their tau-dependency using tau knockout neurons. We found that intracellular Aβ oligomers caused a reduction in mushroom, or mature spines, independently of tau. We also found that intracellular Aβ oligomers significantly impaired the intracellular transport of BDNF, mitochondria, and recycling endosomes: <b>cargoes</b> <b>essential</b> for synaptic maintenance. A reduction in BDNF transport by intracellular Aβ oligomers was also observed in tau knockout neurons.

40|$|Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is {{a devastating}} {{neurodegenerative}} disease that currently affects more than 26 million people worldwide and {{is projected to}} triple in prevalence by 2015. As such it represents an enormous economic, medical, scientific, and emotional burden on society. Despite extensive efforts, {{there is no cure}} and current treatments are only effective at ameloriating symptoms without delaying the progression of disease. Part of the challenge may stem from the use of model systems that incompletely recapitulate human disease. The recently discovered technology of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSCS) has reinvigorated investigators and brought hope to the fields of AD. The power of hIPSC technology is the ability to capture the genomes of individual with complex genetic diseases in a pluripotent cell with the ability to become any one of the body. By driving hIPSC down a neuronal lineage, we can grow human neurons and model AD in a dish in the relevant cell type. A hallmark of the polarized structure of a neuron is it long thin axon where a wide variety of <b>cargo</b> <b>essential</b> for proper neuronal viability must be transported correctly to and from the axon terminal. Perturbations of this complex neuronal process can have drastic consequences and, in fact, many neurological diseases are associated with defects in neuronals novel, neuron-specific sorting defects in hIPSC-derived neurons with familial AD mutations. Specifically, we see that toxic, intracellular accumulations of [Beta]CTFs,proteolytic products of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), mediate decreased endocytosis and transcytosis of APP itself and lipoproteins. That this is a common phenotype of many fAD mutations suggests that impaired axonal delivery of lipoproteins compromises synaptic maintenance in fAD. In a specific fAD mutation, PS 1 [Delta]E 9, we analyzed the complex axonal transport behavior of a number of AD- relevant cargo including APP, BACE 1, Rab 5 a, mitochondria, and lysosomes. We report that PS 1 [Delta]E 9 mutant neurons have enhanced anterograde transport of APP, possibly because of increased phosphorylated JIP 1, while having no differences in Rab 5 a, BACE 1, or mitochondrial transport behavior. Importantly, these transport changes accompanied by decreased density of axonal acidic vesicles and implicates impaired clearance of toxic axonal cargo in AD pathogenesi...|$|R
40|$|For over 20 years, cell-penetrating {{peptides}} (CPPs) {{have been}} used as delivery vectors transporting macromolecules (cargos) into live cells for cell biology manipulations and therapeutic applications. While the exact mechanism of cell penetration remains controversial, it is thought that CPPs are first internalized inside endocytic vesicles and have been reported to escape to the cytosolic space of cells. However, while the internalization of CPPs inside vesicles has proven to be highly efficient, their endosomal escape activity remains suboptimal and poorly understood. This is a severe limitation of the CPP-mediated delivery approach because the macromolecules? escape is <b>essential</b> if the <b>cargo</b> is to interact with its cytosolic/nuclear targets. Multiple approaches to enhance CPP?s endosomolytic activity have been explored (summarized in Chapter 1). Multivalency has been proposed as a possible new approach, in which multiple copies of a molecule are attached as one functional unit. It has been hypothesized that the use of multivalent CPPs will result in an increase in their local concentration at the membrane; and as a consequence enhance their membrane disruption property. In Chapter 2, I report on the generation of a multivalent CPP: dfTAT, a dimeric version of the most studied CPP, TAT. Similar to TAT, dfTAT enters cells via macropinocytosis. Interestingly, while monomeric TAT is extremely inefficient at escaping the endocytic pathway, I demonstrate that dfTAT escapes endosomes with an unprecedented level of efficiency. Cytosolic penetration of dfTAT can be achieved in multiple cell lines and primary cells, without impacting the cell?s physiology. Most importantly, dfTAT can efficiently deliver a wide variety of macromolecules and cell-impermeable small molecules efficiently into the cytosolic space of live cells. In Chapter 3, I report on the role that chirality and protease-resistance have on the endosomal escape behavior of dfTAT. By inverting dfTAT?s chirality from L to D stereochemistry, I generated a protease-resistant dfTAT (D-dfTAT). Interestingly, I show that while the mechanism of cellular entry remains the same, D-dfTAT?s cellular internalization is substantially lower than dfTAT. Nonetheless, once in the endosome, DdfTAT escapes with a higher efficiency than its L-counterpart. Finally, while dfTAT treatment is relatively innocuous to cells, D-dfTAT unexpectedly exerted a prolonged anti-proliferative activity. The literature underscores the important role that arginine residues play in CPP cellular internalization. However, due to the low endosomolytic activity of most CPPs, residues vital for endosomal escape have not yet been established. In Chapter 4, I determined that the arginine residues are both necessary and sufficient for dfTAT endosomolytic activity. Interestingly, a minimum number of 12 arginine residues is required for sufficient endosomal escape. Overall, this work identifies a novel endosomolytic agent and identifies some of the molecular features important for cellular permeation. In turn, my results lay the foundation for new and optimized versions of the dfTAT prototype that may find applications in a variety of delivery approaches...|$|R
40|$|Intracellular {{transportation}} {{is an essential}} cellular event controlling neuronal development, morphology, function and survival. Kinesin- 1 is the molecular motor conveying cargo along microtubule by utilizing the chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis. This motor consists of two heavy chains and two light chains. Both heavy and light chains are responsible for cargo bindings. There are three kinesin- 1 heavy chains in eukaryotic cells. Kif 5 a and Kif 5 c are neuronal specific, while Kif 5 b is ubiquitously expressed. Kif 5 b carries various <b>cargos</b> <b>essential</b> for neuronal functions, and the early embryonic death of Kif 5 b null mice suggests the importance of Kif 5 b in vivo. N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are glutamate elicited channel, which is permeable to calcium and crucial for synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system. NMDARs are heteromeric assemblies consisting of NR 1, NR 2 and NR 3 subunits. These transmembrane subunits contain three parts. Other than the transmembrane domain, the extracellular domain serves as the ligand binding site while the intracellular domain interacts with various partners regulating downstream signaling and receptor trafficking. Synaptic NMDAR activation regulates synaptic plasticity, while extrasynaptic NMDAR activation leads to excitotoxicity. In this project, I find that kinesin- 1 directly interacts with NMDAR subunit, NR 1, NR 2 A and NR 2 B in vivo. NMDAR colocalizes with kinesin- 1 in the cell body and neurites. By GST-pull-down assays with different Kif 5 b fragments, the cytoplasmic domains of NR 1, NR 2 A and NR 2 B are found to directly bind with Kif 5 b via a Kif 5 b C-terminal region independent of kinesin light chains. To examine the role of Kif 5 b in NMDAR trafficking, dominant negative Kif 5 b fragments are expressed in cell lines together with NR 1 - 1 a and GFP-NR 2 B. Overexpression of dominant negative Kif 5 b significantly disrupts GFP-NR 2 B forward trafficking and prevents it from entering into Golgi apparatus. Furthermore, the surface NR 1 and NR 2 B levels are significantly reduced whilst the NR 2 A levels are not affected in Kif 5 b+/- mice in which the Kif 5 b protein level is reduced by 50 % compared with the wild-type littermates. Consistent with this observation, the NR 1 and NR 2 B levels are decreased in fractions containing synaptosomal membrane but not the one containing only postsynaptic densities, suggesting that the extrasynaptic NMDAR levels are affected in Kif 5 b+/- mice. NMDARs are highly permeable to calcium while activated, thereby activating neuronal nitric oxide synthases (nNOS) to produce nitric oxide (NO). It is found that NMDA triggered calcium influx is perturbed in Kif 5 b+/- neurons, while the synaptic NMDA receptor mediated calcium influx is normal. In Kif 5 b+/- slices, the production of NO reduces significantly. Calcium ionophore, A 23187, rescue this NO defect, indicating insufficient supply of calcium as the main contribution to this defect. Therefore, Kif 5 b-dependent extrasynaptic localization of NMDA receptors mediates calcium influx upon NMDA stimulation and controls NO production. In the summary, above results suggest kinesin- 1 as a novel motor involving in NMDA receptor trafficking. This interaction {{may contribute to the}} extrasynaptic distribution of NMDARs. By regulating NO production through interaction with NMDARs, Kif 5 b may mediate neuronal survival in cerebral ischemia and certain aggressive behaviors. This provides a novel target for therapy development against stroke and schizophrenia. published_or_final_versionBiochemistryDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
