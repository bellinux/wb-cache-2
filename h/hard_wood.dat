5|$|The {{hammering}} of woodpeckers when drumming or feeding creates great {{forces which}} are potentially {{damaging to the}} birds. In the great spotted woodpecker {{and most of its}} relatives, the hinge where the front of the skull connects with the upper mandible is folded inwards, tensioned by a muscle that braces it against the shock of the impact when the bill is hammering on <b>hard</b> <b>wood.</b> The outer layer of the upper mandible is significantly longer than the more rigid lower mandible and absorbs much of the concussive force. Skeletal adaptations and strengthening also help to absorb the shock, and narrow nostrils protect against flying debris.|$|E
25|$|An infill plane has a body {{of metal}} filled with very dense and <b>hard</b> <b>wood</b> on which the blade rests and the handles are formed. They are {{typically}} of English or Scottish manufacture. They are prized {{for their ability to}} smooth difficult grained woods when set very finely.|$|E
25|$|The derkach is {{occasionally}} used in Ukrainian folk instrument orchestras, but {{is usually}} found as a child's toy. The derkach {{was made by}} taking a piece of rounded <b>hard</b> <b>wood</b> and cutting teeth into it. Another piece of wood is joined to this with a tongue. As this piece rotates around the rounded piece, the tongue makes a noise as it passes over the teeth.|$|E

Sections of the Secaucus Greenway are in place and eventually will connect different districts of the town including the North End, site Schmidts Woods (which contains an original <b>hard</b> <b>wood</b> forest) and Mill Creek Point Park, and Harmon Meadow Plaza. Kearny Riverbank Park runs along the Passaic River. The future of the Harsimus Stem Embankment is uncertain, though many community groups hope the landmark will be {{opened to the public}} as elevated greenway, possibly as part of East Coast Greenway.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} was erected around a rectangular central patio with arched galleries {{on all sides}} that serve as transitional elements {{to the office and}} room areas located throughout its periphery, all of which are typical of the period and style. A small fountain {{in the center of the}} patio served the dual purposes of ornamentation and water supply. This element no longer exists. The building was constructed of brick and a mixture of rubblework and stone. A series of symmetrically-placed thick walls carrying wooden beams, probably of ausubo or other Puerto Rican <b>hard</b> <b>wood,</b> support the brick roof. This structure has a basement, an uncommon element in this type of construction, on its south side.|$|E
25|$|The Sundarbans flora is characterised by the {{abundance}} of sundari (Heritiera fomes), gewa (Excoecaria agallocha), goran (Ceriops decandra) and keora (Sonneratia apetala) all of which occur prominently throughout the area. The characteristic tree of the forest is the sundari (Heritiera littoralis), from which {{the name of the}} forest had probably been derived. It yields a <b>hard</b> <b>wood,</b> used for building houses and making boats, furniture and other things. New forest accretions is often conspicuously dominated by keora (Sonneratia apetala) and tidal forests. It is an indicator species for newly accreted mudbanks and is an important species for wildlife, especially spotted deer (Axis axis). There is abundance of dhundul or passur (Xylocarpus granatum) and kankra (Bruguiera gymnorhiza) though distribution is discontinuous. Among palms, Poresia coaractata, Myriostachya wightiana and golpata (Nypa fruticans), and among grasses spear grass (Imperata cylindrica) and khagra (Phragmites karka) are well distributed.|$|E

5000|$|Two {{kinds of}} spile are available. Initially, [...] "soft" [...] or porous spiles are used, made of open-grained softwood, bamboo, or <b>harder</b> <b>wood</b> with cuts in. These allow the excess gas to escape. Once the {{cellarman}} judges this process to be complete, a hard spile is inserted {{which does not}} allow any more gas out of the cask. These are made of <b>harder</b> <b>wood</b> (usually still technically [...] "softwood", but denser and more solid than soft spiles). Plastic pegs intended for sealing shives are occasionally used as hard spiles.|$|R
50|$|The {{beginnings}} of modern wood engraving techniques {{developed at the}} end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, with the works of Englishman Thomas Bewick. Bewick generally engraved <b>harder</b> <b>woods,</b> such as boxwood, rather than the woods used in woodcuts, and he engraved the ends of blocks instead of the side. Finding a woodcutting knife not suitable for working against the grain in <b>harder</b> <b>woods,</b> Bewick used a burin (or graver), an engraving tool with a V-shaped cutting tip. From the beginning of the nineteenth century Bewick's techniques gradually came into wider use, especially in Britain and the United States.|$|R
25|$|Because each nest {{represents}} a separate colony, there are exceptionally small colonies, {{which are a}} clear adaptation to {{the high degree of}} environmental variability. A large colony requires either many small nest chambers or a few larger ones. The exchange between the many small chambers will increase the time the workers spend outside the nests and therefore also the degree of predation. More important for this species is the possibility of being washed away by the tide, waves or heavy rainstorms. Large nest cavities require very long hollowed twigs, which break easily during strong winds, potentially resulting in the ants being washed away. Larger cavities in thicker branches require the ants to excavate <b>hard</b> <b>wood,</b> which {{did not seem to be}} the case for this species. A more serious problem is the coccids, which primarily require cavities with a thin wall. Finally, a large cavity with several entrances and a large volume of air is much more difficult to keep waterproof during flooding.|$|E
25|$|In France, Grenache is {{most widely}} {{associated}} with the wines of the Rhone and southern France. Its history in the Rhone {{can be traced to}} the influence of Burgundian wine merchants in the 17-18th centuries who were seeking a blending variety to add body and alcohol content to their light body wines. Grenache, with its propensity for high alcohol and high yields, fit those desire nicely and was widely planted in the Châteauneuf-du-Pape and Gigondas and Vacqueyras regions. Today Grenache is most widely planted in the Languedoc-Roussillon region where it is widely blended with Carignan, Cinsaut, Syrah and Mourvèdre. The vine also has sizable plantings in the Drôme department. The vine's strong, <b>hard</b> <b>wood</b> and affinity for bush vine training allows it to thrive in the Mistral influenced southern Rhone regions of Châteauneuf-du-Pape and Gigondas. In Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Grenache noir is the most common variety of the 13 permitted varieties, although some producers in recent years have been using a higher proportion of Mourvèdre. Grenache produces a sweet juice that can have almost a jam-like consistency when very ripe. Syrah is typically blended to provide color and spice, while Mourvèdre can add elegance and structure to the wine.|$|E
25|$|A {{kneeling}} chair adds {{an additional}} body part, the knees, {{to support the}} weight of the body. A sit-stand chair distributes most of {{the weight of the}} occupant to the feet. Many chairs are padded or have cushions. Padding can be on the seat of the chair only, on the seat and back, or also on any arm rests or foot rest the chair may have. Padding will not shift the weight to different parts of the body (unless the chair is so soft that the shape is altered). However, padding does distribute the weight by increasing the area of contact between the chair and the body. A <b>hard</b> <b>wood</b> chair feels hard because the contact point between the occupant and the chair is small. The same body weight over a smaller area means greater pressure on that area. Spreading the area reduces the pressure at any given point. In lieu of padding, flexible materials, such as wicker, may be used instead with similar effects of distributing the weight. Since most of the body weight is supported {{in the back of the}} seat, padding there should be firmer than the front of the seat which only has the weight of the legs to support. Chairs that have padding that is the same density front and back will feel soft in the back area and hard to the underside of the knees.|$|E

500|$|For many years, {{the origin}} of Cabernet Sauvignon was not clearly {{understood}} and many myths and conjectures surrounded it. The word [...] "Sauvignon" [...] {{is believed to be}} derived from the French sauvage meaning [...] "wild" [...] and to refer to the grape being a wild Vitis vinifera vine native to France. Until recently the grape was rumored to have ancient origins, perhaps even being the Biturica grape used to make ancient Roman wine and referenced by Pliny the Elder. This belief was widely held in the 18th century, when the grape was also known as Petite Vidure or Bidure, apparently a corruption of Biturica. There was also belief that Vidure was a reference to the <b>hard</b> <b>wood</b> (French vigne dure) of the vine, with a possible relationship to Carménère which was once known as Grand Vidure. Another theory was that the grapevine originated in the Rioja region of Spain.|$|E
5000|$|Kamagong timber is {{extremely}} dense and hard and {{is famous for}} its dark color. Like many other very <b>hard</b> <b>woods,</b> it is sometimes called [...] "iron wood" [...] because its wood is iron-like and nearly unbreakable.|$|R

500|$|In {{the lumber}} {{industry}} Acer rubrum {{is considered a}} [...] "soft maple", a designation it shares, commercially, with silver maple (A. saccharinum). In this context, the term [...] "soft" [...] is more comparative, than descriptive; i.e., [...] "soft maple", while softer than it's harder cousin, sugar maple (A. saccharum), is still a fairly <b>hard</b> <b>wood,</b> being comparable to Black Cherry (Prunus serotina) in this regard. [...] Like A. saccharum, the wood of red maple is close-grained, but its texture is softer, less dense, and has not as desirable an appearance, particularly under a clear finish. [...] However, the wood from Acer rubrum while being typically less expensive than hard maple, also has greater dimensional stability than that of A. saccharum, and also machines and stains easier. Thus, high grades of wood from the red maple can be substituted for hard maple, {{particularly when it comes}} to making stain/paint-grade furniture. Red maple lumber also contains a greater percentage of [...] "curly" [...] (aka [...] "flame"/"fiddleback") figure, which is prized by musical instrument/custom furniture makers, as well as the veneer industry. [...] As a soft maple, the wood tends to shrink more during the drying process than with the hard maples.|$|E
