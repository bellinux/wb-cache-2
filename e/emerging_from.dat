5|$|A {{wavefront}} splitting interferometer divides a light wavefront <b>emerging</b> <b>from</b> a {{point or}} a narrow slit (i.e. spatially coherent light) and, after allowing {{the two parts}} of the wavefront to travel through different paths, allows them to recombine. Fig.5 illustrates Young's interference experiment and Lloyd's mirror. Other examples of wavefront splitting interferometer include the Fresnel biprism, the Billet Bi-Lens, and the Rayleigh interferometer.|$|E

5|$|Crop {{rotation}} is, {{however, the}} most important cultural control of L. decemlineata. Rotation may delay the infestation of potatoes and can reduce the build-up of early season beetle populations because the adults <b>emerging</b> <b>from</b> diapause can only disperse to new food sources by walking. One 1984 study showed that rotating potatoes with non-host plants reduced the density of early season adults by 95.8%.|$|E
