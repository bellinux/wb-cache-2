40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{large-scale}} pulsed corona system {{is described in}} which pulse parameters such as pulse rise-time, peak voltage, pulse width and energy per pulse can be varied. The chemical efficiency {{of the system is}} determined by measuring ozone production. The temporal and spatial development of the discharge streamers is recorded using an ICCD camera with a shortest exposure time of 5 ns. The camera can be triggered at any moment starting from the time the voltage pulse arrives on the reactor, with an accuracy of less than 1 ns. Measurements were performed on an industrial size wire-plate reactor. The influence of pulse parameters like pulse voltage, DC bias voltage, rise-time and pulse repetition rate on plasma generation was monitored. It was observed that for higher peak voltages, an increase could be seen in the primary streamer velocity, the growth of the primary streamer diameter, the light intensity and the number of streamers per unit length of corona wire. No significant separate influence of DC bias voltage level was observed as long as the total reactor voltage (pulse + DC bias) remained constant and the DC bias voltage remained below the DC corona onset. For those situations in which the plasma appearance changed (e. g. different streamer velocity, diameter, intensity), a change in ozone production was also observed. The best chemical yields were obtained for low voltage (55 kV), low energetic pulses (0. 4 J/pulse) : 60 <b>g</b> (<b>kWh)</b> - 1. For high voltage (86 kV), high energetic pulses (2. 3 J/pulse) the yield decreased to approximately 45 <b>g</b> (<b>kWh)</b> - 1, still a high value for ozone production in ambient air (RH 42 %). The pulse repetition rate has no influence on plasma generation and on chemical efficiency up to 400 pulses per second...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAccording to the {{directive}} on energy end-use efficiency and energy services (ESD), the European Member States shall adopt a national indicative energy savings target of 9 % (or beyond) in 2016. The {{issue of the}} energy savings evaluation is crucial for its implementation. The French White Certificates (FWC) scheme {{is one of the}} important measures for France to fulfill its ESD target. However, the accountings of energy savings in the FWC scheme and in the ESD are different. Therefore, an analysis of the consistency of the two systems is needed. A concrete example of actions on residential buildings is used to illustrate the challenges for policy marker and stakeholders to set harmonized evaluation rules. The FWC and ESD calculations appear to be consistent from a physics point of view, as long as calculations are well-documented. But due to differences in the policy objectives, calculation routines may be necessary to convert national energy savings unit (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>kWh</b> cumac) into supranational energy savings unit (e. g., ESD kWh). Finally, the work done to establish a transparent evaluation system brings additional benefits (e. g., increased visibility and quality of the actions), which will improve the results of the energy efficiency policies on long term...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} particle and gaseous emission factors {{from a large}} cargo vessel for her whole voyage including at berth, manoeuvring and cruising. Quantification of these factors assists in minimising the uncertainty in the current methods of exhaust gas emission factor estimation. Engine performance and emissions from the main marine engine were measured on-board while the ship was manoeuvring and cruising at sea. Emissions of an auxiliary engine working at 55 % of maximum continuous rating (MCR) were measured when the ship was at actual harbour stopovers. Gaseous and particle emission factors {{in this study are}} presented in <b>g</b> <b>kWh</b> - 1 or # kWh - 1, and compared with previous studies. Results showed that the SO 2 emission factor is higher than that of previous studies due to the high sulphur content of the fuel used. The particle number size distributions showed only one mode for different operating conditions of the ship, with a peak at around 40 - 50 nm, which was dominated by ultrafine particles. Emission factors of CO, HC, PM and PN observed during ship manoeuvring were much higher than that of those recorded at cruising condition. These findings highlight the importance of quantification and monitoring ship emissions in close proximity to port areas, as they can have the highest impact on population exposure...|$|E

40|$|China's new "Twelfth Five-Year Plan" set {{a target}} for total NO x {{emission}} reduction of 10 % {{for the period of}} 2011 – 2015. Heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDDVs) have been considered a major contributor to NO x emissions in China. Beijing initiated a comprehensive vehicle test program in 2008. This program included a sub-task for measuring on-road emission profiles of hundreds of HDDVs using portable emission measurement systems (PEMS). The major finding is that neither the on-road distance-specific (g km − 1) nor brake-specific (<b>g</b> <b>kWh</b> − 1) NO x emission factors for diesel buses and heavy-duty diesel trucks improved in most cases as emission standards became more stringent. For example, the average NO x emission factors for Euro II, Euro III and Euro IV buses are 11. 3 ± 3. 3 g km − 1, 12. 5 ± 1. 3 g km − 1, and 11. 8 ± 2. 0 g km − 1, respectively. No statistically significant difference in NO x emission factors was observed between Euro II and III buses. Even for Euro IV buses equipped with SCR systems, the NO x emission factors are similar to Euro III buses. The data regarding real-time engine performance of Euro IV buses suggest the engine certification cycles did not reflect their real-world operating conditions. These new on-road test results indicate that previous estimates of total NO x emissions for HDDV fleet may be significantly underestimated. The new estimate in total NO x emissions for the Beijing HDDV fleet in 2009 is 37. 0 Gg, an increase of 45 % compared to the previous study. Further, we estimate that the total NO x emissions for the national HDDV fleet in 2009 are approximately 4. 0 Tg, higher by 1. 0 Tg (equivalent to 18 % of total NO x emissions for vehicle fleet in 2009) than that estimated in the official report. This would also result in 4 % increase in estimation of national anthropogenic NO x emissions. More effective control measures (such as promotion of CNG buses and a new in-use compliance testing program) are urged to secure the goal of total NO x mitigation for the HDDV fleet in the future...|$|E
40|$|A {{reliable}} and up-to-date maritime emission inventory {{is essential for}} atmospheric scientists quantifying the impact of shipping. The objective {{of this study is}} to estimate the atmospheric emissions of SO 2, NO x, CO 2 and PM 10 by international merchant shipping in 2007 in the Strait of Gibraltar, Spain, including the Algeciras Bay by two methods. Two methods (both bottom-up) have been used in this study: 1. Establishing engine power-based emission factors (<b>g</b> <b>kWh</b> − 1, EPA) or the mass of pollutant per work performed by the engine for each of the relevant components of the exhaust gas from diesel engines and power for each ship. 2. Establishing fuel-based emission factors (kg emitted/t of fuel) or mass of pollutant per mass of combusted fuel for each of the relevant components of the exhaust gas and a fuel-consumption inventory (IMO). In both methods, the means to estimate engine power and fuel-consumption inventories are the same. The exhaust from boilers and incinerators is regarded as a small contributor and excluded. In total, an estimated average of 1 389 111. 05 t of CO 2, 23 083. 09 t of SO 2, 32 005. 63 t of NO x and 2972 t of PM 10 were emitted from January 2007 until December 2007 by international and domestic shipping. The estimated total fuel consumption amounts to 437 405. 84 t. The major differences between the estimates generated by the two methods are for NO x (16 % in certain cases) and CO (up to 23 %). A total difference for all compounds of 3038 t (approximately 2 %) has been found between the two methods but it is not areasonable estimate of uncertainty. Therefore, the results for both methods may be considered acceptable because the actual uncontrolled deviations appear in the changes in emission factors that occur for a given engine with age. These deviations are often difficult to quantify and depend on individual shipboard service and maintenance routines. Emission factors for CO and NO x are not constant and depend on engine condition. For example, tests conducted by the authors of this paper demonstrate that when an engine operates under normal in-service conditions, the emissions are within limits. However, with a small fault in injection timing, the NO x emission exceeds the limits (30 % higher value in some cases). A fault in the maintenance of the injection nozzles increases the CO emission (15 % higher value in some cases) ...|$|E

30|$|Not surprisingly, {{environmental}} costs of battery production and usage {{are subject to}} intensive scientific discussion, revealing corresponding CO 2 -equivalent emissions of a great variety (Table 4). However, these variations are only to a little extent due to the battery chemistry and, least of all, due to the metal lithium since a Li-ion battery contains only about 1 % lithium or 80 <b>g</b> Li per <b>kWh</b> energy content [68]. Also, the Li purifying process is not energy-intensive [33], nor is Li related to a comparably high depletion of resources, according to Althaus et al. [68]. The LiFePO 4 battery used in the Smart conversion project performed by the authors contains 3.4 % Li. Besides the Li, the LiFePO 4 battery (manufacturer: Calb, China) has a content of 42 % Fe, 16 % P, 5 % graphite, 3 % C, 6 % Al, and 10 % Cu, respectively (MSDS accreditation certificate, 2009). The components of the highest relevance within the whole battery LCA are the anode and cathode materials graphite, copper, and aluminum [61, 68]. Majeau-Bettez et al.

With this potentially being decreased to 15 g/kWh in the future.For comparison (of weighted averages), a combined cycle gas-fired power plant emits some 400-599 g/kWh, an oil-fired power plant 893 g/kWh, a coal-fired power plant 915-994 g/kWh or with carbon capture and storage some 200 g/kWh, and a geothermal high-temp. power plant 91-122 g/kWh. The life cycle emission intensity of hydro, wind and nuclear power are lower than solar's as of 2011 as published by the IPCC, and discussed in the article Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources. Similar to all energy sources were their total life cycle emissions primarily lay in the construction and transportation phase, the switch to low carbon power in the manufacturing and transportation of solar devices would further reduce carbon emissions. BP Solar owns two factories built by Solarex (one in Maryland, the other in Virginia) in which all of the energy used to manufacture solar panels is produced by solar panels. A 1-kilowatt system eliminates the burning of approximately 170 pounds of coal, 300 pounds of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere, and saves up to 105 gallons of water consumption monthly.|$|R
40|$|Electricity {{is vital}} for our daily life in modern cites. In order to ensure its {{reliability}} and supply, an electric power monitoring system is indispensable in an electric power system. Currently, most electric power monitoring systems are designed for steady-state monitoring only. They {{may not be able}} to monitor instantaneous power disturbances, such as voltage surge, happened in electric power systems. In fact, instantaneous power disturbances are frequently found in electric power systems, which result in equipment failures and cause financial losses. Therefore, a novel electric power monitoring system is proposed in this thesis. Besides traditional functions, the proposed system is capable of monitoring and analyzing instantaneous power disturbances in electric power systems. Novelties of the proposed monitoring system are in the following three major aspects. Firstly, the proposed system is capable of monitoring instantaneous power disturbances. Unlike traditional monitoring systems, the proposed system captures not only statistical power quantities (e. <b>g.</b> kW, <b>kWh),</b> but also voltage and current waveforms. Since a considerable communication network bandwidth is required to transmit electric waveforms in a remote monitoring system, a novel waveform compression algorithm is proposed to realize real-time electric power waveform monitoring on low-speed communication networks (e. g. Zigbee). Secondly, the proposed system is capable of identifying various kinds of power disturbances automatically. It relieves electrical engineers from manned disturbance identification on preserved waveforms. Unlike traditional disturbance identification algorithms, the proposed system can identify not only voltage disturbances, but also current disturbances. Hence, it can provide a better chance in identifying more problems and disturbances in electric power systems. Thirdly, a novel time-frequency analysis method is proposed to analyze preserved waveforms. The proposed method is an improvement to the well-known Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform (DWPT). DWPT has been used by researchers and engineers to analyze disturbances and harmonics in electric power systems. However, DWPT is subjected to a non-uniform leakage problem, which has been discussed intensively in many studies. In order to tackle this issue, a frequency shifting scheme is introduced in the proposed method. A prototype has been implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed electric power monitoring system. There are two major components – a prototype meter and a central monitoring system. The performance of the prototype has been evaluated by conducting experiments and field tests. The capability of the proposed system for realtime remote monitoring has been verified on Zigbee network, which is a low-power, low speed wireless communication network...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a simulation model, MEDEE 2, designed {{to evaluate the}} long-term energy demand of a country, in combination with a scenario description of the main aspects of the country's social, economic, and technological evolution. This approach considers in a detailed way a national energy demand pattern and breaks down the total demand in a multitude of end-use categories (e. g., residential space heating, service sector cooling, gasoline for intercity cars). By means of this detailed investigation of energy demand we {{are better able to}} take into account the influence on energy demand of changes in social needs, economic growth, government policies, or technologies, especially in the present context of high energy prices. In addition, it makes possible the identification of the potential market (i. e. maximum demand that can be technically met) of each final energy form (e. g., electricity, coal, gas, solar, oil products, and district heat). The model calculates useful energy demand in each end-use category for which several energy forms can be used, thus determining the substitution possibilities in energy use. This useful energy matches the energy service needed by the consumer (e. g., heat, mechanical energy). Useful energy differs from final energy, purchased by the consumer, by the efficiency of the enduse appliances. Each useful energy demand is then converted into a demand for final energy, taking into account the fuel mix (i. e., the fraction of the demand supplied by each fuel) and the end-use efficiencies of each fuel. This approach-estimating useful energy-is necessary if one wants to account for the differences in fuel efficiencies: for the same service (let us say 1 kwh of heat) the final demand will vary according to the fuel type because of these different efficiencies (e. <b>g.,</b> 1 <b>kwh</b> of electricity, 1. 35 kwh of gas, 1. 50 kwh of oil, and 2 kwh of coal). The total final demand is projected in MEDEE 2 for the following types of final energy forms: fossil fuel '(substitutable use of coal, oil, and gas), electricity, motor fuel, coke, feedstock, solar, and district heat. MEDEE 2 is driven by a set of scenario elements, the evolution of which is defined in a scenario. The core of the scenario is a characterization through these elements of the development pattern of the country under consideration (life-styles, economic growth patterns, etc.). The scenario description is complemented with technological parameters (e. g., insulation standards, efficiencies, fuel mix), the evolution of which is specified in a way consistent with the macroeconomic assumptions...|$|R
40|$|Emission {{factors of}} SO 2, NO x and size-distributed {{particle}} numbers were measured for approximately 300 different {{ships in the}} Gulf of Finland and Neva Bay area during two campaigns in August/September 2011 and June/July 2012. The measurements were carried out from a harbor vessel and from an Mi- 8 helicopter downwind of passing ships. Other measurements were carried out from shore sites near the island of Kronstadt and along the Neva River in the urban area of Saint Petersburg. Most ships were running at reduced speed (10 kn), i. e., not at their optimal load. Vessels for domestic and international shipping were monitored. It was seen that {{the distribution of the}} SO 2 emission factors is bi-modal, with averages of 4. 6 and 18. 2 g SO 2 kg fuel - 1 for the lower and the higher mode, respectively. The emission factors show compliance with the 1 % fuel sulfur content Sulfur Emission Control Areas (SECA) limit for 90 % of the vessels in 2011 and 97 % in 2012. The distribution of the NO x emission factor is mono-modal, with an average of 58 g NO x kg fuel - 1. The corresponding emission related to the generated power yields an average of 12. 1 <b>g</b> NO x <b>kWh</b> − 1. The distribution of the emission factors for particulate number shows that nearly 90 % of all particles in the 5. 6 nm to 10 μm size range were below 70 nm in diameter. The distribution of the corresponding emission factors for the mass indicates two separated main modes, one for particles between 30 and 300 nm and the other for above 2 μm. The average particle emission factors were found to be in the range from 0. 7 to 2. 7 × 10 16 particles kg fuel - 1 and 0. 2 to 3. 4 g PM kg fuel - 1, respectively. The NO x and particulate emissions are comparable with other studies. The measured emission factors were compared, for individual ships, to modeled ones using the Ship Traffic Emission Assessment Model (STEAM) of the Finnish Meteorological Institute. A reasonably good agreement for gaseous sulfur and nitrogen emissions can be seen for ships in international traffic, but significant deviations are found for inland vessels. Regarding particulate mass, the values of the modeled data are about 2 – 3 times higher than the measured results, which probably reflects the assumptions made in the modeled fuel sulfur content. The sulfur contents in the fuel retrieved from the measurements were lower than the previously used assumptions by the City of Saint Petersburg when carrying out atmospheric modeling, and using these measurements it was possible to better assess the impact of shipping on air quality...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{wastewater}} treatment plants (WWTPs), like activated sludge systems, are energy demanding requiring a large electrical energy supply (e. <b>g.</b> 25 <b>kWh</b> PE- 1 year- 1) which, especially during peak-load periods, may account for an important quote of the grid installed power of the surrounding area. Only across the EU, there are 16000 WWTPs that consume around 10000 GWh year- 1 of electricity. Furthermore, the volume of wastewater treated in WWTPs in the EU is increasing with a rate of around 7 % each year. Besides the related financial costs, this energy consumption creates an additional environmental burden. Considering that energy in Europe is mainly produced from the burning of fossil fuels, it has been calculated that energy consumption from WWTPs creates emissions of more than 27 Mtonnes year- 1 of CO 2 in the EU. Concerns about greenhouse gas emissions on a global level and cost issues on a microeconomic level have become major driving forces towards a more efficient usage of energy in {{wastewater treatment}}. In conventional wastewater treatment about 50 % of the energy input is consumed in the aeration systems in order to remove organic matter (Chemical Oxygen Demand, COD) while about 25 % is consumed in the nitrogen removal process (nitrification/denitrification) (Siegrist et al., 2008). Autotrophic nitrogen removal by anammox bacteria is to date the most efficient and environmentally friendly process {{for the treatment of}} ammonium in wastewaters and its application can save up to 60 % of the energy input needed for nitrification. Application of anammox to municipal sewage treatment appears as a prerequisite to allow treatment scenarios for {{wastewater treatment plants}} with a net energy production (Kartal et al., 2010 a). In a treatment scheme where nitrogen is removed via an autotrophic metabolic pathway such as partial nitritation/anammox (PN/anammox),the COD load, which is conventionally oxidized to C 02 partly with oxygen and partly with nitrate (N 03 -) in the denitrification process, can be used to generate energy in the form of methane-rich biogas via the anaerobic digestion process. Whilst the application of anammox related technologies in the side-stream is at present state of the art, the feasibility of this energy-efficient process in main-stream conditions is still under investigation. Lower and variable operating temperatures and ammonium concentrations, together with a demand for high and stable nitrogen removal efficiency, represent the main challenges to overcome for this appealing new frontier of the waste water treatment field. The research described in this thesis aimed at investigating the physiology and kinetic properties of anammox bacteria and their interaction with other microbial communities under municipal wastewater conditions with the ultimate scope of elucidating the boundary conditions for the application of the anammox-based process (PN/anammox) in the treatment of municipal sewage. This fundamental knowledge allow to design and successfully implement at lab- and pilot-scale the completely autotrophic nitrogen removal process for the treatment of municipal sewage. This thesis comprises therefore both fundamental and applied research which main results and achievements are briefly illustrated in this summary. Although anammox related technologies are currently widely applied for nitrogen removal from sewage sludge digester rejection water, many aspects of the anammox process like the kinetic characteristics and the reaction stoichiometry are still under investigation. Parameter values reported in literature are often influenced by mass transfer limitation or by the presence of inactive cells and a significant side population. In Chapter 2 a membrane bioreactor (MBR) based method for growing a highly enriched anammox microbial community is described. The almost pure free­cell suspension of highly active anammox bacteria was used for detailed kinetic and stoichiometric analysis of the anammox process. The yield of biomass production on ammonium uptake was calculated to be 0. 071 C-mol N-mol- 1, value that was then experimentally confirmed in Chapter 3. The elemental biomass composition was measured as CH 1. 740 o. 31 No. 20 So. 01 Po. 01 (22. 1 g C-mol- 1). From the yield and the elemental biomass composition the macro-chemical reaction equation was identified and validated by long-term reactor operations. The anammox culture described in Chapter 2 exhibited an unreported high biomass specific maximum growth rate of 0. 21 d- 1 corresponding to a doubling time of 3. 3 days at 30 °C. Using an experimental methodology based on imposing dynamic process conditions combined with process modeling and parameter estimation, the intrinsic nitrite half saturation constant was identified to be as low as 35 µg-N L- 1. This was confirmed to be a stable value in the tested pH range of 6. 8 - 7. 5. Using the same system, in Chapter 3 the stoichiometric and kinetic properties of a suspended anammox enrichment culture were investigated at decreasing solid retention times. This procedure enabled the maximum growth rate (µmax) of the anammox enrichment culture to increase to 0. 334 d- 1, which is four times higher than previously reported in literature and almost 60 % higher than observed in Chapter 2. Even though researchers have speculated about the possibility of higher rates before, these speculations were always based on indirect measurements of the kinetic properties. Herewith Chapter 3 reports the first direct experimental evidence for a significant increase in growth rate of an anammox enrichment culture. Since the biomass yield of the enrichment culture established is largely comparable to previous studies, it can be concluded that the increased growth rate results from an equivalent increase in biomass specific electron transfer capacity. Detailed molecular analysis did not reveal either a shift in dominant anammox strain nor major mutations in the dominant strain, suggesting that the actual reasons for the increase in electron transfer capacity is due to small changes in the metabolic machinery. The dominant strain throughout this experiment was closely related to Candidatus Brocadia Sp. 40 (99 % similarity). In this study anammox bacteria were cultivated applying a novel selection strategy based on the maximization of the electron transfer capacity demonstrating that maximum growth rate is not an intrinsic process property but that it can be increased significantly when the adequate cultivation conditions are imposed. The anammox enrichment became faster through training showing kinetics comparable with other chemolithoautotrophs and it is thereby concluded that anammox can no longer be regarded as intrinsically slow growing microorganism. Nitrite {{is one of the main}} substrates of the anammox metabolism, but it is also an inhibitor. Its negative effect on anammox activity has been reported widely during the past decade. Although the adverse effect is clear, conflicting reports exist on the level at which it occurs and its reversible/irreversible nature. In order to elucidate this important aspect, an in-depth study on nitrite inhibition was performed in which the influence of environmental factors was evaluated (Chapter 4). Anammox activity was measured in anammox granules by continuously monitored standardized manometric batch tests extending the interpretation by evaluation of lag times, maximum conversion rates during the tests and substrates/product conversion ratios. The granules, dominated by anammox organisms belonging to the Brocadia type, where sampled from a single-stage anammox full-scale reactor. The observed 50 % activity inhibition for nitrite (IC 50) was 0. 4 g-N L- 1. It was shown that biomass relatively quickly (and totally) recovers from high nitrite concentrations. The recovery after exposure indicates that the adverse effect of nitrite is reversible and thus inhibitory rather than toxic in nature. The effect of the presence of ammonium and oxygen during nitrite exposure has also been evaluated. Similarities between exposures at three different pH values suggest that nitrite rather than nitrous acid is the actual inhibiting compound. Overall the results reported in Chapter 4 further underline that the anammox process can be a stable process not prone to temporarily adverse effects of oxygen and nitrite in the reactors. From our experience and previous observations we speculate that cultivation conditions and status of aggregation influence the inhibitory effect of nitrite and that in several cases where high nitrite is reported as a cause of activity loss, it might well be that activity loss has resulted in the accumulation of high nitrite concentrations rather than causing them. The temperature effect on anammox activity is a crucial aspect that needs to be clarified for the successful implementation of anammox related processes at mainstream conditions. Lower operating temperatures in fact, together with lower ammonium concentrations and the demand for high and stable nitrogen removal efficiency, represent the main challenges to overcome for this appealing new frontier of the waste water treatment field. In Chapter 5 is reported the short-term effect of temperature on the maximum biomass specific activity of anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria as evaluated by means of batch tests. The experiments were performed on anammox biomass sampled from two full-scale reactors and two lab-scale reactors, all characterized by different reactor configurations and operating conditions. The results indicate that in the temperature range of 10 - 30 °C the temperature dependency for the anammox conversion cannot be accurately modeled by one single Arrhenius coefficient (i. e. ?) as typically applied for other biological processes. The temperature effect is increasing at lower temperatures, complicating the implementation of a stable mainstream process in winter conditions.|$|R
