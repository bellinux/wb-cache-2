40|$|Corresponding author. Rational Inattention and Portfolio Selection Costly {{information}} {{acquisition and}} processing make it rational for investors to obtain and process important economic news only at discrete times. With a novel portfolio selection model that is solved in an explicit form, {{we show that}} this rational inattention to important news significantly changes the optimal trading strategy and may make investors overinvest or underinvest. In addition, even for an investor with non-log preference the optimal trading strategy is myopic with respect to news <b>frequency</b> and news <b>accuracy,</b> {{in the sense that}} it only depends on current news and is independent of the <b>frequency</b> and <b>accuracy</b> of any future news. We then use an empirically calibrated model to conduct an extensive comparative statics analysis on the optimal news <b>frequency,</b> optimal news <b>accuracy,</b> and trading strategy. In particular, we find that the optimal news frequency is nonmonotonic in news accuracy and investment horizon. Furthermore, when both news <b>frequency</b> and news <b>accuracy</b> are endogenized, an investor with a higher risk aversion or a longer investment horizon chooses less frequent but more accurate news updates...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFrequency is a {{standard}} of electronic power quality, and is important parameter of electronic power system running state. System's frequency reflects active power supply and demand balance's basic state of electronic power system. The frequency fluctuation of an electronic power system is mainly affected by 10 s∼ 3 min pulse sub-component load or continuous sub-component in very slowly changing. So, adopting frequency software tracking method is very necessary. Because virtual instrument technology can largely reduce hardware cost in completing frequency tracking, and add instrument flexibility, This system uses virtual instrument LabVIEW to design a kind of frequency tracking measurement frame diagram procedure, and through system simulation, we prove this method of calculating <b>frequency's</b> <b>accuracy</b> by using virtual instrument technology...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{measurement}} of power network running frequency {{is an important part}} of power quality test. For a variety of disturbances, anti-interfering and accuracy are required for the algorithm for frequency detecting. Benefited from FFT and efficient DSP chips, the Fourier transform algorithm can be used for reliable and efficient analysis of power network frequency. However, the spectrum leakage of FFT causes impact on the <b>frequency</b> detection <b>accuracy,</b> and the DSP's processing capacity is also limited. Therefore, vector decomposition window-added FFT algorithm based on fixed sampling rate and FFT points is discussed in this paper to handle the problem of impact caused by frequency leakage and to improve <b>frequency</b> detection <b>accuracy.</b> Good results can be achieved by using this algorithm as shown in the experiment...|$|R

5000|$|The {{use of an}} {{additional}} entropy coding tool, and higher <b>frequency</b> <b>accuracy</b> (due to the larger number of frequency sub-bands used by MP3) explains why MP3 does not need as high a bit rate as MP2 to get an acceptable audio quality. Conversely, MP2 shows a better behavior than MP3 in the time domain, due to its lower frequency resolution. This implies less codec time delay — which can make editing audio simpler — as well as [...] "ruggedness" [...] and resistance to errors which may occur during the digital recording process, or during transmission errors.|$|E

50|$|GPSDOs {{typically}} phase-align {{the internal}} flywheel oscillator to the GPS signal by using dividers {{to generate a}} 1PPS signal from the reference oscillator, then phase comparing this 1PPS signal to the GPS-generated 1PPS signal and using the phase differences to control the local oscillator frequency in small adjustments via the tracking loop. This differentiates GPSDOs from their cousins NCOs (numerically controlled oscillator). Rather than disciplining an oscillator via frequency adjustments, NCOs typically use a free-running, low-cost crystal oscillator and adjust the output phase by digitally lengthening or shortening the output phase many times per second in large phase steps assuring that on average the number of phase transitions per second is aligned to the GPS receiver reference source. This guarantees <b>frequency</b> <b>accuracy</b> {{at the expense of}} high phase noise and jitter, a degradation that true GPSDOs do not suffer.|$|E
