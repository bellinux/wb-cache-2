5|$|Although {{the initial}} {{attempts}} to dismantle or tow the stern to sea failed, the State of Oregon still intended {{to see the}} remainder of the vessel removed from the beach. In 2006, the state's lawsuit against the ship's owners was settled, clearing the legal obstacles that prevented removal and providing the funds necessary to finance the project.

40|$|The {{overall project}} {{objective}} is to demonstrate improved reliability and increased performance made possible by <b>deeply</b> <b>embedding</b> instrumentation and controls (I&C) in nuclear power plant components. The project is employing a highly instrumented canned rotor, magnetic bearing, fluoride salt pump as its I&C technology demonstration vehicle. The project s focus is not primarily on pump design, but instead is on methods to <b>deeply</b> <b>embed</b> I&C within a pump system. However, because the I&C is intimately part of the basic millisecond-by-millisecond functioning of the pump, the I&C design cannot proceed in isolation from the {{other aspects of the}} pump. The pump will not function if the characteristics of the I&C are not embedded within the design because the I&C enables performance of the basic function rather than merely monitoring quasi-stable performance. Traditionally, I&C has been incorporated in nuclear power plant (NPP) components after their design is nearly complete; adequate performance was obtained through over-design. This report describes the progress and status of the project and provides a conceptual design overview for the embedded I&C pump...|$|R

5|$|In soft corals, {{there is}} no stony {{skeleton}} but the tissues are often toughened {{by the presence of}} tiny skeletal elements known as sclerites, which are made from calcium carbonate. Soft corals are very variable in form and most are colonial. A few soft corals are stolonate, but the polyps of most are connected by sheets of coenosarc. In some species this is thick and the polyps are <b>deeply</b> <b>embedded.</b> Some soft corals are encrusting or form lobes. Others are tree-like or whip-like and have a central axial skeleton embedded in the tissue matrix. This is composed either of a fibrous protein called gorgonin or of a calcified material. In both stony and soft corals, the polyps can be retracted, with stony corals relying on their hard skeleton and cnidocytes for defence against predators, with soft corals generally relying on chemical defences in the form of toxic substances present in the tissues known as terpenoids.|$|E
5|$|Raising the Mary Rose meant {{overcoming}} {{a number}} of delicate problems {{that had never been}} encountered before. The raising of the Swedish warship Vasa 1959–61 was the only comparable precedent, but it had been a relatively straightforward operation since the hull was completely intact and rested upright on the seabed. It had been raised with basically the same methods as were in use in Tudor England: cables were slung under the hull and attached to two pontoons {{on either side of the}} ship which was then gradually raised and towed into shallower waters. Only one third of the Mary Rose was intact and she lay <b>deeply</b> <b>embedded</b> in mud. If the hull were raised in the traditional way, there was no guarantee that it would have enough structural strength to hold together out of water. Many suggestions for raising the ship were discarded, including the construction of a cofferdam around the wreck site, filling the ship with small buoyant objects (such as ping pong balls) or even pumping brine into the seabed and freezing it so that it would float and take the hull with it. After lengthy discussions it was decided in February 1980 that the hull would first be emptied of all its contents and strengthened with steel braces and frames. It would then be lifted to the surface with floating sheerlegs attached to nylon strops passing under the hull and transferred to a cradle. It was also decided that the ship would be recovered before the end of the diving season in 1982. If the wreck stayed uncovered any longer it risked irreversible damage from biological decay and tidal scouring.|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} a formal verification approach that permits the mechanical verification of circuit generators and hardware optimization procedures, as well as existing hardware designs. Our approach is based on <b>deeply</b> <b>embedding</b> the DE 2 HDL into the ACL 2 logic [3]; we use the ACL 2 theorem-proving system to verify the circuit generators. During circuit generation, a circuit generator may generate circuits based on variety of non-functional criteria. For example, a circuit generator may produce different structural circuit descriptions depending on wire lengths, circuit primitives, target technology, and circuit topology. In this paper, we show how we have applied the DE 2 system to a simple circuit generator—the n-bit ripple-carry adder. We then show how we have applied the DE 2 system to the verification of components of the TRIPS microprocessor design. ...|$|R

Rather than building atomicity locally, i. e. declaring some code blocks as atomic blocks and leaving other code segments with no guarantee of any atomicity property, we build it in globally, so that a form of atomicity, quantized atomicity, ubiquitously exists at all program points. We justify our approach both from a theoretical basis by showing that a formal representation, KernelCoqa, has provable quantized atomicity properties, and by implementing CoqaJava, a Java extension incorporating all of the Coqa features. ...|$|R

30|$|The VI-Suite <b>deeply</b> <b>embeds</b> {{the ability}} to analyse the {{performance}} of architectural and geospatial forms within the 3 D content creation suite Blender. This approach attempts {{to bridge the gap}} between analysis and digital design software. Using Blender mesh geometry (faces or vertices) as the specifier of calculation points within the scene means calculation points can be manipulated with the same level of flexibility, using the same tools, as conventional Blender mesh geometry. This makes it easy to move between scales; calculating over coarse grids for large area analyses, finer grids for detailed architectural studies or a combination of the two. Using mesh geometry as a repository and visualiser for the calculated data also offers the possibility to visualise results with the same flexibility and control as with conventional Blender meshes offering transparency, wireframes, animations etc and even allows for results planes to be exported from Blender as mesh geometry, or interchanged between Blender files. This latter capability would, for example, allow multiple result sets to be visualised together for comparative purposes within a single Blender scene.|$|R
40|$|Incorporating a {{significant}} amount of technology into a classroom is an important, but extremely difficult task. In this paper we describe the next generation of the UCSB digital classroom, called the Collaborative Technologies Lab (CTL). The primary goal of the CTL is to investigate the challenges of deploying technology for technology's sake. We feel that without the ability to deploy a large amount of technology and offer robust functionality, the whole idea of enhanced learning environments becomes marginalized. Therefore, it is critical to understand the challenges of <b>deeply</b> <b>embedding</b> technology in a classroom. Based on experience in building and using the CTL, in this paper we propose a demarcation point between program production and content encoding. This demarcation point offers the advantage of breaking a large technical problem into smaller, easier-to-solve problems. The demarcation point also has the advantage of being able to separate complex functions along common lines of expertise. One skilled in production need not worry about the technology of the encoding systems and one skilled in technology need not worry about the ascetics of program production...|$|R

The sensor design includes four components: mass block housing, middle cylinder, connector housing, optical fibers and mass-block. The block housing is to hold the mass block and guide its sliding. Two blocks are designed to stretch sensing optical fiber when the block housing has inclination. The sensing optical fiber are required for performing sensing task in a ela range.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new language}} model, Coqa, for <b>deeply</b> <b>embedding</b> concurrent programming into objects. Every program written in our language has built-in the desirable behaviors of atomicity, mutual exclusion, and race freedom. Such a design inverts the default mode of e. g.

Coqa takes advantage of basic object-oriented notions to express important concurrent programming primitives, resulting in a powerful but concise model that includes thread creation, shared object access and open nesting. A key property of our model is the notion of quantized atomicity: all concurrent program executions can be viewed as being divided into quantum regions of atomic execution, greatly reducing the number of interleavings to consider. The language design draws from different schools of concurrent language design, especially Actors, and constructs a unified design close to mainstream object-oriented programming practice.

25|$|A much milder acid than tartaric and malic, {{lactic acid}} is often {{associated}} with “milky” flavors in wine and is the primary acid of yogurt and sauerkraut. It is produced during winemaking by lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which includes three genera: Oenococcus, Pediococcus and Lactobacillus. These bacteria convert both sugar and malic acid into lactic acid, the latter through MLF. This process can be beneficial for some wines, adding complexity and softening the harshness of malic acidity, but it can generate off flavors and turbidity in others. Some strains of LAB can produce biogenic amines, such as histamine, tyramine and putrescine, which may be a cause of red wine headaches in some wine drinkers. Winemakers wishing to control or prevent MLF can use sulfur dioxide to stun the bacteria. Racking the wine quickly off its lees will also help control the bacteria, since lees are a vital food source for them. The winemakers must also be very careful of what wine barrels and winemaking equipment to which the wine is exposed, because of the bacteria's ability to <b>deeply</b> <b>embed</b> themselves within wood fibers. A wine barrel that has completed one successful malolactic fermentation will almost always induce MLF in every wine stored in it from then on.|$|R
