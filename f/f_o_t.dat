60|$|The last {{farewell}} was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far {{and near}} the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the gloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums punctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening claps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up the ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its supernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. A torrential rain poured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the bared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the lowest computation five hundred thousand persons. A posse of Dublin Metropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person maintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and reed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on their blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared {{to us from the}} cradle by Speranza's plaintive muse. Special quick excursion trains and upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our country cousins of whom there were large contingents. Considerable amusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and M-ll-g-n who sang The Night before Larry was stretched in their usual mirth-provoking fashion. Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies. The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day's entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat. The viceregal houseparty which included many wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most favourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign delegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated on a tribune directly opposite. The delegation, present in full force, consisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed doyen of the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a powerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petitépatant, the Grandjoker Vladinmire Pokethankertscheff, the Archjoker Leopold Rudolph von Schwanzenbad-Hodenthaler, Countess Marha Virága Kisászony Putrápesthi, Hiram Y. Bomboost, Count Athanatos Karamelopulos, Ali Baba Backsheesh Rahat Lokum Effendi, Senor Hidalgo Caballero Don Pecadillo y Palabras y Paternoster de la Malora de la Malaria, Hokopoko Harakiri, Hi Hung Chang, Olaf Kobberkeddelsen, Mynheer Trik van Trumps, Pan Poleaxe Paddyrisky, Goosepond Prhklstr Kratchinabritchisitch, Borus Hupinkoff, Herr Hurhausdirektorpresident Hans Chuechli-Steuerli, Nationalgymnasiummuseumsanatoriumandsuspensoriumsordinaryprivatdocent -generalhistoryspecialprofessordoctor Kriegfried Ueberallgemein. All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness. An animated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the <b>F.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>T.</b> E. I. as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct date of the birth of Ireland's patron saint. In the course of the argument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots, meatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps of pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged. The baby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from Booterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties. The readywitted ninefooter's suggestion at once appealed to all and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden was heartily congratulated by all the F.O.T.E.I., several of whom were bleeding profusely. Commendatore Beninobenone having been extricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained by his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles secreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the affray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing them to their senses. The objects (which included several hundred ladies' and gentlemen's gold and silver watches) were promptly restored to their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.|$|E
40|$|The {{usefulness}} of fungus culture filtrates and fusaric acid as selecting agents for Fusarium resistance breeding in tulip was examined on in vitro cultures of shoots and embryonic calli of seven tulip genotypes differing in resistance to Fusarium oxysporum Schlecht. f. sp. tulipae Apt. (<b>F.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>t.)</b> and four virulent <b>F.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>t.</b> isolates. Fusaric acid influenced the shoot growth of all cultivars {{tested in a}} similar way, irrespectively of their greenhouse resistance to basal rot. Also, the sensitivity of calli of the cultivars studied to fusaric acid did not correspond with their resistance to <b>F.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>t.</b> evaluated in the greenhouse screening. The phytotoxity of <b>F.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>t.</b> culture filtrates did not depend on their fusaric acid contents. There was a negative correlation between cultivar's resistance to <b>F.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>t</b> in greenhouse tests and the sensitivity of their shoots to fungus culture filtrates in in vitro tests. This indicates that defence mechanism against <b>F.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>t.</b> in tulip tissue may have a nature of hypersensitive response. Considering {{the results of our}} study, it may be concluded that the use of fusaric acid or fungus culture filtrates for the in vitro selection of somaclones resistant to <b>F.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>t.</b> in tulip is not feasible...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{infection}} process and ethylene production by Fusarium oxysporum (Schlect.) f. sp. tulipae Apt. (<b>F.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>t.)</b> in tulip bulbs after harvest. This dissertation aimed: 1) to develop screening assays {{to study the}} infection and ethylene evolution of <b>F.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>t.</b> in tulip bulbs, 2) to determine the degree of resistance to Fusarium between several cutlivars, and members of lineages of cultivar sports, and 3) to generate a profile of metabolites of two cultivars (one susceptible, and one resistant) involved in the ethylene biosynthesis pathway of <b>F.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>t.,</b> and compounds involved in confering resistance to this pathogen. Chapter 2 presents a literature review. Chapter 3 describes a multi-step procedure to isolate, characterize and identify Fusarium strains allegedly causing Fusarium rot in tulip bulbs. Chapter 4 evaluates various inoculation methods on {{the time course of}} fresh weight loss and ethylene production by <b>F.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>t.</b> Moist incubation conditions free of condensation led to healthy fungal development. Change in fresh weight {{can be used as a}} predictor of ethylene production by the fungus. Chapter 5 explores the correlation between ethylene evolution, visual infection rating, and FW loss of 38 cultivars and 2 species when inoculated with <b>F.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>t.</b> A Disease Severity Index (DSI) was developed to determine the degree of resistance to <b>F.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>t.</b> Cultivars and species ranged from resistant to susceptible. Time lapse videos show the infection process by <b>F.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>t.</b> in a susceptible cultivar and fungal growth suppression in a resistant cultivar. Chapter 6 presents the ethylene production in-vitro by <b>F.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>t.</b> in organs explants, and ethylene production in organs from whole inoculated bulbs. Results in organs from whole inoculated bulbs were similar to the in-vitro assay, however, biological contamination created experimental noise. Amino acid content and tulipaline-A in crude extracts from organs of two cultivars before inoculation did not correspond to ethylene production and fungal biomass of <b>F.</b> <b>o.</b> <b>t.</b> We postulate that tulipaline-A is a phytoanticipin in tulip bulbs, which in resistant cultivars may increase to fungitoxic levels under pathogen attack as a result of tuliposide breakdown by enzyme activity or chemical depolymerization by pH change in the tissue...|$|E

Two measurements of drama space are allocated: s p a c e <b>o</b> <b>f</b> s <b>t</b> <b>o</b> r y and s p a c e <b>o</b> <b>f</b> p l <b>o</b> <b>t.</b> The space of plot of the drama, as a whole, corresponds to space of “a narrative act” in an epic work. In t h e c l a s s i c a l drama (from antiquity till the 19 th century) authors didn’t focus {{the attention of the}} audience on the space of plot. The author of the article comes to a conclusion that in the non-classical drama the emphasis is placed on the space of plot. In the article, ways of the organization of art spaces in the works of I. Vyrypayev, V. Sigarev, S. Reshetnikov, E. Grishkovets are examined. Also semantic heterogeneity of art space in the modern drama is investigated. Semantic oppositions “top and bottom”, “private and social” come to light. The author of this article draws a conclusion that key situations in topography of modern plays occupy “marginal” spaces. The author of the article draws a conclusion that in the forefront in modern plays there are marginal (boundary) spaces (the thrown houses, toilets, cemeteries, waste grounds, etc.). The importance of these spaces is defined that they reflect a condition of a character. This condition is defined as identity crisis. Кемеровский государственный университет 317 - 33...|$|R
