CRPF MPVs in Naxalite areas are limited to evacuating casualties.|$|E
25|$|The Western High Plateau {{was once}} heavily forested. However, {{repeated}} cutting and burning {{by human beings}} <b>has</b> <b>forced</b> <b>the</b> forest back to areas along the waterways and has allowed grasslands to expand into the area. Sudan savanna forms the dominant vegetation. This consists of grassfields—leading to the name Bamenda grassfields around the city of Bamenda—and short shrubs and trees that shed their foliage {{during the dry season}} as a defence against brush fires and dry weather. Raffia palms grow in the valleys and depressions.|$|E

Many degreasing chemical alternatives are being promoted such as Ensolv and Leksol; however, each of these is based on n-propyl bromide which carries an R60 risk phrase of May impair fertility, and they would not be a legally acceptable substitute.|$|E

25|$|Due to no {{funding from}} the state of Georgia and its limited funding from Fulton, Clayton and DeKalb counties, MARTA has {{struggled}} for many years to provide adequate service to the metropolitan area. As a result, MARTA has gained a notorious reputation throughout the metro Atlanta area for being ineffective and inconvenient. Many people who own cars avoid using the system altogether while residents in suburban areas usually drive their car to a MARTA rail station (instead of using bus service) if their job is near an adjacent one. MARTA's financial structure (being tied to a 1% sales tax) <b>has</b> <b>forced</b> <b>the</b> agency to cut services during times of economic depression, further resulting in complaints about the inconvenience and inadequacy of MARTA services.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{efforts to}} {{introduce}} intensified crop production {{with an emphasis}} on rice grown year after year in the same field, have been somewhat successful. Rice cultivation in this historically cold region has been made easier in recent decades due to global warming. This is largely due to the exhaustion of Zafimaniry land for traditional swidden agriculture, which <b>has</b> <b>forced</b> <b>the</b> Zafimaniry {{to find a way to}} adopt rice cultivation despite the unadapted nature of the mountainous terrain where they live. The terrain and climate require highly complex terracing and irrigation systems that the local population lacks the knowledge to build, so they are required to hire Betsileo specialists to construct their paddies. Most cash income the Zafimaniry use is invested in the construction of terraces for rice cultivation.|$|E
25|$|Aix-les-Bains {{has nearly}} 500 shops. These are, {{for the largest}} number, present in the town centre. Merchants benefit from the {{attractiveness}} of the geographical situation of the commune with {{the proximity of the}} lake and the Massif des Bauges, but also thanks to the casino. However, its aging image as well as competition from neighbouring communes tend to undermine the Aix shops. Indeed, the peripheral communes such as Tresserve, Grésy-sur-Aix, Albens or even Le Bourget-du-Lac attract ever slightly more local clientele. On the other hand, the Chambéry area is facing competition from the area of activity of Les Landiers, where most of the big names are, such as Darty, la Halle aux vêtements, Feu vert, but also the large Carrefour hypermarket. This presence <b>has</b> <b>forced</b> <b>the</b> town of Chambéry to revitalize its own town centre. Aix-les-Bains shops have, in this general situation, struggled to survive and attract potential customers.|$|E
25|$|Set in {{a fictional}} {{version of the}} {{industrial}} age, the story begins with William Blackmore, a professional chimney sweep, leaving his family {{to take a job}} under a powerful industrialist, the Baron. A few months later, with William having failed to return and the family deep in debt, the four Blackmore children (Albert, Agatha, Abigail, and Archibald) are forced into apprenticeships by the Baron's agents, leaving the youngest, Charlie, alone with his mother Agnes. A few weeks later, a pigeon arrives with a letter from Albert, who reveals that the Baron has split up him and his siblings, forcing them to work as slaves. Charlie subsequently sets out to rescue them, recruiting a friendly hobo named Levi to help him set up a hideout in an abandoned section of the Royal Train Station, where a strike <b>has</b> <b>forced</b> <b>the</b> station's management to use Albert and other children as coal shovelers.|$|E

25|$|Residential {{consumers}} {{outside the}} PRA areas and thus likely {{not to be}} among the poorest, are charged below-cost electricity prices for consumption below 700 kWh/month, a very high threshold by international standards. About 80% of residential users outside the PRA areas fall into this category. This subsidy is drawn from the Tariff Stabilization Fund (FET), which was designed to reduce the impact of high oil prices. The financial burden in this case is transferred to the distribution companies, which have found themselves unable to cover their costs in a scenario of rising oil prices, low efficiency and a limited customer base that could be charged to finance the cross-subsidy. This situation <b>has</b> <b>forced</b> <b>the</b> government to provide much higher than expected subsidies to the sector, which in turn translates into reduced ability to finance investments in other key sectors such as health and education. The government has started to reduce cross-subsidies gradually, with the final objective of limiting them to households with monthly consumption below 200 kWh, which is closer to thresholds for subsidized residential electricity encountered in other countries.|$|E
500|$|Since 1870, koalas {{have been}} {{introduced}} to several coastal and offshore islands, including Kangaroo Island and French Island. Their numbers have significantly increased, and since the islands are not large enough to sustain such high koala numbers, overbrowsing has become a problem. In the 1920s, Lewis initiated a program of large-scale relocation and rehabilitation programs to transfer koalas whose habitat had become fragmented or reduced to new regions, {{with the intent of}} eventually returning them to their former range. For example, in 1930–31, 165 koalas were translocated to Quail Island. After a period of population growth, and subsequent overbrowsing of gum trees on the island, about 1,300 animals were released into mainland areas in 1944. [...] The practice of translocating koalas became commonplace; Victorian State manager Peter Menkorst estimated that from 1923 to 2006, about 25,000 animals were translocated to more than 250 release sites across Victoria. Since the 1990s, government agencies have tried to control their numbers by culling, but public and international outcry <b>has</b> <b>forced</b> <b>the</b> use of translocation and sterilisation, instead.|$|E
500|$|Nesbitt {{was married}} to Sonia Forbes-Adam, the {{daughter}} of Reverend Sir Timothy Forbes Adam. The two met when Nesbitt went to the final call-back for Hamlet at Loughborough Hall in 1989, and they soon began dating. They split up for {{a year after the}} release of Hear My Song but reunited and married in 1994. They have since had two daughters, Peggy and Mary (both of whom appeared in the final two Hobbit movies as the daughters of Bard the Bowman). Nesbitt's three sisters all became teachers. In 2002, a Sunday tabloid published an interview with a legal secretary who claimed to have had a two-month affair with Nesbitt. Shortly afterwards, another tabloid story revealed an affair with a prostitute, who claimed Nesbitt had boasted of liaisons with his Cold Feet co-star Kimberley Joseph, and Amanda Brunker, a former Miss Ireland. Commenting on the publication of details about his personal life, Nesbitt has said he feared that he would lose his marriage, though the exposing of his [...] "dual life" [...] allowed him to [...] "take a long and considered look" [...] at himself. In October 2013, Nesbitt announced {{that he and his wife}} Sonia Forbes-Adam would separate from each other after 19 years. The couple says that the filming of The Hobbit Trilogy <b>has</b> <b>forced</b> <b>the</b> couple to live separately for the past two years. The split came as a mutual decision and the couple says that infidelity was not one of the reasons for their decision. He is the proud father of BUCS 10,000m women's record holder Jenny Nesbitt.|$|E
