5|$|In {{the earlier}} {{part of his}} life, Yeats {{was a member of}} the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Due to the {{escalating}} tension of the political scene, Yeats distanced himself from the core political activism in the midst of the Easter Rising, even <b>holding</b> <b>back</b> his poetry inspired by the events until 1920.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, Hellenic Nomarchy {{points to}} the ongoing {{successful}} struggle of the Serbs against the Ottoman rule, which began in 1804. The author states that the Orthodox clergy was <b>holding</b> <b>back</b> the national aspirations of the Greek people, while the educated and dynamic elements of Greek society and the mercantile diaspora should return to Greece and join the movement of national liberation.|$|E
5|$|In August 1989, Cranor {{proposed}} {{amendments to}} the existing 1976 contract for US franchisees: PepsiCo could take over weak franchises, existing restaurants would not be safeguarded against competition from new outlets, and PepsiCo would {{have the right to}} increase royalty fees. The contract proved controversial amongst franchisees, who countered with a lawsuit, and the issue was not resolved until 1996. PepsiCo was accused of behaving in an imperious manner towards franchisees, who it believed were <b>holding</b> <b>back</b> the firm's growth, while the franchisees believed they had been the backbone of the company during a succession of indifferent corporate owners.|$|E
50|$|A {{retaining}} {{wall is a}} structure that <b>holds</b> <b>back</b> earth.

Team World took an early {{lead in the}} first day of the event, but Team North America roared back in the next few days, dominating in the team, mixed doubles, and singles competitions to hold a large lead. Team North America clinched the cup in the second round of skins play after <b>holding</b> <b>back</b> a late Team World comeback, giving Team North America a 5–4 edge in the overall cup record. Team North America's win ensured that no defending champion to date would successfully defend its title from the previous Cup.|$|E
5|$|The Pictish {{relationship}} with Rome {{appears to have}} been less overtly hostile than their Caledonian predecessors, at least in the beginning. There were no more pitched battles and conflict was generally limited to raiding parties {{from both sides of the}} frontier until immediately prior to and after the Roman retreat from Britannia. Their apparent success in <b>holding</b> <b>back</b> Roman forces cannot be explained solely with reference to the remoteness of Caledonia or the difficulties of the terrain. In part it may have been due to the difficulties encountered in subjugating a population that did not conform to the strictures of local governance that Roman power usually depended on to operate through.|$|E
5|$|The high US {{demand for}} {{tickets for the}} tour, and the {{difficulty}} which some fans had in getting them, brought attention to rapidity with which tickets turned up on the higher-priced secondary market. Some tickets were being resold on the secondary market for prices of up to $7,500. Additionally, pre-sale passwords were being sold on eBay for bids of up to $400. Although some artists {{were known to be}} <b>holding</b> <b>back</b> tickets from general sale and delivering them straight into the secondary market, Live Nation said that U2 did not engage in this practice.|$|E

5|$|On July 29 the 1st Battalion {{suffered}} {{about 60}} casualties from North Korean mortar fire. As {{the men were}} preparing their perimeter defense for the night, a general panic arose, {{for reasons that are}} still unclear. Most of them deserted their positions in a state of alarm. Colonel White found himself, the 77th Combat Engineer Company, and a battery of the 159th Field Artillery Battalion all that was left in the front line. He had to personally reorganize the battalion as many of his officers were unable to get the men to listen to them. As White tried to rally his men, the field artillery maintained a sustained barrage of fire to slow the North Koreans advance. That night alone the artillery fired 3,000 rounds in <b>holding</b> <b>back</b> the North Koreans.|$|E
5|$|American trumpeter Chet Baker {{recorded}} the tune in 1987 for the documentary Let's Get Lost (1989) {{and it was}} released on the soundtrack album. He also covered it in concert on June 14, 1987, in Tokyo, creating an extended version totaling seven minutes and fifty-three seconds. After his death in 1988, it was released on his posthumous album Chet Baker in Tokyo (1988). At a 1998 benefit concert for the Walden Woods Project in Concord, Massachusetts, ska musician Gwen Stefani sang it alongside a jazz orchestra. It was later included on the accompanying promotional CD for AT customers, titled Stormy Weather (1998). Other renditions were made by Kate Dimbleby and Jimmy Scott for their 1998 albums, Good Vibrations and <b>Holding</b> <b>Back</b> the Years, respectively. The Reputation featured it on their eponymous debut album in 2002, followed with covers performed by Everything but the Girl and Alison Moyet in 2003 and 2004, respectively.|$|E
5|$|At {{the first}} round of pit stops, Hamilton had a lead of nearly 20seconds over Massa, and fuelled longer than all the other drivers in the points-scoring {{positions}} when he pitted on lap18. Coming out of the pits, Hamilton made an error and was passed by Trulli. The two drivers then nearly collided at the hairpin, with Hamilton <b>holding</b> <b>back</b> {{for the rest of the}} lap waiting for Trulli to pit. Trulli's teammate Glock stayed out on the track longer than all of the other drivers except Barrichello and Piquet, meaning that when he pitted, he was actually in third position and rejoined the race in eighth. Hamilton regained the lead by lap22 after Massa, Kovalainen, Trulli and Räikkönen made their pit stops, and had in the region of an 11second lead over Massa at the half-way stage of the race. Behind the leaders, fourth-placed Kubica was beginning to catch Kovalainen in third, while Trulli, Räikkönen, Alonso and Vettel battled over the final four point-scoring places.|$|E

5|$|Even if the ARBiH had not {{provided}} aid, the HV {{would almost certainly}} have defeated the Banija Corps on its own, albeit at greater cost. The lack of reserves was the ARSK's key weakness that was exploited by the HV and the ARBiH since the ARSK's static defence could not cope with fast-paced attacks. The ARSK military was unable to check outflanking manoeuvres and their Special Units Corps failed as a mobile reserve, <b>holding</b> <b>back</b> the HV's 1st Guards Brigade south of Slunj {{for less than a}} single day. The ARSK traditionally counted on the VRS and the Yugoslav military as its strategic reserve, but the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina immobilized the VRS reserves and Yugoslavia did not intervene militarily as Milošević did not order it to do so. Even if he had wished to intervene, the speed of the battle would have allowed a very limited time for Yugoslavia to deploy appropriate reinforcements to support the ARSK.|$|E
5|$|The Path of the Wizard {{continues}} {{immediately after}} {{the events of the}} first level. The remains of the Uruk-hai and orc army flee into Fangorn Forest. However, within the forest, the Ents, led by Treebeard, have awoken and joined the fight against Sauron. Gandalf helps the ents as they destroy the rest of the army, and then assists them in bringing down a dam <b>holding</b> <b>back</b> the River Isen. This floods Isengard, trapping Saruman (Christopher Lee), who had joined forces with Sauron, in his tower, Orthanc. Gandalf and Pippin (Billy Boyd) then head to Minas Tirith, capital of Gondor, leaving Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and the Rohirrim to follow them. Gandalf has gone ahead of the others because Sauron mistakenly believes that Pippin has the Ring, and Gandalf plans to use this confusion to distract Sauron as Frodo and Sam are led by Gollum (Andy Serkis) towards Mount Doom to destroy the Ring. In Minas Tirth, Gandalf helps repulse the enemies from the walls for a time, but eventually, they break through the city's defenses. Gandalf and the soldiers of Minas Tirith then retreat to a courtyard, where they must defend the fleeing civilians from the enemy. Once the people are safely inside, Gandalf can do little but await the arrival of Aragorn.|$|E
