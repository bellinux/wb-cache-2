60|$|A {{couple of}} days {{afterward}} {{he asked her to}} come and see his house. The visit had already been proposed, but it had been put off in consequence of his mother's illness. She was a constant invalid, and she had passed these recent years, very patiently, in a great flowered arm-chair at her bedroom window. Lately, for some days, she had been unable to see any one; but now she was better, and she sent the Baroness a very civil message. Acton had wished their visitor to come to dinner; but Madame M; auunster preferred to begin with a simple call. She had reflected that if she should go to dinner Mr. Wentworth and his daughters would also be asked, and it had seemed to her that the peculiar character of the occasion would be best preserved in a tete-a-tete with her host. Why the occasion should have a peculiar character she explained to no one. As far as any one could see, it was simply very pleasant. Acton came for her and drove her to his door, an operation which was rapidly performed. His house the Baroness mentally pronounced a very good one; more articulately, she declared that it was enchanting. It was large and square and painted brown; it stood in a well-kept shrubbery, and was approached, from the gate, by a short drive. It was, moreover, a much more modern dwelling than Mr. Wentworth's, and was more redundantly upholstered and expensively ornamented. The Baroness perceived that her entertainer had analyzed material comfort to a sufficiently fine point. And then he possessed the most delightful chinoiseries--trophies of his sojourn in the Celestial Empire: pagodas of ebony and cabinets of ivory; sculptured monsters, grinning and leering on chimney-pieces, in front of beautifully figured hand-screens; porcelain dinner-sets, gleaming behind the glass doors of mahogany buffets; large screens, in corners, covered with tense silk and embroidered with mandarins and dragons. These things were scattered all over the house, and they gave Eugenia a pretext for a complete <b>domiciliary</b> <b>visit.</b> She liked it, she enjoyed it; she thought it a very nice place. It had a mixture of the homely and the liberal, and though it was almost a museum, the large, little-used rooms were as fresh and clean as a well-kept dairy. Lizzie Acton told her that she dusted all the pagodas and other curiosities every day with her own hands; and the Baroness answered that she was evidently a household fairy. Lizzie had not at all the look of a young lady who dusted things; she wore such pretty dresses and had such delicate fingers that it was difficult to imagine her immersed in sordid cares. She came to meet Madame M; auunster on her arrival, but she said nothing, or almost nothing, and the Baroness again reflected--she had had occasion to do so before--that American girls had no manners. She disliked this little American girl, and she was quite prepared to learn that she had failed to commend herself to Miss Acton. Lizzie struck her as positive and explicit almost to pertness; and the idea of her combining the apparent incongruities of a taste for housework and the wearing of fresh, Parisian-looking dresses suggested the possession of a dangerous energy. It was a source of irritation to the Baroness that in this country it should seem to matter whether a little girl were a trifle less or a trifle more of a nonentity; for Eugenia had hitherto been conscious of no moral pressure as regards the appreciation of diminutive virgins. It was perhaps an indication of Lizzie's pertness that she very soon retired and left the Baroness on her brother's hands. Acton talked a great deal about his chinoiseries; he knew a good deal about porcelain and bric-a-brac. The Baroness, in her progress through the house, made, as it were, a great many stations. She sat down everywhere, confessed to being a little tired, and asked about the various objects with a curious mixture of alertness and inattention. If there had been any one to say it to she would have declared that she was positively in love with her host; but she could hardly make this declaration--even in the strictest confidence--to Acton himself. It gave her, nevertheless, a pleasure that had some of the charm of unwontedness to feel, with that admirable keenness with which she was capable of feeling things, that he had a disposition without any edges; that even his humorous irony always expanded toward the point. One's impression of his honesty was almost like carrying a bunch of flowers; the perfume was most agreeable, but they were occasionally an inconvenience. One could trust him, at any rate, round all the corners of the world; and, withal, he was not absolutely simple, which would have been excess; he was only relatively simple, which was quite enough for the Baroness.|$|E

40|$|Background: Hypertension is {{the main}} risk factor for most {{cardiovascular}} diseases. A coordinated and organized system from the Brazilian Ministry of Healthy involving Family Health Strategy (FHS), a program {{for the prevention of}} chronic disease, and the Popular Pharmacy Program (PPP), which subsidizes medications for the population, could allow an earlier identification and better blood pressure (BP) control. Matão Controlling Hypertension (MatCH) is a community-based population project that aims to apply an organized, integrated and coordinated program in the city of Matão, Brazil, involving FHS and PPP in order to actively search, treat and follow-up hypertensive subjects. Method: This is a population community-based, interventional, follow-up study where all subjects aged ≥  40 years assisted by the FHS program in Matão will have BP assessed monthly by trained Community Health Agents (CHA) during a <b>domiciliary</b> <b>visit.</b> Identified hypertensive subjects will be referred to FHS physicians for nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatment. Most of the hypertensive drugs used will be available through the PPP. Prevalence of hypertension, awareness, demographics and risk factors will be correlated with BP control. The population study is expected to involve approximately 18. 600 subjects. The study period will be four years. Discussion: Considering that hypertension is asymptomatic in most cases, to reduce the population burden of BP-related deaths and diseases it is essential to detect and treat early all hypertensive patients. If we achieve our large-scale BP control, this program can be applied to other populations from developing countries...|$|E

Consultants claim a fee from the NHS, general practitioners do not. Data from the Department of Health and Social Security on domiciliary consultations in England and Wales during 1981 - 6 were analysed. The number of domiciliary consultations fell during 1981 - 6 from 429, 759 in 1981 to 387, 394 in 1986, a fall of 10 %, whereas the numbers of consultants and general practitioners increased by 1404 (12 %) and 2400 (10 %), respectively. The yearly rate of domiciliary consultation per consultant fell by 19 % from 36 in 1981 to 29 in 1986 and that per general practitioner by 18 % from 18 to 15. In 1986 geriatric medicine had the highest rate of domiciliary consultation per consultant (187) followed by psychiatry (89), general medicine (52), dermatology (49), rheumatology (42), general surgery (36), gastroenterology (35), thoracic medicine (34), and orthopaedics (30).

40|$|In {{the early}} days of the British National Health Service, {{domiciliary}} visits were a continuation of the tradition whereby general practitioners (GPs) met consultants in the patient's home. The nature of domiciliary visits, which still attract a special fee, has since changed. We analysed the effectiveness of all domiciliary visits undertaken in a NHS trust providing primary care, mental health and elderly care services to a population of 470, 000. Data were obtained from <b>domiciliary</b> <b>visit</b> claim forms and from questionnaires completed by the consultant, the referring GP and consultant peer reviewers. The largest number of visits (total 234) was in geriatric medicine 48. 9 %, followed by old-age psychiatry 44. 9 %. Geriatric medicine was more likely than psychiatry to admit patients to hospital (19 %) after a visit. All domiciliary visits in old-age psychiatry were done during the day (9 am to 5 pm). Only 2 % of GPs stated that they attended any of the domiciliary visits; almost all thought that the outcome of domiciliary visits was of value. Old-age-psychiatry peer reviewers believed that all visits in that specialty were appropriate; in geriatric medicine this figure was 77 % and in other psychiatric specialties 65 %. The findings indicate that domiciliary visits were not being used routinely as a pathway to hospital admission, though they were often used to expedite admission or gain a quick consultant opinion; the visits were valued by GPs.
