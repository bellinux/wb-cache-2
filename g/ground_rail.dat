For example, {{it is possible}} to produce a more sinusoidal wave by having split-rail direct current inputs at two voltages, or positive and negative inputs with a central ground. By connecting the inverter output terminals in sequence between the positive rail and ground, the positive rail and the negative rail, the <b>ground</b> <b>rail</b> and the negative rail, then both to the <b>ground</b> <b>rail,</b> a stepped waveform is generated at the inverter output.

Since the patterns of development that automobile infrastructures have produced {{over the last century}} radically differ from the urbanisms that traditional rail systems once served, the integration of new transit systems into this contemporary context has potential for radical innovation. This thesis examines the impact of new modalities within our suburban environments and problematizes the monofunctionality of a ground plane fully dominated by the automobile.

The Deutsche Bahn finally reduced its permitted maximum speed to 80 km/h, which meant it could {{be taken out of}} service because this speed was too low for duties on main lines.

40|$|Rail {{corrugation}} occurring on tracks {{fitted with}} Egg fasteners {{has become a}} serious problem on the newly operated lines of the Beijing metro in recent years. Investigations and field measurements show that the dominant wavelengths of corrugation are 63 – 100 [*]mm, inducing dominant frequencies of vibration on the rail in the frequency range of 160 – 310 [*]Hz for train speeds at 60 – 70 [*]km/h. Due {{to the influence of}} the dynamic behaviour of tracks on the formation of rail corrugation, various options for changing the dynamic behaviour of the track structure can be considered as possible solutions to treat corrugation. Four treatment measures have been considered: rail grinding, adding a rubber pad within the fastener, replacing the fastener with a compression-type fastener, and installing rail dampers on the rail. Field experiments have been carried out {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} these rail corrugation treatment measures on two lines of the Beijing metro. Frequency response functions, track decay rates, and pass-by acceleration on the rail were measured, and the development of rail roughness was monitored. Experimental results show that all the four measures are effective to control or at least slow down the development of rail corrugation on tracks with Egg fastener. Rail grinding is mostly used to limit the effects of corrugation; here, it was noted that low-amplitude corrugation on some straight lines did not reappear after rail grinding. After adding a rubber pad within the fastener, the existing corrugation reduced in amplitude, while corrugation did not reappear on a newly <b>ground</b> <b>rail.</b> Replacing the fastener with a compression-type fastener and installing rail dampers on the rail were found to slow down the development of corrugation...|$|E
40|$|Rail {{grinding}} {{has been}} employed since the 1980 s in maintaining optimal rail profile {{as well as}} in the elimination of surface defects such as corrugations and head-checks. Likewise, the wheel sets also require re- turning to remove surface defects and restore the desired profile. The influence of surface roughness in the wheel/rail contact has been a concern for railway owners since the introduction of rail grinding as a maintenance strategy. Presently, there are no scientifically derived guidelines regarding the surface topographies of ground rails and re-turned wheels. There is thus a need to establish well defined guidelines regarding the surface topographies for new surfaces on the rails and wheels in order to minimize grinding cost/time and improve wheel/rail performance. This thesis concerns the influence of surface roughness of wheel/rail surfaces on running-in behaviour, wear, friction and resultant surface damage. The results presented in this thesis are based on both field measurements and experimental simulations in the laboratory. A two-disc rolling/sliding test machine has been used in the experimental work to simulate the wheel/rail contact. The test specimens were manufactured from actual wheel/rail parts. The maching/finishing parameters were chosen in such a way as to obtain different surface roughness on the test specimens. A Design of Experiment approach (DOE) has been used to conduct experiments and to analyse the results. Results obtained from the field measurements show that the surface roughness of a newly <b>ground</b> <b>rail</b> changes rapidly during the initial stages following grinding. It was also concluded that there is a considerable variation of the surface roughness of re-turned wheels depending on which workshop performed the turning operation. Experimental results show that the surface roughness of the test specimens in certain material pairs do influence wear, friction and resultant surface damage. There is also a significant difference in the tribological behaviour of tests run in dry conditions and those run with water lubrication. Godkänd; 2007; 20070820 (pafi...|$|E
40|$|At {{the present}} time, rocket launch systems, flight {{passenger}}-transport and ground passenger systems have reached their peak of development. In the last 30 years {{there has been}} no increase in speed or reductions in trip costs and space launch. The space launch and air and ground transportation industry needs revolutionary ideas, which allow a jump in speed and delivery capability, and a dramatic drop in space launch and trip price. This idea (kinetic aviation and space launch) was offered and developed in a series of the author researches [1]-[7], but an important facet of this method – the ground electric hypersonic engine- was insufficiently developed. Rail Gun idea was unfit for low acceleration and long rails. All energy is spent into creating a powerful magnetic field produces a strong flash when the apparatus is disconnected from rails. When the rail length is increased, the efficiency of low speed railgun engine approaches zero. The main idea of the offered ground hypersonic electric engine is segmentation of the acceleration track on small special closed-loop sections (12. 5 – 100 m) and a system of special switches which allow return of the magnetic energy to the system transferring it to apparatus movement. This increases the efficiency of hypersonic engine up 0. 9, avoids the burning of rails and using the engine for long periods of time. The same idea may be used in a conventional Rail Gun. Author designed and computed the feasibility and practability of this invention which he designed for the purpose of using it as a space launcher for astronauts and space load, as method for hypersonic long distance aviation and as method for supersonic passenger <b>ground</b> <b>rail</b> transportation. The offered system will be significantly cheaper than the currently used MagLev (Magnetic Levitation) systems, because the vehicle employs conventional wings for levitation and the hypersonic engine is very simple.

40|$|Growth in {{the speed}} and {{integration}} density of CMOS digital systems far outpaces the growth in battery life and physical packaging limits. Voltage reduction promises substantial energy savings, {{by virtue of the}} square law relationship between power and voltage. However, low supply voltage also leads to both higher circuit delays and higher leakage current as transistor thresholds are lowered to maintain performance. ^ Timing and resource utilization imbalances limit opportunities to use a lower supply voltage. Multiple voltage design alleviates this constraint by permitting circuitry that is not in a critical path to run at reduced voltages. In data path designs, one can optimize the schedule of operations and resource utilization to obtain the greatest benefit from multiple voltages. Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and heuristic optimization techniques were used to show that even if a single supply voltage is lowered to the minimum, there are often still opportunities to reduce energy on the order of 20 % to 50 %. ^ Leakage indirectly limits opportunities to use reduce supply voltages. It is not possible to lower the operating voltage indefinitely without lowering the threshold voltage to maintain performance. This can increase leakage by several orders of magnitude. When a circuit is idle, leakage can be alleviated by applying input vectors which minimize the leakage of the circuit. Algorithms and a circuit level leakage model were developed {{in order to be able}} to choose minimum leakage inputs. For most circuits, the minimum leakage input vector alone reduces leakage by less than 50 %. For those gates which are not in a low leakage state and are not in a critical delay path, a leakage control transistor can be inserted between the logic gate and the power or <b>ground</b> <b>rail.</b> Analyzing this last technique, we found leakage levels that were at least 50 % and as much as 90 % lower than the minimum leakage obtained by input vector selection alone. ...|$|E
