One of the {{contemporary}} necessities of <b>interdisciplinarity</b> <b>approach</b> to the knowledge is its philosophical explanation. This paper is an attempt to explain <b>interdisciplinarity</b> <b>approach</b> based on Mull-Sadra’s epistemological point of view. Sadra’s epistemology in its depth is unity-oriented, and hence has a capability for preparing an appropriate foundation for interdisciplinarity mode of knowledge. Here, it, primarily, is provided a brief historical overview on the unity of knowledge ideas led to interdisciplinarity as the recent issue of responding {{to the question of the}} unity of knowledge. Then MullaSadra’s point of view is followed in four axes; origin, necessity, process, and credibility of interdisciplinary knowledge. Based on the four axes, and as the epistemological foundations of interdisciplinarity of Mulla-sadra’s viewpoint, there are developed five foundations; that is, “grounding understanding on the graded unity of being”, “dependency of understanding to the complexity of universe”, “interdependence of components and whole”, “methodic and epistemic plurality and increasingly unity of understanding”, and “hierarchical discovery of truth”. Finally, we have mentioned some fundamental differences between the current interdisciplinary opinions and Sadra’s views. Sadras viewpoint reflects an original unity approach to universe which in itself has a large distance from the urgent technological unity of modern thoughts...|$|E

Indeed, he understood that a viable independent Kenya would require not only a cadre of well-educated native professionals but also inevitably a sustainable robust and dynamic local healthcare and intellectual infrastructures able to fuel and drive a sustainable economic development, hence an equitable holistic wellness of all her peoples. To this effect, he ardently lobbied—albeit unsuccessfully—to adapt health care as an expressly stipulated right endowed under the new constitution of the nascent postcolonial Kenya. This prescient interdisciplinary consummate statesmanship made him distinct from the effusive political cadre of his contemporaries that are prominently chronicled with Kenya’s freedom struggle.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This is {{an attempt}} to define constructivism in a pluralistic way. It categorizes constructivist work within a {{three-dimensional}} space rather than along one dimension only. Practical implications: The interdisciplinary definition makes it possible to perceive the rather heterogenous constructivist community as a coherent and largely consistent scientific effort to provide answers to demanding complex problems. Furthermore it gives authors of Constructivist Foundation the opportunity to locate their own position within the community. Conclusions: I offer a catalogue of ten points that outline the constructivist program. Each of these aspects invites authors to extensively reflect on it and to approach it from their disciplinary background to do work in any of the types of investigations the journal covers.

40|$|Assessing {{the manner}} in which {{research}} is conducted is a key mechanism for leveraging a transformation in sustainability. Scientific answers to current sustainability threats are reliant on research design, conduct and dissemination. Thus, the research process itself merits a full consideration of its responsibility toward societal goals and values. Although the responsibility of research to society has recently been raised in scientific discourse, a systematic framework to guide such considerations that can be applied in a self-reflective manner across disciplines is lacking. Informed by a literature review that revealed an emerging discussion, this paper suggests an assessment framework for socially responsible research processes that integrates eight criteria: (1) approach to complexity and uncertainty, (2) ethics, (3) <b>interdisciplinarity,</b> (4) integrative <b>approach,</b> (5) reflection on impacts, (6) transdisciplinarity, (7) transparency and (8) user orientation.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{attempt to}} {{provide insight into the}} {{interactions}} between the economy and the environment has been an on-going struggle for many decades. The rise of Ecological Economics {{can be seen as a}} positive step towards integrating social and natural science understanding by a movement that aims to go beyond the confines of mainstream economics towards a progressive political economy of the environment. However, this vision has not been shared by all those who have associated themselves with Ecological Economics and there has been conflict. An historical analysis is presented that shows the role of mainstream theory in delimiting the field of environmental research. The argument is put forward that rather than employing a purely mechanistic objective empirical methodology there is a need for an integrating <b>interdisciplinarity</b> heterodox economic <b>approach.</b> In order to distinguish this approach—from the more mainstream mul-tidisciplinary linking of unreconstituted ecological and economic models—the name Social Ecological Economics is put forward as expressing the essential socio-economic character of the needed work ahead...|$|R

40|$|We {{summarise}} {{the main}} {{issues related to}} Community-Based Natural Resource Management which were discussed at an International Workshop organized in Niamey, Niger, in March 2008. The objective of the workshop was to compare and contrast different development-oriented biodiversity conservation and natural resource management approaches as they exist across Africa. These approaches were explored following (1) the fundamentals of natural resource management in relation to local development and livelihoods and (2) the multi-functional nature of land use. The major topics subject to debate were the dichotomy between strictly protected areas and conservation areas including human activities; the importance of legitimate, people-centred conservation, as opposed to legal (drawn from the law) conservation; the key role of market instruments, participatory <b>approaches,</b> <b>interdisciplinarity</b> and local governance; and finally the strong relationships between agriculture and biodiversity conservation, especially at landscape level.

Climate change research has become more interdisciplinary and even transdisciplinary as a typical Mode- 2 science that is also dependent on an application context for its further development. We propose to <b>approach</b> <b>interdisciplinarity</b> as a co-construction of the knowledge base in the reference patterns and the programmatic focus in the editorials in the core journal of the climate-change sciences—Climatic Change—during the period 1977 – 2013. First, we analyze the knowledge base of the journal and map journal–journal relations {{on the basis of the}} references in the articles. Second, we follow the development of the programmatic focus by analyzing the semantics in the editorials. We argue that interdisciplinarity is a result of the co-construction between different agendas: The selection of publications into the knowledge base of the journal, and the adjustment of the programmatic focus to the political context in the editorials. Our results show a widening of the knowledge base from referencing the multidisciplinary journals Nature and Science to citing journals from specialist fields. The programmatic focus follows policy-oriented issues and incorporates public metaphors...|$|R

The necessity ofmanaging flexible knowledge rises on the fore as fundamental issue for future information system oriented to supporting decisions. Might information systems be useful in this interdisciplinary approach ? It is necessary to contain in a knowledge-base both quantitative and qualitative information. Three alternatives are available for a conceptual discussion:the possibility of identify new approaches, in order to develop information systems able in managing new knowledge, the necessity of adding new support systems oriented to manage soft knowledge, to traditionalgeographic information systems (GIS), the possibility of non using support systems coming from a technological vision of problem for nontechnical knowledge (Latouche 1996).

40|$|Th e {{point is}} {{sometimes}} made that, like language, material {{culture is a}} ubiquitous feature of human life. Indeed, material culture may be {{regarded as one of}} the defi ning charac-teristics of being human: it has long been a convention to assert that to be human is to speak, and to make and use tools (Miller and Tilley 1996 : 5; cf. Gibson and Ingold 1993). But whereas the systematic study of language has been codifi ed in the academic discipline of linguistics, or deconstructed in literary and translation studies, it is inter-esting to note that no equivalent discipline has emerged to address the systematic study of human artifacts. Th e study of material culture has, rather, been scattered across a number of disciplines and, as a result, is presented as a somewhat “undisciplined ” fi eld of academic inquiry. In the inaugural editorial of the Journal of Material Culture, something of a mani-festo for contemporary material culture studies, these undisciplined possibilities were embraced by the editors as an advantage. As well as off ering an array of new issues to ex-plore, and methodologies to draw upon, this would encourage “the cross-fertilization of ideas and approaches between people concerned with the material constitution of social relations, ” and ensure a commitment to “a politics of inclusion ” (Miller and Tilley 1996 : 5 – 6). Th us conceived, material culture studies is said to thrive “as a rather undisciplined substitute for a discipline ” (Miller 2010 : 1), unfettered by the conservatism that can blight established disciplines, “with their boundary-maintaining devices, institutional structures, accepted texts, methodologies, internal debates and circumscribed areas of study ” (Miller and Tilley 1996 : 5). Th e <b>interdisciplinarity</b> of <b>approaches</b> to material culture studies seems to be born out in practice: among the contributors to the Journal of Material Culture are to be found geographers and historians, archaeologists and museologists, sociologists and psycholo-gists, art historians and students of design, as well as anthropologists.

40|$|Interdisciplinarity {{has been}} a core tenet of {{critical}} discourse studies, a group of approaches {{to the analysis of}} texts in their social contexts, since its inception, in what may be seen as a reaction against the sometimes staid and rigid disciplinary boundaries of linguistics and other disciplines. Interdisciplinarity has also been seen as necessarily accompanying analyses of complex social problems such as racism, sexism or other forms of discrimination and social domination. The concept has been multiply re-examined, challenged and reaffirmed by critical discourse scholars (for instance, in Weiss & Wodak 2003), and the present article continues this work by mapping out the present-day dimensions of <b>interdisciplinarity</b> in different <b>approaches</b> to critical discourse studies. It also attempts to juxtapose these various disciplinary developments, and consider whether interdisciplinarity in and of itself has come to be taken for granted. Finally, it raises questions about whether the move away from an emphasis on the analysis of social wrongs within some of the newer approaches to critical discourse studies may in time lead to a disciplinary schism, or whether the increasingly disciplinary nature of critical discourse studies itself may have become a problem. This article forms part of an ongoing thematic collection dedicated to the concept of interdisciplinarit...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{cultural}} meanings of beds and chambers in late-medieval England. It {{argues that the}} cultural phenomenon of the chamber, which emerged in England in the later middle ages, had profound and wide-reaching effects on late-medieval society and affected both those who had chambers {{and those who did}} not. This thesis has a strictly interdisciplinary approach, using a range of literary, documentary, visual and archaeological sources, and demonstrates how these sources informed and were informed by cultural associations and assumptions surrounding the bed and chamber. Its analysis of how members of society considered and interacted with the bed and chamber contributes to current discourse on space and objects. Additionally, its in-depth analysis of how cultural meanings of the bed and chamber were articulated and perpetuated sheds new light on late-medieval literature and social practice. This thesis is structured around a set of precepts known as “Arise Early”. Chapter One, “Fyrst Arysse Erly”, reconstructs the physical components of both real and ideal beds and chambers. Chapter Two, “Serve Thy God Deuly”, focuses on the bed and chamber as an appropriate space in which to encounter God and engage in domestic piety. Chapter Three, “Do Thy Warke Wyssely […] And Awnswer the Pepll Curtesly”, analyses how the cultural associations of the bed and chamber with intimacy and sound judgement impacted on personal and political communication and administration. Chapter Four, “Go to Thy Bed Myrely/ And Lye Therin Jocundly”, explores the chamber as a space for communal and individual leisure, the cultural link between beds and books, and the chamber as a space for the appropriate expression of emotion. Chapter Five, “Plesse and Loffe Thy Wyffe Dewly/ And Basse Hyr Onys or Tewys Myrely”, focuses on {{the ways in which the}} bed and chamber were understood in relation to both licit and illicit sex and demonstrates that the marital bed was considered to be the only acceptable locus for sex. Chapter Six, “The Invisible Woman”, explores the powerful link between women and beds and chambers in late-medieval England and demonstrates that chambers both contained and empowered women. Finally, my conclusion demonstrates how these complex cultural meanings were interwoven and highlights the importance of <b>interdisciplinarity</b> in <b>approaching</b> an understanding of the past...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to explore how the discipline of pattern cutting can be taught, investigated and practiced through innovative, interdisciplinary <b>approaches.</b> <b>Interdisciplinarity</b> involves the combining of two or more academic disciplines into one activity (for instance in this enquiry, pattern cutting is merged with disciplines such as health and engineering). The study discusses how interdiscipinarity can break rules, which involve going against a set of regulations that direct a practice or method within an area of activity. This mutinous concept can make pattern cutting appear more exciting and creative to the student and often leads to them exploring different concepts and approaches. The research was based on secondary sources gathered from a review of papers presented at, The Second International Conference for Creative Pattern Cutting, held at University of Huddersfield, 24 and 25 February 2016. This conference was purposively selected due to its discipline relevance and international representation and was unique to the authors because they organised and chaired the event. To date, this has been the sole global platform to disseminate research in pattern cutting and the approach is described as a methodology of conference organisation, using content analysis as well as interviews with the individual authors of selected papers. It focuses on works that considered new ways to pattern cut by effectively implementing interdisciplinary activity into its practice. The findings discuss how the disorderly methods impacted on the student’s experiences. Ultimately this supports the development of original, novel and innovative, pedagogical approaches to pattern cutting practice and has the potential to enrich the fashion industry, encouraging pattern cutters to develop essential skills to cross discipline boundaries...|$|R

40|$|The {{hypothetical}} {{starting point}} of the book was {{the concept of the}} complex socio-cognitive structure of science, with a common (relatively loose) nucleus of the basic characteristics of its social and intellectual system, the interdependence of these two systems, and a high level of cognitive and social peculiarity of individual scientific fields. Our goal was to gain as complete an insight into the socio-cognitive specificities of the natural and social sciences as possible, on the basis of comprehensive empirical research - an insight into the differences and similarities between natural scientists and social scientists in their career paths and patterns, professional performances and achievements, and scientific productivity, as well as in their perceptions of scientific objectivity and quality. To achieve this goal, a more complex quantitative and qualitative methodological approach with several research methods had to be applied. The first ever web survey among Croatian scientists was conducted in 2004, covering 480 or 24. 7 % of natural scientists and social scientists, from whom both quantitative and qualitative data were gathered. In 2007, the first comprehensive bibliometric study of the productivity of all 1, 938 doctors of natural and social sciences was carried out. The data on publications and citations over the period of the last ten years was collected from the WoS (Web of Science) and Scopus bibliographic and citation database for every PhD holder. Basic quantitative (including bibliometric) and qualitative analyses were conducted, in line with the goal and the concept of the book.

40|$|Short {{historical}} {{overview of}} animal welfare sciences: how a societal concern {{has become a}} transdisciplinary subject Animal welfare is a recent scientific topic, the origins {{of which can be}} found in philosophy, physiology (with the introduction of the stress concept), and ethology (with the description of animal behavioural repertoire and needs). In the 1970 ’s, animal welfare became a subject for applied research; the aim was {{to improve the quality of}} animal life. Animal welfare was first studied within specific disciplines, e. g. ethologists compared the behaviour of farm animals to that of their wild counterparts and identified behavioral needs. Stress was then found to be related not only to physiology but also psychology. Stress, behavioural needs, and preferences are closely related to each other. Similarly, the links between animal welfare and health were studied, e. g. a malaise behaviour has been identified and the relationship between stress and immunity was highlighted. More recently, frameworks developed in human psychology were applied to animals in order to identify the emotions they may experience. Such studies require that researchers from one discipline interact with researchers from other disciplines, enabling cross-fertilization of concepts. Researchers in animal welfare quickly understood the value of using various indicators covering a wide range of possible disorders such as abnormal behavior, disease, production defects, emotional states, etc. However, this was not per se an interdisciplinary <b>approach.</b> <b>Interdisciplinarity</b> is well illustrated by the Welfare Quality® project. During this project, a comprehensive assessment tool of animal welfare was developed on the basis of what matters to animals, as identified by researchers in animal science, and what matters to society as identified by social scientists. We believe that the issue of animal welfare needs to break the boundaries between disciplines and beyond disciplines to engage stakeholders and society as a whole. Transdisciplinarity, e. g. going between and beyond disciplines, will be essential to build a holistic approach and be able to effectively improve the welfare of animals...|$|R
