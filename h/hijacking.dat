5|$|Braathen SAFE Flight 139 was an {{aircraft}} <b>hijacking</b> {{that occurred in}} Norway on 21 June 1985. The incident took place on a Boeing 737-205 belonging to Braathens SAFE that was on a scheduled flight from Trondheim Airport, Værnes to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The hijacker was Stein Arvid Huseby, who was drunk {{during most of the}} incident. It was the first plane <b>hijacking</b> to take place in Norway; there were no deaths and no injuries. Huseby was sentenced to three years prison and five years detention.|$|E
5|$|During {{the court}} case, Huseby {{stated that he}} wanted help from society and {{attention}} drawn to his cause. However, he stated that he regretted doing this by <b>hijacking.</b> He stated that {{all he wanted was}} {{to send a message to}} the minister of justice and prime minister that he needed help, and that he did not intend that the other passengers be aware of his threats. Huseby stated that the <b>hijacking</b> was spontaneous and that he planned to make an armed robbery or take hostages at the Radisson SAS hotel in Oslo. His defence lawyer argued that Huseby did not commit a <b>hijacking</b> in the letter of the law, but had instead taken hostages, which would result in a lesser sentence. The court psychologists stated that Huseby had a difficult childhood, and had been defined as an alcoholic at the age of 17. They considered him to have very underdeveloped ability to make rational decisions and weak mental health. They also stated that he committed crimes to identify himself due to his low self-esteem. On 29 May 1986, Huseby was found guilty of <b>hijacking</b> in Eidsivating Court of Appeal. He was sentenced to three years prison and five years of preventive supervision.|$|E

Lewin was seated in 9B, and Suqami was directly behind him in 10B.
