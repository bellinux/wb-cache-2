A poll of United States and Chinese university students in 2000 provides <b>factor</b> <b>analysis</b> of responses to questions about, , the participants' belief that extraterrestrial life exists in the Universe, that such life may be intelligent, and that humans will eventually make contact with it. The study shows significant weighted correlations between participants' belief that extraterrestrial contact may either conflict with or enrich their personal religious beliefs and how conservative such religious beliefs are. The more conservative the respondents, the more harmful they considered extraterrestrial contact to be. Other significant correlation patterns indicate that participants took the view that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence may be futile or even harmful.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, Zimbardo {{began working}} with Sarah Brunskill and Anthony Ferreras on a new theory called the social {{intensity}} syndrome (SIS). SIS is a new term coined to describe and normalize the effects military culture has on the socialization of both active soldiers and veterans. Zimbardo and Brunskill presented the new theory and a preliminary <b>factor</b> <b>analysis</b> of it accompanying survey at the Western Psychological Association in 2013. Brunskill finished the data collection in December 2013. Through an exploratory component <b>factor</b> <b>analysis,</b> confirmatory <b>factor</b> <b>analysis,</b> internal consistency and validity tests demonstrated that SIS was a reliable and valid construct of measuring military socialization. Fifty-eight items were deemed viable and six factors were identified; military friends (16 items), family (11 items), gender social preference (7 items), social bonding (11 items), nostalgia (9 items) and drug use (4 items). Identifying and standardizing SIS was the first step, further research has identified that 4 demographic categories within the military; active and have been deployed (AD), active and never been deployed (AND), inactive and have been deployed (ID) and inactive and never been deployed (IND). These are important categories to better understand how service members are affected leaving the military.|$|E
25|$|Prayer {{is fairly}} {{prevalent}} in the United States. About 75% of the United States reports praying {{at least once a}} week. However, the practice of prayer is more prevalent and practiced more consistently among Americans who perform other religious practices. There are four primary types of prayer in the West. Poloma and Pendleton, utilized <b>factor</b> <b>analysis</b> to delineate these four types of prayer: meditative (more spiritual, silent thinking), ritualistic (reciting), petitionary (making requests to God), and colloquial (general conversing with God). Further scientific study of prayer using <b>factor</b> <b>analysis</b> has revealed three dimensions of prayer. Ladd and Spilka’s first factor was awareness of self, inward reaching. Their second and third factors were upward reaching (toward God) and outward reaching (toward others). This study appears to support the contemporary model of prayer as connection (whether to the self, higher being, or others).|$|E

25|$|Rather, {{according}} to {{professor of psychology}} Bernardo J.

Research using the statistical techniques of <b>factor</b> <b>analysis</b> and correlation have found shyness overlaps mildly with both introversion and neuroticism (i.e., negative emotionality). Low societal acceptance of shyness or introversion may reinforce a shy or introverted individual's low self-confidence.|$|E
25|$|Both the EPQ and Big Five {{approaches}} extensively use self-report questionnaires. The {{factors are}} intended to be orthogonal (uncorrelated), though there are often small positive correlations between factors.

Hans Eysenck has argued that fewer factors are superior to a larger number of partly related ones. Although these two approaches are comparable because of the use of <b>factor</b> <b>analysis</b> to construct hierarchical taxonomies, they differ in the organization and number of factors.|$|E

25|$|Eysenck made early {{contributions}} to {{fields such as}} personality by express and explicit commitment to a very rigorous adherence to scientific methodology, as Eysenck believed that scientific methodology was required for progress in personality psychology. He used, for example, <b>factor</b> <b>analysis,</b> a statistical method, to support his personality model. An example is Inheritance of Neuroticism: An Experimental Study, quoted above.

25|$|Psychometricians {{have also}} {{developed}} methods {{for working with}} large matrices of correlations and covariances.

All these multivariate descriptive methods try to distill large amounts of data into simpler structures. More recently, structural equation modeling and path analysis represent more sophisticated approaches to working with large covariance matrices. These methods allow statistically sophisticated models to be fitted to data and tested to determine if they are adequate fits.|$|E
