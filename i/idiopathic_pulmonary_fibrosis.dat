40|$|<b>Idiopathic</b> <b>pulmonary</b> hilar <b>fibrosis</b> is a {{condition}} related to mediastinal fibrosis, characterized by localization of the fibrosing process to one or both pulmonary hila. This results in pulmonary hypertension and bronchial narrowing. Three patients suffering from this disease, in whom the diagnosis has been confirmed by thoracotomy, are reported. The clinical and pathological features are described and previously reported cases are reviewed. The syndrome is classified into two types, according to whether the obstruction affects mainly the pulmonary artery or veins. The disease is a self-limiting one but may lead to organic changes in the lungs causing severe disability.

25|$|Some {{researchers}} {{have proposed that}} recurrent ear infections, and <b>idiopathic</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> might be tied, in some cases, to GERD; however, a causative role has not been established. GERD {{does not appear to}} be linked to chronic sinusitis.|$|E
25|$|Asbestosis resembles {{many other}} diffuse {{interstitial}} lung diseases, including other pneumoconiosis.

The presence of pleural plaquing may provide supportive evidence of causation by asbestos. Although lung biopsy {{is usually not}} necessary, the presence of asbestos bodies in association with pulmonary fibrosis establishes the diagnosis. Conversely, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis {{in the absence of}} asbestos bodies is most likely not asbestosis. Asbestos bodies in the absence of fibrosis indicate exposure, not disease.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{report the}} case and discuss {{the outcome of a}} 63 -year-old man, who was transplanted for {{hepatocellular}} carcinoma arising from cirrhosis associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver and diabetes. Because of co-existent well-compensated <b>idiopathic</b> familial <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> and family history of cryptogenic cirrhosis, he was screened and found positive for a novel c. 2062 C>G telomerase (TERT) mutation, encoding for the protein Glu 668 Asp variant, which was also confirmed in the neoplastic tissue. TERT mutations have very recently been associated with a spectrum of familial hepatic liver diseases often characterized by steatosis and hepatic iron overload, and have been reported to represent a frequent risk factor for cirrhosis, being observed in as much as 3 – 8 % of unselected patients with different liver diseases. Due to the systemic involvement of telomerase diseases very likely influencing the clinical outcome, and the peculiar biological features of hepatocellular carcinoma arising in this context, we suggest that patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis or other suggestive features should be screened for TERT mutations and specific treatment algorithms elaborated for this disease...|$|R
40|$|Studies using genetically {{modified}} mice have revealed fundamental {{functions of the}} transcription factor Fos/AP- 1 in bone biology, inflammation, and cancer. However, the biological role of the Fos-related protein Fra- 2 is not well defined in vivo. Here we report an unexpected profibrogenic function of Fra- 2 in transgenic mice, in which ectopic expression of Fra- 2 in various organs resulted in generalized fibrosis with predominant manifestation in the lung. The pulmonary phenotype was characterized by vascular remodeling and obliteration of pulmonary arteries, which coincided with expression of osteopontin, an AP- 1 target gene involved in vascular remodeling and fibrogenesis. These alterations were followed by inflammation; release of profibrogenic factors, such as IL- 4, insulin-like growth factor 1, and CXCL 5; progressive fibrosis; and premature mortality. Genetic experiments and bone marrow reconstitutions suggested that fibrosis developed independently of B and T cells and was not mediated by autoimmunity despite the marked inflammation observed in transgenic lungs. Importantly, strong expression of Fra- 2 was also observed in human samples of <b>idiopathic</b> and autoimmune-mediated <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis.</b> These findings indicate that Fra- 2 expression is sufficient to cause <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> in mice, possibly by linking vascular remodeling and fibrogenesis, and suggest that Fra- 2 has {{to be considered a}} contributing pathogenic factor of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> in humans...|$|R
40|$|Idiopathic {{interstitial}} pneumonias (IIPs) are {{a collection}} of pulmonary fibrotic diseases of unknown etiopathogenesis. CC chemokine receptor 7 (CCR 7) is expressed in IIP biopsies and primary fibroblast lines, but its role in <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> was not previously examined. To study the in vivo role of CCR 7 in a novel model of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis,</b> 1. 0 × 106 primary fibroblasts grown from <b>idiopathic</b> <b>pulmonary</b> fibrosis/usual interstitial pneumonia, nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, or histologically normal biopsies were injected intravenously into C. B- 17 severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) /beige (bg) mice. At days 35 and 63 after <b>idiopathic</b> <b>pulmonary</b> fibrosis/usual interstitial pneumonia fibroblast injection, patchy interstitial fibrosis and increased hydroxyproline {{were present in the}} lungs of immunodeficient mice. Adoptively transferred nonspecific interstitial pneumonia fibroblasts caused a more diffuse interstitial fibrosis and increased hydroxyproline levels at both times, but injected normal human fibroblasts did not induce interstitial remodeling changes in C. B- 17 SCID/bg mice. Systemic therapeutic immunoneutralization of either human CCR 7 or CC ligand 21, its ligand, significantly attenuated the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> in groups of C. B- 17 SCID/bg mice that received either type of IIP fibroblasts. Thus, the present study demonstrates that <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> is initiated by the intravenous introduction of primary human fibroblast lines into immunodeficient mice, and this fibrotic response is dependent on the interaction between CC ligand 21 and CCR 7...|$|R

40|$|Fibroblast foci (FF) are {{considered}} a relevant morphologic marker of <b>idiopathic</b> <b>pulmonary</b> fibrosis/usual interstitial pneumonia (IPF/UIP), and are recognised as sites where fibrotic responses are initiated and/or perpetuated in this severe disease.

In previous studies we have provided evidence of abnormal activation of the wnt-signaling-pathway in IPF/UIP that is centred on FF and the overlying epithelium.

30|$|Pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (PPFE) {{is a rare}} {{idiopathic}} interstitial pneumonia (IIP) {{first described}} as <b>idiopathic</b> <b>pulmonary</b> upper lobe <b>fibrosis</b> in 1992 in the Japanese literature by Aminati et al. [1] and with approximately 70 patients described in the English-language literature until now [1 – 11]. This entity is characterised by fibrotic and elastotic thickening of the pleura and subpleural lung parenchyma, mainly in the upper lobes [4]. Although the aetiology of PPFE is considered idiopathic in most cases, an association {{with a wide range}} of factors has been reported such as genetic predisposition; recurrent lower respiratory tract infections; underlying diseases or conditions such as collagen vascular diseases, bone-marrow transplantation or lung transplant patients suffering from restrictive allograft syndrome [5 – 8]. The therapeutic approach is highly variable in the published clinical cases with no clearly definitive therapeutic options other than lung transplantation [9]. Disease progression occurs in 60  % of patients with death from disease in 40  % [10]. The largest series of patients reported showed that of ten patients, five died during the first 2  years of evolution [1 – 11]. Nevertheless, no specific data related with survival is defined, but an overall bad prognosis can be assumed based on available data.|$|R

40|$|The {{therapeutic}} effect of steroid hormone(STH) against <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> was evaluated in 6 patients with dermatomyositis(DM), 6 with progressive systemic sclerosis(PSS), 3 with rheumatoid arthritis(RA) and 5 with <b>idiopathic</b> <b>pulmonary</b> fibrosis(IPF). Of these patients, 7 were male and 13 were female. The average age was 46. 5, ranging from 24 to 66 years old. Dosage of STH varied between 10 mg and 40 mg/day in each {{patient and the}} mean administration period was 14 months. Clinical effects were determined using chest X-ray film, % VC, PaO(2) and direct questioning. Twelve out of 20 patients improved after STH therapy. The clinical effectiveness of STH depended on the ground disease of patients with pulmonary fibrosis; that is, STH was most effective against <b>pulmonary</b> <b>fibrosis</b> in patients with DM and less effective in patients with PSS. STH was also effective in patients with acute stage IPF, but not in patients with chronic IPF. STH seemed to be dose dependent, being more effective in patients with the high dosage of STH.
