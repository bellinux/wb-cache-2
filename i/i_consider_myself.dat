All of us, that is, I myself and Borodin, and Balakirev, and {{especially}} Cui and Mussorgsky, did disdain these things. <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> lucky that I bethought myself in time and forced myself to work. As for Balakirev, owing to his insufficient technique he writes little; Borodin, with difficulty; Cui, carelessly; and Mussorgsky, sloppily and often incoherently.|$|E

Youngblood concluded, [...] "I wasn’t the biggest guy, I certainly wasn’t the strongest and I wasn’t the fastest either. [...] But I think one of my biggest assets was that I had an undeniable determination to be the best that has ever {{put his hand on the}} ground, I had a genuine desire to be great." ...|$|E

And, for a guy who died in the pilot, <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> pretty fortunate." [...] Actors who guest star in the episode include Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Joseph Meegar, Max Baker as Jacob Fischer, and Marylouise Burke as Flora Meegar.

500|$|In early 2010, {{a primary}} {{challenge}} from {{radio talk show}} host and former U.S. Congressman J. D. Hayworth materialized in the 2010 U.S. Senate election in Arizona and drew support from some but not all elements of the Tea Party movement. With Hayworth using the campaign slogan [...] "The Consistent Conservative", McCain said – despite his own past use of the term {{on a number of occasions}} – [...] "I never considered myself a maverick. <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> a person who serves the people of Arizona to the best of his abilities." [...] The primary challenge coincided with McCain reversing or muting his stance on some issues such as the bank bailouts, closing of the Guantánamo Bay detention camp, campaign finance restrictions, and gays in the military.|$|E
500|$|Stoddart himself outspoken about Modernism, and its {{contemporary}} {{failures and}} historical misunderstandings, without hesitation, {{makes clear that}} his work stems from a Modernism born in neo-classicism, [...] "And yet, after having said all this about Modernism, <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> a Modernist – but {{in the context of}} a vast application of the term extending miles beyond the pokey wee official area to which usually it is confined. For in truth there are really two kinds of Modernism to be uncovered in the space of the last two and a half centuries, and it is to the first and largest of these that I belong and to which, in my small way, I contribute. This is the Modernism that was born in neo-classicism and has, as its great central titan, the mighty Richard Wagner." ...|$|E

A staff member at CD Journal was positive, complimenting the songwriting {{on how it}} holds a [...] "sharp message" [...] for listeners to understand. The review concluded with the reviewer labeling it [...] "exhilarating". In a similar review, The News Hub's Can Hoang Tran said that [...] "There are times {{that you may have}} rewound the anime to the very beginning just to listen to the theme song. <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> part of that group of anime let alone Gate fans." [...] He called it one of 2015's [...] "catchy and [...] " [...] anime theme songs.

500|$|Homer's chants and his {{nickname}} [...] "Dancin' Homer" [...] is {{a reference to}} American baseball fan Wild Bill Hagy, who earned the nickname [...] "The Roar from Thirty-Four" [...] for his chants during the 1970s in section thirty-four at Baltimore's Memorial Stadium. Homer spells out Springfield just like Hagy spelled O-R-I-O-L-E-S with his arms. A drunk Homer performs his first dance to the 1961 tune [...] "Baby Elephant Walk" [...] written by Henry Mancini. Bleeding Gums Murphy makes a 26-minute-long performance of the [...] "Star-Spangled Banner" [...] at the game where Homer performs his first dance. Homer's line, [...] "Today, as I leave for Capital City, <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> the luckiest mascot {{on the face of}} the earth" [...] that he says in his farewell speech to the Springfield fans, is a reference to Lou Gehrig's farewell speech in the 1942 baseball film The Pride of the Yankees. The song [...] "Capital City" [...] that Bennett sings over the closing credits is a parody of the 1980 song [...] "New York, New York".|$|E
500|$|On February 6, 1960, Cooper {{was awarded}} a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6243 Hollywood Boulevard for his {{contribution}} to the film industry. He was also awarded a star on the sidewalk outside the Ellen Theater in Bozeman, Montana. On May 6, 1961, {{he was awarded the}} French Order of Arts and Letters in recognition of his significant contribution to the arts. On July 30, 1961, he was posthumously awarded the David di Donatello Special Award in Italy for his career achievements. In 1966, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Western Performers at the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City. The American Film Institute (AFI) ranked Cooper eleventh on its list of the 25 male stars of classic Hollywood. Three of his characters—Will Kane, Lou Gehrig, and Sergeant York—made AFI's list of the one hundred greatest heroes and villains, all of them as heroes. His Lou Gehrig line, [...] "Today, <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> the luckiest man {{on the face of the}} earth.", is ranked by AFI as the thirty-eighth greatest movie quote of all time. More than a half century after his death, Cooper's enduring legacy, according to biographer Jeffrey Meyers, is his image of the ideal American hero preserved in his film performances. Charlton Heston once observed, [...] "He projected the kind of man Americans would like to be, probably more than any actor that's ever lived." ...|$|E

Challenged in 1974 over his serious demeanor in concerts {{and the military}} salutes he ended them with, Cohen remarked, [...] "I sing serious songs, and I'm serious onstage because I couldn't do it any other way...I don't consider myself a civilian. <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> a soldier, and that's the way soldiers salute." ...|$|E

2500|$|Earhart {{was engaged}} to Samuel Chapman, a {{chemical}} engineer from Boston; she broke off the engagement on November 23, 1928. During the same period, Earhart and publisher George P. Putnam had {{spent a great deal}} of time together. Putnam, who was known as GP, was divorced in 1929 and sought out Earhart, proposing to her six times before she finally agreed to marry him. After substantial hesitation on her part, they married on February 7, 1931, in Putnam's mother's house in Noank, Connecticut. Earhart referred to her marriage as a [...] "partnership" [...] with [...] "dual control". In a letter written to Putnam and hand delivered to him on the day of the wedding, she wrote, [...] "I want you to understand I shall not hold you to any midaevil [...] code of faithfulness to me nor shall <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> bound to you similarly." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked his}} views on the growing Civil Rights Movement after having to make an {{emergency}} landing in North Vietnam, he answered, [...] "Look, friend, I'm really not interested in all of that, really. See <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> damned lucky {{to have been able}} to land my airplane at this emergency strip in one piece." [...] Being asked about militants like H. Rap Brown and Stokely Carmichael, who implied that blacks ought to fight at home rather than in Vietnam, also angered James, with him stating [...] "...the lawlessness, rioting, men like Stokely Carmichael acting as if they speak for the Negro people. They aren't, and set civil rights back 100 years!" [...] James even removed his Black Panther emblem from his helmet since it had become associated with a movement he no longer identified with. Excerpts from some of the speeches have been read into the Congressional Record.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1988 presidential election, George H.W. Bush (Yale '48) derided Michael Dukakis {{for having}} [...] "foreign-policy views born in Harvard Yard's boutique". When {{challenged}} on {{the distinction between}} Dukakis' Harvard connection and his own Yale background, he said that, unlike Harvard, Yale's reputation was [...] "so diffuse, there isn't a symbol, I don't think, in the Yale situation, any symbolism in it" [...] and said Yale did not share Harvard's reputation for [...] "liberalism and elitism". In 2004 Howard Dean stated, [...] "In some ways, <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> separate from the other three (Yale) candidates of 2004. Yale changed so much between the class of '68 and the class of '71. My class was the first class to have women in it; {{it was the first}} class to have a significant effort to recruit African Americans. It was an extraordinary time, and in that span of time is the change of an entire generation".|$|E

2500|$|Milano {{began her}} career at age seven, when her babysitter, without notifying her parents, {{took her to}} an {{audition}} {{for one of the}} four principal parts in a national touring company of Annie. Milano was one of four selected from more than 1,500 girls. During the course of her work in the play, Milano and her mother were on the road for 18 months. After returning to New York, she appeared in television commercials and did several roles in off-Broadway productions, including the first American musical adaptation of Jane Eyre. When accompanying a friend from the Annie production to the office of a New York agent, Milano was introduced to the agent, who began representing her. She does not feel that growing {{up in front of the}} camera harmed her childhood, and has said: [...] "I love my family very much [...] they've really backed my career. <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> to be normal: I've got to clean my room, and help in the kitchen." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eliot's {{childhood}} {{infatuation with}} literature can be ascribed to several factors. Firstly, {{he had to}} overcome physical limitations as a child. Struggling from a congenital double inguinal hernia, he could not participate in many physical activities and thus was prevented from socializing with his peers. As he was often isolated, his love for literature developed. Once he learned to read, the young boy immediately became obsessed with books and was absorbed in tales depicting savages, the Wild West, or Mark Twain's thrill-seeking Tom Sawyer. In his memoir of Eliot, his friend Robert Sencourt comments that the young Eliot [...] "would often curl up in the window-seat behind an enormous book, setting the drug of dreams against the pain of living." [...] Secondly, Eliot credited his hometown with fuelling his literary vision: [...] "It is self-evident that St. Louis affected me more deeply than any other environment has ever done. I {{feel that there is}} something in having passed one's childhood beside the big river, which is incommunicable to those people who have not. <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> fortunate to have been born here, rather than in Boston, or New York, or London." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, in a {{town hall}} meeting in Pennsylvania debating the Jewish Tradition with Martin Amis, Hitchens commented on his {{political}} philosophy by stating, [...] "I am no longer a socialist, but I still am a Marxist". In a June 2010 interview with The New York Times, he stated that [...] "I still think like a Marxist in many ways. I think the materialist conception of history is valid. <b>I</b> <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> a very conservative Marxist". In 2009, in an article for The Atlantic entitled [...] "The Revenge of Karl Marx", Hitchens frames the late-2000s recession in terms of Marx's economic analysis and notes how much Marx admired the capitalist system that he called for the end of, but says that Marx ultimately failed to grasp how revolutionary capitalist innovation was. Hitchens was an admirer of Che Guevara, yet in an essay written in 1997, he distanced himself from Che, and referred to the mythos surrounding him as a [...] "cult". In 2004 he re-emphasized his positive view of Che, commenting that [...] " [...] death {{meant a lot to me}} and countless like me at the time. He was a role model, albeit an impossible one for us bourgeois romantics insofar as he went and did what revolutionaries were meant to do—fought and died for his beliefs." ...|$|E

5000|$|In a 2007 {{interview}} with Bill O'Reilly Miller {{spoke on the}} subject of his political outlook [...] "Well, listen. I must say that <b>I</b> never <b>considered</b> <b>myself</b> a secular progressive. ...<b>I</b> didn't <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> that then, and <b>I</b> don't <b>consider</b> <b>myself</b> to be Curtis LeMay now. I have always thought of myself as a pragmatist. And I began to see a degree of certitude on the left that I found unsettling. I don't like lockstep, even if it's lockstep about being open-minded. And after 9/11, I remember thinking we might have to get into some preemptive measures here. And that seemed to put me — I don't know — off to the kids' table." [...] He said that his more open conservatism may have cost him some passing acquaintances, but it has not affected [...] "my dear friends. I certainly hope our friendship runs deeper than that. I still have some ultra-liberal friends." ...|$|R
