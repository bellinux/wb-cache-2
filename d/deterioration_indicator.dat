In order to realize the secondary use of in-car Li+B batteries, it is required {{to understand how the}} deterioration of battery can be analyzed through a set of running data. The deterioration of batteries will occur from time to time, thus, it is necessary to measure by multiple points for accurate speculation. The data sets of EV running data are large in volume and high in complexity, and visual data mining (VDM) application is implemented for analysis. The application enables stereovision three-dimensional data representation on a set of super high-definition 4 K Displays. Data sets are visualized as holistic view, and selected with selected data range and calculate the statistical value at selected data range. Using the VDM application, stable windows of internal resistance were found. There found more than dozens of data points identified at running state after full charge. Plots of those data points in chronological sequence showed the deterioration progress. The data filtering logic for finding internal resistance proved that it can be accounted as <b>deterioration</b> <b>indicator</b> and be applied to deterioration speculation...|$|E

The purpose of this thesis is to investigate {{the effect of the}} environmental conditions on the deterioration of concrete building facades, develop a system for monitoring these conditions, and predict the deterioration and remaining service life of these facades {{on the basis of the}} monitoring data. The thesis consists of a literature review, laboratory and field investigation, the development of a hygrothermal monitoring and deterioration predicting system, and its application to concrete building facades. The literature review covered the concrete deterioration caused by moisture and changes in temperature. Special attention was given to the corrosion of steel reinforcement as a result of carbonation, damage caused by repeated freezing and thawing, and mould growth. The laboratory investigation and field monitoring of relative humidity and temperature were carried out to assess the impact of environmental factors on the performance of the structure under concern. The laboratory and field measurement data were used to validate the concrete deterioration prediction models. The results confirm that the hygrothermal field monitoring is significant for: (i) collecting real relative humidity and temperature data within the concrete facades and the surrounding environmental conditions; (ii) integrating the effects of the measured data into different indicators for calculating the potential for deterioration, and (iii) working as an early warning alarm to ensure appropriate renovation and maintenance measures by comparing the predicted deterioration levels with different threshold values of <b>deterioration</b> <b>indicators.</b> Based on the monitoring data, the environmental factors that affect the deterioration of concrete building facades are characterized. The result of the research will improve the building construction industry by providing methodologies and systems for monitoring and predicting the performance of structures. A scientific relevance of this research will be the improved understanding between the results received in laboratory studies and observations of deterioration in practice. The implementation of the RHT-MAPS monitoring system developed can be carried out cost-effectively in comparison to the construction and maintenance expenses of concrete facades.

The analysis of the inflation process in Georgia, on the basis of which its positive and negative sides are defined, as well as the causes and consequences of the process is carried out. On the basis of the functional approach the stochastic autoregression model of the second order is constructed. This model has simple structure and high degree of adequacy of experimental data. By the method of parameters variation the differential equation is solved. On the basis of the solution of the differential equation which is used for short-term inflation process forecasting, the forecasting function is received. The resulting model will be used for the optimal control of inflation process. ???????? ????????? ??????????? ??????? ??????????? ? ???????? ??????? ??????????? ??????????, ??????? ???????? ? ????????? ??????????? ?? ?????- ? ???????????. ??? ????????? ???????? ?????????? ? ??????????????? ??????????????????? ?????????? ?????????? ????????? ??????????? ?????? ????????????? ? ??????????. ? ?????? ??? ??????? ?????? ????????????? ? ??????????????? ?????? ??????? ????????, ??????? ???????? ????? ?? ???????? ????????? ??? ?????? ????? ????. ???????? ?????? ???????? ???????? ? ??????, ?? ?????? ???????? ?????????? ??? ????????????? ? ????????????? ???????, ? ????? ??????? ? ??????????? ???????????? ?????????? ????????. ?? ?????? ??????????????? ??????? ????????? ?????????????? ????????????????? ?????? ??????? ???????, ??????? ?????????? ????????? ????????? ? ??????? ???????? ???????????? ????????????????? ??????. ?????????? ????????? ?????? ??????? ???????? ??????????. ???????? ??????? ??????????????? ?? ?????? ??????? ??????????? ?????????, ??????? ???????????? ??? ?????????????? ??????????????? ???????? ????????. ?????????? ?????? ????? ???????????? ??? ???????????? ?????????? ????????? ????????...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays in Russian cities a {{significant}} part of the housing stock in areas of existing buildings has a high level of physical and moral <b>deterioration,</b> <b>indicators</b> of infrastructure elements do not meet the current and future requirements. Reconstruction of residential buildings is one of the important directions in solving the housing problem. This will allow us to not only extend the life cycle but also significantly improve the quality of housing, eliminate a communal settlement, provide the houses with modern engineering equipment, improve architectural expressiveness of buildings and increase their energy efficiency. For buildings of different construction periods an individual approach is required in the development of methods and technologies of reconstruction. At the same time, the process should take place not in a separate building but in a group of buildings, neighborhood or district. This makes it possible to undertake a comprehensive assessment of the urban development situation and make the most rational decisions to meet modern conditions, and provide logical connection between various architectural trends. At the same time, there are possibilities for compaction and decompaction of buildings, the rational use of inter-district, underground space and communication systems. Moscow region is a large region, which occupies an area of 46 thousand square kilometers. The region includes more than 38 municipalities (municipal districts, urban and rural settlements). The region’s population is more than 7 million people. Moscow oblast has a central location in the Russian Federation and a close relationship with the capital. This relationship with Moscow is manifested through common social, scientific, industrial, transport links, environmental protection problems, labor resources. In 2016 the total area of the housing stock in Moscow region was about 220 million sq. m. The total area of dilapidated and emergency housing stock is just over 2. 5 million sq. m. In addition, {{a significant}} part of the housing stock needs major repair and reconstruction.

40|$|In {{the spring}} 2001, {{the world economy}} is in a {{delicate}} situation. The vigorous growth momentum that prevailed in the recovery in 1999 and into 2000 is clearly gone. In {{the second half of}} 2000, global growth decelerated rapidly. In contrast to the last downturn of the world economy in 1997 / 98, the deceleration originated in the industrial countries, where growth rates were more or less cut in half compared to {{the first half of the}} year and the OECD leading indicator declined rapidly (Figure 1. 1). Major factors behind the slowdown were lagged effects of monetary tightening and the pronounced and sustained rise in oil prices. It has to be noted, however, that the loss of momentum was substantially larger than expected by most forecasters, including the AIECE institutes in fall of last year, although oil prices behaved largely as expected. The deceleration of activity was particularly pronounced in the IT sector, and the substantial weakening of demand for electronics equipment and IT consumer goods went in tandem with a dramatic decline in the price of tech stocks on a global scale.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this review is to find ecologically and economically reasonable method of biomass processing to produce electricity and thermal energy. The major causes of the annual increase in the volume of consumed electricity and thermal energy are the current pace of scientific and technological progress, the overcrowding of cities and industrial agglomeration. Traditional energy sources (coal, oil, gas) have a significant {{negative impact on the}} environment, which leads to the <b>deterioration</b> of sanitary-hygienic <b>indicators</b> of the human environment. Besides, prices for traditional energy resources are increasing due to the decline of easy produced stocks. The goal of this article is the investigation and evaluation of environmental and economic efficiency of biomass fast pyrolysis methods for as modern energy resources. The result of the review is the choice of biomass fast pyrolysis as the most environmentally reasonable and economically viable local method of producing electricity and thermal energy in Russia. This method is more eco-friendly, compared to other alternative energy sources, for example using peat as solid fuel...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Cognitive {{functions}} in schizophrenia {{have been reported}} to be reliable predictors and correlates of psychosocial skill and community outcome. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the relationship with frontal {{functions in}} patients with schizophrenia to alexithymia dimensions, which is before the onset of clinical signs of <b>deterioration</b> as an <b>indicator.</b> Material and Methods: This study was conducted with patients who were treated as outpatients in Erenkoy Mental and Nervous Diseases Training and Research Hospital Psychotic Disorders and Schizophrenia Outpatient Clinic. The data collection form, Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) and the 20 -item Toronto Alexithymia Scale were administered to 152 patients with schizophrenia who accepted to participate in this study. Results: Of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia alexithymia total score and subscale scores, frontal function and in their relations with sub-scale, was observed level of significance of all relationships. This relationship, after taking control of demographic and clinical variables was observed in the proceeding. Conclusion: It is observed that the alexithymia has effects on the frontal functions of patients with schizophrenia. This mediated effect is related with the clinic of schizophrenia.

40|$|The {{waste of}} the {{production}} of steel are ordinarily used in asphalt concrete pavements. The by-product named slag, whose chemical properties are similar to effusive rocks, is transformed into course aggregates. It is used for bituminous surfacing as a valuable replacement to natural aggregates, which are becoming increasingly rare. Moreover, the wearing coarse made with this material maintain good values of micro-texture, even after {{the action of the}} traffic loads for a long time. This technique is used on the road network of Friuli Venezia Giulia since many years. The study has the main purpose to identify a decay curve (<b>deterioration)</b> of the <b>indicators</b> of friction with the number of passing accumulated of vehicles over the years. The indicator monitored is the micro-texture indirectly assessed by measures of BPN. The sections of the measures have been carefully chosen, so as to be homogeneous for the geometric characteristics of the axis, for organization of the cross section and type of the wearing course. The measures BPN regarding more points in the same section. In particular on the wheel paths and the shoulders not affected by the traffic. The measures in situ were related to the number of passing vehicles, and compared with the values of Polished Stone Value test...|$|R
40|$|Currently, special {{attention}} is paid to the aircraft fuel quality as a component of safety to ensure trouble-free operation of the fuel system. The existing system of quality control involves periodic sampling of the fuel in the container and their subsequent control by the normalized quality indicators that do not identify possible reasons for the <b>deterioration</b> of these <b>indicators</b> to remove them for trouble-free operation and do not identify the factors of pollution sources. The monitoring system generally ensures the implementation of measures to preserve the quality of aviation fuel and flight safety of serviced civil aviation airlines at current level according to regulatory requirements. The article describes the mathematical model for calculation parameters of indicator filtering partitions based on cascade filtration theoretical studies of mechanical impurities. Pores of indicator filtering partitions calculated by means of mathematical model have been experimentally tested on simulator stand and showed a good convergence of calculated and experimental results. The use of cascade filtration of fuel with different indicator partitions parameters made it possible to develop a device for fuel purity monitoring, allowing continuous (inline) monitoring the level of liquid flow contamination at various points of technological equipment (for example, after the pump, at the inlet and outlet of tanks and units, the output of the filter, etc.) and to carry out functional diagnostics of units condition process equipment by monitoring changes of particle parameters and the wear occurrence...|$|R
