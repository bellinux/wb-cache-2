A combination of synthesis and innovation, sustainable design does not consider innovation to be an interruption (feedback loop) to the design process as in traditional [...] "concept to completion" [...] design. Rather, innovations {{are to be expected}} and integrated. Differing from the traditional step-wise process, synthovation is a spiral, dynamic, and continuously moving process toward completion of the design and throughout the life of the project, including end-of life recycling and <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>disassembly,</b> a component of design for environment (DfE), with innovations added along the way that will increase the sustainability of the project over its entire life cycle.|$|E
5000|$|Every {{engineering}} {{discipline is}} engaged in sustainable design, employing numerous initiatives, especially life cycle analysis (LCA), pollution prevention, design for the environment (DfE), <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>disassembly</b> (DfD), and design for recycling (DfR). These are replacing or at least changing pollution control paradigms. For example, concept of a [...] "cap and trade" [...] has been tested and works well for some pollutants. This is a system where companies are allowed to place a [...] "bubble" [...] over a whole manufacturing complex or trade pollution credits with other companies in their industry instead of a [...] "stack-by-stack" [...] and [...] "pipe-by-pipe" [...] approach, i.e. the so-called [...] "command and control" [...] approach. Such policy and regulatory innovations call for some improved technology based approaches as well as better quality-based approaches, such as leveling out the pollutant loadings and using less expensive technologies to remove the first large bulk of pollutants, followed by higher operation and maintenance (O&M) technologies for the more difficult to treat stacks and pipes. But, the net effect can be a greater reduction of pollutant emissions and effluents than treating each stack or pipe as an independent entity. This is a foundation for most sustainable design approaches, i.e. conducting a life-cycle analysis, prioritizing the most important problems, and matching the technologies and operations to address them. The problems will vary by size (e.g. pollutant loading), difficulty in treating, and feasibility. The most intractable problems are often those that are small but very expensive and difficult to treat, i.e. less feasible. Of course, as with all paradigm shifts, expectations must be managed from both a technical and an operational perspective. [...] Historically, sustainability considerations have been approached by engineers as constraints on their designs. For example, hazardous substances generated by a manufacturing process were dealt with as a waste stream that must be contained and treated. The hazardous waste production had to be constrained by selecting certain manufacturing types, increasing waste handling facilities, and if these did not entirely do the job, limiting rates of production. Green engineering recognizes that these processes are often inefficient economically and environmentally, calling for a comprehensive, systematic life cycle approach.

40|$|While it is dangerously {{tempting to}} think of the city as a fixed built environment, the result of careful {{planning}} and design, it is in fact an ever changing system of infrastructures, buildings, spaces and materials. The commercial and social pressures of modern society demand constant newness and change. Unfortunately most of our cities are not designed or built to accommodate ease of change through disassembly; rather they succumb to demolition and the creation of waste. A strategy of <b>design</b> <b>for</b> <b>disassembly</b> has been successfully implemented in many mass produced products such as computers and cars, but it has not achieved popular or widespread application in the design and construction of cities.

40|$|Living wall {{systems are}} not applied on a large scale, even though they offer {{multiple}} benefits to buildings. They are able to improve the air quality, the insulation values or social and psychological benefits. The aim of this Thesis {{is to increase the}} application of living wall systems by designing a living wall system with the principles of modularity, which should decrease the two biggest disadvantages of living wall systems: the high production cost and the high amount of maintenance. To reach this goal it is important to channel both knowledge about modularity and vertical green. For modularity this means understanding the principles: designing with repeating components, <b>designing</b> <b>for</b> prefabrication, <b>designing</b> <b>for</b> <b>disassembly</b> and <b>designing</b> <b>for</b> a catalogue. In the next step various connections are listed which can be used when <b>designing</b> <b>for</b> <b>disassembly,</b> along with types of façades and building references which apply the use of the principles of modularity. As for vertical green, a clear typology can be seen. Vertical green can be divided into green façades, wall vegetation and living wall systems. Living wall systems can be based on planter boxes, panel systems (of which some use mineral wool) and on felt layers. A history is provided of vertical green, along with a detailed explanation about {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} placing of vertical green on a building. All of these advantages are researched to find out if they can be improved with the means of modularity. These advantages are a first step into the world of innovations that could be used when designing a new living wall system, together with an insight into new innovations regarding modularity. The main research of this report is an analysis of all the living wall systems on the current Dutch market. These systems are explained in their way of working and are separated into components and materials. A conclusion is made about the separability and reusability of the components, as well as the circularity of the materials, along with general data, such as weight, water consumption and lifespan. This information is later used in a Harris profile that defines the type of living wall system that’s best <b>for</b> the <b>design</b> requirements. The design requirements have been determined by researching the context of a location where this living wall system can be installed; the Europoint-complex in Rotterdam. The Harris profile makes clear that planter box can best be used due to their low water consumption, high lifespan and their fit <b>for</b> circular <b>design.</b> In the end a planter box system is designed which can easily be removed from the building skin and replaced by means of modularity, which decreases the maintenance. It has even been adapted so it can be transported by drones, so no persons have to climb up a building. Planter boxes that are recovered from the building can be reused or recycled thanks to the circular design. By designing the system in such a way that it can function as the outer layer of a building, it also decreases the building costs. Finally, the system receives three add-ons, which use innovations to increase the effect certain benefits of living wall systems. These add-ons are part of a design catalogue, which helps the system to be applicable on other locations than the Europoint-complex, depending on the design problems at hand.
