40|$|OBJECTIVE—(1) To measure objectively the {{subjective}} improvement in joint stiffness following intra-articular injections of corticosteroids, and (2) to record changes in joint stiffness {{in the first}} 24  hours after injection to look {{for changes in the}} physical properties of the joint that would be consistent with a crystal synovitis.  METHODS—The study population consisted of 15  patients having 17  metacarpophalangeal joints injected as part of their routine care. Measurements were taken before injection, at 24  hours, and after one week. Outcome variables included articular stiffness, strength, joint range of movement, and subjective scores.  RESULTS—At 24  hours, mean values for stiffness had increased (mean slope from 0. 0085  to 0. 0123  Nm degree- 1; curve area from 0. 1003  to 0. 1555  units), but the increase was not significant. After one week a significant decrease in "elastic stiffness" had occurred (mean slope from 0. 0085  to 0. 0065  Nm degree- 1; P =  0. 025). Significant changes in <b>grip,</b> <b>range</b> of movement, and subjective scores were also found after one week (maximum grip from 75. 3  to 85. 9  N; flexion/extension range from 87. 0  to 102. 4  degrees; pain visual analogue scale (VAS) from 50  mm to 12  mm; stiffness VAS from 65  mm to 27  mm).  CONCLUSIONS—An early increase in joint stiffness in some patients following intra-articular corticosteroids is consistent with a transient synovitis. Symptoms of joint stiffness generally correlate with mechanical measures which provide a useful objective index of acute changes in joint pathophysiology. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the mechanical design, analysis, fabrication, and testing procedures {{of a new}} large-range microgripper {{which is based on}} a flexible hinge structure. The uniqueness of the gripper is that the gripper arms not only provide large <b>gripping</b> <b>range</b> but also deliver approximately rectilinear movement as the displacement in nonworking direction is extremely small. The large <b>gripping</b> <b>range</b> is enabled by a mechanism design based on dual-stage flexure amplifier to magnify the stroke of piezoelectric actuator. The first-stage amplifier is {{a modified version of the}} Scott Russell (SR) mechanism and the second-stage amplifier contains a parallel mechanism. The displacement amplification ratio of the modified SR mechanism in the gripper has been enlarged to 3. 56  times of the conventional design. Analytical static models of the gripper mechanism are developed and validated through finite-element analysis (FEA) simulation. Results show that the <b>gripping</b> <b>range</b> is over 720  µm with a resonant frequency of 70. 7  Hz and negligible displacement in nonworking direction. The total amplification ratio of the input displacement is 16. 13. Moreover, a prototype of the gripper is developed by using aluminium 7075 for experimental testing. Experimental results validate the analytical model and FEA simulation results. The proposed microgripper can be employed in various microassembly applications such as pick-and-place of optical fibre...|$|R
30|$|For gripper manipulators, the <b>gripping</b> <b>range</b> of the {{end-effector}} {{is a major}} parameter, {{which has}} effects on the capacity of gripper manipulation [34]. For 5 -TET mechanism, the <b>gripping</b> <b>range</b> manifests as the variable range of the dihedral angle of H-BA-F. Here, in order to guarantee a stable gripper, nodes F and H should be fully symmetric with strut AB. That makes the variable range of distance between F and H equivalent to the variable range of the dihedral angle H-BA-F. In the initial state of 5 -TET, the gripper F and H are at a certain distance of 600 mm. However, to realize the gripper action, the dihedral angle H-BA-F should open and close based on the initial state, which would be represented by the distance between nodes F and H. The optimization model is set up to get the inputs of the gripper manipulation of 5 -TET. Note that, in the optimization model, the number of state change struts is determined as even numbers to maintain symmetry. The optimal model of the gripper is described as follows.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{understand}} how the commonly used climbing-specific grip techniques and hold depths influence the finger force capacities. Ten advanced climbers performed maximal voluntary force on four different hold depths (from 1 to 4 cm) and in two force directions (antero-posterior and vertical) using three grip techniques (slope, half crimp and full crimp). A specially designed platform instrumented with a 6 -degrees-of-freedom (DoF) force/torque sensor was used to record force values. Results showed that the maximal vertical forces differed significantly according to the hold depth and the <b>grip</b> technique (<b>ranged</b> from 350. 8 N to 575. 7 N). The maximal vertical forces increased according to the hold depth but the form of this increase differed depending on grip technique. These results seemed to be more associated with finger-hold contact/interaction than with internal biomechanical factors. Similar results were revealed for antero-posterior forces (ranged from 69. 9 N to 138. 0 N) but, it was additionally noted that climbers have different hand-forearm posture strategies with slope and crimp grip techniques when applying antero-posterior forces. This point is important as it could influence the body position adopted during climbing according to the chosen grip technique.

40|$|Dear Editor We {{read the}} article by Bagheri et al with great {{interest}} (1). We found the study interesting and comprehensive as four groups of patients, including operative and nonoperative in either pure dislocation or fracture dislocation, were compared in terms of Mayo wrist score, <b>Grip</b> strength, <b>range</b> of motion and radiographic parameters. It seems that the results were comparable to studies by Capo, Chou, Laporte, Malovic, Kremer, Forli and Lutz (Table 1) (2 - 8).

In the current study by Bagheri et al, non-operative treatment is also discussed, which has little literature support so far (1). We wonder what the indications were leading the patient and the surgeon electing nonoperative treatment versus operative intervention. Since the outcomes of non-operative care were comparable to the operative outcomes, weighing the benefits of non surgical management may be an area of further investigation. The authors didn’t describe the operative intervention in detail making comparisons with outer studies difficult.

Methods: Between 2001 and 2006, 4 patients with diaphyseal non-union of the humerus were treated in our institution by intramedullary fibular auto-graft and AO plate fixation. Average age of the patients was 67 years (range, 65 - 69) and BMI (Body Mass Index) : 39 kg/m 2 (range, 35 - 42. 5). There were three females and one male. The patients each had fractures of mid-shaft and junction of middle and proximal thirds. Three were closed fractures and one open fracture had eventual atrophic non-union upon presentation. Data collected retrospectively included <b>grip</b> strength, <b>range</b> of motion, radiographic parameters, and functional outcomes as measured by the DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand) questionnaire. Results: Patients were followed-up for an average of 4 years (range, 3 - 6). Union was achieved in all patients in 3. 2 months (range, 3 - 4) and patients were very satisfied with the treatment.

40|$|Objective The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} whether high baseline pain predicts impairment outcomes in grip strength or wrist range of motion (ROM) at one year after a distal radius fracture (DRF). Impairments occur for less than 15 % of patients. Methods: In this cohort study patients with a DRF were recruited from a hand clinic in London, Ontario. This data was collected at two evaluation time points: at baseline (within the first 10 days after fracture) and at one year after fracture. Baseline pain was assessed using the pain subscale of the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) and classified as high if it exceeded 35 / 50. Grip strength and ROM scores were evaluated at one year and compared to previously defined patient satisfaction benchmarks. Relative risks (RR) were calculated to assess the magnitude of impairment risk with high pain. Results: A sample of 277 patients with a DRF, with a mean age of 60 ± 11. 5 years, was included. The majority of relative risks were not significant and did not support that high baseline pain is a clinically important risk factor for poor impairment scores: grip strength RR 1. 5 CI (0. 69 – 3. 09) and ROM’s flexion-extension RR 1. 2 CI (1. 05 – 1. 36), radial-ulnar deviation RR 1. 1 CI (0. 94 – 1. 29) and pronation-supination RR 1. 0 CI (0. 86 – 1. 38).

40|$|AbstractBetween 2004 and 2010, 189 adult {{patients}} were enrolled on the National Cancer Institute's cross-sectional chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) natural history study. Patients {{were evaluated by}} multiple disease scales and outcome measures, including the 2005 National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Project cGVHD severity scores. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the validity of the NIH scoring variables as determinants of disease severity in severely affected patients in efforts to standardize clinician evaluation and staging of cGVHD. Out of 189 patients enrolled, 125 met the criteria for severe cGVHD on the NIH global score, 62 of whom had moderate disease, with a median of 4 (range, 1 - 8) involved organs. Clinician-assigned average NIH organ score and the corresponding organ scores assigned by subspecialists were highly correlated (r = 0. 64). NIH global severity scores showed significant associations with nearly all functional and quality of life outcome measures, including the Lee Symptom Scale, Short Form- 36 Physical Component Scale, 2 -minute walk, <b>grip</b> strength, <b>range</b> of motion, and Human Activity Profile. Joint/fascia, skin, and lung involvement affected function and quality of life most significantly and showed the greatest correlation with outcome measures. The final Cox model with factors jointly predictive for survival included the time from cGVHD diagnosis (> 49 versus ≤ 49 months, hazard ratio [HR] = 0. 23; P =. 0011), absolute eosinophil count at the time of NIH evaluation (0 - 0. 5 versus > 0. 5 cells/μL, HR = 3. 95; P =. 0006), and NIH lung score (3 versus 0 - 2, HR = 11. 02; P <. 0001). These results demonstrate that NIH organs and global severity scores are reliable measures of cGVHD disease burden. The strong association with subspecialist evaluation suggests that NIH organ and global severity scores are appropriate for clinical and research assessments, and may serve as a surrogate for more complex subspecialist examinations. In this population of severely affected patients, NIH lung score is the strongest predictor of poor overall survival, both alone and after adjustment for other important factors...|$|R
40|$|Surgical Restoration of Grasp Control in Tetraplegia Carina Reinholdt Department of Orthopedics/Hand Surgery, Institute of Clinical Sciences, The Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Göteborg, Sweden ABSTRACT Aim: The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to improve the grasp and release {{function}} of patients with tetraplegia undergoing reconstructive hand surgery. In order to reach this objective, new and more cost-efficient surgical concepts with maintained patient safety were designed. Patients and methods: 112 individuals were assessed pre- and postoperatively on their pinch and <b>grip</b> strength, <b>range</b> of motion (ROM), hand opening, {{as well as a}} satisfactory score (COPM) (retrospective comparative studies I-IV) and dynamic electro-goniometry to assess spasticity (prospective pilot study V). Results: I: Selective release of tight interossei muscles in the hand (distal ulnar intrinsic release) increased the ROM up to 45 %. II: The alphabet procedure (a single-stage combination of procedures) reliably provided tetraplegic patients with pinch, grasp and release function after only one operation and one rehabilitation period. III: The extensor carpi ulnaris tenodesis corrected radial deviation deformity of the wrist joint and increased the grip strength by double. IV: Patients who underwent the alphabet procedure demonstrated significantly more grip strength and opening of the hand compared with patients, who had traditional grip reconstruction. Early active rehabilitation was particularly important after multiple simultaneous procedures. V: Dynamic electro-goniometry proved a feasible method to assess spasticity-reducing surgery by measuring joint angular velocity and repetitions per second. Together with COPM, these assessment points can be used to evaluate the outcome of surgery or non-operative spasticity treatments. Conclusion: This thesis reports development and refinement of several surgical techniques that individually and combined, facilitate the reanimation of grasp control in people with tetraplegia. Rebalancing of the hand by selective release and tendon lengthening techniques enables more favorable mechanical conditions for the forearm, wrist and finger actuators in patients with tightness and spasticity. Shorter total time in the operation room and for rehabilitation with preserved patient safety enforce the recommendation of applying these techniques...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{compare the}} {{outcomes}} of displaced distal radius fractures treated with volar locking plates and with immediate postoperative mobilisation with {{the outcomes of}} these fractures treated with modalities that necessitate 6 wk wrist immobilisation. Methods: A prospective, randomised controlled single-centre trial was conducted with 56 patients who had a displaced radius fracture were randomised to treatment either with a volar locking plate (n = 29), or another treatment modality (n = 27; cast immobilisation with or without wires or external fixator). Outcomes were measured at 12 wk. Functional outcome scores measured were the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) Score; Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand and {{activities of daily living}} (ADLs). Clinical outcomes were wrist range of motion and grip strength. Radiographic parameters were volar inclination and ulnar variance. Results: Patients in the volar locking plate group had significantly better PRWE scores, ADL scores, <b>grip</b> strength and <b>range</b> of extension at three months compared with the control group. All radiological parameters were significantly better in the volar locking plate group at 3 mo. Conclusion: The present study suggests that volar locking plates produced significantly better functional and clinical outcomes at 3 mo compared with other treatment modalities. Anatomical reduction was significantly more likely to be preserved in the plating group. Level of evidence: II...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Comminuted radial head {{fractures}} (Mason type III) {{continue to}} pose a challenge to orthopedic surgeons. When internal fixation is not possible, radial head arthroplasty has been advocated as the treatment of choice. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate clinical and radiological short-term results of patients with Mason type III radial head fractures treated with a cemented bipolar radial prosthesis. Methods: Twelve patients received cemented bipolar radial head hemiarthroplasty for comminuted radial head fractures. In all patients a CT scan was obtained prior to surgical treatment to assess all associated injuries. Postoperatively an early motion protocol was applied. All patients were evaluated clinically and radiologically {{at an average of}} 12. 7 months. Results: According to the Mayo Modified Wrist Score, the Mayo Elbow Performance Score, the functional rating index of Broberg and Morrey, and the DASH Score good to excellent results were obtained. <b>Grip</b> strength and <b>range</b> of motion were almost {{at the level of the}} unaffected contralateral side. Patient satisfaction was high, no instability or signs of loosening of the implant, and only mild signs of osteoarthritis were seen. Conclusion: Overall good to excellent short-term results for primary arthroplasty for comminuted radial head fractures were observed. These encouraging results warrant the conduction of further studies with long-term follow-up and more cases to see if these short-term results can be maintained over time...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Nine {{patients}} with scapholunate instability underwent treatment at Rikshospitalet Senter for Ortopedi from 1996 to 2001. Four males (mean age 38 years) with dynamic instability {{were treated with}} ligament repair; five patients (four males and one female, mean age 31 years) with static instability were treated with the Brunelli procedure, stabilizing the scaphoid with {{a part of the}} flexor carpi radialis tendon. Mean follow-up was 8. 4 (5. 1 - 11. 1) years. The patients were assessed with a questionnaire, a clinical and a radiological evaluation. All patients reported significant improvement of hand function including <b>grip</b> strength and <b>range</b> of motion after the operation, except for one patient with unchanged function in the dynamic group. No statistically significant differences were found among the groups. Pain scores (VAS) were 1. 1 (0. 0 – 2. 9) and 0. 9 (0. 0 – 2. 3) in the dynamic and static groups, respectively. Mean Quick-DASH and Modified Mayo Wrist Scores were 8. 9 and 77. 5 in the dynamic group, and 1. 1 and 90 in the static group. No carpal instability was encountered. Radiologically, slightly increased malalignment and degenerative osteoarthritis was found in the dynamic group. Our limited material demonstrates good results with the Brunelli procedure for static scapholunate instability, suggesting the same procedure also for dynamic cases...|$|R
