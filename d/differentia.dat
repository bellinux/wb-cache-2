5|$|The {{second stage}} of the {{rational}} nexus test looks at whether the basis for differentiation is founded on an intelligible <b>differentia</b> which distinguishes those who are grouped together from those left outside the group. To satisfy the second stage, {{there must be a}} discernible basis of classification. All persons being discriminated against by a law must share a common identifying mark that is not borne by those not discriminated against. Examples of such features include gender, age, race, religion, seniority of professional qualification and area of residence. Another feature that has been accepted by the courts as constituting an intelligible <b>differentia</b> is Singapore citizenship. Singling out a person or object with characteristics not peculiar to itself, but which may conceivably be found in other persons or objects, does not constitute classification. If there is no consistent means of identifying the persons treated differently, the differentiation is arbitrary and the law is invalid. If there is an intelligible <b>differentia,</b> the differentiation is not arbitrary in this sense and it is necessary to proceed to the third stage.|$|E

25|$|The Attorney-General {{submitted}} {{that the}} 15-gram <b>differentia</b> was intelligible and bore a rational {{relation to the}} social purpose of the MDA: to have a deterrent effect on drug trafficking in or through Singapore by large-scale drug traffickers.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle {{examines}} {{the concepts of}} substance and essence (ousia) in his Metaphysics (Book VII), and he concludes that a particular substance {{is a combination of}} both matter and form. In Book VIII, he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum, or the stuff of which it is composed. For example, the matter of a house is the bricks, stones, timbers etc., or whatever constitutes the potential house, while the form of the substance is the actual house, namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other <b>differentia</b> (see also predicables) that let us define something as a house. The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the <b>differentia</b> is the account of the form.|$|E

5000|$|Though Boethius {{is drawing}} from Aristotle's Topics, <b>Differentiae</b> {{are not the}} same as Topics in some ways. Boethius {{arranges}} <b>differentiae</b> through statements, instead of generalized groups as Aristotle does. Stump articulates the difference. They are [...] "expressed as words or phrases whose expansion into appropriate propositions is neither intended nor readily conceivable", unlike Aristotle's clearly defined four groups of Topics. Aristotle had hundreds of topics organized into those four groups, whereas Boethius has twenty-eight [...] "Topics" [...] that are [...] "highly ordered among themselves." [...] This distinction is necessary to understand Boethius as separate from past rhetorical theories.|$|R

25|$|Despite {{sentencing}} {{under the}} MDA being based on general deterrence, {{the court was}} disallowed from considering if the offender had voluntarily assumed the risk of trafficking in controlled drugs. It was unlikely that an offender would know if the substance he was trafficking contained the amount of diamorphine sufficient to fulfil the 15-gram <b>differentia.</b>|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, the court {{acknowledged}} that using a 15-gram <b>differentia</b> {{might not be}} the best method of furthering the social object of the MDA. However, the matter of what would constitute a better <b>differentia</b> was one which reasonable people may not necessarily agree on, and so this was a question of social policy best left to the legislature, not the judiciary. Addressing Yong's contention that in reality the mandatory death penalty only had a limited deterrent effect on drug traffickers, the Court said that it was not within the its purview to determine the mandatory death penalty's efficacy as a deterrent to drug trafficking. Such an issue was a question of policy and should be left to the legislature to decide. If any changes to the mandatory death penalty or the death penalty in general were to be effected, these had to be done by the legislature and not by the Judiciary under the pretence of constitutional interpretation. In addition, while the court acknowledged {{it could be argued that}} there was insufficient evidence of the mandatory death penalty's deterrent effect on serious offences like murder, it could also be said there was insufficient evidence that the mandatory death penalty did not have a deterrent effect.|$|E
25|$|In the Malaysian case Datuk Yong Teck Lee v. Public Prosecutor (1992), the {{plaintiff}} claimed that section27(8) of the Police Act 1967 violated Article8(1) of the Constitution of Malaysia, which provides that all persons are equal {{before the law}} and are entitled to the {{equal protection of the}} law. It was argued that this provision was violated because parliamentarians who participated in illegal demonstrations were subject to a higher mandatory fine as compared to non-parliamentarians who had committed similar offences. The High Court of Malaya applied the doctrine of reasonable classification and identified a rational relation between the <b>differentia</b> and the object of the statute.|$|E

25|$|Agreeing {{with the}} Attorney General's submission, the Court of Appeal {{held that the}} {{mandatory}} death penalty satisfied the reasonable classification test {{used to assess the}} constitutionality of legislation with respect to Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Reiterating the Privy Council's holding in Ong Ah Chuan, the Court found that the 15-gram <b>differentia</b> used in the MDA to determine whether the death penalty should be imposed could not be said to be purely arbitrary, and bore a rational relation to the social object of the MDA which was to prevent the growth of drug addiction in Singapore by stamping out the illicit drug trade. There was nothing unreasonable in the legislature concluding that a wholesale dealer operating higher up in the distributive pyramid required a stronger deterrent than smaller scale dealers. It was up to the legislature to determine where the appropriate quantitative boundary was to lie between the two classes of dealers. The Court also held that the quantity of addictive drugs trafficked was broadly proportionate to both the quantity of addictive drugs brought on to the market, as well as the likely harm suffered by society {{as a result of the}} offender's crime.|$|E

500|$|In 1909, the Supreme Court of the United States propounded {{a test to}} {{determine}} the reasonableness of a classification, stating that the classification [...] "must always rest upon some real and substantial distinction bearing a reasonable and just relation to the things in respect to which the classification is made". Based on this principle, the Supreme Court of India subsequently formulated a two-stage test {{to determine}} if a classification made by a law was constitutional. The relevant stages were (1) whether the classification was founded on an intelligible differentia; and (2) whether the <b>differentia</b> had a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the law in question.|$|E
500|$|In its ruling, the Court of Appeal cited Ong Ah Chuan, wherein Lord Diplock {{held that}} Article 12(1), which sets out the {{principle}} of equality before the law and {{equal protection of the}} law, [...] "prohibits laws which require that some individuals within a single class should be treated by way of punishment more harshly than others". In essence, persons belonging to the same class should be treated in the same manner. Bearing in mind the separation of powers, Lord Diplock was of the opinion that it was up to the legislature to decide the <b>differentia</b> distinguishing different classes of individuals. If the factor which the legislature adopts as constituting the dissimilarity in circumstances is not purely arbitrary but bears a reasonable relation to the social object of the law, there is no inconsistency with Article 12(1) of the Constitution.|$|E
500|$|In Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor (2010), the Court of Appeal had to {{determine}} the validity of a differentiating factor prescribed by the legislature for distinguishing between different classes of offenders for sentencing purposes. In that case, the differentiating factor {{was found in the}} Misuse of Drugs Act ("MDA"), which stipulated that an accused trafficking in more than [...] of diamorphine (heroin) would result in him or her facing a mandatory death penalty upon conviction. Following its previous decision in Nguyen Tuong Van v. Public Prosecutor (2005), which had applied Ong Ah Chuan, the Court applied the rational nexus test and found that the 15-gram <b>differentia</b> bore a reasonable relation to the social object of the MDA. The Court also noted that the [...] "quantity of addictive drugs trafficked is not only broadly proportionate to the quantity of addictive drugs brought onto the illicit market, but also broadly proportionate to the scale of operations of the drug dealer and, hence, broadly proportionate to the harm likely to be posed to society by the offender's crime." [...] Although Taw Cheng Kong was not cited in this case, the test applied was substantially similar to that which it enunciated in Taw Cheng Kong.|$|E

6000|$|Thirdly, let us {{suppose that}} we have {{selected}} another Adjunct, which we may call [...] "y", and have subdivided the x-Class into the two Classes whose <b>Differentiæ</b> are [...] "y" [...] and [...] "y'", and {{that we have}} assigned the North-West Cell to the one (which we may call [...] "the xy-Class"), and the North-East Cell to the other (which we may call [...] "the xy'-Class").|$|R

500|$|Similarly, {{where an}} over-inclusive {{classification}} is concerned, a rational relation still {{exists between the}} <b>differentia</b> adopted and the legislative object. Thus, it is tolerated under the rational nexus test in Singapore. While the effect of an over-inclusive classification may be to accord similar treatment to persons differently placed, courts have nonetheless justified {{it on the ground}} that the exigencies of the situation require such classification. The US Supreme Court case Hirabayashi v. United States (1943) is an example of this principle. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order requiring, among other things, all persons of Japanese ancestry within a designated military area to be [...] "within their place of residence between the hours of 8 p.m. and 6 a.m." [...] and to report to the authorities to register for removal from the military area. The defendant, Gordon Hirabayashi, was convicted of violating the curfew and the registration requirement. The order was arguably over-inclusive as it did not distinguish between Japanese Americans who were loyal to the US and those in respect of which there was evidence of disloyalty. Although the Court noted that distinctions between citizens {{solely on the basis of}} ancestry [...] "are, by their very nature, odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality", because the US was at war with Japan the race-based classification bore a rational relation to the aim of the order, which was to protect from sabotage war materials and utilities in areas believed to be in danger of Japanese invasion and air attack. The Court said: [...] "We cannot close our eyes to the fact, demonstrated by experience, that, in time of war, residents having ethnic affiliations with an invading enemy may be a greater source of danger than those of a different ancestry." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Necessary exists 'due-to-Its-Self', {{and has no}} quiddity/essence (mahiyya) {{other than}} {{existence}} (wujud). Furthermore, It is 'One' (wahid ahad) since there cannot {{be more than one}} 'Necessary-Existent-due-to-Itself' without <b>differentia</b> (fasl) to distinguish them from each other. Yet, to require <b>differentia</b> entails that they exist 'due-to-themselves' as well as 'due to what is other than themselves'; and this is contradictory. However, if no <b>differentia</b> distinguishes them from each other, then there is no sense in which these 'Existents' are not one and the same. [...] Avicenna adds that the 'Necessary-Existent-due-to-Itself' has no genus (jins), nor a definition (hadd), nor a counterpart (nadd), nor an opposite (did), and is detached (bari) from matter (madda), quality (kayf), quantity (kam), place (ayn), situation (wad), and time (waqt).|$|E
6000|$|...

50|$|When {{a system}} of {{definitions}} is constructed with genera and <b>differentiae,</b> the definitions {{can be thought of}} as nodes forming a hierarchy or—more generally—a directed acyclic graph; a node that has no predecessor is a most general definition; each node along a directed path is more differentiated (or more derived) than any one of its predecessors, and a node with no successor is a most differentiated (or a most derived) definition.|$|R
