25|$|I {{felt that}} air was forced <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> I {{could not speak}} and I could not close my mouth. I could {{understand}} well everything said to me. Other times I {{feel that there is}} food in my mouth and there is also a lot of salivation. I cannot speak.|$|E
500|$|... "I scooped {{it out of}} {{the sink}} and threw it into the bin. I was so lucky I didn't put my fingers <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> or scratch my eye as I could have got this poison inside me." ...|$|E
60|$|It is needless; for {{louder and}} louder every moment swells up a sound which makes my heart leap <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> and my mare into the air.|$|E
6000|$|I {{waited patiently}} for the Lord; and He {{inclined}} unto me, and heard my [...] calling. He brought me also {{out of the}} horrible pit, out of the miry [...] clay, and set my feet upon the rock. And He hath put a new song <b>into</b> [...] <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> even a thanksgiving unto our God.--Ps. xl. 2, 3.|$|R
60|$|Fatigued with my long-continued efforts, and panting for breath, I {{felt myself}} {{completely}} incapacitated for any further exertion. I {{rolled up the}} sleeve of my frock, and squeezed the moisture it contained <b>into</b> <b>my</b> parched <b>mouth.</b> But the few drops I managed to obtain gave me little relief, and I sank down for {{a moment with a}} sort of dogged apathy, from which I was aroused by Toby, who had devised a plan to free us from the net in which we had become entangled.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I read no {{letter from}} fellow of mine. Yonder is a vile forgery. Narcisse's own, most likely. No {{one else would}} have so profaned her as to put such words <b>into</b> her <b>mouth!</b> <b>My</b> dear {{faithful}} foster-brother--have they murdered him?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't {{put words}} <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> that I don't mean,' said Jeremiah, {{sticking}} to his figurative expression with tenacious and impenetrable obstinacy: 'I mean dropped down upon me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have you {{anything}} more to say, O Kalubi-that-is-to-be? Now {{of a sudden}} the god puts it <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> to ask if you have anything more to say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is also to}} eat with," [...] {{replied the}} boy. [...] "If I didn't put food <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> and eat it, I would get hungry and starve.|$|E
60|$|Already {{they were}} losing their tempers, {{slapping}} their customers with wet towels and jabbing great brushfuls of soap <b>into</b> their <b>mouths.</b> <b>My</b> barber was leaning {{over my face}} with his whole body. In another minute {{one or the other}} of them would have been sufficiently provoked to have dealt his customer a blow behind the ear.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not so sure}} of that, Nell. I send {{it rather}} slowly out through <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> but I think it jumps <b>into</b> <b>my</b> brain. I wonder how it gets in; whether by the eyes, or ears, or mouth--perhaps it goes up the nose." ...|$|R
6000|$|Howkan smirked with self-appreciation. His {{hair was}} parted in the middle. [...] "Nay, {{from the paper}} it comes, O Imber. Never have my ears heard. From the paper it comes, through <b>my</b> eyes, <b>into</b> <b>my</b> head, and out of <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> to thee. Thus it comes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{pleasant}} it is!" [...] remarked I, {{while the}} snowflakes flew <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> {{the moment it}} was opened. [...] "How very mild and balmy is this country air!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} wouldn't put slang phrases <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> Cora. If I {{think that a}} man intrudes upon me, I am of course bound {{to let him know}} my opinion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He did,' {{answered}} Fledgeby. 'The assassin. Lammle. He {{rubbed it}} <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> and up {{my nose and}} down my throat--Ow! Ow! Ow! Ah--h--h--h! Ugh!--to prevent my crying out, and then cruelly assaulted me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I don't {{know how}} long I had been asleep when I was roused by a shake on my shoulder. The room was pitch dark, and I felt a hand {{suddenly}} clapped over <b>my</b> <b>mouth.</b> Then a strong smell of whisky and tobacco saluted my nostrils, and a whisper stole <b>into</b> <b>my</b> ear-- ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{inevitable}} that Red-Eye should win {{in the struggle against}} the two of us. The reason he did not finish us off immediately was that the Swift One clogged his movements. She had regained her breath and was beginning to resist. He would not release his clutch on her hair, and this handicapped him. He got a grip on my arm. It {{was the beginning of the}} end for me. He began to draw me toward him into a position where he could sink his teeth <b>into</b> <b>my</b> throat. His <b>mouth</b> was open, and he was grinning. And yet, though he had just begun to exert his strength, in that moment he wrenched my shoulder so that I suffered from it for the remainder of my life.|$|R
5000|$|I {{definitely}} {{wanted to}} get better at writing, and those things happened simultaneously with trying to read better. I would write tons of stuff in my head, and forget. Some songs on Being There, I don't think I ever wrote any lyrics down ... To fight that, I started writing words on paper and making up melodies to go with them. By writing things down, and putting more words <b>into</b> <b>my</b> head, it put more words in <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> when I turned on the tape recorder to sing.|$|R
6000|$|My heart came up <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> with mingled {{horror and}} triumph. I {{felt like a}} bloodhound who gets {{on the trail of}} his man. I would track him down now, no doubt--my father's murderer! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nigger woman," [...] {{broke out}} Oliver; [...] "I never used such words; I {{never even thought}} them, and you are an impertinent fellow to put them <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth.</b> Nigger woman! Good heavens! It's desecration." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{they call}} me on board this ship--but if I am to be a witness, let me swear freely; I don't wish to have words put <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> or idees chained to me with iron." ...|$|E
40|$|Well I {{never know}} I {{would make it}} back much less get in without Matron seeing me and cutting my tail for being outside without permission. Bread and water for a week. Plus, if she ever {{find out about the}} commotion I just cause! But I was lucky for as soon as I reach up to the house I could tell from all the noise Matron wasnâ€™t there, for the girls only carry on like that when she turn her back leave poor Aunt in charge. So I change <b>into</b> <b>my</b> house dress and I get inside without a soul see me. But my heart was still in <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> from the running and the fright so that if anybody did say one word to me that evening, I would just start to bawl. Then I would let <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> run away with me and tell them everything. Then dog would nyam my supper for Matron bound to hear...|$|R
60|$|Nour. I burn, I {{more than}} burn; I am all fire. See how <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> and {{nostrils}} flame expire! I'll not come near myself-- Now I'm a burning lake, it rolls and flows; I'll rush, and pour it all upon my foes. Pull, pull that reverend piece of timber near: Throw't on--'tis dry--'twill burn-- Ha, ha! how my old husband crackles there! Keep him down, keep him down; turn him about: I know him,--he'll but whiz, and strait go out. Fan me, you winds: What, not one breath of air? I'll burn them all, and yet have flames to spare. Quench me: Pour on whole rivers. 'Tis in vain: Morat stands there {{to drive them}} back again: With those huge billows in his hands, he blows New fire <b>into</b> <b>my</b> head: My brain-pan glows. See! see! there's Aureng-Zebe too takes his part; But he blows all his fire <b>into</b> <b>my</b> heart[4].|$|R
60|$|I {{went right}} along, not fixing up any {{particular}} plan, but just trusting to Providence {{to put the}} right words in <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> when the time come; for I'd noticed that Providence always did put the right words in <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> if I left it alone.|$|R
6000|$|Nora paused {{again before}} she replied. [...] "As nearly as I {{know how to}} do in such words as he would put <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth.</b> I shall strive to write just what I think he would wish me to write." ...|$|E
60|$|The day was breaking, and in {{the gray}} light of early dawn I could see the little craft laboring under her rag of a sail {{in a manner that}} sent my heart <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> {{although}} I'm not given to being timorous on the water.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't call it home, Miss Mohun,' he said. 'I {{have not}} had that these many years; but I declare, the first sound of our county dialect, when I got out at the station, made my heart leap <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth.</b> I could have shaken hands with the fellow.' ...|$|E
50|$|<b>My</b> <b>mouth's</b> {{bonds are}} loosed by my city-god.|$|R
50|$|He looses {{the bonds}} of Seth from <b>my</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... --I let her bawl away, said Mr Casey. It was a {{cold day}} and to keep up my heart I had (saving your presence, ma'am) a quid of Tullamore in <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> and sure I couldn't say a word in any case because <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> was full of tobacco juice.|$|R
60|$|Sleep for a {{long time}} fled my eyelids; and just as I was {{beginning}} to feel quiet stealing over my limbs, and settling densely on my mind, a noise at my head startled me broad awake again, and, I will frankly confess it, brought my heart <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|E
60|$|My heart leaped <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> fit {{to choke}} me. The moment had come when {{everything}} {{which we had}} done would be discovered, for he could not fail to see Seth if he stepped behind the screen, or of knowing what we had done {{when he looked at}} the contents of the casks.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, {{my friends}} and fellow-sinners, now I told you when I began, that I didn't know a word of what I {{was going to say}} to you (and no, I did not!), but that it was all one to me, because I knew the Lord would put <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> the words I wanted.' ...|$|E
50|$|Versicle: O let <b>my</b> <b>mouth</b> {{be filled}} with thy praise.|$|R
50|$|When food {{is still}} in <b>my</b> <b>mouth,</b> I will not speak.|$|R
60|$|O'CLEARY. [With {{a look of}} {{profound}} meaning] Not with <b>my</b> <b>mouth.</b>|$|R
