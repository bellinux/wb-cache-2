40|$|Female common eiders (Somateria mollissima) starve {{during the}} nesting stage and may lose 30 - 45 % of their initial body mass, mostly through lipid mobilization. In this study, {{the effects of}} fasting on the blood {{concentrations}} of three lipid-soluble organochlorines (OCs: polychlorinated biphenyl [PCB]- 153; 1 -dichloro- 2, 2 -bis (p-chlorophenyl) ethylene [p,p'-DDE]; and hexachlorobenzene [HCB]) were examined <b>in</b> <b>eiders</b> breeding <b>in</b> the high Arctic. Blood samples were taken from females (n = 47) at day 5 and day 20 of the incubation period. The mean wet weight concentrations of PCB- 153 and p,p'-DDE increased strongly between day 5 and day 20 (3. 6 and 8. 2 -fold, respectively), while HCB increased less (1. 7 -fold). There was a strong negative association between daily increase in PCB- 153 and clutch size, and a weaker relationship for p,p'-DDE, suggesting that maternal transfer to the eggs is a significant pathway of elimination of OCs <b>in</b> <b>eiders.</b> Moreover, poor body condition (body mass controlled for body size) late in the incubation period was associated with strong daily increase of both p,p'-DDE and PCB- 153, which may suggest that the release of these compounds increases when lipid reserves become depleted. For HCB, the increase was mainly associated with increase in blood lipid concentrations, and weakly {{to the amount of}} burned lipids. The causes for the differences between the compounds are, however, poorly understood. Although the absolute levels of OCs <b>in</b> <b>eiders</b> were relatively low, their rapid build-up during incubation is worrying as it coincides with poor body condition and weakened immune systems...|$|R

40|$|International audienceImmunity is {{hypothesized}} to share limited resources with other physiological functions and may mediate life history trade-offs, for example between reproduction and survival. However, vertebrate immune defense {{is a complex}} system that consists of three components. To date, no study has assessed all of these components for the same animal model and within a given situation. Previous studies have determined that the acquired immunity of common eiders (Somateria mollissima) is suppressed during incubation. The present paper aims to assess the innate immune response <b>in</b> fasting <b>eiders</b> <b>in</b> relation to their initial body condition. Innate immunity was assessed by measuring plasma nitric oxide (NO) levels, prior to and after injection of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a method which is easily applicable to many wild animals. Body condition index and corticosterone levels were subsequently determined as indicators of body condition and stress level prior to LPS injection. The innate immune response <b>in</b> <b>eiders</b> did not vary significantly throughout the incubation period. The innate immune response of eiders did not vary significantly {{in relation to their}} initial body condition but decreased significantly when corticosterone levels increased. However, NO levels after LPS injection were significantly and positively related to initial body condition, while there was a significant negative relationship with plasma corticosterone levels.

Female ornamentation may be an artefact of a genetic correlation with male ornamentation, but this possibility can be disregarded if the ornament only occurs in females. Female-specific white wing bars <b>in</b> <b>eiders</b> (Somateria mollissima) have been suggested to indicate individual quality, and we studied size variation in this trait in relation to key fitness components and quality attributes. We found that clutch size, body condition, female age, hatching date and success were unrelated to female ornament size; ornament size was explained by its size in the previous year. In contrast, good body condition was associated with hatching success.

40|$|Although {{physiological}} {{traits and}} phenology {{are thought to}} be evolved traits, they often show marked variation within populations, which may be related to extrinsic factors. For example, trace elements such as mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) alter biochemical processes within wildlife that may affect migration and breeding. While there is a growing understanding of how contaminants may influence wildlife physiology, studies addressing these interactions in free-living species are still limited. We examined how four non-essential trace elements (cadmium, Hg, Pb and selenium) interacted with physiological and breeding measures known to influence breeding in a free-living population of common eider ducks (Somateria mollissima). We collected blood from female eiders as they arrived at a breeding colony in northern Canada. Blood was subsequently assessed for baseline corticosterone (CORT), immunoglobulin Y (IgY), and the four trace elements. We used model selection to identify which elements varied most with CORT, IgY, arrival condition, and arrival timing. We then used path analysis to assess how the top two elements from the model selection process (Hg and Pb) varied with metrics known to influence reproduction. We found that arrival date, blood Hg, CORT, and IgY showed significant inter-annual variation. While blood Pb concentrations were low, blood Pb levels significantly increased with later arrival date of the birds, and varied negatively with eider body condition, suggesting that even at low blood concentrations, Pb may be related to lower investment <b>in</b> reproduction <b>in</b> <b>eiders.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, blood Hg concentrations were positively correlated with eider body condition, indicating that fatter birds also had higher Hg burdens. Overall, our results suggest that although blood Hg and Pb concentrations were below no-effect levels, these low level concentrations of known toxic metals show significant relationships with breeding onset and condition <b>in</b> female <b>eider</b> ducks, factors that could influence reproductive success in this species...|$|R

40|$|Life-history theory {{predicts that}} {{increased}} current reproductive effort {{should lead to}} a fitness cost. This cost of reproduction may be observed as reduced survival or future reproduction, and {{may be caused by}} temporal suppression of immune function in stressed or hard-working individuals. In birds, consideration of the costs of incubating eggs has largely been neglected in favour of the costs of brood rearing. We manipulated incubation demand in two breeding seasons (2000 and 2001) <b>in</b> female common <b>eiders</b> (Somateria mollissima) by creating clutches of three and six eggs (natural range 3 - 6 eggs). The common eider is a long-lived sea-duck where females do not eat during the incubation period. Mass loss increased and immune function (lymphocyte levels and specific antibody response to the non-pathogenic antigens diphtheria and tetanus toxoid) was reduced in females incubating large clutches. The increased incubation effort among females assigned to large incubation demand did not lead to adverse effects on current reproduction or return rate in the next breeding season. However, large incubation demand resulted in long-term fitness costs through reduced fecundity the year after manipulation. Our data show that <b>in</b> <b>eiders,</b> a long-lived species, the cost of high incubation demand is paid in the currency of reduced future fecundity, possibly mediated by reduced immune function...|$|R

Captive <b>eiders</b> <b>in</b> their hatch-year did not fractionate nitrogen isotopes, potentially indicating preferential protein allocation associated with growth. Six percent of female eiders sampled molted primary feathers on their breeding grounds, which had not been previously substantiated. Tissue samples from both genders corroborated dietary shifts inherent in switching from a marine to terrestrial diet. Carbon isotopes of feathers from satellite-transmittered males were correlated with longitude of their known wing molt locations indicating that the gradient of carbon isotopes can be used to draw inferences about molt location of eiders...|$|R

We investigated the presence of kin-based sociality among females <b>in</b> the common <b>eider</b> (Somateria mollisima), a colonial nesting sea duck that exhibits high levels of natal philopatry in females. Previous studies of female sociality <b>in</b> common <b>eiders</b> have been restricted to observations during brood rearing. However, aggregations of female common eiders are also observed during other periods {{of the life cycle}} such as colony arrival and nesting. Here we apply a novel, empirical framework using molecular markers and field sampling to genetically characterize female social groups at several stages of the common eider life cycle. When compared with mean estimates of interindividual relatedness for the entire colony, significantly higher levels of relatedness were found between females within groups arriving to the colony in flight, between females and nearest neighbors at the time of nest site selection, and between groups of females departing the colony with ducklings. Both full-sibling and half-sibling equivalent relationships were also found within these groups. Therefore, throughout each of several stages including in-flight colony arrival, nesting, and brood rearing, we provide the first genetically confirmed evidence of female kin-based social groups <b>in</b> common <b>eiders</b> and anseriformes <b>in</b> general.

Other studies have observed that, whilst adult <b>eiders</b> <b>in</b> northern latitudes experience less predation, there can be much higher levels of predation on their nests and young. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate why males at an <b>eider</b> colony <b>in</b> Svalbard were present for longer than elsewhere in their range, and whether this was related to protection from high predation levels. Through an observational study design, this study mapped population and predator dynamics within an eider colony near Longyearbyen, Svalbard. This study found that males were present for several weeks after the first females had started incubating, and once most males left the colony there was an increase in predation. Success of predators was higher at unattended nests; however overall success of predators was not found to be significantly lower if males were present in addition to females. If males were present at the nest, females were less likely to leave their nest to respond to gulls, allowing females to conserve energy and leave nests covered. The possibility that the tendency of males to remain with females for longer has emerged from asynchronous breeding or extra-pair mating is discussed, but the findings from this study indicate that it is a direct response to high levels of predation...|$|R

Trials of the underwater playback system (UPS) gave significant reductions <b>in</b> <b>eider</b> numbers of 50 - 80 % while a control trial with the playback of an unassociated noise gave no reduction in numbers. The mean return time of birds to the farm after chasing by boat also increased significantly. As the presence of workers on mussel farms reduces the number of eiders feeding there, the UPS is a useful deterrent when workers are not present. The long-term habituation of ducks to the system was negligible when workers are absent, providing there is occasionally reinforcement of the deterrent by boat chasing.
