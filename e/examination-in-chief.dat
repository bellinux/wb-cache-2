500|$|On 30 May Ballantine {{called the}} Claimant to the stand. During his <b>examination-in-chief,</b> the Claimant {{answered}} questions on Arthur Orton, whom {{he described as}} [...] "a large-boned man with sharp features and a lengthy face slightly marked with smallpox". He had lost sight of Orton between 1862 and 1865, but they had met again in Wagga Wagga, where the Claimant had discussed his inheritance. Under cross-examination the Claimant was evasive when pressed for further details {{of his relationship with}} Orton, saying that he did not wish to incriminate himself. After questioning him on his visit to Wapping, Hawkins asked him directly: [...] "Are you Arthur Orton?" [...] to which he replied [...] "I am not". The Claimant displayed considerable ignorance when questioned about his time at Stonyhurst. He could not identify Virgil, confused Latin with Greek, and did not understand what chemistry was. He caused a sensation when he declared that he had seduced Katherine Doughty and that the sealed package given to Gosford, the contents of which he earlier claimed not to recall, contained instructions to be followed in the event of her pregnancy. Rohan McWilliam, in his chronicle of the affair, comments that from that point on the Tichborne family were fighting not only for their estates but for Katherine Doughty's honour.|$|E

60|$|Charles {{went through}} his <b>examination-in-chief</b> quite swimmingly. He {{answered}} with promptitude. He identified the prisoner without the slightest hesitation {{as the man who}} had swindled him under the various disguises of the Reverend Richard Peploe Brabazon, the Honourable David Granton, Count von Lebenstein, Professor Schleiermacher, Dr. Quackenboss, and others. He had not the slightest doubt of the man's identity. He could swear to him anywhere. I thought, for my own part, he was a trifle too cocksure. A certain amount of hesitation would have been better policy. As to the various swindles, he detailed them in full, his evidence to be supplemented by that of bank officials and other subordinates. In short, he left Finglemore not a leg to stand upon.|$|E

50|$|In law, {{cross-examination}} is {{the interrogation}} of a witness called by one's opponent. It is preceded by direct examination (in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, South Africa, India and Pakistan known as <b>examination-in-chief)</b> {{and may be}} followed by a redirect (re-examination in England, Scotland, Australia, Canada, South Africa, India, Hong Kong, and Pakistan).|$|E
5000|$|The [...] direct {{examination}} or <b>examination-in-chief</b> is one {{stage in the}} process of adducing evidence from witnesses in a court of law. Direct examination is the questioning of a witness by the party who called him or her, in a trial. Direct examination is usually performed to elicit evidence in support of facts which will satisfy a required element of a party's claim or defense.|$|E

50|$|Adversarial: In {{common law}} systems, an {{adversarial}} or accusatory approach {{is used to}} adjudicate guilt or innocence. The assumption is that the truth {{is more likely to}} emerge from the open contest between the prosecution and the defense in presenting the evidence and opposing legal arguments with a judge acting as a neutral referee and as the arbiter of the law. In several jurisdictions in more serious cases, there is a jury to determine the facts, although some common law jurisdictions have abolished the jury trial. This polarizes the issues, with each competitor acting in its own self-interest, and so presenting the facts and interpretations of the law in a deliberately biased way. The intention is that through a process of argument and counter-argument, <b>examination-in-chief</b> and cross-examination, each side will test the truthfulness, relevancy, and sufficiency of the opponent's evidence and arguments. To maintain fairness, there is a presumption of innocence, and the burden of proof lies on the prosecution. Critics of the system argue that the desire to win {{is more important than the}} search for truth. Further, the results are likely to be affected by structural inequalities. Those defendants with resources can afford to hire the best lawyers. Some trials are—or were—of a more summary nature, as certain questions of evidence were taken as resolved (see handhabend and backberend).|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this article investigates the extent to which witnesses who testified in the Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) report the experience as positive or negative. It also seeks to identify the factors that contribute to these evaluations. It reports the results of structured interviews conducted with 171 witnesses who testified in the SCSL. The finding that emerges most strongly is that the experience of testifying was positive for the majority of witnesses. The courtroom environment was experienced as supportive, and witnesses rated the experiences of both <b>examination-in-chief</b> and cross-examination as being more positive than negative, with <b>examination-in-chief</b> being the more positive of the two. The findings suggest that a positive testimony experience can be predicted when a witness does not feel worried at the prospect of testifying, feels respected by court staff and, to a lesser extent, has a positive experience of cross-examination...|$|E
40|$|This paper synthesises the {{existing}} literature on the contemporary conception of ‘real world’ and compares it with similar notions such as ‘authentic’ and ‘work integrated learning’. While the term ‘real world’ may be partly dependent on the discipline, {{it does not necessarily}} follow that the criterion-referenced assessment of ‘real world’ assessment must involve criteria and performance descriptors that are discipline specific. Two examples of summative assessment (court report and trial process exercise) from a final year core subject at the Queensland University of Technology, LWB 432 Evidence, emphasise real world learning, are authentic, innovative and better prepare students for the transition into the workplace than more generic forms of assessment such as tutorial participation or oral presentations. The court report requires students to attend a criminal trial in a Queensland Court and complete a two page report on what they saw in practice compared with what they learned in the classroom. The trial process exercise is a 50 minute written closed book activity conducted in tutorials, where students plan questions that they would ask their witness in <b>examination-in-chief,</b> plan questions that they would ask their opponent’s witness in cross-examination, plan questions that they would ask in reexamination given what their opponent asked in cross-examination, and prepare written objections to their opponent’s questions. The trial process exercise simulates the real world, whereas the court report involves observing the real world, and both assessment items are important to the role of counsel. The design of the criterion-referenced assessment rubrics for the court report and trial process exercise is justified by the literature. Notably, the criteria and performance descriptors are not necessarily law specific and this paper highlights the parts that may be easily transferred to other disciplines...|$|E
40|$|The view of {{discourse}} as serving transactional and interactional purposes cascades into practical realities in courtroom exchanges. As an institutional setting, the law courts exemplify a typical social domain where language provides {{the basis for}} conveying information; promoting meaningful and goal-directive social and interactional exchanges. Whether in civil or criminal litigations, the proceedings rely on linguistic facilities for accomplishing communicative actions. Language thus remains the sole ‘legal tender’ and the major instrument for prosecuting the cases and resolving conflicts brought before the courts. This paper is motivated by the increasing but interesting challenges lay participants face in the courtrooms as they are confronted with language use {{that is different from}} their day-to-day experiences. The study discusses these peculiar communicative interactions in a law court in Lagos, Nigeria against the backdrop of very little efforts in courtroom discourse in non-native English speaking contexts. Specifically, this paper focuses mainly on an aspect of courtroom discourse (i. e. <b>examination-in-chief),</b> a procedural questioning session which provides the basis for presenting the plaintiff’s arguments and information through the plaintiff’s counsel. The data used in this work were drawn from a civil suit filed in a Lagos High Court by a complainant in connection with a dispute on a property in central Lagos. Using insights from discourse analysis and theoretical construct based on Genre Analysis (e. g. Hasan’s Generic Structure Potential) as well as other relevant constructs, the study analyses discourse features and strategies deployed by active participants in the proceedings. The study finds that legal proceedings contextualized within a given L 2 sociolinguistic and lingual-legal jurisdiction helps to project some of the peculiar features of a non-native English in legal domains. Apart from identifying some peculiar discourse patterns that are institutional-based, courtroom proceedings in this legal culture demonstrates discourse strategies that conflate with similar features in other jurisdictions. That only supports the belief of a common source for most legal systems with colonial experiences as well as the universal applicability of judicial decisions. The complex natures of legal texts that are highlighted merely corroborate previous works in this area. The study concludes by demonstrating how language is used to perform actions that are goal-directive in this domain using the Speech Act model...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{takes as}} its {{starting}} point the insights {{provided by a}} number of authors (Bhatia 1993, 2002, 2004; Bhatia / Candlin / Engsberg / Trosborg 2003; Bhatia / Gotti 2006; Candlin / Bhatia / Jensen 2002; Drew / Heritage 1992; Garzone 2003; Goodrich 1988; Gotti 2003; Maley 1994; Swales 1990, 1996, 2004; Tessuto 2003) to examine discourse and professional practices in employment tribunals first in a national and then in an international context. With a view to investigating legal discourse in different legal systems, the chapter examines the institutional constraints on discourse processes in employment cases at Employment Tribunals in the UK, the European Union Civil Service Tribunal in Luxembourg, and the International Labour Organization Administrative Tribunal (ILOAT) in Geneva. Although in all cases the pragmatic function is the presentation of complaints by employees against their employers for the purpose of obtaining compensation or reinstatement, the procedural rules shaping the discourse are strikingly different, with consequent variation in generic structure and lexical content. In examining the institutional procedures and case materials, it is argued that Employment Tribunals in the UK, standing firmly in the common law tradition, provide for courtroom hearings in which the parties present their evidence orally, following the classic sequence of <b>examination-in-chief</b> and cross-examination. On the other hand, at the European Union Civil Service Tribunal (where cases may be heard in any of the 23 official languages of the EU, depending on the language of the application) and at the ILOAT, the proceedings (in English or French) bear a stronger resemblance to the civil law tradition, with most or all of the discourse taking the form of written pleadings. The jurisdiction of the EU Civil Service Tribunal is supranational, and that of the ILOAT international, dealing with complaints lodged by staff members respectively of EU and UN organizations. In the case of the European Union Civil Service Tribunal, written pleadings may be accompanied by hearings. However, {{in the case of the}} ILOAT, the holding of courtroom hearings would require the parties to travel from all over the world. Partly due to this constraint, the discourse is structured in an entirely different manner compared to the national tribunal, with claims presented and argumentation constructed almost exclusively on the basis of written documents, in a genre chain (Fairclough 2003 : 31) consisting of the complaint, the defendant’s reply, the complainant’s rejoinder, the defendant’s surrejoinder, and finally the judgment. This enables the ILOAT to deal with cases entirely on the basis of written pleadings, with applications for hearings seldom allowed. An examination of the terminology in English in the three Tribunals, one national, one supranational, and one international, reflects significant divergences in legal cultures, as the parties seek to construct and interpret meanings while complying with the institutional constraints prevailing in each of the systems...|$|E
