5|$|Along {{with other}} veterans' organisations, HIAG campaigned for the {{immediate}} amnesty and <b>early</b> <b>release</b> of war criminals still in Allied captivity. This issue was significant, as most of these organisations made their cooperation {{in the area of}} rearmament contingent on the satisfactory resolution in this area. It was partly for this reason that the West German government was sympathetic to the fate of these individuals and made every effort to secure their <b>early</b> <b>release.</b> Chancellor Adenauer even met with Kurt Meyer in Werl Prison when he went there on an inspection tour.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1968, {{his father}} John S. McCain Jr. was named {{commander}} of all U.S. {{forces in the}} Vietnam theater, and the North Vietnamese offered McCain <b>early</b> <b>release</b> {{because they wanted to}} appear merciful for propaganda purposes, and also to show other POWs that elite prisoners were willing to be treated preferentially. McCain refused repatriation unless every man taken in before him was also released. Such <b>early</b> <b>release</b> was prohibited by the POWs' interpretation of the military Code of Conduct which states in Article III: “I will accept neither parole nor special favors from the enemy”. To prevent the enemy from using prisoners for propaganda, officers were to agree to be released in the order in which they were captured.|$|E
5|$|Dotty, {{whose real}} name is Kirsty, was {{conceived}} in a one-night stand between Nick Cotton (John Altman) and an alcoholic woman named Sandy (Caroline Pegg).

Upon his <b>early</b> <b>release</b> in April 2008, Nick took custody of Dotty, telling her that Sandy had died in a car crash.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, as Berkman {{finished}} {{the fifth year}} of his sentence, he applied to the Pennsylvania Board of Pardons. Having served as his own attorney, Berkman had failed to object to the trial judge's rulings and thus had no legal basis for an appeal; a pardon was his only hope for <b>early</b> <b>release.</b> The Board of Pardons denied his application in October 1897. A second application was rejected in early 1899.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, Kaspersky {{was granted}} an <b>early</b> <b>release</b> from his {{military}} service {{and left the}} defense ministry {{to take a job}} at the Information Technology Center of a private company KAMI, in order to work on his antivirus product full-time. There, he and his colleagues improved the software and released it as a product called Antiviral Toolkit Pro in 1992. At first the software was purchased by about ten clients per month. It earned about $100 per month, mostly from companies in Ukraine and Russia. Kaspersky's then-future wife Natalya Kaspersky became his coworker at KAMI.|$|E
5|$|After his <b>early</b> <b>release</b> {{from prison}} for {{political}} crimes in 1924, over {{the second half}} of the 1920s, Gandhi continued to pursue swaraj. He pushed through a resolution at the Calcutta Congress in December 1928 calling on the British government to grant India dominion status or face a new campaign of non-co-operation with complete independence for the country as its goal. After his support for the World War I with Indian combat troops, and the failure of Khilafat movement in preserving the rule of Caliph in Turkey, followed by a collapse in Muslim support for his leadership, some such as Subhas Chandra Bose and Bhagat Singh questioned his values and non-violent approach. While many Hindu leaders championed a demand for immediate independence, Gandhi revised his own call to a one-year wait, instead of two.|$|E
5|$|After the war, he {{was tried}} at Nuremberg {{and sentenced to}} 20 {{years in prison for}} his role in the Nazi regime, principally for the use of forced labor. Despite {{repeated}} attempts to gain <b>early</b> <b>release,</b> he served his full sentence, most of it at Spandau Prison in West Berlin. Following his release in 1966, Speer published two bestselling autobiographical works, Inside the Third Reich and , detailing his close personal relationship with Hitler, and providing readers and historians with a unique perspective on the workings of the Nazi regime. He later wrote a third book, Infiltration, about the SS. Speer died of a stroke in 1981 while on a visit to London.|$|E

5|$|Awake is an American {{television}} police procedural fantasy {{drama that}} originally aired on NBC for one season from March1 to May24, 2012. The pilot episode had an <b>early</b> <b>release</b> on Hulu on February16, 2012, {{two weeks before}} the series' premiere on television. The show's central character is Michael Britten (Jason Isaacs), a detective who works for the Los Angeles Police Department. Kyle Killen, the series' creator, was primarily responsible for the program's concept; although he served as a writer, he avowed that writing episode scripts was difficult. Killen also served as an executive producer (with David Slade) of the pilot episode. Jeffrey Reiner and Howard Gordon then continued producing (with Killen) for Gordon's Teakwood Lane Productions.|$|E
5|$|Citing {{the high}} costs and {{transportation}} logistics of proceeding while Vick was still in federal prison, state prosecutor Gerald Poindexter decided to postpone Vick's trial in Surry County Circuit Court until after Vick's release from federal custody. Vick's attorneys sought to resolve the state charges sooner. On October 14, 2008, Vick attorney Lawrence Woodward filed a motion to enter a plea via two-way electronic video with the Surry County Courts. Vick planned {{to plead guilty to}} state charges {{in an effort to get}} <b>early</b> <b>release</b> from federal prison and enter a halfway house. The request for a trial without Vick physically present was denied, but Poindexter agreed to hold the state trial while Vick was still in federal custody if Vick bore the costs of his transportation to Virginia and related expenses.|$|E
5|$|On April 20, 2011, it was {{reported}} that customers had launched a protest against perceived shortcomings of Portal 2. Users complained that the game was too shortsome saying that it is only four hours long, about the existence of paid, downloadable content for some versions at launch, and that the Windows and OS X versions were ports of the console version. Other journalists countered that the quality of the graphics on the Windows and Mac versions did not suggest a simple console port. Stephen Totilo of Kotaku wrote that the game lasted nine hours and that the downloadable content consisted purely of cosmetic add-ons. Some journalists said that the minimal impact of The Potato Sack alternative reality game on the <b>early</b> <b>release</b> of Portal 2 may be influencing the user scores.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers gave Empire: Total War {{universal}} acclaim; several critics commended {{it as one}} of {{the foremost}} strategy titles of recent times. Praise was bestowed upon the extensive strategic breadth, accurate historical challenges and visual effects. The real-time land battles, with a far greater focus on gunpowder weaponry than earlier Total War titles, were considered successful. Criticisms focused on shortcomings with the game's artificial intelligence and on the real-time naval battles being difficult to control and co-ordinate. The game was a commercial success, topping sales charts within a week of release; nevertheless, several Creative Assembly employees later commented on various issues caused by a perceived <b>early</b> <b>release.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Conservative {{government}} {{believed there}} was a need for it to act to prevent Sinn Féin from using the media to defend the actions of the IRA, and the measures were part of a wider government response to the increase in violence, which also included changes to the right to silence and the tightening of rules allowing paramilitary prisoners <b>early</b> <b>release.</b> Further controversy also erupted in September 1988 over an intended edition of the Channel 4 discussion programme After Dark which was to have featured the Sinn Féin president, Gerry Adams, as a guest. The show was dropped after the conservative academic Paul Wilkinson – a Professor at Aberdeen University who specialised in the study of terrorism and political violence – voiced strong objections to its transmission (more details here).|$|E

5|$|The {{prototype}} of the prison genre was The Big House (1930). In The Big House, Robert Montgomery plays a squirmy inmate who is sentenced to six years after committing vehicular manslaughter while under the influence. His cell mates are a murderer played by Wallace Beery and a forger played by Chester Morris. The picture features future staples of the prison genre such as solitary confinement, informers, riots, visitations, an escape, and the codes of prison life. The protagonist, Montgomery, ends up being a loathsome character, a coward who will sell anyone in the prison out to get an <b>early</b> <b>release.</b> The film was banned in Ohio, {{the site of the}} deadly prison riots that inspired it. Numbered Men, The Criminal Code, Shadow of the Law, Convict's Code, and others, from no less than seven studios, followed. However, prison films mainly appealed to men, and had weak box office performances as a result.|$|E
5|$|Three JNA officers, Mile Mrkšić; Veselin Šljivančanin; and Miroslav Radić, {{were indicted}} by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) on {{multiple}} counts {{of crimes against}} humanity and violations {{of the laws of}} war, having surrendered or been captured during 2002 and 2003. On 27 September 2007, Mrkšić was sentenced by the ICTY to 20 years' imprisonment for murder and torture, and Šljivančanin was sentenced to five years' imprisonment on charges of torture. Radić was acquitted. Šljivančanin's sentence was increased to 17 years on appeal, then reduced again to ten years after a second appeal, and he was granted <b>early</b> <b>release</b> in July 2011. Slavko Dokmanović, the Serb mayor of Vukovar, was also indicted and arrested {{for his role in the}} massacre, but committed suicide in June 1998, shortly before judgement was to be passed.|$|E
5|$|Hess {{continued}} {{to be interested in}} aviation, learning to fly the more advanced aircraft that were coming into development at the start of World War II. On 10 May 1941 he undertook a solo flight to Scotland, where he hoped to arrange peace talks with the Duke of Hamilton, whom he believed to be prominent in opposition to the British government. Hess was immediately arrested on his arrival and was held in British custody {{until the end of the}} war, when he was returned to Germany to stand trial in the Nuremberg Trials of major war criminals in 1946. During much of the trial, he claimed to be suffering from amnesia, but later admitted this was a ruse. Hess was convicted of crimes against peace and conspiracy with other German leaders to commit crimes and was transferred to Spandau Prison in 1947, where he served a life sentence. Repeated attempts by family members and prominent politicians to win him <b>early</b> <b>release</b> were blocked by the Soviet Union. Still in custody in Spandau, he died by suicide in 1987 at the age of 93. After his death the prison was demolished to prevent it from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine.|$|E
