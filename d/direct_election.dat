5|$|Before the {{university}} opened, the State Legislature amended Cornell's charter on April 24, 1867 to specify alumni elected trustees. However that provision {{did not become}} operative until {{there were at least}} 100 alumni in 1872. Cornell {{was one of the first}} Universities to elect trustees by <b>direct</b> <b>election.</b> (Harvard was probably the first to shift to <b>direct</b> <b>election</b> of its Board of Overseers by alumni in 1865.) Cornell's first female trustee was Martha Carey Thomas (class of 1877), who the alumni elected while she was serving as President of Bryn Mawr College.|$|E
5|$|By the 1890s, {{support for}} the {{introduction}} of <b>direct</b> <b>election</b> for the Senate had substantially increased, and reformers worked on two fronts. On the first front, the Populist Party incorporated the <b>direct</b> <b>election</b> of senators into its Omaha Platform, adopted in 1892. In 1908, Oregon passed the first law that based the selection of U.S. senators on a popular vote. Oregon was soon followed by Nebraska. Proponents for popular election noted that ten states already had non-binding primaries for Senate candidates, in which the candidates would be voted on by the public, effectively serving as advisory referenda instructing state legislatures how to vote; reformers campaigned for more states to introduce a similar method.|$|E

40|$|We study {{political}} business cycles (PBC) in newly democratized and decentralized Indonesia at {{the local}} level. As the timing of indirect and later on <b>direct</b> <b>elections</b> of district heads differs exogenously across jurisdictions, the political business cycle effect is clearly identified. Our data allow distinguishing PBCs for indirect and <b>direct</b> <b>elections.</b> We find significant budget cycles for discretionary budget categories {{at the disposal of}} the district head (not for the overall budget) only for <b>direct</b> <b>elections,</b> not for indirect elections. These cycles are much larger if the incumbent runs for reelection. Our results underline the conditional nature of PBC...|$|R

5|$|Heinrich {{also notes}} the {{possibility}} that national parliaments could appoint citizen representatives to the UNPA, similarly to how the U.S. Electoral College officially selects the President. This would be a stopgap solution until <b>direct</b> <b>election</b> became possible. Yet it would still ensure that citizens would be electing citizens (albeit indirectly), rather than the executive appointing officials, to the UNPA.|$|E

5|$|Another issue {{concerned}} {{the election of}} the president. Few agreed with Madison that the executive should be elected by the legislature. There was widespread concern with <b>direct</b> <b>election,</b> because information diffused so slowly in the late 18th century, and because of concerns that people would only vote for candidates from their state or region. A vocal minority wanted the national executive to be chosen by the governors of the states.|$|E

5|$|By 1912, 239 {{political}} parties {{at both the}} state and national level had pledged some form of <b>direct</b> <b>election,</b> and 33 states had introduced the use of direct primaries. Twenty-seven states had called for a constitutional convention on the subject, with 31 states needed to reach the threshold; Arizona and New Mexico each achieved statehood that year (bringing the total number of states to 48), and were expected to support the motion. Alabama and Wyoming, already states, had passed resolutions in favor of a convention without formally calling for one.|$|E

5|$|During its 2002 annual session, the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) added 14 {{amendments}} to the Constitution of Indonesia. Included in these amendments were measures to reorganize the legislature. Beginning in 2004, the MPR was composed of the existing People's Representative Council (DPR) and a new Regional Representative Council (DPD). Because all {{the seats in the}} MPR were directly elected, this called for removal of the military from the legislature, whose 38 seats in the Assembly were appointed. This change and an amendment for <b>direct</b> <b>election</b> of the President and Vice President were major steps for Indonesia on the road towards a full democracy.|$|E
5|$|Kagame {{had been}} de facto leader since 1994, but had {{focused more on}} military, foreign affairs and the country's {{security}} than day-to-day governance. By 2000, {{the threat posed by}} cross-border rebels was much reduced and when Bizimungu resigned, Kagame decided to seek the presidency himself. The transitional constitution was still in effect, which meant the president was elected by government ministers and the national assembly rather than by a <b>direct</b> <b>election.</b>|$|E
5|$|Republicans {{nominated}} Judge Edward C. O'Rear {{to oppose}} McCreary. There were few {{differences between the}} two men's stands on the issues. Both supported progressive reforms such as the <b>direct</b> <b>election</b> of senators, a non-partisan judiciary, {{and the creation of a}} public utilities commission. McCreary also changed his stance on the liquor question, now agreeing with Beckham's prohibitionist position; this also matched the Republican position. O'Rear claimed that Democrats should have already enacted the reforms their party platform advocated, but his only ready line of attack against McCreary himself was that he would be a pawn of Beckham and his allies.|$|E

5|$|Rowan {{identified}} with the Democratic-Republican Party and espoused the Jeffersonian principles of limited government and individual liberty. He was chosen to represent Nelson County at the constitutional convention held at Frankfort, Kentucky in 1799 to draft the second Kentucky Constitution. As a delegate, he advocated the supremacy of the legislative branch over the executive and judicial branches, which he believed provided ordinary citizens {{a greater role in}} state government. The constitution adopted by the convention abolished the use of electors to choose the governor and state senators, providing for the <b>direct</b> <b>election</b> of these officers instead.|$|E
5|$|After the election, Weaver {{returned}} to the lame-duck session of Congress and proposed an unsuccessful constitutional amendment that would have provided for the <b>direct</b> <b>election</b> of Senators. After his term expired in March, he resumed his speaking tour, promoting the Greenback Party across the nation. He and EdwardH. Gillette, another Iowa Greenback Congressman, bought the Iowa Tribune in 1882 to help spread the Greenback message. That same year, Weaver ran for his old 6th district seat in the House against the incumbent Republican, MarsenaE. Cutts. This time the Democrats and Greenbackers ran separate candidates, and Weaver finished a distant second. Cutts died before taking office, and the Republicans offered to let Weaver run unopposed in the special election if he rejoined their party; he declined, and JohnC. Cook, a Democrat, won the seat.|$|E
5|$|Alliance members {{gathered}} that December in Ocala, Florida, and formulated a platform, {{later called}} the Ocala Demands, {{that called for}} looser money, government control of the railroads, a graduated income tax, and the <b>direct</b> <b>election</b> of senators. Weaver endorsed the message in the Tribune and corresponded with the group's leader, LeonidasL. Polk. Weaver attended the group's convention in Cincinnati in May 1891, where he and Polk argued against forming a third party. Another delegate, IgnatiusL. Donnelly, argued forcefully for {{a break from the}} two major parties, and his argument carried the day, although Weaver and Polk kept many of Donnelly's more radical proposals out of the convention's statement of principles.|$|E

5|$|Steve Neal, McNary's biographer, {{describes}} McNary as {{a progressive}} who {{stuck with the}} Republican Party in 1910 even when many progressives left the party in favor of West, a Democrat. McNary backed the Progressive Era reforms (the initiative, recall, referendum, primary elections, and the <b>direct</b> <b>election</b> of US senators) of Oregonian William Simon U'Ren, {{and he was an}} early supporter of public, rather than private, power companies. After West won the election, he chose McNary to be special legal counsel to Oregon's railroad commission, who urged lower passenger and freight rates. Meanwhile, McNary maintained friendly relations with both progressive and conservative factions of the Oregon Republicans and with West.|$|E
5|$|Besides the {{problems}} of <b>direct</b> <b>election,</b> the new Constitution was seen as such a radical break with the old system, by which delegates were elected to the Confederation Congress by state legislatures, that the Convention agreed to retain this method of electing senators to make the constitutional change less radical. The more difficult problem was the issue of apportionment. The Connecticut delegation offered a compromise, whereby the number of representatives for each state in the lower house would be apportioned based on the relative size of the state's population, {{while the number of}} representatives in the upper house would be the same for all of the states, irrespective of size. The large states, fearing a diminution of their influence in the legislature under this plan, opposed this proposal. Unable to reach agreement, the delegates decided to leave this issue for further consideration later during the meeting.|$|E
