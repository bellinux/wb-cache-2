500|$|In 2012, Cruz {{appeared}} in the first ever Nintendo commercial to promote New Super Mario Bros. 2 and the Nintendo 3DS XL in which she {{played the role of}} Mario in the ad. She spoke Italian again, this time in Woody Allen's romantic ensemble comedy film To Rome with Love, in which she portrayed a street-smart prostitute who agrees to pretend to be the wife of a newlywed. <b>Fond</b> <b>to</b> work with her again, Allen compared Cruz's play in the film with that of Italian icons Anna Magnani and Sophia Loren. While the film garnered mixed reviews in general, Cruz received favourable reviews for her [...] "exuberantly, cartoonishly sexy" [...] performance, which reviewers such as The Week cited as a stand out. The same year, Cruz also reunited with Italian director Sergio Castellitto in his war tale Twice Born about an infertile Italian woman who returns to relive her past in Sarajevo. An adaptation of Castellitto's wife Margaret Mazzantini's same-titled bestseller, Cruz portrayed the transitional character at different phases in her life, ranging from her early twenties to her late forties. Despite receiving little praise from critics, Cruz's performance opposite Emile Hirsch earned positive reviews.|$|E

Little and less he says to them, So dances his heart in his breast; Their {{tranquil}} mien bereaveth him Of wit, of words, of rest. Too weak to win, too <b>fond</b> <b>to</b> shun The tyrants of his doom, The much deceived Endymion Slips behind a tomb.|$|E

6000|$|It is {{said the}} world is governed by opinion; and {{politicians}} assure us, that all power is founded thereupon. Wherefore, as all human creatures are <b>fond</b> <b>to</b> distraction of their own opinions; and so much the more, as those opinions are absurd, ridiculous, or of little moment; it must follow, that they are equally fond of power. But no opinions are maintained with so much obstinacy as those in religion, especially by such zealots who never bore the least regard to religion, conscience, honour, justice, truth, mercy, or common morality, farther than in outward appearance; under the mask of hypocrisy, to promote their diabolical designs. And therefore Bishop Burnet, one of their oracles, tells us honestly, that the saints of those fanatic times, pronounced themselves above morality; which they reckoned among [...] "beggarly elements"; but the meaning of those two last words thus applied, we confess to be above our understanding.|$|E
