This acknowledgment strategy allows the TCP source to distinguish between losses due to congestion and losses due to corruption.

Without this distinction, TCP throughput is shown to suffer significantly over a path with a large bandwidth-delay product.

The results obtained show that the proposed shooting method based algorithm achieves much faster convergence rate at the expense of a moderate increase in the calculation time.

40|$|Thermoelastic stress {{analysis}} (TSA) {{is a well}} established tool for non-destructive full-field experimental {{stress analysis}}. In TSA {{the change in the}} sum of the principal stresses is derived, usually when a component is subjected to a cyclic load. Therefore the mean stress or any residual stress in a component cannot be obtained from the thermoelastic response. However, modifications to the linear form of the thermoelastic equation that incorporate the mean stress may provide a means of establishing the residual stresses. It has also been shown that the application of plastic strain modifies the thermoelastic constant in some materials, causing a change in thermoelastic response, which may also be related to the residual stress. The changes in response due to plastic strain and mean stress are of the order of a few mK and are significantly less than those expected to be resolved in standard TSA. Recent developments in <b>infra-red</b> detector <b>technology</b> have enabled these small variations in the thermoelastic response to be identified, leading to renewed interest in the use of TSA for residual stress analysis in realistic components. The component studied in this work is an aluminium plate that contains a cold expanded hole, hence providing an opportunity to examine any changes in thermoelastic response caused by the residual stress in the neighbourhood of the hole. The variations in thermoelastic response due to residual stress are shown to be measurable and significant; validation of the residual stress field is provided by laboratory X-ray diffraction. The potential for a TSA based approach for residual stress analysis is revisited, and the feasibility of applying it to components containing realistic residual stress levels is assessed...|$|R

This paper describes a new technique for the monitoring and automated control of the reflow soldering process. The new technique combines state of the art <b>infra-red</b> (IR) sensor <b>technology,</b> coupled with application specific process control software, to provide a unique capability to both monitor actual product temperatures during the soldering process and to use this information to modify the process settings. The development of techniques to allow rapid variation of the heat transfer from the oven to the in-process Printed Circuit Assemblies (PCAs) allows the system to automatically adjust the soldering oven's process settings for each individual PCA passing through it. This product-by-product profiling facilitates the assurance of consistent thermal histories and also allows the oven to optimise its energy consumption to the demands of each product. Archiving of the reflow temperature profiles also provides full traceability to the reflow process. The incorporation of IR sensing technology also aids in determining/verifying the oven profile at the introduction of new PCA designs.

40|$|The book on hand {{provides}} {{a method for}} evaluating different thermal passive improvements on the vehicle cabin. A thermal cabin simulation model in Modelica is developed, based on the RWTH Aachen Modelica Library “AixLib”. The model respects the cabin geometry, material properties and Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning is regulated by a simple PI-controller to the interior temperature. Models for surrounding conditions like weather, driving cycle or solar radiation are implemented. Main output-value is the power-consumption of the HVAC-model and the interior temperature. The whole model is validated against measurements on a real test vehicle in a climate dynamometer chamber. Within {{the development of the}} cabin-model the glass-curvature is one parameter that normally is not respected with thermal cabin simulation. Since there was no possibility to get the influence of the glass curvature for passenger car thermal cabin simulation models this parameter is evaluated in detail. Based on the known radiation properties of flat glass, a new method for calculating transmission through curved glass is developed respecting influences due to changing ray-progress in the glass and the effects of the wider projected area of curved windows. An analysis of this effects leads to a prioritization based on effect-size and all relevant influences are summarized in a set of curves. The major effort for calculating this set of curves leads to a simplification process that brings a formula depending on a normed curvature radius and the incident angle. This formula is further developed to a method for calculating the influence of curvature on radiation transmission in 3 D-simulations. To evaluate the impact of the glass curvature on transmission for passenger cars, curved building facades and roofs three exemplary simulations are done, respecting the position of the sun during a whole day. The simulations indicate, that glass curvature can be neglected for normal passenger cars. For curved building facades and roofs the simulation gives evidence that glass curvature can't be ignored. The developed model is an adequate method for respecting this influence in an early state of thermal building simulation. Corresponding to the objective of this work a sensitivity analysis is performed with the developed thermal cabin simulation model. For this analysis three parameters are identified for variation: Thermal insulation of the cabin, thermal mass and solar transmission. These parameters are evaluated in three different environment conditions (warm, moderate and cold temperature). The analysis determines the solar transmission as the major parameter. Therefore window concepts with glass technologies to affect solar radiation are developed for a passenger car. These concepts are implemented and simulated in the thermal cabin simulation. The results show a significant benefit of <b>infra-red</b> reflecting <b>technologies.</b> Although switchable glass is not yet ready for the use in passenger cars due to performance issues and optical properties the thermal benefit is proven by the results...|$|R
40|$|The {{high degree}} of {{environmental}} heterogeneity present in Australia has resulted in species possessing specific traits that ensure their survival, one such trait is a {{high degree of}} mobility. Some species will migrate or travel long distances in order to track seasonally available resources. This makes the monitoring of mobile species difficult and as climate change continues to affect the timing and availability of these resources, understanding the response of these species is more important than ever. Here I use flying-foxes (Pteropus spp.) as a study group as they are highly mobile, the influence of climate change on their distribution is yet to be investigated, they have complex management issues and they are widely distributed across coastal Australia. I identify methods of monitoring highly mobile flying-foxes on a variety of spatial and temporal scales. I then apply the ecological information collected to a specific management issue: bat strikes in the aviation industry. I develop a new method of monitoring flying-foxes at camps that are difficult to access: aerial photography. This technique produces results comparable to traditional census methods, and the remote capture allows access to information on camps that were impossible to access before. My results from North Queensland show that camp use is highly variable and that patterns shown at a regional level are not necessarily reflected at all camps. This technique can be applied across large areas and could be the key to a national monitoring strategy for Australian flying-foxes. I then develop climate models for all four Australian mainland flying-foxes on a national scale and find that parameters associated with precipitation are the single most important climatic factor contributing to flying-fox camp location. This could be due to the importance of precipitation for the fruiting and flowering phenology of flying-fox food trees. When modeling the changes in climatic space for these four species with global climate data from 2030, 2050 and 2070. I find that three species (Pteropus alecto, P. conspicillatus and P. scapulatus) should experience an increase in mean area and abundance at each time slice and that one species shows a decrease (P. poliocephalus). With variable future projections for precipitation in future global climate models and the absence of finer scale data, this should be interpreted with caution. Changes in distribution have been identified for all four species already and a camp has been located that now contains all four species, when previously only two were known to co-roost at this location. The climate at this location is suitable for the two newly recorded species but marginally so for one (P. conspicillatus). Evidence suggests that P. poliocephalus has historically occurred at this location but that P. conspicillatus has more recently occurred in this region, possibly as a result of climate change. To explore the ecological factors influencing behaviour at a local scale, emergence timing at a flying-fox camp in tropical North Queensland was investigated. This also allowed me to determine if the factors influencing emergence timing in the tropics differed from other areas. I found that a linear relationship with the time of civil twilight explains most of the variation in emergence time, but that significant effects of weather, month and year also exist. Many of these factors also related to light levels, with cloud cover and heavy rainfall, delaying emergence. There was also a possible influence from increased anthropogenic lighting over the seven years of the study as I found that yearly variation in emergence time is correlated with increased activity from a nearby port, possibly reflecting increased light pollution. On a monthly basis, emergence timing was influenced by seasonal variation in roost occupancy, suggesting that foraging competition may also influence this behaviour. At a finer scale again, I investigated roost tree usage within camps and found high variability on a variety of time scales with seasonal changes in abundance overlain on highly variable day-to-day patterns of roost use. To apply this information to a current management problem, I next investigate flying-fox movements and strikes at a local airport and on a national scale. To identify movement patterns at an airport, I develop motion-detecting <b>infra-red</b> camera <b>technology</b> to detect nocturnal wildlife movements. I found that flying-foxes dominate the nocturnal wildlife activity at this airport and that there are seasonal peaks of activity in the periods preceding and following the wet season. These peaks of activity correspond with flowering peaks of food trees in the region and a nightly peak of activity after sunset corresponded with the emergence time of flying-foxes in the region. Flying-foxes and birds had opposing directional movements with flying-foxes moving toward the urban centre in the evening whilst diurnally active birds were leaving the area. The pattern reversed in the morning when flying-foxes returned to the camp. This {{can be explained by the}} different activity patterns of these groups with both going to forage at different times. Infra-red cameras can provide an efficient and inexpensive monitoring tool for aviation managers and the similarity of local studies to national patterns provides evidence that nocturnal monitoring of wildlife can provide an excellent mitigation strategy. Data on a national scale showed that flying-fox strikes are increasing, are greatest in tropical regions, and are more likely during early evening and while an aircraft is landing rather than departing. These studies show that movements and patterns of aircraft strike differ for flying-foxes and birds and highlight the importance of taxon-specific studies. I have shown that good baseline ecological data from a variety of spatial and temporal scales can provide important information for the management of flying-foxes at a local airport. I have also provided an overview of many monitoring methods that can be translated to other regions and to other highly mobile species...|$|R
