25|$|Among <b>dizygotic</b> <b>twins,</b> in rare cases, {{the eggs}} are fertilized at {{different}} times with two or more acts of sexual intercourse, either within one menstrual cycle (superfecundation) or, even more rarely, {{later on in the}} pregnancy (superfetation). This can lead to the possibility of a woman carrying fraternal twins with different fathers (that is, half-siblings). This phenomenon is known as heteropaternal superfecundation. One 1992 study estimates that the frequency of heteropaternal superfecundation among <b>dizygotic</b> <b>twins,</b> whose parents were involved in paternity suits, was approximately 2.4%; see the references section, below, for more details.|$|E

With respect to the dominance pattern of coronary blood supply, two of three monozygotic twin pairs differed, while all <b>dizygotic</b> <b>twin</b> pairs were concordant. Concordant and discordant locations of stenoses were found with similar frequency in monozygotic and <b>dizygotic</b> <b>twin</b> pairs.  CONCLUSIONS—The dominance pattern of coronary blood supply and the location of coronary lesions are not strictly hereditary. The high concordance of premature coronary artery disease found in monozygotic twin pairs may largely be related to factors that are independent of the macroanatomic distribution of the coronary blood supply.    Keywords: twin studies; coronary anatomy; coronary lesion...|$|R

The hypothesis itself was based upon the disease-discordance and sex-concordance characteristics of twin pairs affected with anencephalus, and upon the sex ratio of the disease itself. The testable predictions of the hypothesis are (a) that variations {{in the incidence of}} anencephalus should be related to variations in <b>dizygotic</b> <b>twinning</b> rates, and particularly that <b>dizygotic</b> <b>twinning</b> rates will set upper limits to the incidence of anencephalus, and (b) that the F/M ratio in anencephalic infants will be high in circumstances of high incidence, and specifically when the incidence is high in relation to the <b>dizygotic</b> <b>twinning</b> rate. Examples from international comparisons, secular changes, social class gradients, and variations according to maternal age confirm a consistent correspondence between observations and these predictions. In addition, the possibility was tested that some fetus-fetus interactions might be based upon sequential rather than simultaneous pairs of fetuses. This model predicted asymmetries of sex ratio in sibs immediately preceding propositi, with differences according to the sex of the affected child, and the predicted findings were confirmed. The fetus-fetus interaction hypothesis is therefore extended in the terms that about one third of occurrences are determined in a sequential manner...|$|R

40|$|A central {{problem in}} {{research}} on twins is the estimation of the rates of monozygotic and <b>dizygotic</b> <b>twin</b> maternities. The estimation usually follows Weinberg’s differential rule. According to this rule, the rate of <b>dizygotic</b> <b>twinning</b> is {{twice the rate of}} twin maternities in which the twins are of opposite sex. The monozygotic twinning rate is the difference between the rates of same-sex and opposite-sex twin sets. Weinberg’s differential rule is implicitly based on the assumptions that the probability of a male equals the probability of a female and that the sexes in a <b>dizygotic</b> <b>twin</b> set are independent. Although Weinberg’s differential rule has been the target of continuing discussions, the reliability of these assumptions has never been conclusively verified or rejected. In this study we present new variance formulas for the monozygotic and <b>dizygotic</b> <b>twinning</b> rates obtained using Weinberg’s differential rule and stress that these new formulas have to be used. We analyze the accuracy of Weinberg’s differential rule by considering alternative attempts. Especially, we build a general likelihood function and show that the maximum- likelihood estimates differ only slightly from the rates obtained using Weinberg’s differential rule. In addition, our methods are applied to twinning data from Finland and Sweden. We compare our results with findings in the literature. In conclusion, our findings indicate that Weinberg’s differential rule is rather robust and that despite its simplicity, it gives reliable results when official birth registers are analyzed...|$|R

The present study aimed to investigate whether features of body composition, such as maternal height, weight and body mass index (BMI) are associated with an increased chance of <b>dizygotic</b> <b>twinning</b> after IVF with double embryo transfer (DET). This study was conducted using data from a large Dutch nationwide cohort that comprised 19 861 women who had IVF or ICSI treatment between 1983 and 1995 (OMEGA study). First ofresh' IVF and ICSI cycles with DET resulting in a delivery of a singleton or twin (living as well as stillborn) were selected. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed, with the delivery of a singleton or twin as the dependent variable and height, weight, BMI, maternal age, number of retrieved oocytes, use of alcohol, smoking, highest level of education and parity as independent variables. Of the 6598 women who completed their first IVF or ICSI cycle, 2375 had DET, resulting in 496 deliveries of 371 singletons and 125 twins.

25|$|Twin studies, {{adoption}} studies, {{and artificial}} selection {{studies have shown}} that a person's genes can predispose them to developing alcoholism.

Reasons for gender differences may be due to environmental factors, such as negative public attitudes towards female drinkers.

25|$|The {{ability to}} {{recognize}} incorrect pitch (musical) is most often tested by using the Distorted Tunes Test (DTT). The DTT was originally developed in the 1940s and was used in large studies in the British population. The DTT measures musical pitch recognition ability on an ordinal scale, scored {{as the number of}} correctly classified tunes. More specifically the DTT is used to evaluate subjects on how well they judge whether simple popular melodies contain notes with incorrect pitch. Researchers have used this method to investigate genetic correlates of musical pitch recognition in both monozygotic and <b>dizygotic</b> <b>twins.</b> Drayna, Manichaikul, Lange, Snieder and Spector (2001) determined that the variation in musical pitch recognition is primarily due to highly heritable differences in auditory functions not tested by conventional audiologic methods. Therefore, the DTT method may provide a benefit to advancing research studies similar to this one.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the major}} finding of a genetic defect being {{responsible}} for the Parkinson's disease (PD) phenotype in some kindreds with dominantly transmitted PD, the role of inheritance {{in the cause of}} the more widespread sporadic form of the disease is still unclear. Twin studies are a classic tool for assessing the influence of hereditary factors in diseases; however, the application of this approach to late-onset illnesses, like PD, poses some problems because of the identification of subclinical cases. In the present longitudinal study we have used [18 F]dopa and positron emission tomography to study dopaminergic function in twin pairs at baseline clinically discordant for PD. At baseline, the concordance for subclinical striatal dopaminergic dysfunction was found to be significantly higher in 18 monozygotic than in 16 <b>dizygotic</b> <b>twin</b> pairs (55 % vs 18 %, respectively). The asymptomatic monozygotic cotwins all showed progressive loss of dopaminergic function over 7 years and 4 developed clinical PD.

25|$|Sibling’s {{influence}} is often {{most effective when}} the sibling is of an age that is more advanced than the child himself, therefore increasing the motivation {{for the child to}} model after their brother or sister. The impact of older siblings are power predictors for the younger sibling’s gender role attitudes, sex-typed personality qualities, and masculine leisure activities. Findings suggest that girls develop less traditional attitudes than boys, thus, relative to stereotypically traditional development, older male siblings are more conscientious towards masculine activities, which are evidently modeled after by younger siblings more than feminine activities. Moreover, older brothers tend to have stronger influence over a younger sibling’s sexual development. There is evidence that the relationship between older brother and younger sister can, in fact, influence the sister to become more feminine, abiding to more stereotypical gender-typed development than girls with older sisters. Interestingly, biological studies show that <b>dizygotic</b> <b>twins</b> with the opposite- sex co-twin gender show more sex-typed behaviors than same-sex twins.|$|E
