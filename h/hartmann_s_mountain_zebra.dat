50|$|The Cape <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> {{is one of}} two {{geographically}} separated subspecies of {{the species}} Equus <b>zebra</b> (<b>mountain</b> <b>zebra),</b> the other being Hartmann's <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> (Equus <b>zebra</b> hartmannae).The Cape <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> was once was regarded as a separate species from Hartmann's <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> based on taxonomic evidence, but recent genomic evidence has led to the two populations now being reclassified as subspecies of Equus zebra.|$|R
50|$|However, in {{a sexual}} genetic study that {{included}} 295 <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> specimens, Moodley and Harley (2005) found nothing to support {{the separation of the}} two <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> populations into separate species. They concluded that the Cape <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> and Hartmann's <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> should remain as subspecies.|$|R
50|$|Groves and Bell {{found that}} the Cape <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> {{exhibits}} sexual dimorphism, females being larger than males, whereas in Hartmann's <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> they are not. Hartmann's zebra is on average slightly larger than the Cape <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra.</b>|$|R
40|$|Resource use of Cape <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> was {{studied in}} the Baviaanskloof Nature Reserve (BNR) over {{concerns}} of the poor performance in population growth. We assessed the seasonal diet, habitat suitability and forage quality of the Bergplaas area in BNR for <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra.</b> Grasses contributed 95. 2 % to the annual diet of <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra,</b> Tristachya leucothrix contributing the most (39. 4 %), followed by Themeda triandra (27. 6 %). Seasonally, T. triandra contributed most to the diet in winter, while T. leucothrix became {{more important in the}} summer and also was the only species preferred in all seasons. <b>Mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> concentrated their feeding in Kouga Grassy Fynbos and from our assessment this was the only habitat suitable for <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra.</b> Our analysis of <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> dung indicated that the seasonal nitrogen and phosphorus content was below the threshold values prescribed for grazers, and our study suggests that <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> at Bergplaas are severely resource limited. We emphasize the importance of fire and access to nutrient-rich lowlands in influencing the nutritional ecology of <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> and provide conservation management recommendations.

50|$|The Hartmann's <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> (Equus zebra hartmannae) is a {{subspecies}} of the <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> {{found in}} far south-western Angola and western Namibia.Hartmann's <b>mountain</b> <b>zebras</b> prefer {{to live in}} small groups of 7-12 individuals. They are agile climbers {{and are able to}} live in arid conditions and steep mountainous country.|$|R
50|$|Historically, the Cape <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> {{occurred}} {{throughout the}} montane {{regions of the}} Cape Province of South Africa. Today they are confined to several mountain reserves and national parks: mainly the <b>Mountain</b> <b>Zebra</b> National Park, but also the Gamka Mountain Reserve and Karoo National Park, amongst many others.As its name implies, like all <b>mountain</b> <b>zebras,</b> the Cape <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> is found on slopes and plateaus of mountainous regions, {{and can be found}} at up to 2000m above sea level in the summer, moving to lover elevations in the winter.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, C. P. Groves and C. H. Bell {{investigated}} the taxonomy of the zebras (genus Equus, subgenus Hippotigris). They {{concluded that the}} [...] <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> (Equus zebra <b>zebra)</b> and Hartmann's <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> (Equus zebra hartmannea) are distinct, and suggested that the two would be better classified as separate species, Equus zebra and Equus hartmannae.|$|R
50|$|<b>Mountain</b> <b>Zebra</b> National Park is a {{national}} park in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa proclaimed in July 1937 {{for the purpose of}} providing a nature reserve for the endangered Cape <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> has a dewlap, {{which is}} more {{conspicuous}} in Equus zebra zebra than in Equus zebra hartmannae. Like all extant <b>zebras,</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>zebras</b> are boldly striped in black or dark brown and no two individuals look exactly alike. The whole body is striped except for the belly. In the Cape <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra,</b> the ground colour is effectively white, but the ground colour in Hartmann's zebra is slightly buff.|$|R
50|$|Hartmann's <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> (Equus zebra hartmannae Matschie, 1898) {{is named}} in his honor. It is a {{subspecies}} of the <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> native to south-western Angola, Namibia and South Africa. Hartmann Valley in the Kaokoveld is also named after him.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} argued that Hartmann's <b>mountain</b> <b>zebras</b> should be {{considered}} a separate species from the Cape <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra,</b> but this is not supported by genetic evidence (see Mountain zebra#Taxonomy). Consequently, it is no longer considered a subspecies in Mammal Species of the World. 2005.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, South African {{conservation}} {{officials have}} noted the appearance of sarcoid tumour-like growths in Cape <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> (Equus zebra zebra) populations. In domestic horses (Equus ferus caballus), a genetic predisposition for this bovine papillomavirusinduced tumour is reported. This investigation compared population genetic parameters within tumour-affected populations in Bontebok National Park and Gariep Dam Nature Reserve against Cape <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> populations having few or no tumours in Karoo National Park and Karoo Nature Reserve in South Africa and Hartmann’s <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> populations from Namibia. Tumour-affected populations had the lowest levels of expected heterozygosity, gene diversity and polymorphism and highest values of internal relatedness and homozygosity by loci but not reaching levels of significance (P = 0. 05). Wright’s FIS values indicated an overall deficit of heterozygotes in both affected and non-affected Cape <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> populations. Considerable population substructuring, as indicated by FST values and Bayesian clustering, was revealed among all Cape <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> populations. The results provide support for current conservation policies aimed at increasing levels of genetic diversity in isolated Cape <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> populations. The Faculty of Veterinary Science of University of Pretoria, Equine Research Center and the Veterinary Wildlife Unit provided funding for the project.

25|$|There is {{a dispute}} among {{biologists}} {{as to how}} to properly classify the various species of zebra. It is thought that the plains <b>zebra</b> and <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> belong to the subgenus Hippotigris and that Grévy's zebra is the sole species of subgenus Dolichohippus. This is on account of Grévy's zebra resembling an ass (subgenus Asinus), while the plains <b>zebra</b> and <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> are more horse-like. All three animals belong to the genus Equus along with other living equids. However, recent phylogenetic evidence finds that plains zebras are more closely related to Grévy's <b>zebras</b> than <b>mountain</b> <b>zebras.</b> In areas where plains zebras are sympatric with Grévy's zebras, it is not unusual to find them in the same herds and fertile hybrids occur. In captivity, plains zebras have been crossed with <b>mountain</b> <b>zebras.</b> The hybrid foals lacked a dewlap and resembled the plains zebra apart from their larger ears and their hindquarters pattern.|$|R
50|$|The Cape <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> and the Hartmann's <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> are now allopatric, {{meaning that}} their present ranges do not overlap, which {{prevents}} them from crossbreeding. This was not always so, and the current situation {{is a result of}} their population being fragmented when hunters exterminated them throughout the Northern Cape Province of South Africa. Historically, <b>mountain</b> <b>zebras</b> could be found across {{the entire length of the}} escarpments along the west coast of southern Africa and in the fold mountain region in the south. However, they generally inhabited poorly productive land and were nowhere really numerous in comparison to those species of zebras or antelope that inhabited the plains, for example.|$|R

50|$|A year later, in {{response}} to the continued decline, the government established the <b>Mountain</b> <b>Zebra</b> National Park on Acacia veld near Cradock, South Africa, but its small population of Cape <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> died out in 1950. That same year reintroductions from nearby remnant populations began.Eleven animals were donated from a nearby farm in 1950, and in 1964 another small herd was added. By the late 1960s, the total Cape mountain population was only 140 but grew to 200 by 1979, with 75% of the animals residing in <b>Mountain</b> <b>Zebra</b> National Park. In 1984, the population was back to 400 head. Since then a few zebras have been reintroduced to the Cape Point Section of Table Mountain National Park.|$|R
50|$|The <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> {{occurred}} in the mountain regions of the Cape Fold Belt, and along the southern portion of the Great Escarpment. Thus, they were endemic to, amongst others, the western Lower Karoo, and the Little Karoo. However, they were hunted to near extinction, leaving fewer than 100 individuals by the 1930s. Conservation efforts since then brought their numbers up to 1200 by 1998, mainly by concentrating these zebra in nature reserves and protected areas, the most well known of these being the <b>Mountain</b> <b>Zebra</b> National Park near Cradock in the Great Karoo. Cape <b>Mountain</b> <b>Zebras</b> are still found in protected areas managed by Cape Nature, including the Kamanassie and Gamkaberg Nature Reserves.|$|R

The <b>mountain</b> <b>zebra</b> population of the park comprised only five stallions and one mare and was insufficient to expand the population. By 1950 only two stallions remained, and a neighboring farmer, Mr H L Lombard, improved the breeding pool by donating eleven zebra to the park.|$|R

Because of the rarity of the species and the undesirable concentration of the majority in an area of only 6 536 ha, a post-mortem examination is performed, if possible, on all animals to establish cause of death with the purpose of preventing large-scale mortalities. This is done even if the carcass is in a fairly advanced state of decomposition.
