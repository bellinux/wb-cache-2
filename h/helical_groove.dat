For the elastically supported cylinder, the Reynolds number varied from 1. 3 x 104 to 4. 6 x 104, whilst for the fixed cylinder from 3. 1 x 104 to 3. 75 x 105. A comparative approach which allows direct comparisons of the results was adopted where two cylinders of identical dimensions and physical properties with or without <b>helical</b> surface <b>grooves</b> were tested in exactly same experimental set-ups. In the elastically supported cylinder tests, the cylinders were attached to a vertically cantilevered supporting rod and towed in a towing tank. Both the in-line and cross-flow vibrations were permitted. In the fixed cylinder tests, the cylinders were supported on rigid vertical struts and towed horizontally in the same towing tank. It is found that for the case investigated the <b>helical</b> <b>grooves</b> were effective in suppressing the vortex-induced cross-flow vibration amplitudes with the peak amplitude reduced by 64 %.

5000|$|The Dictabelt, {{in early}} years {{and much less}} {{commonly}} also called a Memobelt, is an analog audio recording medium commercially introduced by the American Dictaphone company in 1947.

In the present study de-ionized water flow in the plain thermo-syphon, Sintered Copper wick and <b>Helical</b> <b>grooved</b> heat pipes with simultaneous evaporation, adiabatic and condensation phenomenon are studied using Heat pipe test equipment. In this equipment a heat pipe subjected to a predetermine heat load by a resistance heater at its evaporator end and water jacket with controlled flow of water is employed to dissipate the heat energy at the condenser end. All the temperatures are measured and the required calculations are carried out to get percentage efficiencies at varying flow rates and heat inputs. The performance of heat pipes and comparison between their efficiencies is done. The sintered copper wick structure pipe have been found efficient {{when compared to other}} two with heat inputs starting from 50 to 200 watts because of predominating Capillarity property. Even the <b>helical</b> <b>grooved</b> heat pipe can also be used efficiently at the lower flow rates for power input ranging from 100 to 200 W. Whereas, the plain thermo-syphon has lower efficiency and also the relative difference between the evaporator and condenser temperature is also very high which makes it in-effective. The variations of evaporator and condenser surface temperatures are plotted for changing heat inputs and flow rate changes at condenser water jacket.

5000|$|Flutes / teeth: The flutes of {{the milling}} bit are the deep <b>helical</b> <b>grooves</b> {{running up the}} cutter, while the sharp blade {{along the edge of}} the flute is known as the tooth.

There is almost always one tooth per flute, but some cutters have two teeth per flute. Often, the words flute and tooth are used interchangeably. Milling cutters may have from one to many teeth, with 2, 3 and 4 being most common. Typically, the more teeth a cutter has, the more rapidly it can remove material.

50|$|In the {{territory}} of Kentucky, {{one of the most}} early successful rifles, the long rifle, was developed {{over the course of the}} 18th century. Compared to the more common Brown Bess, they had a tighter bore, no room between bullet and barrel, still used balls instead of conical bullets, but the balls were smaller, allowing the production of more rounds for a given amount of lead. They also had longer barrels, allowing more accuracy, and of course were rifled with a <b>helical</b> <b>groove.</b> These first started appearing sometime before 1740, one early examples being made by Jacob Dickert, a German immigrant. By 1850 there were a number of such manufacturers in the area. The longer barrel was a departure by local gunsmiths from their German roots, allowing frontiersmen to carry more rounds and for bullets to achieve a higher speed (as the burning gunpowder was contained longer) before emerging from the barrel.|$|E
5000|$|A rifle is {{a firearm}} {{designed}} to be fired from the shoulder, with a barrel that has a <b>helical</b> <b>groove</b> or pattern of grooves ("rifling") cut into the barrel walls. The raised areas of the rifling are called [...] "lands," [...] which {{make contact with the}} projectile (for small arms usage, called a bullet), imparting spin around an axis corresponding to the orientation of the weapon. When the projectile leaves the barrel, this spin lends gyroscopic stability to the projectile and prevents tumbling, {{in the same way that}} a properly thrown American football or rugby ball behaves. This allows the use of aerodynamically-efficient bullets (as opposed to the spherical balls used in muskets) and thus improves range and accuracy. The word [...] "rifle" [...] originally referred to the grooving, and a rifle was called a [...] "rifled gun."

50|$|Ever {{since the}} {{development}} of wire rope, comprising multiple wire strands, spooling the wire has presented technical challenges. When wrapped in multiple layers, the upper layers {{have a tendency to}} crush the lower layers, while the lower layers have a tendency to pinch upper layers. The rubbing of rope against rope also has a tendency to cause wear.These problems were addressed by Frank L. LeBus Sr., a supplier of drilling equipment to the oilfields of Texas, USA, who in 1937, patented the use of a groove bar on hoisting drums to guide the spooling of rope. Grooved shape steel segments were simply welded or screwed to existing plain steel drums. Ever since then, drum groovings have been widely used to guide the spooling of wire rope onto and off winch drums.Introducing a continuous <b>helical</b> <b>groove</b> onto the drum, like the thread of a screw, provides a way to guide the rope when spooling onto or off a drum. However this has been shown to work effectively only when the rope is wrapped in a single layer. When the rope is wrapped in multiple layers, problems remain.Frank LeBus introduced a grooving pattern that put the groove parallel to the flanges of the drum, except for a single slanted section across the drum face to act as crossover point, moving the rope along by the width of the groove with every revolution.|$|E

In addition to the knife bayonet introduced with the previous rifles, Mondragón designed a spade bayonet for use with the Modelo 1908, for which he filed a patent application (No. 631,283) on June 6, 1911.|$|R
5000|$|Gradually, rifles {{appeared}} with cylindrical barrels cut with <b>helical</b> <b>grooves,</b> the surfaces between the grooves being [...] "lands". The innovation shortly preceded the mass adoption of breech-loading weapons, {{as it was}} not practical to push an overbore bullet down through a rifled barrel, only to then (try to) fire it back out. The dirt and grime from prior shots was pushed down ahead of a tight bullet or ball (which {{may have been a}} loose fit in the clean barrel before the first shot), and, of course, loading was far more difficult, as the lead had to be deformed to go down in the first place, reducing the accuracy due to deformation. Several systems were tried to deal with the problem, usually by resorting to an under-bore bullet that expanded upon firing.|$|R
5000|$|A declassified US {{analysis}} of the feed system, based on models captured during the Korean War, reads: An interesting departure was made from the heretofore orthodox practice of feeding ammunition to a gun of this caliber. The feed, somewhat resembling a grooved revolver cylinder, {{is an integral part}} of the gun, and the cartridges remain axial throughout the entire operation.The cylindrical feed cage is rotated by an arm that engages a slot in the gas piston. A <b>helical</b> <b>groove</b> in the drum arrangement withdraws the cartridges from the metal disintegrating link belt as it moves through the feedway by engaging their rims and gradually camming the cartridges rearward. The freed cartridges are then presented at the bottom of the receiver for chambering by final rotation.This circular type of feed holds ten rounds. Several phases are required to completely delink a round and roll it up into position for being shoved into the chamber. A small folding handle held on the top side is used to rotate the feed drum when filling with cartridges.Camming the round slowly out of the belt with this type of feeder causes practically no drag when the weapon is fired at high speed. It has belt pull enough to take care of practically any length belt desired. ...The Russian Air Force nicknamed this circular arrangement the [...] "bird-cage" [...] feed.
