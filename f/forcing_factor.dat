The match also {{included}} his father as well as Pirata Morgan, Jr., Barba Roja, Bestia 666, Damián 666, Dr. Wagner, Jr., Halloween, El Hijo del Perro Aguayo, Monster Clown, Murder Clown and Psycho Clown. The match came down to Hijo de Pirata and his father as the last two men in the ring. Which led to Pirata Morgan allowing his son to keep his mask, electing to have his hair shaved off instead. Los Piratas tag team championship reign came to an end after 490 days, when Negro Navaro and Trauma I (collectively known as La Dinastia Muerte; [...] "The Dynasty of Death") defeated them on March 19, 2012. A few months later Hijo de Pirata competed in the 2012 Rey del Ring ("King of the Ring") tournament, but lost to Trauma I, the eventual tournament winner. Not long after the tournament Hijo del Pirata Morgan won IWRG's 2012 La Gran Cruzada ("The Great Crusade") tournament, which also made him the number one contender for the IWRG Rey del Ring Championship. The tournament victory led to a match against champion Oficial Factor, which Hijo de Pirata won, becoming the next Rey del Ring. On September 16, 2012 he became a double champion when he defeated El Hijo de Máscara Año 2000 to win the Junior the Juniors title in a match where the Rey del Ring title was also on the line. His reign as Junior de Junior champion only lasted 7 days as he lost to Oficial Factor in a match where both championships were on the line against Oficial Factor's mask. The storyline feud with Oficial Factor kept escalating over the fall and winter of 2012, including both of them being involved in a multi-man Steel Cage Match where the last man in the ring would lose either their championship or their mask. Both Hijo de Pirata escaped the cage, ending with El Ángel winning the IWRG Intercontinental Middleweight Championship from Oficial AK-47. On October 21, 2012 Hijo de Pirata defeated Oficial Factor to regain the IWRG Junior de Juniors Championship. The feud between Hijo de Pirata Morgan and Oficial Factor kept escalating until the two of them as well as Oficial 911 and Hijo de Máscara Año 2000 all agreed to risk their masks in a Prison Fatal steel cage match on December 2, 2012. The Prison Fata match came down to Factor and Oficial 911 after both Hijo de Pirata and Hijo de Máscara escaped the cage to protect their masks. In the end 911 managed to escape, <b>forcing</b> <b>Factor</b> to unmask. On January 1, 2013, Hijo de Pirata lost the IWRG Junior de Juniors Championship back to Oficial Factor. On February 7, 2013, El Hijo de Pirata Morgan, Pirata Morgan and Pirata Morgan, Jr. defeated Los Oficiales (Oficial 911, Oficial AK-47 and Oficial Fierro) to win the Distrito Federal Trios Championship. On March 16, 2013 Hijo de Pirata Morgan teamed up with Cassandro to compete in a Ruleta de la Muerte, losers advance tag team tournament to commemorate the retirement of Ray Mendoza, Jr. The duo lost to Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. and Máscara Año 2000 in the first round and lost to El Solar and Toscano in the second round qualifying them for the finals where the losing team would be forced to either unmask (Hijo de Pirata Morgan) or have their hair shaved off (Casando). The team faced, and lost to the team of Villano IV and Ray Mendoza, Jr. which meant Hijo de Pirata Morgan had to unmask and reveal his birthname, Antheus Ortiz Chávez, as is traditional with Luchas de Apuestas losses. On March 24, 2013 Los Piratas won the vacant IWRG Intercontinental Trios Championship, winning a four way match against Los Oficiales (911, AK-47 and Fierro), La Familia de Tijuana (Mosco X-Fly, Super Nova and Eterno) and [...] Comandos Elite (Rayan and Factor) and Máscara Año 2000, Jr. On May 30, 2013 Hijo de Pirata Morgan defeated Eterno to win the IWRG Intercontinental Middleweight Championship. On November 4, Los Piratas lost the IWRG Intercontinental Trios Championship to Los Poderosos (Hombre Sin Miedo, Kendor Jr. and Sobredosis), only to regain it a week later. On March 29, 2015, Morgan lost the title to Veneno. On August 9, 2015 Los Piratas lost the IWRG Intercontinental Trios Championship to La Dinastía de la Muerte (Negro Navarro, Trauma I and Trauma II).

40|$|Abstract: New results {{concerning}} the dating of ‘Little Ice Age ’ glacier variations at Svartisen and Okstindan, northern Norway, are presented. Measurements of lichens of the Rhizocarpon subgenus on gravestones {{are used to}} construct several local sets of lichenometric dating curves. These are partly ‘adjusted ’ in relation to well-established lichenometric dating curves from southern Norway. The ‘Little Ice Age ’ maximum at Svartisen and Okstindan is thereby dated to the mid-eighteenth century (i. e., in agreement with southern Norway). Pre-viously suggested earlier ‘Little Ice Age ’ advances are demonstrated to have resulted from an underestimation of the growth rates of the Rhizocarpon subgenus. Synchroneity of ‘Little Ice Age ’ maxima in southern Norway and at Svartisen and Okstindan suggest that a north–south migration of latitudinal depressional tracks can be excluded as the main <b>forcing</b> <b>factor.</b> As an alternative, an increased SE–NW trend of moist air ow in winter parallel to the coast of Norway is suggested as the main <b>forcing</b> <b>factor</b> with recent glacier dynamics in response to recent climatic uctuations supporting this hypothesis...|$|E

The long-run causal link is examined using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test for cointegration, along with a vector error-correction model to estimate the short- and long-run parameters of equilibrium dynamics. Results show that remittances and GDP are cointegrated, with a statistically significant, positive causality running from remittances to output, while output is found {{not to be a}} long-run <b>forcing</b> <b>factor</b> of remittances in Egypt. The findings of this paper shed light on the importance of remittances for promoting economic growth in Egypt. Governmental policies that attract more remittance inflows, along with their efficient use, could promote economic growth in Egypt...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{study of}} {{variations}} in carbonate productivity, quantified by calcium carbonate content for a Valanginian-Hanterivian interval, is presented from the Angles-Vergons series (Vocontian basin). Spectral analysis techniques reveal {{the presence of}} significant carbonate cycles linked to cyclic variations of the Earth's orbit, The {{results suggest that the}} obliquity cycle is the most clearly defined signal whereas the presence of carbonate cycles related to the precession signal is less distinct. The transition from limestone-dominated alternations to marl-dominated alternations is characterized both by an increase of sedimentation rate and a change from the precession cycle being the dominant <b>forcing</b> <b>factor</b> in the calcareous part to the predominance of the obliquity cycle in the marly part. An orbitally calibrated chronology is presented for the Valanginian-Hanterivian interval based on the identification of carbonate cycles...|$|E

The new contributions of this paper are to define the numerical ranges of the dimensionless <b>force</b> <b>factor</b> for the weak, moderate and strong coupling and to study the connections of dimensionless <b>force</b> <b>factor,</b> coupling loss factor, coupling quotient, critical coupling strength, electro-mechanical coupling factor, damping loss factor and modal densities in linear vibration energy harvesting systems. The motivation {{of this paper is}} to enable statistical energy analysis of linear vibration energy harvesting systems for reliable performance predictions and design optimisation under parameter variations of materials and manufacturing processes and random ambient environmental excitations...|$|R
40|$|The {{transport}} system are sociotechnical systems {{in which the}} direct realization of the tasks is dealt with by an executive subsystem consisting of the elementary subsystems of a human- a technical object (an operator- a means of transport) type realizing the tasks within the system environment. In respect of a human located within a {{transport system}} the most significant criterion {{in the evaluation of}} the transports being realized is their safety. The safety level of the task realization is influenced by the risks resulting from the interaction of the <b>forcing</b> <b>factors,</b> affecting an elementary executive subsystem. These factors may be divided into [8]:- working,- External,- antropotechnical. In order to structure safety evaluation model of the road transport system we need to:- build the algorithm for evaluating safety of analysed system,- establish safety criterion for the system’s performance,- structure a model using the algorithm of safety evaluation of the system. Due to the complexity of the systems being analysed in the paper, it has been attempted to evaluate the influence of the <b>forcing</b> <b>factors</b> on the safety of this system operation.

40|$|For a drop on an incline {{with small}} tilt angle or small Bond number, when the contact {{line is a}} circle, we show that the {{retentive}} <b>force</b> <b>factor</b> is exactly pi/ 2 at first order in the tilt angle or the Bond number. The retentive <b>force</b> <b>factor</b> is the ratio between the weight component along the slope and a capillary force defined as surface tension times radius of contact line times difference of cosines of contact angles at the back and {{at the front of}} the drop. The drop profile is computed exactly in the same approximation. These results are compared with Surface Evolver results, showing a surprisingly large range of applicability of first order approximations. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|Various {{indices of}} hot weather {{frequency}} and intensity were analysed {{in the area}} of Poland in the period between 1951 and 2006. An increase of majority of them was shown in the whole year and all summer months but September, when significant decrease in all indices was apparent. The correlation of selected hot weather indices and precipitation totals in a month of hot weather event and the preceding months were also calculated to check if prolonged dry weather can constitute a <b>forcing</b> <b>factor</b> for hot event creation. Because significant correlations appear mainly in the cases when precipitation is for the same month as the hot weather index, it seems that in Poland the presence of high pressure systems is a more important factor of hot event creation than dry weather...|$|E
40|$|As {{efforts to}} {{recognize}} the Anthropocene as a new epoch of geological time are mounting, the controversial debate {{about the time of}} its beginning continues. Here, we suggest the term Palaeoanthropocene for the period between the first, barely recognizable, anthropogenic environmental changes and the industrial revolution when anthropogenically induced changes of climate, land use and biodiversity began to increase very rapidly. The concept of the Palaeoanthropocene recognizes that humans {{are an integral part of}} the Earth system rather than merely an external <b>forcing</b> <b>factor.</b> The delineation of the beginning of the Palaeoanthropocene will require an increase in the understanding and precision of palaeoclimate indicators, the recognition of archaeological sites as environmental archives, and inter-linking palaeoclimate, palaeoenvironmental changes and human development with changes in the distribution of Quaternary plant and animal species and socio-economic models of population subsistence and demise. 6 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Tree-ring-width index chronologies of teak (Tectona grandis L. F.) {{from three}} sites in central India {{have been studied}} for their dendroclimatic potential. The {{existence}} of good correlation among the three site chronologies indicates the influence of common <b>forcing</b> <b>factor</b> to the tree growth of the region. Tree growth and climate relationship based on correlation analysis revealed the important contribution of moisture index and rainfall rather than the direct influence of the temperature on tree growth during different seasons. Significant positive relationship of moisture index and rainfall during the monsoon months {{as well as on}} the annual scale with tree-ring width variations over the region indicates the important role of moisture availability at the root zone. The results suggest that the teak tree-ring chronologies can be used as high resolution proxy for past precipitation and moisture level in the environment. 1...|$|E
