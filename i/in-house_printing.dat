25|$|Some of the Dayton flood victims {{made their}} way to National Cash Register's factory and headquarters, where John H. Patterson, the company's president, and his factory workers {{assisted}} flood victims and relief workers. NCR employees built nearly 300 flat-bottomed rescue boats. Patterson organized rescue teams to save the thousands of people stranded on roofs and the upper stories of buildings. He turned the NCR factory on Stewart Street into an emergency shelter, providing food and lodging. He organized local doctors and nurses to provide medical care. NCR facilities served as the Dayton headquarters for the American Red Cross and Ohio National Guard relief and rescue efforts and provided food and shelter, a hospital and medical personnel, and a makeshift morgue. The company's grounds became a temporary campground for the city's homeless. Patterson also provided news reporters and photographers with food and lodging and access to equipment and communications to file their stories. When the presses of the Dayton Daily News became inoperable due to the floodwaters, the newspaper used NCR's <b>in-house</b> <b>printing</b> press, providing Dayton and NCR with press coverage on AP and UPI newswires.|$|E

40|$|A {{parametric}} {{framework for}} the analysis of transcriptome data is demonstrated to yield coincident results when applied to data acquired using two different microarray platforms. Discrepancies among transcriptome studies are frequently reported, casting doubt on the reliability of collected data. The inconsistency among observations can be largely attributed to differences among the analytical frameworks employed for data analysis. The existing frameworks normalizes data against a standard determined from the data to be analyzed. In the present study, a parametric framework based on a strict model for normalization is applied to data acquired using an <b>in-house</b> <b>printed</b> chip and GeneChip. The framework is based on a common statistical characteristic of microarray data, and each data is normalized {{on the basis of a}} linear relationship with this model. In the proposed framework, the expressional changes observed and genes selected are coincident between platforms, achieving superior universality of data compared to other methods...|$|R

40|$|The array CGH {{technique}} (Array Comparative Genome Hybridization) {{has been}} developed to detect chromosomal copy number changes on a genome-wide and/or high-resolution scale. It is used in human genetics and oncology, with great promise for clinical application. Until recently primarily PCR amplified bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) or cDNAs have been spotted as elements on the array. The large-scale DNA isolations or PCR amplifications of the large-insert clones necessary for manufacturing the arrays are elaborate and time-consuming. Lack of a high-resolution highly sensitive (commercial) alternative has undoubtedly hindered the implementation of array CGH in research and diagnostics. Recently, synthetic oligonucleotides as arrayed elements have been introduced as an alternative substrate for array CGH, both by academic institutions {{as well as by}} commercial providers. Oligonucleotide libraries or ready-made arrays can be bought off-the-shelf saving considerable time and efforts. For RNA expression profiling, we have seen a gradual transition from <b>in-house</b> <b>printed</b> cDNA-based expression arrays to oligonucleotide arrays and we expect a similar transition for array CGH. This review compares the different platforms and will attempt to shine a light on the ‘BAC to the future’ of the array CGH technique...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} placed {{transfer}} RNA (tRNA), a housekeeping molecule, {{in the heart}} of fundamental cellular processes such as embryonic development and tumor progression. Such discoveries were contingent on the concomitant development of methods able to deliver high-quality tRNA profiles. The present study describes the proof of concept obtained in Escherichia coli (E. coli) for an original tRNA analysis platform named SPOt (Streamlined Platform for Observing tRNA). This approach comprises three steps. First, E. coli cultures are spiked with radioactive orthophosphate; second, labeled total RNAs are trizol-extracted; third, RNA samples are hybridized on <b>in-house</b> <b>printed</b> microarrays and spot signals, the proxy for tRNA levels, are quantified by phosphorimaging. Features such as reproducibility and specificity were assessed using several tRNA subpopulations. Dynamic range and sensitivity were evaluated by overexpressing specific tRNA species. SPOt does not require any amplification or post-extraction labeling and can be adapted to any organism. It is modular and easily streamlined with popular techniques such as polysome fractionation to profile tRNAs interacting with ribosomes and actively engaged in translation. The biological relevance of these data is discussed in regards to codon usage, tRNA gene copy number, and position on the genome...|$|R

Specifically, surveyed agencies reported operating 64 percent fewer plants than the number listed in the Congress's Joint Committee on Printing's (JCP) Government Printing and Binding Regulations, updated in 1990 (1990 JCP Regulations). The Department of Defense (DOD) accounted for the greatest decline in <b>in-house</b> <b>printing</b> plants. The 1990 JCP Regulations listed 142 DOD printing plants; however, the Defense Logistics Agency, which currently manages the majority of DOD's printing infrastructure, reported 17 <b>in-house</b> <b>printing</b> plants in GAO's survey. In addition, most agencies reported operating toner-based high-speed duplication machines, and fewer reported operating ink-based conventional printing presses. Of the 32 agencies operating <b>in-house</b> <b>printing</b> plants, 17 reported that all of their <b>in-house</b> <b>printing</b> was conducted on high-speed duplication machines; another 14 agencies reported operating some duplication equipment in addition to conventional printing presses (the remaining agency did not report its type of equipment). No agency reported having only ink-based conventional printing presses at its in-house plants.

40|$|Recently, the {{cataloging}} {{department at}} Michigan State University Libraries {{was asked to}} catalog all 8000 full-text MSU ETDs in ProQuest. Since deriving MARC records by inserting appropriate MARC fields and pasting persistent URL from ProQuest database {{one at a time}} would be a very time-consuming process, an automated “batch-derive” process using XSLT was developed. This process selected and merged data from existing <b>in-house</b> <b>print</b> thesis records and ProQuest-created ETD records by matching various elements in the two record sets. Multi-step matching was called for since there was no common unique identifier among the two record sets and there were inconsistencies in data entry. Through this automated process, the cataloging department was able to incorporate data correction and customization into the batch process, and to insert persistent URLs into corresponding records in a fraction of time required for the manual process. Besides presenting the workflow and the design of the process itself, this presentation will also discusses quality issues in both in-house and ProQuest records, explain why ProQuest records were not loaded directly, the difficulties encountered during the implementation, the limitations of this batch process, and possible adaptation of this process for other copy and original cataloging activities.

40|$|Microarray {{analysis}} is a critically important technology for genome-enabled biology, {{therefore it is}} essential that the data obtained be reliable. Current software and normalization techniques for microarray analysis rely on the assumption that fluorescent background within spots is essentially the same throughout the glass slide and can be measured by fluorescence surrounding the spots. This assumption is not valid if background fluorescence is spot-localized. Inaccurate estimates of background fluorescence under the spot create a source of error, especially for low expressed genes. We have identified spot-localized, contaminating fluorescence in the Cy 3 channel on several commercial and <b>in-house</b> <b>printed</b> microarray slides. We determined through mock hybridizations (without labeled target) that pre-hybridization scans could not be used to predict the contribution of this contaminating fluorescence after hybridization because the change in spot-to-spot fluorescence after hybridization was too variable. Two solutions to this problem were identified. First, allowing 4 h of exposure to air prior to printing on to Corning UltraGAPS slides significantly reduced contaminating fluorescence intensities to approximately the value of the surrounding glass. Alternatively, application of a novel, hyperspectral imaging scanner and multivariate curve resolution algorithms, allowed the spectral contributions of Cy 3 signal, glass, and contaminating fluorescence to be distinguished and quantified after hybridization...|$|R
