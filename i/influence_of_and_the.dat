Bureau of Mines to determine the transport characteristics of highly concentrated paste backfill mixes made from dewatered total mine tailings. The slurry concentrations of the mixes were all above 78 pct by weight with slumps ranging from 6. 4 to 16. 5 cm (2. 5 to 6. 5 in). Laboratory material property tests and full-scale pumping tests were conducted using pipe diameters of 102, 128, and 154 mm (4, 5, and 6 in) and a positive-displacement pump. The results indicated that the tested backfill mixes can be successfully transported as a stiff paste and identified the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> interaction among the various mix and system variables...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The energy {{industry}} has recently begun using smart meters to take finegrained readings of energy usage. These smart meters enable flexible time-of-use billing, forecasting, and demand response, {{but they also}} raise serious user privacy concerns. We propose a novel technique for provably hiding sensitive power consumption information in the overall power consumption stream. Our technique relies on a rechargeable battery that {{is connected to the}} household’s power supply. This battery is used to modify the household’s power consumption by adding or subtracting noise (i. e., increasing or decreasing power consumption), in order to establish strong privacy guarantees in the sense of differential privacy. To achieve these privacy guarantees in realistic settings, we first investigate the <b>influence</b> <b>of,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> interplay between, capacity and throughput bounds that batteries face in reality. We then propose an integrated method based on noise cascading that allows for recharging the battery on-the-fly so that differential privacy is retained, while adhering to capacity and throughput constraints, and while keeping the additional consumption of energy induced by our technique to a minimum. ...|$|E
40|$|Parental {{role in the}} {{transmission}} of ethical and moral values The primary {{focus of this article}} is to describe the characteristics and nature of the process of transmitting moral and ethical values from parents to children. The transmission of values within the framework of parents and family implies a horizontal as well as a vertical dimension. The role of parents and family can, however, not be evaluated in isolation. On a horizontal level the influence of philosophical trends and traditions, psychological theories, time-determined attitudes and social conditions are thus scrutinised in order to understand reality and different perspectives on man’s position in this world. In particular structuralistic and psychoanalytic views, as well as social determinants in {{the transmission}} of values, are discussed. Parents’ task as educators is also seen from the specific perspective of parental role in the process of instruction, parents’ modelling function and the influence of world view and attitude in transmitting moral and ethical values. In conclusion the vertical dimension of value transmission is also indicated: the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> way in which children internalise religious values and a sense of religiosity is thus established...|$|E

40|$|Economy and {{reliability}} are requirements that innovative vehicle concepts for public transport operations need to fulfil. In {{the context of}} inductive charging, the interdependency between the dimensioning of power electronics and drive aggregates of the vehicles and the charging infrastructure {{need to be taken}} into consideration. Life-cycle costs of stationary infrastructure and compatible vehicles need to be reflected. The battery significantly determines the investment and the vehicle weight. This has to be weighed up against the required high level of operational availability. The planning process of the introduction of electrically charged vehicles aims for the maximization of operational availability. The evaluation of the application of novel energy-supplies and drive concepts requires a tool that combines several systems and aspects. These include transportation scheduling, the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> interaction with general traffic and also kinematic models. The open source software SUMO can be applied. Real operational data from vehicles that are currently in service allows appropriate model calibration. In Brunswick (Germany), the line M 19 was taken into consideration for the electrification with inductively charged buses. The simulation clearly showed that not only varying traffic conditions have to be reflected, but also the passenger occupancy. The energy consumption of a single drive-cycle varies by about 20...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The Visual Predictive Check (VPC) is a {{valuable}} and supportive instrument for evaluating model performance. However in its most commonly applied form, the method largely depends on a subjective comparison {{of the distribution of}} the simulated data with the observed data, without explicitly quantifying and relating the information in both. In recent adaptations to the VPC this drawback is taken into consideration by presenting the observed and predicted data as percentiles. In addition, in some of these adaptations the uncertainty in the predictions is represented visually. However, it is not assessed whether the expected random distribution of the observations around the predicted median trend is realised in relation to the number of observations. Moreover the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> information residing in missing data at each time point is not taken into consideration. Therefore, in this investigation the VPC is extended with two methods to support a less subjective and thereby more adequate evaluation of model performance: (i) the Quantified Visual Predictive Check (QVPC) and (ii) the Bootstrap Visual Predictive Check (BVPC).

40|$|Perceptual {{grouping}} is a pre-attentive {{process which}} serves to group local elements into global wholes, based on shared properties. One effect of perceptual grouping is to distort {{the ability to}} estimate the distance between two elements. In this study, biases in distance estimates, caused by four types of perceptual grouping, were measured across three tasks, a perception, a drawing and a construction task in both typical development (TD: Experiment 1) and in individuals with Williams syndrome (WS: Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, perceptual grouping distorted distance estimates across all three tasks. Interestingly, the effect of grouping by luminance was {{in the opposite direction}} to the effects of the remaining grouping types. We relate this to differences in the ability to inhibit perceptual grouping effects on distance estimates. Additive distorting influences were also observed in the drawing and the construction task, which are explained in terms of the points of reference employed in each task. Experiment 2 demonstrated that the above distortion effects are also observed in WS. Given the known deficit in the ability to use perceptual grouping in WS, this suggests a dissociation between the pre-attentive <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> attentive deployment of perceptual grouping in WS. The typical distortion in relation to drawing and construction points towards the presence of some typical location coding strategies in WS. The performance of the WS group differed from the TD participants on two counts. First, the pattern of overall distance estimates (averaged across interior and exterior distances) across the four perceptual grouping types, differed between groups. Second, the distorting influence of perceptual grouping was strongest for grouping by shape similarity in WS, which contrasts to a strength in grouping by proximity observed in the TD participants.

40|$|In {{an urban}} context, {{architecture}} and landscape architecture co-exist {{as part of}} the structure of the city. In the same manner, interior architecture exists as part of an architectural envelope, and product design as an integral part of the interior. This study explores the relationship between these design disciplines and their interdependence; none of them can be practiced optimally in isolation. As this thesis deals with interior architecture, the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> response to other fields of design are considered and investigated, setting the parameters for the resolution of the design framework. The objective of the thesis is to design a tourism and information centre for Tshwane. The shortcomings of the tourism industry in the city are identified in Chapter Two, and the tourism field studied in depth in Chapter Three. The conclusions from these chapters serve as generators for the functional design process. The site of the Old Fire Station Building was chosen for both its potential and its inadequacies. Its physical attributes, historical importance and its critical role in the urban context of the CBD and the Museum Park District are discussed in Chapter Four. Chapter Five deals with the design philosophy and approach to creating a successful public space. Precedents are analytically examined in Chapter Six and alternatives are explored, setting up requirements and guidelines for the design intervention. In Chapter Seven, design strategies are defined and consequently employed. The progression of the design from general concept to specific end product is illustrated visually. Attention is focused on two parts of the building: the information area (Portion A) and the café (Portion B). In Chapter Eight, Portion A is further developed on a technical and tectonic level, zooming in on the construction of the information reception box. The study concludes with the technical documentation contained in Chapter Nine. The study relies throughout on the application of the concepts of placemaking through the layering, defining and containing of space, and contrast the existing with the proposed intervention.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} offer a re-evaluation {{of the nature of}} {{political}} culture in England during the years of civil war through the use of visual material. There exists a rich body of pictorial evidence and yet it is frequently overlooked completely or used very selectively to illustrate conclusions reached through close studies of other source material, particularly popular print. However, this thesis takes as its starting point the intensely visual nature of early modern political and popular culture and utilises material as wide-ranging as court portraiture, satirical woodcuts and objects such as coins and medallions. By focusing in particular on the visual language of idealised kingship which developed under Charles l, this thesis will question the existence of the bi-polar model of political participation so frequently depicted in the historiography of the period by demonstrating the conservative and consensual nature of much of the imagery. Therefore, this study explores the manner in which a broad and popular audience responded to the pictorial depiction of their king as divine and as the fulcrum of social order. This makes it necessary to consider {{the manner in which the}} imagery of idealised kingship was disseminated outside the court, therefore placing it within the context of an increasingly politicised populace. Through this, the extent to which models of conflict and consensus could co-exist will be demonstrated, leading to an evaluation of the intrinsically conservative self-identification of the parliamentarian cause and of popular allegiance, particularly through the polemical constructs of 'cavalier' and 'roundhead '. It will be suggested that propagandist images of kingship became embedded in political culture because they reflected broadly accepted norms of social behaviour. This proves to be essential in understanding the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> extent to which Charles I became the personification of the body politic, ultimately enabling his aura of sanctity to deepen during the wars and after the regicide, whilst hindering the possibility of the Rump establishing its own distinctive imagery of political authority. By offering an alternative body of evidence, this thesis seeks to demonstrate that the visual language of king ship became the language of social normality and authority.

40|$|Spurred on by {{the promise}} of a quantum “speed-up” for certain classes of {{computational}} problems, interest in quantum computation has seen a great surge over the past decades. One of the approaches is confining carriers in “quantum dots”, small regions in a semiconductor, such that quantum properties become observable. The first step in creating quantum dots in semiconductors is having exact control over the confinement potential. However, defects, coming about by disorder or other fabricational issues are of great influence on quantum dot formation. This work concerns the properties of hole quantum dots under the <b>influence</b> <b>of,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> charge transport through, these defects. We thoroughly explore the silicon-based heterostructure of these devices and most prominently look at the Si/SiO 2 interface and its associated defects. We explore the origin of these defects, and devise methods of eliminating them. We find that the ability to passivate defects at the Si/SiO 2 interface hinges primarily on controlling the dewetting at higher temperatures. We introduce an ALD-grown Al 2 O 3 layer, which strikes two birds with one stone. The layer both provides hydrogen for the annealing process and prevents dewetting. The introduction of Al 2 O 3 introduces a layer of negative fixed charge, which can be eliminated or controlled by exposure to a UV-ozone oxidation process. We also find that by supplanting Al by Pd as the electrode material, the formation of an interfacial layer between the metal and the oxide is prevented We show that we can indeed make a hole quantum dot in intrinsic silicon, by demonstrating single-hole tunneling through a two-dimensional hole gas. Furthermore, by using Al 2 O 3 grown by atomic-layer deposition in an annealing process, we passivate the majority of the electrically active defects. The most likely candidates for the observed defects are Pb centers, E′ centers, or unintentional quantum dots created by thermally induced strain. Using the Al 2 O 3 oxide, and the passivating properties of the hydrogen contained therein, we are able to create intentional quantum dots of at least 180 nm. These quantum dots show many charge transitions, indicating the low level of disorder in the devices. We also study the g-factor anisotropy a hole quantum dot in silicon. We do this by studying the Zeeman splitting in a magnetic field capable of rotating 360 ∘ over all 3 degrees of freedom. Using two methods of fitting the data to our model, we extract similar anisotropies for the g-tensor (g∥*≈ 2. 2, g⊥*≈ 4), indicating that the g-factor is roughly twice as strong out-of-plane than in-plane. This is consistent with the prediction that light-holes and heavy-holes are oriented preferentially in a 2 D quantum well. A proof-of-principle of a single-layer depletion-mode hole quantum dot is demonstrated. The negative fixed charge in ALD-grown Al 2 O 3 enables the operation in depletion-mode by inducing a 2 D hole gas. Characterization of the charge-offset stability of this device indicates that the device is extremely stable, with the charge-offset stability having an upper bound at Q 0 = 0. 04 e and a lower bound of Q 0 = 0. 005 e. This compares favourably to previously known results for all-Si based devices (Q 0 < 0. 01 e) and Al-based devices (Q 0 < 0. 15 e) ...|$|E
