Peanuts are in fact grown in most ACP countries. Research on improved peanut varieties has {{for a long time}} been dormant, but the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), seems to be quickly making up for this (see also Spore 91). For the past decade, research on groundnuts has focused on varieties that are suited for local conditions, such as drought, poor soils and a range of pests and diseases. In Africa, leaf spot, aflatoxine contamination, groundnut rosette and foliar disease often lead to considerable harvest losses. In West Africa, ICRISAT has been releasing numerous disease-resistant varieties for testing among farmers. In Samanko, almost literally the back garden of the ICRISAT centre in Mali, a women s group has been successfully testing some of these varieties. In ideal conditions, a peanut harvest can amount to three tonnes per hectare but traditional varieties in Mali do not yield more than 500 kg/ha. In the tests, some new varieties are yielding more than 1 tonne/ha and are maturing in only 90 days instead of 115 days traditionally. The women determine which varieties pass the test and will be distributed to other regions. They have rejected certain lines of varieties with promising high yields, for one that has more attractive seeds or is more suitable for their goats. It is, ICRISAT tell us, the women who are the major players. That, they say, is what participation is all about. We look forward to the women s side of the story!

The differences and similarities of these three groups have been brought out in this paper. The topics that were studied were production, methods, processing, marketing, certification, but also work organisation, knowledge management, social topics and finally the estimation of own strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats and future goals. The goals of organic producers and the strategies to achieve them vary considerably,- the farmers in farmer groups and co-operatives mostly aim at becoming more self-sufficient by improving the farm management with organic farming methods and by reducing costly external in-puts. Furthermore, the improvement of their health by doing without pesticides and spirituality are important goals for these small-scale farmers.

The higher-populated and higher-income countries generate higher amounts of MSW. Not only the MSW amount, but the MSW composition can also be diverse in different countries. This study investigates the composition of MSW generated in Bangkok compared to other Asian megacities, for example, Beijing, Tokyo, Seoul, Singapore and Hong Kong. In addition, the MSW management model integrated with the Waste-to-Energy (WtE) concept will be analyzed and compared. With Bangkok as the case study, {{because of a lack of}} regulations and public participation, there is no MSW separation at the households; hence, the MSW generated contains higher organic waste which results in less calorific value of MSW compared to other developed countries. Mixed wet MSW is the main shortcoming of WtE development.

40|$|In {{parallel}} {{with changes in}} official standards, supermarket chains in Europe have developed prescriptive, production-oriented standards, e. g. the European Union Retailers Produce Working Group for Good Agricultural Practices (GlobalGAP), and are asking their suppliers for produce to be certified according to food-safety and quality standards. There are concerns that the proliferation and enhanced stringency of standards that are imposed by high-income countries can negatively affect the competitiveness of <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> developing countries and impede actors from entering or even remaining in high-value food markets. Yet, in some cases, others argue that such standards can play a positive role, providing the catalyst and incentives for the modernization of export supply and regulatory systems and the adoption of safer and more sustainable production practices. This article provides an empirical analysis of EU private food-safety standards impact on pesticide use and farm-level productivity among smallholder <b>export</b> vegetable <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> Kenya. We apply an extended three-stage damage control production framework that accounts for multiple endogeneity problems to farm-level data collected from a random cross-section sample of 439 small-scale vegetable producers. Estimation results show that <b>export</b> <b>producers</b> complying with private standards significantly use less toxic pesticides; however {{there is no significant}} difference on the total quantity of pesticides used. Contrary to findings elsewhere, the econometric evidences here show that export vegetable farmers in Kenya use pesticide below the economic optimum. The third stage structural revenue model results demonstrate a positive and significant impact of standards adoption on revenue of vegetable production. While food safety and quality standards can be a barrier for resource poor smallholders to maintain their position in the lucrative export markets, they can also induce positive changes in production systems of small-scale farmers who adopt it as shown by the results presented. Generally this article partly supports the notion that adoption of emerging food-safety standards can serve as a catalyst in transforming the production systems of developing countries towards safer and more sustainable production.

This paper investigates the possible negative impacts of VSPPs on control and protection systems of distribution networks located in a metropolitan area. Three case studies of real, existing VSPP in 24 kV distribution network are practically presented with short-circuit analysis and dynamic analysis primarily focusing on undisconnected VSPP during faults, and unintentional islanding.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsJason S. BergtoldTimothy J. DaltonAdoption of {{technological}} improvements {{are crucial to}} increase agricultural productiviy to help reduce poverty by obtaining higher farm incomes due to higher productivity and lower production costs. However, {{the introduction of new}} agricultural technologies has not always been successful or had diffuse adoption. Factors that determine farmers’ adoption decisions are: 1) farm and farmers' characteristics; 2) technology attributes, and 3) the farming objective. Understanding these factors and how they affect adoption of new technologies on the farm is crucial to assure higher levels of adoption. The over all purpose of this thesis is to explore the adoption process of new technologies and practices by farmers. This is accomplished through three essays to meet the objectives of the thesis. 	The purpose of the first essay was to evaluate whether or not farmers in the western U. S. are willing to grow specialized oilseed crops {{that could be used for}} certified hydrotreated renewable jet (HRJ) fuel production and incorporate them into existing wheat-based production systems under contract. Results indicate that providing oilseeds crops and contracts with desired attributes and features would positively affect farmers' decisions to incorporate oilseed crops into their rotation system. Preferred seed and contract attributes that may affect a farmer’ adoption decision differ across different geographic regions of the U. S. The second essay focused on identifying factors that impact participation and farmers' decision to adopt soil conservation and fertilization management practices for cassava <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> <b>Thailand</b> and Vietnam. Results indicate that asset ownership and cassava yield positively influence participation. Adoption of new practices was positively linked to farmers’ participation in training activities, use of fish ponds (as a measure of alternative agricultural practices), presence of a nearby starch factory, and slope of the land. Finally, the purpose of the third essay was to examine extension educators' characteristics that affect educators' selection decision of outreach methods in the U. S. This essay examines the diffusion process that impacts adoption of best management practices by farmers. The decision extension educators make for selecting a teaching method is affected by the relationship between the objectives of the learning process and the characteristics of the teaching method...|$|R
