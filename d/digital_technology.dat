The thesis looks at the facilitators and barriers to using <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> effectively and explores the challenges for educators as they respond to the changes {{brought about by the}}se <b>digital</b> <b>technologies.</b> It presents eight published works that have investigated {{the impact of}} <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> and collected data using a range of qualitative and quantitative techniques. The core paper provides a model by which the impact of <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> can be analysed and understood and the remaining papers populate that model. The model identifies a system of learning spaces that describe the ways that learners, teachers and managers respond to the challenges and opportunities that <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> bring to learning.

At this point of their career, Hermética performed mainly in Argentina, except for one concert held in Uruguay.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> policies {{designed for}} Australian {{schools and the}} ways they are understood and interpreted by students, school staff, teachers, principals and policy writers. This study explores the ways these research participant groups interpret and understand the ‘ethical dimension’ of schools’ <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> policies for teaching and learning. In this thesis the ethical dimension {{is considered to be}} a dynamic concept which encompasses various elements including; decisions, actions, values, issues, debates, education, discourses, and notions of right and wrong, in relation to ethics and uses of <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> in schools. In this study policy is taken to mean not only written texts but discursive processes, policy documents including national declarations, strategic plans and ‘acceptable use’ policies to guide the use of <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> in schools. The research is situated in the context of changes that have occurred in Australia and internationally over the last decade that have seen a greater focus on the access to and use of <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> in schools. In Australian school education, the attention placed on <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> in schools has seen the release of policies at the national, state, territory, education office and school levels, to guide their use. Prominent among these policies has been the Digital Education Revolution policy, launched in 2007 and concluded in 2013. This research aims to answers the question: What does an investigation reveal about understandings of the ethical dimension of <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> policies and their implementation in school education? The objective of this research is to examine the ethical dimension of <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> policies and to interpret and understand the responses of the research participants to the issues, silences, discourses and language, which characterise this dimension. In doing so, it is intended that the research can allow the participants to have a voice that, may be different to the official discourses located in <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> policies. The thesis takes a critical and interpretative approach to policies and examines the role of <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> policies as discourse. Interpretative theory is utilised as it provides a conceptual lens from which to interpret different perspectives and the implications of these in the construction of meaning in relation to schools’ <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> policies. Critical theory is used in tandem with interpretative theory as it represents a conceptual basis from which to critique and question underlying assumptions and discourses that are associated with the ethical dimension of schools’ <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> policies. The research methods used are semi-structured interviews and policy document analysis. Policies from the national, state, territory, education office and school level were analysed and contribute to understanding the way the ethical dimension of <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> policies is represented as a discourse. Students, school staff, teachers, principals and policy writers participated in research interviews and their views and perspectives were canvassed in relation to the ethical use of <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> and the policies that are designed to regulate their use. The thesis presents an argument that the ethical dimension of schools’ <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> policies and use is an under-researched area, and there are gaps in understanding and knowledge in the literature which remain to be addressed. It is envisaged that the thesis can make a meaningful contribution to understand the ways in which schools’ <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> policies are understood in school contexts. It is also envisaged that the findings from the research can inform policy development by analysing the voices and views of those in schools. The findings of the policy analysis revealed that there is little attention given to the ethical dimension in <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> at the national level. A discourse of compliance and control pervades <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> policies from the state, education office and school levels, which reduces ethical considerations to technical, legal and regulatory requirements. The discourse is largely instrumentalist and neglects the educative dimension of <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> which has the capacity to engender their ethical use. The findings from the interview conversations revealed that students, school staff and teachers perceive <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> policies to be difficult to understand, and not relevant to their situation and needs. They also expressed a desire to have greater consultation and participation in the formation and enactment of <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> policies, and they believe they are marginalised from these processes in their schools. Arising from the analysis of the policies and interview conversations, an argument is presented that in the light of the prominent role played by <b>digital</b> <b>technologies</b> and their potential for enhancing all aspects of school education, more research is required to provide a more holistic and richer understanding of the policies that are constructed to control and mediate their use...|$|R

In 1974, Atari engineer Harold Lee proposed a home version of Pong that would connect to a television: Home Pong. The system began development under the codename Darlene, named after an attractive female employee at Atari. Alcorn worked with Lee to develop the designs and prototype, and based them on the same <b>digital</b> <b>technology</b> used in their arcade games. The two worked in shifts to save time and money; Lee worked on the design's logic during the day, while Alcorn debugged the designs in the evenings. After the designs were approved, fellow Atari engineer Bob Brown assisted Alcorn and Lee in building a prototype. The prototype consisted of a device attached to a wooden pedestal containing over a hundred wires, which would eventually be replaced with a single chip designed by Alcorn and Lee; the chip {{had yet to be}} tested and built before the prototype was constructed.

5|$|Gradually, the low {{frequency}} active RC filter was supplanted by the switched-capacitor filter that operated in the discrete time domain {{rather than the}} continuous time domain. All of these filter technologies require precision components for high performance filtering, and that often requires that the filters be tuned. Adjustable components are expensive, and the labor to do the tuning can be significant. Tuning the poles and zeros of a 7th-order elliptic filter {{is not a simple}} exercise. Integrated circuits have made digital computation inexpensive, so now {{low frequency}} filtering is done with digital signal processors. Such digital filters have no problem implementing ultra-precise (and stable) values, so no tuning or adjustment is required. Digital filters also don't have to worry about stray coupling paths and shielding the individual filter sections from one another. One downside is the digital signal processing may consume much more power than an equivalent LC filter. Inexpensive <b>digital</b> <b>technology</b> has largely supplanted analogue implementations of filters. However, there is still an occasional place for them in the simpler applications such as coupling where sophisticated functions of frequency are not needed.|$|E
