25|$|The Godfather II {{is an open}} world action-adventure {{game played}} from a third-person perspective, in which the player {{controls}} Dominic, Don of the Corleone family in New York City, and Michael Corleone's underboss. The basic gameplay and game mechanics fall into the subgenre of Grand Theft Auto clones, as the player can travel throughout the game world freely, commandeer vehicles, <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> want in terms of attacking and/or killing innocent civilians, and progress through the storyline at their own leisure, spending as much time traversing the city as they wish.|$|E

25|$|Scorsese {{initially}} {{named the}} film Wise Guy and postponed making it; later, he and Pileggi {{changed the name}} to Goodfellas. To prepare for their roles in the film, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta often spoke with Pileggi, who shared research material left over from writing the book. According to Pesci, improvisation and ad-libbing came out of rehearsals wherein Scorsese gave the actors freedom to <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> wanted. The director made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines he liked best, {{and put them into}} a revised script, which the cast worked from during principal photography.|$|E
25|$|While at Naco, Villa {{requested}} that several hundred of his wounded be trasported by rail through the United States to Juarez, Chiahuahua, as Carranza {{had been allowed}} to transport troops and supplies; that request was denied. After resting his troops at Naco, Villa gathered up the remainder of his forces and attacked the town of Hermosillo, Sonora, on November 21, 1915. In order to try to restore the morale of his troops, he promised them that after they took the city, they could <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> wanted with the town and its inhabitants. This actually ended up causing the attack to fail, as his men almost immediately turned to looting and rape rather than fighting, which allowed the defending forces to reorganize and drive the Villistas out.|$|E

When Ned scolds Homer for allowing so many immoral activities to go on, Homer retorts that the situation is Ned's fault as he has abused his power and literally played God over the town. Ned apologizes to the town for his interference, and he and Homer proceed to destroy all the cameras. The final scene reveals that Bakerbutcher has been using the footage to put together a British reality television series called The American Oafs, which Queen Elizabeth II enjoys watching because Ralph Wiggum reminds her of her son, Prince Charles.|$|E
500|$|Clarkson {{fought with}} her bosses to prevent [...] "Already Gone" [...] from being {{released}} as a single, {{out of respect}} for Knowles.

In September 2009, Clarkson told MTV that it was unfortunate the two songs sound exactly the same, but noted that they have different vocal melodies.|$|E
500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "C", largely criticizing the {{installment}} for its apparent randomness. He argued that [...] "being {{in a dream}} allows the writers to <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> want without any explanation, meaning characters and environments change suddenly and constantly, leaving the viewer as confused as Finn." [...] Sava felt that the only scenes with any pathos were to be found {{near the end of}} the episode, but even they were [...] "still more focused on bizarre imagery than emotional depth", such as the sequence wherein Finn's fears manifest themselves by emerging from his navel. Sava did compliment the episode's designs, however, writing that [...] "this episode puts the show’s off-kilter design sense on full display." ...|$|E

[...] "Beat Goes On" [...] was certified platinum in Brazil for selling over 100,000 digital downloads. It also charted inside the top-twenty in Finland and on the Canadian Hot 100 chart.

500|$|It {{became evident}} {{by the third}} day of {{production}} that the episode was going to run significantly short, partly caused by the time-efficient filming style. The scene in which Daniel informs Jack and Teal'c of the opportunity to <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> like, was a late pitch by Brad Wright, who had also had the idea for some time to show someone golfing through the Stargate. Preliminary discussions about computer-generating the golf ball to not break the US$100,000 Stargate prop were later overturned, and the actors used a real golf ball. Many of the other humorous scenes in [...] "Window of Opportunity" [...] were improvised on set during filming. With juggling being one of Richard Dean Anderson's earlier careers, director Peter DeLuise filmed the juggling sequence in a last effort to fill the episode's time slot. [...] "Window of Opportunity" [...] has no deleted scenes.|$|E

500|$|... "Beat Goes On" [...] was re-recorded in October 2007 by Spike Spent, Andrew Coleman and Alex Dromgoole at Sarm Studios, London, {{and at the}} Record Plant Studios, California. Spent and Coleman also mixed {{the track}} at the Record Plant. Williams' {{production}} team, The Neptunes, produced the track, with Madonna. The song was written by Madonna and Williams, with rap vocals by West, and the title is a reference to The Whispers' disco track [...] "And the Beat Goes On" [...] (1980). [...] "Beat Goes On" [...] is a disco song, with funk and hip-hop influences, drum beat and bell chimes, as well as Williams' shimmering, thumping production, which according to Bradley Stern from Idolator, [...] "offers Madonna the perfect groove to wax bombastic about the cathartic pleasures of dancing."

500|$|Balzac {{demonstrated}} {{these beliefs}} through the characters' lives in La Cousine Bette. The conflict between Baron Hulot and the perfumer Crevel mirrors the animosity between the aristocracy of the Ancien Régime {{and the newly}} developed bourgeoisie of traders and industrial entrepreneurs. Although he despised the socialist politics of Eugène Sue, Balzac worried that bourgeois desperation for financial gain drove people from life's important virtues. The characters– especially Bette, Valérie, and Crevel– are fixated on their need for money, and <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> must to obtain it. As Crevel explains to Adeline: [...] "Vous vous abusez, cher ange, si vous croyez que c'est le roi Louis-Philippe qui règne... au-dessus de la Charte il y a la sainte, la vénérée, la solide, l'aimable, la gracieuse, la belle, la noble, la jeune, la toute-puissante pièce de cent sous!"

500|$|Clarkson was furious, and confronted Tedder on the phone. In response, Tedder {{commented that}} he would never give two artists the same musical arrangement, and that her {{criticism}} was [...] "hurtful and absurd". He asserted that the concept, melodies, and lyrics of [...] "Already Gone" [...] and [...] "Halo" [...] are completely different. Calling [...] "Already Gone" [...] one of the best songs he had ever composed, Tedder challenged people to [...] "listen [...] and form their own opinions". Clarkson discouraged her label, RCA, from releasing [...] "Already Gone" [...] as a single because she respected Beyoncé, but they went against her will and released it. She said, [...] "It's one of those things I have no control over. I already made my album. At this point, the record company can <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> want with it."

50|$|What {{prevented}} the shugo lords from simply <b>doing</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> pleased was the tenuous link of appointment, particularly new appointees who had emerged with Takauji—they had {{a vested interest}} in maintaining their links to the regime, insofar as they had not yet built up their power in the provinces. Those provincial families who had accumulated power throughout the Kamakura period, like the Ouchi of Suo and Nagato provinces and the Shimazu of Satsuma province, were lords in their own right, and were, thus, less dependent on the regime and on their shugo titles.|$|R

At the reunion, Rob Sussman, a past classmate of Liz's, complains that Liz said he was gayer than the volleyball scene in the 1986 action film Top Gun. During the reunion, Liz's former classmates play Seven minutes in heaven, {{a game in which}} two people are selected to go into a closet or other dark enclosed space and <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> like for seven minutes, often kissing. Later, Liz's classmates plan to [...] "Carrie" [...] her on stage as revenge for her being mean to them, but is stopped by Jack saying [...] "we cannot Carrie Liz Lemon".

500|$|The {{writers were}} new to screenwriting, so their film {{treatment}} ran to 110-pages; the average was 15 pages. Reitman and Simmons pitched it to various Hollywood studios. Simmons met with Ned Tanen, {{an executive at}} Universal Studios. He was encouraged by younger executives Sean Daniel and Thom Mount who were more receptive to the Lampoon type of humor; Mount had discovered the [...] "Seven Fires" [...] film treatment as Tanen's assistant, while investigating projects left by a fired studio executive. Tanen hated the idea. Ramis remembers, [...] "We went further than I think Universal expected or wanted. I think they were shocked and appalled. Chris' fraternity had virtually been a vomiting cult. And {{we had a lot}} of scenes that were almost orgies of vomit... We didn't back off anything". As the writers created more drafts of the screenplay (nine in total), the studio gradually became more receptive to the project, especially Mount, who championed it. The studio green-lighted the film and set the budget at a modest $3 million. Simmons remembers, [...] "They just figured, 'Screw it, it's a silly little movie, and we’ll make a couple of bucks if we're lucky—let them <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> want.' ...|$|E

The territory under Leopold's control exceeded [...] and, amid financial problems, was ruled by a tiny cadre of white administrators drawn from across Europe. Initially, the colony proved unprofitable and insufficient, with the state always close to bankruptcy. The boom in demand for natural rubber, which was abundant in the territory, created a radical shift in the 1890s—to facilitate the extraction and export of rubber, all [...] "uninhabited" [...] land in the Congo was nationalised, with the majority distributed to private companies as concessions. Some was kept by the state. Between 1891 and 1906, the companies were allowed to <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> wished with almost no judicial interference, the result being that forced labour and violent coercion were used to collect the rubber cheaply and maximise profit. A native paramilitary army, the Force Publique, was also created to enforce the labour policies. Individual workers who refused to participate in rubber collection could be killed and entire villages razed. Individual white administrators were also free to indulge their own sadism.|$|E

Gobineau wrote that Aryans in their original, pure state <b>did</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>they</b> liked because they were superior to anyone else and had no external morality. Rowbotham wrote about Gobineau's Aryan theories that: [...] "Stripped of its racial mysticism it makes force a virtue and even a necessity.
