For example, he had the asylum’s grounds continually landscaped, established an accessible library for patients, and offered weekly dances and religious services for patient enjoyment. In addition, Dr. Fisher did not place patients in solitary confinement nor prescribe many medications, as is reflected in the 1862 annual asylum report where only $95.13 was recorded to have been spent on narcotics. However, the asylum’s other practices do reflect the hegemonic attitudes towards mental illness during the nineteenth century.

40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} the {{factors associated with}} different health-outcomes following retirement. Method: We randomly selected a sample of 869 male and female subjects aged 60 years or older from the databases of a supplemental retirement fund and followed them from 1982 (T 1) to 2002 (T 5). During the study period, we recorded information concerning their social status and health five different times by using both interviews and auto-questionnaires. The subsequent statistical analysis was designed to identify the factors at T 1 which could predict the evolution in their state of health between T 1 and T 5. Results: A total of 532 (61. 2 %) subjects died between T 1 and T 5. 120 subjects were still {{participating in the study}} at T 5, corresponding to 53. 3 % of the surviving subjects in August 2002 among those who were enrolled at T 1. 66 % of the males and 50. 7 % of the females considered that their quality of life was good. More than one subject out of two stated that he or she didn’t require any assistance to perform normal, daily activities other than routine <b>housekeeping</b> <b>chores.</b> The study identified four factors at T 1 which predicted future ageing without the need for assistance: age, social status, degree of physical activity in males and the absence of any cardio-respiratory disorder in females. Conclusion: The results suggest that more than 30 % of subjects older than 85 years state that they live without assistance, except for routine <b>housekeeping</b> <b>chores.</b> The study also underscores the relationship between factors which are present a few years after retirement and the health-outcome at old age...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper answers a {{question}} raised by Vladimir Pestov. Let G be a non-trivial group of isometries of a complete, separable metric space. Let ^G be the semi-group arising from its completion {{with respect to}} the left uniformity. Then there is a uniformly continuous function from ^G to the unit interval which assumes both extreme points on any non-empty right ideal. Greg Hjorth 1 July 25, 2006 This paper has one main theorem. If G is a group of isometries of a space X, ^G the semi-group that arises as its completion in a certain natural sense, then we can find uniformly continuous functions on X 2 that display high oscillation on the image of any ae 2 ^G. There are some details to be added to make this statement precise, but they are unsurprising, and can be postponed. There are some further issues about when X 2 can be replaced by X, and what one can say for specific classes of X and G, and these need also to be eventually addressed. Before any of these <b>housekeeping</b> <b>chores,</b> I want to give an extended aside on two seemingly unrelated results in combinatorics, which can actually be viewed as lying {{at the heart of this}} theorem. Although these results are well known, the proofs are sufficiently short to be included, and the proof of the second of these will be needed at a later point.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Most {{survivors}} of an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) are ADL-independent, {{but they often}} experience restrictions in (social) activities and, therefore, cannot regain their pre-morbid level of participation. OBJECTIVE: In this study, participation restrictions and participation satisfaction experienced after aSAH were assessed. Moreover, possible predictors of participation after aSAH were examined to identify goals for rehabilitation. METHOD: Participation restrictions experienced {{by a series of}} 67 patients visiting our SAH outpatient clinic were assessed as part of standard clinical care using the Participation Restrictions and Satisfaction sections of the Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of Rehabilitation Participation (USER-Participation) 6 months after aSAH. Cognitive impairments, cognitive and emotional complaints, and symptoms of depression and anxiety, assessed 10 weeks after aSAH, were examined as possible predictors of participation by means of linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Although patients were ADL-independent, 64 % reported one or more participation restrictions and 60 % were dissatisfied in one or more participation domains. Most commonly experienced restrictions concerned <b>housekeeping,</b> <b>chores</b> in and around the house, and physical exercise. Dissatisfaction was most often reported about outdoor activities, mobility, and work/housekeeping. The main predictors of participation restrictions as well as satisfaction with participation were cognitive complaints (subjective) (β = -. 30, p =. 03 and β = -. 40, p =. 002, respectively) and anxiety (β =. 32, p =. 02 and β = -. 34, p =. 007, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Almost two-thirds of the ADL-independent patients experienced problems of participation 6 months after aSAH. Cognitive complaints (subjective) and anxiety symptoms showed the strongest association with participation restrictions and satisfaction. Cognitive rehabilitation and anxiety-reducing interventions may help to optimize rehabilitation and increase participation after aSAH...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1966 The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to determine 1) The types, numbers and status (previously owned or newly purchased) {{of the household}} furnishings 2) The types and amounts of selected personal belongings 3) Adequacy of storage space provided 4) Selected activity patterns of a specific group of retired women living in one retirement home. The retirement home selected for the study was Terwilliger Plaza, a 342 -unit complex located in Portland, Oregon. The aforementioned information was obtained through personal interviews with {{a random sample of}} 45 residents of the retirement home [...] 25 living in studio apartments and 20 living in one-bedroom apartments. Comparisons were made between residents of the two types of apartments in each of the areas studied. The interviews revealed that {{there was no significant difference}} between residents of the two types of apartments studied relative to length of time at Terwilliger Plaza, previous residence, age and annual income. Approximately three-fourths of the total group had lived in the home the entire four years it had been in operation. The largest group lived in apartments or their own home for an average of ten years before entering the retirement home. The mean age of the occupants was 72. 4. Most of the women had an annual income of less than 5, 000. When household furnishings were considered, it was concluded that favored items included in the living-dining area by both groups of women studied were easy chairs, small tables, dining tables and chairs, television sets and table and/or floor lamps. The one-bedroom apartment occupants favored a sofa in this area. In the sleeping area, studio apartment occupants were about equally divided in their choice of single bed or convertible sofa-bed. The business centers of studio apartments often featured a secretary. Some of the one-bedroom apartments also had a secretary but more of this group had desks and chairs. Relative to status of furnishings, it can be concluded that the majority of the residents in this retirement home found it most satisfactory to include furnishings from their previous home along with a lesser number of newly purchased items. If they did buy new items, the items purchased most often were television sets, easy chairs, sofas, sofa-beds and bedroom sets. Personal belongings inventoried included outer garments, bedding, household linens, dinnerware, silverware, small electrical appliances and cooking utensils. In every category, with the exception of frequently used cooking utensils, the one-bedroom apartment occupants owned and kept in their apartments a slightly greater number of items than did the studio apartment occupants. The differences were not great enough to be significant. The occupants in both types of apartments tended to keep hobby and business supplies, coats and other clothes, chests, extra food, extra bedding, dishes, cooking utensils: and ironing boards in the storage closet in their apartments. They stored luggage, Christmas deccorations, extra boxes, out-of-season clothes, chests, photographs, personal and family papers, extra bedding, canned foods and cooking utensils in the storage space provided outside their apartments. Nearly all those interviewed were satisfied with the storage space provided. Selected activities participated in by retirement home occupants were meal preparation, meals for guests, light <b>housekeeping</b> <b>chores,</b> entertaining, hobbies, and volunteer work for the retirement home and other organizations.

40|$|In December 1999, the United States Sentencing Commission (Commission), an {{institution}} {{that had been in}} suspended animation for over a year with all seven voting seats vacant, fluttered its eyelids and came back to life. An agreement between the Senate and the White House produced seven new Commissioners: five sitting federal judges, the former General Counsel of the Commission, and a law professor. The new group began work immediately, making itself accessible in meetings with lawyers and judges around the country, exuding an air of intelligence and collegiality, and dispensing in short order with a backlog of amendments to the United States Sentencing Guidelines (Guidelines) mandated by Congress. 1 Having cleared away most of the <b>housekeeping</b> <b>chores</b> that had piled up during its long sleep, the Commission recently turned to issues of broader scope. The first major undertaking of the newly-appointed Commission has been a reexamination of economic crime sentencing. In choosing economic crime sentencing reform as its initial large project, the new Commission elected to build on a foundation laid by its immediate predecessors. Staff work on economic crime sentencing reform began in 1995. 2 In January 1997, the Commission promulgated issues for comment on economic crime sentencing reform 3 and held public hearings in 1997 and * 452 1998. 4 In January 1998, the Commission published for comment a comprehensive economic crime reform package that would have consolidated the theft and fraud guidelines, revised the loss table at the heart of both guidelines, and redefined the exasperating, but pivotal, term “loss. ” 5 In April 1998, a revised version of the package came within one vote of obtaining the unanimous approval it required. Unfortunately, no further formal action was possible in 1998 - 99 because, by the fall of 1998, the terms of all the Commissioners had expired and the vacancies remained unfilled until December 1999. At the core of the last Commission 2 ̆ 7 s economic crime package lay the redefinition of the concept of ‘loss. ’ The amount of loss inflicted by a convicted criminal is a primary determinant of sentence length for economic crimes. Yet, as will be discussed below, the current Guidelines provisions regarding the meaning of loss are a confusing patchwork. Reconsideration of the loss definition was so plainly essential to any meaningful economic crime sentencing initiative that, even after it became clear that they themselves would be unable to bring reform to fruition, the last Commission arranged for the loss redefinition so nearly passed in April 1998 to be field tested during the summer of 1998. 6 The response to the proposed redefinition by the federal judges and probation officers who participated in the field test was overwhelmingly positive. 7 Consequently, even during the 1998 - 99 hiatus with no sitting Commissioners, Commission staff, in consultation with interested outside groups, continued to work on refining the draft definition, with particular attention to feedback received during the field test. 8 The Committee on Criminal Law of the United States Judicial Conference (CLC) has been an interested and active participant throughout the Commission 2 ̆ 7 s consideration of economic crime sentencing reform. 9 In * 453 order to assist the Commission in its deliberations, the CLC drafted and, on November 9, 2000, submitted to the Commission its own economic crime sentencing reform proposal for publication for comment. 10 The CLC has built upon and refined the approach so nearly adopted in 1998. The judges recommend: (1) that the theft and fraud Guidelines be consolidated; (2) that the loss table be simplified by reducing the number of its levels and modified by decreasing sentences for some low-loss offenders while increasing sentences for some high-loss offenders; and (3) that loss be redefined. More importantly, the CLC has gone beyond general recommendations and transmitted to the Commission a specific proposal for a new loss table and draft language for a redefinition of loss. (The CLC draft of a reformed loss definition appears following this Article as Appendix A.) The purpose of this Article is three-fold. First, it explains the need for consolidation of the theft and fraud guidelines and for a revised definition of loss. Second, it introduces the CLC 2 ̆ 7 s proposed loss definition and explains, in detail, the reasoning behind the drafting choices made by the judges of the CLC when preparing this proposed new definition.
