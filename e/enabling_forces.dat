This study aimed to investigate the perceptions relating to performance management of chosen respondents at Multichoice (Pty) Ltd. A literature review was performed to identify research that was previously conducted pertaining to performance management. The literature review analysed the factors perceived to enable and inhibit performance management with the question remaining as to whether the perceptions of the sample population differ or are congruent with the literature summary. The research involved using a formal quantitative causal and explanatory design with a questionnaire being used to gather information from a sample of employees. The sample comprised of 60 employees, 20 from each category of performers, namely A players, B players and C players. Statistical techniques, namely descriptive and inferential statistics were used to extract key constructs from the raw data obtained from the questionnaires. The outcome of the research resulted in the enablers and the inhibitors of performance management at Multichoice (Pty) Ltd. These findings have been used to develop a framework which should be considered by organisations to achieve high performance. Further to this, the analysis revealed the strength of the different forces which were ranked in an attempt to determine whether the <b>enabling</b> <b>forces</b> outweigh the inhibiting forces or vice versa. The reason for this was to strengthen the <b>enabling</b> <b>forces</b> supporting the performance management systems at Multichoice (Pty) Ltd and reduce the impact of opposition to it.

40|$|The {{competitiveness}} {{of the graduate}} business education market; concerns over graduate program relevance; and decreased provincial funding are placing destabilizing pressures on the current graduate business program offerings in business schools promoting the possibility of institutional change. Despite most academic institutions embracing online education as an option to respond, Canadian AACSB accredited business schools have not moved in this direction. The purpose of this research {{study was to explore}} the reasons for the limited adoption of online education in Canadian AACSB accredited business schools. The theoretical lens framing this research study was Institutional theory. A qualitative multiple case study research design was carried out with four Canadian AACSB accredited business schools participating. The main data collection method was semi-structured interviews with senior administration and faculty. This study revealed that the constraining forces were stronger than the <b>enabling</b> <b>forces</b> towards adoption, ultimately leading to limited adoption. The <b>enabling</b> <b>forces</b> identified were: market expansion opportunities; cost and infrastructure savings; and student demand for more online education. The constraining forces identified were: the lack of face-to-face interaction; and development and delivery cost. An examination of stakeholder influence found faculty resistance, to hold the strongest influence on organizational decision making in these business schools. Faculty resistance was concentrated mainly towards fully online graduate programs with greater acceptance for the hybrid format. The Institutional theory lens helped to understand that institutional change in academic institutions is difficult, due to the isomorphic forces acting as constraining forces to institutional change. This rendered the finding that the lack of legitimacy of this delivery medium was the main reason for the limited adoption of online education. A number of significant contributions to research in the areas of online education and institutional change in academic institutions; practical implications; and suggestions for future research in this area were also provided...|$|E

Entrepreneurial behaviour holds the <b>enabling</b> <b>forces</b> for such innovative and dynamic behaviour and could also become a strategic advantage for an organization. The purpose {{of this research is}} to investigate the influence of organizational culture on entrepreneurial capital of employees. A quantitative research methodology was followed to collect the research data. The organizational culture of 185 respondent’s organizations was measured with the organizational culture assessment instrument and was classified according to the competing values model. The entrepreneurial intent, a proxy for entrepreneurial capital, of these respondents was measured with the theory of a planned behavior instrument. Sequential multiple regression analysis was used to analyse the relationship between entrepreneurial intent and organizational culture. The results confirm that an organization’s culture indirectly influences entrepreneurial capital through the antecedent of planned behaviour. This research contributes to explaining why certain organizations are more entrepreneurial than others.

The stimulation of microenterprises within this sector aims at enabling the poor towards 'self-help'. The two pillars on which microenterprise stands are empowerment and finance, yet very isolated communities, such as those in the East Sepik Province of Papua New Guinea, often lack access to such <b>enabling</b> <b>forces.</b> In the absence of other financial opportunities, they sometimes apply to donor agencies for small grant funding as a means of accessing seed capital.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to apply pragmatic and {{practical}} perspectives to the transferability of research findings by examining the potential of structuration to serve as the relationship marketing meta-theory. Design/methodology/approach – The paper revisits the advanced subjectivist critique of functionalism as the dominant research paradigm before challenging the apparent fortification of the interpretivist paradigm and, in so doing, highlights interpretivism's weaknesses when dealing with social structures. Findings – With the proposed model, relationship marketing researchers, using structuration theory, can recognize the temporal and spatial specificity – and thereby transferability – of interactions and relationships. Structuration is academically rigorous and pragmatic, because it avoids the distraction of the largely academic paradigm wars. Research limitations/implications – By addressing the often-noted spatial and temporal limitations of relationship marketing research, this research responds to calls for longitudinal research. The model offers the potential for examining historical interactions and relationships to gain insight into the constraining and <b>enabling</b> <b>forces</b> of social structures. Practical implications – The use of a multi-paradigm perspective is more pragmatic than a single paradigm investigation. Using structuration as that multi-paradigm perspective, a relationship marketing researcher can gain greater insight into the spatial and temporal specificity and transferability of research findings. Researchers thus may assess the limitations of implementing marketing practice on the basis of the findings they gain from one space and time context in a different space and time context. Originality/value – A paper discussing structuration is a rarity among marketing literature.

40|$|The United States, in {{cooperation}} with European governments and international aid organizations, has sponsored the development of independent media as {{a major component of}} both conflict interventions and democratization programs, and more recently as part of nation building efforts. This study explores the evolution and export of those dominant democratic media models and their impact on recipient communities in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Macedonia from 2000 to 2007. International donors came to see media development as a silver bullet for democratization efforts to foster freedom of speech, civil society, good governance, as well as an engaged citizenry. Donors and practitioners initially believed that institutions, once established, would function in a specific way, and coupled with assistance to professionalize and commercialize the media sector, would create or at least jump start systems similar to those in the US and Europe. Over the years, policy makers have identified the vital parts of a democratic media system, but what they have failed to fully understand is the dynamic interaction among them. Now, more than fifteen {{years after the end of}} the Bosnian war and twelve after the end of the war in Kosovo, numerous assessments by government sponsors and independent evaluators have reported success in achieving fundamental media freedoms in these countries, yet these media sectors have not demonstrated their anticipated transformative power – leaving struggling or dysfunctional organizations in the wake of donor financial retreat. This study argues that media organizations and institutions are trapped between pressures to commercialize and professionalize, which have become conflicting rather than <b>enabling</b> <b>forces</b> when combined with weak economic environments.

40|$|The {{population}} of the UK is ageing and is set {{to continue to do}} so for many years. In order to enable older adults to live independently in their own homes it is essential to understand the challenges of activities of daily living, so that designers can plan suitable environments and rehabilitation professionals can know how best to assist older adults who experience difficulties. Many older adults experience difficulties negotiating stairs and falls on stairs often lead to hospitalization. To date, little research has been undertaken to explore the biomechanical demands of stair climbing and descent, and most of the literature has focussed on younger adults. In order to provide biomechanical data relevant to an ageing population, this research investigated 84 older adults performing stair ascent and descent. The subjects were divided into three age bands, 60 +, 70 + and 80 + in order to assess changes related to increasing older age. Data were collected using an 8 camera VICON system with a custom built staircase <b>enabling</b> <b>forces</b> to be recorded from 2 Kistler force platforms. A full body biomechanical model was developed to comply with the best practice standards using VICON bodybuilder. Temporal data, joint kinematics and kinetics were produced for a full gait cycle and reported on for each age category. Subjects performed the activity with and without a handrail to explore how handrails may be of assistance. Adults in the oldest age group were found to have biomechanical changes in both stair ascent and descent. The key findings were a redistribution of joint kinetics, reducing the demands at the ankle joint and increasing the demands on the hip and knee extensors. This strategy optimises muscles groups where there are greater strength reserves in older adults. Use of a handrail improved stability and reduced the demands on the lower limbs.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a closed loop optimal control <b>enabled</b> <b>force</b> sensing technology in micromanipulation and microassembly. The developed micro-force sensor {{is based on}} a cantilevered beam structure with piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) actuating/sensing layers symmetrically bonded over its entire surfaces. In this type sensors, when an external load is applied, the deformed PVDF sensing layer detects the force signal and feed it through a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) optimal servoed controller to the PVDF actuating layer, as a result, a closed feedback loop can be formed when a balance force is generated by the actuating layer within the sensor to balance the externally applied load, making the moving tip of the highly sensitive sensor remain in its equilibrium position. Once balanced, the sensor stiffness is virtually improved, so that accurate motion control of the moving part of the sensor can be attained. Furthermore, the applied force can also be achieved from the balance force in real time. This closed loop optimal control <b>enabled</b> <b>force</b> sensors can greatly enlarge the dynamic range of the micro-force sensor and will enhance manipulability during micromanipulation/microassembly when the sensor is mounted to the end-effector. © 2005 IEEE.

40|$|In the {{established}} field of leadership studies, Relational Leadership {{is a relatively}} new and under explored view of a familiar phenomenon. Scholars conceptualise Relational Leadership differently depending upon their philosophical position, in particular whether they privilege leaders’ traits and characteristics (known as an entity perspective) or foreground the relationships and interactions that enable leadership to be accomplished (a social constructionist relational perspective). To date there have been relatively few empirical studies that research Relational Leadership from a social constructionist perspective. This thesis adds to this underdeveloped body of empirical literature. The study uses data from an in-depth ethnographic single case study comprising the executive team of a large and complex UK local authority. The study took place as members of the executive team grappled with previously unheard of economic and social challenges following the global financial crash of 2007 / 8. Data is drawn from participant observation of the executive team’s meetings over a one year period, a series of in-depth interviews with executive team members, and a contextual analysis incorporating a review of relevant press coverage during the time. The study’s research question was: How is leadership relationally accomplished? The question was subsequently operationalised through the following additional three questions: Q 1 : How are relational strategies adopted by the case study team? Q 2 : How do these relational strategies support the accomplishment of the team’s strategic task? Q 3 : What contextual factors impact and are impacted by the relational strategies that are commonly adopted within the team? Adopting a Grounded Theory method, a theory of Relational Leadership as Meaningful Co-Action is developed. Meaningful Co-Action epitomises {{the ways in which the}} group went-on-together in socially and situationally developed ways through their moment-by-moment interactions. Social processes gave rise to individual process mediated through 6 contextual constraining and <b>enabling</b> <b>forces.</b> It was adherence to relational group norms that allowed the collective accomplishment of their leadership task. The study makes empirical, methodological and practice contributions.

40|$|Background. This thesis {{examined}} facilitative and inhibitory {{issues in}} the transfer of new skills and learning to support implementation of national policy for Improving Access to Psychological Therapy (IAPT) in primary care services within the English National Health Service (NHS). The policy for IAPT had two principal implementation strands; a) development of new services in primary care and development of a new, national education and b) training programme to support delivery of effective evidence based psychological treatments for a specified range of common mental disorders; particularly depression and anxiety. There is a paucity of research on transfer of skills and learning from formal education programmes to application in healthcare practice. Methodology. A mixed methods case study design was developed to obtain quantitative and qualitative data on the experiences of IAPT therapists prior to commencing their training programme; on completion of their educational programme and again at a follow-up period. In-depth interviews were held with key policy leads that devised, developed and implemented the IAPT initiative to examine their expectations and reflections on the programme. Formal interviews were held with IAPT therapists; their managers and clinical supervisors from a single education cohort in an English region. Focus groups were also held with other IAPT therapists to examine emerging findings from the data. Results A number of themes emerged from the merged quantitative and qualitative data. Motivation to maintain fidelity {{to the work of}} being an IAPT therapist was seen as crucial. This motivation was highly related to the self-reported force of external pressures to adapt IAPT practice in line with changed NHS commissioning requirements. System feedback was seen as a unique feature of the programme and part of this feedback process centred on the role of clinical supervision in supporting the transfer of learning and continuous development of practice. Educational programmes were based on a prescribed competency model which was designed to provide core knowledge and skills to support new workers in new roles in new service providers within Primary Care. However, respondents reported high degrees of complexity, practice isolation and political and economic stressors that were not reflected in the curriculum. Therefore the role of the curriculum as a front end model to prepare practitioners for practice was questioned. Despite this, evidence existed of high levels of confidence and capability of IAPT therapists in the extension of their core educational skills. This transfer behaviour was a feature of practice when set within the context of supported supervision. Discussion on the implications from this research Implementation of new services and a new workforce (such as IAPT) within the NHS remains challenging with few significant successes. The IAPT programme has a number of unique features, such as a focus on feedback processes and clinical supervision. These <b>enabling</b> <b>forces</b> particularly those of supervision, were considered to be under threat from cost saving initiatives. Such financial pressures appear to have the potential to destabilise one of the major enabling building blocks of learning transfer. This thesis adds to the body of knowledge in workforce development and education and training in the NHS by offering a detailed case study analysis of a range of factors that can inhibit or enable transfer of learning and promote change in professional practice. There is little research in the mental health literature on the transfer of learning that takes such a comprehensive whole systems and long term perspective on this issue...|$|E
