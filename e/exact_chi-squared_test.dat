40|$|Purpose: Compare {{moderate}} oral sedation {{of pediatric}} patients using Hydroxyzine and Meperidine with either Diazepam or Midazolam in management of pediatric dental patients. Methods: Randomized, double-blind, crossover pilot study of patients 3 to 7 {{years of age}} requiring two sedation visits. Frankl and Houpt behavior scores recorded at injection time, initiation of treatment and 100 % oxygen at end of treatment. Postoperative phone call surveys conducted within eight hours and within 24 hours of discharge. Wilcoxon Signed-Rank tests, Fisher’s <b>Exact</b> <b>Chi-squared</b> <b>test</b> and 0. 10 significance level. Results: 25 subjects completed 35 sedations. Eight participants completed both treatments and demonstrated significantly higher total Houpt Scores with Diazepam at all treatment stages. Frankl scores favored Diazepam at injection time. More abnormal behavior was found with Midazolam, less memory of the visit with Diazepam, but longer sleep time with Diazepam. Conclusions: Sedation with the Hydroxyzine, Meperidine and Diazepam regimen may allow for a better overall sedation experience. Postoperative monitoring is essential. The results are promising and demonstrate {{the value of a}} larger study on sedation with Diazepam...|$|E

40|$|We study exact {{tests for}} (2 x 2) and (2 x 3) {{contingency}} tables, in particular <b>exact</b> <b>chi-squared</b> <b>tests</b> and <b>exact</b> tests of Fisher type. In practice, these tests are typically carried out without randomization, leading to reproducible results but not exhausting the significance level. We discuss {{that this can}} lead to methodological and practical issues in a multiple testing framework when many tables are simultaneously under consideration as in genetic association studies. Realized randomized p-values are proposed as a solution which is especially useful for data-adaptive (plug-in) procedures. These p-values allow to estimate the proportion of true null hypotheses much more accurately than their non-randomized counterparts. Moreover, we address the problem of positively correlated p-values for association by considering techniques to reduce multiplicity by estimating the "effective number of tests" from the correlation structure.

40|$|Introduction: The loss {{of dental}} pulp may weaken teeth, {{rendering}} them susceptible to reinfection, fracture, and subsequent tooth loss. Therefore, regeneration of pulp {{is considered an}} ideal treatment to preserve teeth. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the capacity of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) to regenerate dental pulp in canine mature permanent teeth. Methods: Pulpectomy with apical foramen enlarged to a # 80 file was performed in 16 upper premolars of 4 beagle dogs. Four experimental groups were randomly established: (1) the blood clot group, (2) the autologous DPSCs group, (3) the PRP group, and (4) the DP + PRP group (a mixture of DPSCs and PRP). Four lower premolars without any further treatment after pulpectomy were used as the control group. All teeth were sealed with mineral trioxide aggregate and composite. Twelve weeks after transplantation, the teeth were subjected to radiographic and histologic examination. Results: Twenty-four of 32 experimental root canals gained newly formed tissues. All canals with an introduction of a blood clot showed histologic evidence of vital tissue formation. Cementum-like and periodontal ligament-like tissues along the internal root canal walls were typical structures in most cases. There is no significant difference between groups with or without autologous DPSC transplantation (<b>exact</b> <b>chi-square</b> <b>test,</b> P <. 05). Conclusions: New vital tissues can be regenerated in permanent canine teeth after pulpectomy and enlargement of the apical foramen. Histologically, transplantation of DPSCs and/or PRP into root canals showed no enhancement in new tissue formation compared with inducement of a blood clot into the root canals alone. © 2012 American Association of Endodontists.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the association between Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and efficacy of screening stools submitted for C. difficile toxin assay for prevalence of VRE. Between April 2012 and February 2014, 158 stool samples submitted for C. difficile toxin to the Marmara University Microbiology Laboratory, were included in the study. Stool samples were analyzed by enzyme immuno assay test; VIDAS (bioMerieux, France) for Toxin A&B. Samples were inoculated on chromID VRE (bioMerieux, France) and incubated 24 h at 37 °C. Manuel tests and API 20 STREP (bioMerieux, France) test were used to identify the Enterococci species. After the species identification, vancomycin and teicoplanin MIC's were performed by E test and molecular resistance genes for vanA vs vanB were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Of the 158 stool samples, 88 were toxin positive. The prevalence of VRE was 17 %(n: 19) in toxin positives however, 11. 4 % in toxin negatives(n: 70). All VRE isolates were identified as Enterococcus faecium. These results were evaluated according to Fischer's <b>exact</b> <b>chi-square</b> <b>test</b> and p value between VRE colonization and C. difficile toxin positivity was detected 0. 047 (p < 0. 05). PPV and NPV were 79 % and 47 % respectively. In our study, the presence of VRE in C. difficile toxin positives is statistically significant compared with toxin negatives (p < 0. 05). Screening for VRE is both additional cost and work load for the laboratories. Therefore VRE screening among C. difficile toxin positive samples, will be cost effective for determination of high risk patients in the hospitals especially for developing countries...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) {{is the major}} {{determinant}} of preoperative morbidity and mortality for patients requiring major vascular surgery. The management of CAD in these patients is controversial. AIMS: The incidence and severity of CAD in diabetic and non-diabetic patients with Leriche syndrome was explored. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: 107 patients with Leriche syndrome were selected as major vascular occlusion and grouped according to their diabetic Status. Sex, age, dyslipidemia, obesity, hypertension, clinic cardiac status, coronary angiographic lesions and coronary revascularisation procedures were noted. MATERIAL &#x 0026; METHODS: Patients&#x 2032; demographics, intra-operative and per-operative data were recorded and compared. In every patient with Leriche syndrome scheduled for elective vascular reconstruction coronary angiography was performed. Lesions were evaluated for the percentages of stenosis. Preliminary coronary bypass or percutaneous coronary intervention was recommended for those found to have advanced or severe CAD. Results of revascularisation procedures were compared. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: <b>Chi-square</b> or Fisher <b>exact</b> <b>chi-square</b> <b>test</b> is used for conditional variables. Independent samples was analysed by using t-test. Kruskal-Wallis variance test was used if the variances are not homogeneous according to the Levene test. RESULTS: No difference was found in both groups except family history and obesity. Coronary angiographic investigation indicates that 59 &#x 0025; of DIAB group and 38 &#x 0025; of NONDIAB group patients have advanced or severe CAD which has a high probability for myocardial revascularization. Overall revascularisation rate is 37. 8 &#x 0025; in DIAB group and 45. 7 &#x 0025; in NONDIAB group (p= 0, 641). Preoperative mortality was found 2. 7 &#x 0025; in diabetics and 4. 2 &#x 0025; in non-diabetics (p= 0. 342). CONCLUSIONS: Leriche syndrome with diabetes mellitus {{is more likely to}} have advanced coronary disease than those without diabetes mellitus.

MattsonMedical and {{psychological}} responses of patients recovering from surgery were evaluated in hospital rooms with ornamental indoor plants. Three clinical studies {{were conducted in}} two hospitals with 80 thyroidectomy patients, 90 appendectomy patients, and 90 hemorrhoidectomy patients. Patients in each surgical procedure {{were randomly assigned to}} either control or plant rooms. Eight species of foliage and flowering plants were placed in the hospital rooms during the recovery period following surgery until discharge. Data collected from each patient included length of hospitalization, analgesics used for postoperative pain control, vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate), ratings of pain intensity, pain distress, anxiety and fatigue (PPAF), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Form Y- 1 (STAI-Y 1), the Environmental Assessment Scale (EAS), and the Patientâs Room Satisfaction Questionnaire (PRSQ). Effects were assessed by analysis of covariance and the <b>exact</b> <b>chi-square</b> <b>test.</b> Patients in the plant rooms had significantly more positive health outcomes than those in the control group with no plants. Patients exposed to plants experienced shorter hospitalizations, fewer intakes of postoperative analgesics, more positive physiological responses, and less pain, anxiety, and fatigue than patients in the control group. Patients with plants also felt more positively about their rooms and evaluated them with higher satisfaction as compared to those in the control group. Based on patientsâ comments, plants brightened up the room environment, reduced stress, and also conveyed positive messages of the hospital caring for patients. Findings of this study confirmed the therapeutic value of plants in the hospital environment as a noninvasive, inexpensive, and effective intervention for surgical patients in a general hospital ward. Outcomes of this study will substantially affect patientsâ and hospital administratorsâ decisions that indoor plant intervention can foster improved medical outcomes, increase satisfaction with providers, and be acceptably cost effective as compared to other alternatives...|$|R
