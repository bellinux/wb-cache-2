40|$|Abstract. Concurrent {{programming}} in object-oriented languages is a notoriously difficult task. We propose coboxes – a novel language con-cept which combines and generalizes active objects and techniques for heap structuring. CoBoxes realize a data-centric approach that guaran-tees mutual-exclusion {{for groups of}} objects. This is important for more complex data structures with invariants ranging over several objects. CoBoxes support multiple <b>entry</b> <b>objects,</b> several cooperating tasks in a cobox, and nesting of coboxes for composition and internal parallelism. Communication between coboxes is handled by asynchronous method calls with futures, which is in particular suitable for distributed program-ming. In this paper, we explain how aspects of concurrent programming can be solved by coboxes. We develop a core language for coboxes and present a formal operational semantics for this language. ...|$|R

It has two main parts, Květnice and Štěpnice. Main entry was originally from the colonnade and {{was focused on the}} main compositional axis. Today this entry is used only in exceptional circumstances and the main entrance has been moved to the area of the Honorary Auditors. The floral garden consist of three parts - Dutch and orange gardens in the north, an area of the Honorary Auditors and the southern part, where in the past were Bažantice, rabbit Hill and bird aviary. The work resolves functional use of the individual parts, their interconnection and continuity of baroque Garden. In the Dutch and orange garden is proposed restaurant which forms the dominant element of area. In addition there are proposed exhibition spaces and educational center which {{should be part of the}} gardens. <b>Entry</b> <b>object</b> is reconstructed so that it offers essential services for visitors.

5000|$|Java lacks {{compound}} value types, such as structs in C, {{bundles of}} data that are manipulated directly instead of indirectly via references. Value types can offer significant performance improvements and memory savings in some cases. [...] A typical example is Java's HashMap, which is internally implemented as an array of HashMap.Entry objects. [...] Because Java lacks value types, this array is actually an array of references (pointers) to <b>Entry</b> <b>objects,</b> which in turn contains references to key and value objects. Looking up something in the map requires inefficient double indirection. If Entry were a value type, the array could store pairs of key and value references directly, eliminating the first indirection, increasing locality and reducing memory usage and heap fragmentation. If Java further supported generic primitive types, primitive keys and values could be stored in the array directly, removing the second indirection.|$|R

The bulk of the object's energy was absorbed by the atmosphere, with a total kinetic energy before atmospheric impact estimated from infrasound and seismic measurements to be equivalent to the blast yield of a nuclear weapon in the 400-500 kiloton (about 1.4-1.8 PJ) range - 26 to 33 times as much energy as that released from the atomic bomb detonated at Hiroshima.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a technique to}} encode images for content-based access and retrieval. Potential query terms are first extracted from an image and represented in terms of multiresolution subbands. A vector quantizer structure then maps the subbands of each image object onto a set of embedded dictionaries. An algorithm is used to exploit the occurrence and query probabilities of the objects for efficient coding and retrieval. Furthermore, a new browsing tool based on multiresolution prototypes is proposed. A prototype object is associated with each dictionary <b>entry.</b> Prototype <b>objects</b> may be substituted for subband data for high quality image browsing during retrieval. 1.

40|$|When {{interfacing}} Java {{with other}} {{systems such as}} databases, programmers must often program in special interface languages like SQL. Code written in these languages often needs to be embedded in strings where they cannot be error-checked at compile-time, or the Java compiler needs to be altered to directly recognize code written in these languages. We have taken {{a different approach to}} adding database query facilities to Java. Bytecode rewriting allows us to add query facilities to Java whose correctness can be checked at compile-time but which don’t require any changes to the Java language, Java compilers, Java VMs, or IDEs. Like traditional object-relational mapping tools, we provide Java libraries for accessing individual database <b>entries</b> as <b>objects</b> and navigating among them. To express a query though, a programmer simply writes code that takes a Collection representing the entire contents of a database, iterates over each entry like they would with a normal Collection, and choose the entries of interest. The query is fully valid Java code that, if executed, will read through an entire database and copy <b>entries</b> into Java <b>objects</b> where they will be inspected. Executing queries in this way is obviously inefficient, but we have a special bytecode rewriting tool that can decompile Java class files, identify queries in the bytecode, and rewrite the code to use SQL instead. The rewritten bytecode can then be run using any standard Java VM. Since queries use standard Java set manipulation syntax, Java programmers do not need to learn any new syntax. Our system is able to handle complex queries that make use of all the basic relational operations and exhibits performance comparable to that of handwritten SQL...|$|R
