When the virtual viewpoint is {{much closer to the}} 3 D scene than the reference view (camera movement in the z-dimension), objects close to the camera will enlarge in size in the virtual viewpoint image. An object’s enlargement during DIBR means that its pixel samples in the reference view will be scattered to a larger spatial area, resulting in expansion holes.

40|$|Many {{engineering}} {{parts in}} industries are assembled by rivets, bolts, pins etc. These joints {{are more vulnerable}} to fatigue loadings and a crack is emanated. As structure is in use crack starts propagating {{over a period of}} time. Crack propagation can be obstructed by inducing a compressive residual stress zone around the vulnerable parts. Cold <b>expansion</b> <b>hole</b> (CEH) is one of the techniques used to induce compressive stress zone, by inserting a tapered pin or a large diameter ball into an undersized hole. As the oversized object is inserted into the hole, the surrounding material is elastically deformed and when the object comes out from the other side, the expanded material springs back to form tangential compressive residual stress around the hole. In most of the cases the crack origins on the surface, a good surface finish is also an important parameter for increasing the strength at the surface and stop crack emanation. However, good surface finish is not achieved by CEH. A novel technique called rotating tool cold expansion (RTCE) technique is developed where a tapered mandrel is inserted into an undersized hole besides rotating it simultaneously. The tool rotation breaks down the coarse grains into fine grain structure achieving good surface finish. In this method, RTCE is performed with three undersized diameters, namely, 9. 2, 9. 5 and 9. 9 mm diameters to a maximum of 10 mm diameter. The tool material is high speed steel and the work piece material is commercial aluminium. The induced residual stresses are measured using X-ray diffraction method and compared for three different Cold expansion holes. Due to the rotation of the tool, heat is generated because of both friction at the interface and plastic deformation. A 3 -D thermo-mechanical analysis is performed in ANSYS FEA for different values of coefficient of friction and plastic deformation rate and validated with experimental results. Compared to the degree of cold expansion through conventional techniques (upto 4 %) the proposed technique is capable to produce good results up to 8. 69 % of cold expansion.

The holes produced for the assembly is susceptible to cracks due to fatigue caused by tensile loads applied.

Cold <b>expansion</b> <b>hole</b> {{is one of the}} techniques used to induce compressive stress zone, by inserting a tapered mandrel/pin or ball into an undersized hole. A novel application of the cold expansion and surface modification of walls of the cylindrical hole is presented. Predrilled holes of different diameters in commercially available aluminum and Al- 2014 -T 6 aluminum alloy plates are cold expanded using a specially fabricated tapered tool that rotates and simultaneously traverses through the hole. The tapered tool expands the hole to the desired diameter and also stirs the internal wall of the hole. In order to understand the role of frictional heating and stirring in the cold expansion of holes three mediums, namely, dry (without cooling and lubricating), metal working fluid (cooling and lubricating) and Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles (lubricating and frictional heating) are used. The residual stress, surface roughness and hardness of the wall of the holes are measured and SEM images are captured. Significant residual stresses are induced in the material around the hole region. Significant hardness improvement with reasonable surface finish is obtained. Moreover the cold expanded holes showed considerable improvement in the fatigue life of the holes. The fatigue life is found to be directly proportional to residual stresses induced around the hole and inversely proportional to surface roughness. Hardness has a negative impact on fatigue life. The rotating tool cold expansion process is compared with conventional cold expansion process and good efficiency of cold expansion is achieved in case of Al- 2014 -T 6 aluminum alloy material using nanoparticles, in terms of fatigue life achieved. It is observed that frictional heating and the plastic deformation have combined effect on the performance of the cold expansion of cylindrical holes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAnalysis of the {{literature}} shows {{that in some cases}} existing technological methods of processing, including cold expansion, are the effective means to improve fatigue durability of structural elements with holes. The effect of cold expansion (1 − 3 %) on the stress state and fatigue durability of aluminum plates with functional holes under uniaxial cyclic loading was studied. The fatigue crack growth in the plates with a thickness t = 6 mm and width of 60 mm with a central hole diameter of 8 mm and 10 mm of aluminum alloy D 16 chТ (2024 -T 3) was investigated. Fatigue test was carried out under constant amplitude loading at stress ratio R = σmin/σmax = 0 and room temperature. Here σmin, σmax are the minimum and maximum stresses, respectively. The stress range was 147 MPa, loading frequency was 25 Hz. The mechanical properties of the alloy at room temperature were: yield strength σY = 300 MPa, tensile strength σU = 430 MPa. For all tested specimens with cold expanded holes the cracks initiation from the edges of holes on the entrance faces mandrel and from middle part for plain hole. Using the finite element method, the distribution of local residual stresses {{in the vicinity of the}} expanded hole was calculated. For specimens with cold expanded holes the least compressive stresses were near the entrance face and the largest were in the middle of the hole and near the exit face. With the increase of the cold <b>expansion</b> <b>hole,</b> the difference in values of compressive residual stress along the plate thickness is reduced. The width zone of residual compressive stresses increase with the increase of cold expansion. The dependencies of the number of cycles to crack initiation in aluminum specimens on the local maximum stress and local stresses range in the vicinity of surface hole were obtained. Cold expansion degree of 1 % increases the lifetime of the plates to the initiation of fatigue crack length of 0. 25 mm in 1. 5 - 3 times as compared with plane plates. A similar dependence is observed for cold expansion of 2 %. With further increase of cold expansion degree up to 3 % the lifetime to fatigue crack initiation is increased in 7 − 10 times as compared with plane plate. By using the finite element method, the distributions of local stress range, maximum and minimum local stress near the hole depending on the number of loading cycles and cold expansion were built. In the middle section of the specimen the local stress ratio in the second half-cycle of load decrease with increasing of distance from the edge of the hole and with the increase of cold expansion. The lowest value of local stress ratio was obtained at cold expansion degree of 3 % and it is constant across thickness of plate...|$|E

A phenomenological approach is used in which failure strain is characterized {{as a function of}} stress state and as-hot stamped condition, {{based on the results of}} an extensive experimental campaign. A range of material quench conditions are investigated, resulting in a multitude of material microstructures. Considering the framework for tailored hot stamping using in die heating to achieve different material responses, six different material quench conditions were considered in this work, ranging from fully martensitic (Vickers microhardness of 485 HV) to a mixed ferrite-bainite microstructure (185 HV). Four of the material quench conditions investigated were produced using laboratory equipment, while the remainder were obtained from tailored axial crush components that were quenched with die temperatures of 400 and 700 °C. Miniature shear, butterfly, hole <b>expansion,</b> <b>hole</b> tensile, and hemispherical dome tests were developed for fracture characterization of sheet metal and digital image correlation (DIC) techniques were used extensively in order to obtain fracture strains and strain paths for the different experiments. Notched tensile specimens were also tested, however these specimens were not used for fracture characterization, due to their non-proportional loading paths and indeterminate fracture locations. Considering fracture strain to be a function of stress state and assuming the material investigated in this work to be isotropic and von Mises yielding, the equivalent strain at fracture and stress triaxiality of each experiment was determined from DIC-measured major and minor strains. Fracture loci were then calibrated for different material quench conditions. The validity of the experimental fracture locus was probed using a number of non-proportional loading experiments, in which specimens were initially pre-strained in equi-biaxial tension, before being subjected to loading states of simple shear or uniaxial tension. Additionally, work was done to adapt and apply the experimental fracture loci to impact simulations of hot stamped components with tailored properties, requiring development of “model dependent fracture loci”. There was found to be an inverse relationship between material hardness and measured fracture strain, with the fully martensitic material quench condition (485 HV) possessing the lowest ductility, while the greatest fracture strains were measured in the samples produced through die quenching at 700 °C (185 HV). For the range of material conditions considered, the lowest fracture strains corresponded to a plane strain loading condition, while the fracture strains measured in simple shear were considerably greater. The material quench conditions, ordered in increasing ductility, are as follows (fracture strains for simple shear and plane-strain tension included in parentheses) : fully martensitic (0. 54, 0. 15), intermediate forced air quench (0. 68, 0. 22), fully bainitic (0. 90, 0. 36), 400 °C die quench (1. 01, 0. 38), and 700 °C die quench (1. 05, 0. 44) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{orbital motion}} of inspiralling and {{coalescing}} black hole binaries can be investigated {{using a variety}} of approximation schemes and numerical methods within general relativity: post-Newtonian <b>expansions,</b> black <b>hole</b> perturbation theory, numerical relativity, and the effective-one-body formalism. We review two recent comparisons of the predictions from these various techniques. Both comparisons rely on the calculation of a coordinate invariant relation, in the case of non-spinning binary black holes on quasi-circular orbits. All methods are shown to agree very well in their common domain of validity. ...|$|R
40|$|With the {{emergence}} of advanced high strength steels (AHSSs) and other light–weight materials, edge fracture {{has been one of}} the important issues evading reliable prediction using CAE tools. To study edge fracture behavior of AHSS, a comprehensive <b>hole</b> <b>expansion</b> test (HET) program has been carried out on a DP 780 sheet. Specimen with three different edge conditions (milled edge, water jet cut edge and punched edge) are manufactured and tested. Results reveal that the <b>hole</b> <b>expansion</b> ratio (HER) of the present DP 780 sheet is around 38  % for milled specimen and water jet cut specimen, and about 14  % for punched specimen. A novel method of a central hole specimen tension is also introduced for edge fracture study, showing a similar trend as found in HET. The paper briefly presents a procedure and the results for a full calibration of the DP 780 sheet for plasticity and fracture, where a hybrid testing/simulation method is used to obtain parameters for Hill 48 plasticity model and modified Mohr–Coulomb fracture model. The finite element simulation gives an accurate prediction of HER, as well as the load displacement response and specimen deflection distribution in the <b>hole</b> <b>expansion</b> tests on uncracked material. The correlation between simulation and tests on central hole specimen also turns out to be very good. The paper also presents a very interesting insight of the initiation and propagation of cracks from the hole edge during a <b>hole</b> <b>expansion</b> test by numerical simulation in comparison with testing observation. The number of final cracks are accurately predicted. Other new aspects of the present paper include an improved 3 D DIC measurement technique and a simplified analytical solution, from which a rapid estimation of displacement and hoop strain field can be made (see “Appendix 2 ”).

40|$|The {{increased}} use of fiber metal laminates (FML) in aerospace structural applications led to an investigation into whether current FML layups could be improved to provide a better response during cold expansion and riveting of holes. Static measurements of the residual strain during cold <b>expansion</b> of <b>holes</b> were made using digital image correlation. Various grades of FML as well as 2024 -T 3 aluminum were investigated with the results leading {{to the design of}} a new FML layup.

40|$|Sheet steels {{are thin}} steels with {{excellent}} formability and good strength, which have various applications in industrial production. <b>Hole</b> <b>expansion</b> tests, which measure the <b>hole</b> <b>expansion</b> ratio (HER), can represent the formability of sheet steel, especially for highly advanced strength steel. Meanwhile, {{to increase the}} accuracy of the test, estimation program is an efficient method which used to predict or examine the test result. However, the feasibility of estimation programs always has fluctuation and due to some inherent defects of programing and training methods, the simulated results from estimation programs might have some extent of differences compared with the test results. Thus, thorough analysis of these differences and accuracy improvement of estimation programs are essential. In this master thesis, five different sheet steels and seven HER estimation programs are selected to analyze the feasibility of the estimation programs. The thesis includes theoretical, experimental and discussion parts. Theoretical parts will introduce theoretical backgrounds which relate to the thesis topic. Experimental parts comprise tensile tests, <b>hole</b> <b>expansion</b> tests, HER program estimations and microscopy. Except <b>hole</b> <b>expansion</b> tests and part of tensile tests, which were conducted at SSAB Europe (Hämeenlinna), the other experiments were performed at material science department of Tampere University of Technology. The test materials were provided by SSAB. According to the test results, none of the estimation programs are feasible for all steels. However, some certain programs can predict the HER for certain sheet steel with high accuracy, for example the program 6 for DX 56 D, which showed almost the same result as the test result. Based on the fracture and microstructure analysis, the ductility of sheet steels seems to be the main factor which affects the feasibility of an estimation program. Furthermore, the input selection of estimation program can also affect the estimation accuracy. According to the analysis, ultimate tensile strength (UTS) is a possible parameter which ensures the accuracy of estimation program...|$|R
