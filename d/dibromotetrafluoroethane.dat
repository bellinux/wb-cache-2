5|$|The {{incident}} {{involved the}} accidental triggering {{of a fire}} extinguishing system which sealed two forward compartments and released Halon 2402 (freon R-114B2), <b>dibromotetrafluoroethane</b> gas into them. According to survivors, those affected by the gas release were caught off guard and {{may not have been}} alerted in time due to warning sirens sounding only after the gas had already begun pouring in. Some of the victims were reported to have been unable to turn on breathing kits before they suffocated.|$|E
2500|$|Halon was {{completely}} banned in Europe and Australia except for critical users like {{law enforcement and}} aviation, resulting in stockpiles either being destroyed via high heat incineration or {{being sent to the}} United States for reuse. Halon 1301 and 1211 are being replaced with new halocarbon agents which have no ozone depletion properties and low atmospheric lifetimes, but are less effective. Halon 2402 is a liquid agent (<b>dibromotetrafluoroethane)</b> which has had limited use in the West due to its higher toxicity than 1211 or 1301. It is widely used in Russia and parts of Asia, and it was used by Kidde's Italian branch, marketed under the name [...] "Fluobrene".|$|E
2500|$|The {{accident}} {{occurred at}} 8:30 PM local time on 8 November 2008, during the submarine's first underwater test run. The submarine's {{fire extinguishing system}} was triggered, sealing two forward compartments and filling them with freon R-114B2 gas (<b>Dibromotetrafluoroethane,</b> known as khladon in Russian). The gas, a hydrobromofluorocarbon refrigerant, {{is used in the}} Russian Navy's LOKh (lodochnaya obyemnaya khimischeskaya â€“ [...] "submarine volumetric chemical") fire suppressant system. Each compartment of a Russian submarine contains a LOKh station from which freon can be delivered into that or adjacent compartments. Freon displaces oxygen, enabling it to extinguish fires rapidly in enclosed spaces. In high concentrations, it can cause , which progresses by stages into excitation, mental confusion, lethargy, and ultimately asphyxiation.|$|E
