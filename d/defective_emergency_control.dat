Neither the operators’ monitoring nor the automatic alarming of Path 44 power flow exceeding the limit was correlated to SONGS separation scheme, {{which was a}} lack of real-time early warning against the effect of this limit violation. Otherwise, the automatic operation of the SONGS separation scheme could have been prevented by earlier <b>emergency</b> <b>control</b> actions such as manual load shedding.|$|R
40|$|A {{control room}} {{is defined as}} a {{functional}} entity with an associated physical structure, where the operators carry out the centralized control, monitoring and administrative responsibilities. <b>Emergency</b> <b>control</b> room acts as an alternative control room for the purpose of shutting down or maintaining the facility in a safe shutdown state when the main control room is uninhabitable. The mission of <b>emergency</b> <b>control</b> room is to provide the resources to bring the plant to a safe shutdown condition after an evacuation of the main control room. An evacuation of the main control room is assumed when there is no possibility to accomplish tasks involved in the shutdown except reactor trip. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present a specific approach for the design of the <b>emergency</b> <b>control</b> room of a nuclear reactor used to produce radioisotope.

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} {{some examples}} of communication and cooperation in an <b>emergency</b> <b>control</b> centre. The distribution of information {{and the distribution of}} tasks is a complex cognitive activity. In some cases, this activity is regulated by institutional rules, in other cases, the persons involved have to decide when to call upon another person, how to transfer data and how to feed back data about activities performed. For time-critical complex tasks like this, strict rule-based behaviour seems to be insufficient, as much of the cooperation and success of managing this dynamic task seem to depend upon flexibility and what we coin cognitive empathy.

30|$|In fact, all the {{blackout}} events showed that equipment along the power flow rerouting path during the dynamic process could be tripped by protection relays earlier than UFLS actions. Therefore the cascading development such as successive islanding {{could not possibly}} be interrupted by solely depending on the distributed control measures such as UFLS. Moreover, the <b>emergency</b> <b>control</b> problem should be formulated as that of {{the blackout}} defense mechanism in case of sudden loss of a key power transmission interface which although was a single transmission line in all the above cases. Therefore, the primary control objective should be to prevent cross-grid rerouting of large power flow and the follow-up uncontrolled equipment tripping and system islanding, and automatic generator tripping and load shedding triggered by the event of a sudden loss of transmission corridor is the most effective <b>emergency</b> <b>control</b> measure to prevent similar cascading outages. The economic rationality of deploying this type of <b>emergency</b> <b>control</b> can be analyzed {{from the point of view}} of risk reduction.|$|R
40|$|A general response-based {{technique}} is presented for closed-loop transient stability <b>emergency</b> <b>control.</b> It relies on E-SIME, {{derived from the}} hybrid transient stability method, SIME. E-SIME uses real-time information supposed to be furnished by phasor measurement units to predict the stability status of the power system, and, in view of an imminent instability, to design and trigger appropriate countermeasures, while continuing monitoring in order to check their effectiveness or to apply additional ones. Performance of the method in terms of accuracy and rapidity is scrutinized and illustrated on several real-world power system examples. New technical solutions and algorithms for the accurate estimation and prediction of power system quantities most relevant to the method are discussed. The observations from a recent investigation and conclusions that could prove useful for improving further the method are summarized together with some realistic timing considerations. A natural coupling of the two SIME based <b>emergency</b> <b>control</b> techniques: open-loop <b>emergency</b> <b>control</b> and E-SIME, so as to combine their complementary features is also discussed.

40|$|Power systems {{normally}} {{operate at}} their stable operating conditions where the power {{supply and demand}} are balanced. In emergency situations, the operators proceed to cut a suitable amount of loads to rebalance the supply-demand and hopefully stabilize the system. This traditional <b>emergency</b> <b>control</b> scheme results in interrupted service with severely economic damages to customers. In order to provide seamless electricity service to customers, this paper proposes a viable alternative for traditional remedial controls of power grids by exploiting the plentiful transmission facilities. In particular, we consider two <b>emergency</b> <b>control</b> schemes involving adjustment of the susceptance {{of a number of}} selected transmission lines to drive either fault-on dynamics or post-fault dynamics, and thereby stabilize the system under emergency situations. The corresponding <b>emergency</b> <b>control</b> problems will be formulated and partly solved in some specific cases. Simple numerical simulation will be used to illustrate the concept of this paper. Comment: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv: 1510. 0732...|$|R

In the process of <b>emergency</b> <b>control,</b> relaying protection and security control operate independently, perform their own functions and their function cannot replace each other. It is worth attention {{that there are two}} basic principles in the security emergency control: the necessity for failure clearing and the priority of failure clearing. This is the duty and responsibilities of relaying protection and WARP. The fault clearing is the premise of effective security control. So the function of backup protection cannot be replaced by security control [3].|$|R
