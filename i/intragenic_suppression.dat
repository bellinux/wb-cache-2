In a classic study, Francis Crick (et al.) used <b>intragenic</b> <b>suppression</b> to study the fundamental nature of the genetic code. From this study it was shown that genes are expressed as non-overlapping triplets (codons). [...] Researchers showed that mutations caused by either a single base insertion (+) or a single base deletion (-) could be [...] "suppressed" [...] or restored by a second mutation of the opposite sign, as long as the two mutations occurred in the same vicinity of the gene. This led to the conclusion that genes needed to be read in a specific [...] "reading frame" [...] and a single base insertion or deletion would shift the reading frame (frameshift mutation) {{in such a way that}} the remaining DNA would code for a different polypeptide than the one intended. Therefore, researchers concluded that the second mutation of opposite sign suppresses the original mutation by restoring the reading frame, as long as the portion between the two mutations is not critical for protein function.|$|E
50|$|A {{suppressor}} {{screen is}} used to identify suppressor mutations which alleviate or revert the phenotype of the original mutation, in a process defined as synthetic viability. Suppressor mutations {{can be described as}} second mutations at a site on the chromosome distinct from the mutation under study, which suppress the phenotype of the original mutation. If the mutation is in the same gene as the original mutation it is known as <b>intragenic</b> <b>suppression,</b> whereas a mutation located in a different gene is known as extragenic suppression or intergenic suppression. Suppressor mutations are extremely useful to define the functions of biochemical pathways within a cell and the relationships between different biochemical pathways.|$|E
40|$|Mutants of the HIS 1 {{locus of}} the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are {{suitable}} reporters for spontaneous reversion events because most reversions are topical, that is, within the locus itself. Thirteen mutations of his 1 - 1 now {{have been identified}} with respect to base sequence. Revertants of three mutants and their spontaneous reversion rates are presented: (1) a chain termination mutation (his 1 - 208, née his 1 - 1) that does not revert by mutations of tRNA loci and reverts only by intracodonic suppression; (2) a missense mutation (his 1 - 798, née his 1 - 7) that can revert by <b>intragenic</b> <b>suppression</b> by base substitutions of any sort, including a back mutation {{as well as one}} three-base deletion; and (3) a - 1 frameshift mutation (his 1 - 434, née his 1 - 19) that only reverts topically by + 1 back mutation, + 1 <b>intragenic</b> <b>suppression,</b> or a - 2 deletion. Often the + 1 insertion is accompanied by base substitution events at one or both ends of a run of A's. Missense suppressors of his 1 - 798 are either feeders or nonfeeders, and at four different locations within the locus, a single base substitution encoding an amino acid alteration will suffice to turn the nonfeeder phenotype into a feeder phenotype. Late-appearing revertants of his 1 - 798 were found to be slowly growing leaky mutants rather than a manifestation of adaptive mutagenesis. Spontaneous revertants of his 1 - 208 and his 1 - 434 produced no late-arising colonies...|$|E
40|$|We {{are using}} <b>intragenic</b> <b>suppression</b> to {{generate}} inferences about currently inaccessible conformations of the molecular motor myosin. We identified 19 unique suppressors of Dictyostelium G 680 A and G 680 V mutants {{and find that}} they are structurally and chemically restricted, suggestive of specific, compensatory mechanisms of action. Suppressors cluster in two adjacent elements of the myosin structure, {{one of which is}} dominated by substitutions that increase the volume of hydrophobic residues. The suppressors outline a general model for the mechanism of suppression of the G 680 A and G 680 V alterations. Secondary phenotypes conferred by suppressors independent of the G 680 changes demonstrate that they will be useful substrates for biochemical and genetic characterization...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe S 4 segment {{comprises}} part of {{the voltage}} sensor in Shaker K+ channels. We have used a strategy similar to <b>intragenic</b> <b>suppression,</b> but without a genetic selection, to identify electrostatic interactions of the S 4 segment that may be important in the mechanism of voltage-dependent activation. The S 4 neutralization mutations K 374 Q and R 3770 block maturation of the protein, suggesting that they prevent proper folding. K 374 Q is specifically and efficiently rescued by the second site mutations E 2930 and D 316 N, located in putative transmembrane segments S 2 and S 3, respectively. These results suggest that K 374, E 293, and D 316 form a network of strong, local, electrostatic interactions that stabilize {{the structure of the}} channel. Some other double mutant combinations result in inefficient suppression, identifying weak, presumably longrange electrostatic interactions. A simple structural hypothesis is proposed to account forthe effects of the rescued double mutant combinations on the relative stabilities of open and closed channel conformations...|$|E
40|$|Gal 4 -mediated {{activation}} of GAL gene transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires {{the interaction of}} Gal 3 with Gal 80, the Gal 4 inhibitor protein. While {{it is known that}} galactose and ATP activates Gal 3 interaction with Gal 80, neither the mechanism of activation nor the surface that binds to Gal 80 is known. We addressed this through <b>intragenic</b> <b>suppression</b> of GAL 3 C alleles that cause galactose-independent Gal 3 –Gal 80 interaction. We created a new allele, GAL 3 SOC, and showed that it suppressed a new GAL 3 C allele. We tested the effect of GAL 3 SOC on several newly isolated and existing GAL 3 C alleles that map throughout the gene. All except one GAL 3 C allele, D 368 V, were suppressible by GAL 3 SOC. GAL 3 SOC and all GAL 3 C alleles were localized on a Gal 3 homology model that is based on the structure of the highly related Gal 1 protein. These results provide evidence for allosterism in the galactose- and ATP-{{activation of}} Gal 3 binding to Gal 80. In addition, because D 368 V and residues corresponding to Gal 80 -nonbinder mutations colocalized to a domain that is absent in homologous proteins that do not bind to Gal 80, we suggest that D 368 {{is a part of the}} Gal 80 -binding surface...|$|E
40|$|In voltage-dependent Shaker K+ channels, charged {{residues}} E 293 in {{transmembrane segment}} S 2 and R 365, R 368, and R 371 in S 4 {{contribute significantly to}} the gating charge movement that accompanies activation. Using an <b>intragenic</b> <b>suppression</b> strategy, we have now probed for structural interaction between transmembrane segments S 2, S 3, and S 4 in Shaker channels. Charge reversal mutations of E 283 in S 2 and K 374 in S 4 disrupt maturation of the protein. Maturation was specifically and efficiently rescued by second-site charge reversal mutations, indicating that electrostatic interactions exist between E 283 in S 2 and R 368 and R 371 in S 4, and between K 374 in S 4 and E 293 in S 2 and D 316 in S 3. Rescued subunits were incorporated into functional channels, demonstrating that a native structure was restored. Our data indicate that K 374 interacts with E 293 and D 316 within the same subunit. These electrostatic interactions mediate the proper folding of the protein {{and are likely to}} persist in the native structure. Our results raise the possibility that the S 4 segment is tilted relative to S 2 and S 3 in the voltage-sensing domain of Shaker channels. Such an arrangement might provide solvent access to voltage-sensing residues, which we find to be highly tolerant of mutations...|$|E
40|$|F 1 Fo ATP synthases {{function}} by a rotary mechanism. The enzyme's peripheral stalk {{serves as}} the stator that holds the F 1 sector and its catalytic sites against {{the movement of the}} rotor. In Escherichia coli, the peripheral stalk is a homodimer of identical b subunits, but photosynthetic bacteria have open reading frames for two different b-like subunits thought to form heterodimeric b/b′ peripheral stalks. Chimeric b subunit genes have been constructed by substituting sequence from the Thermosynechococcus elongatus b and b′ genes in the E. coli uncF gene, encoding the b subunit. The recombinant genes were expressed alone and in combination in the E. coli deletion strain KM 2 (Δb). Although not all of the chimeric subunits were incorporated into F 1 Fo ATP synthase complexes, plasmids expressing either chimeric bE 39 -I 86 or b′E 39 -I 86 were capable of functionally complementing strain KM 2 (Δb). Strains expressing these subunits grew better than cells with smaller chimeric segments, such as those expressing the b′E 39 -D 53 or bL 54 -I 86 subunit, indicating <b>intragenic</b> <b>suppression.</b> In general, the chimeric subunits modeled on the T. elongatus b subunit proved to be more stable than the b′ subunit in vitro. Coexpression of the bE 39 -I 86 and b′E 39 -I 86 subunits in strain KM 2 (Δb) yielded F 1 Fo complexes containing heterodimeric peripheral stalks composed of both subunits...|$|E
40|$|Mutations in the fliK gene of Salmonella typhimurium {{commonly}} cause {{failure to}} terminate hook assembly and initiate filament assembly (polyhook phenotype). Polyhook mutants {{give rise to}} pseudorevertants which are still defective in hook termination but have recovered the ability to assemble filament (polyhook-filament phenotype). The polyhook mutations {{have been found to}} be either frameshift or nonsense, resulting in truncation of the C terminus of FliK. Intragenic suppressors of frameshift mutations were found to be ones that restored the original frame (and therefore the C-terminal sequence), but in most cases with substantial loss of natural sequence and sometimes the introduction of artificial sequence; in no cases did <b>intragenic</b> <b>suppression</b> occur when significant disruption remained within the C-terminal region. By use of a novel PCR protocol, in-frame deletions affecting the N-terminal and central regions of FliK were constructed and the resulting phenotypes were examined. Small deletions resulted in almost normal hook length control and almost wild-type swarming. Larger deletions resulted in loss of control of hook length and poor swarming. The largest deletions severely affected filament assembly as well as hook length control. Extragenic suppressors map to an unlinked gene, flhB, which encodes an integral membrane protein (T. Hirano, S. Yamaguchi, K. Oosawa, and S. -I. Aizawa, J. Bacteriol. 176 : 5439 – 5449, 1994; K. Kutsukake, T. Minamino, and T. Yokoseki, J. Bacteriol. 176 : 7625 – 7629, 1994).

40|$|Nuclear and {{mitochondrial}} transmission to daughter buds of Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{depends on}} Mdm 1 p, an intermediate filament-like protein localized to numerous punctate structures {{distributed throughout the}} yeast cell cytoplasm. These structures disappear and organelle inheritance is disrupted when mdm 1 mutant cells are incubated at the restrictive temperature. To characterize further the function of Mdm 1 p, new mutant mdm 1 alleles that confer temperature-sensitive growth and defects in organelle inheritance but produce stable Mdm 1 p structures were isolated. Microscopic analysis of the new mdm 1 mutants revealed three phenotypic classes: Class I mutants showed defects in both mitochondrial and nuclear transmission; Class II alleles displayed defective mitochondrial inheritance but {{had no effect on}} nuclear movement; and Class III mutants showed aberrant nuclear inheritance but normal mitochondrial distribution. Class I and II mutants also exhibited altered mitochondrial morphology, possessing primarily small, round mitochondria instead of the extended tubular structures found in wild-type cells. Mutant mdm 1 alleles affecting nuclear transmission were of two types: Class Ia and IIIa mutants were deficient for nuclear movement into daughter buds, while Class Ib and IIIb mutants displayed a complete transfer of all nuclear DNA into buds. The mutations defining all three allelic classes mapped to two distinct domains within the Mdm 1 p protein. Genetic crosses of yeast strains containing different mdm 1 alleles revealed complex genetic interactions including <b>intragenic</b> <b>suppression,</b> synthetic phenotypes, and intragenic complementation. These results support a model of Mdm 1 p function in which a network comprised of multimeric assemblies of the protein mediates two distinct cellular processes...|$|E
40|$|ATP {{hydrolysis}} and polypeptide binding, the two key {{activities of}} Hsp 70 molecular chaperones, are inherent properties of different domains of the protein. The coupling {{of these two}} activities is critical because the bound nucleotide determines, in part, the affinity of Hsp 70 s for protein substrate. In addition, cochaperones of the Hsp 40 (DnaJ) class, which stimulate Hsp 70 ATPase activity, have been proposed {{to play an important}} role in promoting efficient Hsp 70 substrate binding. Because little is understood about this functional interaction between domains of Hsp 70 s, we investigated mutations in the region encoding the ATPase domain that acted as intragenic suppressors of a lethal mutation (I 485 N) mapping to the peptide-binding domain of the mitochondrial Hsp 70 Ssc 1. Analogous amino acid substitution in the ATPase domain of the Escherichia coli Hsp 70 DnaK had a similar intragenic suppressive effect on the corresponding I 462 T temperature-sensitive peptide-binding domain mutation. I 462 T protein had a normal basal ATPase activity and was capable of nucleotide-dependent conformation changes. However, the reduced affinity of I 462 T for substrate peptide (and DnaJ) is likely responsible for the inability of I 462 T to function in vivo. The suppressor mutation (D 79 A) appears to partly alleviate the defect in DnaJ ATPase stimulation caused by I 462 T, suggesting that alteration in the interaction with DnaJ may alter the chaperone cycle to allow productive interaction with polypeptide substrates. Preservation of the <b>intragenic</b> <b>suppression</b> phenotypes between eukaryotic mitochondrial and bacterial Hsp 70 s suggests that the phenomenon studied here is a fundamental aspect of the function of Hsp 70 :Hsp 40 chaperone machines...|$|E
40|$|Using a {{strategy}} related to <b>intragenic</b> <b>suppression,</b> we previously obtained evidence for structural interactions in the voltage sensor of Shaker K+ channels between residues E 283 in S 2 and R 368 and R 371 in S 4 (Tiwari-Woodruff, S. K., C. T. Schulteis, A. F. Mock, and D. M. Papazian. 1997. Biophys. J. 72 : 1489 – 1500). Because R 368 and R 371 {{are involved in}} the conformational changes that accompany voltage-dependent activation, we tested the hypothesis that these S 4 residues interact with E 283 in S 2 in a subset of the conformational states that make up the activation pathway in Shaker channels. First, the location of residue 283 at hyperpolarized and depolarized potentials was inferred by substituting a cysteine at that position and determining its reactivity with hydrophilic, sulfhydryl-specific probes. The results indicate that position 283 reacts with extracellularly applied sulfhydryl reagents with similar rates at both hyperpolarized and depolarized potentials. We conclude that E 283 is located near the extracellular surface of the protein in both resting and activated conformations. Second, we studied the functional phenotypes of double charge reversal mutations between positions 283 and 368 and between 283 and 371 to gain insight into the conformations in which these positions approach each other most closely. We found that combining charge reversal mutations at positions 283 and 371 stabilized an activated conformation of the channel, and dramatically slowed transitions into and out of this state. In contrast, charge reversal mutations at positions 283 and 368 stabilized a closed conformation, which by virtue of the inferred position of 368 corresponds to a partially activated (intermediate) closed conformation. From these results, we propose a preliminary model for the rearrangement of structural interactions of the voltage sensor during activation of Shaker K+ channels...|$|E
40|$|Inactivation of Escherichia coli isocitrate {{dehydrogenase}} upon phosphorylation at S 113 {{depends upon the}} direct electrostatic repulsion of the negatively charged gamma-carboxylate of isocitrate by the negatively charged phosphoserine. The effect is mimicked by replacing S 113 with aspartate or glutamate, which reduce performance (kcat/K(i). isocitrat/ Km. NADP) {{by a factor of}} 10 (7). Here, we demonstrate that the inactivating effects of the electrostatic repulsion are completely eliminated by a second-site mutation, and provide the structural basis for this striking example of <b>intragenic</b> <b>suppression.</b> N 115 is adjacent to S 113 on one face of the D-helix, interacts with isocitrate and NADP+, and has been postulated to serve in both substrate binding and in catalysis. The single N 115 L substitution reduces affinity for isocitrate by a factor of 50 and performance by a factor of 500. However, the N 115 L substitution completely suppresses the inactivating electrostatic effects of S 113 D or S 113 E: the performance of the double mutants is 10 (5) higher than the S 113 D and S 113 E single mutants. These mutations have little effect on the kinetics of alternative substrates, which lack the charged gamma-carboxylate of isocitrate. Both glutamate and aspartate at site 113 remain fully ionized in the presence of leucine. In the crystal structure of the N 115 L mutant, the leucine adopts a different conformer from the wild-type asparagine. Repacking around the leucine forces the amino-terminus of the D-helix away {{from the rest of the}} active site. The hydrogen bond between E 113 and N 115 in the S 113 E single mutant is broken in the S 113 E/N 115 L mutant, allowing the glutamate side chain to move away from the gamma-carboxylate of isocitrate. These movements increase the distance between the carboxylates, diminish the electrostatic repulsion, and lead to the remarkably high activity of the S 113 E/N 115 L mutant...|$|E
40|$|Staphylococcus aureus {{is known}} to {{generate}} small colony variants (SCVs) that are resistant to aminoglycoside antibiotics and can cause persistent and recurrent infections. The SCV phenotype is unstable, and compensatory mutations lead to restored growth, usually with loss of resistance. However, the evolution of improved growth, by mechanisms that avoid loss of antibiotic resistance, is very poorly understood. By selection with serial passaging, we isolated and characterized different classes of extragenic suppressor mutations that compensate for the slow growth of small colony variants. Compensation occurs by two distinct bypass mechanisms: (i) translational suppression of the initial SCV mutation by mutant tRNAs, ribosomal protein S 5, or release factor 2 and (ii) mutations that cause the constitutive activation of the SrrAB global transcriptional regulation system. Although compensation by translational suppression increases growth rate, it also reduces antibiotic susceptibility, thus restoring a pseudo-wild-type phenotype. In contrast, an evolutionary pathway that compensates for the SCV phenotype by activation of SrrAB increases growth rate without loss of antibiotic resistance. RNA sequence analysis revealed that mutations activating the SrrAB pathway cause upregulation of genes involved in peptide transport and in the fermentation pathways of pyruvate to generate ATP and NAD(+), thus explaining the increased growth. By increasing {{the growth rate of}} SCVs without the loss of aminoglycoside resistance, compensatory evolution via the SrrAB activation pathway represents a threat to effective antibiotic therapy of staphylococcal infections. IMPORTANCE Small colony variants (SCVs) of Staphylococcus aureus are a significant clinical problem, causing persistent and antibiotic-resistant infections. However, SCVs are unstable and can rapidly evolve growth-compensated mutants. Previous data suggested that growth compensation only occurred with the loss of antibiotic resistance. We have used selection with serial passaging to uncover four distinct pathways of growth compensation accessible to SCVs. Three of these paths (reversion, <b>intragenic</b> <b>suppression,</b> and translational suppression) increase growth at the expense of losing antibiotic resistance. The fourth path activates an alternative transcriptional program and allows the bacteria to produce the extra ATP required to support faster growth, without losing antibiotic resistance. The importance of this work is that it shows that drug-resistant SCVs can evolve faster growth without losing antibiotic resistance...|$|E
40|$|Cells are {{continuously}} {{challenged by}} various sources of DNA damage that {{can contribute to}} cancer formation if not appropriately repaired. To cope with this threat, cells have conserved mechanisms called the DNA damage checkpoints that sense damaged DNA, stop the cell cycle, and upregulate DNA repair. Central players in these checkpoints are the PI 3 K-like kinases ATM and ATR (S. c. Tel 1 and Mec 1). Mec 1 senses single stranded DNA (ssDNA) that is exposed at stalled replication forks and activates the S phase checkpoint. However, ssDNA, which is generated at the lagging strand during normal replication, does not cause detectable checkpoint activation. It is unknown how Mec 1 is regulated in S phase. To study this, we took advantage of a mutant allele of MEC 1, mec 1 - 100, which is proficient for the G 2 DNA damage checkpoint, but is compromised in G 1 -S and intra-S-phase checkpoints. In {{the first part of}} this thesis we aimed at identifying regulatory factors. We screened for spontaneous survivors on a lethal dose of the replication fork-stalling agent hydroxyurea (HU) for mec 1 - 100 cells. We mapped additional mutations in mec 1 - 100 or mutations in either PPH 3 or PSY 2, which form a highly conserved phosphatase (PP 4) complex. In a second, more unbiased, high-throughput screen we combined mec 1 - 100 with a collection of 1525 gene deletions involved in chromatin processes and scored double mutants for HU sensitivity. pph 3 Δ and psy 2 Δ were among the top mec 1 - 100 suppressor hits, confirming a strong genetic interaction. Suppression by pph 3 Δ was correlated with the phosphorylation of the downstream kinase Rad 53. However, it did not depend exclusively on Rad 53, because residual suppression of mec 1 - 100 by pph 3 Δ could also be observed in rad 53 Δ cells. We tested whether Psy 2 -Pph 3 might regulate Mec 1 directly, and found a physical interaction between Psy 2 and Ddc 2 -Mec 1. Moreover, we found that a phosphorylation site within Mec 1 (S 1991) is downregulated in mec 1 - 100 cells and restored when Pph 3 is also lost. However, we were unable to demonstrate that Pph 3 dephosphorylates Mec 1 directly in vitro. Phosphorylation required both Mec 1 kinase activity and Rad 53. Thus, we speculate that Mec 1 phosphorylation is achieved through Rad 53, which is in turn regulated by Pph 3, indicating the existence of a feedback loop from Rad 53 back to Mec 1. Mutation of the phosphorylation site renders cells sensitive to the radiomimetic drug Zeocin, indicating an important role in the survival of DNA damage. Finally, we applied quantitative phosphoproteomics to identify Mec 1 and Pph 3 targets. We found that the levels of the majority of the phosphopeptides that are affected by a tel 1 Δ mec 1 - 100 mutation but not by rad 53 Δ can be rescued due to additional deletion of PPH 3. The data presented here support a model in which Pph 3 is a major regulator of Mec 1 signaling. In a second part mec 1 - 100 was further characterized in order to understand the mechanism by which its two point mutations outside of the catalytic domain (F 1179 S, N 1700 S) cause defects in the replication checkpoint. We find that the mutations leave kinase activity in vitro, oligomerization and Ddc 2 -Mec 1 interaction intact. Genetic analysis shows that mec 1 - 100 is additive, rather than epistatic with mutation or deletion of any of the canonical checkpoint activating proteins Ddc 1, Dna 2, Dpb 11, Rad 24, Mrc 1, Rad 9, Tel 1 or Chk 1. Thus, we conclude that mec 1 - 100 does not impair function of any of these proteins. We hypothesized that the mutated region might constitute a regulatory domain that is bound by a yet unknown factor. IP experiments followed by mass spectrometry analysis did not show reproducibly decreased interaction of any protein. Additional detailed biochemical analysis is needed to fully understand the mechanism of the two mec 1 - 100 mutations. We further characterize intragenic mec 1 - 100 suppressor mutations by mapping them to a homology model. While some mutations reside within the kinase domain, and could influence catalytic activity, others might as well be involved protein-protein interactions. We asked whether suppression would involve Rad 24 dependent Mec 1 activation. Interestingly, we find that suppression by mutations in residues that might make protein-protein contacts completely requires Rad 24. Other suppressor mutations relied less on Rad 24. Thus, we conclude that <b>intragenic</b> <b>suppression</b> of mec 1 - 100 HU sensitivity employs at least two different mechanisms: one that is Rad 24 -dependent and a second that is Rad 24 –independent. These unpublished results will help in understanding Mec 1 function and regulation once structural data is available. The third experimental part resolves the role of the RecQ helicase Sgs 1 in replication checkpoint signaling. It was shown before that Sgs 1 and Mec 1 synergistically contribute to replication fork stabilization under replication stress. Both interact with the ssDNA binding protein RPA. Here, we created a mutant, sgs 1 -r 1, which lacks the RPA interaction domain. While sgs 1 -r 1 is proficient to stabilize stalled forks under replication stress, it is synthetic lethal with mus 81 Δ, slx 4 Δ, slx 5 Δ and slx 8 Δ. These could provide alternative means to recover stalled forks by resolving crossover structures, DNA repair or break induced replication.. Sgs 1 was previously shown to promote Rad 53 activation in a manner independent of its helicase activity. We show here that Sgs 1 checkpoint function requires the R 1 domain. Mec 1 phosphorylates Sgs 1 in this domain and Sgs 1 phosphorylation allows its binding to Rad 53 in vitro and in vivo. We thus propose that Sgs 1 serves as a mediator in checkpoint signaling by recruiting Rad 53 to stalled replication forks for activation. This work provides new insights into Mec 1 signaling by elucidating the checkpoint function of Sgs 1 and defining Psy 2 -Pph 3 as a major regulator of this pathway. ...|$|E
