5000|$|Ester {{names are}} derived from the parent alcohol and the parent acid, where the latter may be organic or inorganic. Esters derived from the {{simplest}} carboxylic acids are commonly named according to the more traditional, so-called [...] "trivial names" [...] e.g. as formate, acetate, propionate, and butyrate, {{as opposed to the}} IUPAC nomenclature methanoate, ethanoate, propanoate and butanoate. Esters derived from more complex carboxylic acids are, on the other hand, more frequently named using the systematic IUPAC name, based on the name for the acid followed by the suffix -oate. For example, the ester <b>hexyl</b> <b>octanoate,</b> also known under the trivial name hexyl caprylate, has the formula CH3(CH2)6CO2(CH2)5CH3.|$|E
40|$|Lipolytic fungi we {{isolated}} from the soil and food samples using a selective isolation medium. The isolated fungal cultures were screened for found to produce maximum lipase. The fungus Rhizopus arrhizus (isolate: 52) was found to produce maximum lipase. The fermentation medium M 5, consisting of (g/dm 3) :- olive oil, 20; yeast extract 1. 0; magnesium sulphate heptahydrate 0. 25; calcium carbonate, 5. 0 {{was found to be}} the best medium for lipase formation by Rhizopus arrhizus. The cultural conditions like medium composition, pH, aeration rate and incubation temperature were optimized for the production of the intracellular lipase by Rhizopus arrhizus in sake flasks. The optimization of the fermentation conditions resulted in about three fold increase in the production of lipases. This optimized medium gave 13. 5 g/dm 3 fungal biomass with 325 lipase units/g dry mycelium and bout 2. 4 units extracellular lipase per cm 3 of the broth. The fermentation was also carried out in 18 dm 3 stirred fermenter and 4 dm 3 airlift production. The airlift fermenter was found to be especially suitable for the intracellular lipase production. In it, the fungus Rhizopus arrhizus produced 375 units lipase per gram mycelium and 14. 2 g mycelium per dm 3 medium. In stirred fermenter,, however, both fungal biomass and intracellular lipase activity were comparatively low. Rhizopus arrhizus was also cultured in solid substrate fro extracellular lipase production. Different agricultural by products such as wheat bran, gram bran, rice husk, soybean meal and rice bran were evaluated for lipase production. A mixture of wheat bran and soybean meal, however, was found to be the best substrate. Additives like olive oil and the egg yolk emulsion increased lipase production. The extracellular and intracellular lipase of the mould Rhizopus arrhizus were used for the biocatalysis of esterification reactions. Free excellular lipase showed very low esterification activity (28 esterification units/g) whereas the celite immobilized lipase catalyzed synthesis of <b>hexyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> at the rate of 51 micromoloe/min/gram. Mycelial lipase of Rhizopus arrhizus, however, was very active in organic media and performed the synthetic work efficiently. In n-hexane, at 30 oC the mycelial lipase of Rhizopus arrhizus Catalyzed the synthesis of <b>hexyl</b> <b>octanoate</b> at a rate of 92 micromoles/min/gram mycelium. The mycelial lipase of Rhizopus arrhizus was also used for the production of fragrant esters from the fusel oil and terpene alcohols. Geranyl butyrate and butyrate of fusel oil were manufactured using a packed column reactor. In case of the fusel oil, ester yield of 87...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to characterise the aroma {{fraction}} of Italian distillates from apples typical of the Province of Sassari in the northern region of Sardinia (Malus pumila, L. cvs. Miali and Appio) in comparison to some international obtained in the northern region of Trentino–Alto Adige (M. pumila, L. cvs. Renetta del Canada (Reinette du Canada or Canadian Rennet), Golden Delicious, Royal Gala, Morgenduft and Gravenstein). The distillates producted in Sardinia were obtained from the same producer over four years, while those from Trentino–Alto Adige by two distilleries over one year, both following the same production process. Analyses of the aroma fraction were performed by HRGC–FID and HRGC–MS techniques, with direct injection in GC of full proof distillates. Evaluation of the data by statistical analysis (ANOVA and Principal Component Analysis) revealed that the variables ethyl <b>octanoate,</b> <b>hexyl</b> 2 -methylbutyrate, 1 -hexanol, benzaldehyde and furfural are able to distinguish between the varieties. In the case of the Sardinian varieties the variables 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol, total aldehydes, ethyl acetate and 6 -methyl- 5 -hepten- 2 -ol are dependent from the year of production...|$|R
