25|$|What <b>I</b> <b>Would</b> <b>Do</b> If I Were The Prime Minister. Maclean's, September 4, 2006.|$|E
25|$|I regret nothing: 1970, the abductions, the prison, the suffering, nothing. I {{did what}} I had to do. Placed before the same {{circumstances}} today, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> {{exactly the same}} thing. I will never deny what I did and what happened. It was not a youthful indiscretion.|$|E
25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E
60|$|RUTH. [Bending {{a little}} {{forward to the}} jury] <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>done</b> the same for him; <b>I</b> <b>would</b> indeed.|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>do</b> that (if I were you). (suggestion, or implied {{conditional}} action) ...|$|R
60|$|ANN. [earnestly] Oh, {{how wrong}} you are! <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>done</b> {{anything}} for you.|$|R
25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do...</b> at Number 3. I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, Singer {{stated that}} Superman Returns {{was made for}} [...] "Perhaps more of a female audience. It wasn't what it needed to be, I guess." [...] Singer stated {{that he would have}} cut about the first quarter off of the film and started it with [...] "the jet {{disaster}} sequence or something. I could have grabbed the audience a little more quickly. I don't know what would have helped. Probably nothing. If I could go again, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> an origin. I would reboot it." ...|$|E
500|$|Lincoln's reply {{would become}} famous, {{much more so}} than the prayer that {{provoked}} it. [...] "My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union." [...] Lincoln's statement angered abolitionists; William Seward's wife Frances complained to her husband that Lincoln had made it seem [...] "that the mere keeping together a number of states is more important than human freedom." [...] Greeley felt Lincoln had not truly answered him, [...] "but I'll forgive him everything if he'll issue the proclamation". When Lincoln did, on September 22, Greeley hailed the Emancipation Proclamation as a [...] "great boon of freedom". According to Williams, [...] "Lincoln's war for Union was now also Greeley's war for emancipation." ...|$|E
5000|$|Paul the Apostle {{wrote of}} this {{condition}} in the Epistle to the Romans , : For that which I do I allow not: for what <b>I</b> <b>would,</b> that <b>do</b> <b>I</b> not; but what I hate, that do I. ... For I {{know that in}} me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not. For the good that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not: but the evil which <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not, that <b>I</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
60|$|Answ. O no; <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>do</b> that willfully, despitefully, and knowingly, not {{for all the}} world.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have the}} {{disposition}} of a thoat, Uthia," [...] she said. [...] "Forgive me! I love you {{and there is nothing}} that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>do</b> for you and nothing <b>would</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> to harm you. Again, as I have so often in the past, I offer you your freedom." ...|$|R
500|$|As a child, Downey was [...] "surrounded by drugs". His father, a drug addict, allowed Downey to use {{marijuana}} at age six, {{an incident}} which {{his father has}} said he now regrets. Downey later stated that drug use became an emotional bond {{between him and his}} father: [...] "When my dad and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> drugs together, it was like him trying to express his love for me in the only way he knew how." [...] Eventually, Downey began spending every night abusing alcohol and [...] "making a thousand phone calls in pursuit of drugs".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} on February 17, 2011, with Entertainment Weekly, Nathan Fillion joked that: [...] "If I got $300 million from the California Lottery, the first thing <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> is buy the rights to Firefly, make it on my own, and distribute it on the Internet". [...] This quickly {{gave rise to a}} fan-run initiative to raising the funds to purchase the rights. On March 7, 2011, the organizers announced the closure of the project due to lack of endorsement from the creators, with $1 million pledged {{at the time it was}} shut down.|$|E
500|$|Mays {{said that}} she [...] "had fun singing," [...] but found the {{experience}} [...] "terrifying," [...] as she had never given a musical performance on camera before. She derided her choreography skills, and elaborated: [...] "I was so nervous that day. I had to keep eating bread and toast because my stomach was so sick. But {{it was an interesting}} experience. It was definitely a challenge for me. Of course if they ask me to do it again, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> it again. But I’m not going to go begging them for it." ...|$|E
50|$|I {{will lead}} by example, never {{requiring}} a Soldier to attempt any task <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>do</b> myself.|$|R
5000|$|What have I {{done for}} you, England, my England?What is there <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>do,</b> England my own? ...|$|R
6000|$|Anthea {{smiled at}} him curiously. [...] "Well," [...] she said, [...] "I may not have very much money, after all--and, if I had, {{is there any reason}} why you should be willing to give up more than <b>I</b> <b>would?</b> <b>Does</b> it matter so very much that I may, perhaps, be a little richer than you are?" ...|$|R
500|$|Taborn has {{commented on}} the {{similarities}} and differences in his playing on piano and electronic instruments. Comparing his accompaniments on piano and Fender Rhodes, he said that: I play some of the same chords on the piano, but there are definitely things <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> on the piano because it's a more transparent instrument that I wouldn't do on the Rhodes. [...] The Rhodes is so strong that when you play something on it, it really can dictate, because it's louder and the timbre is much more opaque. So you leave more holes. On the piano, I would maybe play more sustain chords.|$|E
500|$|In the 9th grade, Dahl began {{hanging around}} a local {{underground}} radio station, KPCC-FM, {{in his home}} state of California. At the age of sixteen, after he starting working at the radio station full-time, he unofficially dropped out of high school. Dahl later explained, [...] "I convinced my parents and the school that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> an independent work-study thing. I never got around to it." [...] At the age of eighteen, he obtained his GED and briefly married a woman he met after she called him on-air to request Suzanne, a song by Leonard Cohen which told a tale of a troubled relationship. Dahl later explained his short-lived marriage by commenting, [...] "I should have paid more attention to that song." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2000 Apple Records {{released}} a thirtieth anniversary {{edition of the}} album and Harrison actively participated in its promotion, giving an interview during which he reflected on the work: [...] "It's just something that was like my continuation from the Beatles, really. It was me sort {{of getting out of}} the Beatles and just going my own way... it was a very happy occasion." [...] He commented on the production: [...] "Well, in those days it was like the reverb was kind of used a bit more than what <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> now. In fact, I don't use reverb at all. I can't stand it... You know, it's hard to go back to anything thirty years later and expect it to be how you would want it now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O yes, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>done</b> that;--and so did Miss Snow. But <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{have kept}} my box locked. She {{should never have}} seen my letters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An opera--glass!--no!--what <b>do</b> {{you suppose}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be <b>doing</b> with an opera-glass?" [...] Here he turned impatiently toward the stage.|$|R
60|$|CATHERINE. You {{could have}} annexed Servia and made Prince Alexander Emperor of the Balkans. That's what <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>done.</b>|$|R
500|$|Both Rodriguez and Tarantino {{have said}} that they are {{interested}} in making a sequel to Grindhouse. Tarantino said that he wants to shoot an [...] "old-school Kung Fu movie in Mandarin with subtitles in some countries, and release a shorter, dubbed cut in others" [...] for his segment. It has also been reported by Rotten Tomatoes that Edgar Wright may expand Don't into a feature film. According to Eli Roth, he and Wright have discussed the possibility of pairing Don't with Thanksgiving for a Grindhouse sequel. Roth is quoted as saying [...] "We're talking to Dimension about it. I think they're {{still trying to figure out}} Grindhouse 1 before we think about Grindhouse 2, but I've already been working on the outline for it and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> it in a heartbeat." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Feeling This" [...] was {{the first}} track that was {{recorded}} for Blink-182 in early 2003. On {{the first day of}} pre-production on the album, bassist Mark Hoppus asked an engineer to explain Pro Tools to him, as it {{was the first}} time the band would record their music digitally. He began recording guitar and bass parts and experimenting with the software. When guitarist Tom DeLonge and drummer Travis Barker arrived, they too began adding new tracks to the project. The song was written in one day. [...] "I think if I sit there and try to analyze everything, what would be cool here or there, I just feel like I get so far away from what <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do,</b> and I think your gut instinct is usually the best thing," [...] said Barker at the time.|$|E
500|$|Talk of {{a canopy}} or halo {{to protect the}} driver was {{accelerated}} by the fatal Formula One accident that killed Jules Bianchi in October 2014 and an incident where Justin Wilson was fatally struck {{in the head by}} debris during an IndyCar race in August 2015. In particular, following Wilson's death, Allmendinger stated that he would [...] "never again" [...] run open-wheel cars, adding [...] "The only way <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> it is if they put in a closed cockpit over the car and tested it and they thought that was a good direction in safety then I might think about doing it again." [...] As a result, several major open-wheel series have implemented cockpit protection systems, with Formula One, Formula Two, and Formula Three all planning to introduce the halo for the 2018 motorsport season.|$|E

6000|$|... "Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>would.</b> There {{is nothing}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>do</b> for her. Now will {{you let me}} see her just once again, and have one other chance?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} be afraid. I shall do nothing {{elsewhere}} that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>do</b> here, and nothing anywhere without telling you." ...|$|R
500|$|Priyanka Chopra {{was cast}} as series protagonist Alex Parrish, {{the result of}} a talent holding deal with ABC Studios which {{required}} the company to develop a starring project for her or cast her in an existing project for the 2015 television season. ABC casting executive Keli Lee had long tried to persuade Chopra to perform on television in the United States. When the actress began considering U.S. TV, Lee learned that Chopra had been approached by another studio: [...] "I said , 'No, you can't make this deal elsewhere. You're coming here. And I'm flying to India. Lee went to India and convinced Chopra to accept ABC's offer. The actress said about Lee: [...] "I told her, the only way <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> it is if you find me a show and a path which first will put me in the same position that I am in India".|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} the music video was a joint {{collaboration}} between Gaga and Lawrence. Originally, the video {{was going to be}} shot in New York City, with more elaborate sets, including sets outdoors. The idea was scrapped, however, for budgetary reasons: [...] the budget for the video was low and there was no product placement. Because of Gaga's schedule, the video was shot in Los Angeles over a two-day period. Lawrence described Gaga's work ethic and creativity during the video shoot: [...] "She loves the art form of music videos and she is a real creative partner and has great ideas and really cool and unique tastes. She has a great team working with her as well, helping build really fantastic things that she wears. She works hard, she shows up on time and she's pretty spontaneous ... it was great ... if she had a new song and wanted to do something, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> it in a second. She was really fun to work with." ...|$|E
500|$|Through {{the early}} 19th century, Thompson {{continued}} to trade furs throughout the Kootenay region for the North West Company, {{and for the}} few years {{when he had a}} total monopoly over the Canadian fur trade west of the Rockies, he outlawed alcoholic drinks altogether. He was known to have written [...] "I had made it a law to myself that no alcohol should pass the mountains in my company". When two of Thompson's trading partners tried to make him take two barrels of rum to Kootanae House, Thompson [...] "placed the two kegs on a vicious horse and by noon the kegs were empty and in pieces, the horse rubbing his load against the rocks {{to get rid of it}} … I told them what I had done, and that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> the same to every keg of alcohol." [...] Of course, wine, beer, rum and other intoxicating drinks were imported in time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{resolved}} to tell you. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>do</b> it till that other woman {{had left the}} house. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not have her by to see your anger." ...|$|R
