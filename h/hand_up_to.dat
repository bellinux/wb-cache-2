Things get more embarrassing when Guy also volunteers, and asks why Caroline is sitting next to Mac when she is Guy's fianc√©e. A unconscious patient lies on an operating table. Guy touches her breasts, takes pictures of her naked body under the blanket, and kisses her. Caroline alleges that the patient is transgender, which repels Guy. Sue White then appears in a tutu, claiming that the patient is stalking Mac, and repeating the assertion that the patient is transgender.|$|E

25|$|The {{force had}} navigated fairly far up river {{when they came}} under {{unexpected}} fire from Spanish Florida. The British soon silenced the fire, but Phillott decided to retreat as the river ahead was narrow (only 30 to 40 yards wide), with commanding heights and houses to their rear. During the withdrawal, the expedition was exposed to harassing fire for over ten hours. In all, the expedition cost the British three men killed and 15 wounded. Bartholomew, of Erebus, was hit four times. He took his first hit {{in his head and}} then a second ball hit his middle finger and thumb when he put his <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> feel the first wound. He was also hit in the neck and throat. Phillott too was wounded twice.|$|E

500|$|Star Wars is {{frequently}} referenced in 30 Rock, {{beginning with the}} pilot episode where Tracy Jordan is seen shouting {{that he is a}} Jedi. Liz Lemon admits to being a huge fan of Star Wars, saying that she had watched it many times with Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit), and saying she dressed up as the Star Wars character Princess Leia during four Halloweens. Fey, a fan of Star Wars herself, said that the weekly Star Wars joke or reference [...] "started happening organically" [...] when the crew realized that they had a Star Wars reference [...] "in almost every show". Fey said that from then on [...] "it became a thing where [...] tried to keep it going", and that even though they could not include one in every episode, they still had a [...] "pretty high batting average". Fey attributed most of the references to Robert Carlock, who she described as [...] "the resident expert". In this episode, Star Wars is referenced twice: once when Liz tells Floyd that she and Pete are watching the movies on the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies list, but they only own Star Wars and Tootsie so they keep watching those two films. It is again referenced during Tracy's dream, when Thomas Jefferson holds his <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Tracy and says [...] "May the Force be with you".|$|E

The Canadian Paralympic Committee defined this classification as [...] "Up to approximately 3-5% functional vision." [...] This classification is borrowed by some other sports, including blind golf who also define the class as [...] "From ability to recognise {{the shape of a}} <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> visual acuity of 2/60 [...] or visual field of less than 5 degrees". Para-alpine skiing sport specific versions of this definition include one by the Australian Paralympic Committee which defined this classification as this classification as [...] "Athletes with some partial vision or the ability to recognise the shape of a hand but have a field of vision less than five degrees."

2500|$|One {{significant}} {{finding of}} modern studies {{is that a}} person's brain seems to commit to certain decisions before the person becomes aware of having made them. Researchers have found delays of about half a second (discussed in sections below). With contemporary brain scanning technology, other scientists in 2008 were able to predict with 60% accuracy whether subjects would press a button with their left or right <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 10 seconds before the subject became aware of having made that choice. These and other findings have led some scientists, like Patrick Haggard, to reject some forms of [...] "free will". To be clear, no single study would disprove all forms of free will. This is because the term [...] "free will" [...] can encapsulate different hypotheses, each of which {{must be considered in}} light of existing empirical evidence.|$|E
2500|$|With Santorum {{suspending}} his campaign, Gingrich saw a {{new hope}} of reasserting {{himself as the}} conservative alternative to Romney. His campaign had been scaling down since his March 24 defeat in the Louisiana primary and was $4.3 million in debt {{by the end of}} March. But now it began concentrating on the Delaware primary hoping a win there would be a game changer. The Adelson family that had already supported Gingrich heavily through the [...] "Winning Our Future" [...] super PAC gave another $5 million in late march bringing the PAC's cash on <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> $5.8 million. But even with all the resources of the Gingrich campaign concentrated in Delaware he still lost the state with 29.4 percent to Romney. On May 2 he officially suspended his campaign. Gingrich won two contest (South Carolina and Georgia) nineteen delegate allocating congressional districts. More than 2.4 million people voted for him and he secured a total of 131 delegates before suspending his campaign. He could only show plurality in two states and was therefore not going to appear on the first ballot nominating the Republican candidate for president at the National Convention.|$|E

2500|$|During his 1993 {{campaign}} for governor, Allen vowed to reform Virginia's welfare system, stating that [...] "Our obligation {{as a society}} {{is to provide a}} <b>hand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> those in need, rather than a handout... Welfare is not to be a permanent status for anyone in life." [...] At the time welfare caseloads climbed 36 percent from 1988 while one out of twelve Virginians were receiving food stamps. [...] In March 1995, after an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of support, Allen signed his welfare reform bill propelling Virginia ahead of the national welfare reform effort, [...] Among the key provisions outlined in the bill, the Virginia Initiative for Employment Not Welfare (VIEW) limited Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) benefits for welfare recipients to two years while recipients are required to work within ninety days of receiving benefits. [...] Following VIEW's implementation, welfare caseloads decreased 33 percent, from 73,926 families in March 1995 to 49,609 families in July 1997. [...] In areas where VIEW existed for twelve months, 74 percent were employed versus only 31 percent nationally,. [...] According to the Virginia Department of Health and Human Resource's 1996 annual report, VIEW saved taxpayers 24 million dollar in its first year of existence; with an addition to federal welfare money, the savings total over the following two years comes to just over $70million ...|$|E
