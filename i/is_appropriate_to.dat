5|$|The idea of Masonic brotherhood {{probably}} descends from a 16th-century {{legal definition}} of a brother as one who has taken an oath of mutual support to another. Accordingly, Masons swear at each degree to keep the contents of that degree secret, and to support and protect their brethren unless they have broken the law. In most Lodges the oath or obligation is taken on a Volume of Sacred Law, whichever book of divine revelation <b>is</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> the religious beliefs of the individual brother (usually the Bible in the Anglo-American tradition). In Progressive continental Freemasonry, books other than scripture are permissible, a cause of rupture between Grand Lodges.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} in the High Court decided that {{although there was no}} right at common law to have publicly provided legal representation in all cases, in some cases representation <b>is</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> ensure a fair trial. Although judges no longer have the power to appoint counsel for an accused, since that function has been largely taken over by legal aid agencies, a trial judge should use their power to adjourn a case if it is in the interests of fairness that an accused have representation, which would encourage the legal aid agencies to provide counsel.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to his defiance of society in matters of his own relationships, Carleton is tasked with supervising his niece Lucilla. He must ensure {{that she is not}} drawn into a scandal, ruining her prospects of marriage, a role Heyer often gives to her heroes. It is rare that her heroines are given the same responsibility, but in this novel Annis chooses to become involved in shepherding Lucilla through society. Like the hero, the heroine ignores the standards of propriety when she chooses, yet also shelters Lucilla from following her example, as Annis thinks the younger woman lacks the experience to properly judge when it <b>is</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> disregard society's mores. Annis's age, and the life experience she has gained, give her a greater ability to manipulate the social standards of her time than a young ingenue. As in Heyer's other novels, her word choice frequently highlights the fact that the heroine's behavior diverges from the socially accepted feminine ideal of the Regency period. Rather than repel others, the unwillingness to conform to the expected behavioural norms endears the heroine to the hero.|$|E

5|$|Not {{only does}} SCI present {{children}} and adolescents {{with many of the}} same difficulties adults face, it affects the development of their sexuality. Although substantial research exists on SCI and sexuality in adults, very little exists on the ways in which it affects development of sexuality in young people. Injured {{children and adolescents}} need ongoing, age-appropriate sex education that addresses questions of SCI as it relates to sexuality and sexual function. Very young children become aware of their disabilities before their sexuality, but as they age they become curious just as able-bodied children do, and it <b>is</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> provide them with increasing amounts of information. Caregivers help the child and family prepare for transition into adulthood, including in sexuality and social interaction, beginning early and intensifying during adolescence. Parents need education about the effects of SCI on sexual function so that they can answer their children's questions.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} Polish literature {{dates back}} to the 12th century, when Poland's official language was Latin.

The most vivid example is Gallus Anonymus, a foreign monk and the first chronicler who described Poland and its territories.|$|E

He also wrote “Kissinger was responsible for the killing of thousands of people, including Sheik Mujibur Rahman”.|$|E
25|$|Another serious {{objection}} is {{that workers}} in No Collapse interpretations have produced {{no more than}} elementary models based on the definite existence of specific measuring devices.

They have also assumed, even when describing the behaviour of macroscopic objects, that it <b>is</b> <b>appropriate</b> <b>to</b> employ models in which only a few dimensions of Hilbert space are used to describe all the relevant behaviour.|$|E

This leads Meliboeus to remind Corydon {{that he used to}} tell Amyntas to abandon his compositions and to concentrate on his agricultural duties. However, Corydon says that times have now changed: there is a new divine emperor.|$|E
25|$|After excavation, {{hot water}} and caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) {{is added to the}} sand, and the {{resulting}} slurry is piped to the extraction plant where it is agitated and the oil skimmed from the top.

The bitumen froth floats to the top of separation vessels, and is further treated to remove residual water and fine solids.|$|E
25|$|In 1628, {{during the}} {{political}} turmoil {{that culminated in}} his assassination, Buckingham commissioned another masque-like painting from Gerrit van Honthorst, The Liberal Arts presented to King Charles and Henrietta Maria.
