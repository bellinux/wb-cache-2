50|$|Gold and {{platinum}} {{are used}} for minority carrier lifetime control. They are used in some infrared detection applications. Gold introduces a <b>donor</b> <b>level</b> 0.35 eV above the valence band and an acceptor level 0.54 eV below the conduction band. Platinum introduces a <b>donor</b> <b>level</b> also at 0.35 eV above the valence band, but its acceptor level is only 0.26 eV below conduction band; as the acceptor level in n-type silicon is shallower, the space charge generation rate is lower and therefore the leakage current is also lower than for gold doping. At high injection levels platinum performs better for lifetime reduction. Reverse recovery of bipolar devices is more dependent on the low-level lifetime, and its reduction is better performed by gold. Gold provides a good tradeoff between forward voltage drop and reverse recovery time for fast switching bipolar devices, where charge stored in base and collector regions must be minimized. Conversely, in many power transistors a long minority carrier lifetime is required to achieve good gain, and the gold/platinum impurities must be kept low.|$|E

This process creates blue crystals with varying absorption coefficients depending on the concentrations of the dopant. A proposed mechanism explains that the conductivity of these crystals {{can be explained by}} a reaction of Cd atoms with interstitial F− ions. This creates more CdF2 molecules and releases electrons which are weakly bonded to trivalent dopant ions resulting in n-type conductivity and a hydrogenic <b>donor</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} {{photoluminescence}} from two electron satellites of donor-bound excitons {{as well as}} selective pair luminescence spectroscopy to study shallow <b>donor</b> <b>levels</b> in semi-insulating bulk GaAs. Bound exciton spectroscopy gives a donor binding energy equal to the effective mass value (5. 8 meV) for all samples investigated. Selective pair luminescence, in contrast, yields a sample-dependent value for the average donor binding energy, which varies between 5. 8 and approximately 7 meV. This discrepancy is attributed {{to the fact that}} bound exciton spectroscopy probes all <b>donor</b> <b>levels</b> whereas selective pair luminescence is sensitive to donors close to acceptors which are therefore more strongly disturbed.

The activation energy of <b>donor</b> <b>levels</b> as well as the existence of hysteresis loop has been investigated. The comparison of experimental results shows that by increasing the polymer percentage in the varistor structure as long as the nonlinear behavior is conserved, the threshold voltage increases. This comparison also indicates that increasing the polymer content in the varistor structure causes the temperature dependence of threshold voltage to decrease. It is also concluded that, by the increase of polymer content in the varistor structure, the activation energy of <b>donor</b> <b>levels</b> and the hysteresis value are increased...|$|R

5000|$|Charge {{carriers}} {{in these}} n-type oxides arise from three fundamental sources: interstitial metal ion impurities, oxygen vacancies, and doping ions. The first two sources always act as electron donors; indeed, some TCOs are fabricated solely using these two intrinsic sources as carrier generators. When an oxygen vacancy {{is present in}} the lattice it acts as a doubly charged electron donor. In ITO, for example, each oxygen vacancy causes the neighboring In3+ ion 5s orbitals to be stabilized from the 5s conduction band by the missing bonds to the oxygen ion, while two electrons are trapped at the site due to charge neutrality effects. This stabilization of the 5s orbitals causes a formation of a <b>donor</b> <b>level</b> for the oxygen ion, determined to be 0.03 eV below the conduction band. Thus these defects act as shallow donors to the bulk crystal. Common notation for this doping is Kröger-Vink notation and is written as: ...|$|E
5000|$|Another {{hypothesis}} is that the conductivity comes from free electrons left by oxygen vacancies in the SrTiO3. [...] SrTiO3 {{is known to be}} easily doped by oxygen vacancies, so this was initially considered a promising hypothesis. However, electron energy loss spectroscopy measurements have bounded the density of oxygen vacancies well below the density necessary to supply the measured free electron densities.Another proposed possibility is that oxygen vacancies in the surface of the LaAlO3 are remotely doping the SrTiO3. Under generic growth conditions, multiple mechanisms can coexist. A systematic study [...] across a wide growth parameter space demonstrated different roles played by oxygen vacancy formation and the polar gating at different interfaces. An obvious difference between oxygen vacancies and polar gating in creating the interface conductivity is that the carriers from oxygen vacancies are thermally activated as the <b>donor</b> <b>level</b> of oxygen vacancies is usually separated from the SrTiO3 conduction band, consequently exhibiting the carrier freeze-out effect at low temperatures; in contrast, the carriers originating from the polar gating are transferred into the SrTiO3 conduction band (Ti 3d orbitals) and are therefore degenerate.|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} analysis of the radiative recombination processes in Ag(InGa) Se 2 thin films grown by a three-stage method was carried out by photoluminescence. The temperature and excitation dependence of the photoluminescence spectra was used to identify the recombination types and determine the ionization energy of the defects in the films. Significant differences were observed between the spectra of the Ag-rich and Ag-poor samples. The Ag-rich films were dominated by two emission peaks of donor acceptor pairs (DAPs). The DAP at lower energy level is attributed to recombination of <b>donor</b> <b>level</b> 13. 8 meV (Agi) with acceptor level 70. 3 meV (AgIn), while the one at high energy level is assigned to recombination of <b>donor</b> <b>level</b> 18. 5 meV (Agi) with acceptor level 108. 9 (AgSe). When Ag/III atomic ratio was near 2. 00, a phonon related-structure began to appear, which is attributed to the phonon replica of the high energy level DAP. In the case of Ag-poor AIGS samples, the dominant broad asymmetric peaks of AIGS films with different Ag/III atomic ratios were related to potential fluctuation at low temperature, and the compensation level decreased with increasing Ag/III atomic ratio. The emission line was assigned to recombination of <b>donor</b> <b>level</b> 12. 7 meV (Agi) with acceptor level 175 meV (Ag Ga 2). When the excitation power and temperature were increased, new free-bound and DAP emission lines began to appear. The free-bound was assigned to the transition from the conduction band to an acceptor level of 80 meV (AgIn).

40|$|The silicon divacancy {{is one of}} {{the main}} defects of concern in {{radiation}} damage studies of Charge-Coupled Devices (CCDs) and, being immobile at room temperature, the defect is accessible to a variety of characterisation techniques. As such, there is a large amount of (often conflicting) information in the literature regarding this defect. Here we study the <b>donor</b> <b>level</b> of the divacancy, one of three energy levels which lie between the silicon valence and conduction bands. The <b>donor</b> <b>level</b> of the divacancy acts as a trap for holes in silicon and therefore can be studied through the use of a p-channel CCD. The method of trap-pumping, linked closely to the process of pocket-pumping, has been demonstrated in the literature over the last two years to allow for in-situ analysis of defects in the silicon of CCDs. However, most work so far has been a demonstartion [sic] of the techinique [sic]. We begin here to use the technique for detailed studies of a specific defect centre in silicon, the <b>donor</b> <b>level</b> of the divacancy. The trap density post-irradiation can be found, and each instance of the trap identified independently of all others. Through the study of the trap response at different clocking frequencies one can measure directly the defect emission time constant, and through tracking this at different temperatures, it is possible to use Shockley-Read-Hall theory to calculate the trap energy level and cross-section. A large population of traps, all with parameters consistent with the <b>donor</b> <b>level</b> of the divacancy, has been studied, leading to a measure of the distribution of properties. The emission time constant, energy level and cross-section are found to have relatively large spreads, significantly beyond the small uncertainty in the measurement technique.
