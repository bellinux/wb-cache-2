40|$|Interests in an {{overlay coating}} technology, so called {{hardfacing}} technology, have steadily increased {{to improve the}} service life of hot-working tools through {{the reduction of the}} wear of tool surfaces. Characteristics of the overlay coated layer are dependent on geometrical parameters and material properties of sub-layers. The aims of the paper is {{to examine the effects of}} geometrical parameters of the overlay coated layer on thermal stress-strain distributions of Co-based super-alloy deposited layer on <b>hot-working</b> <b>tool</b> steel using finite element analysis (FEA). The overlay coated layer is designed as two sub-layers including the wear resistance layer with Co-based super-alloy and the thermal stress control layer (TSCL). The material of the TSCL is composed of 50 % of Co-based super-alloy and 50 % of <b>hot-working</b> <b>tool</b> steel. The protruded height and the inclined angle are chosen as geometrical parameters. The influence of the protruded height and the inclined angle on thermal stress-strain distributions in the vicinity of the overlay coated layer and the strain deviation in joined regions is quantitatively investigated. From the results of the investigation, an appropriate design methodology of the overlay coated layer is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} the thermal and mechanical loadings applied to the tools during steel thixoforming process {{in order to determine}} appropriate tool materials and solutions. This evaluation was realized thanks to experimental trials and to the finite elements simulations. The effect of these loadings on the tool’s failure modes are highlighted and compared to the ones observed in classical forming processes. Beyond this, the failure modes of different tool materials and solutions are presented. The tested materials are <b>hot-working</b> <b>tool</b> steels. Other possibilities and tool coating or surface treatments are discussed as well. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe H 13 <b>hot-working</b> <b>tool</b> {{steel is}} widely used as die {{material}} in the warm forming of Ti– 6 Al– 4 V titanium alloy sheet. However, under the heating condition, severe friction and lubricating conditions between the H 13 tools and Ti– 6 Al– 4 V titanium alloy sheet would cause difficulty in guaranteeing forming quality. Surface modification {{may be used to}} control the level of friction force, reduce the friction wear and extend the service life of dies. In this paper, four surface modification methods (chromium plating, TiAlN coating, surface polishing and nitriding treatment) were applied to the H 13 surfaces. Taking the coefficient of friction (CoF) and the wear degree as evaluation indicators, the high-temperature tribological behavior of the surface modified H 13 steel was experimentally investigated under different tribological conditions. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the tribological properties of the TiAlN coating under dry friction condition are better than the others for a wide range of temperature (from room temperature to 500 °C), while there is little difference of tribological properties between different surface modifications under graphite lubricated condition, and the variation law of CoF with temperature under graphite lubricated is opposite to that under the dry friction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Hot-working</b> <b>tools</b> are {{frequently}} exposed to high cyclic temperature and mechanical loads, usually resulting in thermal fatigue cracking, which is observed as {{a network of}} fine cracks on the surface. The crack network degrades {{the performance of the}} tool and even invalidates it. Deep rolling is a surface strengthening treatment generally applied to improve the fatigue performance of metal components. But few attentions are paid on its influence on thermal fatigue cracking of the components, considering the relaxation of residual stresses and work hardening, which are deemed to mainly account for the improvement of fatigue performance. In this paper experiments were carried out to investigate the influence of deep rolling on thermal fatigue behavior of hot-work tool steel AISI H 13. The experiment results show that deep rolling can improve the thermal fatigue behavior of AISI H 13. To explore the mechanism of the effect, the changes of the residual stresses, the microhardness of the samples are also presented...|$|R
