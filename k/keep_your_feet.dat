6000|$|... "Let {{your hands}} and arms lie flat on the water! Don't try to raise your head farther than I let you! <b>Keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> still! Let {{yourself}} hang helpless while I hold you and look round for the raft." ...|$|E

And remember, you guys are public enemy no. 1. You are his biggest enemy. Journalists, ISIS, normal-length ties. And somehow, you're the bad guys. That's why you gotta <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>foot</b> on the gas." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{you turn}} on the ninth step, <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> front <b>foot</b> on the line and turn taking several small steps with the other foot (demonstrate) and take 9 heel-to-toe steps back down the line.|$|R

6000|$|... "Good water, hey?" [...] dissented Anderson, after {{drinking}} a second cup. [...] "Boy that's wet, but it ain't water to drink. Come {{down in the}} foot-hills an' I'll show you. My ranch 's called 'Many Waters,' an' you can't <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> dry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Huh!" [...] said Del Mar {{a little}} later to Michael, having strolled down the {{platform}} to where the crate was piled on a truck with other baggage destined for the train. [...] "Got your foot smashed. Well, it'll teach you a lesson to <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> inside." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} it will be {{possible}} to <b>keep</b> on <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> for such a long distance?" [...] I asked anxiously, because until this moment I supposed my father was getting on as comfortably as a man in his condition could reasonably expect.|$|R
5000|$|... "That {{final run}} {{was more like}} how I knew it could be done. Just a {{question}} of digging a bit deeper a taking a few more risks. It got a bit sideways here and there, and I used too much kerb at the exit of the last corner, but there's {{no way you can}} lift even for a fraction of a second. You just have to <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>foot</b> in it and hope that you don't get the car completely on the grass.After my fastest lap, I could see that I was P1 on the huge television screen alongside the circuit, and thought that was good news. As I drove round, there were fans waving flags all round the circuit and I appreciated that." [...] Damon Hill, commenting on taking provisional pole positionon Friday.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the band}} decided to record, it seemed natural to include Ibold. The process {{involved}} rehearsing the songs {{during the week}} {{in the basement of}} Moore and Gordon's house and subsequently recording them over the weekend. Shelley recalled, [...] "It was like having a different project every week and it felt like we were doing a single every weekend. You kind of have to <b>keep</b> on <b>your</b> <b>feet,</b> the speed aspect to this album was very enjoyable". Eventually the band signed with Matador in 2008.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Jeff," [...] she wrote, [...] "in {{regard to}} your strictures on war I have [...] only {{to say that}} I agree with you, as I have always done on all [...] points, heart and soul.

"Kin you <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> {{through the}} West River Bridge, with the narrer-gage comin' {{in on one}} side, an' the Montreal flyer the other, an' the old bridge teeterin' between?"

[...] "Kin you put your nose down on the {{cow-catcher}} of a locomotive when you're waitin' at the depot an' let 'em play 'Curfew shall not ring to-night' with the big brass bell?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. De Kock! I will {{thank you}} to behave yourself!" [...] here {{interrupted}} an old lady, who sat next to the speaker. [...] "Please <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> to yourself! You have spoiled my brocade! Is it necessary, pray, to illustrate a remark in so practical a style? Our friend here can surely comprehend you without all this. Upon my word, you are nearly as great a donkey as the poor unfortunate imagined himself. Your acting is very natural, as I live." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{devil is}} in me for an auld fule!" [...] said Sir Mungo; [...] "but I must needs concern mysell--I that owe so little either to fortune or my fellow-creatures, must, I say, needs concern mysell--with this springald, whom I will warrant {{to be as}} obstinate as a pig possessed with a devil, for it's the cast of his family; and yet I maun e'en fling away some sound advice on him.--My dainty young Lord Glenvarloch, {{understand}} me distinctly, for this is no bairn's-play. When the Prince said sae much to me as I have repeated to you, it was equivalent to a command not to appear in his presence; wherefore take an auld man's advice that wishes you weel, and maybe a wee thing better than he has reason to wish ony body. Jouk, and let the jaw gae by, like a canny bairn--gang hame to <b>your</b> lodgings, <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>foot</b> frae taverns, and your fingers frae the dice-box; compound your affairs quietly wi' some ane that has better favour than yours about Court, and {{you will get a}} round spell of money to carry you to Germany, or elsewhere, to push your fortune. It was a fortunate soldier that made your family four or five hundred years syne, and, if you are brave and fortunate, you may find the way to repair it. But, take my word for it, that in this Court you will never thrive." ...|$|R
5000|$|His {{apparent}} disrespect {{was extended}} to his own position: [...] You people are just like drunkards. I don’t know how you manage to <b>keep</b> on <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> in such a sodden condition. Why everyone will die laughing at you. It all seems so easy, so {{why do we have}} to live to see a day like this? Can’t you understand that in the whole Empire of the T’ang there are no ‘teachers of Zen’?”A monk stepped forth and asked, “How can you say that? At this very moment, as all can see, we are sitting face to face with one who has appeared in the world to be a teacher of monks and a leader of men!”Please note that I did not say there is no Zen. I merely pointed out that there are no teachers! ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You will do, lad," [...] Captain Ewart said to him, {{after giving}} {{him his first}} lesson. [...] "Your fencing has done much for you, and has given you an easy poise of body and head. Always {{remember}} that it is upon balancing the body that you should depend for your seat; although, of course, {{the grip of the}} knees does a good deal. Also remember, always, to <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> straight; nothing is so awkward as turned-out toes. Besides, in that position, if the horse starts you are very likely to dig your spurs into him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hard a-lee!" [...] {{cried the}} captain. [...] "Haul in your slack as she comes," [...] {{he called to}} Huish. [...] "Haul in your slack, put your back into it; <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> out of the coils." [...] A sudden blow sent Huish flat along the deck, and the captain was in his place. [...] "Pick {{yourself}} up and keep the wheel hard over!" [...] he roared. [...] "You wooden fool, {{you wanted to get}} killed, I guess. Draw the jib," [...] he cried a moment later; and then to Huish, [...] "Give me the wheel again, {{and see if you can}} coil that sheet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dress you up?" [...] says Atterbury; [...] "I {{should say}} not! Just {{as you are}} you're worth more to the {{business}} than a whole roomful {{of the things they}} pin chrysanthemums on. You're to play the part of the solid but disheveled capitalist from the Far West. You despise the conventions. You've got so many stocks you can afford to shake socks. Conservative, homely, rough, shrewd, saving--that's your pose. It's a winner in New York. <b>Keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> on the desk and eat apples. Whenever anybody comes in eat an apple.

6000|$|Probably {{he was not}} {{personally}} a Upas tree, probably the rancor toward him left from being bawled after {{by one of his}} gatemen at a turning we had taken in his enclosure, [...] "That's a private path!" [...] was unjust. There was no sign, such as everywhere in England renders a place secure from intrusion. The word [...] "Private" [...] painted up anywhere does the effect of bolts and bars and of all obsolete man-traps beyond it, and is not for a moment that challenge to the wayfaring foot which it seems so often with us; but the warnings to the public which we make so mandatory, the English language with unfailing gentleness. You are not told to <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>foot</b> or <b>your</b> wheel to a certain pathway; you are [...] "requested," [...] and sometimes even [...] "kindly requested"; I do not know but once I was [...] "respectfully requested." [...] Perhaps that nobleman's possession of these lands was so new that his retainers had to practise something of unwonted rudeness in keeping it wholly his where he chose. At any rate, the rule of civility is so universal that the politeness from class to class is, for what the stranger sees, all but unfailing. I dare say he does not see everything, even the Argus-eyed American, but apparently the manners of the lower class, where they have been touched by the upper, have been softened and polished to the same consistence and complexion. When it comes to the proffers, and refusals, and insistences, and acceptances between people of condition, such as I witnessed once in a crowded first-class carriage from London on an Oxford holiday, nothing could be more gently urgent, more beautifully forbearing. If the writers of our romantic novels could get just those manners into their fiction, I should not mind their dealing so much with the English nobility and gentry; for those who intend being our nobility and gentry, by-and-by, could not do better than study such high-breeding.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, what pitiful words!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "If {{there is}} one thing sadder in life than the slavery of the people, it is to find a woman who has {{forgotten}} her sex. Almost you inspire me, young lady, with the desire to take you by the hand and offer you my escort into the gentler ways. If I were sure of success, not even my fair friends {{on the other side of}} the Channel could <b>keep</b> me from <b>your</b> <b>feet.</b> Maraton, look away from the walls. There's nothing beyond--just a world full of fancies. There's some Sole Otèro on your plate which is worth tasting, and there's champagne in your glass. What matter if there are troubles outside?

60|$|Once, when I {{looked down}} from a bare hilltop into a valley where the trail ran, I had a most {{interesting}} glimpse of the big buck {{doing the same thing}} from a hill farther on too far away for a shot, but near enough to see plainly through my field glass. The deer were farther ahead than I supposed. They had made a run for it, intending to rest after first putting a good space between them and anything that might follow. Now they were undoubtedly lying down in some far-away thicket, their minds at rest, but their four feet doubled under them for a jump at short notice. Trust your nose, but <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> under you--that is deer wisdom on going to sleep. Meanwhile, to take no chances, the wary old leader had circled back, to wind the trail and watch it awhile from a distance before joining them in their rest.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} praying for you, Fred; and now I {{tell you to}} look to your Father which is in Heaven for guidance, and {{not to take it}} from any poor frail sinful human being. Ask Him to <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> steady in the path, and your heart pure, and your {{thoughts}} free from wickedness. Oh, Fred, keep your mind and body clear before Him, and if you will kneel to Him for protection, He will show you a way through all difficulties." [...] It was thus that she intended to tell him that his promise to her, made on the previous day, was to count for nought, and that he was to marry the girl if by no other way he could release himself from vice. But she could not bring herself to declare to him in plain terms that he had better marry Kate O'Hara, and bring his new Countess to Scroope in order that she might be fitly received by her predecessor. It might be that the Lord would still show him {{a way out of the}} two evils.|$|E
6000|$|... "But a cause can't be a {{good one}} unless some good comes of it! If there was a chance at all, I would say go at 'em, daddy, an' bowl 'em down like skittles, but you know there's no chance in your plan. Boltin' into the woods an' gittin' lost would be little use in the face o' savages that can track a deer by {{invisible}} footprints. An' fighting them would be like fighting moskitoes--one thousand down, another thousand come on! Besides, when you an' I are killed--which we're sure to be--what would come o' mother, sittin' there all alone, day after day, wonderin' why we never come back, though we promised to do so? Think how anxious it'll make her for years to come, an' how broken-hearted at last; an' think how careful she always was of you. Don't you remember in that blessed letter she sent me, just before we sailed, how she tells me to look well after you, an' sew the frogs on your sea-coat when they git loose, for she knows you'll never do it yourself, but will be fixin' it up with a wooden skewer or a bit o' rope-yarn. An' how I was to see an' make you <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> dry by changin' your hose for you when you were asleep, for you'd never change them yourself till all your toes an' heels came through 'em.

[...] "Then {{presently}} one said, quite fiercely, 'Get back into balk there, get back fifteen inches,' and the other voice said, 'By God! I'll shoot from here.' Then there was a dead stillness, and then a voice almost screamed, 'You've potted me. You've potted me. That ends it.' And then I heard the other say in a low tone, 'Forgive me, I didn't mean it. I never meant it to end that way.' ...|$|R
50|$|In 1973 Lazenby {{said of the}} film, {{then called}} The Golden Needles of Ecstasy:I have worked out every day for two hours and have run three miles every morning to get fit for the role. It is the most taxing form of film {{fighting}} activity in the world. You can't be slow and hope {{to look as if}} you're standing up to these experts. But you learn from the fight masters employed on the film, learn a bit of karate and a bit of ballet and hope to <b>keep</b> on <b>your</b> <b>feet.</b> What I mostly want to do is earn us enough money to live the way we want to. Nothing on earth could buy me into the degradation of another Bond film, with all that entails.To try to keep the success of Lee's films going, Chow added in Hong Kong stars Angela Mao, Betty Ting, and Sammo Hung and also well-known Australian wrestler Roger Ward to the film's cast along with Lazenby. In addition to this he also enlisted rival studio Shaw Brothers run by Run Run Shaw as another producer {{to help pay for the}} film's huge production cost based on Hong Kong film industry standards. Chow also kept producer Andre Morgan on board as he had helped with Lee's films and this would help to bring video revenue years later.|$|R
6000|$|Just {{about this}} time I {{received}} a letter from my dear mother, who was aware of my plans. It cost me some anxiety, as it was utterly impossible that I should comply with the injunctions it contained. [...] "Jeffry, my dear boy," [...] she wrote, [...] "let me entreat you, with all the solemnity of maternal solicitude, {{to take care of your}} health. Let Russians and Turks kill and expose themselves as they please, but ever bear in remembrance that it is your duty to avoid danger. Whatever you do, <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>feet</b> dry and your--I need not go further into particulars; medical allusions cannot always be couched in language such as one desires. Never sleep on damp ground, nor, if possible, without a roof or a covering of some sort over your head. Even a parasol is better than nothing. If, despite your precautions, you should catch cold, tie a worsted sock--one of the red and black striped ones I have knitted for you--round your neck, and take one drop of aconite--only one, remember-- before going to bed. I know how, with your allopathic notions, you will smile at this advice, but I assure you, as your mother, that it will prove an infallible cure. Never sit in a draught when you can avoid it. If you ever come under fire, which I trust you never may, be sure to get behind a house, or a wall, or a stone, if possible; if you cannot do so, get behind a soldier, one larger than yourself would be preferable of course, but if you have not the opportunity of doing this, then turn your side to the enemy, because in that position you are a much narrower target, and more likely to escape their bullets. I need not caution you not to run away. I would rather see you, dear boy, in a premature grave, than hear that you had run away. But you could not run away. No Childers ever did so--except from school.|$|E
