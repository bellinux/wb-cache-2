5|$|Like the {{components}} of other intermediate filaments, the lamin monomer contains an alpha-helical domain used by two monomers to coil around each other, forming a <b>dimer</b> structure called a coiled coil. Two of these <b>dimer</b> structures then join side by side, in an antiparallel arrangement, to form a tetramer called a protofilament. Eight of these protofilaments form a lateral arrangement that is twisted to form a ropelike filament. These filaments can be assembled or disassembled in a dynamic manner, meaning that changes in {{the length of the}} filament depend on the competing rates of filament addition and removal.|$|E
5|$|Physiological serpin {{polymers}} {{are thought}} to form via domain swapping events, where a segment of one serpin protein inserts into another. Domain-swaps occur when mutations or environmental factors interfere with {{the final stages of}} serpin folding to the native state, causing high-energy intermediates to misfold. Both <b>dimer</b> and trimer domain-swap structures have been solved. In the <b>dimer</b> (of antithrombin), the RCL and part of the A-sheet incorporates into the A-sheet of another serpin molecule. The domain-swapped trimer (of antitrypsin) forms via the exchange of an entirely different region of the structure, the B-sheet (with each molecule's RCL inserted into its own A-sheet). It has also been proposed that serpins may form domain-swaps by inserting the RCL of one protein into the A-sheet of another (A-sheet polymerisation). These domain-swapped <b>dimer</b> and trimer structures are though to be the building blocks of the disease-causing polymer aggregates, but the exact mechanism is still unclear.|$|E

If a rhodocenium containing melt is treated with sodium or potassium metals and then sublimed onto a liquid nitrogen-cooled cold finger, a black polycrystalline material results. Warming this material to room temperature produces a yellow solid which has been confirmed as the rhodocene <b>dimer.</b> A similar method {{can be used to}} prepare the iridocene <b>dimer.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} and fate of thymine-containing pyrimidine <b>dimers</b> in Paramecium aurelia DNA {{was investigated in}} three experimental series: production of <b>dimers</b> by UV irradiation, fate of <b>dimers</b> in the dark, and “loss of photoreactivability of <b>dimers.</b> ” It is shown that cyclobutyl <b>dimers</b> are made by UV irradiation of Paramecium DNA in vivo, that because of cytoplasmic absorption the number of <b>dimers</b> made in DNA irradiated in vivo is much lower than in DNA irradiated in vitro, that <b>dimers</b> are lost from animals incubated in the dark after irradiation, and that all the <b>dimers</b> that remain in the animals can be destroyed by photoreactivating illumination. Since mutation induction is photoreactivable, these and previous photoreactivation data suggest that pyrimidine <b>dimers</b> are important in mutation induction in P. aurelia...|$|R
50|$|Pyrimidine <b>dimers</b> are {{molecular}} lesions {{formed from}} thymine or cytosine bases in DNA via photochemical reactions. Ultraviolet light induces {{the formation of}} covalent linkages by reactions localized on the C=C double bonds. In dsRNA (double-stranded RNA), uracil <b>dimers</b> may also accumulate {{as a result of}} UV radiation. Two common UV products are cyclobutane pyrimidine <b>dimers</b> (CPDs, including thymine <b>dimers)</b> and 6,4 photoproducts. These premutagenic lesions alter the structure of DNA and consequently inhibit polymerases and arrest replication. <b>Dimers</b> may be repaired by photoreactivation or nucleotide excision repair, but unrepaired <b>dimers</b> are mutagenic. Pyrimidine <b>dimers</b> are the primary cause of melanomas in humans.|$|R

5|$|Additional {{evidence}} of the oxygen atmosphere comes from spectral detection of gases trapped in the ice at the surface of Ganymede. The detection of ozone (O3) bands was announced in 1996. In 1997 spectroscopic analysis revealed the <b>dimer</b> (or diatomic) absorption features of molecular oxygen. Such an absorption can arise only if the oxygen is in a dense phase. The best candidate is molecular oxygen trapped in ice. The depth of the <b>dimer</b> absorption bands depends on latitude and longitude, rather than on surface albedo—they tend to decrease with increasing latitude on Ganymede, whereas O3 shows an opposite trend. Laboratory work has found that O2 would not cluster or bubble but dissolve in ice at Ganymede's relatively warm surface temperature of 100 K (−173.15°C).|$|E
5|$|Diaminocarbenes do {{not truly}} dimerise, but rather form the <b>dimer</b> by {{reaction}} via formamidinium salts, a protonated precursor species. Accordingly, this reaction can be acid catalysed. This reaction occurs because unlike imidazolium based carbenes, {{there is no}} loss of aromaticity in protonation of the carbene.|$|E
5|$|If this <b>dimer</b> existed as a dicarbene, the {{electron}} lone pairs on the carbenic carbon {{would be forced}} into close proximity.

These materials will affect the properties of biodiesel fuels. Since used vegetable oils are mainly used as raw materials of biodiesel fuels in Japan, it is important know {{the effects of the}} <b>dimers</b> on the fuel properties quantitatively. In this study, the relationship between the concentration of <b>dimers</b> of methylesters and the kinetic viscosity of biodiesel fuels are studied...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{behavior}} of surface <b>dimers</b> on Ge(001) {{has been studied}} by positioning {{the tip of a}} scanning tunneling microscope over single flip-flopping <b>dimers</b> and measuring the tunneling current as a function of time. We observe that not just symmetric, but also asymmetric appearing <b>dimers</b> exhibit flip-flop motion. The dynamics of flip-flopping <b>dimers</b> can be used to sensitively gauge the local potential landscape of the surface. Through a spatial and time-resolved measurement of the flip-flop frequency of the <b>dimers,</b> local strain fields near surface defects can be accurately probed...|$|R
30|$|Thus, {{solid-state}} {{synthesis of}} AuNP <b>dimers</b> cross-linked with NDT molecules occurred directly on a glass surface coated by amine terminated molecules. These <b>dimers</b> have interparticle spacing {{determined by the}} length of NDT molecule. The orientation of the <b>dimers</b> on a glass surface is different. Major numbers of <b>dimers</b> are parallel {{to the surface of}} glass plane, while others have tilted orientation. This morphology of chemically attached <b>dimers</b> led to broadening of UV-visible absorption spectra and appearing of features in spectra of polarization difference ρ(λ) under different angles of incident light. The growing number of AuNP <b>dimers</b> leads to broadening of LSPR band due to dominating influence of interparticle plasmon coupling that caused by decreasing of interparticle distance.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} fully explore the biofunctional {{potential}} of proanthocyanidins (PA), isolated and well-characterised PA <b>dimers</b> are of great importance. Current methods to obtain pure A- and B-type <b>dimers</b> are laborious, because they comprise multiple chromatographic steps, often yielding {{only one or}} two specific <b>dimers.</b> In the current study, an efficient isolation procedure is described, to isolate a large variety of A-type <b>dimers</b> from peanut skins and B-type <b>dimers</b> from grape seeds. Yields increased 20 - 400 times for A-type <b>dimers</b> and about 10 times for B-type <b>dimers</b> compared to other methods with a lesser number of chromatographic steps. <b>Dimers</b> isolated from peanut skins were identified as; epicatechin-(2 -O- 7, 4 - 8) -catechin (A 1), epicatechin-(2 -O- 7, 4 - 8) -epicatechin (A 2), epicatechin-(2 -O- 7, 4 - 6) -catechin, epicatechin-(2 -O- 7, 4 - 8) -entcatechin, isolated from peanut skins for the first time, and epicatechin-(4 - 6) -catechin (B 7). <b>Dimers</b> from grape seeds were identified as; epicatechin-(4 - 8) -catechin (B 1), epicatechin-(4 - 8) -epicatechin (B 2), catechin-(4 - 8) -catechin (B 3) and catechin-(4 - 8) -epicatechin (B 4...|$|R

Cells transfected with human leukocyte antigen (HLA) –DR A and B genes were labeled at saturation with a univalent probe consisting of Fab coupled to R-phycoerythrin. Analysis of the intensities of fluorescent spots on the cell surface revealed the presence of single and double particles consistent with the simultaneous presence of HLA-DR heterodimers and <b>dimers</b> of <b>dimers.</b> The proportion of double particles was lower at 37 �C than at 22 �C, suggesting that the heterodimers and <b>dimers</b> of <b>dimers</b> exist in a temperature-dependent equilibrium.

5|$|In aprotic solvents, oligomers, {{such as the}} {{well-known}} acetic acid <b>dimer,</b> may be formed by hydrogen bonding. An acid may also form hydrogen bonds to its conjugate base. This process, known as homoconjugation, {{has the effect of}} enhancing the acidity of acids, lowering their effective pKa values, by stabilizing the conjugate base. Homoconjugation enhances the proton-donating power of toluenesulfonic acid in acetonitrile solution by a factor of nearly 800. In aqueous solutions, homoconjugation does not occur, because water forms stronger hydrogen bonds to the conjugate base than does the acid.|$|E
5|$|More {{than half}} of all known cancers involve {{mutations}} of p53, a tumor suppressor protein present in every cell which regulates the cell cycle and signals for cell death in the event of damage to DNA. Specific mutations in p53 can disrupt these functions, allowing an abnormal cell to continue growing unchecked, resulting in the development of tumors. Analysis of these mutations helps explain the root causes of p53-related cancers. In 2004, Folding@home was used to perform the first molecular dynamics study of the refolding of p53's protein <b>dimer</b> in an all-atom simulation of water. The simulation's results agreed with experimental observations and gave insights into the refolding of the <b>dimer</b> that were formerly unobtainable. This was the first peer reviewed publication on cancer from a distributed computing project. The following year, Folding@home powered a new method to identify the amino acids crucial for the stability of a given protein, which was then used to study mutations of p53. The method was reasonably successful in identifying cancer-promoting mutations and determined the effects of specific mutations which could not otherwise be measured experimentally.|$|E
5|$|Samarium forms a cyclopentadienide Sm(C5H5)3 and its chloroderivatives Sm(C5H5)2Cl and Sm(C5H5)Cl2. They are {{prepared}} by reacting samarium trichloride with NaC5H5 in tetrahydrofuran. Contrary to cyclopentadienides {{of most other}} lanthanides, in Sm(C5H5)3 some C5H5 rings bridge each other by forming ring vertexes η1 or edges η2 toward another neighboring samarium atom, thereby creating polymeric chains. The chloroderivative Sm(C5H5)2Cl has a <b>dimer</b> structure, which is more accurately expressed as (η5-C5H5)2Sm(µ-Cl)2(η5-C5H5)2.

When the embryos were exposed to various doses of UVR from a FS- 40 sunlamp followed by exposure to photoreactivating light (PRL) (320 - 400 nm), the number of pyrimidine <b>dimers</b> decreased significantly.

5|$|The {{most common}} {{cellular}} signals activating the SOS response are regions of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), arising from stalled replication forks or double-strand breaks, which are processed by DNA helicase {{to separate the}} two DNA strands. In the initiation step, RecA protein binds to ssDNA in an ATP hydrolysis driven reaction creating RecA–ssDNA filaments. RecA–ssDNA filaments activate LexA autoprotease activity, which ultimately leads to cleavage of LexA <b>dimer</b> and subsequent LexA degradation. The loss of LexA repressor induces transcription of the SOS genes and allows for further signal induction, inhibition of cell division {{and an increase in}} levels of proteins responsible for damage processing.|$|E
