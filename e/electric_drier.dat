40|$|Abstract: The present work {{consists}} {{is aimed}} at studying the influence of pre-treatment on the drying on the drying kinetic of a local Okro variety. Experiments were performed in an forced convection <b>electric</b> <b>drier</b> at an air speed of 2 m s− 1 within the temperature range 40 - 55 °C. The Okro sample were blanched before drying. During experimentation, {{the mass of the}} Okro sample, the ambient air temperature and relative humilities were continuously recorded. From the experimental results recorded, the curves of loss of weight with drying time were drawn. Several models were tested to model the drying kinetics. The Midilli & al. model had the highest R 2 value (99. 72 %), the lowest MSE and a very reduced χ 2 value. This model described best, the drying behaviour of Okro. The effective diffusivity varied from 4, 462 10 − 9 to 2, 941 10 − 9 m 2 s− 1 for the non-blanched Okro samples and from 4, 662 10 − 9 and 3, 452 10 − 9 m 2 s− 1 for blanched samples. The activation energy was found to be 779 Kj mol− 1. Key words: Okro • drying • blanching • effective diffusivity • activation energ...|$|E

The present study was carried out to determine the effect of drying conditions on the chemical composition as well as the physical and functional properties and antioxidant activity of flours of this tuber. Slices of the yellow and mixed sections of the tubers were processed into flours by sun-drying (temperature a parts per thousand 35 A degrees C) and hot air <b>electric</b> <b>drying</b> at varying temperatures (50 A degrees C, 60 A degrees C, and 70 A degrees C) before milling. Drying temperature and technique showed marginal effect on the protein, fat, fiber, ash, and carbohydrate content of taro flours. Color attributes, physical and functional properties, 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picryl-hydrazyl radical antioxidant activity, as well as reducing power of flours were found to vary significantly (P < 0. 05) due to either the drying temperature or method. Hot air <b>electric</b> <b>drying</b> at lower temperatures (< 70 A degrees C) produced flour with higher water absorption capacity (WAC), water solubility index (WSI), porosity, bulk density, and preserved antioxidant activity of flour, whereas sun-drying was associated with flours of higher WSI but lower WAC, and lower antioxidant capacity. It was noticed that carotenoids and ascorbic acid contributed to the antioxidant activity in taro flours, and taro flours made of different taro portions showed different antioxidant mechanisms. This study highlights the low temperature hot air-drying method as a very good lead for preparation of effective natural functional flours for culinary system...|$|R

The effect of contact time, pH, initial concentration of trichloroethylene and temperature on its adsorption were investigated. Adsorption isotherms and related constants were also determined. Results showed that contact times to reach equilibrium changed from 30 min (for 150 μg/L initial concentration) to 10 min (for 600 μg/L concentrations) at 25 °C; the equilibrium times in 40 °C were 40 min and 15 min, respectively. Multi-wall carbon nanotubes showed to act as a good adsorbent for TCE in a wide range of pH=(3 - 9). For pH> 9, adsorption decreased due to ionization of oxygen-containing groups.

30|$|The {{object of}} this study was to {{understand}} precisely the drying characteristics of wetwood of todomatsu (Abies sachalinensis Mast.). For this purpose, the vibrational properties of wetwood of todomatsu at high temperature were compared with those of normal parts that had lower green moisture content than the wetwood. Specimens were cut respectively from the wetwood and normal parts, and matched in the radial direction. The specimens and the measuring systems were placed in an <b>electric</b> <b>drying</b> oven and free-free vibration tests were conducted in the oven under absolutely dry conditions. The wetwood and the normal parts were tested separately. The temperature was raised from room temperature to 200 °C and then lowered to 50 °C in steps of 25 °C. The specific Young’s modulus decreased with an increase in temperature during the heating process while it increased with the decreasing temperature during the cooling process. There was no significant difference in the specific Young’s modulus between the wetwood and the normal part at all tested temperatures. The loss tangent took a minimum value at about 100 °C in both the heating and cooling processes. There was no significant difference in the loss tangent between the wetwood and the normal part. Thus, the elastic and viscoelastic behaviors of the wetwood appear to be similar to those of the normal part in the temperature range of an actual kiln-drying process.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{electrical}} resistivity {{is an important}} parameter describing materials’ ability to conduct <b>electric</b> current. <b>Dry</b> cementitious materials exhibit very high value of the {{electrical resistivity}} due to their insulating nature. Indeed, the electrical resistivity of an oven-dried concrete is about 109 Ω m. However, it can be significantly decreased by a sufficient amount of electrically conductive admixture. Such an enhancement is beneficial in self-sensing or self-heating concrete design, {{but it is not}} convenient in special cases such as design of concrete used for railroad ties production. In this case, mechanical properties (tensile strength) need to be improved without an accompanying decrease of the electrical resistivity. In this paper, reference concrete together with three types of steel-fibre reinforced concrete (0. 5 % vol., 1 % vol., 2 % vol.) were prepared and analyzed in terms of determination of electric properties. Experiments were carried out in both, DC and AC electric regime by means of precise DC multimeter and LCR meter measurements...|$|R

40|$|Drying of solids {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} and most common unit {{operations}} found in diverse processes. In this paper the drying of hygroscopic textile materials is discussed. The authors have previously investigated the drying kinetic of different fabrics dried by a hot air jet. In this paper a comparison between the convective and <b>electric</b> IR <b>drying</b> is made. In particular two fabrics with fibers which show a different hygroscopic behaviour are analysed: wool and cellulose/cotton. Unlike the convective drying, IR drying is weakly affected by the radiation properties and by the hygroscopic behaviour of the two fabrics. This is likely due to a better diffusion of the heat flux, which is constant over the entire drying surface in the case of IR heating, and produces unexpected results on the nondimensional kinetic parameter (characteristic curve). Wool shows a complete different characteristic curve if dried with IR or with convective flow. The better performances have been reached with MW emitter, but it has been observed that this advantage decreases with the distance of the source from the surface to be dried...|$|R
