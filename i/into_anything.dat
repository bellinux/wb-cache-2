25|$|Grimm was {{not made}} to be a politician, and also soon {{realized}} that the National Assembly was not getting anywhere (it was eventually dissolved without establishing a constitution), and so asked {{to be released from}} his duties and returned with relief to his former studies.

He believed that good would triumph in the Parliament, and pushed for human rights legislation just as he wished for a unified Germany.|$|E

25|$|When he {{returned}} to England, Greig caused more controversy in the lead-up to the 1976 series against the West Indies. Appearing on television to discuss the coming summer, Greig's oratory created controversy when he expounded on West Indies players:I {{like to think that}} people are building these West Indians up, because I'm not really sure they're as good as everyone thinks they are. I think people tend to forget it wasn't that long ago they were beaten 5–1 by the Australians and only just managed to keep their heads above water against the Indians {{just a short time ago}} as well. Sure, they've got a couple of fast bowlers, but really I don't think we're going to run <b>into</b> <b>anything</b> more sensational than Thomson and Lillee and so really I'm not all that worried about them. You must remember that the West Indians, these guys, if they get on top are magnificent cricketers. But if they're down, they grovel, and I intend, with the help of Closey and a few others, to make them grovel.|$|E
500|$|Wilson McBee of Slant Magazine {{was more}} {{negative}} towards the album, writing that [...] "Let the Blind Lead presents an intriguing mixture of sounds, but rarely does Cox whip them <b>into</b> <b>anything</b> very exciting."

[...] Under the Radar magazine wrote {{that many of}} the tracks of Let the Blind Lead [...] "never materialize <b>into</b> <b>anything</b> more substantial than vapor." [...] Sean O'Neal of The Onion's The A.V. Club said that, considering the number of free songs Cox has released on his blog, a full-length album [...] "seems almost beside the point." [...] He wrote that the record's songs suggest the work of [...] "a bedroom-pop auteur who doesn't know when to quit tweaking". [...] Allmusic writer Marisa Brown found that, with Let the Blind Lead, [...] "as with Deerhunter, Cox has the tendency to try too hard to be profound (take the title -- or the title track -- for example), wanting so badly to say something important that he sounds trite and forced, and untrustworthy." [...] Jonathen Cohen wrote in his review for Magnet that [...] "Cox’s narratives make little sense", noting [...] "much of the time, he’s not even singing so much as wailing wordlessly".|$|E

500|$|However, Toby E. Huff {{writes that}} Shen Kuo's [...] "scattered set" [...] of {{writings}} lacks clear-cut organization and [...] "theoretical acuteness," [...] that is, scientific theory. Nathan Sivin wrote that Shen's originality stands [...] "cheek by jowl with trivial didacticism, court anecdotes, and ephemeral curiosities" [...] that provide little insight. Donald Holzman writes that Shen [...] "has nowhere organized his observations <b>into</b> <b>anything</b> like a general theory." [...] Huff writes {{that this was}} a systemic problem of early Chinese science, which lacked systematic treatment that could be found in European works such as the Concordance and Discordant Canons by the lawyer Gratian of Bologna (fl. 12th century). In regard to an overarching concept of science which could branch together all the various sciences studied by the Chinese, Sivin asserts that the writings of Shen Kuo [...] "do not indicate that he achieved, or even sought, an integrated framework for his diverse knowledge; the one common thread is the varied responsibilities of his career as a high civil servant." ...|$|E
500|$|After the Seven Network dropped Neighbours in 1985, rival channel Network Ten {{picked the}} series up. It {{initially}} attracted low ratings and Ten began {{working hard to}} publicise the series. They revamped the show and added several new cast members. Kylie Minogue had had a fairly successful career as a child actress, having appeared in various television dramas, including Skyways and The Henderson Kids, but she was considering giving up acting after failing to find further work. After finishing her school exams in 1985, Minogue then auditioned {{for the role of}} Charlene. She attended the audition dressed as the character and won the role. Of hiring Minogue, Neighbours casting director Jan Russ commented [...] "Kylie had done a couple of things before I saw her, but she was only 18 and as shy as a mouse. She really hadn't evolved <b>into</b> <b>anything</b> at that stage, but the camera loved her and I knew I had my Charlene."

500|$|... "A Good Man Goes to War" [...] has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews. IGN's Matt Risley rated the episode 9 out of 10, describing {{it as an}} [...] "epic" [...] mid-series finale which [...] "opened with a grandstanding, wonderfully [...] pre-credits tease and didn't really let up from there". He praised the spectacle and character development, but felt it led to {{a certain amount of}} [...] "the odd rushed scene...forgettable supporting , and little opportunity to develop the Headless Monks <b>into</b> <b>anything</b> particularly imposing". Dave Golder of SFX gave [...] "A Good Man Goes to War" [...] four and a half out of five stars, feeling it [...] "saved" [...] the sixth series and offered [...] "a satisfying slice of fantasy television which ticked lots of boxes: it featured dashing, daring storytelling which was bold and confident; it looked fantastic, there were some hilarious lines and the performance of the star upped his wattage a couple of notches once again". However, he was more critical of the Headless Monks and the direction of the battle at the end. Neela Debnath of The Independent was also favourable, praising the use of the cliffhanger and felt the complicated nature of the episode [...] "draws people more into the show and gets them thinking about it".|$|E
