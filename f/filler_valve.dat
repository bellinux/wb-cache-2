50|$|The NTSB {{launched}} {{an investigation into}} the crash. The final report, released in 2008, cited a fatigue crack in the air <b>filler</b> <b>valve</b> hole caused by inadequate maintenance.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present an {{intelligent}} hybrid controller for a paper machine system with ash content and dry weight as outputs and <b>filler</b> <b>valve</b> and thick stock valve as inputs. Simulation studies have been carried out to check the robust performance (10 % increase in each process gain, 10 % increase in each time delay, and 10 % decrease in each time constant) of the system. The improvement in the performance of proposed hybrid controller is compared with the Adaptive-neuro- fuzzy controller and Dahlin controller and evaluated in terms of ISE...|$|E
50|$|Gellman held patents for lighters, compacts, <b>filler</b> <b>valves,</b> and a {{container}} for personal items. Gellman's inventiveness extended {{to his office}} desk, which he designed with hidden elevators and pivoting drawers, giving him fingertip control over everything inside.|$|R
50|$|Many {{industries}} encounter {{problem with}} residues in the ball valve. Where the fluid is meant for human consumption, residues {{may also be}} health hazard, and when where the fluid changes {{from time to time}} contamination of one fluid with another may occur. Residues arise because in the half open position of the ball valve a gap is created between the ball bore and the body in which fluid can be trapped. To avoid the fluid getting into this cavity, the cavity has to be plugged, which can be done by extending the seats in such a manner that it is always in contact with the ball. This type of ball valve is known as Cavity <b>Filler</b> Ball <b>Valve.</b>|$|R
50|$|The rubber bulbs {{can also}} be {{replaced}} with wheel style pipette filler or flip style pipette filler. The flip style pipette <b>fillers</b> have two <b>valves</b> system and have a removable top valve which makes cleaning easy {{and it can be}} used with one hand. The plastic wheel style pump help reduce the amount of work done by the users, as there are no squeezing involved. The liquid is drawn up by use of wheel movement and can be easily released by using the lever. They are also easy to clean.|$|R
40|$|Pasteurized {{bottled milk}} {{supplied}} {{by a single}} dairy was frequently found to be contaminated with Yersinia spp. Investigations were carried out at the dairy {{in an effort to}} pinpoint the source of these organisms. Viable counts obtained from milk bottle rinses indicated that bottle washing was often unsatisfactory, and on one occasion Y. frederiksenii was isolated from the pooled rinse water of six bottles. Samples of milk were taken on arrival at the dairy and at various stages following pasteurization. Heat resistance tests carried out on strains of yersinia isolated from pasteurized milk indicated that they would not survive the pasteurization process. However two strains of yersinia were isolated from a sample of milk taken immediately after pasteurization but before bottling. The thermograph indicated that the time/temperature conditions applied during pasteurization were adequate. The presence of yersinia strains in the milk at this stage therefore suggests that undetectable levels of raw milk were being allowed to contaminate the pasteurized milk. The absence of yersinia in cartoned samples produced on the same day as contaminated bottled samples indicated that environmental contamination of the bottle <b>filler</b> <b>valve</b> also may have occurred at times. Results of this investigation indicate that increased vigilance is required to ensure proper operation of pasteurizers and bottle washers...|$|E

40|$|The {{calculation}} {{methods of the}} aerosuspension explosion pressure in the chamber provided with explosion-discharged opening depending on its area and damage pressure of the membrane mounted on it have been proposed. The following parameters have been determined: pressures of dispersed material aerosuspension explosion and rates of its growth in chamberts with volume 1 and 10 qu. m, participation degrees of metal and alloy powders in explosion of their aerosuspensions, combustion temperatures and flame distribution rates in large-scale aerodispersed systems. The explosion-protected <b>fillers</b> and explosion-preventing <b>valves</b> are introduced.
