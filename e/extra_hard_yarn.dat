50|$|A water {{frame is}} a water-powered {{spinning}} frame {{which was an}} easy way to create cotton thread. The first time the machine was used in 1768.

The design was partly based on a spinning machine built for Thomas Highs by clock maker John Kay, who was hired by Arkwright. Being run on water power, it produced stronger and <b>harder</b> <b>yarn</b> than the then famous 'Spinning Jenny', thus, greatly ushering the factory system.|$|R
