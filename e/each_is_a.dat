Ten of these monarchies are independent states, and equally share Queen Elizabeth II, who resides primarily in the United Kingdom, as their respective sovereign, making them part of a global grouping known as the Commonwealth realms, while the remaining three are dependencies of European monarchies. As such, none of the monarchies in the Americas have a permanently resident monarch.|$|E

500|$|Warhol sent Blum thirty-two [...] canvases of Campbell's Soup can portraits, each {{representing}} a particular {{variety of the}} Campbell's Soup flavors available at the time. The thirty-two canvases are very similar: <b>each</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> realistic depiction of the iconic, mostly red and white Campbell's Soup can silkscreened onto a white background. The canvases have minor variation in the lettering of the variety names. Most of the letterings are painted in red letters. Four varieties have black lettering: Clam Chowder has parenthetical black lettering below the variety name that said (Manhattan Style), {{which means that the}} soup is tomato- and broth-based instead of the cream-based New England style; Beef has parenthetical black lettering below the variety name that says (With Vegetables and Barley); Scotch Broth has parenthetical black lettering below the variety name that said (A Hearty Soup); and Minestrone had black parenthetical lettering saying (Italian-Style Vegetable Soup). There are two varieties with red lettered parenthetical labels: Beef Broth (Bouillon) and Consommé (Beef). The font sizes only vary slightly in the variety names. However, there are a few notable stylistic font differences. Old-fashioned Tomato Rice is the only variety with lower case script. This lower case script appears to be from a slightly different font than the other variety name letters. There are other stylistic differences. Old-fashioned Tomato Rice has the word Soup depicted lower on the can, in place of a portion of ornamental starlike symbols at the bottom that the other 31 varieties have. Also, Cheddar Cheese has two banner-like addenda. In the middle-left, a small golden banner says New!, and a middle center golden banner says Great As A Sauce Too!.|$|E
500|$|Vincent Canby of The New York Times {{said of the}} Pink Panther films, [...] "I'm {{not sure}} why Mr. Sellers and Mr. Lom are such a hilarious team, {{though it may be}} because <b>each</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> fine comic actor with a special talent for portraying the sort of all-consuming, epic {{self-absorption}} that makes slapstick farce initially acceptable—instead of alarming—and finally so funny." [...] Film critic Elvis Mitchell has said that Sellers {{was one of the few}} comic geniuses who was able to truly hide behind his characters, giving the audience no sense of what he was really like in real life. A feature of the characterisations undertaken by Sellers is that, regardless of how clumsy or idiotic they are, he ensured that they always retain their dignity. On his playing of Clouseau, Sellers said: [...] "I set out to play Clouseau with great dignity because I feel that he thinks he is probably one of the greatest detectives in the world. The original script makes him out to be a complete idiot. I thought a forgivable vanity would humanise him and make him kind of touching." [...] His biographer, Ed Sikov, notes that because of this retained dignity, Sellers is [...] "the master of playing men who have no idea how ridiculous they are." [...] Social historian Sam Wasson notes the complexity in Sellers's performances in the Pink Panther films, which has the effect of alienating Clouseau from his environment. Wesson considers that [...] "As 'low' and 'high' comedy rolled into one, it's the performative counterpoint to Edwardian sophisticated naturalism". This combination of [...] "high" [...] and [...] "low", exemplified by Clouseau's attempting to retain dignity after a fall, means that within the film Clouseau was [...] "the sole representative of humanity". Film critic Dilys Powell also saw the inherent dignity in the parts and wrote that Sellers had a [...] "balance between character and absurdity". Richard Attenborough also thought that because of his sympathy, Sellers could [...] "inject into his characterisations the frailty and substance of a human being".|$|E
