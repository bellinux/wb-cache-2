40|$|Criteria for interim {{dry storage}} of DOE owned spent nuclear fuels {{will be based}} on a {{combination}} of technical, regulatory, and political requirements. These requirements have not been fully established but will include issues such as the necessity for monitoring the fuel, retrievability of the fuel, maintenance of final disposal options, siting of <b>interim</b> <b>disposal</b> facilities (will the fuels at each site remain on that site throughout the <b>interim</b> <b>disposal</b> period?), and interfacing with the International Atomic Energy Agency over inspectability of the highly enriched fuels in the inventory. Regardless of the other requirement issues, the technical storage criteria are likely to vary with fuel type and will include: (a) a fuel specific maximum storage temperature coupled to; (b) a specific storage environment (for example, Helium gas with less than xx ppm moisture); (c) a mass limit for fissionable isotopes; and (d) provisions for prestorage characterization and, if necessary, segregation of the fuel based on the established condition of the fuel. Each of these criteria has several associated technical issues and there are significant interactions among the criteria. This white paper summarizes many of the technical issues which must be resolved in order to develop functional and design specification for the interim dry storage for DOE owned spent nuclear fuels...|$|E

Studieshave modeled the total fuel cycle costs of a reprocessing-recycling system based on one-time recycling of plutonium in existing thermal reactors (as opposed to the proposed breeder reactor cycle) and compare this to the total costs of an open fuel cycle with direct disposal. The range of results produced by these studies is very wide, but all are agreed that under current (2005) economic conditions the reprocessing-recycle option is the more costly.|$|R

At Site A, uncontained wastes were discharged through a submerged pipe into the turbulent wake of a barge. At Site B, waste materials were placed in barrels before discharge. Chemical wastes discharged at these sites reportedly had various concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons, calcium and sodium metals, formaldehyde, cyanide and other metals (i.e. antimony, mercury, arsenic, zinc, manganese, and iron). Seven permits issued by the EPA in 1973 for the period of May 1 to November 1 allowed for the disposal of 84,500 tons of uncontained waste at Site A and 208,500 waste barrels at Site B, of which 55,000 barrels contained chlorinated hydrocarbons. By July 1973, four companies with plants at 7 locations were using Sites A and B (NAS, 1975).|$|R

In order to determine theradioactive inventory destructive (e. g. α-, β-, γ-measurements according to wet chemicalsample preparation) and non-destructive (e. g. γ-scanning and neutron measurements) measurement methods are used 2. For the characterization of non-radioactive substances aprototype 3 for the assay of small-volume (50 L) samples was constructed and parameterizedusing the neutron activation analysis (NAA) with a pulsed 14 MeV neutron source. Subsequently, the non-destructive analytical method called MEDINA (Multi ElementDetection Based on Instrumental Neutron Activation) for 200 l waste drums was developed ina cooperation between RWTH Aachen University and Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH 4 5. The aim of this thesis is to investigate and characterize heterogeneous mixed samples regardingtheir material composition {{as well as their}} inhomogeneous distribution. For this purposes,studies were carried out on 200 l steel drums with heterogeneous matrices using the NAA inthe MEDINA facility. The samples are composed out of a mixture of concrete and polyethylene(PE) bodies. Due to its high hydrogen content, the PE can have a strong influence on theneutron moderation and neutron absorption and can thereby occur as a possible disturbancevariable in the characterization of the non-radioactive inventory. For these studies a pulsed 14 MeV neutron source is used to record the prompt and delayed γ-rays between the neutronpulses, separately. Thus, the performance of the MEDINA method relating to stronglymoderating mixed matrices and their characterization is studied [...] . ...|$|R

The Task Team evaluated multiple alternatives, assessing programmatic, technical, and schedule risks, and generated life-cycle cost projections for each alternative. The eight technology alternatives evaluated were: direct co-disposal; melt and dilute; reprocessing; press and dilute; glass material oxidation dissolution system (GMODS); electrometallurgical treatment; dissolve and vitrify; and plasma arc. In followup to the Business Plan that was developed to look at SNF dry storage, WSRC prepared an addendum to the cost study. This addendum estimated the costs for the modification and use of an existing (105 L) reactor facility versus a greenfield approach for new facilities (for the Direct Co-Disposal and Melt and Dilute alternatives). WSRC assessed the impacts of a delay in reprocessing due to the potential reservation of H-Canyon for other missions (i. e., down blending HEU for commercial use or the conversion of plutonium to either MOX fuel or an immobilized repository disposal form).

The fierce {{conflicts}} {{triggered by}} the wage reform caused the central government to attach great importance to {{the reconstruction of the}} system for resolving labor disputes. On April 18, 1986, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State Council enacted the Announcement of Seriously Implementing Several Provisions on Labor System Reform, and particularly pointed out that “the reform of the labor system is related to the vital interests of the masses, involving multiple aspects, requiring strong policies as backup, and is difficult to be implemented…in the process of implementing these provisions. We should pay great attention to letters and petitions from people and the disposal issues of labor disputes” (Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and State Council 1986). On July 12 of the same year, the State Council published the Notice of Issuing Four Provisions to Reform the Labor System, mentioning {{for the first time the}} reconstruction of arbitral institutes for labor disputes. On July 31, 1987, the State Council issued the Interim Provisions for the Disposal of Labor Disputes in State-owned Enterprises (hereinafter interim provisions), marking the resumption of an arbitral and litigation system that had been suspended for three decades. The main goal of rebuilding this system was to control the collective struggles of workers resulted from the reform of state-owned enterprises. In accordance with the <b>interim</b> provisions, the <b>disposal</b> system for labor disputes formed a mode of “one mediation, one arbitration, and two lawsuits.” Labor disputes in state-owned enterprises would first be mediated by mediation committees inside the enterprises. If this failed, workers could apply for labor arbitration before they refused to accept arbitral results and sued in the people’s courts.|$|R

Three decommissioning alternatives are studied: DECON (immediate decontamination), SAFSTOR (safe storage followed by deferred decontamination), and ENTOMB (entombment). Safety and costs of decommissioning are estimated by determining the impact of probable features of multiple-reactor-station operation that {{are considered to be}} unavailable at a single-reactor station, and applying these estimated impacts to the decommissioning costs and radiation doses estimated in previous PWR and BWR decommissioning studies. The multiple-reactor-station features analyzed are: the use of interim onsite nuclear waste storage with later removal to an offsite nuclear waste disposal facility, the use of permanent onsite nuclear waste disposal, the dedication of the site to nuclear power generation, and the provision of centralized services. Five scenarios for decommissioning reactors at a multiple-reactor station are investigated. The number of reactors on a site is assumed to be either four or ten; nuclear waste disposal is varied between immediate offsite <b>disposal,</b> <b>interim</b> onsite storage, and immediate onsite disposal. It is assumed that the decommissioned reactors are not replaced in one scenario but are replaced in the other scenarios. Centralized service facilities are provided in two scenarios but are not provided in the other three. Decommissioning of a PWR or a BWR at a multiple-reactor station probably will be less costly and result in lower radiation doses than decommissioning an identical reactor at a single-reactor station. Regardless of whether the light water reactor being decommissioned is at a single- or multiple-reactor station: • the estimated occupational radiation dose for decommissioning an LWR is lowest for SAFSTOR and highest for DECON • the estimated cost of decommissioning a PWR is lowest for ENTOMB and highest for SAFSTOR • the estimated cost of decommissioning a BWR is lowest for OECON and highest for SAFSTOR.
