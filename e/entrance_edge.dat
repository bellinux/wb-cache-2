40|$|An {{investigation}} of the XJ- 41 -V turbojet-engine compressor was conducted to determine {{the performance of the}} compressor and to obtain fundamental information on the aerodynamic problems associated with large centrifugal-type compressors. The results of the research conducted on the original compressor indicated the compressor would not meet the desired engine-design air-flow requirements because of an air-flow restriction in the vaned collector. The compressor air-flow choking point occurred near the entrance to the vaned-collector passage and was instigated by a poor mass-flow distribution at the vane entrance and from relatively large negative angles of attack of the air stream along the <b>entrance</b> <b>edges</b> of the vanes at the outer passage wall and large positive angles of attack at the inner passage wall. As a result of the analysis, a design change of the vaned collector entrance is recommended for improving the maximum flow capacity of the compressor...|$|R

The mathematical model proposal for the angular flow frequency calculation in the entrance pipes of the model turbomachine (pump-turbine model) is given. The model is based on the determination of the relative circulation flow in the impeller channels that appears as a consequence of the effect of the rotated impeller channels.

In the presented method, open-close iteration {{may not be}} needed, small penetration is permitted among blocks, and springs are added between contacting block pairs only when a penetration takes place. The three contact patterns (i. e. sliding, locking and opening) in original DDA method are not involved, and the recognition of these contact patterns and treatment of transformation among patterns are not required either, significantly saving the computing time. In a convex to concave contact, there are two candidate entrance edges which may cause uncertainty. In this case, we propose the angle bisector criterion to determine the <b>entrance</b> <b>edge.</b> The spring stiffness is much larger than Young's modulus in the original DDA, however {{we find that the}} correct results can still be obtained when it is much smaller than Young's modulus. Finally, the penetrations by using penalty method and augmented Lagrangian method are compared. Penetration of the latter is 1 / 4 of the former. The range of spring stiffness for the latter is wider than the former, being 0. 01 – 1 of the former. Both methods can lead to correct contact forces...|$|E

40|$|At {{the request}} of the Air Materiel Command, Army Air Forces, an {{investigation}} is being conducted at the NACA Cleveland laboratory to determine the performance characteristics of the XJ- 41 -V turbojet-engine compressor. The static-pressure variation in the direction of flow through the compressor was presented in reference 1 for an equivalent speed of 8000 rpm. An analysis of these pressure indicated that the maximum-flow limitation of the compressor was caused by separation, which reduced the effective flow area at the vaned-collector entrance. As a result of this analysis, the flow area at the vaned-collector entrance was increased to obtain larger mass flows. The area increase was obtained by cutting back the <b>entrance</b> <b>edges</b> of the collector vanes, which resulted in an increased vaneless-diffuser radius. Comparative performance of the original and revised compressors at an equivalent speed of 8000 rpm is presented.

At the Advanced Technology and Development Center of Northrop Grumman, we have routinely used these devices for characterization of injector beams with less than 20 W/cm 2 average power density. To characterize higher power beams, like those required for production of tritium or for radioactive waste transmutation, the scanner pod and data collection algorithm must be redesigned due {{to the possibility of}} melting the scanner’s protective front face or distorting the precision <b>entrance</b> knife <b>edges.</b> Among the methods we have used to mitigate these effects, one consists of drastically reducing the amount of time required for data collection. In this method, the emittance scanner pod traverses the beam in two passes, each requiring less than 0. 5 second. In the first pass, the phase space limits of the beam are determined. In the second pass, data is collected primarily within the phase space region limits determined in the first pass. In this way, enough points are collected to assure that the precision of the measurement is high, even though the data collection time for each scan is less than 0. 5 second.

A basic model for the propagation of flow is the so-called fluid queue model in which the time to traverse an edge is composed of a flow-dependent waiting time in a queue at the <b>entrance</b> of the <b>edge</b> plus a constant travel time after leaving the queue. In a dynamic network routing game each infinitesimal particle is interpreted as a player that seeks to complete its journey in the least possible time.

Equilibrium occurs when each particle travels along a shortest path.

40|$|Abstract We {{examined}} the diurnal refuges occu-pied by the nocturnal squirrelfish, Holocentrus rufus, to describe refuges {{and the behavior}} associated with their use and to determine which, if any, refuge characteristics were selected. We tagged 21 H. rufus on two sites on a fringing reef in Barbados, West Indies, identified the refuges they used (n = 57), measured ten characteristics of each refuge and the surrounding microhabitat, and monitored their refuge use for 4 weeks. To evaluate refuge selection, we measured the same characteristics on a comparable number of unused potential refuges (n = 67) on the same reefs and used classification tree models to determine which characteristics separated used from unused refuges. Each fish used 1 – 9 refuges, which did not overlap among individuals and were defended against intrusion by conspecifics and some hetero-specifics. Fish {{with more than one}} refuge frequently moved among them. There was strong site fidelity with no immigration of untagged fish or emigration of tagged fish on either reef during the study period and no additional refuges being occupied over the 4 -week period. Refuges were primarily holes, open at one or two ends, which varied in size, distance from the reef <b>edge,</b> <b>entrance</b> orientation, and vertical relief at the entrance. Holes used as refuges differed significantly from unused holes mainly in characteristics related to the vertical position of their entrance, but the classification tree models differed for the two sites. This study provides the first detailed information on characteristics of daytime refuges used by a noctur-nally active reef fish and the first evidence of selectivity of refuges.

An aggregation of more than 80 + bamboo nests of X. nasalis was discovered in Suan Pheung district, Ratch Buri province, Thailand on the 25 th of May 2012. We collected 27 nests from the site to dissect, measure the external and internal nest architecture, and analyze the pollen composition of the pollen masses. X. nasalis constructs linear unbranched nests with nest entrance mostly located at the open-end of the bamboo culms. The nest length and the branch diameter of the nest <b>entrance</b> (excluding nesting <b>edge)</b> are 25. 40 ± 6. 95 cm and 17. 94 ± 6. 00 mm, and the maximum number of provisioned cells is 8. A biased sex ratio of 8 ♀: 1 ♂ is reported, with up to 7 adults inhabiting in a single nest. 29 pollen types were identified from 14 pollen masses using an acetolysis method and visualization under both light microscope and scanning electron microscope. 13 pollen types were considered as major pollen sources (contribute ≥ 1 % in total pollen volume); however, only 10 can be identified to family and generic levels.

40|$|Diatoms are micro algae {{that live}} in moist environments. While their size and shape vary between species, they are {{typically}} on the micron scale. Although, diatoms are simple single cell organisms, they simultaneously allow selectively uptake nutrients whilst rejecting deleterious viruses and bacteria. It is still unknown how a simple organism manages to filter these different particles. A diatom is comprised of intricate nano/micro pore like features on their outer shells, known as frustules, which has been proposed {{are responsible for the}} selective uptake of particles. A commercial CFD package, CFD-ACE+ has been used for this study. To reduce complexity only one pore was simulated with three different <b>entrance</b> shapes, namely <b>edged,</b> rounded and spiked. In addition, two alternate flow conditions were used to verify the effects of different modes of operation. A fully coupled simulation, {{similar to that of the}} Immersed Boundary Method, of the particle effect on the flow field, was used to study the hydrodynamic interaction of the particle with the different entrance shapes. The more conventional modelling method for particle flow that solves the flow field independently of the particle, hence, one-way coupled simulation, was also investigated to compare to the new fully coupled particle modelling. Finally, Brownian motion was also simulated using the one-way coupled simulation to examine its role in filtration if coupled with the hydrodynamic interaction of different pore entrance shapes. The results have shown that the <b>edged</b> pore <b>entrance,</b> due to its sudden change of flow condition, is the best at rejecting particles. The spiked pore entrances also increase the instability in the flow field and enhance the rejection of particles. Like that of the diatom, the rounded edge has shown the possibility of allowing for selective uptake of different sized particles. The results for the Brownian motion simulations indicate that it dominates in the regions where the flow is insignificant. Even at the position where the Peclet number is approximately 111, the Brownian motion was clearly visible. This has lead to a belief that Brownian motion may assist the transport of the particles through the pore. It may also assist to transport particles into the pore from the regions near the wall and the pore, where the flow is insignificant and the Peclet number is small (< 1). The combined results of Brownian motion and the particle simulation on the rounded edge indicate that during when the particle is partially captured in the pore, diffusion will help transport through the pore...|$|R
