5|$|The {{electrical}} <b>discharge</b> <b>machining</b> (EDM) or {{spark erosion}} process has become {{widely used in}} mould making. As well as allowing the formation of shapes {{that are difficult to}} machine, the process allows pre-hardened moulds to be shaped so that no heat treatment is required. Changes to a hardened mould by conventional drilling and milling normally require annealing to soften the mould, followed by heat treatment to harden it again. EDM is a simple process in which a shaped electrode, usually made of copper or graphite, is very slowly lowered onto the mould surface (over a period of many hours), which is immersed in paraffin oil (kerosene). A voltage applied between tool and mould causes spark erosion of the mould surface in the inverse shape of the electrode.|$|E
5|$|Since moulds {{have been}} {{expensive}} to manufacture, they were usually only used in mass production {{where thousands of}} parts were being produced. Typical moulds are constructed from hardened steel, pre-hardened steel, aluminium, and/or beryllium-copper alloy. The choice of material to build a mould from is primarily one of economics; in general, steel moulds cost more to construct, but their longer lifespan will offset the higher initial cost over a higher number of parts made before wearing out. Pre-hardened steel moulds are less wear-resistant and are used for lower volume requirements or larger components; their typical steel hardness is 38–45 on the Rockwell-C scale. Hardened steel moulds are heat treated after machining; these are by far superior in terms of wear resistance and lifespan. Typical hardness ranges between 50 and 60 Rockwell-C (HRC). Aluminium moulds can cost substantially less, and when designed and machined with modern computerised equipment can be economical for moulding tens or even {{hundreds of thousands of}} parts. Beryllium copper is used in areas of the mould that require fast heat removal or areas that see the most shear heat generated. The moulds can be manufactured either by CNC machining or by using electrical <b>discharge</b> <b>machining</b> processes.|$|E

30|$|Because product {{thickness}} was low, a wire electric <b>discharge</b> <b>machine</b> {{was used}} for sectional processing in each product-forming stage to prevent deformation. The wire electric <b>discharge</b> <b>machine</b> hardened the product surface, affecting measurement quality. Therefore, the hardened surface layer was removed using sandpaper before obtaining relevant measurements.

Particular {{attention}} was paid to two swords wielded by Conan: his father's sword ("Master's sword") and the blade he finds in a tomb ("Atlantean sword"). [...] Both weapons were realized from Cobb's drawings. Their blades were hand ground from carbon steel and heat treated and left unsharpened. [...] The hilts and pommels were sculpted and cast through the lost-wax process; inscriptions were added to the blades by electrical <b>discharge</b> <b>machining.</b> [...] Samson and Huchthausen made four Master's and four Atlantean swords, at a cost of $10,000 per weapon.

500|$|PWM drives are {{inherently}} associated with high-frequency common-mode voltages and currents which may cause trouble with motor bearings. When these high-frequency voltages find {{a path to}} earth through a bearing, transfer of metal or electrical <b>discharge</b> <b>machining</b> (EDM) sparking occurs between the bearing's ball and the bearing's race. Over time, EDM-based sparking causes erosion in the bearing race {{that can be seen}} as a fluting pattern. In large motors, the stray capacitance of the windings provides paths for high-frequency currents that pass through the motor shaft ends, leading to a circulating type of bearing current. [...] Poor grounding of motor stators can lead to shaft-to-ground bearing currents. Small motors with poorly grounded driven equipment are susceptible to high-frequency bearing currents.|$|E
