5|$|Mrs. Tittlemouse <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tale</b> {{in which}} no humans play a part and one in which events are treated as though they have {{occurred}} since time immemorial and far from human observance. It is a simple story, and one likely to appeal to young children.|$|E
5|$|Later that year, Toei {{released}} a 143-minute movie, Yamato, {{based on a}} book by Jun Henmi, to commemorate the 60th anniversary {{of the end of}} World War II; Tamiya released special editions of scale models of the battleship in conjunction with the film's release. Based on a book of the same name, the film <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tale</b> about the sailors aboard the doomed battleship and the concepts of honour and duty. The film was shown on more than 290screens across the country and was a commercial success, taking in a record 5.11billion yen at the domestic box office.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there were}} {{calls for a}} public competition, William Wyon's son, Leonard Charles Wyon was chosen to execute the new design. Both the Queen and Prince Albert took a keen {{interest}} in the work, and repeated visits by Wyon to Buckingham Palace and Osborne House were necessary before Victoria gave her approval. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tale</b> that the Queen returned the penny sent her for final approval by post, but a postman opened the parcel, throwing away the coin in disgust when he realised all that was inside was a penny. The new bronze pieces were made current by a proclamation dated 17 December 1860, and public reaction was positive, both for Wyon's designs and for the weight, which had been halved. The new coins were widely distributed through post offices, and in 1861, the Mint began the recall of the old copper pieces, paying a small premium and for the transport. The old copper coins soon vanished from towns; progress in rural areas was more gradual. The pre-1860 copper penny was demonetised after 1869 in Britain (though accepted at full face value by the Mint until 1873) and in 1877 for the colonies.|$|E

25|$|The {{legalization of}} {{gambling}} {{for a short}} time in the 1930s attracted Hollywood visitors such as Rita Hayworth and Mafia figures such as Bugsy Siegel and Al Capone from the United States. Cuernavaca was the setting of Malcolm Lowry's Under the Volcano written in 1947. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tale</b> of despair and self-destruction due to alcoholism. In the 1950s and 1960s, the city attracted many directors, producers, and actors from Hollywood, many of whom had been blacklisted through the influence of McCarthyism.|$|E
25|$|There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tale</b> in the Hasidic Chabad {{movement}} that supposedly Joseph Stalin {{died as a}} result of some metaphysical intervention of the seventh Chabad leader, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, during the recitation of a discourse at a public Purim Farbrengen. Stalin was suddenly paralyzed on 1 March 1953, which corresponds to Purim 1953, and died 4 days later. Due to Stalin's death, nationwide pogroms against Jews throughout the Soviet Union were averted, as Stalin's infamous doctors' plot was halted.|$|E

However, the Parsi community had to abide by three rules: they had to speak the local language, follow local marriage customs, and not carry any weapons. After showing the many similarities between their faith and local beliefs, the early community was granted a plot of land on which to build a fire temple.|$|E
25|$|Luther, {{depicting}} {{the life of}} Martin Luther, the archetypal rebel of an earlier century, was first performed in 1961; it transferred to Broadway and won Osborne a Tony Award. Inadmissible Evidence was first performed in 1964. In between these plays, Osborne won an Oscar for his 1963 screenplay adaptation of Tom Jones. A Patriot for Me (1965) drawing on the Austrian Redl case, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tale</b> of turn-of-the-century homosexuality and espionage which helped to end (along with Saved by Edward Bond) the system of theatrical censorship under the Lord Chamberlain.|$|E
25|$|In October 1976, Truffaut {{showed a}} new draft to Gruault, which now {{included}} a deaf-mute child {{as the main}} character Julien Davenne's protégé, and had Davenne work as an obituary writer in a small Parisian magazine. The presence of Paul Massigny was also vital {{for the development of}} the story. Indeed, Truffaut stated that without Massigny there would be no film because it would be too static, and that The Green Room <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tale</b> in which Massigny is the anti-hero. Gruault finished a new version of the script by February 1977. Truffaut worked on it with his assistant Suzanne Schiffman and completed the final draft in May 1977.|$|E

25|$|The Navigatio Sancti Brendani (Voyage of Saint Brendan) {{fits in with}} a then-popular {{literature}} genre, {{peculiar to}} Ireland, called an immram. Irish immrama flourished during the seventh and eighth centuries. Typically, an immram <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tale</b> that describes the hero's series of seafaring adventures. (Some of these immrams involved the search for, and visits to, Tir na nOg, an island far to the west, beyond {{the edges of the}} world map.) There appear to be similarities with The Voyage of Bran written much earlier. In the Navigatio, this style of storytelling meshed with a religious ascetic tradition where Irish monks would travel alone in boats, the same way their desert brothers used to isolate themselves in caves.|$|E
25|$|A second work of fiction, {{provisionally}} titled Crazy House: Further Adventures in Chicago, contains over 10,000 handwritten pages. Written after The Realms, {{it takes}} that epic's major characters—the seven Vivian sisters and their companion/secret brother, Penrod—and places them in Chicago, with the action unfolding {{during the same}} years {{as that of the}} earlier book. Begun in 1939, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tale</b> of a house that is possessed by demons and haunted by ghosts, or has an evil consciousness of its own. Children disappear into the house and are later found brutally murdered. The Vivians and Penrod are sent to investigate and discover that the murders are the work of evil ghosts. The girls go about exorcising the place, but have to resort to arranging for a full-scale Holy Mass to be held in each room before the house is clean. They do this repeatedly, but it never works. The narrative ends mid-scene, with Darger having just been rescued from the Crazy House.|$|E

500|$|The Story of Miss Moppet <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tale</b> about teasing, {{featuring}} a kitten and a mouse, {{that was written}} and illustrated by Beatrix Potter. [...] It was published by Frederick Warne & Co for the 1906 Christmas season. Potter was born in London in 1866, and between 1902 and 1905 published a series of small format children's books with Warne. In 1906, she experimented with an atypical panorama design for Miss Moppet, which booksellers disliked; the story was reprinted in 1916 in small book format.|$|E

500|$|The film also {{received}} mixed reviews from other critics. Ananda Vikatan said, [...] "Though {{this effort to}} improve the quality of Tamil cinema must be appreciated, we do not see the dignity of the epic and only see the dominance of the extravaganza." [...] In 2012, Baradwaj Rangan called the film [...] "a historical epic with little so-called relevance to contemporary life (unless you want to acknowledge the Duryodhana-Karna storyline as the granddaddy of today's bromances)" [...] and stated that Ganesan's performance [...] "isn't as all-consuming as his performance in, say, The Mahabharata, after all, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tale</b> with an ensemble cast, unlike The Ramayana with its solo hero", while calling Rama Rao's performance a [...] "sly, campy take on Krishna".|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of their {{widespread}} popularity, especially in households with children, guinea pigs have shown a presence in culture and media. Some noted appearances of the animal in literature include the short story [...] "Pigs Is Pigs" [...] by Ellis Parker Butler, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tale</b> of bureaucratic incompetence. Two guinea pigs held at a railway station breed unchecked while humans argue as to whether they are [...] "pigs" [...] or [...] "pets" [...] for the purpose of determining freight charges. Butler's story, in turn, inspired the [...] episode [...] "The Trouble With Tribbles", written by David Gerrold. In the Golden Hamster Saga books, two guinea pigs named Enrico and Caruso are modern-day thespians (named after Enrico Caruso) who serve as secondary characters, and often irritate the main character, Freddy Auratus, who strongly dislikes their acting antics.|$|E

This sentiment was echoed in The Queen: The Lady's Newspaper, with the reviewer pronouncing that [...] "this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tale</b> {{in the hands of a}} writer not so able as Mr. Haggard might easily have become absurd; but he has treated it with so much vividness and picturesque power as to invest it with unflagging interest, and given to the mystery a port of philosophic possibility that makes us quite willing to submit to the illusion.|$|E
