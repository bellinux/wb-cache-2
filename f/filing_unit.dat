The present research was done to survey the medical records filing in Khorramabad teaching hospitals affiliated to Lorestan university of medical sciences in 2009. Materials and Methods: This research is a cross-sectional descriptive-analytic study. Data was collected using check-lists and questionnaires based on medical <b>filing</b> <b>unit</b> standards, and by observation and interview. Completed check-lists were analyzed using analysis limit and grading method by SPSS software. Questionnaire was utilized for qualitative evaluation of medical <b>filing</b> <b>unit</b> to analyze and clarify the medical filing situation with all the details in each hospital. Results: The desirability degree of physical location and space, staff, medical records storage and retrieval system, equipment, procedures and guidelines and mechanized system of medical <b>filing</b> <b>unit</b> in the foresaid hospitals with 41 % overall score percentage was “average”, and the highest percentage of compliance with the standard system belonged to mechanized system (48 / 8 %), while the lowest one (26 %) was related to physical location and space.

Therefore, the use of storage and retrieval modern technologies of medical record, such as establishing electronic medical filing, scanning and digital storing of medical records with fast retrieval capability cause result in Improvement in efficiency and performance of this important unit, optimum use of resources, cost saving and enhancement of patient care...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aim: Analysis of {{efficiency}} in hospitals, {{as the most}} expensive operating unit of the health system, is very important. This costly unit has several departments {{that one of them}} is medical records. This study is trying to analyze the efficiency of medical records department for the enhancement of using medical records facilities. Materials and Methods: In this study, technical, scale and managerial efficiency of medical records department has been studied by data envelopment analysis method, and assuming the scale efficiency variable and the input axis. Information used in this study was the input variables (number of technician personnel and lower and Master of Science personnel and higher), output variables (number of emergency and outpatient and inpatient medical records and the number of <b>filing</b> <b>unit</b> visitors to respond) during 2007 - 2009. Results: The average technical efficiency of medical records departments is 84 percent, that indicates there is at least 16 percent capacity for an increase in performance. Average of management and scale Performance in units during the 3 years of study are 95 and 89 percent respectively. Most input surplus is relevant to technician and lower personnel. The average performance of these units in general hospitals is 80 percent and in specialized activities is 92 percent. Discussion and Conclusion: Relationship between studied indicators in this study with performance medical records departments showed that using such as employee personnel with undergraduate degrees and higher and educated in medical records filed, the use of managers with enough experience in this department and more use of computer systems for unit activities can fill 16 percent capacity of performance improvement in these units...|$|E

Any decision-making and rational planning in order to increase the productivity and survey the effect of adopted decision on the organization performance is in relation to the accurate assessment of financial performance. The aim of this study was to investigate the process of collection and turnover of receivables and rules of hospital budget in Qom University of medical sciences during the fourth and fifth development plans. 						Materials and Methods: This is a descriptive-analytic and cross-sectional study. It was used from researcher-made forms for collecting data. The data after collection from financial <b>filing</b> <b>unit</b> entered to the excel software and then the period of receivables collection, circulation of receivables,average daily sales and average intake accounts were analyzed,using activity ratios formula. 						Results: Our findings show that during the fourth and fifth development programs, the turnover of receivables decreased from four times to three times in the year and it is less than the least standard that is five times in the year. The period of receivables collection increased from 72 days to 147 days and it is more than the maximum standard that is 67 days. This issue is the indication of bad situations of insurance companies of under-contract with hospitals in paying of their obligations during study period. 						 					 				 			 			 			 		 	 Conclusion: The period of collection and turnover of receivables of selected hospitals takes distance from the standard amount that needs to intervention at the macro level of decision-making. This study showed that resorting to legal leverage over the fourth and fifth development plan have not any impact on the improvement of reimbursement process. Therefore, the practical action of politicians about reformation of insurance’s structure and review of the ways of financing can be effective...|$|E

The bomb, which police estimated to {{be the equivalent of}} 25 sticks of dynamite, was placed in a hallway just off the elevators some time during the evening and it exploded at around 10:30PM. The injured were on the night shift in the bank's stock bookkeeping department and were working {{on the other side of}} the corridor wall.
