5|$|<b>Dancing</b> is {{a popular}} pastime in Wales; {{traditional}} dances include folk <b>dancing</b> and clog <b>dancing.</b> The first mention of <b>dancing</b> in Wales is in a 12th-century account by Giraldus Cambrensis, but by the 19th century traditional dance had all but died out; this is attributed {{to the influence of}} Nonconformists and their belief that any physical diversion was worthless and satanic, especially mixed <b>dancing.</b> These ancient dances, orally passed down, were almost single-handedly rescued by Lois Blake (1890–1974) who recorded them in numerous instruction pamphlets, recording both steps and music. In a similar vein, clog <b>dancing</b> was preserved and developed by the likes of Howel Wood (1882–1967) who perpetuated the art at local and national stages. Clog <b>dancing,</b> traditionally a male dominated art, is now a common part of eisteddfodau. In 2010, a 30-year traditional dance festival held in Caernarvon came to an end {{due to a lack of}} participants, though clog <b>dancing</b> has seen a revival in the 21st century.|$|E

5|$|Although {{certain forms}} of dance were disapproved of at times as non-Roman or unmanly, <b>dancing</b> was {{embedded}} in religious rituals of archaic Rome, {{such as those of}} the <b>dancing</b> armed Salian priests and of the Arval Brothers, priesthoods which underwent a revival during the Principate. Ecstatic <b>dancing</b> was a feature of the international mystery religions, particularly the cult of Cybele as practised by her eunuch priests the Galli and of Isis. In the secular realm, <b>dancing</b> girls from Syria and Cadiz were extremely popular.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{resurgence}} of interest in tap <b>dancing</b> in the 1980s, Sandman Sims served as a cultural ambassador, representing the United States with dance performances around the world. He was featured in the 1989 dance film Tap, along with Sammy Davis Jr., Gregory Hines and Savion Glover, demonstrating classic challenge <b>dancing.</b> Sims also appeared in a 1990 episode of The Cosby Show as Rudy's tap <b>dancing</b> teacher, facing off against Cliff (Bill Cosby) in a good-natured tap challenge.|$|E

5|$|Riefenstahl {{attended}} <b>dancing</b> academies {{and became}} {{well known for}} her self-styled interpretive <b>dancing</b> skills, traveling across Europe with Max Reinhardt in a show funded by Jewish producer Harry Sokal. Riefenstahl often made almost 700 Reichmarks for each performance and was so dedicated to <b>dancing</b> that she gave filmmaking no thought. She began to suffer a series of foot injuries that led to knee surgery that threatened her <b>dancing</b> career. It was while going to a doctor's appointment that she first saw a poster for the 1924 film Der Berg des Schicksals ("The Mountain of Destiny"). She became inspired to go into movie making, and began visiting the cinema to see films and also attended film shows.|$|E

5|$|Already lightly {{regarded}} {{because he}} was selected by the Democratic Central Committee instead of a party primary, Fields further weakened his position due {{to some of his}} personal preferences. A devout Methodist and prohibitionist, Fields prohibited both <b>dancing</b> and drinking at the Executive Mansion. He moved the inaugural ball from the mansion to the capitol rotunda, where <b>dancing</b> would be allowed, but he and his wife did not attend.
