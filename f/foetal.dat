5|$|Mammals are amniotes, {{and most}} are viviparous, giving birth to live young. The {{exception}} to this are the egg-laying monotremes, the platypus and the echidnas of Australia. Most other mammals have a placenta through which the developing foetus obtains nourishment, but in marsupials, the <b>foetal</b> stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mother's pouch where it latches on to a nipple and completes its development.|$|E
5|$|The oldest dinosaur embryos ever {{discovered}} {{were found}} in the park in 1978. The eggs were from the Triassic Period (220 to 195 million years ago) and had fossilised <b>foetal</b> skeletons of Massospondylus, a prosauropod dinosaur. More examples of these eggs have since been found in the park. Other fossils found in the park include those of advanced cynodontia (canine toothed animals), small thecodontia (animals with teeth set firmly in the jaw), bird-like and crocodile-like dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Details of Carol's death were {{revealed}} in the post mortem. There were severe injuries to the skull, and {{it was said that}} her face had been smashed by multiple blows. It was later found in court that the murder weapon had been an ice axe. The body was found to be in a <b>foetal</b> position, which suggested that the body had been dealt with within a few hours of death, before rigor mortis could settle in. It has since been said that the investigators failed to acknowledge that rigor mortis passes in a 24‑to48‑hour time period, and that the body could feasibly have been trussed once rigor mortis had passed. Many unusual knots were used to tie the body, and the same knots were said to be used in Gordon Park's house and boat. This was one of the key pieces of evidence used against Gordon in the trial.|$|E
25|$|Induction is {{a method}} of artificially or prematurely {{stimulating}} labour in a woman. Reasons to induce can include pre-eclampsia, <b>foetal</b> distress, placental malfunction, intrauterine growth retardation and failure to progress through labour increasing the risk of infection and <b>foetal</b> distresses.|$|E
25|$|<b>Foetal</b> haematocrit for the {{assessment}} of <b>foetal</b> anemia, Rh isoimmunization, or hydrops can be determined by percutaneous umbilical blood sampling (PUBS), which is done by placing a needle through the abdomen into the uterus and taking a portion of the umbilical cord.|$|E
25|$|Uterine rupture {{can occur}} during {{obstructed}} labour and endanger <b>foetal</b> and maternal life.|$|E
25|$|The key {{evidence}} supporting this allegation was the jumpsuit, {{as well as}} a highly contentious forensic report claiming to have found evidence of <b>foetal</b> haemoglobin in stains on {{the front seat of the}} Chamberlains' 1977 Torana hatchback. <b>Foetal</b> haemoglobin is present in infants six months and younger; Azaria was nine weeks old at the time of her disappearance.|$|E

25|$|In domesticated livestock, single-nucleotide polymorphisms in {{imprinted}} genes influencing <b>foetal</b> {{growth and}} development {{have been shown to}} be associated with economically important production traits in cattle, sheep and pigs.|$|E
25|$|Obstetric {{ultrasonography}} {{is routinely}} used for dating the gestational {{age of a}} pregnancy from {{the size of the}} fetus, determine the number of fetuses and placentae, evaluate for an ectopic pregnancy and first trimester bleeding, the most accurate dating being in first trimester before the growth of the foetus has been significantly influenced by other factors. Ultrasound is also used for detecting congenital anomalies (or other <b>foetal</b> anomalies) and determining the biophysical profiles (BPP), which are generally easier to detect in the second trimester when the <b>foetal</b> structures are larger and more developed. Specialised ultrasound equipment can also evaluate the blood flow velocity in the umbilical cord, looking to detect a decrease/absence/reversal or diastolic blood flow in the umbilical artery.|$|E
25|$|The only rabbit to {{be widely}} domesticated is the European rabbit, {{which has been}} {{extensively}} domesticated for food or as a pet. It was first widely kept in ancient Rome, where <b>foetal</b> rabbits were known as laurices and considered a delicacy, and has been refined into {{a wide variety of}} breeds during and since the Middle Ages.|$|E
25|$|Thyroid {{disease in}} {{pregnancy}} can, if uncorrected, cause {{adverse effects on}} <b>foetal</b> and maternal well-being. The deleterious effects of thyroid dysfunction can also extend beyond pregnancy and delivery to affect neurointellectual development in the early life of the child. Demand for thyroid hormones is increased during pregnancy, and may cause a previously unnoticed thyroid disorder to worsen.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{a lack of}} folic acid, a vitamin B, in {{the diet}} of a mother can cause {{cellular}} neural tube deformities that result in spina bifida. Congenital disorders such as a neural tube deformity (NTD) can be prevented by 72% if the mother consumes 4 milligrams of folic acid before the conception and after 12 weeks of pregnancy. Folic acid, or vitamin B9, aids {{the development of the}} <b>foetal</b> nervous system.|$|E
25|$|Fetal {{hemoglobin}}, or <b>foetal</b> haemoglobin, (also hemoglobin F, HbF, or α2γ2) is {{the main}} oxygen transport protein in the human fetus during the last seven months of development in the uterus and persists in the newborn until roughly 6 months old. Functionally, fetal hemoglobin differs most from adult hemoglobin {{in that it is}} able to bind oxygen with greater affinity than the adult form, giving the developing fetus better access to oxygen from the mother's bloodstream.|$|E
25|$|The Australian {{obstetrician}} William McBride and the German paediatrician Widukind Lenz suspected a {{link between}} birth defects and the drug, a theory Lenz proved in 1961. McBride was later awarded a number of honors, including a medal and prize money by L'Institut de la Vie in Paris. Further animal tests were conducted by Dr George Somers, Chief Pharmacologist of Distillers Company in Britain, which showed <b>foetal</b> abnormalities in rabbits. Similar results were also published showing these effects in rats and other species.|$|E
25|$|In 1979, Galaburda and Kemper and Galaburda et al. 1985, {{reported}} {{observations from}} {{the examination of}} post autopsy brains of people with dyslexia. Observed anatomical differences in the language center in a dyslexic brain, showing microscopic cortical malformations known as s and more rarely vascular micro-malformations {{and in some instances}} these cortical malformations appeared as a microgyrus. These studies and those of Cohen et al. 1989, suggested abnormal cortical development which was presumed to occur before or during the sixth month of <b>foetal</b> brain development.|$|E
25|$|The {{conflict}} between {{the size of the}} human <b>foetal</b> brain at birth, (which cannot be larger than about 400cm3, else it will not get through the mother's pelvis) and the size needed for an adult brain (about 1400cm3), means the brain of a newborn child is quite immature. The most vital things in human life (locomotion, speech) just have to wait while the brain grows and matures. That {{is the result of the}} birth compromise. Much of the problem comes from our upright bipedal stance, without which our pelvis could be shaped more suitably for birth. Neanderthals had a similar problem.|$|E
25|$|In her defence, {{eyewitness}} {{evidence was}} presented of dingoes having {{been seen in}} the area on the evening of 17 August 1980. All witnesses claimed to believe the Chamberlains' story. One witness, a nurse, also reported having heard a baby's cry after the time when the prosecution alleged Azaria had been murdered. Evidence was also presented that adult blood also passed the test used for <b>foetal</b> haemoglobin, and that other organic compounds can produce similar results on that particular test, including mucus from the nose and chocolate milkshakes, both of which had been present in the vehicle where Azaria was allegedly murdered.|$|E
25|$|Abortion in Morocco is illegal. According to Article 453 of the Penal Code, {{abortion}} was only allowed if the mother's physical health was threatened. An amendment to Morocco's abortion law {{has recently been}} approved. The new amendment allows abortion in cases of rape, incest and <b>foetal</b> impairment. The debate on Morocco's abortion law was opened after the Moroccan Association for the Fight against Clandestine Abortion AMLAC reported that 800 illegal abortions were performed daily nationwide. Dr. Chafik Chraibi, former head of gynaecology and obstetrics at the Matérnité des Orangers in Rabat, Morocco and founder of AMLAC was behind the study.|$|E
25|$|Dexamethasone {{has also}} been used during {{pregnancy}} as an off-label prenatal treatment for the symptoms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) in female fetuses. CAH causes a variety of physical abnormalities, notably ambiguous genitalia in girls. Early prenatal CAH treatment {{has been shown to}} reduce some CAH symptoms, but it does not treat the underlying congenital disorder. This use is controversial: it is inadequately studied, only around one in ten of the foetuses of women treated are at risk of the condition, and serious adverse events have been documented. Experimental use of dexamethasone in pregnancy for <b>foetal</b> CAH treatment was discontinued in Sweden when one in five cases suffered adverse events.|$|E
25|$|The studies {{comparing}} {{the levels of}} sertraline and its principal metabolite, desmethylsertraline, in mother's blood to their concentration in umbilical cord blood {{at the time of}} delivery indicated that <b>foetal</b> exposure to sertraline and its metabolite is approximately a third of the maternal exposure. Concentration of sertraline and desmethylsertraline in breast milk is highly variable and, on average, is of the same order of magnitude as their concentration in the blood plasma of the mother. As a result, more than half of breast-fed babies receive less than 2mg/day of sertraline and desmethylsertraline combined, and in most cases these substances are undetectable in their blood. No changes in serotonin uptake by the platelets of breast-fed infants were found, as measured by their blood serotonin levels before and after their mothers began sertraline treatment.|$|E
25|$|In England and Wales, sex {{education}} is not compulsory in schools as parents can refuse to let their children {{take part in the}} lessons. The curriculum focuses on the reproductive system, <b>foetal</b> development, and the physical and emotional changes of adolescence, while information about contraception and safe sex is discretionary and discussion about relationships is often neglected. Britain {{has one of the highest}} teenage pregnancy rates in Europe and {{sex education}} is a heated issue in government and media reports. In a 2000 study by the University of Brighton, many 14- to 15-year-olds reported disappointment with the content of sex education lessons and felt that lack of confidentiality prevents teenagers from asking teachers about contraception. However, in a 2008 study conducted by YouGov for Channel 4 it was revealed that only three in ten teenagers say they need more sex and relationships education. In most primary/junior schools, students are taught a (non-compulsory) formal sex education program from Upper Key Stage 2 (ages 10–11), and then onwards into secondary school, where it becomes a topic in the overall subject of Citizenship or PSHE (Personal Social Health Education). In March 2017 it was made complusory all schools have to teach sex education.|$|E
500|$|Budge {{excavated}} all {{the bodies}} {{from the same}} grave site. Two were identified as male and one as female, with the others being of undetermined gender. The bodies {{were given to the}} British Museum in 1900. Some grave-goods were documented at the time of excavation as [...] "pots and flints", however they were not passed on to the British Museum and their whereabouts remain unknown. Three of the bodies were found with coverings of different types (reed matting, palm fibre and an animal skin), which still remain with the bodies. The bodies were found in <b>foetal</b> positions lying on their left sides.|$|E
500|$|Some other {{possible}} roles of APOA5 variants have been discussed, but generally these reports comprise {{only one or}} two papers – and first original papers with positive findings are usually not confirmed in second publications. These papers focus on the possible effect of different APOA5 variants on maternal height, longer <b>foetal</b> birth length, putative associations with plasma levels of C-reactive protein, LDL particle size and haemostatic markers. [...] Despite the very low plasma concentration, variants within apolipoprotein A5 are potent determinants of plasma triglyceride levels. Minor alleles of three SNPs (rs662799, rs3135506, rs3135507) are associated with the higher risk of cardiovascular disease.|$|E
500|$|Make-up artist Greg Cannom {{was pleased}} to be {{involved}} in Hannibal as it offered him the chance to produce [...] "incredible and original make-ups". For Mason Verger, the make-up team would initially produce 20 different heads which looked like zombies and did not reflect the vision Scott had of the character; Scott wanted Verger to look real with hideous scarring, and not something from the [...] "House of Wax". Scott himself would actually call up the help of expert doctors {{in an effort to get}} the look of the character as realistic as possible. Scott showed the make-up team pictures of <b>foetal</b> things, which he thought touching; he wanted to make Mason Verger more touching than monstrous, as he thought of Verger as being someone who hadn’t lost his sense of humour...almost sympathetic. Oldman would spend six hours a day in make-up to prepare for the role.|$|E
500|$|Anne's final {{pregnancy}} {{ended on}} 25 January 1700, when she miscarried a stillborn son. She had been pregnant at least seventeen times over as many years, and had miscarried or {{given birth to}} stillborn children at least twelve times. Of her five liveborn children, four died before reaching the age of two. Anne suffered from bouts of [...] "gout", pains in her limbs and eventually stomach and head, from at least 1698. Based on her <b>foetal</b> losses and physical symptoms, she may have had disseminated lupus erythematosus, or Hughes syndrome. Alternatively, pelvic inflammatory disease could explain why the onset of her symptoms roughly coincided with her penultimate pregnancy. Other suggested causes of her failed pregnancies are listeriosis, diabetes, intrauterine growth retardation, and rhesus incompatibility. Rhesus incompatibility, however, generally worsens with successive pregnancies, and so does not fit with the pattern of Anne's pregnancies, as her only son to survive infancy, Prince William, Duke of Gloucester, was born {{after a series of}} stillbirths. Experts also rule out syphilis, porphyria and pelvic deformation as incompatible with her medical history.|$|E

2500|$|Words {{that can}} be spelled either way in British English include encyclopaedia, homoeopathy, chamaeleon, mediaeval (a minor variant in both AmE and BrE), foetid and foetus.

But it was later shown that these tests were highly unreliable and that similar tests, conducted on a [...] "sound deadener" [...] sprayed on during the manufacture of the car, had yielded virtually identical results.|$|E
