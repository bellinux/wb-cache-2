40|$|The rate of {{synthesis}} and catabolism of sarcoplasmic- and myofibrillar-muscle protein {{was measured}} <b>in</b> <b>operated,</b> sham-operated and food-restricted rats by using Na 2 14 CO 3. The food-restricted group underwent sham operations and {{were limited to}} the food intake of the operated animals. Protein synthesis and catabolism were increased in the sarcoplasmic-muscle fraction <b>in</b> <b>operated</b> rats compared with that in sham-operated or food-restricted rats. The rate of synthesis of the myofibrillar protein decreased <b>in</b> <b>operated</b> animals, but the rate of catabolism was not altered in the myofibrillar-muscle fraction of the operated animals compared with that in food-restricted and sham-operated animals. <b>In</b> the <b>operated</b> animals, there was {{a net loss of}} protein from the muscle. Thus the rats that underwent surgery lost muscle protein, primarily {{as a result of a}} decrease in synthesis of myofibrillar protein. The changes in protein turnover <b>in</b> <b>operated</b> animals were not due to decreases in food intake, since protein turnover in sham-operated animals that were restricted to the food intake of the operated rats was not different from that in sham-operated rats fed ad libitum...|$|R

5|$|Although space vector {{pulse-width}} modulation (SVPWM) {{is becoming}} increasingly popular, sinusoidal PWM (SPWM) is the most straightforward method used to vary drives' motor voltage (or current) and frequency. With SPWM control (see Fig. 1), quasi-sinusoidal, variable-pulse-width output is constructed from intersections of a saw-toothed carrier signal with a modulating sinusoidal signal which is variable <b>in</b> <b>operating</b> frequency {{as well as in}} voltage (or current).|$|E
5|$|As time passed, {{a number}} of serious {{concerns}} confronted the company. Enron had recently faced several serious operational challenges, namely logistical difficulties <b>in</b> <b>operating</b> a new broadband communications trading unit, and the losses from constructing the Dabhol Power project, a large power plant in India. There was also increasing criticism of the company for the role that its subsidiary Enron Energy Services had in the California electricity crisis of 2000–2001.|$|E
5|$|In later years, Ernest Aris would blatantly plagiarise {{not only}} the Peter Rabbit {{character}} in his The Treasure Seekers but Jemima in his Mrs. Beak Duck. Potter was restrained when alerted to the imitations: she praised his technical artistry but chastised him {{for a lack of}} originality. At the time, her eyesight was deteriorating and her days were heavily invested <b>in</b> <b>operating</b> her farm; her restraint with Aris may be attributed to her desire to enlist him as a collaborator.|$|E

5|$|India {{was also}} viewed as another {{potential}} operator of the Su-33. The Indian Navy planned {{to acquire the}} Su-33 for its aircraft carrier, the INS Vikramaditya, the refurbished Soviet Admiral Gorshkov, which was sold to India in 2004. In the end, the rival MiG-29K was opted for, because of the Su-33's outdated avionics. The size of the Su-33 reportedly led to concerns over potential difficulties <b>in</b> <b>operating</b> it off the Indian carriers, a constraint not shared by the smaller MiG-29K.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{congestion}} charge introduction in 2003, over £1.2 billion has been invested in transport through December 2013, including £960 million on {{improvements to the}} bus network; £102 million on roads and bridges; £70 million on road safety; £51 million on local transport/borough plans; and £36 million on sustainable transport and the environment. There has been criticism because during the first ten years since the scheme was implemented, gross revenue reached about £2.6 billion, but only £1.2 billion has been invested, meaning that 54% of gross revenues have been spent <b>in</b> <b>operating</b> the system and administrative expenses.|$|E

5|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{action of}} iodine is quick and works at low concentrations, {{and thus it}} is used <b>in</b> <b>operating</b> theatres. Its specific mode of action is unknown. It penetrates into microorganisms and attacks particular amino acids (such as cysteine and methionine), nucleotides, and fatty acids, ultimately resulting in cell death. It also has an antiviral action, but nonlipid viruses and parvoviruses are less sensitive than lipid enveloped viruses. Iodine probably attacks surface proteins of enveloped viruses, and it may also destabilise membrane fatty acids by reacting with unsaturated carbon bonds.|$|E
5|$|The {{continued}} {{financial problems}} with Seattle Transit put the Blue Streak program in jeopardy, leading to calls {{to suspend the}} program before it launched. Service was originally slated to begin in 1968, and delays led {{to the federal government}} establishing a deadline in early 1969 for a city decision on whether to move forward. A park and ride lot in Northgate was secured in August 1969, settling the demands of the federal government. The United States Department of Transportation approved $2 million <b>in</b> <b>operating</b> funds for Blue Streak in January 1970, providing two-thirds of the system's operating budget for {{the first two years of}} service.|$|E
5|$|Then-Lieutenant Alessandro Guidoni {{proposed}} in 1912 to convert Piemonte into {{an aircraft carrier}} capable of operating seaplanes and fixed-wheel aircraft. His projected reconstruction would have seen an inclined flight deck erected on the aft half of the ship, tall enough to clear the ships' funnels. The Regia Marina were not interested <b>in</b> <b>operating</b> wheeled aircraft at sea and so the idea was not pursued. In 1913, the last two of the ship's 6-inch guns were replaced with 4.7-inch guns in another attempt to lighten the ship.|$|E

40|$|This study {{compares the}} direct and {{indirect}} costs of conservative and minimally invasive treatment for undisplaced scaphoid fractures. Costs data concerning groups of non-operated and operated patients were analysed. Direct costs were higher <b>in</b> <b>operated</b> patients. Although highly variable, indirect costs were significantly smaller <b>in</b> <b>operated</b> patients and the total costs were higher in non-operated patients. In conclusion, operative treatment of scaphoid fractures is initially more expensive than conservative treatment but markedly decreases the work compensation costs...|$|R
5|$|A deal {{to upgrade}} {{several of the}} Chinooks was reached in May 1991. Under this arrangement, seven of the {{surviving}} CH-47Cs were sold to the US Army for $A40 million, the funds being used to partly {{cover the cost of}} upgrading the remaining four to CH-47D standard. The total cost of the project was $A62 million, of which $A42 million was required to upgrade the four helicopters and the remainder for spare parts, administration and new facilities for the Chinooks at Townsville. All eleven Chinooks were shipped to the United States in September 1993, and the upgraded helicopters returned to Australia in 1995. It was decided to transfer the Chinooks to the Australian Army, as by this time the RAAF no longer had significant expertise <b>in</b> <b>operating</b> the type and doing so would concentrate all of the ADF's battlefield helicopters with the same service.|$|E
5|$|As {{a part of}} the Pennsylvania system, the CL {{continued}} to operate its own property (which included the line north of Dodds after 1914) until January 1, 1921, when it was leased to the Pennsylvania. Starting at the end of 1918, the Interstate Commerce Commission classified the CL as a Class I railroad, meaning that it made at least $1 million per year <b>in</b> <b>operating</b> revenue. (This designation was dropped in 1921 when the CL was leased.) However, net operating income, revenue minus costs, which had steadily climbed from the 1890s, began falling in 1916, becoming a deficit in 1920. Subsequently, effective January 1, 1926, the Pennsylvania merged the CL with several other small companies—the Cleveland, Akron and Cincinnati Railway, Manufacturers Railway, Pennsylvania-Detroit Railroad, and Toledo, Columbus and Ohio River Railroadto create the Pennsylvania, Ohio and Detroit Railroad, a non-operating subsidiary. That company was merged into the Connecting Railway, previously a short link in Philadelphia, in 1956, and its lessee merged with the New York Central Railroad in 1968 to form Penn Central Transportation.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, the American Budd Company, at {{the time}} a {{relatively}} obscure auto-frame supplier, developed an extensive working relationship with the French firm Michelin, which was best known for its tires. In 1929, Michelin built its first rail car, and by 1932 nine of its cars were <b>in</b> <b>operating</b> service, all of which featured innovative and distinctive pneumatic tires. The company claimed that its application of tires on its rail cars afforded both a substantially more cushioned ride and increased the cars' traction by 35%. The design of Michelin's tired wheels included an aluminum safety ring and a flange that were only used {{in the event of a}} puncture or other type of tire failure; during normal operation, only the rubber tire made contact with the rail.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{dissolution}} of the Filipino Premier League, the Football Alliance sought to renew the interest of Filipinos in football. The Alliance entered into discussions with the United Football Clubs Association for the possibility of establishing another top-flight football competition in the Philippines. Instead of creating a whole system and competition, the United Football Clubs Association agreed to partner with the Football Alliance <b>in</b> <b>operating</b> the United Football League (UFL), a semi-professional league. After the league's second season, AKTV became its official TV broadcaster with the signing of a ₱150 million (~$3.3 million or ~€2.5 million), five-year deal, which ensures the airing of two live matches every week. The deal was further improved with a new TV arrangement in which four live matches would be aired every week on primetime television on AksyonTV.|$|E
5|$|The 1928 {{accident}} inquiry did not attach {{blame to}} the Southern Railway for track maintenance or locomotive performance issues, {{and noted that}} the prototype had run for eight years over the same stretch of line without complaint. However, it identified the Brighton batch and No.A890 as being more susceptible to rolling on sharp curves with weak rail joints, although the entire class operated without incident on the former LBSCR network. The management of the Southern Railway realised that to have any success <b>in</b> <b>operating</b> the Kclass tanks on {{other parts of the}} network, vast stretches of track would require upgrading. With the prospect of storing 20 locomotives whilst the necessary upgrading took place, the management recommended the class be fully withdrawn from service. To recoup the expense of constructing the engines, Maunsell was given permission to rebuild them to the new SR Uclass 2-6-0 tender engine design in 1928. This decision also reduced the adverse publicity generated by the accident. However, many of the components discarded during the rebuilding process would later be re-used on another 2-6-4 tank locomotive designed to haul heavy freight on short trips: the 3-cylinder Wclass of 1932.|$|E
5|$|The {{landing craft}} used {{included}} twelve actual World War II examples, 10 LCVPs and 2 LCMs, standing {{in for the}} British LCAs that the Ranger Companies rode in to the beach during Operation Overlord. The filmmakers used underwater cameras to better depict soldiers being hit by bullets in the water. Forty barrels of fake blood were used to simulate the effect {{of blood in the}} seawater. This degree of realism was more difficult to achieve when depicting World War II German armored vehicles, as few examples survive <b>in</b> <b>operating</b> condition. The Tiger I tanks in the film were copies built on the chassis of old, but functional, Soviet T-34 tanks. The two vehicles described in the film as Panzers were meant to portray Marder III tank destroyers. One was created for the film using the chassis of a Czech-built Panzer 38(t) tank similar to the construction of the original Marder III; the other was a cosmetically modified Swedish SAV m/43 assault gun, which also used the 38(t) chassis.|$|E
