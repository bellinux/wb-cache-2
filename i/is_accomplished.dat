5|$|Communication among North American river otters <b>is</b> <b>accomplished</b> {{mainly by}} {{olfactory}} and auditory signals. Scent marking is imperative for intergroup communication. The river otter scent-marks with feces, urine, and possibly anal sac secretions. Musk from the scent glands {{may also be}} secreted when otters are frightened or angry.|$|E
5|$|Gas {{exchange}} and excretion <b>is</b> <b>accomplished</b> by diffusion through the tentacles and {{internal and external}} body wall, aided by the movement of fluid being wafted along these surfaces by cilia. The sensory system consists of simple nerve nets in the gastrodermis and epidermis, {{but there are no}} specialised sense organs.|$|E
5|$|Most often, {{musicians are}} {{concerned}} not to produce noise, but to minimise it. Noise reduction {{is of particular}} concern in sound recording.

50|$|Absent-mindedness can {{be avoided}} or fixed in several ways. Although it can't <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> through medical procedures, it can <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> through {{psychological}} treatments. Examples include: altering work schedules to make them shorter, having frequent rest periods and utilizing a drowsy-operator warning device.|$|R
50|$|Protection can <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> {{through a}} {{traditional}} insurance policy for workers’ compensation coverage. Coverage can also <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> {{by way of}} compliance with various State self-insurance laws (usually reserved for larger employers) requiring substantial bonding and self-funding. For example, public agencies are usually permissibly self-insured.|$|R
5|$|Parallel computing, on {{the other}} hand, uses {{multiple}} processing elements simultaneously to solve a problem. This <b>is</b> <b>accomplished</b> by breaking the problem into independent parts so that each processing element can execute its part of the algorithm simultaneously with the others. The processing elements can be diverse and include resources such as a single computer with multiple processors, several networked computers, specialized hardware, or any combination of the above.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight of}} the Alpine chough is swift and acrobatic with loose deep wing beats. Its high {{manoeuvrability}} <b>is</b> <b>accomplished</b> by fanning the tail, folding its wings, and soaring in the updraughts at cliff faces. Even in flight, it can be distinguished from the red-billed chough by its less rectangular wings, and longer, less square-ended tail.|$|E

5|$|For {{infants and}} young children, orotracheal {{intubation}} {{is easier than}} the nasotracheal route. Nasotracheal intubation carries a risk of dislodgement of adenoids and nasal bleeding. Despite the greater difficulty, nasotracheal intubation route is preferable to orotracheal intubation in children undergoing intensive care and requiring prolonged intubation because this route allows a more secure fixation of the tube. As with adults, {{there are a number}} of devices specially designed for assistance with difficult tracheal intubation in children. Confirmation of proper position of the tracheal tube <b>is</b> <b>accomplished</b> as with adult patients.|$|E
5|$|Munitions and {{ammunition}} handling <b>is</b> <b>accomplished</b> using a Babcock designed highly mechanised weapons handling system (HMWHS). This {{is a first}} naval application of a common land-based warehouse system. The HMWHS moves palletised munitions from the magazines and weapon preparation areas, along track ways and via several lifts, forward and aft or port and starboard. The tracks can carry a pallet to magazines, the hangar, weapons preparation areas, and the flight deck. In a change from normal procedures the magazines are unmanned, the movement of pallets is controlled from a central location, and manpower is only required when munitions are being initially stored or prepared for use. This system speeds up delivery and reduces {{the size of the}} crew by automation.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises {{and other}} smaller cetaceans, mainly dolphins, are hunted in an {{activity}} known as drive hunting. This <b>is</b> <b>accomplished</b> by driving a pod together with boats and usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the ocean with other boats or nets. Porpoises are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the Solomon Islands, the Faroe Islands, Peru, and Japan, the most well-known practitioner of this method. By numbers, porpoises are mostly hunted for their meat, though some end up in dolphinariums. Despite the controversial nature of the hunt resulting in international criticism, and the possible health risk that the high methylmercury levels impose, thousands of porpoises are caught in drive hunts each year.|$|E

5|$|Space itself {{possesses}} symmetry. It {{looks the}} same no matter how one rotates it, and the resulting rotational symmetry {{is referred to as}} isotropy of space. In the present case it is common to use passive rotations, meaning that the observer rotates themself. Mathematically, the active operation of a rotation is performed by multiplying position vectors by a rotation matrix. A passive rotation <b>is</b> <b>accomplished</b> by rotating only the basis vectors of the coordinate system. (The coordinate system {{can be thought of as}} being fixed in the rotated observer. The observer is physically rotated.) In this way, every point in space obtains new coordinates as if it was somehow physically rigidly rotated.|$|E
5|$|The IAPT's {{primary purpose}} is the {{promotion}} {{and understanding of}} biodiversity—the discovery, naming, classification, and systematics of plants—for both living and fossil plants. Additionally, it promotes the study and conservation of plant biodiversity, and works {{to raise awareness of}} the general public to this issue. The organization also facilitates international cooperation among botanists working in the fields of plant systematics, taxonomy, and nomenclature. This <b>is</b> <b>accomplished</b> in part through sponsorship of meetings and publication of resources, such as reference publications and journals.|$|E
5|$|The {{genetic code}} is {{the set of}} rules by which {{information}} encoded within genetic material (DNA or mRNA sequences) is translated into proteins by living cells. Translation <b>is</b> <b>accomplished</b> by the ribosome, which links amino acids in an order specified by mRNA, using transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules to carry amino acids and to read the mRNA three nucleotides at a time. The genetic code is highly similar among all organisms and can be expressed in a simple table with 64 entries.|$|E

5000|$|If {{we have a}} {{goal that}} is {{currently}} unsatisfied, {{it will be more}} prominent in our minds than a goal that has already <b>been</b> <b>accomplished.</b> Thus, if a protagonist has a goal that has not yet <b>been</b> <b>accomplished,</b> that goal should be more accessible to those who comprehend than a goal that <b>was</b> just <b>accomplished</b> by the protagonist. In line with this prediction, goals yet to <b>be</b> <b>accomplished</b> by the protagonist were recognized more quickly than goals that <b>were</b> just <b>accomplished.</b> We <b>are</b> often able to predict people’s future actions by inferring their goals. For example, when we see a man walking over to a chair, we assume that he wants to sit, especially when he has been standing for a long time. Thus, we might generate the inference, “He is going to sit." ...|$|R

5|$|The player gains {{points by}} {{defeating}} multiple enemies consecutively and {{can participate in}} a bonus round to gain more points. Enemies are defeated by kicking them over once they have been flipped on their back. This <b>is</b> <b>accomplished</b> by hitting the platform the enemy is on directly beneath them. If the player allows too much time to pass after doing this, the enemy will flip itself back over, changing in color and increasing speed. Each phase has {{a certain number of}} enemies, with the final enemy immediately changing color and increasing to maximum speed. Hitting a flipped enemy from underneath causes it to right itself and start moving again, but it does not change speed or color.|$|E
5|$|The user {{interface}} and game controls are unified across the PC and home console versions. Players {{have the option}} of using any combination of a keyboard, mouse, and game controller to play; the former two are achieved on PlayStation 4 via wireless or USB keyboard and mouse. By default, the system is navigated through drag and drop windows on PC. Navigation on the PlayStation version of Final Fantasy XIV <b>is</b> <b>accomplished</b> with a XrossMediaBar-like interface due to platform users' familiarity with the set-up. This bar is used to access all menus, maps, logs, and configuration options. The head-up display for both versions includes a message log, party status menu, mini-map, and action bar. The player may customize the location of all of these elements.|$|E
