[...] While Colbert accepted his apology, Stewart continued and asked why Colbert had initially responded by shoving a recycling bin over Stewart's head and hitting him with a baseball bat. [...] To which Colbert replied, [...] "No, no, Jon—I shoved a recycling bin over your head and encouraged Conan to <b>hit</b> <b>you</b> with a baseball bat," [...] and, as usual, left Stewart confused. [...] At the end of the segment, Stewart asked Colbert: [...] "Did we win that , by the way?" [...] Colbert's answer was, [...] "I think America won, Jon." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 1870, Wills captained Victoria to a 265-run {{win over}} New South Wales at the MCG. The match {{featured}} Twopenny (Jarrawuk), an Aboriginal paceman who {{was said to}} have been recruited by Lawrence as a foil to Wills' [...] "chucks". Comparing the two, the Melbourne press surmised: [...] "Undoubtedly Wills throws sometimes, but there is some decency about it, some disguise." [...] In March, Victoria trounced a Tasmanian XVI in Launceston under Wills' leadership, though not without criticism of his bowling action. The accusations of throwing were growing louder, and one-time ally Hammersley, now Melbourne's foremost sportswriter, emerged as Wills' most vocal critic. He accused Wills of resorting to throwing to maintain pace as he aged, and criticised him for introducing a type of bouncer designed to injure and intimidate batsmen. The Australasian, Hammersley's newspaper, described Wills' modus operandi: [...] "If I cannot hit your wicket or make you give a chance soon, I'll <b>hit</b> <b>you</b> and hurt you if I can. I'll frighten you out." ...|$|E
500|$|Cooder's displeasure {{with the}} Republican Party and its {{financial}} supporters, particularly the Koch Brothers, also inspired his songwriting. He found {{the party to}} be [...] "insanely dangerous" [...] to Barack Obama's presidency and the US, and said of them in an interview for The Guardian, [...] "in case anybody thinks Michele Bachmann or Sarah Palin are clowns because they misspeak or don't know their history or they say silly things: that's just an act, and it's a useful act. Everything is a distraction from the core truths which are, first of all, that corporations have taken over the country." [...] He viewed that his songs for the album provide a more convenient alternative for citizens who do not research politicians, saying that [...] "I don't write books and give speeches but with a four-minute song you can use allegory and other means to suggest {{a different point of}} view. It's like looking around the corner, and that's what songs are good at sometimes. They <b>hit</b> <b>you</b> with a new thought – assuming that people will listen." ...|$|E

500|$|Eventually, {{the review}} for Illmatic was {{handled by the}} magazine's {{columnist}} Miss Info (then writing under the nom de plume, [...] "shortie"), who shared Schecter's enthusiasm for Nas' album. In her review of Illmatic, Minyah wrote, [...] "I must maintain {{this is one of}} the best hip-hop albums I have ever heard" [...] and wrote of its content, [...] "Lyrically, the whole shit is on point. No cliched metaphors, no gimmicks. Never too abstract, never superficial." [...] She also commented on the impact of Nas's [...] "poetic realism" [...] writing: “Nas’ images remind me of the personal memories and people, both passed and present… All this may sound like melodrama but it not just me. I've been hearing similar responses all over. While 'Memory Lane' is my shit, my homies claim 'The World Is Yours,' and if you've got peoples doing time, then 'One Love' may <b>hit</b> <b>you</b> the hardest.". With the backing of Schecter and the other editors on the staff, Minya awarded Illmatic with the magazine's highest rating.|$|E
500|$|An authoritative, combative stylist, Macartney's élan {{and devastating}} strokemaking led Kent cricketer Kenneth Hutchings to dub him [...] "The Governor-General". Fingleton noted that, {{early in his}} innings, Macartney had a {{strategy}} of aiming a shot straight at the bowler's head, in order to rattle him and seize a psychological advantage. On one occasion, after reaching a century before lunch {{on the first day}} of a match, he immediately called for a bat change. He selected the heaviest bat from the batch that his team-mate brought out and stated [...] "Now I'm going to have a hit". His rate of scoring and boundary-hitting subsequently increased. He possessed powerful hands, strong forearms and broad shoulders. Leg spinning Test team-mate Arthur Mailey recalled that Macartney would often hit him for six in Sydney Grade Cricket matches. Grinning, he would say [...] "Pitch another one there and I'll <b>hit</b> <b>you</b> for a few more". On the occasions when he lost his wicket attempting further long hits, Macartney's grin remained, and he would remark [...] "Wasn't it good fun?"

[...] Gossard stated, [...] "We've {{made a couple of}} political and pointed records, the last two in particular, and just to move away from that is great, because it allows you {{to go back to that}} when you need to and it refreshes everybody, and it comes down to a beat and a melody and your friends and a lyric and a poem and something that's important to you." [...] Vedder stated he did not spend [...] "more than half hour" [...] writing the lyrics to each song: [...] "If it’s not gonna happen quick then I don’t wanna do it, because it means there’s another one out there that is gonna happen quick, and is gonna <b>hit</b> <b>you</b> like a lightning bolt." ...|$|E

Whatever moral lessons were {{presented}} in the earliest Saw films seem to have been dispensed with as the movies grow more and more gruesome, with filmmakers caught up in 'What would it look like if somebody's jaw was ripped out, or their skin was glued to a car seat?'

[...] Mike Hale of The New York Times called the film the most [...] "straightforward" [...] of the series and the [...] "most consistently (though not inventively) violent".

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} June 2013 at Filmistan, Mumbai. Hindustan Times {{reported that the}} set was ready at Filmistan studio, but following Chopra's father's death, the plans for shooting were put on hold. To make the boxing scenes authentic, some of the crew members, including Kumar himself, learnt boxing to get the necessary understanding of the sport to film the fight scenes. Initially, the makers had planned to use actors and teach them boxing to film the boxing scenes. They eventually realised {{that it would not}} be feasible and would be time-consuming. They also thought that if both Chopra and her opponents were not real boxers, it would not look convincing enough. Professional boxers were then employed to film the boxing sequences for giving a more natural feel and convincing look. Filming boxing scenes was difficult for Chopra as she got hurt several times; she says, [...] "They are real boxers and they don't know how to fake a punch, they had to really <b>hit</b> <b>you.</b> So I had to get hit a lot and that was really hard." [...] Robert Miller, the sports coordinator for films such as Bhaag Milkha Bhaag and Chak De! India (2007), was hired to choreograph the fight sequences.|$|E
500|$|Barr {{received}} some media exposure {{a few days}} after his nomination by visiting New York City to appear on both the Colbert Report and on Glenn Beck's Headline News program for an hour-long interview. The former appearance was part of the campaign's strategy to inform young voters and former Ron Paul supporters about the campaign. During the interview with Colbert, Barr was asked why he [...] "voted for the PATRIOT Act" [...] if he was such a [...] "big advocate of personal privacy." [...] He responded by saying that the Bush Administration [...] "went back on everything they told us [...] they would do with the PATRIOT Act." [...] In early June, the campaign dealt with the issue of racism when a white supremacist group posted a Barr endorsement on Stormfront.org, urging whites to vote for the [...] "best man" [...] rather than the [...] "liberal" [...] John McCain. The Barr campaign repudiated this endorsement. Campaign manager Russ Verney stated, [...] "We do not want and will not accept the support of haters. Tell the haters I said don't let the door <b>hit</b> <b>you</b> in the backside on the way out." [...] He emphasized that [...] "anyone with love in their heart for our country and for every resident of our country regardless of race, religion, nationality, or sexual orientation is welcome with open arms." ...|$|E

500|$|Seungsahn also {{developed}} his own kōan study program {{for students of}} the Kwan Um School, known today as the [...] "Twelve Gates". These twelve kōans are a mixture of ancient cases and cases which he developed. Before receiving inka to teach (in Kwan Um, inka is not synonymous with Dharma transmission), students must complete the Twelve Gates, though often they will complete hundreds more. One of the more well known cases of the Twelve Gates is [...] "Dropping Ashes on the Buddha", the Sixth Gate, {{which is also the}} title of one of his books. In the book The Compass of Zen, this kong-an is transcribed as follows: [...] "Somebody comes to the Zen center smoking a cigarette. He blows smoke and drops ashes on the Buddha." [...] Seungsahn then poses the question, [...] "If you are standing there at that time, what can you do?" [...] Not included in this version of the kōan is the Kwan Um School of Zen's following side note on the case, [...] "ere {{is an important factor in}} this case that has apparently never been explicitly included in its print versions.

500|$|In another {{interview}} with Soap Opera Digest, the actor spoke thoroughly of his departure, saying: [...] "It's {{not that one}} hadn't agreed to a reduction, but they <b>hit</b> <b>you</b> with a sledgehammer. It's done in such an insulting fashion. It could have been dealt with in a far more gracious way. It is cold and hard-nosed... The whole thing was so calculated it was unbelievable... It's not even about the money." [...] Despite this, during contract negotiations, Braeden refused {{to say that he}} had departed fully, but did not know when a return would occur. However, within weeks, news broke that the actor and the series had managed a new contract. In a statement issued by CBS Daytime, they said: [...] "We're very happy that Eric will be remaining with The Young and the Restless. Victor Newman has been {{an important part of the}} Genoa City canvas for nearly 30 years, and we know our audience will be tuning in to see what his plans are next." [...] Onscreen, Braeden exited November 2, 2009, and made his return on January 15, 2010. That same year, the actor celebrated thirty years on the soap opera. In 2012, Braeden experienced further contract negotiations and speculation arose again that he would be leaving. Published reports said that Victor would be absent from the canvas for two weeks and that his contract expired that November. Two months later, it was announced that the actor had signed a new contract with The Young and the Restless, furthering his portrayal of Victor for an unspecified period of time. Braeden stated that he was [...] "very glad we got the negotiations successfully behind us".|$|E

500|$|During the 1935 season Yorkshire {{regained the}} County Championship, and Verity passed 200wickets {{for the first}} time in his career, taking 211 at an average of 14.36 to finish third in the {{national}} averages. He took five wickets in an innings 22times and had 10 or more wickets in seven matches. South Africa played England in a five-Test series that year and won the series 1–0. Verity was selected in the first four games. In the first, his figures were three for 52 in 41overs on a pitch which assisted spin bowlers. England were in a position of dominance when rain ruined the game. Shortly afterwards, the tourists defeated Yorkshire; in the second innings, Jock Cameron hit 30runs from a single over bowled by Verity. Arthur Wood, the Yorkshire wicket-keeper, commented during the over: [...] "Go on, Hedley, you have him in two minds. He doesn't know whether to <b>hit</b> <b>you</b> for four or six!" [...] South Africa won the second Test match, their first Test win in England, although Verity took six wickets in the match. In the third game, Verity had bowling figures of two wickets for nine runs from 25overs in the match and in the fourth, he took one for 72 from 40overs. These two games were drawn, leaving England needing a victory in the final match. By now, Verity had acquired a reputation for being unable to take wickets on good batting pitches. In the report on the fourth Test, Wisden's correspondent observed: [...] "Verity again failed to worry South Africa's batsmen". With victory essential, Verity was dropped for the last match. He was replaced by off-spinner Johnnie Clay, regarded by critics as effective at flighting the ball.|$|E

Or maybe for a few seasons past." [...] Jed Gottlieb of the Boston Herald enjoyed the premise of the show but found that [...] "the music and message suffer in a setting where the audience is politely, soberly seated". Michael Kuchwara of the Associated Press found the show to be [...] "visually striking [...] musically adventurous", but noted that [...] "the show has the barest wisp of a story and minimal character development".
