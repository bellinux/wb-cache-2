5|$|By late May, {{the brigade}} {{was back at}} ANZAC Cove and in reserve. On 1 June, the Wellington Battalion moved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> lines, taking over Courtney's Post, {{previously}} held by the Australian 4th Brigade. Malone was post commander, and it was planned that he would stay in command at Courtney's Post while his battalion rotated with the Otago Infantry Battalion in eight-day spells. He immediately set about improving the position, which overlooked the Turkish lines. As well as rectifying the position's neglected field works, he established a squad of snipers and this proved instrumental in gaining ascendency over the Turks in no-man's land.|$|E

5|$|The 2nd Brigade's next {{parachute}} {{operation was}} Operation Hasty in June 1944. This {{was a small}} diversionary raid carried out by sixty men from the 6th Parachute Battalion. They were dropped into the area between Sora and Avezzano, their objective being to harass the Germans withdrawing to the Gothic Line. The mission was a success: a German brigade was diverted to hunt the small force, and a German division was retained on rear-area security duties instead of going <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line. In June 1944, the brigade {{was released from the}} Eighth Army and joined the 1st Airborne Task Force for airborne operations in the south of France.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Chinese {{plan called}} for the 58th Division to attack Hagaru-ri {{on the night of}} 27 November, but the division became lost in the countryside due to the outdated Japanese maps it used. It was not until the dawn of 28 November that the 58th Division arrived at Hagaru-ri. Meanwhile, from the fighting and ambushes that had occurred the previous night, the garrison at Hagaru-ri noticed the Chinese forces around them. Lieutenant Colonel Thomas L. Ridge, commander of 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines (3/1), predicted the Chinese attack would come on the night of 28 November. Almost everyone, including rear support units with little combat training, was pressed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line due to the manpower shortage, and the entire perimeter was on full alert by 21:30.|$|E

5|$|The {{regiment}} {{spent their}} time building winter quarters, and tunnelling into the hillside to provide protection against shellfire, doing so until 27 November {{when they moved}} back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line. On 9 December, Major Christopher Powles, the Brigade-Major, took over command of the regiment, with Studholme as the second in command. Three days later, the order for the complete evacuation of the peninsula was issued. Men with minor ailments left first, followed by one regiment or battalion from each brigade. The Auckland Mounted Rifles were chosen as the first regiment to leave from the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, which meant that the Canterbury Mounted Rifles had to extend its lines to cover for the Aucklanders. The last men were due to leave over the night of 19/20 December.|$|E
5|$|To {{strengthen}} the division's positions, the 1st Brigade was brought forward <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> lines overnight. The next day, an attack was {{launched by the}} brigade's 1st Wellington Battalion. Supported by artillery, which suppressed an attack made by the Germans minutes {{before the start of}} the battalion's advance from Flers Village, Grove Alley was captured. That evening the weather deteriorated and over the next few days rain filled trenches and shell holes, and turned the ground to thick mud. The New Zealanders were continually harassed by German artillery and localised attacks from the spur overlooking Grove Alley. Despite the conditions, the 1st Brigade carried out operations to {{strengthen the}} division's exposed left flank, but it remained vulnerable to enfilade fire from the German positions.|$|E
5|$|A set {{procedure}} {{was used by}} a division that was moving <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line. Once they had been informed that they were moving forward, the brigadiers and battalion commanders would {{be taken to the}} forward areas to reconnoitre the sections of the front that were to be occupied by their troops. Meanwhile, the battalion transport officers would be taken to the headquarters of the division that they were relieving to observe the methods used for drawing rations and ammunition, {{and the manner in which}} they were supplied to the troops at the front. Detachments from the divisional artillery group would move forward and were attached to the artillery batteries of the division they were relieving. Five days later, the infantry battalions that were destined for the front line sent forward their specialists from the Lewis gun teams, and the grenade officer, the machine gun officer, the four company commanders, and some of the signallers to take over the trench stores and settle into the trench routine before the battalions moved in. Overnight, the battalions would move into the line, and the artillery would take over the guns that were already in position, leaving theirs behind to be taken over by the batteries that had been relieved.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1915, {{after several}} {{occasions}} when the British had to temporarily dismount regiments and send them <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> lines, an establishment for the Dismounted Cavalry Division was created. The three British cavalry divisions each formed a dismounted cavalry brigade, with the 1st Brigade being raised from the 1st Division, and so on. The cavalry brigades formed a dismounted cavalry battalion, numbered after their parent brigades, so the 9th Cavalry Brigade formed the 9th Dismounted Battalion, for example. The cavalry regiments each formed one dismounted company and a machine gun section for their battalion. However, the Dismounted Cavalry Division, with only three brigades, was smaller than an infantry division, which had four brigades. This disadvantage was felt throughout the formation, with the dismounted cavalry brigade only having three battalions instead of the four in an infantry formation, and the dismounted cavalry battalion only having three, albeit larger, companies {{as opposed to the}} four of an infantry battalion. There was one other divisional-sized formation raised in 1916 that contained British cavalry regiments. This was the Imperial Cavalry Division, which served in the campaign in Mesopotamia. This was another British Indian Army division, and like all Indian divisions, it had one British regiment per brigade.|$|E
5|$|Much more {{is known}} of the {{hundreds}} of unique cleitean that decorate the archipelago. These dome-shaped structures are constructed of flat boulders with a cap of turf on the top. This enables the wind to pass through the cavities in the wall but keeps the rain out. They were used for storing peat, nets, grain, preserved flesh and eggs, manure, and hay, and as a shelter for lambs in winter. The date of origin of this St Kildan invention is unknown, but they were in continuous use from prehistoric times until the 1930 evacuation. More than 1,200 ruined or intact cleitean remain on Hirta and a further 170 on the neighbouring islands. House no. 16 in the modern village has an early Christian stone cross built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> wall, which may date from the 7th century.|$|E
5|$|Once the {{infantry}} {{had reached the}} German trenches, the artillery shifted from the creeping barrage to the standing barrage, a static barrage that would protect {{the infantry}} from counter-attack while they consolidated the position. A variant was the box barrage, in which three or four barrages formed a box—or more often three sides of a box—around a position to isolate and prevent reinforcements being brought up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line. This was normally used to protect trench raids, although {{it could also be}} used offensively against a German unit. Another type of barrage was the SOS barrage, fired in response to a German counterattack. An SOS barrage could be brought down by firing a flare signal of a pre arranged colour, as a German barrage tended to cut the telephone lines. A pre-registered barrage would then descend on No Man's Land.|$|E

5|$|The 2nd New Zealand Division {{had moved}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line in November {{in order to}} relieve the 8th Indian Division and would {{take part in the}} advance across the Sangro planned {{for the end of the}} month. The brigade {{subsequently}} occupied positions around Atessa, with the Māori Battalion in brigade reserve, occupying a series of low hills which formed the Sangro river valley. The Eighth Army's forward units had reached the Sangro in early November and General Harold Alexander—commander of the 15th Army Group—had planned for Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery to strike across the river on its coastal plain on 20 November with V Corps. Montgomery shifted the 8th Indian Division to the right in secret to narrow the V Corps front and concentrate its power, bringing the newly arrived 2nd New Zealand Division into the gap. Heavy rain flooded the river, forcing the postponement of the offensive and giving the Germans time to move in reinforcements. In the early hours of 28 November the Eighth Army attack began, supported by heavy artillery concentrations. The New Zealanders advanced steadily, capturing the bulk of their objectives. The Māori Battalion, still in brigade reserve, stood to during the attack but was not required.|$|E
5|$|The {{entry of}} the United States into World War I excited Baker, as it finally {{gave him a}} purpose in life and allowed him to {{make good use of}} his pilot training. He left the United States for Europe in the summer of 1917, among the first group of Americans to do so. Though eager to join the front immediately, Baker was told that he had to be {{certified}} by the French. Success in the courses was dependent on how quickly the pilots learned French, the predominant language of instruction. Though he managed to complete all the courses easily, a lack of qualified teachers meant that Baker was first sent to a school in England for more training and then back to France to teach Americans what he had learned in England, in an attempt to create pilots as quickly as possible. This discouraged Baker, who was eager to get <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> lines and fight. Owing to a lack of aircraft supplies, Baker was stuck in Paris, and doubted he would ever get to the front. While in Paris, he was happy to continue seeing Scott, who had enlisted as a nurse and worked at a hospital in France.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} the {{regiment}} returned to their previous task of flank protection. At midday the 3rd and 11th Squadrons were located along the ridge south-east of El Buggar, forcing the Turkish observation posts to retire. The day was almost {{a replica of the}} previous one and the regiment was back at Shellal at 21:30. Instead of resting overnight, they moved to El Mendur, arriving there at 06:00 on 19 April. The division was now required to be more aggressive, to draw the Turkish forces towards them, {{because of the lack of}} progress by the force attacking Gaza. The 3rd Squadron was detailed as a guard force for the division's artillery, accompanying them to Atawineh. The squadron moved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line, losing one dead and seventeen wounded by the time it withdrew at 20:00. The rest of the regiment was held in reserve, having two men wounded during an aircraft attack. By the end of the day, the second attempt to take Gaza was called off, the defences being to strong for a frontal assault.|$|E

5|$|The spacewalk {{scene on}} the Enterprise {{exterior}} {{was one of the}} most challenging sets to envision and construct for the film. The production had to design a space suit that looked practical rather than exaggerated. Fans were built into the helmets so that the actors would not get overheated, and neon lights built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> so that the occupant's faces could be seen. When the actors first put the helmets on, the fully enclosed design made it hard to breathe; after a minute of wearing the suit Stewart became ill, and shooting was discontinued. The set for the ship's outer hull and deflector dish were built on gimbals at Paramount's largest sound stage, surrounded by bluescreen and rigged with wires for the zero gravity sequences. The stage was not large enough to accommodate a full-sized replica of the Enterprise dish, so Zimmerman had to scale down the plans by 15percent.|$|E
5|$|With the {{withdrawal}} of the infantry divisions, the only Indian Army units on the Western Front were the two cavalry divisions. In November 1916, the two Indian cavalry divisions were renumbered from 1st and 2nd to the 4th and 5th Cavalry Divisions. Serving alongside British cavalry divisions they were held behind the front line awaiting the hoped for breakthrough. At times during the war they served in the trenches as infantry, each cavalry brigade when dismounted formed a dismounted regiment. This meant that when the divisions went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line, they could only cover a brigade area. Before being themselves withdrawn to Egypt in March 1918, they took part in the Battle of the Somme, the Battle of Bazentin, the Battle of Flers-Courcelette, the advance to the Hindenburg Line and finally the Battle of Cambrai.|$|E
5|$|After {{the second}} battle for Gaza in April 1917, Kress von Kressensteincommander of the victorious 3rd, 16th and 53rd Divisionswas {{reinforced}} by the 7th and 54th Divisions. The 7th Infantry Division (later part of the Eighth Army) had experienced four months of strategic movement, {{similar to that of}} the 54th Division. Having arrived at Jerusalem, in early May the 20th Infantry Regiment began company-level training. After moving to Beersheba where they remained in reserve, they participated in theatre-specific training until late June, when they went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> line. Training in fortification, reconnaissance, and counter–reconnaissance continued. The 21st Infantry Regiment received similar training, and on 6 August the regimental colours of the 20th and 21st Infantry Regiments were awarded military medals for service in the Gallipoli Campaign. At Beersheba on 28 June, the 7th Infantry Division inactivated the fourth company of each infantry battalion, before activating a machine gun company armed with light machine guns, in every infantry battalion on 10 August. Every Ottoman infantry division in Palestine repeated this reorganisation, with one quarter of their rifle strength being replaced by light machine guns, considerably increasing their fire power and strengthening their offensive and defensive capabilities. Following orders from von Kressenstein commanding the Gaza to Beersheba line defences, assault detachments equivalent to the German Stosstruppen (Stormtroopers) were formed. The 7th Division activated an assault detachment of fifty men on 17 July 1917.|$|E
