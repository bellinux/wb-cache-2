25|$|Wharton {{professor}} Simon Kuznets, {{who later}} won the Nobel Prize in Economics, created statistical data on national output, prices, investment, and capital stock, and also measured seasonability, cycles, and secular trends of these phenomena. His work laid out {{what became the}} standard procedure for measuring {{the gross national product}} and the gross domestic product, and he later led an international effort to establish the same statistical information for all national economies. Professor Lawrence Klein, who also won the Nobel Prize in Economics, developed the first <b>econometric</b> <b>model</b> of the U.S. economy, which combined economic theory with mathematics, providing another way to test theories and predict future economic trends.|$|E
2500|$|James Tobin (March 5, 1918 – March 11, 2002) was an American {{economist}} {{who served on}} the Council of Economic Advisers and the [...] Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and taught at Harvard and Yale Universities. He developed the ideas of Keynesian economics, and advocated government intervention to stabilize output and avoid recessions. [...] His academic work included pioneering contributions to the study of investment, monetary and fiscal policy and financial markets. He also proposed an <b>econometric</b> <b>model</b> for censored endogenous variables, the well-known [...] "Tobit model". Tobin received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1981.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) National Research Council (NRC) {{conducted}} {{a review of}} current research and data on firearms and violent crime, including Lott's work, and found [...] "no credible evidence that the passage of right-to-carry laws decreases or increases violent crime." [...] James Q. Wilson dissented from that opinion, and while accepting the committee's findings on violent crime in general, {{he noted that the}} committee's own findings in several tests showed [...] "that shall-issue laws drive down the murder rate". The NRC committee took no position on the correctness of the competing Ayres-Donohue hybrid model other than to note it nested the Lott-Mustard separate first year level and future trend models into a single <b>econometric</b> <b>model</b> simultaneously handling level and trend; when the committee applied the hybrid model to a hypothetical county dataset showing a declining crime rate, the hybrid model produced a spike in crime level followed by an accelerated downward trend (Figure 6-1, page 135).|$|E

40|$|Sales {{forecasting}} at the UPC {{level is}} important for the retailers in inventory planning. In practice, many retailers produce the forecasts using simple models with subjective adjustment for promotional events. The <b>econometric</b> <b>models,</b> which could be an effective way of incorporating promotional information, are not widely applied. This research examines the performance of the <b>econometric</b> <b>models</b> in forecasting the product sales at the UPC level, asking whether this lack of application arises from poor performance compared to simple benchmarks. Standard models assume constant structure which may subsequently expose the models to structural breaks and then forecast failure. To tackle the problem, we modify the <b>econometric</b> <b>models</b> with three approaches: impulse saturation, intercept correction and estimation window combining. Categories are considered as a basis for generalising the empirical results. 29 categories were segmented using conceptual mapping technique and experiments were conducted for those which are distinguishable and representative. The results show that the <b>econometric</b> <b>models</b> outperform the benchmark (simple) models for most of the categories and their forecasting performance can be further improved by the modification approaches, especially for the non-promoted forecast period. The explanation may lie {{in the fact that the}} <b>econometric</b> <b>models</b> take concerns of the competitive promotional information. However, for one distinct category- the “Front-end-candies”, the benchmark models proved superior. For the promoted period, the unmodified <b>econometric</b> <b>models</b> generally yield the best performance. One implication of our research is to use the unmodified <b>econometric</b> <b>models</b> and the modified <b>econometric</b> <b>models</b> to forecast the promoted period and the non-promoted period separately...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of <b>econometric</b> <b>models</b> to short-term forecasting, {{that is to}} say, forecasting up to one year ahead, has naturally enough been extensively discussed. Some of the discussion has centred on the usefulness of <b>econometric</b> <b>models</b> in general for this purpose as against other forecasting methods. It is clearly realised that short-term forecasting by means of non-econometric methods is not only possible but may give better results than are obtained {{by the use of}} <b>econometric</b> <b>models.</b> It is therefore quite legitimate to argue against the use of models in the realm of short-term forecasting.

This paper reports a comparison of various <b>econometric</b> <b>models</b> and estimated WTP values with reference to {{a case study of}} rural feeder service to bus stop. <b>Econometric</b> <b>models</b> included Multinomial Logit (MNL), Heteroskedastic Extreme Value (HEV), Nested Logit (NL), Covariance Heterogeneity Nested Logit (CHNL), and Random Parameter Logit (RPL). Various <b>econometric</b> <b>models</b> are found to be consistent and acceptable in terms of signs of coefficient estimates, statistical significance of coefficient estimates and overall goodness of fit. The WTP values are found to vary across different model specifications, although the variations are not consistent and predominant for all attributes. In the present case study, the effect of model specification is found predominant on WTP for a reduction in access walking distance. Also, RPL models accounting for deterministic heterogeneity are found superior to other <b>econometric</b> <b>models</b> such as MNL, HEV, NL, CHNL and RPL models accounting for only random heterogeneity.
