Three separate genera now accommodate former members of the genus: the small-bodied newts (Lissotriton), the banded newts (Ommatotriton), and the alpine newt (Ichthyosaura). The monophyly of the genus Triturus in the strict sense is supported by molecular data and synapomorphies such as a genetic defect causing 50% embryo mortality (see below, <b>Egg</b> <b>deposition</b> and development).|$|E

40|$|Factors {{affecting}} the fitness of juvenile salmon are discussed. Although fitness from the genetic {{point of view}} is defined as the relative capacity of carriers of a given genotype to transmit their genes to the gene pool of the following generations, growth and survival of individuals are also components of fitness, and are influenced by responses to competition, which is the major topic of this article including implications for management.

25|$|When a {{parasitic}} female lays her egg {{in a host}} female’s nest, {{the host}} female experiences a deposition rate of two eggs per day. Host females may recognize parasitic eggs when the <b>egg</b> <b>deposition</b> pattern deviates from the traditional one egg per day pattern. The occurrence of brood parasitism {{may be influenced by}} the body size of the potential parasitic female relative to the potential host female. Parasitic females are generally larger than their host counterparts, but on average, there is no size difference between the parasite and the host.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the female}} is {{carrying}} a fertilised egg within her pelvic fins, she then seeks an <b>egg</b> <b>deposition</b> site. The choice of such a site is frequently, though not always, a mass of fine leaved aquatic vegetation. In the aquarium, the plant known as Java moss, Vesicularia dubayana, is of considerable utility as an egg repository for Corydoras catfishes, even though the plant is not a South American native, and panda catfish females will choose large clumps of this plant readily as safe deposition sites for fertilised eggs. The female is frequently pursued {{by one or more}} males as she seeks the deposition site, each male presumably seeking to be the chosen mate to fertilise the next egg. Up to 25 eggs may be produced by a single female during a single spawning, which may take place over four to five hours.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} behaviors of species of Parischnogaster is the <b>egg</b> <b>deposition</b> process. The ovipositing female uses an abdominal substance produced by herself to handle the egg. In the first stage, the wasp collects a patch of viscid abdominal substance in her mouth. The patch is then placed into the cell. In the second stage, the wasp bends her abdomen towards her mouth. As the egg emerges from the abdomen the female will grasp it with its mouthparts. The final stage consists of collecting another patch of abdominal substance to place on top of the egg in the cell. This process may have evolved for defense purposes. Since P. alternata typically take on flight as an active defense, this method helps the female save the egg they are laying if disturbed by an attack.|$|E
40|$|Parents have {{to assess}} the multivariate {{characteristics}} of their reproductive sites to maximize their reproductive success through offspring performance. In addition, they may provide care to ensure optimal performance of their offspring. In poison frogs it has been identified that ecological characteristics of reproductive sites may underlie transitions in the involvement of parental sexes in care for offspring. To elucidate the ecological factors that may drive these transitions, {{it is important to}} understand which characteristics poison frogs use {{to assess the}} quality of their reproductive site. We studied the use of small water bodies in leaf axils of bromeliads, phytotelmata, for <b>egg</b> and tadpole <b>deposition</b> by Amazon poison frogs (Ranitomeya amazonica). We compared phytotelm quality characteristics for preferred <b>egg</b> and tadpole <b>deposition</b> sites and used two choice tests with plastic cups to study the causal relationship with tadpole deposition for the identified characteristics. The differences among quality characteristics of deposition sites were largest among bromeliad species, and for <b>egg</b> or tadpole <b>deposition</b> different bromeliad species were preferred. However, males were also selective in the leaf axils within a bromeliad species that they used for <b>egg</b> or tadpole <b>deposition.</b> <b>Eggs</b> were deposited in small, resource limited water bodies that were close to the forest floor. Tadpoles were deposited in leaf axils holding resource-rich phytotelmata with larger water volumes. Preference of detritus containing water over clear water in choice tests confirmed that Amazon poison frogs assess quality of their tadpole deposition sites on food availability. We conclude that preference for large water volume and resource rich phytotelmata plays an important role in determining male involvement in parental care and speculate that distribution of preferred resources may bring about selection on female involvement in parental care...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we present a {{non-lethal}} multi-biomarker methodological approach developed and applied to study the ecotoxicological status of the Mediterranean population of loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta, Linneo, 1758). In the last 8 years more than 120 specimens of C. caretta were sampled for blood, skin biopsies and carapax sub-samples in several Italian rescue centers and during a survey in Spain. Blood lymphocytes and skin biopsy slices treated with different contaminants (OCs, PAHs and PBDEs) showed induction of cytochrome P 450 1 A (WB) and this biomarker of exposure to liposoluble contaminants was subsequently applied to C. caretta sampled in the different areas. Oxidative stress responses were evaluated on plasma samples by developing a plasma lipid peroxidation (LPO) test which showed a correlation to CYP 1 A. Potential genotoxic effects were investigated by developing comet assay and ENA (erythrocytic nuclear abnormalities) test in whole blood samples. Biomarkers of hepatic stress such as ALT AST and γ- GT were measured in plasma.

40|$|It is {{generally}} {{believed that the}} diapausing egg of the silkworm contains a substance which is transmitted from the mother and has an inhibitory action upon the develop-ment of the embryo.

It is not unreasonable to suppose that the 'inhibitory substance', which reveals its action in the <b>egg</b> after <b>deposition,</b> has some connexion with the diapause factor (hormone) secreted by the suboesophageal ganglion of the mother (Hasegawa, 1951, 1952; Fukuda, 1951), but nothing {{is known about the}} real nature and action of the diapause factor (Fukuda, 1955). On the other hand, Umeya (1937 a, b, 1938, 1939, 1952) insists that in the diapausing egg, although the embryo is always ready to grow, some unfavourable condition of the yolk surrounding the embryo inhibits its development beyond a certain stage during diapause, while Miura (1932 a, b, 1938) claims that not only the yolk, but also the embryo itself remains inactive in the diapausing egg.

40|$|A {{maternal}} effect {{occurs when the}} phenotype of an organism {{is influenced by the}} phenotype of its mother. When the maternal environment is an accurate predictor of the offspring's environment, {{maternal effect}}s can {{play an important role in}} enhancing offspring fitness. Maternal investment (e. g. egg size), which is often a function of maternal size, is one mechanism for the transmission of maternal effects. I used the mud snail, Ilyanassa obsoleta, as a model system for examining the effects of maternal size on offspring phenotypes. Females deposit egg capsules on blades of eel grass, and exhibit high variability in the number of egg capsules laid, the number of eggs per capsule, and the morphology of their egg capsules. During early ontogeny, encapsulated embryos suffer high levels of predation. I conducted two studies to test for the presence of inducible maternal effects in response to predation. First, I conducted a pilot study analyzing how maternal size affects <b>egg</b> capsule <b>deposition</b> in small (shell length = 14. 5 - 18. 0 mm) medium (18. 1 - 21. 0 mm) and large (21. 1 - 26. 0 mm) snails, both with and without the presence of a predator (the green crab, Carcinus maenas). In this experiment I measured egg size, the number of eggs per capsule, the number of egg capsules laid, and several egg capsule morphometrics. I then, in a more complete study, investigated how <b>egg</b> capsule <b>deposition</b> and embryonic development are influenced by maternal size in the presence of predatory green crabs by exposing small (15 – 19 mm) and large (21 – 25 mm) adult mud snails to C. maenas cue and measuring egg size, egg number, egg capsule number, and egg capsule morphometrics. Additionally, I measured larvae at hatching to test for effects of predator cues on intracapsular development. Across both studies, I found that large snails lay more egg capsules and eggs per capsule, and that large snails lay significantly larger eggs than small snails. Larval size at hatching increased significantly in the presence of green crabs, and there is a trend suggesting that these larvae hatch sooner. Egg capsules were longer and wider in large snails, and, in the presence of a predator, were wider and possessed significantly longer defensive spines. In a test of predator preference, capsules with short spines were preferentially preyed upon by hermit crabs, suggesting that spines may be an adaptive deterrent to predation on egg capsules. Altogether, these results suggest that maternal effects in I. obsoleta can be size- and context-dependent, play an important role in defending embryos from predators during early development, and may persist post-hatching...|$|R
40|$|A nursery {{site for}} the Alaska skate (Bathyraja parmifera) was sampled {{seasonally}} from June 2004 to July 2005. At the small nursery site (2 km 2), located in a highly productive area near the shelf-slope interface {{at the head of}} Bering Canyon in the eastern Bering Sea, reproductive males and females dominated the catch and neonate and juvenile skates were rare. Seasonal samples showed summertime (June and July) as the peak reproductive time in the nursery although some reproduction occurred throughout the year.

Estimated <b>egg</b> case <b>deposition</b> occurred mainly during summertime and hatching occurred during winter months. Protracted hatching times may be common for oviparous elasmobranch species and may be directly correlated with ambient temperatures as evident from a meta-data analysis.

40|$|Mazatlania fulgurata {{inhabit the}} lower {{intertidal}} of Playa Avellana, a dissipative beach in Costa Rica. They were first described in 1971 when live specimens were observed with eggs {{attached to their}} shell, however their reproductive biology and ecology has never been studied. Northwest Costa Rica {{is characterized by a}} rainy and dry season, which correlates with M. fulgurata <b>egg</b> case <b>deposition.</b> Snails are found with egg cases attached to their shells predominantly during the dry season (November to April) and this percentage significantly decreases with the rainy season (May-October). Therefore the breeding season is clearly defined by seasonal fluctuations whereby there is an equal breeding and non-breading period during their reproductive cycle. It is suggested that osmotic pressure plays a role in the egg case production. Futhermore, egg cases were not found on all M. fulgurata specimens so in order to determine if size played any role in <b>egg</b> case <b>deposition</b> snails were collected and measured. A lower percentage of snails carry egg cases and those that do carry egg cases, are on average, larger in size compared to animals without egg cases attached to their shell. This questions whether M. fulgurata are hermaphrodites or if separate sexes exist along with whether egg cases are deposited on one 2 ̆ 7 s own shell or on the shells of other individuals within the population. The number of egg cases found on the shell of individuals varied from as few as one to as many as forty-one, however on average the number of eggs/larvae per egg case was twenty-six. Regardless of the number of egg cases that a snail has attached to its shell, the eggs are exclusively found on the apertural side, within grooves and always laid starting at the aperture, extending towards the apex. These observations concerning the pattern of <b>egg</b> case <b>deposition</b> directly questions the statement made by Penchaszadeh et al. (1986) regarding the reproductive strategy of M. aciculata, which states that eggs are laid on the shell of other females in the population of more than 9 mm in length. Mazatlania fulgurata deposit egg cases within grooves, presumably providing mechanical protection of the encapsulated embryos. Alternatively, Vermeij and Hora have proposed hypotheses that suggest depositing egg cases on the shell surface creates `roughness 2 ̆ 7 which may confer an adaptive advantage to the fierce wave action characteristic of the intertidal; specifically by creating turbulence, reducing drag and creating a calm water effect in the animal 2 ̆ 7 s vicinity. Experimentation to test these hypotheses revealed that the presence of egg cases has exactly the opposite effect, egg cases increase drag and consequently, snails with attached egg cases fall through the water column at a slower velocity that is significantly different from snails without attached egg case. In addition to the experiment, the Re value was calculated which revealed that shell roughness would have no effect on drag reduction based on the `drag crisis 2 ̆ 7 mechanism. Therefore the presence of egg cases is associated with an increased hydrodynamic resistance and the significant effect that egg cases have on falling velocity remains to be explained. The systematic positioning of egg cases in grooves on the shell surface is presumed {{to play a role in}} parental protection. The encapsulated embryos are protected from the stresses associated with the intertidal and upon development within the structures they are subsequently released into the interstitial where they live between sand grains until they metamorphosis into juveniles. Among all beaches, the predator-prey relationship plays a role in the continued existence of a species. Specifically among Playa Avellana Agaronia propatula is a key predator however, in the rocky fringe area where Mazatlania fulgurata aggregate A. propatula are rarely found. To determine if predation pressure could explain this phenomenon, the scent of M. fulgurata and a live specimen were presented to actively hunting Agaronia. Agaronia propatula do in fact accept M. fulgurataas prey and are even able to recognize them through olfactory stimulus; therefore the distribution of the two species on Playa Avellana may be a direct consequence of predation pressure. ...|$|R
