Regional peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> and time to peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> were determined in eight ventricular segments before and after nicardipine. At baseline, the time from the R wave to the regional peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> was 380 - 680 msec, {{and there were a}} large number of segments with depressed peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> (p less than 0. 001, vs. distribution of regional peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> in normal subjects using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), indicating both asynchrony of filling (p less than 0. 001, vs. distribution of time to peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> in normal subjects) and nonhomogeneity of diastolic distensibility. Nicardipine administration significantly reduced the distribution of the time to peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> (p less than 0. 001) and increased regional peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> (p less than 0. 001) in a large subset of segments.

40|$|AbstractThe noninvasive {{measurement}} of left ventricular filling has relied predominantly on radionuclide-derived peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> normalized to end-diastolic volume. Doppler echocardiography {{also has the}} ability to measure peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate,</b> but wide application of this technique has been limited by technical errors involved in quantitative echocardiographic determination of mitral anulus cross-sectional area and ventricular volumes. For Doppler echocardiography, normalization of peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> to mitral stroke volume rather than end-diastolic volume permits the derivation of a diastolic filling index that is relatively free of errors caused by geometric assumptions, diameter measurements and sample volume positioning. This normalization process can be achieved by simply dividing early peak filling velocity by the time velocity integral of mitral inflov. To validate this new Doppler echocardiographic filling index, Doppler echocardiographic and radionuclide-derived peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate,</b> both normalized to mitral stroke volume, were compared in 30 patients; there was an excellent correlation (r = 0. 91, SEE = 0. 88). This variable was not influenced by the position of the sample volume in relation to the mitral apparatus in contrast to early filling velocity, which increased 37 %, and early/late filling (E/A) ratio, which increased 43 % as the sample volume was moved from the anulus to the tips of the mitral leaflets. In a cohort of 22 normal patients, the mean peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> normalized to mitral stroke volume (SV) was 5. 25 ± 1. 47 SV/s. The mean peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> for a subgroup of eight normal patients aged 57 to 89 years (mean 71 ± 9) was 3. 9 ± 1 SV/s. In conclusion, normalization of peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> to mitral stroke volume minimizes technical errors involved in measuring Doppler echocardiographic peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> in the same fashion that normalization to end-diastolic volume minimizes technical errors involved in radionuclide angiographic {{measurement of}} peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate.</b> For this reason, peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> normalized to mitral stroke volume may provide a more reliable and reproducible method for assessing left ventricular filling.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to ascertain whether the reversal of low peak <b>filling</b> <b>rates</b> after administration of calcium channel blockers in patients with diastolic dysfunction indicates true improvement in the rate of ventricular relaxation and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure measured by invasive indexes. Background. Depressed <b>filling</b> <b>rates</b> measured noninvasively have been associated with diastolic dysfunction, specifically abnormal relaxation of the left ventricle. There is a reversal of these low peak <b>filling</b> <b>rates</b> after administration of calcium channel blockers. Methods. Doppler echocardiographic measurements of peak <b>filling</b> <b>rates</b> were made and invasive high fidelity manometer-tipped pressures were measured before and after administration of verapamil (0. 1 mg/kg body weight) in 20 patients with coronary artery disease who had an ejection fraction > 40 % and decreased peak <b>filling</b> <b>rates.</b> Results. Verapamil caused significant increases in the peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate,</b> as measured by early transmitral (E) flow velocity, from 0. 57 ± 0. 16 m/s to 0. 77 ± 0. 15 m/s (p < 0. 01), indicating reversal of decreased peak <b>filling</b> <b>rates.</b> Concomitantly, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased from 18. 0 ± 7. 7 mm Hg to 24. 1 ± 9. 0 mm Hg (p < 0. 001). The time constant of relaxation was variable, with an overall significant increase from 45. 8 ± 10. 4 ms to 53. 2 ± 14. 6 ms (p = 0. 01). Conclusions. Verapamil administered intravenously produced reversal of decreased peak <b>filling</b> <b>rates</b> in patients with coronary artery disease and normal ventricular function. However, there was an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure as well as an overall prolongation of the time constant of relaxation. Therefore, changes in peak <b>filling</b> <b>rates</b> do not accurately reflect the response of ventricular relaxation to drug interactions. Thus, calcium channel blockers should be used cautiously in the empiric treatment of patients with diastolic dysfunction...|$|R

40|$|Left {{ventricular}} diastolic filling {{has been}} reported to be impaired in many patients with coronary artery disease. To study the relation between global and regional filling of LV, resting ECG-gated pool study was performed in 22 normal subjects and 24 patients with angina pectoris with isolated stenosis (＞ 75 %) of proximal LAD but without myocardial infarction. A computer program subdivided LV into four regions and the time-activity curves and the first derivative curves were computed in global LV and in each region (septal, apical and lateral region). End-systole of each region occurred very close to global end-systole in both groups. In global LV, peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> was decreased (p＜. 001) and the time to peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate,</b> measured from global end-systole to peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate,</b> was prolonged (p＜. 001) in patients with angina pectoris than in normal subjects. In the septal and apical sides perfused by stenosed vessel, peak <b>filling</b> <b>rates</b> were slightly decreased in apical region (p＜. 02), but not in septal region (p=NS), and time to peak <b>filling</b> <b>rates</b> were prolonged in apical (p＜. 001) and in septal region (p＜. 001) in patients with angina pectoris compared with normal subjects. In the normally perfused lateral side, there were no differences in peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> and in time to peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> between both groups.

A negative correlation existed between total | dt | and global peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> (r=- 0. 64, p＜. 001).

Ultrafast computed tomography was used to characterize global and regional early diastolic filling in the left ventricle of 11 normal male volunteers. Regional early diastolic filling data from six distinct ventricular levels (apex to base) were fit to a third-order polynomial curve, and the peak <b>rate</b> of diastolic <b>filling</b> and time of peak filling were determined. Peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> was 259 ± 17 ml/s (±SEM) as a global average, where peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> referenced to end-diastolic volume and stroke volume across the levels examined was 3. 78 ± 0. 17 s−and 4. 83 ± 0. 20 s−respectively. Average filling fraction was 39 ± I%, and time to peak filling from end-systole was 145 ± 5 ms. Regional (tomographic) peak <b>filling</b> <b>rates,</b> except for the most apical level examined, were not statistically different across the ventricle. Filling fraction and time to peak filling were remarkably constant from one level to another. However, reference of regional peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> to regional end-diastolic volume demonstrated significant nonuniformity from apex (120 % of average for all levels) to base (87 % of average for all levels). Peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> referenced to tomographic stroke volume was less variable and not statistically different across the ventricle as a whole. In conclusion, values of regional absolute early peak diastolic ventricular <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> or values normalized for regional end-diastolic volume are characteristically nonuniform across the left ventricle, whereas other variables such as filling fraction, time to peak filling and regional peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> referenced to regional stroke volume are highly uniform.

The isovolumic relaxation period was determined automatically on left ventricular time-activity curves as the interval between minimal volume and onset of rapid filling. In 17 patients, M-mode echocardiography performed simultaneously with radionuclide angiography demonstrated that onset of mitral valve opening correlated well with onset of rapid filling (r = 0. 84, p < 0. 001). The isovolumic relaxation period was longer in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy than in cdntrol subjects (95 ± 44 versus 50 ± 23 ms, p < 0. 01) and was longer in patients without an outflow tract gradient at rest than in patients with a gradient (109 ± 37 versus 86 ± 35 ms, p < 0. 05). In these patients without obstruction, a weak linear relation between duration of the isovolumic period and peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> was fodnd (r = 0. 48, p < 0. 02). Filling was impaired in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, as assessed by lower peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> (3. 2 ± 1. 2 versus 3. 5 ± 0. 5 end-diastolic volume/s, p < 0. 05) and prolonged time to peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> (185 ± 44 versus 145 ± 20 ms, p < 0. 01) compared with values in control subjects. The delay in time to peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> was caused primarily by the prolonged isovolumic period, because the interval from onset of rapid filling to peak <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> was similar in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and control subjects (87 ± 31 versus 95 ± 25 ms, NS). Studies were repeated in 43 patients after administration of oral verapamil (320 to 640 mg/day).

It is, therefore, concluded that indirect selection for grain yield via growth <b>rate,</b> grain <b>filling</b> <b>rate</b> per unit area and harvest index is efficient. Results suggest that use of easily measured physiological traits in sorghum breeding is possible...|$|R
