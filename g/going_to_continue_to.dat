25|$|The {{independent}} wrestlers {{were well}} {{received by the}} Arena Coliseo crowd, cheering especially for the portions of the match where Blue Panther and Negro Navarro wrestled against each other. The match ended when Averno forced Black Terry to submit and Blue Panther forced Villano IV to submit to win the third fall. Afterwards the fans showed their appreciation of the match by throwing money into the ring, causing both Panther and Navarro to actually go into the seats to collect more money after the match. Both Panther and Navarro teased that they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> fight, which drew a favorable response from the crowd. Before the fifth match of the night Ray Mendoza, Jr. took the microphone and announced to the crowd that this would actually be his last match as a professional wrestler. Rayo de Jalisco and his team won both {{the second and third}} fall to win the entire match. In the main event the challenger La Sombra and the champion Dragón Rojo, Jr. quickly split the first two falls between them, tied up at 1–1. The third fall was longer than both the previous falls combined and finally saw Dragón Rojo, Jr. successfully defend the championship when he forced La Sombra to submit.|$|E

Paul Cattermole once commented that the speed of the schedule sometimes caused a [...] "kind of dreamscape in your head", as the group often felt [...] "jetlagged and tired". On top of the filming schedules, the group often performed at high-profile pop music festivals such as Party in the Park where they performed for 100,000 fans.

500|$|Although most stories {{submitted}} to Super Science Stories were rejects from the better-paying markets such as Astounding Science Fiction, Pohl recalled {{in his memoirs}} that John W.

Sprague de Camp's Genus Homo, in the March 1941 Super Science Stories, and Robert Heinlein's [...] "Let There Be Light" [...] and [...] "Lost Legacy" [...] in the May 1940 and November 1941 issues: these were stories which, in Pohl's opinion, [...] "would have looked good anywhere".

Pat Miller, executive secretary of the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System, said the system wasn't aware of Phantasmagoria or Sierra's products, and that it invested in Cendant because it's part of an index fund of the 500 best stocks in the country. Miller added that, if the retirement system finds a problem with Sierra On-Line, it would ask Cendant to cease ownership in the company, and that the system would divest its stock if it refused. Miller said: [...] "We're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> invest in some company that does something that will be detrimental to our children.

[...] Richard Ellis, Richard Fernicola, and Michael Capuzzo suggest that the 1916 Jersey Shore attacks, Coppleson's rogue shark theory, and the exploits of New York fisherman Frank Mundus inspired Benchley. While Benchley states Mundus was an inspiration for Quint, he has denied the book was inspired by attacks off New Jersey in 1916.
