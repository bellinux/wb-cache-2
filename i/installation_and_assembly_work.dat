New models was based on Lviv - [...] "Vohnyk" [...] with kinescope 47 cm and [...] "Electron" [...] with 59 cm kinescope, production of which began in 1963. These models were the base for almost all televisions in the USSR.At the same time, the LTF was established big complex <b>installation,</b> <b>assembly</b> <b>and</b> adjustment <b>work</b> for the production of television sets - 22 conveyor line with aerial system. Except television, launched another high-tech electronic, military and space products,. Factory collaborated with the Institute of Cybernetics, Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR in 1967, together with this institution was established automated control system [...] "Lviv", which was later adopted as a standard in several branches of engineering USSR.From 1966 Lviv TVs exported to over 30 countries. In 1968 TV [...] "Electron" [...] and [...] "Vohnyk" [...] first in the industry received State Quality Mark. LTF became the first Soviet enterprise, which began mass production of color television sets - a test batch released in 1968, and from 1970 established mass production of televisions [...] "Electron-703" [...] (the first Soviet series of color TV sets).|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} an <b>installation</b> <b>and</b> <b>assembly</b> device <b>and</b> method for facilitating the fitup of mating components during blind or remote <b>installation</b> <b>and</b> <b>assembly,</b> especially where close fitup tolerances are involved. The present invention is particularly {{useful for the}} purpose of facilitating vertical and/or radial relative positioning of a pump impeller within a mating inlet nozzle during a blind assembly wherein actual fitup cannot be observed during installation. The information within identifies just one successful application of the <b>installation</b> <b>and</b> <b>assembly</b> alignment device for a pump. The device, however, is not solely limited to pump assembly but can be used in other cases where fitup of a sleeve inside a mating bore is required under conditions of close tolerance during a blind or remote assembly. The device is likewise not limited to circular configurations but can be used for many other shapes or configurations. Any material that can be machined and hold reasonably close tolerances can be used for the device. Also, because the sleeve position is adjusted by set screws or bolts, the concentricity can be radially biased, if required, to achieve particular alignment conditions...|$|R

40|$|New {{technologies}} {{which are}} mainly based {{on high speed}} and precision (robots, manipulators, machine tools, etc.) impose special requirements for gears. Other technologies such as telescopes, radar systems, antenna systems, etc., require high accuracy and speed of positioning.

So, {{it is important that}} gears do not have excessive internal backlash. Harmonic drive gears are one of the newer gears which in there is no internal backlash. Harmonic drive gears have other advantages such as high capacity output bearing, high torque capacity, excellent positioning accuracy and repeatability, compact design, high single stage ratios, high torsional stiffness, high efficiency, simple <b>installation</b> <b>and</b> <b>assembly,</b> etc. In this paper it is described some cases of using Harmonic drive gear in machine tools...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, {{the method}} of {{finishing}} interior spaces, as well as exterior surfaces and architectural and structural elements of buildings and structures is widely used, when layers of building materials or finishing structures are applied in a strict sequence, allowing them to eventually form an unbroken whole - a “monolith”.

The execution of such a finish is more an art than a reproduced with a given level of quality of results by a technological process.

40|$|Manual work (e. g. {{operating}} machinery or <b>installation</b> <b>and</b> <b>assembly</b> tasks) are {{of great importance}} in civilian everyday life and military standard duties. However, numerous circumstances (carrying loads, exposure to cold etc.) may lead to restrictions in manual dexterity or coordination and reduction in hand grip strength. Thus, suitable assessment methods are needed to quantify such effects. A steadiness test to quantify hand-steadiness (Leyk et al. 2006) and a method to measure hand-grip strength (Leyk et al. 2007) have been successfully deployed to assess changes in hand tremor {{as well as in}} force-time courses of hand-grip strength before and after stretcher carriage (Leyk et al. 2006).
