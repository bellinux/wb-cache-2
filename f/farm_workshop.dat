The integrated energy system has been recently installed at Iowa State University 2 ̆ 7 s McNay Memorial Research Center. The project was initiated to provide information to Iowa farmers and small industries concerning the operation of wood-fired energy systems and the management of domestic energy resources for potential substitution for imported heating energy. The McNay energy system includes the various processes required to convert wood energy {{on the ground to}} energy at point of actual use for space heating;Optimum operating conditions for maximum boiler system performance were determined experimentally by employing quadratic central composite design. The three independent variables such as primary air damper (PAD) opening, Secondary air damper (SAD), and depth of fuel bed (DFB) were varied to determine their effect on the wood-fired boiler system efficiency. A total of 20 performance tests were conducted.

50|$|When Pond <b>Farm</b> <b>Workshops</b> {{fell apart}} in 1953, {{nearly all the}} {{residents}} left. Thereafter, a school and workshop on the site, called Pond Farm Pottery, were carried on by the community’s only remaining artist, Bauhaus potter Marguerite Wildenhain, who continued to offer instruction through 1980. Among her students was Dean Schwarz, co-founder of South Bear School, who studied at Pond Farm during the 1960s. University of Utah Professor of Art, Dorothy Bearnson, participated in seven summer workshops with Wildenhain between 1947 and 1964.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, Marguerite Wildenhain {{ended up}} in California and (having {{explored}} other options) decided to join the Herrs’ Pond <b>Farm</b> <b>Workshops.</b> She moved to Pond Farm in 1942, helped to put in water lines, established a garden, built a house and, working with Gordon Herr, restored and redesigned a barn that became her pottery workshop. Later, in 1949, on property adjacent {{to the entrance of}} the Armstrong Redwood Forest, the Herrs began construction of a building called the Hexagon House, where students could be housed and fed, and where public gatherings could be held.|$|R
50|$|To further its {{objective}} of Germanization, Nazi Germany endeavoured {{to increase the}} number of 'Volksdeutsche' in the conquered territories by a policy of Germanising certain classes of the conquered people, mainly those among the Czechs, Poles, and Slovenes who had German ancestors. Thus, the Nazis encouraged the Polish offspring of Germans, or Poles who had family connections with Germans, to join the 'Volksliste', often applying pressure to compel registration. Those who joined enjoyed a privileged status and received special benefits. Registrants were given better food, apartments, <b>farms,</b> <b>workshops,</b> furniture, and clothing—much of it having been confiscated from Jews and Poles who were deported or sent to Nazi concentration camps.|$|R
50|$|Marguerite Wildenhain was {{the first}} artist to accept the Herrs’ {{invitation}} to join the Pond <b>Farm</b> <b>Workshops.</b> In 1947, {{they were joined by}} Frans Wildenhain, who, having been drafted into the German Army during World War II, had been separated from his wife for seven years. Franz would teach sculpture, while two other European artists who joined the colony in 1949, Trude Guermonprez and Victor Ries, taught weaving and metals, respectively. Gordon Herr taught architecture, and Jane Herr served as an informal business manager. In addition to the resident artists, others participated as visiting artists and instructors, including Jean Varda (collage), David Stewart (painting), Claire Falkenstein (painting), Lucienne Bloch (fresco), Stephen Dimitroff (fresco), Harry Dixon (metals) and others.|$|R
50|$|Pond Farm (also {{known as}} Pond <b>Farm</b> <b>Workshops)</b> was an American artists’ colony {{that began in}} the 1940s and, in one form or another, {{continued}} until 1985. It was located near the Russian River resort town of Guerneville, California, about 75 mi north of San Francisco. Situated on a hilltop 600 ft above the Armstrong Redwoods State Reserve, Pond Farm began around 1939-40 when a San Francisco-based couple named Gordon and Jane Herr (architect and writer, respectively) acquired a portion of property called Rancho Del Lago or the Walker Ranch. Initially 250 acre, their property was later expanded to 400 acre. Because one of its primary features was a large pond, the Herrs renamed this setting Pond Farm.|$|R
5000|$|The estate briefly flourished under Tsar Alexis and his {{daughter}} Sophia Alekseyevna, being {{the center of a}} large estate park with model <b>farms,</b> <b>workshops</b> and hunting reserves. The heart of the estate, the Izmailovo Court of Tsar Alexis (Государев двор в Измайлово, [...] ), was a wooden palace built on an artificial island - a hill surrounded by man-made ponds. The present-day Court retains two sets of palace gates, a cathedral and a barbican tower built in the 1670s-1680s. Other extant structures of the Court were built by Konstantin Thon and Mikhail Bykovsky in 1839-1859, when the island was converted into an almshouse, and in the 1970s. The present-day Court is a freely accessible open-air museum.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the initial}} {{building}} programme was not completed until 1876, the first patients, {{all of them}} pauper lunatics from the Kent County Asylum at Barming Heath, {{had been able to}} move in the previous year. The first medical superintendent was Robert Spencer. The asylum was originally managed by a committee of quarter sessions, with responsibility passing to Kent County Council in 1889. In 1920 Kent County Mental Hospitals Committee took over the management and the asylum was renamed Kent County Mental Hospital, Chartham. The hospital became a self-contained village, with its own <b>farm,</b> <b>workshops,</b> baker, butcher, fire-brigade, church, graveyard, gasworks, cricket team, band, etc. Male patients worked on the farm, while female patients worked in the laundry or as seamstresses.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1940, {{the village}} institutes {{started to be}} founded in the fields which are cultivable. In these schools founded at 21 {{different}} regions of Turkey, the teachers would teach villagers both {{how to read and}} write and modern agriculture methods. Instead of education based on just books, they taught people by practicing things in the right place. With this purpose, all the schools had their own fields, <b>farms,</b> <b>workshops</b> and animals. Until its closure, a lot of fields became useful for agriculture and the production in these fields increased. A great number of warehouses, new roads and buildings were built by the people educating at these schools. Until 1954 when they were closed, 1.308 women and 15.943 men, namely totally 17.251 people were educated as teachers.|$|R

50|$|In 1939, Gordon Herr {{traveled}} to Europe {{to search for}} artists whose beliefs and personalities might be compatible with his own. While in Putten, the Netherlands, he met the proprietors of the Het Kruike (Little Jug) pottery shop.

Herr urged them to emigrate to the U.S., {{in order to become}} a part of Pond <b>Farm</b> <b>Workshops.</b> The Wildenhains hesitated initially, but only six months later, when the Nazis invaded Poland, they wrote to Herr, asking if his offer stood. It did, and on March 3, 1940, Marguerite departed for the U.S. Her husband, however, was left behind, because the quota for German citizens had been filled. She was Jewish, he was not.|$|R

5000|$|The Pond <b>Farm</b> <b>Workshops,</b> as {{they became}} known, ran from 1949-1952 and were run by Gordon Herr, Marguerite and Franz Wildenhain, {{and two other}} artist colleagues, textile artist Trude Guermonprez (born Jalowetz) and metals artist Victor Ries. Collage artist Jean Varda and {{sculptor}} Claire Falkenstein also taught at Pond Farm once per week. In these demanding workshops, focused on using the Bauhaus-style kick wheel, students created hundreds of ceramic forms such as flower pots, bowls, pitchers, cups, and tea pots. During the workshops, the students focused on the mastery of process rather than the glazing and firing of wares. During breaks, students and teachers discussed topics such as nature and music, philosophy, leaf structure, and bookkeeping. The Pond Farm truly functioned as a [...] "school for life".
