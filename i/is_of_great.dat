The chest, located in Zadar, <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> importance for the history of the city, as it depicts various historical events– such as the death of her father– and Elizabeth herself. According to legend, she stole the saint's finger and paid for {{the creation of the}} casket in order to atone for her sin. The casket contains a scene which allegedly depicts the queen gone mad after stealing the relict.|$|E
5|$|The E751 route <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> {{importance}} for economy and tourist industry of Istria and Slovenian Littoral, as it links {{a large number}} of resorts to motorway systems in Slovenia and Croatia, providing a significant access route for thousands of motoring tourists. These resorts include Brijuni National Park, Fažana, Rovinj, Poreč, Novigrad, Umag, Piran and Portorož {{on either side of the}} Croatian–Slovenian border. Furthermore, two endpoints of the E751 are located in vicinity of two major Adriatic seaports: the Port of Rijeka and the Port of Koper.|$|E
5|$|The park {{is among}} the most biologically diverse of Turkey's {{national}} parks. It is the native and migratory habitat of hundreds of species of birds, mammals, plants, and marine life, some of which are entirely endemic to the park and cannot be observed anywhere else in the world. For these reasons, it is protected by numerous wildlife and wetland conventions, and <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> national and international importance in these areas.|$|E

Take {{the circle}} S1 {{to be the}} equator, and sweep each point on it to one point above (the North Pole), producing the northern hemisphere, and to one point below (the South Pole), producing the southern hemisphere. For each positive integer n, the n-sphere x02 + x12 + ⋯ + x'n2 = 1 has as equator the (n minus& 1)-sphere x02 + x12 + ⋯ + x'n−12 = 1, and the suspension ΣS'n−1 produces S'n.|$|E
5|$|Design plays a {{vital role}} in product and brand development, and <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> {{economic}} importance for organisations and companies. Creativity and design in particular (as an activity: design skills, methods and processes) play a growing role in creating products and services with high added value to consumers. Design generates 50% of world export revenue in the creative industries' products (goods and services). The creative industry workforce is 3.1% of total employment in the European Union (EU), which creates a revenue that is 2.6% of the EU gross value. Creative industries have attained an unprecedented average annual growth rate of 8.7 per cent across the EU between 2000 and 2005.|$|E
5|$|The {{difference}} between teleosts and other bony fish lies mainly in their jaw bones; teleosts have a movable premaxilla and corresponding modifications {{in the jaw}} musculature which {{make it possible for}} them to protrude their jaws outwards from the mouth. This <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> advantage, enabling them to grab prey and draw it into the mouth. In more derived teleosts, the enlarged premaxilla is the main tooth-bearing bone, and the maxilla, which is attached to the lower jaw, acts as a lever, pushing and pulling the premaxilla as the mouth is opened and closed. Other bones further back in the mouth serve to grind and swallow food. Another difference is that the upper and lower lobes of the tail (caudal) fin are about equal in size. The spine ends at the caudal peduncle, distinguishing this group from other fish in which the spine extends into the upper lobe of the tail fin.|$|E

5|$|The large {{figure of}} Jonah <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>great</b> {{significance}} to the total composition, both pictorially and theologically, being symbolic of the Risen Christ. The figure occupies the pendentive which rises from the altar wall to support the vault, and strains backward, his eyes turned towards God. The foreshortening described by Vasari was innovative and highly influential to later painters. The cleaning of this significant figure has left a few remnants of black shadow visible to the extreme {{left side of the}} painting. All the other, less intense, black lines and washes have been removed, lessening the impact of the radical foreshortening, and also robbing the great fish, the genii behind Jonah, and the architectural figures of much detail.|$|E
