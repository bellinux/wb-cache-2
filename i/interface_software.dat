40|$|Ad hoc <b>software</b> <b>interfacing</b> {{occurs when}} one must {{programmatically}} move data from software system A to software system B where A and B were {{never intended to}} interoperate. Ad hoc <b>software</b> <b>interfacing</b> is a common way to construct new, larger software systems from other software systems, by using them as large-grained components. Ad hoc <b>software</b> <b>interfacing,</b> also known as “glue coding”, “low level software interfacing”, etc., has historically been relegated to less skilled programmers who are incapable of developing elegant and maintainable solutions. Ad hoc <b>software</b> <b>interfacing</b> needs a precise framework in which to specify problems and generate solutions. This paper describes a framework based {{on the principles of}} domain-specific language techniques. We demonstrate how many of the features needed for ad hoc <b>software</b> <b>interfacing</b> are available in commercial enterprise application integration servers. 1...|$|R
