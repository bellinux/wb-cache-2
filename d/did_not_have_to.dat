5|$|In 1975, Richard Bulliet of Columbia University {{wrote that}} the {{dromedary}} exists in large numbers in areas from which the Bactrian camel has disappeared; the converse is also true to a great extent. He said this substitution could have taken place because of the heavy dependence on the milk, meat and wool of the dromedary by Syrian and Arabian nomads, while the Asiatic people domesticated the Bactrian camel but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> depend upon its products.|$|E
5|$|In {{the control}} and living spaces, the ship had quieted down, too. Orders were given in low voices; the men speak to each other, {{carrying}} out their normal duties, in a repressed atmosphere. A regular pall has descended upon us. I know that all hands {{are aware of the}} decision and recognize the need for it. Perhaps they are relieved that they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> make it. But it is apparent that this unexpected illness, something that could neither have been foreseen nor prevented, may ruin our submergence record.|$|E

5|$|KaDee Strickland portrays Dr. Charlotte King, {{who also}} {{works as a}} {{hospital}} administrator. Strickland's character {{was introduced in the}} first season and did not make an appearance in the backdoor pilot. Her addition to the main cast was announced on July 11, 2007, prior to the commencement of the first season. Strickland <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> audition for the role, but was cast after a meeting with Rhimes.|$|E
5|$|Reginald Yzendoorn, {{author of}} History of the Catholic Mission in the Hawaiian Islands, later wrote that Kaʻauwai was {{a judge and}} Calvinist deacon who related the burning of the Roman Catholic chapel of Wailuku in 1843 to his {{mother-in-law}} Marie Leahi, an early Catholic female catechumen. In the early Hawaiian Protestant mission, deacons <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be licensed to preach.|$|E
5|$|Sakura is {{voiced by}} Yui Makino in the anime adaptation, and by Monica Rial in the English adaptation. Sakura's {{character}} was Makino's first {{work as a}} voice actress and she states she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> adjust her voice for that, finding the character similar to her. During the series' original video animations (OVAs), Makino mentioned that one of Sakura's scenes was very sad, and worked to make it appealing.|$|E

5|$|The {{packaging}} for {{the book}} is made of aluminium, which was Madonna's idea, and is spiral bound and enclosed in a Mylar sheet. Due to the scandalous nature of the photographs and the media mayhem surrounding it from the initial preview of the book, Madonna <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> promote Sex, except for a pre-release party and some television specials. Her publishers were extremely apprehensive about the release {{as well as its}} commercial potential. Sex was released alongside her fifth studio album Erotica, which went on sale a day earlier.|$|E
5|$|Two earlier {{business}} decisions by the Chicago Sun-Times led to substantial savings {{of time and}} money during the Trump Tower's construction. The original 1950s sea wall was built by the newspaper company to bomb-shelter thickness, to withstand a Cold War attack, and thus <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be broken down and rebuilt. Furthermore, the company decided in the 1970s to switch from petroleum-based to soy-based ink, which reduced ground pollution from the printing plant. This considerably reduced the costs and time for cleaning up the site prior to building anew.|$|E
5|$|While Fossett had financed five {{previous}} tries himself, {{his successful}} record-setting flight {{was sponsored by}} Bud Light. In the end, Fossett actually made money on all his balloon flights. He bought a contingency insurance policy for $500,000 that would pay him $3 million if he succeeded in the flight. Along with sponsorship, that payout meant {{that in the end}} Fossett <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> spend any of his money other than for initial expenses.|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} later, {{in the wake}} of the scandal, Waugh was widely jeered by an Australian crowd when he walked out to bat on the first day of the Test. In what he {{described}} as the toughest day of his career, Waugh gave an unconvincing and hesitant performance. Waugh managed only seven runs in 36 minutes before being removed by Peter Such, caught and bowled. The cricket writer Peter Roebuck opined that it was the worst home crowd reception for an Australian player that he could remember. Warne was injured at the time and did not play, so he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> face the hostile crowd.|$|E
5|$|A {{fleet of}} 40 AEC Routemaster buses were {{purchased}} from London Transport in 1986 {{to launch the}} new services in competition with Strathclyde Buses. Kelvin had not previously employed conductors, but introduced them for these services. This meant the vehicles <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> spend as long loading at bus stops as one-person operated buses {{and were able to}} offer quicker journeys through Glasgow. The Routemasters proved popular with both passengers and staff and continued to operate into the 1990s under successor company Kelvin Central, {{which was one of the}} last operators of the type in regular service in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|After {{construction}} of the Skinners FallsMilanville Bridge was completed in late 1902, tolls were immediately charged along the one lane structure. However, unlike the other two bridges, the Skinners FallsMilanville Bridge cost $0.22 (1902 USD). A person traveling on foot <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay to cross the structure. This decision was different {{compared to the other}} bridges, which made it separate. Another decision was that ministers were not tolled so they could better serve their communities. However, when one minister began to abuse the special privilege, he was charged $0.05 for crossing. The tollhouse for collection was in Milanville and was run by the Dexter family.|$|E

25|$|Charter {{schools are}} state funded schools which operate {{outside of the}} normal state system. They began in 2014 with 5 small schools. Charter schools <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> operate with any {{registered}} or trained teachers. Teachers <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> current practicing certificates. They <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a principal. They are allowed to benefit from profit making. They <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> follow the national curriculum. They receive approximately 3 times the level of funding per student than normal state schools. If the charter school roll drops during the year, the school keeps the extra funding, unlike normal state schools, where funding is matched to students actually attending. If a charter school fails the management/owners are allowed to keep the land and buildings and other capital assets. Charter schools have less compliance with regulations than State schools although teachers must undergo police vetting.|$|R
5|$|At {{its most}} fundamental, {{it was a}} local feud between two {{competing}} dynastic interests—the Seneschals (Truchsess) of the House of Waldburg and the dukes of the House of Wittelsbach—that acquired religious overtones. The dispute had broad implications in the political, social, and dynastic balance of the Holy Roman Empire. It tested the principle of ecclesiastical reservation established in the religious Peace of Augsburg (1555). The 1555 agreement settled religious problems in the Empire with the principle Cuius regio, eius religio: the subjects of a secular prince followed the religion of their sovereign. Ecclesiastical reservation excluded the territories of the imperial prelates (bishops, archbishops, abbots or abbesses) from cuius regio, eius religio. In an ecclesiastical territory, if the prelate changed his religion, his subjects <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do so. Instead, the prelate was expected to resign from his post. Problematically, the 1555 agreement did not specify this detail.|$|E
5|$|Automatic {{closure of}} public schools which racially {{integrate}} — The legislation required that any school which integrated (voluntarily or not) must be immediately and automatically closed. However, the governor was given the discretion to take over integrated school(s) and reopen the school(s) on a segregated basis rather than close the entire district. Integrated schools <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> stay closed, however. A school district could petition the governor to take over one or more schools (or the entire district) that had closed and reopen them as segregated schools. Whether exercising his discretion or acting on a petition from the school district, the governor was authorized to act only {{as an agent of}} the Assembly. The governor was also required to try to persuade the African American child to return to his or her racially segregated school, so that the schools could reopen on a segregated basis.|$|E
5|$|Bethe left Germany in 1933, {{moving to}} England after {{receiving}} an offer {{for a position}} as lecturer at the University of Manchester for a year through Sommerfeld's connection to William Lawrence Bragg. He moved in with his friend Rudolf Peierls and Peierls' wife Genia. Peierls was a fellow German physicist who had also been barred from academic positions in Germany because his parents were Jewish. This meant that Bethe had someone to speak to in German, and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> eat English food. Their relationship was professional as well as personal. Peierls aroused Bethe's interest in nuclear physics. After James Chadwick and Maurice Goldhaber discovered the photodisintegration of deuterium, Chadwick challenged Bethe and Peierls {{to come up with}} a theoretical explanation of this phenomenon. This they did on the four-hour train ride from Cambridge back to Manchester. Bethe would investigate further in the years ahead.|$|E

5|$|By September 25, 24 {{exhibition}} {{games were}} canceled and training camps were postponed indefinitely {{as a result}} of stalled talks. Further negotiating sessions took place in October and November, but no agreement was reached. The season's first two weeks were officially canceled on October 13, and 99 games scheduled for November were lost as a result. It {{was the first time in}} NBA history that games were canceled due to a labor dispute. On October 20, arbitrator John Feerick ruled that the owners <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay players with guaranteed contracts during the lockout. Feerick's decision gave the owners leverage in bargaining talks. Another factor favoring the owners was that their teams received money from the NBA's television broadcasters, whose contracts with the league called for payments to be made if games were not played.|$|E
5|$|During their {{fighting}} retreat up the Rhône, the Germans also withdrew {{their remaining}} forces from their garrisons in south-western France. These divisions raced {{north along the}} Atlantic coast and then swung towards the east at the Loire to link up {{with the rest of}} Army GroupG at Burgundy. While they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> fight the Western Allies as much as the Germans had done at the Rhône, they still had to advance through French partisan-dominated terrain. About 88,000 men moved north, leaving 20,000 in south-western France behind. During the retreat, about 19,000 men were captured by the Allies and 60,000 men reached Army GroupG's line, where they were integrated into the defense of the Vosges mountains.|$|E
5|$|Goblet of Fire was {{the first}} book in the Harry Potter series to be {{released}} in the United States on the same date as the United Kingdom, on 8 July 2000, strategically on a Saturday so children <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> worry about school conflicting with buying the book. It had a combined first-printing of over five million copies. It was given a record-breaking print run of 3.9 million. Three million copies of the book were sold over the first weekend in the US alone. FedEx dispatched more than 9,000 trucks and 100 planes to fulfill book deliveries. The pressure in editing caused a mistake which shows Harry's father emerging first from Voldemort's wand; however, as confirmed in Prisoner of Azkaban, James died first, so then Harry's mother ought to have come out first. This was corrected in later editions.|$|E
