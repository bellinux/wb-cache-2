5|$|The {{most common}} form of self-harm <b>is</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> sharp object to cut one's skin, but self-harm also covers a wide range of {{behaviours}} including burning, scratching, banging or hitting body parts, interfering with wound healing (dermatillomania), hair-pulling (trichotillomania) and the ingestion of toxic substances or objects. Behaviours associated with substance abuse and eating disorders are usually not considered self-harm because the resulting tissue damage is ordinarily an unintentional side effect. However, the boundaries are not always clearly defined and in some cases behaviours that usually fall outside the boundaries of self-harm may indeed represent self-harm if performed with explicit intent to cause tissue damage. Although suicide is not the intention of self-harm, the relationship between self-harm and suicide is complex, as self-harming behaviour may be potentially life-threatening. There is also an increased risk of suicide in individuals who self-harm and self-harm is found in 40–60% of suicides. However, generalising self-harmers to be suicidal is, in the majority of cases, inaccurate.|$|E
5|$|The run starts by {{introducing}} two main antagonists, an aging politician, who <b>is</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> strange portal to enter other people's minds and commit crimes, and Mako, a cannibalistic mage who devours other magicians {{in order to}} obtain their power. Constantine's attempt to play them off one another only succeeds in making them join forces in a further plot. Constantine then traps them both with considerable ease, and questions how this has been so easy. It then becomes apparent that he has been manipulated by the 'Golden Child', his twin who did not survive childbirth, and has been manipulating events for the whole of the series, including his battle with cancer and many other events. He declines his twin's offer to merge souls, suspicious that his twin has been weakening his will in past years to make him accept this offer, choosing instead to take control of his own destiny.|$|E

25|$|For best results, a Pap test {{should not}} occur {{when a woman}} is menstruating, partly because the {{additional}} cells can obscure cervical cells, and partly because {{this part of the}} menstrual cycle is when the female organs are most inflamed/LINK/. However, Pap smears can be performed during a woman's menstrual period, especially if the physician <b>is</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> liquid-based test; if bleeding is extremely heavy, endometrial cells can obscure cervical cells, and it is therefore inadvisable to have a Pap smear if bleeding is excessive.|$|E

25|$|In Zombi U, a first-person {{survival}} horror game set in London, {{the player}} is {{a survivor of}} a zombie apocalypse.

The player has a number of ways to deal with enemies, and can confront the zombies with firearms, land mines, and Molotov cocktails. They can use an unbreakable cricket bat, which does less damage than other weapons. There are several types of zombies, including those which explode, are armored, or spill corrosive fluid. The zombies are sensitive to light, and are attracted to a player who <b>is</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> flashlight or flare. Sound produced by firearms will also attract nearby enemies to a player, who can push them away with their weapon. The player can also use stealth to avoid being noticed by enemies.|$|E
25|$|In the {{previous}} Oz book, The Emerald City of Oz, magic {{was used to}} isolate Oz from all outside worlds.

He explains that a child suggested he make contact with Oz with wireless telegraphy. Glinda, using her book that records everything that happens, is able to know that someone <b>is</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> telegraph to contact Oz, so she erects a telegraph tower and has the Shaggy Man, who knows how to make a telegraph reply, tell the story contained in this book to Baum.|$|E
25|$|Having {{training}} aids {{may make it}} easier to become comfortable with riding a unicycle. One method for training <b>is</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> spotter to make riding easier. One other easy way to learn is to find a narrow hallway {{that can be used to}} help alleviate left and right balancing while allowing a beginner to focus on forward and backward balance. If a hallway cannot be found, a fence or clothes line is suitable. Equally, riding back and forth between two chairs, faced back to back, whilst holding on to the chair backs allows the user to gauge how to appropriately position oneself before setting off. Using props such as sticks or ski poles is generally discouraged as they hinder balance and create dependence. A fall onto props could also cause serious injury.|$|E
