Weiss added, [...] "The more we thought about it, Jon is going to come up against so many old guys with beards in the North that like 'What if she was a tougher audience?' It seemed like an inherently fun scene to watch, it also is terrifying because it's putting a lot of dramatic weight on the shoulders of somebody who needs to be very young." [...] David Benioff concluded the featurette speaking about the Ironborn story, noting [...] "Yara's not a therapist, in our kind of sense of the word, she's not there to tell him to 'buck up' and 'everything's going to be okay,' it's a pretty brutal kind of therapy, but that's who they are, I mean they're essentially a Viking people. There's not {{a lot of room for}} sort of soft, and gentle psychology. I think it's the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>tough</b> love Theon needed at this point, and when he finally raises his eyes, and looks into her eyes, we see a glimpse of the old Theon that had been lost for so long." ...|$|E

60|$|The boat {{took many}} such grassy corners and {{followed}} many such reedy and silent reaches of river; {{but before the}} search had become monotonous they had swung round a specially sharp angle and come into the silence of a sort of pool or lake, the sight of which instinctively arrested them. For {{in the middle of}} this wider piece of water, fringed on every side with rushes, lay a long, low islet, along which ran a long, low house or bungalow built of bamboo or some <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>tough</b> tropic cane. The upstanding rods of bamboo which made the walls were pale yellow, the sloping rods that made the roof were of darker red or brown, otherwise the long house was a thing of repetition and monotony. The early morning breeze rustled the reeds round the island and sang in the strange ribbed house as in a giant pan-pipe.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Beckinsale starred {{opposite}} Sam Rockwell in {{the independent}} drama Snow Angels, {{based on the novel}} by Stewart O'Nan.

[...] "I did have my kid, my husband and, in fact, my ex was around a lot, so it was very nice to come home to my people whom I love." [...] Puig felt [...] "Beckinsale gives her best performance in years" [...] while Richard Corliss of Time described it as [...] "her sharpest work yet." [...] However, Scott felt that [...] "her skill and discipline cannot overcome the sense that she is an exotic species transplanted into this grim ecosystem. Hard as she works to convince us otherwise, it’s a stretch to believe that a woman with the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> poised confidence in her own beauty she manifests would wind up with an underachieving mouth breather like Glenn."

[...] "The Kaufman Center is <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> rough and <b>tough,</b> because <b>of</b> the Brutalist aesthetic of the building. It's a powerful building, with good, strong bones, but it's a little short on grace notes." [...] Most noticeably, a new marquee unifies the entrances to both Merkin Concert Hall and the two schools. [...] "It visibly unites under one marquee all three parts of the Kaufman Center physically and psychologically," [...] Kontos remarked.|$|R

5000|$|In [...] "Business Ethics", Meredith reveals she {{has been}} {{sleeping}} with a supplier {{in order to gain}} discounts on products for the company (and Outback Steakhouse gift certificates). Holly Flax thinks she should be fired, while Michael Scott tries to lead her into giving a non-damning statement (though he calls her a [...] "stupid bag" [...] when she simply restates her unethical behavior). She says she won't quit, but ultimately it turns out Corporate could not care less about her actions and actually seem to find them <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> useful in <b>tough</b> economic times. In deleted scenes, it's revealed Meredith made racist comments that Stanley overheard (though they weren't about him), that she admits she has no skill set to do any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> useful work, and that she likes working at Dunder Mifflin because she can show up for work at 11AM and leave at 4PM (this last bit of information comes as a shock to Michael).|$|R

However, in order to utilize this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> data, a <b>tough</b> task is required to be accomplished.

Especially, the designed system utilizes the scale property in processing. The core of the processing system is a wavelet-based algorithm, which can detect edge of object depending on scale and as a result, the objects with different sizes are distinguished. Afterwards, perceptual grouping, which is based on proximity, elevation and object boundary, is applied on laser cloud point to finalize the segmentation. This paper concentrates in the designing stage of system development. The work is carrying on with system implementation and evaluation, which will be presented in the later papers. 1...|$|R

5000|$|The {{involvement}} of cannabis {{in the creation}} of [...] "stoner rock/metal" [...] can range between bands in the genre. Bands such as Sleep have involved the concept of cannabis {{to be part of the}} core of their albums and songs. The consumption of cannabis is common in the live performances of some stoner rock/metal bands, and bands such as Electric Wizard are known to have concerts with the band members and the crowd participating in smoking cannabis. [...] Dopesmoker by Sleep received controversy because the 60-minute song is about cannabis, which resulted in conflict with Sleep's record company. While other members of the genre state that [...] "stoner rock is a style, not life," [...] which is interpreted as the band members do not participate in smoking cannabis or are influenced by cannabis, however the style of their music reflects the sound of [...] "stoner rock/metal." [...] Bands such as King Caravan and Sea of Green have come under terms with this statement. [...] Similarly, Matt Pike from the band High on Fire stated, [...] "It's a very strong scene, but I don't think any of the stoner rock bands want to be labeled as stoner rock ... I might use the word 'stoner' in my lyrics, but I think we're metal, dude. I'd say I was crossover metal, actually, or progressive metal. It's <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a <b>tough</b> thing to lump into a category, but I guess we get the stoner-rock label because of the whole pot thing." ...|$|R
40|$|Numbers of {{incidents}} regarding {{the failure of}} the temporary structure were widely reported due to the windstorm in Malaysia. The incidents cause injuries and fatalities to people. The canopy structure is one of the temporary structures that widely used in Malaysian surroundings during the small occasion ceremony. Due to the lack of information, mitigation <b>of</b> this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> hazard is <b>tough</b> to be mitigated. The most important parameter is the potential wind speed that can cause the failure to the canopy. Previous study conducted this structures can be classified as free standing canopy structures. However there are no specific studies conducted for common canopy used in Malaysia. Two common type of canopy structure were identified and analysis due to wind load. Type A is 3 m x 3 m and Type B is 6 m x 6 m. The canopy was imposed with two different major direction of wind load. From the result type A canopy will possibility fail at 11 m/s while type B at 13 m/s. Therefore this result information can be use to mitigate the risk of failure on canopy structures due to wind load...|$|R
5000|$|As the {{population}} boomed, by 1878 Leadville had the {{reputation as one}} of the most lawless towns in the West. The first city marshal was run out of town a few days after he was appointed and his replacement was shot dead within a month by one of his deputies. Fearing the town would be lost to the lawless element, Mayor Horace Tabor sent for Mart Duggan, who was living in Denver, as a replacement. Duggan is little-known today, but was well known as a fearless gunfighter. Using strong-arm and lawless tactics, during his two stints as marshal Duggan brought order to Leadville by 1880 when he stepped down. He was shot and killed in 1889 by an unknown assailant, most likely an enemy he had made when he was a Leadville marshal. Historian Robert Dearment writes: [...] "Mart Duggan was a quick-shooting, hard-drinking, brawling tough Irish man, but he was exactly the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> man a <b>tough,</b> hard-drinking, quick-shooting camp like Leadville needed in its earliest days. His name is all but forgotten today but the name 'Matt Dillon' is recognized around the world. Such are the vagaries of life." ...|$|R

The analysis accounts {{for a wide range}} <b>of</b> interactions between <b>tough</b> constructions and other phenomena, which have not been previously focused on in the literature...|$|R
