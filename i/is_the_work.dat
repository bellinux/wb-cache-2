5|$|Il ritorno, says Carter, {{is clearly}} {{influenced}} by Monteverdi's earlier works. Penelope's lament in Act I is close in character to the lament from L'Arianna, while the martial episodes recall Il combattimento. Stile concitato is {{prominent in the}} fight scenes and in the slaying of Penelope's suitors. In L'incoronazione, Monteverdi represents moods and situations by specific musical devices: triple metre stands for the language of love; arpeggios demonstrate conflict; stile concitato represents rage. There is continuing debate about {{how much of the}} extant L'incoronazione music is Monteverdi's original, and how much <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of others (there are, for instance, traces of music by Francesco Cavalli).|$|E
5|$|Palacio de Congresos de Badajoz, {{the congressional}} palace, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> {{of the architects}} José Selgas and Lucia Cano. Palacio Municipal houses the City Hall. The remains of the {{original}} City Hall building are in ruins. The current building dates to 1852, and the clock was added in 1889. In 1937, the municipal architect, Rodolfo Martinez, renovated the building, with particular emphasis on stylistic uniformity, expanding its towers and changing its decorative elements. It features a balustrade, a central balcony and columns.|$|E

5|$|The Skagen Line connects Skagen with Frederikshavn Station in Frederikshavn to the south. Nordjyske Jernbaner {{operates}} a frequent train service between Skagen and Frederikshavn with onward connections by DSB {{to the rest}} of Denmark. Skagen Station, the most northerly railway station in mainland Denmark, is the principal station of the town. Skagen's first station, opened in 1890, was designed by Thomas Arboe. The current building, completed in 1919, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of the architect Ulrik Plesner. The western part of Skagen is also served by the Frederikshavnsvej railway halt.|$|E
5|$|The first Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen, {{designed}} by Elias David Häusser and {{completed in the}} 1740s, was {{certainly one of the}} most impressive Baroque buildings of its day. Although the palace itself was destroyed by fire in 1794, the extensive showgrounds and riding arena completed by Niels Eigtved have survived undamaged and can be visited today. Fredensborg Palace (1731), the royal residence on the shore of Sealand's Lake Esrum, with its exquisite Chancellery House, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Johan Cornelius Krieger who was the court gardener at Rosenborg Castle. The park at Fredensborg is one of Denmark's largest and best preserved Baroque gardens.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{documented}} {{description of}} hare coursing <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> known in English as On Coursing. It {{was written by}} Arrian a Greek historian of the Roman period, circa 180AD and is known in Anicent Greek as Kynegetikos and in Latin as Cynegeticus. Arrian felt compelled to describe the sight hunt and sighthounds because the Ancient Greeks only knew the scent hunt; On Coursing complements Xenophon's classic work on that subject, Cynegeticus (On Hunting). William Dansey, an English clergyman, translated On Coursing in 1831.|$|E

The statue of “Prudence” is it seems based on Prudence Maufe, the wife of the architect; even <b>the</b> shoes <b>are</b> in <b>the</b> style of shoes which she wore. “Hope” and “Justice” <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of <b>the</b> sculptor Richard Browne. “Faith” <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of John Cobbett and “Charity”, “Courage”, “Temperance” and “Prudence” <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Alan Collins. <b>The</b> statue “Faith” <b>was</b> incidentally a gift from the Women’s Royal Army Corps.|$|R
5|$|As Renaissance styles survived {{late in the}} city, the {{appearance}} of Baroque art was also delayed, but from the mid-18th century Klausenburg was once again at {{the centre of the}} development and spread of art in Transylvania, as it had been two centuries earlier. The first enthusiasts for Baroque were the Catholic Church and the landed aristocracy. Artists came initially from south Germany and Austria, {{but by the end of}} the century most of the work was by local craftsmen. The earliest signs of the new style appear in the furnishings of St. Michael's church: the altarpieces and pulpit, which date to the 1740s, are carved, painted and richly decorated with figures. An altarpiece depicting the Adoration of the Magi (1748–50) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Franz Anton Maulbertsch. The earliest two-towered Baroque church was built by the Jesuits from 1718 to 1724 on the pattern of Košice and was later handed over to the Piarists. During the century more simply designed Baroque churches were built for the mendicant orders, Lutherans, Unitarians and the Orthodox Church. The noble families built houses and even palaces in the old town. The Baroque Bánffy Palace (1774–1785), constructed around a rectangular yard, is the masterpiece of Eberhardt Blaumann. Its peculiarity lies in {{the appearance}} of the principal façade.|$|E
5|$|Early Netherlandish {{painting}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of artists, sometimes {{known as}} the Flemish Primitives, active in the Burgundian and Habsburg Netherlands during the 15th- and 16th-century Northern Renaissance; especially in the flourishing cities of Bruges, Ghent, Mechelen, Louvain, Tournai and Brussels, all in contemporary Flanders. Their work follows the International Gothic style and begins approximately with Robert Campin and Jan van Eyck in the early 1420s. It lasts {{at least until the}} death of Gerard David in 1523, although many scholars extend it {{to the start of the}} Dutch Revolt in 1566 or 1568 (Max J. Friedländer's acclaimed surveys run through Pieter Bruegel the Elder). Early Netherlandish painting coincides with the Early and High Italian Renaissance but is seen as an independent artistic culture, separate from the Renaissance humanism that characterised developments in Italy. Because these painters represent the culmination of the northern European medieval artistic heritage and the incorporation of Renaissance ideals, they are sometimes categorised as belonging to both the Early Renaissance and Late Gothic.|$|E
5|$|Frederic G. Kenyon {{opposed to}} the Burkit's view and argued that Cyril firmly {{believed}} in the Egyptian origin of the codex. A. S. Fulton, the Keeper of the Department of Oriental Printed Books and Manuscripts (in British Museum), in 1938 re-examined the Athanasius note, and gave it as his opinion that on palaeographical grounds it could be dated 13th to 14th century and that the 17th century was excluded. In 1945 T. D. Moschonas published a catalogue of the library of the Patriarch of Alexandria, in which he printed two Greek notes, both from 10th-century manuscripts of John Chrysostom, inserted by the Patriarch Athanasius III. The two notes must have been written between 1308 and 1316. Although the note in the Codex Alexandrinus is entirely in Arabic, and therefore no identity of hand the Greek notes can be expected, the similarity of wording leaves no doubt that this also <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of Athanasius III.|$|E

5|$|In 1485 Ivan III {{commissioned}} {{the building of}} the royal residence, Terem Palace, within the Kremlin, with Aloisio da Milano as the architect of the first three floors. He and other Italian architects also contributed to the construction of the Kremlin walls and towers. The small banquet hall of the Russian Tsars, called the Palace of Facets because of its facetted upper story, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of two Italians, Marco Ruffo and Pietro Solario, and shows a more Italian style. In 1505, an Italian known in Russia as Aleviz Novyi or Aleviz Fryazin arrived in Moscow. He may have been the Venetian sculptor, Alevisio Lamberti da Montagne. He built 12 churches for Ivan III, including the Cathedral of the Archangel, a building remarkable for the successful blending of Russian tradition, Orthodox requirements and Renaissance style. It is believed that the Cathedral of the Metropolitan Peter in Vysokopetrovsky Monastery, another work of Aleviz Novyi, later served as an inspiration for the so-called octagon-on-tetragon architectural form in the Moscow Baroque of the late 17th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{colourful}} Buhl altarpiece <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of a {{group of}} followers of Martin Schongauer, who drew their inspiration both from his woodcuts and from his paintings, especially the Altarpiece of the Dominicans, now kept in the Unterlinden Museum. The Buhl painters closely followed their model's designs, but on a larger scale and in a simpler and technically cruder manner. While it is not documented that the altarpiece was commissioned by the convent of Saint Catherine, the closeness to the designs of Schongauer but also, to a lesser degree, of Caspar Isenmann (the panel depicting the Flagellation of Christ is reminding of the same scene in the altarpiece of St Martin's Church) indicate without a doubt that it has been painted in Colmar; furthermore, both Saint Catherine and Saint Ursula, who figure prominently in the Crucifixion scene, were particularly venerated by the Dominican sisters of Saint Catherine.|$|E
