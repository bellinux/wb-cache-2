5|$|Seven {{factories}} {{assembled the}} various {{models of the}} Sd.Kfz. 10. Demag built approximately 1,075 from 1938 to November 1942. Adler-Werke completed 3,414 between 1938 and December 1943. Büssing-NAG built 750 between 1938 and December 1942. MWC assembled 4750 between 1939 and November 1944. Mühlenbau und <b>Industrie</b> A.G. (MIAG) completed 324 between 1939 and 1941. Maschinenfabrik Niedersachsen Hannover (MNH) built about 600 between 1939 and November 1942. Österreichische Saurerwerke completed about 3,075 from 1940 to December 1943. Both Demag and MWC were producing the D 7p chassis for the Sd.Kfz. 250 light APC in 1945 when a shortage of armored bodies meant that 276 had to be completed with wooden upper bodies. Eighty of these {{are known to have}} been delivered by 1 March 1945. These numbers may include 310 chassis built for Sd.Kfz. 252 armored ammunition carriers and Sd.Kfz. 253 oberservation vehicles.|$|E

25|$|There {{are a few}} {{designs of}} fully {{automatic}} couplers in use worldwide, including the Scharfenberg coupler, various knuckle hybrids such as the Tightlock (used in the UK), the Wedgelock coupling, Dellner couplings (similar to Scharfenberg couplers in appearance), BSI coupling (Bergische Stahl <b>Industrie,</b> now Faiveley Transport) and the Schaku-Tomlinson Tightlock coupling.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was structurally redesigned by BDC Aero <b>Industrie</b> for higher gross weights, {{to comply with}} the Canadian Advanced Ultralight rules and US light-sport aircraft rules, in 2006. It features a strut-braced high-wing, a two-seats-in-side-by-side configuration enclosed cockpit with composite doors for access, fixed tricycle landing gear with wheel pants and a single engine in tractor configuration.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the plane}} was {{assembled}} in France the European Aviation Safety Agency (the European counterpart of the FAA) and the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile (the French counterpart of the NTSB) joined the investigation, with technical assistance from Airbus <b>Industrie</b> and GE Aviation/Snecma, respectively the manufacturers of the airframe and the engines.|$|E
25|$|The BDC Aero Puma is a Canadian {{ultralight}} and light-sport aircraft, {{originally designed}} by the Italian aircraft designer Antonio Bortolanza and built by Aeroplast of Sale, Piedmont, Italy.

At one time available as a kit for amateur construction, now the aircraft is supplied only as a complete ready-to-fly-aircraft.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, nuclear {{construction}} and services company Areva {{was created by}} the merger of CEA <b>Industrie,</b> Framatome and Cogema (now Areva NC). Its main shareholder is the French owned company CEA, but the German federal government also holds, through Siemens, 34% of the shares of Areva's subsidiary, Areva NP, in charge of building the EPR (third-generation nuclear reactor).|$|E
25|$|First {{group is}} based on the acid-promoted triple {{dehydration}} of aldaric (mucic) acids. This reaction requires severe conditions (highly concentrated acids, temp > 120°C, React time > 20h) and all the methods were non-selective with yields < 50%. The process has also been patented by the French company Agro <b>Industrie</b> Recherches et Developpements. This is also the process which DuPont and ADM are using according to patent literature.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to its use as a VIP aircraft, a number of Corvettes were procured and operated by regional airlines, such as Air Alsace, Air Alpes, Air Champagne, TAT, and Sterling Airways. Airbus <b>Industrie</b> also operated a small fleet of Corvettes for internal transportation of staff between its key sites across Europe. During late 1976, Aerospatiale, {{as a consequence of}} a low number of orders having been received during three years of production, decided to terminate production of the SN 601 Corvette. While an expanded model, known as the Corvette 200, had been actively studied, development was abandoned following the end of manufacture.|$|E
25|$|In January 2001 Airbus <b>Industrie</b> was {{transformed}} from an inherently inefficient consortium structure to a formal joint stock company, with legal and tax procedures being finalised on 11 July. Both EADS and BAE transferred ownership of their Airbus factories {{to the new}} Airbus SAS in return for 80% and 20% shares in the new company respectively. In April 2001 EADS agreed to merge its missile businesses with those of BAE Systems and Alenia Marconi Systems (BAE/Finmeccanica) to form MBDA. EADS took a 37.5% share of the new company that was formally established in December 2001 and which thus became the world's second-largest missile manufacturer.|$|E
25|$|Airbus <b>Industrie</b> {{arrived at}} the show to promote their A300, {{claiming}} that the longer-ranged A-300B-4 variant would present strong competition in the U.S. domestic market due to operating costs being 5 to 7% lower than the L-1011 and DC-10 trijets. Noting that the original contract {{that led to the}} trivets had called for a twin-engine aircraft, Ken Gordon of Airbus North America claimed that the original specification still needed to be filled. The third engine of the US designs gave them the ETOPS performance needed for trans-Atlantic flights, but were unneeded for flights within North America, which the 300 could meet with lower operational costs. Douglas and Lockheed responded by using the show to pitch two-engine versions of their three-engine designs to compete with the A300.|$|E
25|$|The {{retention}} {{of production and}} engineering assets by the partner companies in effect made Airbus <b>Industrie</b> a sales and marketing company. This arrangement led to inefficiencies due to the inherent conflicts of interest that the four partner companies faced; they were both GIE shareholders of, and subcontractors to, the consortium. The companies collaborated on development of the Airbus range, but guarded the financial details of their own production activities and sought to maximise the transfer prices of their sub-assemblies. It was becoming clear that Airbus {{was no longer a}} temporary collaboration to produce a single plane as per its original mission statement, it had become a long term brand for the development of further aircraft. By the late 1980s work had begun on a pair of new medium-sized aircraft, the biggest to be produced at this point under the Airbus name, the Airbus A330 and the Airbus A340.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s the then Airbus CEO Jean Pierson {{argued that the}} GIE should be {{abandoned}} and Airbus established as a conventional company. However, the difficulties of integrating and valuing the assets of four companies, as well as legal issues, delayed the initiative. In December 1998, when {{it was reported that}} British Aerospace and DASA were close to merging, Aérospatiale paralysed negotiations on the Airbus conversion; the French company feared the combined BAe/DASA, which would own 57.9% of Airbus, would dominate the company and it insisted on a 50/50 split. However, the issue was resolved in January 1999 when BAe abandoned talks with DASA in favour of merging with Marconi Electronic Systems to become BAE Systems. Then in 2000 three of the four partner companies (DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, successor to Deutsche Airbus; Aérospatiale-Matra, successor to Sud-Aviation; and CASA) merged to form EADS, simplifying the process. EADS now owned Airbus France, Airbus Deutschland and Airbus España, and thus 80% of Airbus <b>Industrie.</b> BAE Systems and EADS transferred their production assets to the new company, Airbus SAS, in return for shareholdings in that company.|$|E
25|$|Aside from a {{contract}} that creates a security interest to back repayment of a debt, creditors to a company, and particularly trade creditors may deploy two main equivalents security. The effect is to produce proprietary rights which place them ahead of the general body of creditors. First, a trade creditor who sells goods to a company (which may go into insolvency) can contract for a retention of title clause. This means {{that even though the}} seller of goods may have passed possession to a buyer, until the price of sale is paid, the seller has never passed property. The company and creditor agree that title to the property is retained by the seller until the date of payment. In the leading case, Aluminium <b>Industrie</b> Vaassen BV v Romalpa Aluminium Ltd a Dutch company making aluminium foil stipulated in its contract with Romalpa Aluminium Ltd that when it supplied the foil, ownership would only passed once the price had been paid, and that any products made by Romalpa would be held by them as bailees. When Romalpa went insolvent, another creditor claimed that its floating charge covered the foil and products. The Court of Appeal held, however, that property in the foil had never become part of Romalpa's estate, and so could not be covered by the charge. Furthermore, the clause was not void for want to registration because only assets belonging to the company and then charged needed to be registered. In later cases, the courts have held that if property is mixed during a manufacturing process so that it is no longer identifiable, or if it is sold onto a buyer, then the retention of title clause ceases to have effect. If the property is something that can be mixed (such as oil) and the clause prohibits this, then the seller may retain a percentage share of the mixture as a tenant in common. But if the clause purports to retain title over no more than a part of the property, Re Bond Worth Ltd held that the clause must take effect in equity, and so requires registration. The present requirements in the Companies Act 2006 section 860 continue not to explicitly cover retention of title clauses, in contrast to the registration requirements in the US Uniform Commercial Code article 9. This requires that anything with the same effect as a security interest requires registration, and so covers retention of title provision.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} {{to a decline in}} A330-300 sales, increased market penetration by the Boeing 767-300ER, and airline requests for increased range and smaller aircraft, Airbus developed the Airbus A330-200. Known as the A329 and A330M10 during development, the A330-200 would offer nine per cent lower operating costs than the Boeing 767-300ER. The plane was aimed at the [...] sector, where Airbus predicted demand for 800 aircraft between 1995 and 2015. The project, with US$450million in expected development costs, was approved by the Airbus <b>Industrie</b> Supervisory Board on 24 November 1995.|$|E

500|$|The Airbus A318 {{project had}} {{its origins in}} the {{collaboration}} among Chinese, Singaporean and European manufacturers. In May 1997, during the visit of French President Jacques Chirac to China, Aviation Industries of China (AVIC), Singapore Technologies Aerospace (STAe), Airbus and Alenia signed a framework agreement that outlined the development of aircraft in the 100-seat range. The AE31X programme, as it was tentatively dubbed, besides being a global industrial programme and was would have significantly deepened Sino-European commercial ties. With development costs estimated to be upwards of $2 billion, AVIC would have a 46 {{percent stake in the}} project, STAe 15 percent, and Airbus <b>Industrie</b> Asia 39 percent, the latter of which comprised Airbus and Alenia. Final assembly would have taken place in China.|$|E
500|$|With {{necessary}} funding available, the Airbus Supervisory Board {{approved the}} development of the A330 and A340 with potential customers on 27 January 1986. Its chairman Franz Josef Strauß stated afterwards that [...] "Airbus <b>Industrie</b> is now in a position to finalise the detailed technical definition of the TA9, which is now officially designated the A330, and the TA11, now called the A340, with potential launch customer airlines, and to discuss with them the terms and conditions for launch commitments". The designations were originally reversed and were switched so the quad-jet airliner would have a [...] "4" [...] in its name. Airbus hoped for five airlines to sign for both the A330 and A340, and on 12 May sent sale proposals to the most likely candidates, including Lufthansa and Swissair.|$|E

2500|$|Airbus <b>Industrie</b> was {{formally}} {{established as a}} Groupement d'Intérêt Économique (Economic Interest Group or GIE) on 18 December 1970. It had been formed by a government initiative between France, West Germany and the UK that originated in 1967. Its initial shareholders were the French company Aérospatiale and the West German company Deutsche Airbus, each owning a 50% share. The name [...] "Airbus" [...] was taken from a non-proprietary term used by the airline industry in the 1960s {{to refer to a}} commercial aircraft of a certain size and range, for this term was acceptable to the French linguistically. Aérospatiale and Deutsche Airbus each took a 36.5% share of production work, Hawker Siddeley 20% and the Dutch company Fokker-VFW 7%. Each company would deliver its sections as fully equipped, ready-to-fly items. In October 1971 the Spanish company CASA acquired a 4.2% share of Airbus <b>Industrie,</b> with Aérospatiale and Deutsche Airbus reducing their stakes to 47.9%. In January 1979 British Aerospace, which had absorbed Hawker Siddeley in 1977, acquired a 20% share of Airbus <b>Industrie.</b> The majority shareholders reduced their shares to 37.9%, while CASA retained its 4.2%.|$|E

2500|$|While many European {{aircraft}} were innovative, {{even the}} most successful had small production runs.
