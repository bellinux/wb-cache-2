In {{addition}} to continuous functions and smooth functions generally, there are maps with special properties. In geometric topology a basic type are embeddings, of which knot theory is a central example, and generalizations such as immersions, submersions, covering spaces, and ramified covering spaces.|$|E
25|$|Experiments {{made with}} the {{secretion}} of the parotid gland of Rhabdophis and Zamenis have shown that even aglyphous snakes are not entirely devoid of venom, and point {{to the conclusion that}} the physiological difference between so-called harmless and venomous snakes is only one of degree, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> various steps in the transformation of an ordinary parotid gland into a venom gland or of a solid tooth into a tubular or grooved fang.|$|E
25|$|I do {{not think}} that this is {{impossible}} or even difficult. There are genius women <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> genius men. Ingenuity is not a monopoly for men. It is not in vain that the Holy Quran tells us the story of a woman who led men wisely and bravely and made her people fare the best end: it is the Queen of Sheba, whose story with Solomon is told in Surat Al Naml. I have observed in the University of Qatar that girls make better students than boys.|$|E

25|$|It {{is quite}} common for {{saturation}} divers to need to work over a range of depths while the saturation system can only maintain one or two storage depths at any given time. A change of depth from storage depth is known as an excursion, and divers can make excursions within limits without incurring a decompression obligation, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no-decompression limits for surface oriented diving. Excursions may be upward or downward from the storage depth, and the allowed depth change may be the same in both directions, or sometimes slightly less upward than downward. Excursion limits are generally based on a 6 to 8 hour time limit, as this is the standard time limit for a diving shift.|$|E
25|$|Whereas roundarm and overarm {{were highly}} {{controversial}} and {{were introduced in}} the face of fierce opposition, {{there is nothing in the}} historical records which precisely dates the introduction of pitching and nothing which indicates that it was controversial. It has been suggested that the change effectively created a different code of cricket, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> now two different codes of rugby football, though in cricket the new completely superseded the old. The two eras are bridged by the career (c.1749 to c.1774) of John Frame, one of the game's first great bowlers, who played with pioneers like Thomas Waymark, Richard Newland and Robert Colchin at the beginning of his career and with pre-modernists like John Small and Lumpy Stevens at the end.|$|E
25|$|Kindergartens (幼稚園 yōchien), {{predominantly}} {{staffed by}} young female junior college graduates, are supervised by the Ministry of Education, {{but are not}} part of the official education system. The 58% of kindergartens that are private accounted for 77% of all children enrolled. In addition to kindergartens, there exists a well-developed system of government-supervised day-care centers (保育園 hoikuen), supervised by the Ministry of Labor. Whereas kindergartens follow educational aims, preschools are predominantly concerned with providing care for infants and toddlers. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> public and private kindergartens, there are both public and privately run preschools. Together, these two kinds of institutions enroll well over 90 percent of all preschool-age children prior to their entrance into the formal system at first grade. The Ministry of Education's 1990 Course of Study for Preschools, which applies to both kinds of institutions, covers such areas as human relationships, health, environment, language, and expression. Starting from March 2008 the new revision of curriculum guidelines for kindergartens as well as for preschools came into effect.|$|E

5000|$|Thinking {{about such}} {{matrices}} {{can be useful}} in one way, though: they highlight the fact that given any objects [...] and [...] in an additive category, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> exactly one morphism from [...] to 0 (<b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> exactly one 0-by-1 matrix with entries in [...] ) and exactly one morphism from 0 to [...] (<b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> exactly one 1-by-0 matrix with entries in [...] ) - this is just what it means to say that 0 is a zero object. Furthermore, the zero morphism from [...] to [...] is the composition of these morphisms, as can be calculated by multiplying the degenerate matrices.|$|R

500|$|A {{transition}} into traditional power is also possible. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> {{two kinds of}} traditional power — the priestly and the kingly — {{there are two kinds}} of revolutionary power, namely, the [...] "soldier of fortune" [...] and [...] "the divine conqueror". Russell classes Benito Mussolini and Napoleon Bonaparte as soldiers of fortune, and Adolf Hitler, Oliver Cromwell, and Vladimir Lenin as divine conquerors (Russell 1938:12). Nonetheless, the traditional forms bear only an imperfect relationship, if any, to the revolutionary forms.|$|E

500|$|There {{are many}} more {{regional}} styles of contemporary music {{that have yet to}} achieve the level of national recognition attained by salegy and tsapika <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> many nationally and internationally acclaimed musicians who draw upon the musical traditions of the coastal regions in their compositions. [...] Of note are Hazolahy (a largely acoustic roots band from the Southeast that plays mangaliba), D'Gary (an acclaimed acoustic guitarist from the inland South near Betroka), and Toto Mwandjani (who popularized Congolese ndombolo-style guitar, and whose band performs a fusion of Central/East African and Malagasy dance styles).|$|E
500|$|Ludwig Wittgenstein {{proposed}} a calculus theory of language, which maintained that all language should be analysable {{in a uniform}} way. Later in his life he rejected this theory, and instead {{proposed a}}n alternative language-game analogy. He likened the differences in languages to the differences in games, arguing that <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> many different games, each with different rules, so {{there are many different}} kinds of language. Wittgenstein argued that different forms of language have different rules which determine what makes a proposition meaningful; outside of its language-game, a proposition is meaningless. He believed that the meaning of a proposition depends on its context and the rules of that context. Wittgenstein presented a language game as a situation in which certain kinds of language are used. He provided some examples of language games: [...] "Asking, thanking, greeting, cursing, praying".|$|E
