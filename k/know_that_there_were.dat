Having entered the variety theatre the {{visitors}} {{found themselves in}} a large oblong space with a small stage and a row of boxes running along the three walls. We have no specific information about the décor, the evidence is scarce. We only <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> metal columns and many lamps of various colours in the house, the contemporaries also mention the glass floor with inbuilt lights.|$|E
2500|$|Breault and I {{separated}} {{to pound}} {{on each of}} the boat’s sides. In this way, the rescuers would <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> two of us. Breault played a kind of tune with his hammer, indicating to the diver that we were in good shape and cheerful. Neither of us knew Morse Code. We [...] had no food or water, and only a flashlight. We were confident we could stay alive for forty-eight hours. The high pressure and foul air gave us severe headaches. We did very little moving or talking; it excited our hearts too much. We heard scraping on the hull for hours. A couple of times we felt the O-5 being lifted, and then we got tossed roughly when the slings broke. We knew they were hard after us. This buoyed our hopes [...] for rescue tremendously. Finally, the sub began to be tilted upward slowly. We felt we would escape this time, but it seemed like forever. The last 20 minutes were unbearable. We heard our comrades walking on deck. Breault opened the hatch and we could see daylight. [...] We were saved!!! ...|$|E
2500|$|Burke's public {{coming out}} {{was met with}} wide support from the press and fans, with the ESPN {{interview}} garnering praise from the hockey world. He received hundreds of emails and letters of support from gay athletes from across the continent. [...] The news of his father's acceptance of his sexual orientation also earned Brian Burke praise from press and fans {{inside and outside the}} hockey world. The news further launched Brendan into advocacy, speaking about homophobia in hockey and encouraging discussion on the challenges faced by gay athletes in hockey and mainstream sports in general. In a later TSN interview, Burke stated that he hoped that telling his story would allow gay athletes and pro sports workers to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> supportive, safe environments for them and would encourage them to step forward as well. Toronto's Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) began using Burke's coming-out story as a teaching tool, stating that the story could [...] "change so many families across Canada, particularly because so many young boys are expected to grow up playing with a hockey stick and make their dads happy." [...] His coming-out story gained further attention from a large variety of news outlets in the days that followed. Interest in Brendan's story was attributed to both his relation to his father and [...] "hockey's sometimes homophobic culture." ...|$|E

60|$|I did {{not even}} <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> any better {{conditions}} to escape to, but I was {{more than willing to}} take my chances among people fashioned after my own mold rather than to remain longer among the hideous and bloodthirsty green men of Mars. But where to go, and how, was as much of a puzzle to me as the age-old search for the spring of eternal life has been to earthly men since the beginning of time.|$|E
60|$|The Indian listened gravely, and {{it seemed}} to satisfy his longings on the subject, to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> things in nature that are incomprehensible. As for the Chainbearer, I thought that he changed the {{discourse}} a little suddenly on account of these very incomprehensible things in nature; for it is certain he broke off on another theme, in a way to alter all the ideas of his companions, let them be on their heads or their heels.|$|E

60|$|This was vague, but {{it seemed}} to Sewell that there could be only one meaning to it. What he had feared to lose was not yet beyond his reach.

Just then her craving for influence was irresistible; but she swept away from the topic with a swift smile expressive only of the indifference which of all the feelings that she could show he most shrank from.|$|E
60|$|In still earlier days, {{before the}} {{advantages}} of fire were understood, our good grandmothers who sinned were admonished by water--they were drowned; but in the reign of Henry III a woman was hanged--without strangulation, apparently, for after a whole day of it she was cut down and pardoned. Sorceresses and unfaithful wives were smothered in mud, as also were unfaithful wives among the ancient Burgundians. The punishment of unfaithful husbands is not of record; we only <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no austerely virtuous editors to direct the finger of public scorn their way.|$|E

Glancing over his shoulder {{a moment or two}} later, he saw the men silhouetted black against the light as they stood in the doorway, and swung into faster stride. He felt he had nothing to fear from them, but their hints had been unpleasantly suggestive.|$|E
