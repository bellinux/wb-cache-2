25|$|Bankruptcy <b>fraudulent</b> <b>transfer</b> law {{is similar}} in {{practice}} to non-bankruptcy <b>fraudulent</b> <b>transfer</b> law. Some terms, however, are more generous in bankruptcy than they are otherwise. For instance, {{the statute of limitations}} within bankruptcy is two years as opposed to a shorter time frame in some non-bankruptcy contexts. Generally a <b>fraudulent</b> <b>transfer</b> action operates {{in much the same way}} as a preference avoidance. <b>Fraudulent</b> <b>transfer</b> actions, however, sometimes require a showing of intent to shelter the property from a creditor.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{conversion}} of nonexempt assets into exempt assets {{on the eve}} of bankruptcy would not be indicia of fraud per se. However, depending on the amount of the exemption and the circumstances surrounding the conversion, a court may find the conversion to be a <b>fraudulent</b> <b>transfer.</b> This is especially true when the conversion amounts to nothing more than a temporary arrangement. The cases that held a {{conversion of}} nonexempt into exempt assets to be a <b>fraudulent</b> <b>transfer</b> tend to focus on the existence of an independent reason for the conversion. For example, if a debtor purchased a residence protected by a homestead exemption with the intent to reside in such residence that would be an allowable conversion into nonexempt property. But where the debtor purchased the residence with all of their available funds, leaving no money to live off, that presumed that the conversion was temporary, indicating a <b>fraudulent</b> <b>transfer.</b> The courts look at the timing of the transfer as the most important factor.|$|E
25|$|The {{inability}} to repay debt in an LBO {{can be caused}} by initial overpricing of the target firm and/or its assets. Over-optimistic forecasts of the revenues of the target company may also lead to financial distress after acquisition. Some courts have found that in certain situations, LBO debt constitutes a <b>fraudulent</b> <b>transfer</b> under U.S. insolvency law if it is determined to be the cause of the acquired firm's failure.|$|E

25|$|The strong arm {{avoidance}} power {{stems from}} 11 U.S.C. § 544 and permits the trustee {{to exercise the}} rights that a debtor {{in the same situation}} would have under the relevant state law. Specifically, § 544(a) grants the trustee the rights of avoidance of (1) a judicial lien creditor, (2) an unsatisfied lien creditor, and (3) a bona fide purchaser of real property. In practice these avoidance powers often overlap with preference and <b>fraudulent</b> <b>transfer</b> avoidance powers.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, the Bankruptcy Code {{includes}} a so-called [...] "safe harbor" [...] provision, preventing bankruptcy trustees from recovering settlement {{payments to the}} bought-out shareholders. In 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that such settlement payments could not be avoided, irrespective of whether they occurred in an LBO of a public or private company.

2500|$|The {{outcome of}} {{litigation}} attacking a leveraged buyout as a <b>fraudulent</b> <b>transfer</b> will generally {{turn on the}} financial condition of the target {{at the time of}} the transaction – that is, whether the risk of failure was substantial and known {{at the time of the}} LBO, or whether subsequent unforeseeable events led to the failure. The analysis historically depended on [...] "dueling" [...] expert witnesses and was notoriously subjective, expensive, and unpredictable. [...] However, courts are increasingly turning toward more objective, market-based measures.|$|E

50|$|Often <b>fraudulent</b> <b>transfers</b> {{occur in}} {{connection}} with leveraged buyouts (LBOs), where the management/owners of a failing corporation will cause the corporation to borrow on its assets and use the loan proceeds to purchase the management/owner's stock at highly inflated prices. The creditors of the corporation will then often {{have little or no}} unencumbered assets left upon which to collect their debts. LBOs can be either intentional or constructive <b>fraudulent</b> <b>transfers,</b> or both, depending on how obviously the corporation is financially impaired when the transaction is completed.|$|R

A secured creditor or group of secured creditors frequently may encourage the company's senior management to pursue this liquidation mechanism. Secured creditor(s) may encourage this type of action to relieve themselves of the legal costs and risks associated with the foreclosure and sale of its collateral. One specific risk a secured creditor wants to avoid is preference or the perception of preference in the liquidation process (see <b>fraudulent</b> <b>transfer).</b>|$|E

5000|$|There are {{two kinds}} of <b>fraudulent</b> <b>transfer.</b> The archetypal example is the {{intentional}} <b>fraudulent</b> <b>transfer.</b> This is a transfer of property made by a debtor with intent to defraud, hinder, or delay his or her creditors. The second is a constructive <b>fraudulent</b> <b>transfer.</b> Generally, this occurs when a debtor transfers property without receiving [...] "reasonably equivalent value" [...] in exchange for the transfer if the debtor is insolvent {{at the time of the}} transfer or becomes insolvent or is left with unreasonably small capital to continue in business as a result of the transfer. Unlike the intentional <b>fraudulent</b> <b>transfer,</b> no intention to defraud is necessary.|$|E

5000|$|Creditors {{have several}} tools to {{overcome}} the laws that provide asset protection. First, there are federal and state <b>fraudulent</b> <b>transfer</b> laws. Today there are two bodies of <b>fraudulent</b> <b>transfer</b> law: the Bankruptcy Code and state <b>fraudulent</b> <b>transfer</b> statutes. Most states have adopted Uniform <b>Fraudulent</b> <b>Transfer</b> Act which defines what constitutes a <b>fraudulent</b> <b>transfer.</b> The UFTA and the Bankruptcy Code both provide that a transfer made by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor if the debtor made the transfer with the [...] "actual intention to hinder, delay or defraud" [...] any creditor of the debtor. While UFTA applies clearly to present creditors, the distinction between a future creditor and a future potential creditor is not as clear. The UFTA is commonly held to apply only to future creditors and not to future potential creditors (those whose claim arises after the transfer, {{but there was no}} foreseeable connection between the creditor and the debtor {{at the time of the}} transfer).|$|E
