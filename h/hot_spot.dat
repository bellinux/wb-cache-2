40|$|Objectives Using {{violent crime}} data from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania we {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} an “early warning system” (EWS) for starting/stopping police deployments to <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> for crime prevention. We show that (1) even the <b>hottest</b> chronic <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> are dynamic with months “on” and “off” and (2) temporary <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> are also targets for prevention. We compare the performance of EWS to constant deployment at chronic <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> Methods We estimate chronic <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> using kernel density smoothing. We use simple methods for implementing EWS rules for detecting flare-ups, predicting persistence of flare-ups, and stopping deployments. Using 2000 – 2010 data we run computational experiments varying size of <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> and rule thresholds to tune EWS. Results Tradeoff curves with crimes exposed to prevention efforts versus area of the city under prevention workload show that static and dynamic deployments have nearly the same efficiency. Different, however, is land-use distribution. While chronic <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> tend to be in or adjacent to commercial areas, dynamic <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> have significantly more and widely-scattered residential locations. We argue that dynamic <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> thus have higher potential for reducing fear of crime and providing responsive police services to neighborhoods. Conclusions Even though police resources are “wasted” during “off” months by constant deployment to chronic <b>hot</b> <b>spots,</b> a dynamic system of deployment with simple methods cannot improve the efficiency of crime prevention. EWS comparably “wastes” resources because of false positives for hot-spot persistence and waiting to confirm hot-spot extinguishment. Nevertheless, EWS is more responsive to residential crim...|$|R

5|$|Perhaps no American neo-noirs better {{reflect the}} classic noir A-movie-with-a-B-movie-soul {{than those of}} director-writer Quentin Tarantino; neo-noirs of his such as Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction (1994) display a relentlessly self-reflexive, {{sometimes}} tongue-in-cheek sensibility, similar {{to the work of}} the New Wave directors and the Coens. Other films from the era readily identifiable as neo-noir (some retro, some more au courant) include director John Dahl's Kill Me Again (1989), Red Rock West (1992), The Last Seduction (1993), as well as Gus van Sant's To Die For (1995), and Andrew Davis's A Perfect Murder (1998); four adaptations of novels by Jim Thompson—The Kill-Off (1989), After Dark, My Sweet (1990), The Grifters (1990), and the remake of The Getaway (1994); and many more, including adaptations of the work of other major noir fiction writers: The <b>Hot</b> <b>Spot</b> (1990), from Hell Hath No Fury, by Charles Williams; Miami Blues (1990), from the novel by Charles Willeford; and Out of Sight (1998), from the novel by Elmore Leonard. Several films by director-writer David Mamet involve noir elements: House of Games (1987), Homicide (1991), The Spanish Prisoner (1997), and Heist (2001). On television, Remington Steele (1982–87) and Moonlighting (1985–89) paid homage to classic noir while demonstrating an unusual appreciation of the sense of humor often found in the original cycle. Between 1983 and 1989, Mickey Spillane's hardboiled private eye Mike Hammer was played with wry gusto by Stacy Keach in a series and several stand-alone television films (an unsuccessful revival followed in 1997–98). The British miniseries The Singing Detective (1986), written by Dennis Potter, {{tells the story of a}} mystery writer named Philip Marlow; widely considered one of the finest neo-noirs in any medium, some critics rank it among the greatest television productions of all time.|$|E

40|$|The fine-scale {{distribution}} of meiotic recombination {{events in the}} human genome can be inferred from patterns of haplotype diversity in human populations but directly studied only by high-resolution sperm typing. Both approaches indicate that crossovers are heavily clustered into narrow recombination <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> But our direct understanding of hot-spot properties and distributions is largely limited to sperm typing in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). We now describe the analysis of an unremarkable 206 -kb region on human chromosome 1, which identified localized regions of linkage disequilibrium breakdown that mark the locations of sperm crossover <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> The distribution, intensity and morphology of these <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> are markedly {{similar to those in}} the MHC. But we also accidentally detected additional <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> in regions of strong association. Coalescent analysis of genotype data detected most of the <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> but showed significant differences between sperm crossover frequencies and historical recombination rates. This raises the possibility that some <b>hot</b> <b>spots,</b> particularly those in regions of strong association, may have evolved very recently and not left their full imprint on haplotype diversity.

Most of these <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> were locations with frequent deer-vehicle collisions, although some were crossing locations for deer and elk that did not have frequent animal-vehicle collisions. Some <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> were identified for non-focal species, including northwestern pond turtle, western painted turtle, coyote, bobcat, black bear, and beaver. <b>Hot</b> <b>spots</b> generally were associated with topographic features that directed animals towards highways, the presence of habitat adjacent to highways, or food resources that attracted animals. Six <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> were considered high priority. The expert-opinion approach employed for this analysis was effective in rapidly assessing many miles of state-maintained highway for the presence of wildlife <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> and may prove useful in addressing conflicts between wildlife and highways in other locales or on a statewide basis.

40|$|Abstract Background Systematic {{mutagenesis}} {{studies have}} shown that only a few interface residues termed <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> contribute significantly to the binding free energy of protein-protein interactions. Therefore, <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> prediction becomes increasingly important for well understanding the essence of proteins interactions and helping narrow down the search space for drug design. Currently many computational methods have been developed by proposing different features. However comparative assessment of these features and furthermore effective and accurate methods are still in pressing need. Results In this study, we first comprehensively collect the features to discriminate <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> and non-hot spots and analyze their distributions. We find that <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> have lower relASA and larger relative change in ASA, suggesting <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> tend to be protected from bulk solvent. In addition, <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> have more contacts including hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and atomic contacts, which favor complexes formation. Interestingly, we find that conservation score and sequence entropy are not significantly different between <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> and non-hot spots in Ab+ dataset (all complexes). While in Ab- dataset (antigen-antibody complexes are excluded), there are significant differences in two features between hot pots and non-hot spots. Secondly, we explore the predictive ability for each feature and the combinations of features by support vector machines (SVMs). The results indicate that sequence-based feature outperforms other combinations of features with reasonable accuracy, with a precision of 0. 69, a recall of 0. 68, an F 1 score of 0. 68, and an AUC of 0. 68 on independent test set. Compared with other machine learning methods and two energy-based approaches, our approach achieves the best performance. Moreover, we demonstrate the applicability of our method to predict <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> of two protein complexes. Conclusion Experimental results show that support vector machine classifiers are quite effective in predicting <b>hot</b> <b>spots</b> based on sequence features. <b>Hot</b> <b>spots</b> cannot be fully predicted through simple analysis based on physicochemical characteristics, but {{there is reason to believe}} that integration of features and machine learning methods can remarkably improve the predictive performance for <b>hot</b> <b>spots.</b> </p...|$|R
