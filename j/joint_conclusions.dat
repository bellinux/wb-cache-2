(Laughter and interruption.) 'I need not remind this audience that, though Professor Summerlee, {{as the head of the}} Committee of Investigation, has been put up to speak to-night, still it is I who am the real prime mover in this business, and that it is mainly to me that any successful result must be ascribed.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Nail patella {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} autosomal dominant hereditary condition, with an incidence of 22 per million in the United Kingdom. The syndrome’s most common features include iliac horns, hypoplastic patella and nail dysplasia. Case presentation We report {{the case of a}} 26 -year-old Caucasian man with nail patella syndrome who sustained a fracture of his right hypoplastic patella after a fall. His right knee became swollen and he was unable to extend against gravity immediately post fall. Radiographs revealed a fracture of the lower pole of his right patella with associated complete disruption of the extensor mechanism of the knee. He underwent operative fixation and his post operative course was uneventful. He was further treated post operatively with a full knee cast and graded immobilization. At six months he had regained the full range of motion at the knee <b>joint.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> To the best of our knowledge, this is the only case report in the literature describing a patella fracture in an individual with nail patella syndrome. We hypothesize that given the extent of pre-existing knee joint impairment in these individuals, functional outcome may be inferior, suggesting the need for more frequent follow-up. </p...|$|E

40|$|Purpose Clinical {{observation}} {{has led to}} {{the discovery}} of a distinct anatomic septum from the extensor tendon to the skin at the distal phalanx that appears to limit the proximal spread of infection from the dorsum of the distal phalanx. This study employed histology and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to identify this anatomic structure {{at the level of the}} distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint. Methods We used high-resolution (16. 4 -T) MRI to image and section 10 cadaveric fingers (9 female, 1 male) from both left and right hands. Once imaged, we made histologic sections using hematoxylin and eosin, or Van Gieson 2 ̆ 7 s stain, and examined them microscopically for concordant findings. Results In all 10 scans, the proposed septum was visualized using MRI with histologic confirmation. It was observed to extend from the skin creases overlying the dorsal aspect of the DIP,joint to the extensor tendon. It is composed of collagen bundles arranged in a variable network that adhere extensor tendon to skin at the DIP <b>joint.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> Clinical observations proposed the existence of a distinct septum between extensor tendon and skin at the level of the DIP joint. We confirmed this structure to be a collagen septum by MRI and histology. This previously undescribed structure is called the dorsal septum. (J Hand Surg 2009; 34 A: 467 - 473.

40|$|Abstract Background Estrogen {{is known}} to play role in {{temporomandibular}} joint (TMJ) disorders and estrogen effects can be mediated by estrogen receptor (ER) alpha present in the TMJ. Cells expressing the estrogen receptor ERalpha {{are present in the}} temporomandibular joint (TMJ) but changes in expression due to estrogen and inflammation have not been characterized. In this study, ERalpha protein content and the number of cells expressing ERalpha was measured in 17 beta-estradiol-treated rats after inflammation was induced in the TMJ. Methods Sixteen ovariectomized female rats were divided into two groups such that one group received 17 beta estradiol (E 2) and the other was given vehicle (VEH). Groups were then subdivided further, one received injections of saline and the other received Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) within the superior joint space of the TMJ. Thus the four groups include no E 2 /saline, E 2 /saline, no E 2 /CFA and E 2 /CFA. After treatment, the rats were sacrificed, and the TMJ anterior, disc, retrodiscal and synovial tissues were analyzed by western blot and immunocytochemistry. Positive stained cells were counted using a Nikon epifluorescent microscope. Results The western blot showed that ERalpha protein significantly decreased with inflammation. The number of ERalpha-positive cells in the TMJ was not affected by inflammation or 17 beta-estradiol with exception of the retrodiscal tissue. In the retrodiscal tissue 17 beta-estradiol significantly decreased the number of ERalpha-positive cells but only in a non-inflamed <b>joint.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> In conclusion, inflammation and 17 beta-estradiol can modulate ERalpha expression in the TMJ but the effects are tissue specific. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Wearing {{a harness}} during {{treadmill}} walking ensures the subject's safety and is {{common practice in}} biomedical engineering research. However, {{the extent to which}} such practice influences gait is unknown. This study investigated harness-related changes in gait patterns, as evaluated from lower extremity kinematics during treadmill walking. Findings Healthy subjects (n = 10) walked on a treadmill at their preferred speed for 3 minutes with and without wearing a harness (LiteGait ®, Mobility Research, Inc.). In the former condition, no weight support was provided to the subjects. Lower extremity kinematics was assessed in the sagittal plane from the mean (mean RoM), standard deviation (SD RoM) and coefficient of variation (CoV RoM) of the hip, knee, and ankle ranges of motion (RoM), {{as well as from the}} sample entropy (SampEn) and the largest Lyapunov exponent (LyE) of the joints' angles. Wearing the harness increased the mean RoM of the hip, the SD RoM and the CoV RoM of the knee, and the SampEn and the LyE of the ankle. In particular, the harness effect sizes for both the SampEn and the LyE of the ankle were large, likely reflecting a meaningful decline in the neuromuscular stabilizing control of this <b>joint.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> Wearing a harness during treadmill walking marginally influences lower extremity kinematics, resulting in more or less subtle changes in certain kinematic variables. However, in cases where differences in gait patterns would be expressed through modifications in these variables, having subjects walk with a harness may mask or reinforce such differences. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction In {{patients}} who have undergone a total joint replacement, any mass occurring in or adjacent to the joint needs thorough investigation and a wear debris-induced cyst should be suspected. Case presentation An 81 -year-old man presented with a painful and enlarging mass at the popliteal fossa and calf of his right knee. He had had a total right knee replacement seven years previously. Plain radiographs showed narrowing of the medial compartment. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a cystic lesion at the postero-medial aspect of the knee joint mimicking popliteal cyst or soft tissue sarcoma. Fine needle aspiration was non-diagnostic. A core-needle biopsy showed metallosis. Intraoperative findings revealed massive metallosis related to extensive polyethylene wear, delamination and deformation. Revision knee and patella arthroplasty was carried out after a thorough debridement of the knee <b>joint.</b> <b>Conclusion</b> Long-term follow-up is critical for patients with total joint replacement for early detection of occult polyethylene wear and prosthesis loosening. In these cases, revision arthroplasty may provide a satisfactory knee function. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Pelvic digit {{is a rare}} {{congenital}} anomaly where bone develops in the soft tissue adjacent to normal skeletal bone. The condition is benign and is usually discovered accidentally. On a plain radiography, pelvic digit typically appears as a rib- or phalanx-like bone structure with a clear cortex and medulla related to the pelvis, often with a pseudoarticulation at its base. Case presentation We present {{the case of a}} 40 -year-old Caucasian man who presented with chronic pain and tenderness over his right hip together with functional impairment in abduction and external rotation.

40|$|OBJECTIVES AND BACKGROUND The {{purpose of}} this study is to provide a simple, cost-effective, {{reproducible}} technology that is able to regenerate durable hyaline cartilage. Traumas and sports along with different diseases such as obesity or gradual degeneration over time of the joint surface determine cartilage defects resulting in pain and dysfunctionality. MATERIALS AND METHODS Since 2011 a number of 183 pacients were treated using Agili-C, out of which 40 pacients were operated in the IInd Clinic of Orthopaedics of the Timișoara Emergency County Hospital. The implant is a biphasic, porous, resorbable tissue regeneration scaffold used in the treatment of osteochondral defects. The surgical procedure is performed through minimal arthrotomy, with a good exposure of the cartilage defect. The implant is inserted so that the articular surface of the implant is parallel with the surrounding healthy cartilage. When in place, it facilitates vascularization thus allowing tissue formation to commence from the periphery towards the center of the defect. RESULTS Until now, results are promising, showing obvious improvements in pain and function in both degenerative and post-traumatic joint lesions in the knee, ankle and first MP <b>joint.</b> <b>CONCLUSIONS</b> Agili-C is a cell free, single stage, off the shelf implant that will hopefully meet market demands and become a reliable procedure in joint repair surgery in the future.

40|$|Objective Delayed {{gadolinium}} enhanced MRI of cartilage (dGEMRIC) facilitates non-invasive {{evaluation of}} the glycosaminoglycan content in articular cartilage. The primary {{aim of this study}} was to show that the dGEMRIC technique is able to monitor cartilage repair following regenerative cartilage treatment. Design Thirty-one patients with a focal cartilage lesion underwent a dGEMRIC scan prior to cartilage repair surgery and at 3 and 12 months follow-up. At similar time points clinical improvement was monitored using the KOOS and Lysholm questionnaires. Per MRI scan several regions-of-interest (ROI) were defined for different locations in the joint. The dGEMRIC index (T 1 gd) was calculated for each ROI. RMANOVA analysis was used to evaluate improvement in clinical scores and MRI T 1 gd over time. Also regression analysis was performed to show the influence of local repair on cartilage quality at distant locations in the knee. Results Clinical scores and the dGEMRIC T 1 gd per ROI showed a statistically significant improvement (p< 0. 01), from baseline, at 12 months follow-up. Also, improvement from baseline in T 1 gd of the ROI defining the treated cartilage defect showed a direct relationship (p< 0. 007) to the improvement of the T 1 gd of ROI at other locations in the <b>joint.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> The dGEMRIC MRI protocol is a useful method to evaluate cartilage repair. In addition, local cartilage repair influenced the cartilage quality at other location in the joint.

40|$|Background Locking plates {{have become}} a {{commonly}} used fixation device in the operative treatment of three- and four-part proximal humerus fractures. Examining function in patients treated nonoperatively and operatively should help determine whether and when surgery is appropriate in these difficult-to-treat fractures. Questions/purposes We compared functional scores, ROM, and radiographs in patients with one-part proximal humerus fractures treated nonoperatively to those in patients with displaced three- and four-part proximal humerus fractures treated with open reduction and internal fixation using locking plates. Patients and Methods We retrospectively reviewed 142 patients with proximal humerus fractures treated with a standardized treatment algorithm over a 6 -year period. Three- and four-part fractures were treated surgically while one-part fractures were treated nonoperatively. Functional scores, ROM, and radiographs were used to evaluate out-comes. American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons and SF- 36 scores were obtained at 12 months. Of the 142 patients, 101 (51 with three- or four-part fractures and 50 with one-part fractures) had a minimum followup of 12 months (average, 19 months; range, 12 – 64 months). Results The fractures united in all patients. At 1 year, the patients with one-part fractures had better SF- 36 physical and mental scores and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores than the three- and four-part fractures. Both groups had similar shoulder ROM. Nine patients treated operatively had complications, four of which were related to screw penetration into the <b>joint.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> Patients with three- and four-part fractures should be advised of the likelihood of persistent functional impairment and a relatively higher risk of complications when treated operatively with locked plates.

Findings The proximal tibiofibular joint was analyzed in 30 patients, who reported knee pain after tibial nailing, and standard radiograph and computed tomography were performed to examine the proximal third of the tibia. Twenty patients (68. 9 %) presented the proximal screw crossing the proximal tibiofibular joint and 13 (44. 8 %) had already removed the nail and/or screw. Four patients (13. 7 %) reported complaint of knee pain. However, the screw did not reach the proximal tibiofibular joint.

40|$|International audienceWe use GPS, bathymetric/structural, and seismic data {{to define}} the pattern of present {{deformation}} along the northern half of the Azores plateau, where the Nubia-Eurasia plate boundary terminates at the axis of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). New and existing campaign GPS velocities from the Azores islands reveal extension oblique {{to a series of}} en échelon volcanic ridges occupied by Terceira, S. Jorge, Pico, and Faial islands. In a frame of reference defined by 69 continuous GPS stations on the Eurasia plate, Terceira Island moves 2 ± 1 mm/yr away from Eurasia, consistent with the islandʼs location within the Terceira Rift and plate boundary structure. The volcanic ridges south of the Terceira Rift move toward WSW at progressively faster rates, reaching a maximum of 3. 5 ± 0. 5 mm/yr (2 -σ) for the Pico/Faial volcanic ridge. The hypothesis that the Terceira Rift accommodates all Nubia-Eurasia plate motion is rejected at high confidence level based on the motions of sites on S. Jorge Island just west of Terceira Rift. All of the islands move relative to the Nubia plate, with Pico Island exhibiting the slowest motion, only 1 ± 0. 5 mm/yr (2 -σ). Detailed bathymetry from the interior of the hypothesized Azores microplate reveals faults that crosscut young MAR seafloor fabric. These observations and the GPS evidence for distributed deformation described above argue against the existence of a rigid or semi-rigid Azores microplate, and instead suggest that Nubia-Eurasia plate motion is accommodated by extension across a ∼ 140 -km-wide zone east of the MAR axis, most likely bounded to the north by the northern shoulder of the Terceira Rift. The MAR spreading rate along the western end of the Azores deformation zone (∼ 38. 5 °N- 39. 5 °N) is intermediate between the Eurasia-North America rate measured at 39. 5 °N and the Nubia-North America rate measured at 38. 5 °N, consistent with the <b>joint</b> <b>conclusions</b> that the Nubia-Eurasia boundary is broad where it intersects the MAR, and the Azores Triple Junction is diffuse rather than discrete...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Osteoarthritis (OA) is a ebilitating {{disease with}} poorly defined aetiology. Multiple signals are {{involved}} in directing the formation of cartilage during development and the vitamin A derivatives, the retinoids, figure prominently in embryonic cartilage formation. In the present study, we examined {{the expression of a}} retinoid-regulated gene in murine models of OA. Methods Mild and moderate forms of an OA-like degenerative disease were created in the mouse stifle joint by meniscotibial transection (MTX) and partial meniscectomy (PMX), respectively. Joint histopathology was scored using an Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) system and gene expression (Col 1 a 1, Col 10 a 1, Sox 9 and Crabp 2) in individual joints was determined using TaqMan quantitative PCR on RNA from microdissected articular knee cartilage. Results For MTX, there was {{a significant increase in the}} joint score at 10 weeks (n = 4, p 3 ̆c 0. 001) in comparison to sham surgeries. PMX surgery was slightly more severe and produced significant changes in joint score at six (n = 4, p 3 ̆c 0. 01), eight (n = 4, p 3 ̆c 0. 001) and 10 (n = 4, p 3 ̆c 0. 001) weeks. The expression of Col 1 a 1 was increased in both surgical models at two, four and six weeks post-surgery. In contrast, Col 10 a 1 and Sox 9 for the most part showed no significant difference in expression from two to six weeks post-surgery. Crabp 2 expression is induced upon activation of the retinoid signalling pathway. At two weeks after surgery in the MTX and PMX animals, Crabp 2 expression was increased about 18 -fold and about 10 -fold over the sham control, respectively. By 10 weeks, Crabp 2 expression was increased about three-fold (n = 7, not significant) in the MTX animals and about five-fold (n = 7, p 3 ̆c 0. 05) in the PMX animals in comparison to the contralateral control <b>joint.</b> <b>Conclusions</b> Together, these findings suggest that the retinoid signalling pathway is activated early in the osteoarthritic process and is sustained during the course of the disease...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE. To {{evaluate}} the operative findings and postoperative results of one-stage repair on patients with acromioclavicular joint dislocation complicated by rotator cuff tear. METHODS. Between 1992 and 1999, one-stage repair {{was performed on}} 5 patients with acromioclavicular joint dislocation complicated by rotator cuff tears. Modified Cadenat procedure for acromioclavicular joint dislocation, and McLaughlin procedure for rotator cuff tear, were performed on these patients. Postoperative results at the final examination were assessed according to the criteria for therapeutic effects on shoulder joint disorders of the Japanese Orthopaedic Association. RESULTS. There was partial-thickness cuff tear in one patient, and full-thickness cuff tear in the remaining 4 patients. In all patients, tears were located only in the supraspinatus tendon, and were medium or small ones with maximal diameter of 3 cm or less. After a mean follow-up period of 56 months (range, 36 - 79 months), all patients were assessed to have excellent results. No patient showed a good reduction of the acromio-clavicular <b>joint.</b> <b>CONCLUSION.</b> For patients successfully treated by one-stage repair, satisfactory results were obtained without pain or disturbance in activities of daily living...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction One of {{the primary}} {{functions}} of the proximal tibiofibular joint is slight rotation to accommodate rotational stress at the ankle. Proximal tibiofibular joint dislocation is a rare injury and accounts for less than 1 % of all knee injuries. This dislocation {{has been reported in}} patients who had been engaged in football, ballet dancing, equestrian jumping, parachuting and snowboarding. Case presentation A 20 -year-old man was injured whilst playing football. He felt a pop in the right knee and was subsequently unable to bear weight on it. The range of movement in his knee joint was limited. Anterior-posterior and lateral X-rays of the knee revealed anterolateral dislocation of the proximal tibiofibular joint. Comparison views confirmed the anterolateral dislocation. He had a failed manipulation under anaesthesia and the joint needed an open reduction in which the fibular head was levered back into place. Operative findings revealed a horizontal type of <b>joint.</b> <b>Conclusion</b> An exceedingly rare dislocation of a horizontal type of proximal tibiofibular joint was presented following a football injury. This dislocation was irreducible by a closed method. </p...|$|R
40|$|This article aims {{to discuss}} how the action {{research}} process can allow socially and historically constructed silences to be overcome. These kinds of silences prevent the emergence of dialogues necessary to the investigation mode. The necessary dialogues are built {{through the creation of}} a common participatory universe, and the construction of a consensual space between researchers and subjects of the practice, between those who are different and those who are the same. The article analyzes an action research project with women embroiderers in the suburbs of a large Brazilian city, directed at the formation of a working collective. Focusing on this experience, the authors discuss the strategies used to break the silence between the researcher and the group, considering the differences between researcher and group that could reinforce silences that already existed for participants. In a <b>joint</b> <b>conclusion,</b> the authors point out that action research can work as a critical instrument for breaking silence, allowing subjects to produce communicative processes that make it possible to overcome “resigned states” in order to transform their reality.

5000|$|A <b>joint</b> <b>conclusion</b> {{is that it}} is important, {{for both}} {{software}} vendors and users, that a clear separation between acceptable and unacceptable software behaviour is established. The reason for this is the subjective nature of many spyware programs included, which result in inconsistencies between different users beliefs, i.e. what one user regards as legitimate software could be regarded as a spyware by others. As the spyware concept came to include increasingly more types of programs, the term got hollowed out, resulting in several synonyms, such as trackware, evilware and badware, all negatively emotive. We therefore choose to introduce the term privacy-invasive software to encapsulate all such software. We believe this term to be more descriptive than other synonyms without having as negative connotation. Even if we use the word invasive to describe such software, we believe that an invasion of privacy can be both desired and beneficial for the user {{as long as it is}} fully transparent, e.g. when implementing specially user-tailored services or when including personalization features in software.|$|R
40|$|Objective. To study {{prevalence}} ofjoint complaints {{among children}} (0 - 17 years of age) in Bashkiria. Material and methods. Study sample {{was formed in}} 4 cities and 2 country regions where 51633 children aged 017 years live. Questionnaire constructed by the Institute of Rheumatology of RAMS and adapted to children age was used. 43907 (85 %) of children and/or their parents were evaluated. Results. Joint pain were revealed in 5478 (12, 5 %), joint swelling - in 761 (1, 7 %) children. Total 5520 (12, 6 %) children had arthralgia and/or <b>joint</b> swelling. <b>Conclusion.</b> <b>Joint</b> complaints are quite frequent in children (12, 6 %). According {{to the results of}} the I stage of the study a group of children for thorough clinical and instrumental examination was formed to reveal prevalence and structure of juvenile chronic arthritides...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Joint lesions occur {{widespread}} in the Danish sow population {{and they are the}} most frequent cause for euthanasia. Clinically, it is generally impossible to differentiate between various types of non-inflammatory joint lesions. Consequently, it is often necessary to perform a post mortem examination in order to diagnose these lesions. A study was performed in order to examine the relation of abnormal gait and posture in sows with specific joint lesions, and thereby obtaining a clinical diagnostic tool, to be used by farmers and veterinarians for the evaluation of sows with joint problems. Methods The gait, posture and lesions in elbow- and knee joints of 60 randomly selected sows from one herd were scored clinically and pathologically. Associations between the scorings were estimated. Results The variables 'fore- and hind legs turned out' and 'stiff in front and rear' were associated with lesions in the elbow joint, and the variables 'hind legs turned out' and 'stiff in rear' were associated with lesions in the knee <b>joint.</b> <b>Conclusion</b> It was shown that specified gait and posture variables reflected certain joint lesions. However, further studies are needed to strengthen and optimize the diagnostic tool. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective. Achyranthes aspera Linn. (AA) {{is used in}} {{folklore}} for {{the treatment}} of various inflammatory ailments and arthritis like conditions. Anti-inflammatory activity of saponin rich (SR) fraction of AA has been previously reported. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the antiarthritic effect of SR fraction of Achyranthes aspera in adjuvant-induced arthritic rats. Methods. Arthritis was assessed by arthritis score, paw volume, changes in tibiotarsal joint thickness, hyperalgesic parameters, and spleen and thymus index. Haematological, serum, biochemical, and inflammatory cytokine and in vivo antioxidant parameters were measured on the last day of the study. Results. SR fraction significantly suppressed paw swelling and arthritic score and improved the pain threshold in motility and stair climbing tests. There was a reversal in the levels of altered parameters, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and antioxidant parameters like superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione, malondialdehyde, and nitric oxide. SR fraction significantly decreased plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin- 6. Moreover, histopathology revealed a significant reduction in synovial hyperplasia, inflammatory cell infiltration, and bone destruction in the <b>joints.</b> <b>Conclusion.</b> These observations explain the therapeutic benefit of SR fraction of AA in suppressing the progression of adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats...|$|R

5000|$|Negotiations and persuasion {{are social}} {{conflicts}} {{can be understood}} in terms of CLT. When negotiating or trying to persuade someone, there are often major, high-level, considerations and minor, low-level, considerations. Major issues are aspects such as values, ideology, and overall beliefs. The major issues are often focused on to a greater extent when thinking about the distant future, or with high-level construals. Minor issues are more specific interests that are focused on when thinking about the near future, or low-level construals. [...] CLT and persuasive communications are connected and interrelated in many aspects. When looking at negotiations in relation to high-level construal, there were multiple findings that have shown a difference between the future and the present. When people are more temporally distant or personally distant from an outcome, {{they are less likely to}} come to an easy conclusion or compromise over minor objectives. More distance between the present and the time when the negotiations take place makes people more willing to come to a <b>joint</b> <b>conclusion</b> and achieve logrolling agreements that maximize the outcomes of both parties. Lastly, thinking more abstractly about the negotiation in general leads to more compromises and mutually beneficial agreements.|$|R
