5|$|At {{the start}} of the nineteenth century, the works of Sir Walter Scott were best-sellers in France. His novels {{captured}} the <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> flow of society, and he demonstrated the far-reaching impact of major historical changes. A slew of authors in France attempted to replicate Scott's success, but their works were isolated from one another and divorced from their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|David Lovering (born December 6, 1961) is an American {{musician}} and magician. He {{is best known}} as the drummer for the alternative rock band Pixies, which he joined in 1986. After the band's breakup in 1993, Lovering drummed with several other acts, including The Martinis, Cracker, Nitzer <b>Ebb</b> <b>and</b> Tanya Donelly. He also pursued a magic career as The Scientific Phenomenalist; performing scientific and physics-based experiments on stage. When the Pixies reunited in 2004, Lovering returned as the band's drummer.|$|E

5|$|As {{military}} governor, Johnson {{sought to}} eliminate rebel {{influence in the}} state. He demanded loyalty oaths from public officials, and shut down all newspapers owned by Confederate sympathizers. Much of eastern Tennessee remained in Confederate hands, and the <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> flow of war during 1862 sometimes brought Confederate control again close to Nashville. However, the Confederates allowed his wife and family {{to pass through the}} lines to join him. Johnson undertook the defense of Nashville as best he could, though the city was continually harassed by cavalry raids led by General Nathan Bedford Forrest. Relief from Union regulars did not come until William S. Rosecrans defeated the Confederates at Murfreesboro in early 1863. Much of eastern Tennessee was captured later that year.|$|E
5|$|Watchet {{developed}} as a town thanks to its closeness to the minerals within the Brendon Hills, and its access to the River Severn for onward shipping. Aside from local ships plying trade across the river, from 1564 onwards the port was used for import of salt and wine from France. In 1643 during the English Civil War, a Royalist ship was sent to Watchet to reinforce for the siege of Dunster Castle. Parliamentarian (Roundhead) Captain Popham ordered his troops into the sea with the tide on the <b>ebb,</b> <b>and</b> with the ship unable to move, attacked the ship with fire from their carbines. Taken by surprise and under heavy attack, the Royalist commander surrendered the ship, resulting in a ship technically at sea being captured by troops on horseback.|$|E
5|$|Charles' abdication had {{far-reaching}} {{consequences in}} imperial {{diplomatic relations with}} France and the Netherlands, particularly in his allotment of the Spanish kingdom to Philip. In France, the kings and their ministers grew increasingly uneasy about Habsburg encirclement and sought allies against Habsburg hegemony from among the border German territories; they were even prepared to ally {{with some of the}} Protestant kings. In the Netherlands, Philip's ascension in Spain raised particular problems; for the sake of harmony, order, and prosperity, Charles had not oppressed the Reformation as harshly there as did Philip, and Charles had even had tolerated a high level of local autonomy. An ardent Catholic and rigidly autocratic prince, Philip pursued an aggressive political, economic and religious policy toward the Dutch, resulting in their rebellion shortly after he became king. Philip's militant response meant the occupation of much of the upper provinces by troops of, or hired by, Habsburg Spain and the constant <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> flow of Spanish men and provisions over the Spanish road from northern Italy, through the Burgundian lands, into and from Flanders.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of his father's death in 1901, the family fortunes were at a low <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> Bruce went into the family business after leaving high school. The young Bruce was ambitious and determined to get an education. With loaned money, {{he moved to the}} United Kingdom with his mother and sister and enrolled in Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1902. He was a popular if average student, heavily involved in the athletic life of the college, including {{as a member of the}} Cambridge rowing crew that won the Boat Race in 1904. Rowing remained one of his great passions, and he continued to coach crews (including several for the Henley Royal Regatta) and write on the subject for much of his life. Ernest Bruce had remained in Australia to take charge of the family's business interests. In 1906, he lobbied the directors of the company to have his brother Stanley take over the chairmanship of Paterson, Laing and Bruce, and was ultimately successful. Despite being just 23, he proved an able chairman, and with Stanley in London managing the exporting and financial interests, and Ernest managing the importation and sales operations in Melbourne, the financial fortunes of the business and the family rapidly recovered. During these years, Bruce also trained and worked as a solicitor and then as a barrister in the London with the firm of Ashurst, Morris, Crisp & Co. His work for the firm took him to Mexico in 1908 and Colombia in 1912, which fostered an interest in international affairs.|$|E
25|$|In {{more complex}} situations, the main <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> flood flows do not dominate. Instead, the flow {{direction}} and magnitude trace an ellipse over a tidal cycle (on a polar plot) instead of along the <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> flood lines. In this case, analysis might proceed along pairs of directions, {{with the primary}} and secondary directions at right angles. An alternative is to treat the tidal flows as complex numbers, as each value has both a magnitude and a direction.|$|E

25|$|The {{dynamics}} of New Brunswick politics {{are different from}} those of other Canadian provinces. The lack of a dominant urban centre in the province means that the government has to be responsive to issues affecting all areas of the province. In addition, the presence of a large Francophone minority dictates that consensus politics is necessary, even when there is a majority government present. In this manner, the <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> flow of New Brunswick provincial politics parallels the federal stage.|$|E
25|$|A {{small number}} of {{closures}} of major industrial employers {{took place in the}} first half of the 20th century, due to the <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> flow of trade. Andrew's Gas Engine Works was taken over in 1905 by Richard Hornsby & Sons of Grantham, the business was transferred to Grantham and the Reddish works closed some time during the great depression following WWI. Cronin indicates that the works were still in operation in 1930. The Atlas wire rope works closed in 1927.|$|E

25|$|Various {{proposals}} for a fixed link across the Northumberland Strait {{can be traced}} {{as far back as}} the 1870s when the province's railway system was developed. Subsequent proposals arose during federal elections in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> flow of public support for a fixed link was indirectly tied to the varying levels of federal investment in ferry and steamship connections to the province over the years, finally culminating in a proposal in the mid-1980s which resulted in the current bridge being constructed.|$|E

Built in 1403 AD (810 AH) Timur is buried in the Gur-e Amir in Samarkand, under a fluted dome. The tomb employs a traditional Persian iwan as an entrance. The 1528 AD (935 AH) Tomb of Babur in Kabul is much more modest in comparison, with a simple cenotaph exposed to the sky, laid out in the centre of a walled garden.|$|E
25|$|Slightly paralleled by A. L. Rowse, {{author of}} Shakespeare's Sonnets: The Problems Solved, lines 3-4 are {{interpreted}} as {{alluding to the}} youth's beauty as a contrast with his friends. As the youth's beauty wanes, so his friends wither, as he grows older; contrasting Sethna's view of the youth's beauty accentuating Shakespeare's lack of beauty. Rowse also suggests that this idea may also imply a further consistency; Shakespeare's concern with the <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> flow of things; their waxing and waning. Perhaps the influence of constant Ovidian thought.|$|E
