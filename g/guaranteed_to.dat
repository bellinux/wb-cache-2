5|$|In Smith's view, the {{opportunity}} to achieve exaltation extended to all humanity; those who died with no opportunity to accept saving ordinances could achieve exaltation by accepting them in the afterlife through ordinances performed on their behalf. Smith said that children who died in their innocence would be <b>guaranteed</b> <b>to</b> rise at the resurrection and receive exaltation. Apart from those who committed the eternal sin, Smith taught that even the wicked and disbelieving would achieve a degree of glory in the afterlife.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present tehniques to {{to improve the}} {{performance}} TCP/IP over satellite-ATM networks, and to provide minimum rate <b>guarantees</b> <b>to</b> VCs carrying TCP/IP trac. Many future systems are proposing to use ATM or ATM like technology to transport TCP/IP based data. These systems must be designed to support best effort services, as well as enhanced services that provide minimum rate <b>guarantees</b> <b>to</b> TCP/IP traffic. In this paper we study four main issues. First, we discuss techniques for optimizing TCP performance over satellite networks using the Unspecified Bit Rate (UBR) service. We then demonstrate that high priority background traffic can degrade TCP performance over UBR, and we discuss the use of rate <b>guarantees</b> <b>to</b> improve performance. We design a full factorial experiment to assess the buffer requirements for TCP over satellite-ATM networks. Finally, we discuss {{the use of the}} Guaranteed Frame Rate (GFR) service category to provide minimum rate <b>guarantees</b> <b>to</b> VCs carrying TCP/IP trac. We propose the Differential Fair Buer Allocation (DFBA) scheme for buffer management that provides GFR <b>guarantees</b> <b>to</b> TCP/IP trac over satellite latencies. We use full factorial experimental design with various latencies, buer sizes, and TCP types for our simulations...|$|R

For instance, Java 8 uses an Xorshift pseudorandom number generator to construct these values.|$|E

The Union Cabinet of India then amended the Indian Flag Code with effect from 26 January 2002, allowing private citizens to hoist the flag on any day of the year, subject to their safeguarding the dignity, honour and respect of the flag. It is also held that the code was not a statute and restrictions under the code ought to be followed; also, the right to fly the flag is a qualified right, unlike the absolute rights <b>guaranteed</b> <b>to</b> citizens, and should be interpreted in the context of Article 19 of the Constitution of India.|$|E
5|$|Augmentation {{involves}} the supplemental release of natural enemies {{that occur in}} a particular area, boosting the naturally occurring populations there. In inoculative release, small numbers of the control agents are released at intervals {{to allow them to}} reproduce, in the hope of setting up longer-term control, and thus keeping the pest down to a low level, constituting prevention rather than cure. In inundative release, in contrast, large numbers are released in the hope of rapidly reducing a damaging pest population, correcting a problem that has already arisen. Augmentation can be effective, but is not <b>guaranteed</b> <b>to</b> work, and depends on the precise details of the interactions between each pest and control agent.|$|E
5|$|Avicenna {{distinguishes between}} {{a thing that}} needs an {{external}} cause in order to exista contingent thingand a thing that is <b>guaranteed</b> <b>to</b> exist by its essence or intrinsic naturea necessary existent. The argument, or proof, tries to prove that there is indeed a necessary existent. It does this by first considering whether the opposite could be true: that everything that exists is contingent. Each contingent thing will need something other than itself to bring it into existence, which will in turn need another cause to bring it into existence, and so on. Because this seemed to lead to an infinite regress, cosmological arguments before Avicenna concluded that some necessary cause (such as God) is needed to end the infinite chain. However, Avicenna's argument does not preclude {{the possibility of an}} infinite regress.|$|E

In Singapore, the right to freedom of speech and expression is <b>guaranteed</b> <b>to</b> citizens by Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution, though it is subject to many qualifications.

5|$|Gergonne's insight {{was that}} if a line L1 could be {{constructed}} such that A1 and B1 were <b>guaranteed</b> <b>to</b> fall on it, those two points could be identified as the intersection points of L1 with the given circle C1 (Figure6). The remaining four tangent points would be located similarly, by finding lines L2 and L3 that contained A2 and B2, and A3 and B3, respectively. To construct a line such as L1, two points must be identified that lie on it; but these points need not be the tangent points. Gergonne was able to identify two other points {{for each of the}} three lines. One of the two points has already been identified: the radical center G lies on all three lines (Figure6).|$|E

5|$|Known {{methods for}} {{repeatedly}} finding the closest pair of clusters in a dynamic set of clusters either require superlinear space {{to maintain a}} data structure that can find closest pairs quickly, or they take greater than linear time to find each closest pair.

In this way, it avoids the problem of repeatedly finding closest pairs. Nevertheless, for many types of clustering problem, it can be <b>guaranteed</b> <b>to</b> come up with the same hierarchical clustering as the greedy algorithm despite the different merge order.|$|E
