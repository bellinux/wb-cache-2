There is a spring running down {{the face of a}} high rock {{on the east side of}} the isle; it petrifies into a white substance, of which very fine lime is made, and there is a great quantity of it. There is a quarry of good stone on the same side of the isle; there is abundance of caves on the west side, which serve to lodge several families, who for their convenience in grazing, fishing, , resort thither in the summer. On the west side, particularly near to the village Clachan, the shore abounds with smooth stones of different sizes, variegated all over. The same cattle, fowl, and fish are produced <b>here</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> found in the isle of Skye. There is a law observed by the natives that all their fishing lines must be of equal length, for the longest is always supposed to have best access to the fish, which would prove a disadvantage to such as might have shorter ones.|$|E
2500|$|Although Full Moon was {{nominated}} for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R Album at the 2003 Grammy Awards, media reception for the album was generally mixed. The album so far has a score of 60 out of 100 from Metacritic based on [...] "mixed or average reviews". Craig Seymour of Entertainment Weekly gave Full Moon an A− rating, saying that [...] "where [...] Jerkins' herky-jerky stylings come off cold on Jacko's latest, they embolden 23-year-old Brandy as she learns the difference between teen heartbreak and grown-up betrayal, [...] maturity and the high price that often comes with it." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic was critical with the album's length of over 70 minutes but considered it Norwood's most assured, risky album yet, stating: [...] "Full Moon comes the closest to being a full-fledged, well-rounded album, as well as establishing a personality as a singer [...] There are plenty of moments <b>here</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> seductively smooth and even the filler goes down smoothly." [...] He gave the album four out of five stars.|$|E

2500|$|.....Is a Real Boy has {{received}} almost universally positive reviews from music critics. AbsolutePunk.net reviewer Jason Tate awarded the album a 99% rating and praised the band's writing, saying [...] "By the second song it is perceptible that the band has a grasp on crafting songs {{that do not}} follow a formula, or insult the listener by maintaining a hold on one particular style or sound." [...] Allmusic's Corey Apar also gave the album a glowing review, writing [...] "...Is a Real Boy comes off as an impressively well-done, multifaceted effort that deserves multiple spins and makes Say Anything truly a band to watch." [...] Punk News noted that the album seems to be commenting in the over-use of irony in the emo scene, writing [...] "Yes, this album is highly ironic in that it's critical of the scene it's categorized in and it's an album about a band and there are songs in <b>here</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> about songs. But, Bemis's overall quirkiness makes it work." [...] Entertainment Weekly wrote that, [...] "Say Anything, an emo act based in L.A., has a new disc that proves that the genre can be artful and intriguing." [...] BuzzFeed included the album at number 19 on their [...] "36 Pop Punk Albums You Need To Hear Before You F——ing Die" [...] list.|$|E
2500|$|On April 18, 2009, C.K. {{recorded}} a concert film titled Hilarious. Unlike his previous specials—which {{had all been}} produced for television networks—Hilarious was produced independently, directed by C.K. himself, and sold to Epix and Comedy Central after it was complete. As a result, it was not released until late 2010. It was published on DVD and CD in 2011. It is the first stand-up comedy film accepted into the Sundance Film Festival. From 2009 to 2012, C.K. played Dave Sanderson, a police officer and ex-boyfriend of Leslie Knope (played by Amy Poehler) in the sitcom Parks and Recreation. He also co-starred in the romantic comedy fantasy film The Invention of Lying, directed by and starring Ricky Gervais, in 2009. In a 2010 interview, C.K. talked about how, after his divorce, he thought, [...] "well, there goes my act." [...] He alluded to the way that his marriage had been central to his act and his life, {{and he said that}} it took him approximately a year to realize [...] "I'm accumulating stories <b>here</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> worth telling." [...] One element in his preparation for stand-up was training at the same boxing gym as Lowell, Massachusetts fighter Micky Ward, trying to [...] "learn how to ... do the grunt work and the boring, constant training so that you'll be fit enough to take the beating." ...|$|E

60|$|Rollo was right, for {{the bank}} of the river {{opposite}} Bingen was very steep and high, and was terraced from top to bottom for vineyards. In fact, this part of the river is more celebrated, perhaps, than any other for the excellent quality of the grapes which it produces. It is <b>here</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> situated the famous vineyards of Rudesheim and Johannisberg. In fact, the whole country, for miles in extent, is one vast vineyard. The separate fields are divided from one another by the terrace walls, which run parallel to the river, and by paths formed sometimes by steps, and sometimes by zigzags, which ascend and descend from the crest of the hills above to the line of the shore. The only buildings to be seen among all this vast expanse of walls and terraces are the little watchtowers that are erected here and there at commanding points to enable the vinegrowers to watch the fruit, {{when it comes to the}} time of ripening. The laborers who till the fields, and dress the vines, and gather the grapes in the season, live all of them in compact villages, built at intervals along the shore.|$|E

Why, look at this dress--real India chintz; do you know I made old Pennywhistle's clerk up in Brunswick {{give it to me}} just for the price of common cotton? You see there was a yard of it had got faded by lying in the shop-window, and there were one or two holes and imperfections in it, and you ought to have heard the talk I made! I abused it to right and left, and actually at last I brought the poor wretch to believe that he ought to be grateful to me for taking it off his hands. Well, you see the dress I've made of it. The imperfections didn't hurt it the least in the world as I managed it,--and the faded breadth makes a good apron, so you see. And just so I got that red spotted flannel dress I wore last winter. It was moth-eaten in one or two places, and I made them let me have it at half-price;--made exactly as good a dress. But after all, Mara, I can't trim a bonnet as you can, and I can't come up to your embroidery, nor your lace-work, nor I can't draw and paint as you can, and I can't sing like you; and then as to all those things you talk with Mr. Sewell about, why they're beyond my depth,--that's all I've got to say.

6000|$|It {{seemed to}} be summer, [...] In the forenoon of the day; and the master's diligent pencil [...] Laid its last light touches on Eve driven forth out of Eden, [...] Otherwise Violante, and while his pupils about him [...] Wrought and chattered, in silence ran {{the thought of the}} painter: [...] "She, and forever she! Is it come to be my perdition? [...] Shall I, then, never more make the face of a {{beautiful}} woman [...] But it must take her divine, accursèd beauty upon it, [...] And, when I finish my work, stand forth her visible presence? [...] Ah! I could take this sword and strike it into her bosom! [...] Though I believe my own heart's blood would stream from the [...] painting, [...] So much I love her! Yes, that look is marvellous like you, [...] Wandering, tender--such as I'd give my salvation to win you [...] Once to bend upon me! But I knew myself better than make you, [...] Lest I should play the fool about you here before people, [...] Helpless to turn away from your violet eyes, Violante, [...] That have turned all my life to a vision of madness." [...] The painter [...] Here unto speech betraying the thoughts he had silently pondered, [...] "Visions, visions, my son?" [...] said a gray old friar who listened, [...] Seated there in the sun, with his eye on the work of the painter [...] Fishily fixed, while the master blasphemed behind his mustaches. [...] "Much have I envied your Art, who vouchsafeth to those who adore [...] her [...] Visions of heavenly splendor denied to fastings and vigils. [...] I have spent days and nights of faint and painful devotion, [...] Scourged myself almost to death, without one glimpse of the glory [...] Which your touch has revealed in the face of that heavenly maiden. [...] Pleasure me to repeat what it was you were saying of visions: [...] Fain would I know how they come to you, though I never see them, [...] And in my thickness of hearing I fear some words have escaped me." [...] Then, while the painter glared on the lifted face of the friar, [...] Baleful, breathless, bewildered, fiercer than noon in the dog-days, [...] Round the circle of pupils there ran a tittering murmur; [...] From the lips to the ears of those nameless Beppis and Gigis [...] Buzzed the stinging whisper: [...] "Let's hear Pordenone's confession." [...] Well they knew the master's luckless love, and whose portrait [...] He had unconsciously painted there, and guessed that his visions [...] Scarcely were those conceived by the friar, who constantly [...] blundered [...] Round the painter at work, mistaking every subject-- [...] Noah's drunken Debauch for the Stoning of Stephen the Martyr, [...] And the Conversion of Paul for the Flight into Egypt; forever [...] Putting his hand to his ear and shouting, [...] "Speak louder, I pray [...] you!" [...] So they waited now, in silent, amused expectation, [...] Till Pordenone's angry scorn should gather to bursting. [...] Long the painter gazed in furious silence, then slowly [...] Uttered a kind of moan, and turned again to his labor. [...] Tears gathered into his eyes, of mortification and pathos, [...] And when the dull old monk, who forgot, while he waited the answer, [...] Visions and painter, and all, had maundered away in his error, [...] Pordenone half envied the imbecile peace of his bosom; [...] "For in my own," [...] he mused, [...] "is such a combat of devils, [...] That I believe torpid age or stupid youth would be better [...] Than this manhood of mine that has climbed aloft to discover [...] Heights which I never can reach, and bright on the pinnacle [...] standing [...] In the unfading light, my rival crowned victor above me. [...] If I could hint what I feel, what forever escapes from my pencil, [...] All after-time should know my will was not less than my failure, [...] Nor should any one dare remember me merely in pity. [...] All should read my sorrows and do my discomfiture homage, [...] Saying: 'Not meanly at any time this painter meant or endeavored; [...] His was the anguish of one who falls short of the highest [...] achievement, [...] Conscious of doing his utmost, and knowing how vast his defeat is. [...] Life, if he would, might have had some second guerdon to give him, [...] But he would only the first; and behold! Let us honor [...] Grief such as his must have been; no other sorrow can match it! [...] There are certainly some things <b>here</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> nobly imagined: [...] Look! here is masterly power in this play of light, and these [...] shadows [...] Boldly are massed; and what color! One can well understand [...] Buonarotti [...] Saying the sight of his Curtius was worth the whole journey from [...] Florence. [...] Here is a man at least never less than his work; you can feel it [...] As you can feel in Titian's the painter's inferior spirit. [...] He and this Pordenone, you know, were rivals; and Titian [...] Knew how to paint to the popular humor, and spared not [...] Foul means or fair (his way with rivals) to crush Pordenone, [...] Who with an equal chance'-- [...] "Alas, if the whole world should tell me [...] I was his equal in art, and the lie could save me from torment, [...] So must I be lost, for my soul could never believe it! [...] Nay, let my envy snarl as fierce as it will at his glory, [...] Still, when I look on his work, my soul makes obeisance within me, [...] Humbling itself before the touch that shall never be equalled." ...|$|E
