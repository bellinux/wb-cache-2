6000|$|The ascent was {{alternately}} over steep rocky slopes, {{and broad}} shelf-like flats; many more plants grew here than I had expected, in inconspicuous scattered tufts.* [Besides those before mentioned, there were Fescue-grass (Festuca ovina of Scotland), a strong-scented silky wormwood (Artemisia), and round tufts of Oxytropis chiliophylla, {{a kind of}} Astralagus that inhabits eastern and western Tibet; this alone was green: it formed great circles on the ground, the centre decaying, and the annual shoots growing outwards, and thus constantly enlarging the circle. A woolly Leontopodium, Androsace, and some other plants assumed nearly the same mode of growth. The rest of the vegetation consisted of a Sedum, Nardostachys <b>Jatamansi,</b> Meconopsis horridula, a slender Androsace, Gnaphalium, Stipa, Salvia, Draba, Pedicularis, Potentilla or Sibbaldia, Gentiana and Erigeron alpinus of Scotland. All these grow nearly up to 18,000 feet.] The rocks were nearly vertical strata of quartz, hornstone, and conglomerate, striking north-west, and dipping south-west 80 degrees. The broad {{top of the hill}} was also of quartz, but covered with angular pebbles of the rocks transported from Kinchinjhow. Some clay-stone fragments were stained red with oxide of iron, and covered with Parmelia miniata;* [This minute lichen, mentioned at chapter xxxii, is the most Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine in the world; often occurring so abundantly as to colour the rocks of an orange red. This was the case at Bhomtso, and is so also in Cockburn Island in the Antarctic ocean, which it covers so profusely that the rocks look as if brightly painted. See [...] "Ross's Voyage," [...] vol. ii. p. 339.] this, with Borrera, another lichen, which forms stringy masses blown along by the wind, were the only plants, and they are among the most alpine in the world.|$|E
60|$|Soon {{after my}} arrival I was waited {{on by the}} Guobah (or head-man), a tall, good-looking person, dressed in a purple woollen robe, with good pearl and coral ear and finger-rings, and a broad ivory ring over the left thumb,* [A broad ring of this material, agate, or chalcedony, is a mark of rank here, as amongst the Man-choos, and {{throughout}} Central Asia.] as a guard when using the bow; he wore a neat thick white felt cap, with the border turned up, and a silk tassel on the top; this he removed {{with both hands and}} held before him, bowing three times on entering. He was followed by a crowd, some of whom were his own people, and brought a present of a kid, fowls, rice, and eggs, and some spikenard roots (Nardostachys <b>Jatamansi,</b> a species of valerian smelling strongly of patchouli), which is a very favourite perfume. After paying some compliments, he showed me round the village. During my walk, I found that I had a good many objections to overrule before I could proceed to the Wallanchoon pass, nearly two days' journey to the northward. In the first place, the Guobah disputed the Nepal rajah's authority to pass me through his dominions; and besides the natural jealousy of these people when intruded upon, they have very good reasons for concealing the amount of revenue they raise from their position, and for keeping up the delusion that they alone can endure the excessive climate of these regions, or undergo the hardships and toil of the salt trade. My passport said nothing about the passes; my people, and especially the Ghorkas, detested the keen, cold, and cutting wind; at Mywa Guola, I had been persuaded by the Havildar to put off providing snow-boots and blankets, on the assurance that I should easily get them at Walloong, which I now found all but impossible, owing to there being no bazaar. My provisions were running short, and for the same reason I had no present hope of replenishing them. All my party had, I found, reckoned with certainty that I should have had enough of this elevation and weather by the time I reached Walloong. Some of them fell sick; the Guobah swore that the passes were full of snow, and had been impracticable since October; and the Ghorka Havildar respectfully deposed that he had no orders relative to the pass. Prompt measures were requisite, so I told all my people that I should stop the next day at Walloong, and proceed on the following on a three days' journey to the pass, with or without the Guobah's permission. To the Ghorka soldiers I said that the present they would receive, and the character they would take to their commandant, depended on their carrying out this point, which had been fully explained before starting. My servants I told that their pay and reward also depended on their implicit obedience. I took the Guobah aside and showed him troops of yaks (tethered by halters and toggles to a long rope stretched between two rocks), which had that morning arrived laden with salt from the north; I told him it was vain to try and deceive me; that my passport was ample, and that I should expect a guide, provisions, and snow-boots the next day; and that every impediment and every facility should be reported to the rajah.|$|E

[...] Sir William Jones, in his [...] "Asiatic Researches," [...] concludes that the nard of the ancients was Valeriana <b>jatamansi.</b> This plant is called sunbul, or [...] "spike," [...] by the Arabs, {{from the fact that}} its base is surrounded with ears or spikes, whence comes its Hebrew appellation, [...] "shibboleth nerd" [...] = [...] "spike" [...] + [...] "nard." [...] Isidore of Seville, when describing this aromatic, says that it is a prickly herb, light in weight, golden, hairy, small of ear, very fragrant and resembling galingale.

50|$|Valeriana wallichii, {{the major}} {{species of the}} genus Valeriana is native to India. Nepal and China. As an {{important}} substitute for the European V. officinalis, it has been traditionally used in treatment of sleep problems, obesity, nervous disorders and snake poisoning and skin diseases. Uttarakhand, part of Indian North western Himalaya, represents a mountainous region that encompasses agroclimatic conditions ranging from tropical to alpine and, thus, possesses a rich biodiversity. Valeriana, the major genus in the family Valerianaceae, is characterized by perennials that have three stamens without spurs on the slightly swollen base of the corolla, with a short and often strong-smelling root stalk. Strachey reported in 1918 the occurrence of five Valeriana species, V. dioica L., V. pyrolaefolia, V. stracheyi, V. wallichii DC., and V. hardwickii, at elevations ranging from 1500 ± 4300 m. A re-investigation of the morphology, distribution, and biodiversity of the Indian Valerianaceae, however, showed a total of 16 species/subspecies, of which six, namely V. wallichii DC. (V. <b>jatamansi),</b> V. himalayana (V. dioica L.), V. pyrolaefolia, V. mussooriensis, V. hardwickii. var. hardwickii, and V. hardwickii. var. arnottiana (Wt.

5000|$|It {{was first}} brought to Russia in 1535 as a {{substitute}} for musk; and in 1867 was introduced into the British pharmacopoeia. The root as found in commerce consists of transverse sections an inch or more in thickness and from 1 to 3 or more inches in diameter. It has a dark thin papery bark, a spongy texture, and the cut surface is marbled with white and blackish or pale brown; it has a musky odor and a bitter aromatic taste. The action and uses of the drug are the same as those of asafetida. It owes its medicinal properties to a resin and an essential oil. Of the former, it contains about 9% and of the latter 3%. The resin is soluble in ether and has a musky smell, which is not fully developed until after contact with water. Under the name of East Indian sumbul, the root of Dorema ammoniacum has occasionally been offered in English commerce. It is of a browner hue, has the taste of ammoniacum, and gives a much darker tincture than the genuine drug; it is thus easily detected.

40|$|Electron beam {{radiation}}, {{a form of}} Ionizing radiation has {{an important}} role in diagnosing and treatment of many diseases. But the deposition of this energy in tissues results in damage to DNA and eradicates the cell’s ability to replicate indefinitely. During the past few years due to their widespread use in hospitals, concern regarding the hazardous effect of electron beam radiation has developed. This pre-clinical work was designed to test the antidepressant activity of Nardostachys <b>jatamansi</b> ethanolic root extract on whole body electron beam radiation induced depression in Swiss albino mice, using established models for depression. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate antidepressant effect of Nardostachys <b>jatamansi</b> ethanolic root extract in electron beam irradiated mice. Nardostachys <b>jatamansi</b> ethanolic root extract at the dose of 200 mg/kg, orally was administered in electron beam radiated mice for screening its antidepressant effect using two validated experimental models for depression i. e., Forced Swimming Test and Tail Suspension Test. The duration of immobility (in seconds) was noted in both the tests. The electron beam radiated mice treated with Nardostachys <b>jatamansi</b> ethanolic root extract has shown a significant reduction in the duration of immobility (in seconds) in both the tests on comparing with non treated electron beam radiated mice. The data suggest that exposure to low levels of electron beam radiation can cause depression, which can be abolished by the administration of Nardostachys <b>jatamansi</b> ethanolic root extract...|$|E

40|$|An aqueous root {{extract from}} Nardostachys <b>jatamansi</b> was {{investigated}} for its antioxidant and anticataleptic {{effects in the}} haloperidol-induced catalepsy rat model of the disease by measuring various behavioral and biochemical parameters. Catalepsy was induced by administration of haloperidol (1 mg/kg, ip) in male albino rats. A significant (P < 0. 01) reduction in the cataleptic scores were observed in all the drug-treated groups {{as compared to the}} haloperidol-treated group; with maximum reduction observed in the Nardostachys <b>jatamansi</b> (250 and 500 mg/kg body weight) administered group. To estimate biochemical parameters: the generation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS); reduced glutathione (GSH) content and glutathione-dependent enzymes; catalase; and superoxide dismutase (SOD), in the brain were assessed. Haloperidol administration increased generation of TBARS and significantly reduced GSH, which were restored to near normal level with the Nardostachys <b>jatamansi</b> treatment. Catalase and SOD levels were also increased to normal levels, having been reduced significantly by haloperidol administration. Our findings of behavioral studies and biochemical estimations show that Nardostachys <b>jatamansi</b> reversed the haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats. We conclude that the antioxidant potential has contributed to the reduction in the oxidative stress and catalepsy induced by haloperidol administration...|$|E
40|$|Nardostachys <b>jatamansi</b> DC. and Selinum vaginatum (Edgew) Cl. are two endemic high {{altitude}} Indian medicinal plants {{that have been}} traditionally known as “Jatamansi” and “Bhootkeshi,” respectively. These are used in various traditional herbal formulations and nutraceuticals, {{as well as to}} treat neurological disorders like epilepsy, hysteria, syncope, convulsions, and mental weakness. They resemble each other in their external morphological characters and characteristic odour, so their roots are often confused with each other. Since free radicals have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a considerable range of neurological disorders, including seizures and epilepsy, analysis of these two important medicinal plants was carried out based on their antioxidant activities and phenolic profiles. N. <b>jatamansi</b> expressed better antioxidant activity with both DPPH and TAC methods. Strong correlation was seen between TPC and antioxidant activities. Phenolic compounds such as chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, protocatechuic acid, and syringic acid were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively in the methanol extracts of N. <b>jatamansi</b> and S. vaginatum by HPLC. N. <b>jatamansi</b> was found to contain only protocatechuic and syringic acids while chlorogenic and ferulic acids were present only in S. vaginatum. The studies suggest that both of the plants exhibit distinctive properties and that their similar therapeutic uses may be dependent on synergistic effects exhibited by the different compounds present in them...|$|E
