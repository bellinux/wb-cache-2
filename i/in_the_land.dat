5|$|By 1936 {{there was}} already a demand for reprints of Tintin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> of the Soviets, with Lesne sending a letter to Hergé enquiring if this was possible. The {{cartoonist}} was reluctant, stating that the original plates for the story were now in a poor condition and {{that as a result}} he would have to redraw the entire story were it to be re-published. Several years later, amid the German occupation of Belgium during World War II, a German-run publishing company asked Hergé for permission to republish Tintin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> of the Soviets, with the intent of using it as anti-Soviet propaganda, but again Hergé declined the offer.|$|E

5|$|Grim Fandango {{takes place}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> of the Dead (the Eighth Underworld), where {{recently}} departed souls {{aim to make}} their way to the Land of Eternal Rest (the Ninth Underworld). Good deeds in life are rewarded by access to better travel packages to assist in making the journey of the soul, the best of which is the Number Nine, a train that takes four minutes to reach the gate to the Ninth Underworld. Souls who did not lead a kind life are left to travel through the Land of the Dead on foot, which would take around four years. Such souls often lose faith in the existence of the Ninth Underworld and instead find jobs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> of the Dead. The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the Grim Reaper to escort the souls from the mortal world to the Land of the Dead, and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited. Each year on the Day of the Dead, these souls are allowed to visit their families <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> of the Living.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 1916, J. Grossman's Sons {{contacted}} American jazz composers Peter DeRose and Ivan Reid {{to write}} a song about Grapico. DeRose, who would later {{be inducted into the}} Songwriters Hall of Fame, produced the piano accompanied song, Meet Me <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> of Grapico. Meet Me <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> of Grapico is a sentimental ballad from Tin Pan Alley that imagined a faraway Land of Grapico where love lives forever. The song (see below) and its cover sheet alluded to a grape vine-covered arbor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> of Grapico, even though Grapico contained no grape juice. Dedicating the song to all the drinkers of Grapico, J. Grossman's Sons published the song in 1916 and provided it free on request.|$|E
5|$|The Dummi Bears are parodies of the Care Bears franchise, and {{the film}} they are {{featured}} <b>in,</b> <b>The</b> <b>Land</b> Without Smiles, is a parody of the feature length 1985 film The Care Bears Movie based on the franchise, while {{the title of the}} film is a reference to the Care Bears' first TV special from 1983, The Care Bears <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> Without Feelings. The Dummi Bears' name is a reference to the TV series Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears. One scene <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Land</b> Without Smiles details the Dummi Bears firing valentines from the clouds for all the sad, bullied and lonely, teased children in the world references a similar scene from The Care Bears Movie.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{creation}} of the new archdiocese, Jaenberht retained his position as the senior cleric <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>land,</b> with Hygeberht conceding his precedence. When Jaenberht died in 792, he was replaced by Æthelheard, who was consecrated by Hygeberht, now senior in his turn. Subsequently Æthelheard appears as a witness on charters and presides at synods without Hygeberht, so it appears that Offa continued to respect Canterbury's authority.|$|E
5|$|Eskimo was not {{the first}} {{dramatic}} film to use an all-native cast for the native roles; that was the 1914 silent film <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> of the Head Hunters. It was, however, the first motion picture to be filmed in the language of a Native American people, and the first feature film shot in Alaska. Ray Mala became nationally famous for his work in Eskimo, and subsequently had a long career as a lead and supporting actor in Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|Following on from Tintin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Land</b> of the Soviets and {{bolstered by}} {{publicity}} stunts, Tintin in the Congo was a commercial success within Belgium {{and was also}} serialised in France.

In 1946, Hergé re-drew and coloured Tintin in the Congo in his distinctive ligne-claire style for republication by Casterman, with further alterations made {{at the request of}} his Scandinavian publisher for a 1975 edition.|$|E
