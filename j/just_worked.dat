When Billman 1943 was asked, by the {{ombudsman}} Knut Ring at Swedish Seafarers' Union and the art historian Carl Nordenfalk at Gothenburg Museum of Art, {{if he wanted to}} carry out a buon fresco on two walls of 20 metres in the New Seamen Homes ceremonial room, Billman had <b>just</b> <b>worked</b> with woodcuts and small ink illustrations. But 1943 Billman start to work on his first buon fresco painting To Sailors - Workers at Sea (1944) in Seamen's Home in Gothenburg. Billman depicts coal trimmer and stoker down in coal bunkers and stokeholes with self-perceived realism, which has not been previously seen in buon frescoes. There are also events from World War II, for example when Nazi aircraft attacking a merchant ship etc.|$|E

After winning the 400m, Ballard said: [...] "This is the one I wanted. I was so nervous coming in, you try and tell yourself that {{the worst thing that}} can happen is a loss and starting again tomorrow, {{but the reality is that}} this matters so much. I was so scared before the race, perhaps it gave me the adrenalin to get it done. I’ve <b>just</b> <b>worked</b> so hard for this for so long."

500|$|These {{sequences}} {{were inspired}} by Jean's dissatisfaction with some network executives, who he felt took control over a television series {{he was working on}} before he returned to The Simpsons in 1999. [...] "I had <b>just</b> <b>worked</b> on a show on another network [...] we had a show where {{there were a lot of}} notes from executives", Jean said of the inspiration for the scenes. The episode would originally have a different ending, but it was changed to its current iteration after the writers did not find the original ending humorous enough. When recording the DVD commentary however, Jean said that he was a bit dissatisfied with the new ending. [...] "I think we did leave it a little hanging", he said.|$|E

500|$|Goddard {{originally}} {{auditioned for}} Brad Snyder on As the World Turns, {{and though he}} was not cast in the part, Barbara Bloom, the senior vice-president of CBS Daytime, recommended Goddard to The Young and the Restlesss head writer and executive producer, Latham. After testing for the character of Cane for Latham and casting director Karen Rea, Goddard received the role. The Australian actor auditioned with an American accent, but when the writers found out about his Australian background, that influenced Cane's backstory. The actor stated that, [...] "The concept of Cane {{was that he was}} given away at birth. So he could have been from Mongolia. It <b>just</b> <b>worked</b> out luckily for me that I was the right person for the job." [...] Since the producers could not understand the actor's real Australian accent, Goddard [...] "Americanized" [...] it while portraying the character.|$|E

He had brought up in our conversation how he saw the artistic value of SpongeBob as the cartoon and I kind of liked it, so I did it." [...] He further added that [...] "It's funny." [...] The tattoo was described by blogger and TV personality Perez Hilton {{as one of the}} [...] "Worst Celebrity Tattoos". In the same year, A Bathing Ape released SpongeBob-themed shoes. Singer Pharrell Williams backed a line of SpongeBob T-shirts and shoes targeted at hip adults. In 2014, the character was among the popular culture icons referenced by American fashion designer Jeremy Scott in his Moschino debut collection at the Milan Fashion Week.|$|E
500|$|Before All My Children {{offered him}} {{the role of}} Dimitri Marick, Nader already planned on working in both Los Angeles and New York.

[...] "She had an apartment here and I had been seeking out some theater here in New York {{and would have been}} spending time both here and in L.A.

[...] Despite Nader's prime time success as Dynasty's Dex Dexter, he did not look down on daytime television. [...] "The {{fact of the matter is}} we're in a different era," [...] he said. [...] "And if you look at the cutbacks in Hollywood, being on a soap is not of any less or more value than being in any other medium at this time." [...] Another factor that contributed to his decision to join All My Children was the actors strike. He intended to stay on All My Children for a year. That year turned into more because the actor fell in love with New York.|$|E

500|$|The {{popularity}} and recognition received by [...] "Cog" [...] led {{a number of}} other companies to create pieces in a similar vein—either as homages, in parody, or simply to further explore the design space. The first of these was <b>Just</b> <b>Works,</b> a deliberate parody advertisement for the 118 118 directory assistance service in the summer of 2003, in which the Honda parts are replaced with such oddities as a tractor wheel, a flamingo and a space hopper, with impetus provided by two moustachioed runners. <b>Just</b> <b>Works</b> was created by advertising agency WCRS. It was written by Anson Harris and directed by JJ Keith, whose previous work included spots for BT Cellnet, Heinz, and Guinness, and the Oscar-nominated short film Holiday Romance. Honda refused to give WCRS permission to copy their advert, which, under BACC guidelines, prevented either the 60- or 90-second <b>Just</b> <b>Works</b> spots from appearing on British television. Instead, the ad was shown online and promoted virally. <b>Just</b> <b>Works</b> went on to win a number of awards in its own right, including Golds in several categories at the British Television Advertising Awards and the Creative Circle Awards, a Silver Lion from the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival, and a Bronze award from The One Club.|$|R
500|$|In early 2007, it was {{reported}} that Madonna was recording songs with American singer Justin Timberlake for her upcoming eighth studio album. Later, it was also announced that record producers Timbaland and Pharrell Williams were working with her on the album, and Timbaland confirmed that a song titled [...] "Candy Shop" [...] was being produced by Williams. On July 2007, a demo of the song, titled [...] "Candy Store", leaked online, but was quickly removed following copyright issues. [...] "Candy Shop" [...] was the first song Madonna and Williams worked on together. The latter recalled, [...] "we were just in a studio, [...] and [...] was like, 'Look, give me some hot shit.' I was looking at her like, 'She's saying hot shit?' She was like, 'What?' And I'm like, 'OK.' So we <b>just</b> <b>worked</b> and made it." [...] Madonna stated during an interview with Q magazine that [...] "Candy Shop", along with album track [...] "Devil Wouldn't Recognize You", was among her favorite songs, [...] "I love 'Candy Shop' cos it's cheeky and fun, and I feel it sort of represents the sassy side of me; the fun, sassy side of me.

500|$|In the Gold Medal {{match in}} London, the team faced the Australia women's {{national}} wheelchair basketball team, who had defeated them 48–46 in Sydney {{just a few}} months before, in front of a capacity crowd of over 12,000 at the North Greenwich Arena. The German team had been undefeated up to that point, but had started off slow in its games against the United States and China, winning these games by six-point margins, and seemed to play its best basketball only in the final minutes of a game. Adermann scored 19 points, more than any other player in the match, and was a key factor in Germany winning 58-44. [...] "Most of my shots weren’t even any crazy shots or any outside shots,” Adermann said. [...] "They were the same shots I took in the others games, but I played more in this game, and I had many more easy opportunities getting into the paint." [...] "I’m always one of the shooters, but I think Australia underestimated me and didn’t defend me {{as well as some of}} the other girls. They left me open a lot and I got some big shots, so it went well for me. It <b>just</b> <b>worked</b> out that I scored the most points in the final, but it wasn’t deliberate." ...|$|E
500|$|With Interview magazine, Madonna {{explained}} her inspirations {{behind the}} songs and the music of Hard Candy. She said that [...] "probably in many respects most of the songs [...] are [...] But in more of an unconscious way. I don't really think about telling personal stories when I'm writing music. It just comes. And {{then a lot of}} times, six months later, eight months later, I go, 'Oh, that's what I wrote that song about.' But that's when I play the song for lots of people and they all go, 'Oh, I can totally relate to that.'" [...] "Candy Shop" [...] is the opening track of the album. Produced by Williams, the song uses the word candy as a metaphor for sex. Williams said, [...] "We were just in a studio, [...] and [...] was like, 'Look, give me some hot shit.' I was looking at her like, 'She's saying hot shit?' She was like, 'What?' And I'm like, 'OK.' So we <b>just</b> <b>worked</b> and made it." [...] The first single from the album, [...] "4 Minutes", was initially known as [...] "4 Minutes to Save the World". The song's development was motivated by a sense of urgency to save the planet from destruction, and how people can enjoy themselves in the process. According to Madonna, the song inspired her to produce the documentary I Am Because We Are. The song features vocals by Timberlake and Timbaland. An uptempo dance song with an urban, hip hop style, it also incorporates Timbaland's bhangra beats. The instrumentation used in the song includes brass, foghorns and cow bells. The song's lyrics carry a message of social awareness, inspired by Madonna's visit to Africa and the human suffering she witnessed.|$|E
