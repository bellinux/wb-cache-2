5|$|The {{flashback}} ends, and Desmond {{is pulled}} off Charlie by Hurley. They help Desmond to his tent. Charlie tries to <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> from him one last time. Desmond reveals that both times he rescued Claire, {{he was really}} saving Charlie; Charlie would have been electrocuted, and Charlie would have drowned attempting to save Claire from the ocean. Desmond tells Charlie that although he has prevented his death twice, Charlie is destined to die.|$|E
5|$|During the Red Scare, {{psychology}} professor Harry C. Steinmetz {{was accused of}} being a Communist. San Diego representatives persuaded the California legislature along with Governor Earl Warren to attempt to remove him from his teaching position. After the State Board of Education was unable to <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> from Steinmetz about {{whether or not he was}} a Communist, he was dismissed on February 5, 1954. He attempted to be reinstated but never was even after the legislation that had been developed during the Red Scare was later deemed unconstitutional.|$|E
5|$|In the Enchanted Forest, a guarded {{carriage}} carrying Prince Charming (Joshua Dallas) and his fiancee, Abigail (Anastasia Griffith), is halted by a roadblock. Charming {{notices a}} fallen tree is blocking the road, {{and that it}} was cut on purpose. The carriage is ambushed by a hooded vagabond, who takes Charming's bag of valuables, including a wedding ring. Charming pursues and knocks the mysterious thief off their horse. He discovers it is a woman, Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin). Before he can <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> as to why she stole his bag, Snow hits him with a rock, surprising and cutting him to make her escape. Charming vows that he will find her.|$|E

5000|$|In 2002, the {{business}} of the Dail was suspended in uproar when Gormley insisted on <b>getting</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> to his question regarding a tax on plastic bags ...|$|R

25|$|We can {{extrapolate}} {{from the}} above table that the step size needed to <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> that is correct to three decimal places is approximately 0.00001, meaning that we need 400,000 steps. This large number of steps entails a high computational cost. For this reason, people usually employ alternative, higher-order methods such as Runge–Kutta methods or linear multistep methods, especially if a high accuracy is desired.|$|E
25|$|At low momenta (infrared limit) the {{question}} has been more involved to settle. The {{reason is that the}} theory becomes strongly coupled in this case and perturbation theory cannot be applied. The only reliable approach to <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> is performing lattice computation on a computer powerful enough to afford large volumes. An answer to this question is a fundamental one as it would provide an understanding to the problem of confinement. On the other side, it should not be forgotten that propagators are gauge-dependent quantities and so, they must be managed carefully when one wants to get meaningful physical results.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} was {{considered}} a [...] "break-up song" [...] that talks about [...] "the waking death of a relationship, the stage of limbo before the final crash." [...] As Digital Spy's Robert Copsey added, its lyrics discuss [...] "the kind of separate-togetherness felt moments before a break-up." [...] Adam R. Holz of Plugged In noticed that [...] "'California King' ponders how a woman could be so physically close to a man yet so emotionally distant. She doesn't <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer,</b> but she does quip about evidence of their sexual relationship on the sheets the next morning. The woman also equates asking the man if he loves her with emotional weakness." [...] During the chorus, she sings: [...] "In this California king bed we’re ten thousand miles apart / I’ve been California wishing on these stars for your heart / For me, my California king." ...|$|E
60|$|The hurried {{directness}} {{with which}} she spoke--the absence of all her little airs, {{as if she were}} only concerned to use the time in <b>getting</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> that would guide her, made her appeal unspeakably touching.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, {{after leaving}} Elysion, Maxi sent an email to Napalm asking them {{if there was}} a band looking for a singer. A few hours later she had <b>gotten</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer,</b> <b>a</b> week later she went there to meet with Visions of Atlantis and played at Metalcamp with Satyricon, Testament and Blind Guardian. In June 2009 Maxi officially became the new vocalist for Visions of Atlantis.|$|R
60|$|When {{women have}} a point to gain {{in which they are}} interested, how many of them are capable of deferring it to a better opportunity? One in a thousand, perhaps. Iris kept her place at the window, {{resolved}} on <b>getting</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer.</b>|$|R
2500|$|For example, Robert Merges said, “To say {{we did not}} <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> is to {{miss the}} depth of the non-answer we did get.” John Duffy remarked, [...] "he Supreme Court has been remarkably {{resistant}} to providing clear guidance in this area, and this case continues that trend." ...|$|E
2500|$|Occasionally, by the way, I get {{a letter}} from someone who is in [...] "contact" [...] with an {{extraterrestrial}} who invites me to [...] "ask anything". And so I {{have a list of}} questions. The extraterrestrials are very advanced, remember. So I ask things like, [...] "Please give a short proof of Fermat's Last Theorem." [...] Or the Goldbach Conjecture. And then I have to explain what these are, because extraterrestrials will not call it Fermat's Last Theorem, so I write out the little equation with the exponents. I never <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer.</b> On the other hand, if I ask something like [...] "Should we humans be good?" [...] I always <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer.</b> I think something can be deduced from this differential ability to answer questions. Anything vague they are extremely happy to respond to, but anything specific, where there is a chance to find out if they actually know anything, there is only silence.|$|E
2500|$|In particular, Waldon criticizes reporters asking {{questions}} like [...] "'Did you kill your wife?'" [...] It's those silly questions that elevate a perp walk to a circus. That's {{the stuff of}} a Saturday Night Live skit. I think any question that's insulting, presumptuous or bullying is totally off limits." [...] Crime reporter Art Harris suggests that such questions are not designed to elicit real answers: [...] "Usually you get no response. The journalists who shout probably know {{they are not going}} to <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> but the reporter gets the voice on tape and his boss says, 'Hey, hey he is out there doing his job.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{first round}} had {{questions}} on six topics. For <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> question correct, the team get five points, and for <b>getting</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> [...] "close enough" [...] {{to the right}} answer they get 3 points. The losing team get sent to the [...] "Sin Bin", and 3 new competitors are selected from the audience.|$|R
5000|$|... rhetorical {{question}}: Asking {{a question}} {{as a way of}} asserting something. Asking a question which already has the answer hidden in it. Or asking a question not for the sake of <b>getting</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> but for asserting something (or as in a poem for creating a poetic effect) ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{he confessed}} to her, at first he didn't <b>get</b> <b>a</b> {{straight}} <b>answer.</b>|$|R
60|$|I did not <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer.</b> Colonel Ingram had ingloriously bolted, {{overturning}} a palm in his flight.|$|E
60|$|After many fruitless {{attempts}} made by Mrs. McKeon to <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> to this, Feemy said, {{through her}} friend, {{that she was}} sitting down.|$|E

5000|$|... to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> {{positive}} <b>answer.</b> Note that interrogative sentences {{always end}} with a question mark.|$|R
50|$|If the {{contestant}} <b>gets</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> wrong (and is not saved), they flunk out, {{and lose}} {{all of their}} winnings (or drop to $10,000, if they had surpassed the fifth question). As well, they may choose to drop out at any point during the game, which entitles them to leave the game with any winnings they have accumulated.|$|R
50|$|Photographs of two musicians appear side-by-side, with a trivia caption beneath them. Players must {{identify}} {{which of the}} two shown musicians the trivia fact corresponds to. When two photos with golden frames are placed side-by-side, that means that <b>a</b> correct <b>answer</b> to that question is worth five points. Teams must take turns in this round; when <b>a</b> team <b>gets</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> wrong, or when <b>a</b> team <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> golden-frame question correct, it's the other team's turn.|$|R
6000|$|But {{he could}} not <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> from the oracle on this head. Hardy continued, 'He's a nice young gentleman, but he'll never put up with it.' ...|$|E
60|$|Not {{being able}} to <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> from Mr. B., the figure turned peevishly to Mr. Gliddon, and, in a {{peremptory}} tone, demanded in general terms what we all meant.|$|E
60|$|She made {{a little}} calculation--she had twenty-eight and tenpence; exactly thirty-five francs--enough for seven days. If she wrote to Mrs. Vimpany at once she could <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> in five days.|$|E
5000|$|In 1956, a {{reviewer}} {{predicted that}} an alien visiting {{from another planet}} could ask anyone {{between the ages of}} seven and 70 [...] "What is What's my Line?" [...] and [...] "Who is Isobel Barnett?" [...] and be confident of <b>getting</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer.</b> She featured in the first revival of What's My Line? which ran for two series from 1973 to 1974.|$|R
50|$|Snippets of five {{music videos}} for songs from Round One are shown; six trivia facts appear on-screen, and the teams attempt {{to match the}} trivia facts to the {{corresponding}} music videos. Unlike {{the first two rounds}} of game play, teams must take turns in Round Three; when <b>a</b> team <b>gets</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> wrong, it's the other team's turn. Each correct answer is worth two points.|$|R
5000|$|If the {{contestant}} <b>gets</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> wrong (and is not saved), they [...] "flunk out", {{and lose}} everything — or drop to $25,000, if they surpassed the fifth question. They {{may choose to}} [...] "drop out" [...] at any point during the game (with {{the exception of the}} peek cheat noted above), which entitles them to leave the game with any winnings they have accrued.|$|R
6000|$|... "Patty," [...] he {{said once}} more, [...] "I shall <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> from you to-night,-- this evening; now, during this walk, or I shall return to-morrow, and never revisit this spot again." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, Rawdy, you've had an answer, for once. Usually {{you don't}} <b>get</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer,</b> you know--and that's why you go so far--in {{the things you}} say. Now you'll know how you make people feel." ...|$|E
40|$|Many {{libraries}} {{have taken}} reference questions via e-mail for years. In {{the case of}} e-mail, typically the patron sends an e-mail message asking their reference question and, whenever the next reference librarian gets time to check the e-mail, they respond to the question. The patron <b>gets</b> <b>an</b> <b>answer</b> to their question within 24 hours, if they have given the librarian sufficient in [...] formation from which to answer their original question...|$|R
