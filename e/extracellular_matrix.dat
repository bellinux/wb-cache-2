5|$|Connective tissues are fibrous {{and made}} up of cells {{scattered}} among inorganic material called the <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrix.</b> Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. The main types are loose connective tissue, adipose tissue, fibrous connective tissue, cartilage and bone. The <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrix</b> contains proteins, the chief and most abundant of which is collagen. Collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues. The matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body. An exoskeleton is a thickened, rigid cuticle which is stiffened by mineralization, as in crustaceans or by the cross-linking of its proteins as in insects. An endoskeleton is internal and present in all developed animals, {{as well as in}} many of those less developed.|$|E
5|$|Epithelial {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of closely packed cells, bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules, with little intercellular space. Epithelial cells can be squamous (flat), cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina, the upper layer of the basement membrane, the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrix</b> secreted by the epithelial cells. There are {{many different types of}} epithelium, modified to suit a particular function. In the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi. Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body. Keratinocytes make up to 95% of the cells in the skin. The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrix</b> {{in the form of a}} cuticle. In simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins. In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells.|$|E
5|$|When {{neutrophils}} {{release their}} granule contents in the kidney, {{the contents of}} the granule (reactive oxygen compounds and proteases) degrade the <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrix</b> of host cells and can cause damage to glomerular cells, affecting their ability to filter blood and causing changes in shape. In addition, phospholipase products (e.g., leukotrienes) intensify the damage. This release of substances promotes chemotaxis of more neutrophils to the site of infection, and glomerular cells can be damaged further by the adhesion molecules during the migration of neutrophils. The injury done to the glomerular cells can cause renal failure.|$|E

5|$|With a few exceptions, {{most notably}} the sponges (Phylum Porifera), animals have bodies {{differentiated}} into separate tissues. These include muscles, which are able to contract and control locomotion, and a nervous system, which sends and processes signals. There is also typically an internal digestive chamber. The eukaryotic cells possessed by all animals are surrounded by a characteristic <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrix</b> composed of collagen and elastic glycoproteins. This may be calcified to form structures like shells, bones, and spicules, a framework upon which cells can move about and be reorganized during development and maturation, and which supports the complex anatomy required for mobility.|$|E
5|$|Cells {{that stop}} {{dividing}} (post-mitotic) and differentiate into neurons early in cortical development {{are important in}} laying the groundwork on which other developing neurons can be guided to their proper destination. Tbr1 aids in neuronal migration in the early development of the cerebral cortex. It is largely expressed in post-mitotic neurons of the preplate, which forms a foundation upon which neurons are able to grow and move. As a transcription factor, Tbr1 modulates the expression of RELN, which encodes the Reln protein that forms part of the <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrix</b> of cells. Thus, through regulation of Reln expression, Tbr1 regulates {{the formation of the}} matrix through which neurons migrate. Without Tbr1, neurons fail to migrate properly.|$|E
5|$|Naked {{extracellular}} DNA (eDNA), {{most of it}} {{released by}} cell death, is nearly ubiquitous in the environment. Its concentration in soil may {{be as high as}} 2 μg/L, and its concentration in natural aquatic environments may be as high at 88 μg/L. Various possible functions have been proposed for eDNA: it may be involved in horizontal gene transfer; it may provide nutrients; and it may act as a buffer to recruit or titrate ions or antibiotics. Extracellular DNA acts as a functional <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrix</b> component in the biofilms of several bacterial species. It may act as a recognition factor to regulate the attachment and dispersal of specific cell types in the biofilm; it may contribute to biofilm formation; and it may contribute to the biofilm's physical strength and resistance to biological stress.|$|E
40|$|The {{experimental}} {{model of}} streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats was utilized {{to determine the}} biosynthetic and biochemical alterations in the proteoglycans of the glomerular <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrices</b> (glomerular basement membrane and mesangial matrix) in diabetic nephropathy. Isolated kidneys from diabetic and control groups of animals were radiolabeled in an organ perfusion apparatus with [35 S]sulfate of high specific activity (greater than 1, 200 Ci/mmol; 1 Ci = 3. 7 x 10 (10) Bq) and processed for electron microscopic autoradiography, and the proteoglycans of the glomerular <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrices</b> were characterized. The results indicate that [35 S]sulfate incorporation into glomerular <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrices</b> of diabetic animals was 30 - 40 % {{less than that of}} the control group; however, no differences in the biochemical properties of the de novo synthesized proteoglycans from either group were observed. The relevance of the decreased de novo synthesis of sulfated proteoglycans of glomerular <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrices</b> is discussed in terms of increased glomerular permeability to plasma proteins and reduction in the glomerular filtration rate...|$|R

50|$|This layer {{consists}} of loose fibrous components and <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrices</b> {{that can be}} compared to soft gelatin. This layer is also known as Reinke’s space {{but it is not a}} space at all. Like the pleural cavity, it is a potential space. If there really is a space, there is a problem. The superficial layer of the lamina propria is a structure that vibrates a great deal during phonation, and the viscoelasticity needed to support this vibratory function depends mostly on <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrices.</b> The primary <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrices</b> of the vocal fold cover are reticular, collagenous and elastic fibers, as well as glycoprotein and glycosaminoglycan. These fibers serve as scaffolds for structural maintenance, providing tensile strength and resilience so that the vocal folds may vibrate freely but still retain their shape.|$|R
5|$|The {{triggers}} for precipitation of {{uric acid}} {{are not well}} understood. While it may crystallize at normal levels, {{it is more likely}} to do so as levels increase. Other triggers believed to be important in acute episodes of arthritis include cool temperatures, rapid changes in uric acid levels, acidosis, articular hydration and <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrix</b> proteins, such as proteoglycans, collagens and chondroitin sulfate. The increased precipitation at low temperatures partly explains why the joints in the feet are most commonly affected. Rapid changes in uric acid may occur due to factors including trauma, surgery, chemotherapy, diuretics and stopping or starting allopurinol. Calcium channel blockers and losartan are associated with a lower risk of gout compared to other medications for hypertension.|$|E

40|$|<b>Extracellular</b> <b>matrices</b> (ECMs) play an {{important}} rote as components of basement membrane of normal human skin and in migrating epidermal cells in wound healing. We investigated the effects of various ECMs on human keratinocyte adhesion and growth {{as well as on}} its secretion and deposition of fibronectin (FN) in vitro using a serum-tree, low-calcium culture system. Since cell adhesion is the first step of cell growth, we performed cell adhesion assay for 14 h. Human keratinocytes adhered best on FN and less well on types I/III collagen, type IV collagen, and heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) as compared with bovine serum albumin (BSA) (control) or laminin (La). Cell growth assayed for 7 - 8 days on the dishes coated with various <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrices</b> revealed significantly increased keratinocyte growth on FN and on types I/III collagen in comparison with that on type IV collagen, HSPG, BSA (control), or La. Morphology of keratinocytes and of their colonies on FN and types I/III collagen was strikingly {{different from that of the}} control; the colonies were not so compact as in the control, but rather loose and larger; each keratinocyte was spread out more on these substrata. These morphologic features seemed to correlate with the increased keratinocyte growth on these <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrices.</b> Both immunofluorescence study for FN with keratinocytes in 8 -day culture on various <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrices</b> and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for FN measurement on substratum or in conditioned medium with keratinocytes in 5 -day culture demonstrated that <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrices</b> modulated the secretion and deposition of FN by human keratinocytes in culture; the keratinocyte growth correlated with the amount of FN detected on substratum but not with that in medium. Based on the results of the present investigation, we think that the growth of human keratinocytes depends on the amount of FN on substratum...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this study}} was to explore and {{evaluate}} biotubes consisting of autologous tissues. The biotubes were prepared by intra-abdominally embedding silicon rods as moulds. The specimens were analyzed by mechanical tests, histological observation and superficial study. The intra-abdominal implantation of the silicone tubes readily stimulated the development of the biotubes. The biotubes consisted of collagen-rich <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrices.</b> Myofibroblasts appeared as elongated cells with circumferential or longitudinal orienta-tions. Subsequent to one month of embedding, the thickness of the tube wall was 70 - 250 µm. The burst strength was 1100 ± 187 mmHg and the suturability was excellent. Biotubes that have the ability to be widely variable in their shapes are composed of autologous cells and glomerular <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrices.</b> Biotubes are ideal grafts for tissue engineering as they are able to avoid immunological rejection and are of sufficient mechanical strength...|$|R

25|$|Urokinase, {{also known}} as urokinase-type {{plasminogen}} activator (uPA), is a serine protease present in humans and other animals. The human urokinase protein was discovered, but not named, by McFarlane and Pilling in 1947. Urokinase was originally isolated from human urine, {{and it is also}} present in the blood and in the <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrix</b> of many tissues. The primary physiological substrate of this enzyme is plasminogen, which is an inactive form (zymogen) of the serine protease plasmin. Activation of plasmin triggers a proteolytic cascade that, depending on the physiological environment, participates in thrombolysis or <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrix</b> degradation. This cascade had been involved in vascular diseases and cancer progression.|$|E
25|$|When the {{endothelium}} is damaged, {{the normally}} isolated, underlying collagen {{is exposed to}} circulating platelets, which bind directly to collagen with collagen-specific glycoprotein Ia/IIa surface receptors. This adhesion is strengthened further by von Willebrand factor (vWF), which is released from the endothelium and from platelets; vWF forms additional links between the platelets' glycoprotein Ib/IX/V and the collagen fibrils. This localization of platelets to the <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrix</b> promotes collagen interaction with platelet glycoprotein VI. Binding of collagen to glycoprotein VI triggers a signaling cascade that results in activation of platelet integrins. Activated integrins mediate tight binding of platelets to the <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrix.</b> This process adheres platelets {{to the site of}} injury.|$|E

40|$|The {{inflammatory}} response requires the adhesion of multiple leukocyte types with other leukocytes, <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrices</b> {{and with other}} cell types. Leukocytes must adhere to vascular endothelial cells and to <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrices</b> in order to migrate from peripheral circulation to sites of inflammation. T lymphocytes must adhere to class II-positive antigen presenting cells in order to initiate a cascade of events that leads to T cell activation, allowing the T cell to provide help in both the generation of the antibody response and the generation of cytotoxic T cells (CTL). Also effector leukocytes such as NK cells, CTL or granulocytes must adhere to appropriate target cells such as virally infected cells, tumor cells or cells from transplanted allogeneic organs. This adherence both stimulates the leukocyte to perform lytic functions and allows local concentrations of lytic mediators secreted from the effector leukocyte to accumulate at the leukocyte/target cell junction...|$|R
40|$|Osteoblastic {{differentiation}} is {{an essential}} part of bone formation that compensates resorbed bone matrix to maintain its structural integrity. Cells in an osteoblast lineage develop differentiated phenotypes during a long-term culture in vitro. However, intrinsic mechanisms whereby these cells differentiate into mature osteoblasts are yet unclear. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) stimulate osteoblastic differentiation and bone formation. We demonstrate that mouse osteoblastic MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells constitutively expressed messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for BMP- 2 and BMP- 4 and accumulated BMPs in collagen-rich <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrices.</b> BMPs associated with the <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrices</b> were involved in the induction of osteoblastic differentiation of nonosteogenic mesenchymal cells as well as cells in the osteoblast lineage. MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells constitutively expressed type IA and type II BMP receptors. When a kinase-deficient type IA BMP receptor was stably transfected to MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells to obliterate BMP- 2 / 4 signaling, these cells not only failed to respond to exogenous BMP- 2 but lost their capability of differentiation into osteoblasts that form mineralized nodules. These observations strongly suggest that endogenous BMP- 2 / 4 accumulated in <b>extracellular</b> <b>matrices</b> are essential for the osteoblastic differentiation of cells in the osteoblast lineage. Therefore, the regulatory mechanism of BMP- 2 / 4 actions in osteoblastic cells is a principal issue to be elucidated for better understanding of pathogenesis of bone losing diseases such as osteoporosis...|$|R

Ligand binding to the extracellular domain of integrins changes the protein's conformation, clustering it at the cell membrane to initiate signal transduction. Integrins lack kinase activity; hence, integrin-mediated signal transduction is achieved through a variety of intracellular protein kinases and adaptor molecules, the main coordinator being integrin-linked kinase. As shown in the adjacent picture, cooperative integrin-RTK signaling determines the timing of cellular survival, apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation.|$|E

40|$|Macrophages, which secrete {{proteolytic}} enzymes {{capable of}} hydrolyzing elastin, collagen, and glycoproteins, {{may play a}} prominent role in the turnover of connective tissue macromolecules at inflammatory sites.
