5|$|Those {{accustomed}} to making repairs on solid state equipment are cautioned that vacuum tube gear contain potentially lethal voltages. The practice of discharging power-supply capacitors and keeping one hand {{in your pocket}} when working on powered-up gear are essential safety measures. Some older equipment directly connects the metal chassis {{to one side of}} the incoming AC line, a practice which results in the entire unit becoming electrified if the wall plug is inserted backwards. Many older radios, such as vintage receivers, are not safety-fused. Restorers generally replace the AC line cord with a more modern 3 wire plug and install an in-line or chassis mount <b>fuseholder.</b> The use of a common station ground connection to all equipment is encouraged. Those who collect, restore or otherwise use vintage radio equipment should also be aware of possible radioactive substances.|$|E
25|$|Fuses for {{low voltage}} power {{circuits}} may have bolted blade or tag terminals which are secured by screws to a <b>fuseholder.</b> Some blade-type terminals {{are held by}} spring clips. Blade type fuses often {{require the use of}} a special purpose extractor tool to remove them from the fuse holder.|$|E

50|$|Medical devices {{can and do}} take {{advantage}} of power entry modules. Power entry modules are available with electromagnetic interference filters with very low leakage current ratings, even those suitable for direct patient contact in accordance with UL 544 and IEC 60601-1. Shock-safe <b>fuseholders</b> have also been integrated into power entry modules. These devices require a tool to remove the fuse for replacement.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fuseholders</b> may {{be secured}} by screws to a panel, {{attached}} to bus bars, or mounted on DIN rails. For the Neozed fuses, {{there are also}} fuse bases with integrated disconnecting switches. Changing fuses with the circuit off increases {{the safety of the}} user. With new versions of these load disconnecting switches, the fuse cartridges are no longer screwed, but are held by spring clips.|$|R
50|$|Fuse Boxes {{normally}} use cartridge or rewirable fuses with {{no other}} protective device, and basic 4-ways boxes are very common. Some older boxes are made of brown-black bakelite, sometimes with a wooden base. Although their design is historic, these were standard equipment for new installs {{as recently as the}} 1980s, so they are very common. <b>Fuseholders</b> in these boxes may not provide protection from accidental contact with live terminals.|$|R
40|$|Technique {{involves}} modifying <b>fuseholder</b> {{cap with}} drilled hole to allow each circuit {{to be connected}} to automatic circuit analyzer. Tester is commercially-available continuity device used for checking out wiring harnesses that sequentially steps from one circuit to the next automatically. Test results are printed...|$|E
50|$|The Schurter Group {{was founded}} in Lucerne in 1933 by Heinrich Schurter with funding from his mother and mother-in-law, {{during the time of}} the Great Depression. The company got its start {{producing}} fuse cartridges, screw heads and set screws. Heinrich's son Rolf joined the company in the 1940s to help manage the accounting and bookkeeping. <b>Fuseholders</b> were added to the product line in 1944, and the company's first catalog was printed. During the 1940s Schurter products began to be listed in reseller's catalogs. The company moved to its current facilities established at Werkhofstrasse 8 in 1948. The company was transformed into a limited liability company in 1949. In 1964 the company had grown to 194 employees. By 1968, component sales amounted to two-thirds of Schurter's business due to increasing exports. Hienrich Schurter died that year. Schurter GmbH was established in Endingen, Germany in 1971 under Managing Director Kaspar Egli, who came from Lucerne to run the business.|$|R
