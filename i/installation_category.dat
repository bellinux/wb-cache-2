40|$|Conventional {{method of}} maximum demand {{determination}} of a multi <b>category</b> bulk electrical <b>installation</b> at planning stage {{is done by}} using several rules of thumb, in which maximum demand and time at which maximum demand occurs cannot be estimated accurately. This incorrect maximum demand estimation caused for wrong transformer and backup power capacity estimation, wrong cable and switchgear selection, inefficient performance of transformer, incorrect statistics, etc. In this research, a methodology is proposed to determine the maximum demand of multi <b>category</b> bulk electrical <b>installation</b> using its entire kVA profile. This entire kVA profile of multi <b>category</b> bulk electrical <b>installation</b> is generated through a database of kVA profiles in which averaged normalized kVA profile for each <b>installation</b> <b>categories</b> have been defined along with their electrical power loading characteristics. Multi <b>category</b> bulk electrical <b>installation</b> {{can be considered as}} a combination of several single <b>category</b> bulk electrical <b>installations.</b> Hence, to determine the entire kVA profile of a multi <b>category</b> bulk electrical <b>installation,</b> averaged normalized common kVA profiles which represent each category will be added together with multiplying them by their individual calculated maximum demand. To compile the database of averaged normalized common kVA profiles, kVA profiles (each contains kVA values of one month logging period with 15 minute intervals) of 500 numbers of single <b>category</b> bulk electrical <b>installations</b> have been considered as the sample. The sample is preprocessed, normalized and then clustered using Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm. By using square sum of error of each clusters and Knee point criterion, seventeen numbers of unique kVA pattern classes were identified. Then averaged normalized kVA profiles were derived for each pattern class and map them up with example single <b>category</b> bulk electrical <b>installations</b> and their characteristics to compile above said averaged normalized kVA profile database. Visual basic programming and Matlab software is used to execute above said research work. This proposed methodology has been verified considering a multi <b>category</b> electrical <b>installation</b> and proposed methodology can be considered as an acceptable one to determine the maximum demand of multi <b>category</b> bulk electrical <b>installations.</b> This methodology can be further improved by compiling averaged normalized kVA profile database for each <b>installation</b> <b>categories</b> separately. Additionally, this research can be further improved as a required tool for load forecasting, demand-side management, system planning, distribution system loss estimation and better tariff design, etc...|$|R

5000|$|Instead of {{following}} the Fast Ethernet standard for twisted pair cabling {{by using only}} 2 pairs of wires, 100VG-AnyLAN used all four pairs in either Category 3 or Category 5 twisted pair cable.

This had the additional advantage of being less susceptible to external sources of RF interference such as other network cables, fluorescent lights, and high power lines.

This presented a problem with early installations that borrowed one unused twisted pair for telephone traffic but those installations were uncommon.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Some wikis support virtual {{communities}} that are built around the wiki itself (e. g., Wikipedia).

As part of the [...] "Greater Bristol Strategic Transport Study", a link road is under consideration to the south of Bristol.

40|$|Air quality {{management}} in South Africa has undergone significant legislative reform in recent years, {{aimed at improving}} air quality within South Africa. The National Environmental Management: Air Quality Act 39 was promulgated in 2005 and makes provision for various instruments to improve ambient air quality. One such instrument is minimum emission standards, limiting the emissions from industrial point sources. The standards were first set in 2010, but were subsequently amended in 2013. These standards have been set for various industry sectors and require facilities to comply with one set of emission standards by 2015 and a stricter set of standards by 2020, dependent on the commissioning date of the facility. In setting the standards, the costs of compliance and expected ambient benefit of compliance were only indirectly assessed. Subsequent to the promulgation of the standards, various industries have indicated {{that not all of}} the standards were feasible through various applications for the postponement of these standards. The effect of such a postponement will be to delay compliance with the emission standards, resulting in the intended ambient air quality benefits not being realised. The purpose of the investigation was to assess the desirability of implementation of the standards from an environmental as well as economic point of view. Due to the scope of such a study and the variety of industries involved, the investigation was limited to a single set of standards. The research assessed compliance with the Category 1. 1 standards (solid fuel combustion installations used primarily for steam raising or electricity generation with a design capacity greater than 50 MW) for sulphur dioxide (SO 2) emissions as the majority of installations falling into this category have indicated that compliance with the SO 2 emission standard will not be achieved within the required timeframe. A review of environmental evaluation techniques was done {{in order to determine the}} most appropriate method to assess the economic desirability of the legislation, taking into consideration the expected benefit of implementation as well as the costs and impacts of implementing the required abatement technology to reach the standards. The study used a bottoms-up or impact pathway approach to analyse the impact of emission reduction. The costs and benefits associated with the implementation of an SO 2 point source standard of 500 mg/Nm 3 for solid fuel combustion <b>installations</b> (<b>Category</b> 1. 1 sources) was evaluated to determine the net present value of SO 2 regulation on the Mpumalanga Highveld of South Africa. All category 1. 1 sources within the study area expected to have a significant impact on ambient SO 2 concentrations were included in the study. An evaluation of the likely technology to be implemented to reach the new plant (2020) SO 2 emission standard of 500 mg/Nm 3 was conducted and the installation of wet flue gas desulfurisation (FGD) was determined to be the technology of choice. In order to conduct the economic valuation, the costs and benefits associated with the installation of FGD was identified and ranked into four categories, based on the expected impact and the availability of information. All costs and benefits that could be quantified and monetized (Category 1 impacts) were included in the evaluation.

40|$|European Union {{citizenship}}, {{as a form}} {{of citizenship}} beyond the nation state, entails the promise of the formation of a heterogeneous and democratic European public, empowering citizens and ethnic residents. Notwithstanding this promise, the 1996 intergovernmental conference that culminated in the Treaty of Amsterdam (signed on 2 October 1997) did not extend the personal scope of Union citizenship to include long?term resident third country nationals. Other substantive reforms, however, such as the inclusion of an anti?discrimination clause, the institutionalisation of the right to information, the strengthening of democratic accountability and the enhanced respect for human rights, all improve the rights of citizens, and ethnic migrant residents and members of other disadvantaged groups generally.

40|$|Options for air {{compliance}} through {{pollution prevention}} (P 2) {{have been identified}} at 14 facilities of the US Air Force Materiel Command, ranging from depots with significant light industrial activity to laboratories. Previous P 2 efforts concentrated on reducing hazardous and solid wastes, with any reduction in air impacts generally being a collateral benefit. This work focused on reducing air emissions and air compliance vulnerabilities. P 2 options were identified in three stages. First, potentially applicable P 2 options were identified from Internet and published information. Attention was given to identifying the types of sources to which an option could be applied, the option's state of development, and constraints that could limit its application. Traditional P 2 options involving technology or equipment changes and material substitution were considered. In addition, newer approaches based on administrative ''controls'' were considered. These included inserting P 2 into operating permits in exchange for administrative relief, privatization, derating boilers, and reducing an installation's potential to emit and compliance vulnerability by separating sources not under the Air Force's ''common control. '' Next, criteria and toxic emissions inventories by source category were prepared from inventory data supplied by facilities. The major problems at this stage were differences in the levels of detail provided by facilities and in the categories used by different <b>installations.</b> Emitting <b>categories</b> were matched to P 2 option categories to identify candidate options. Candidates were screened to account for local regulations and technical information about sources in the inventories. When possible, emission reductions were estimated to help facility personnel prioritize options. Some options identified are being actively pursued by facilities to determine their site-specific feasibility. Although much {{work has been done}} to implement material substitution programs, this work indicates that different priorities and additional opportunities might result from using air emissions and compliance vulnerability as driving metrics...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{favorable}} combination of weldability, strength, corrosion resistance and price, 13 Cr “Super {{martensitic stainless steel}} ” (SMSS) has been applied as flowline material for several projects in the North Sea. However, during the last years, some severe failures have taken place with SMSS flowlines. These failures may be sorted in three categories: 1) Failures of girth welds using 25 Cr super duplex stainless steel (SDSS) filler material detected during reeling. 2) Failures of girth welds using 13 Cr SMSS filler material detected during reeling installation. 3) Failures of flowlines detected during system pressure testing. Failures experienced with girth welds using SDSS filler material have previously been presented by Rørvik et al. [1]. The reported failures took place as fractures initiated in the girth weld heat affected zone (HAZ). Failures of girth welds with matching SMSS filler material have also occurred during reeling. This was by weld metal cracking initiated from inter-run lack of fusion (IRLOF) weld defects during reeling <b>installation.</b> The third <b>category</b> of failures was cracking detected during system pressure testing.

40|$|International audienceRiverbanks are characterised by {{high levels}} of both species-richness and anthropic pressure. Erosion {{controls}} on riverbanks often involve installations to protect human investments (i. e. buildings, public amenitiesetc.). However, whether such installations can accommodate natural biodiversity has not been well assessed and subsequently seldom {{taken into account in}} the choice of technique. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess animal and plant species diversity on the natural gradient of various riverbank protection systems, from entirely stone riprap, through combined constructions (mixing riprap and bioengineering), to purely vegetative bioengineering structures. We compared plant species diversity and animal taxonomic diversity above ground (beetles) and below ground (mites) on five <b>installations</b> in each <b>category.</b> Vegetation was sampled along three longitudinal transects using the point contact method. Fauna were sampled in the soil, air and herbaceous layers by trapping (yellow bowl trap, pitfalls and Berlese-Tullgren extractor). The fifteen sites sampled were located in the Rhône-Alpes region (South East France). 148 plant species, 78 beetle genera and 8 mite families were recorded. We found a significantly lower animal and plant diversity in riprap constructions than in the other two types. Surprisingly, diversity was higher, even if not significantly, in combined works than in purely vegetative ones. Furthermore, riprap techniques were more subject to exotic invasions than techniques using bioengineering. This study gives new insights into the animal and plant biodiversity of riverbank protections against erosion, ranging from entirely mineral to purely vegetative constructions. It also provides useful information to help practitioners choose techniques in relation to their future impact on biodiversity...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{business}} benefits for capital goods manufacturers in maintaining systematic records for individual products in their installed base. The research {{results show that}} such installed base information can be essential for a company interested in improving both the value their customers get from using their products and their after-sales operations' profitability. Although companies have product-related records on their sales, production, deliveries, service contracts, and service jobs, the data in the often function-specific information systems remain incompatible, and {{an overview of the}} installed base is missing. The resulting situation resembles that of manufacturing before ERP systems were introduced to unify function-specific transaction data in the manufacturing process. Whereas the ERP systems for production have been powerful in standardizing transaction data involving product and component types, the value for customers after the sale is created through product individuals. To implement information systems focusing on individual products, it is necessary to understand which functions are interested in such information and what data should be standardized and gathered. The research's main objective was to improve understanding of the reasons for maintaining installed base information and understanding of the installed base information's structure. The research's empirical part consists of four in-depth case studies in four capital goods manufacturing companies providing product-related services. In each case study, the focal company developed its installed base information systems. Consequently, several purposes for installed base information were identified towards providing customer value during the product use, both through ensuring the products' operational reliability and through supporting the customer's goals with the products. Ensuring product reliability for the customer requires that service units be prepared for servicing the individual products in their area and that the company can identify and resolve production and design problems with their products. Supporting the customers' goals requires that sales and product development can adjust the customer offers to differences among customer applications as well as changes in the customers' operations. At the same time, after-sales operations' profitability can be improved through adjusting investments in service resources and service pricing based on the serviced products. Further, analyses of the installed products and the after-sales service operations support identifying performance problems with products, services, or customer contracts decreasing after-sales service profitability and requiring corrective actions. The research revealed three main categories of information needed to support the above purposes: information on the individual products, information on the customer site where the product is installed, and information on the service events involving the product <b>installations.</b> These information <b>categories</b> enable analyses involving products, customer applications, and their performance over time...|$|R
