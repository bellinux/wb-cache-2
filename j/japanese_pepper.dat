The company {{is based in}} Beverly Hills, California, and is committed to producing films that touch the consciences and hearts of people. The company released its debut film Bella directed by Alejandro Gomez Monteverde and starring Verástegui. The latest project of the company is Little Boy written by Alejandro Monteverde and Pepe Portillo. Starring Emily Watson, Kevin James, David Henrie, Jacob Salvati, Ben Chaplin, and set in 1945, it {{tells the story of}} Pepper, an eight-year-old who does all he can to be reunited with his father, a soldier fighting in World War II and captured by the <b>Japanese.</b> Meanwhile, <b>Pepper</b> has to befriend Hashimoto, a Japanese man living in his town.|$|R

While red chili pepper is never used on eel, otherwise, in many usages, the Japanese red chili pepper, or the shichimi blend of peppers {{can be used}} in lieu of <b>Japanese</b> <b>pepper</b> alone, according to taste: e.g., to flavor miso soup, various noodles in broth or dipped in , Japanese pickles (tsukemono), teriyaki or fried chicken.|$|E
50|$|Vella Gulf {{departed}} Pearl Harbor on 9 July, {{stopped at}} Eniwetok in the Marshalls on 16 July to refuel, and proceeded on to Guam, where she arrived four days later. On 23 July, she sailed for the Marianas to conduct {{air strikes against}} Rota and Pagan Islands. The next day, she launched 24 sorties against Pagan Island with her Vought F4U Corsairs, Grumman F6F Hellcat photographic aircraft, and Grumman TBM Avenger bombers. Three days later, the escort carrier launched 21 sorties against Rota, with a dozen Corsairs, eight Avengers and one Hellcat taking part. Light anti-aircraft fire from <b>Japanese</b> guns <b>peppered</b> the skies but failed to reach the American planes. Two planes returned from the mission having conducted their attacks from such a low altitude that shrapnel from their own bomb explosions slightly damaged their tail surfaces.|$|R
50|$|At Saipan {{again on}} the 25th, Twining {{conducted}} shore bombardment off Mutcho Point. Throughout the remainder of June, she continued to operate off Saipan, providing shore bombardment, night harassment and illumination fire, as well as screening transports and engaging enemy aircraft. In Magicienne Bay early {{on the evening of}} the 28th, Twining, witnessed an impressive exchange of fire between marine units {{on the south side of}} the bay and Japanese on the north. Later in the evening, <b>Japanese</b> planes attacked, <b>peppering</b> seaward waters with bombs. Observers on board the destroyer watched as shore fire scored a hit on an enemy plane overhead; then saw the plane fall in flames some four miles away. Just before midnight on 30 June, as Twining patrolled off Nafutan Point, two enemy planes attempted to make runs on Aslito airfield but were turned back by heavy fire from the destroyer.|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} the epidemiological aspects of tobamovirus infecting the L resistance genotypes of green pepper, fifteen isolates {{were collected from}} geographically different fields and were chracterized by their biological properties. All isolates infected L 1 and L 2 plants systemically, but were localized in L 3 and L 4 plants. The symptomatology on several test plants and the reactivity to an antiserum showed that they were identical {{to that of a}} <b>Japanese</b> strain of <b>pepper</b> mild mottle virus (PMMoV-J). The viral infection was also confirmed by a reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with oligonucleotide primers that amplity the coat protein gene of PMMoV-RNA. On the other hand, the RT-PCR allowed us to detect PMMoV in seeds of some commercial cultivars of green pepper. Viruses isolated from the seeds could infect L 2 plants systemically. Further analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the predicted coat protein gene revealed that the isolates from the commercial seeds were identical to that of PMMoV-J. These results indicated that the L 2 resistance-breaking tobamovirus has prevailed in fields of green pepper in Japan. and that infected seeds {{may be one of the}} initial sources of the viral infection...|$|R

50|$|Kushiyaki {{seasonings}} {{are primarily}} divided among two types: salty or salty-sweet. The salty type usually uses plain salt as its main seasoning. For the salty-sweet variety, tare, a special sauce consisting of mirin, sake, soy sauce, and sugar is used. Other common spices include powdered cayenne pepper, shichimi, <b>Japanese</b> <b>pepper,</b> black pepper, karashi and wasabi, according to one's tastes.|$|E
50|$|Piper {{species have}} a pantropical distribution, and are most {{commonly}} found in the understory of lowland tropical rainforests, but can also occur in clearings and in higher elevation life zones such as cloud forests; one species (<b>Japanese</b> <b>Pepper,</b> P. kadsura, from southern Japan and southernmost Korea) is subtropical and can tolerate light winter frost. Peppers are often dominant species where they are found.|$|E

5000|$|Zanthoxylum piperitum, called <b>Japanese</b> <b>pepper,</b> chopi, or Korean {{pepper in}} English and sanshō (山椒) in Japanese, is a {{deciduous}} aromatic spiny shrub or small tree, {{belonging to the}} Rutaceae (citrus and rue) family. Natural range spans from Hokkaido to Kyushu in Japan, southern parts of the Korean peninsula, and Chinese mainland. The related Z. schinifolium (イヌザンショウ pron. inuzanshō, lit., [...] "dog sansho") occurs {{as far south as}} Yakushima, attaining a height of 3 meters.|$|E
5000|$|When threatened, these {{salamanders}} can excrete a strong-smelling, milky substance with an odor resembling <b>Japanese</b> <b>pepper</b> (hence its common Japanese name, giant pepper fish). It {{has very}} poor eyesight, and possesses special sensory cells covering its skin, running {{from head to}} toe, the lateral line system. These sensory cells' hair-like shapes detect minute vibrations in the environment, and are quite similar to the hair cells of the human inner ear. This feature is essential for its hunting because of its poor eyesight.|$|E

5000|$|Unadon (an {{abbreviation}} for unagi + donburi, literally [...] "eel bowl") is a dish originating in Japan. It {{consists of a}} donburi type large bowl filled with steamed white rice, and topped with fillets of eel (unagi) grilled in a style known as kabayaki, similar to teriyaki. The fillets are glazed with a sweetened soy-based sauce, called tare and caramelized, preferably over charcoal fire. The fillets are not flayed, and the grayish skin side is placed faced down. Sufficient tare sauce is poured over so that some of it seeps through the rice underneath. By convention, pulverized dried berries of sanshō (called <b>Japanese</b> <b>pepper,</b> although botanically unrelated) are sprinkled on top as seasoning.|$|E
40|$|The Japanese {{traditional}} medicine daikenchuto (TU- 100) has anti-inflammatory activities, but the mechanisms remain incompletely understood. TU- 100 includes ginger, ginseng, and <b>Japanese</b> <b>pepper,</b> each component possessing bioactive properties. The effects of TU- 100 and individual components were investigated {{in a model}} of intestinal T lymphocyte activation using anti-CD 3 antibody. To determine contribution of intestinal bacteria, specific pathogen free (SPF) and germ free (GF) mice were used. TU- 100 or its components were delivered by diet or by gavage. Anti-CD 3 antibody increased jejunal accumulation of fluid, increased TNFa, and induced intestinal epithelial apoptosis in both SPF and GF mice, which was blocked by either TU- 100 or ginger, but not by ginseng or <b>Japanese</b> <b>pepper.</b> TU- 100 and ginger also blocked anti-CD 3 -stimulated Akt and NF-kB activation. A co-culture system of colonic Caco 2 BBE and Jurkat- 1 cells {{was used to examine}} T-lymphocyte/epithelial cells interactions. Jurkat- 1 cells were stimulated with anti-CD 3 to produce TNFa that activates epithelial cell NF-kB. TU- 100 and ginger blocked anti-CD 3 antibody activation of Akt in Jurkat cells, decreasing their TNFa production. Additionally, TU- 100 and ginger alone blocked direct TNFa stimulation of Caco 2 BBE cells and decrease...|$|E
40|$|Zanthoxylum fruit, {{obtained}} from the <b>Japanese</b> <b>pepper</b> plant (Zanthoxylum piperitum De Candolle), and its extract (Zanthoxylum fruit extract, ZFE) have multiple physiological activities (e. g., antiviral activity). However, the potential anticancer activity of ZFE has not been fully examined. In this study, we investigated the ability of ZFE to induce autophagic cell death (ACD). ZFE caused remarkable autophagy-like cytoplasmic vacuolization, inhibited cell proliferation, and ultimately induced cell death in the human cancer cell lines DLD- 1, HepG 2, and Caco- 2, but not in A 549, MCF 7, or WiDr cells. ZFE increased the level of LC 3 -II protein, a marker of autophagy. Knockdown of ATG 5 using siRNA inhibited ZFE-induced cytoplasmic vacuolization and cell death. Moreover, in cancer cells that could be induced to undergo cell death by ZFE, the extract increased the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and the JNK inhibitor SP 600125 attenuated both vacuolization and cell death. Based on morphology and expression of marker proteins, ZFE-induced cell death was neither apoptosis nor necrosis. Normal intestinal cells were not affected by ZFE. Taken together, our findings show that ZFE induces JNK-dependent ACD, {{which appears to be}} the main mechanism underlying its anticancer activity, suggesting a promising starting point for anticancer drug development...|$|E
