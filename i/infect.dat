5|$|Up to 60 {{helminth}} {{species are}} known to <b>infect</b> foxes in fur farms, while 20 are known in the wild. Several coccidian species of the genera Isospora and Eimeria are also known to <b>infect</b> them. The most common nematode species found in fox guts are Toxocara canis and Uncinaria stenocephala, Capillaria aerophila and Crenosoma vulpis, the latter two <b>infect</b> their lungs. Capillaria plica <b>infect</b> the fox's bladder. Trichinella spiralis rarely affects them. The most common tapeworm species in foxes are Taenia spiralis and T.pisiformis. Others include Echinococcus granulosus and E.multilocularis. Eleven trematode species <b>infect</b> red foxes, including Metorchis conjunctus.|$|E
5|$|Viruses {{are by far}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} biological entities on Earth and they outnumber all the others put together. They <b>infect</b> all types of cellular life including animals, plants, bacteria and fungi. However, different types of viruses can <b>infect</b> only a limited range of hosts and many are species-specific. Some, such as smallpox virus for example, can <b>infect</b> only one species – in this case humans, and are said to have a narrow host range. Other viruses, such as rabies virus, can <b>infect</b> different species of mammals and are said to have a broad range. The viruses that <b>infect</b> plants are harmless to animals, and most viruses that <b>infect</b> other animals are harmless to humans. The host range of some bacteriophages is limited to a single strain of bacteria and they can be used to trace the source of outbreaks of infections by a method called phage typing.|$|E

30|$|In the SI model, a node can be <b>infected</b> only by its <b>infected</b> neighbors. Therefore, all <b>infected</b> nodes are {{connected}} to the source node through at least one path that consists of <b>infected</b> nodes, i.e., at least one path (via the source node) exists between every pair of <b>infected</b> nodes. This means that all <b>infected</b> nodes are in one connected component.|$|R

5|$|Viruses <b>infect</b> all {{cellular}} life and, although viruses occur universally, each cellular {{species has}} its own specific range that often <b>infect</b> only that species.

5|$|A {{virus is}} a small {{infectious}} agent that replicates only inside the living cells of other organisms. Viruses can <b>infect</b> all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea.|$|E
5|$|Attachment is {{the binding}} {{of the virus}} to {{specific}} molecules {{on the surface of}} the cell. This specificity restricts the virus to a very limited type of cell. For example, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects only human T cells, because its surface protein, gp120, can only react with CD4 and other molecules on the T cell's surface. Plant viruses can only attach to plant cells and cannot <b>infect</b> animals. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that only <b>infect</b> cells in which they are capable of reproducing.|$|E

50|$|Mosquitoes, {{primarily}} from the genus Culex, become <b>infected</b> by feeding on birds <b>infected</b> with the Saint Louis encephalitis virus. <b>Infected</b> mosquitoes then transmit the Saint Louis encephalitis virus to humans and animals during the feeding process. The Saint Louis encephalitis virus grows both in the <b>infected</b> mosquito and the <b>infected</b> bird, but does not make either one sick. Only <b>infected</b> mosquitoes can transmit Saint Louis encephalitis virus. Once a human has been <b>infected</b> with the virus it is not transmissible from that individual to other humans.|$|R

40|$|Bootstrap {{percolation}} {{is a type}} {{of cellular}} automaton on graphs, introduced as a simple model of the dynamics of ferromagnetism. Vertices in a graph can be in one of two states: `healthy' or `infected' and from an initial configuration of states, healthy vertices become <b>infected</b> by local rules. While the usual bootstrap processes are monotone in the sets of <b>infected</b> vertices, in this paper, a modification is examined in which <b>infected</b> vertices can return to a healthy state. Vertices are initially <b>infected</b> independently at random and the central question is whether all vertices eventually become <b>infected.</b> The model examined here is such a process on a square grid for which healthy vertices with at least two <b>infected</b> neighbours become <b>infected</b> and <b>infected</b> vertices with no <b>infected</b> neighbours become healthy. Sharp thresholds are given for the critical probability of initial infections for all vertices eventually to become <b>infected.</b> Comment: 45 page...|$|R

5|$|Nearly 200 {{parasitic}} Plasmodium {{species have}} been identified that <b>infect</b> birds, reptiles, and other mammals, and about 30 species naturally <b>infect</b> non-human primates. Some malaria parasites that affect non-human primates (NHP) serve as model organisms for human malarial parasites, such as P.coatneyi (a model for P.falciparum) and P.cynomolgi (P.vivax). Diagnostic techniques used to detect parasites in NHP {{are similar to those}} employed for humans. Malaria parasites that <b>infect</b> rodents are widely used as models in research, such as P.berghei. Avian malaria primarily affects species of the order Passeriformes, and poses a substantial threat to birds of Hawaii, the Galapagos, and other archipelagoes. The parasite P.relictum is known {{to play a role in}} limiting the distribution and abundance of endemic Hawaiian birds. Global warming is expected to increase the prevalence and global distribution of avian malaria, as elevated temperatures provide optimal conditions for parasite reproduction.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} dwarf {{mistletoe}} (Arceuthobium americanum Nutt. ex. Engelm.) {{on the wood}} properties of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl.) were studied.

5|$|Rotaviruses <b>infect</b> {{the young}} of {{many species of}} animals {{and they are a}} major cause of {{diarrhoea}} in wild and reared animals worldwide. As a pathogen of livestock, notably in young calves and piglets, rotaviruses cause economic loss to farmers because of costs of treatment associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. These rotaviruses are a potential reservoir for genetic exchange with human rotaviruses. There is evidence that animal rotaviruses can <b>infect</b> humans, either by direct transmission of the virus or by contributing one or several RNA segments to reassortants with human strains.|$|E

5|$|Until the 1950s, {{screening}} of anti-malarial drugs {{was carried out}} on avian malaria. Avian malaria species differ from those that <b>infect</b> humans. The discovery in 1948 of Plasmodium berghei in wild rodents in the Congo and later other rodent species that could <b>infect</b> laboratory rats transformed drug development. The short hepatic phase and life cycle of these parasites made them useful as animal models, a status they still retain. Plasmodium cynomolgi in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) {{were used in the}} 1960s to test drugs active against P. vivax.|$|E
40|$|Differences in the {{relative}} abundance of dinucleotides, if any may provide important clues on host-driven evolution of viruses. We studied dinucleotide frequencies of large DNA viruses <b>infecting</b> vertebrates (n = 105; viruses <b>infecting</b> mammals = 99; viruses <b>infecting</b> aves = 6; viruses <b>infecting</b> reptiles = 1) and invertebrates (n = 88; viruses <b>infecting</b> insects = 84; viruses <b>infecting</b> crustaceans = 4). We have identified systematic depletion of CpT(ApG) dinucleotides and over-representation of CpG dinucleotides as the unique genomic signature of large DNA viruses <b>infecting</b> invertebrates. Detailed investigation of this unique genomic signature suggests the existence of invertebrate host-induced pressures specifically targeting CpT(ApG) and CpG dinucleotides. The depletion of CpT dinucleotides among large DNA viruses <b>infecting</b> invertebrates is at least in part, explained by non-canonical DNA methylation by the <b>infected</b> host. Our findings highlight the role of invertebrate host-related factors in shaping virus evolution and they also provide the necessary framework {{for future studies on}} evolution, epigenetics and molecular biology of viruses <b>infecting</b> this group of hosts...|$|R

40|$|Several {{hymenopteran}} parasitoids are <b>infected</b> with parthenogenesis-inducing (PI) Wolbachia. <b>Infected</b> wasps produce daughters {{instead of}} sons from unfertilized eggs. Thus far, {{little is known}} about the direct effects of PI Wolbachia on their host's fitness. Here, we report reduced competitive ability due to Wolbachia infection in a minute parasitoid wasp, Trichogramma kaykai Pinto and Stouthamer (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae). Immature survival of <b>infected</b> individuals in a host parasitized by a single <b>infected</b> female, laying a normal clutch of eggs, was lower than those parasitized by a single uninfected individual.

The survival rate of <b>infected</b> immatures was higher when they competed with other <b>infected</b> immatures from a different <b>infected</b> parent than in competition with uninfected immatures of conspecific wasps. Thus, the host Trichogramma can suffer a substantial reduction in fitness when it is <b>infected</b> with the PI Wolbachia.
