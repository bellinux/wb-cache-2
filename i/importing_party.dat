Chapter 19 of NAFTA {{addresses}} the Review and Dispute Settlement in Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Matters. Furthermore, article 1904 of NAFTA, addresses {{issues related to}} the Review of Final Antidumping and Countervailing Duty Determinations. The said article stipulates that an involved Party may request that a panel review, based on the administrative record, a final antidumping or countervailing duty determination of a competent investigating authority of an <b>importing</b> <b>Party.</b> The object of such review is to determine whether the determination was in accordance with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the <b>importing</b> <b>Party.</b> In order to review such determination, the panel shall apply the standard of review set out in Annex 1911 of NAFTA, and the general legal principles that a court of the <b>importing</b> <b>Party</b> otherwise would apply to review a determination of the competent investigating authority. Since these kinds of regulations are quite new in the Mexican legal system, the interpretation of the standard of review, has raised a lot of discussion among several panelists, governmental authorities and authors. Therefore, this paper will focus on the application and interpretation of the standard of review under NAFTA chapter 19, mainly by Mexican authorities...|$|E

50|$|The Protocol {{promotes}} biosafety {{by establishing}} {{rules and procedures}} for the safe transfer, handling, and use of LMOs, with specific focus on transboundary movements of LMOs.

Parties to the Protocol must ensure that LMOs are handled, packaged and transported under conditions of safety.

These procedures and requirements are designed to provide <b>importing</b> <b>Parties</b> with the necessary information needed for making informed decisions about whether or not to accept LMO imports and for handling them in a safe manner.|$|R

Appendix III includes all species which any Party identifies as being subject to regulation within its jurisdiction for the purpose of preventing or restricting exploitation, and as needing the cooperation of other Parties in the control of trade. Including the Great White Shark in Appendix III will require Australia to issue CITES permits to allow trade and require all other parties trading in the species to issue a Certificate of Origin. The requirement for permits to be issued and observed by <b>importing</b> <b>Parties</b> will assist Australia to regulate trade in specimens and enable all Parties to gain a greater understanding of trade in the species and any parts or derivatives of the species. The Great White Shark is a widely distributed species of coastal and offshore shelves in temperate and sub-tropical areas. It is thought to have local populations that show some evidence of migratory behaviour. It is a large (5 m) marine predator, vilified for its occasional attacks on humans. It is thought to have a low reproductive rate, reaching sexual maturity at 9 - 10 years of age and producing between two and ten pups after a 12 month gestation period once every two to three years. The species is relatively long-lived. The Great White Shark is uncommon compared to other sharks and evidence from protective beach netting i...|$|R

50|$|The {{two most}} {{prominent}} {{issues at the}} time of the by-election were Irish Home Rule and Tariff Reform. The issue of Home Rule was one that had split the Liberal Party back in 1886 with the Liberal Unionist's joining with the Conservatives to oppose it. The issue of Tariff reform was one that was currently dividing the Conservative Party, who had seen many of their Free Trade supporters leave to join the Liberals. Leading Liberal Unionist, Joseph Chamberlain had managed to persuade Conservative Prime Minister, Arthur Balfour and the party as a whole to support the introduction of trade tariffs on <b>imports.</b> The Liberal <b>Party</b> argued that these measures would increase the cost of food. Divisions within the government on this issue and others widened and on 4 December 1905, two days before polling day, the Conservative government of Arthur Balfour collapsed and he resigned as Prime Minister.

40|$|AbstractExisting {{buildings}} now {{represent the}} greatest opportunity to improve building energy efficiency. Building performance analysis {{is becoming increasingly}} important because decision makers can have a better visualization of their building's performance and quickly make the solution for improving building energy efficiency and reducing environmental impacts. Nowadays, building information models (BIMs) have been widely created during the design phase of new buildings, {{and it can be}} easily <b>imported</b> to third <b>party</b> software to conduct various analyses. However, a BIM is not always available for all existing buildings. Even if a BIM is available during the design and construction phases, it is very challenging to keep updating it while a building is aged. A manual process to create or update a BIM is very time consuming and labor intensive. A laser scanning technology has been a popular tool to create as-is BIM. However it still needs labor-intensive manual processes to create a BIM out of point clouds. This paper introduces automatic as-is simplified BIM creation from point clouds for energy simulations. A framework of decision support system that can assist decision makers on retrofits for existing buildings is introduced as well. A case study on a residential house was tested in this study to validate the proposed framework, and the technical feasibility of the developed system was positively demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|An Appendix II listing is {{proposed}} for the Malayan Giant Turtle (Orlitia borneensis); the species meets the criteria in Resolution Conf. 9. 24, as outlined below. Inclusion of Orlitia borneensis in CITES Appendix II is expected {{to result in a}} reduction in international trade in the species, as it affords greater control over <b>imports</b> in recipient <b>Parties</b> and is expected to lead to a higher level of scrutiny of trade levels and the status and biological data used to determine acceptable trade levels through non-detriment findings, quotas and other mechanisms. Listing will also result in jurisdiction over management of the species being shifted to the CITES MA in Indonesia and Malaysia. · Orlitia borneensis inhabits the lowland wetlands of Peninsular Malaysia, Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo), Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo) and Sumatra (Indonesia), namely rivers, estuaries, lakes, large vegetation-choked ponds and other large bodies of fresh water. Nesting occurs in loose soil, sandy riverbanks or piles of debris. No information is available on growth rate and age at maturity, and little on reproduction.

CBCT units reconstruct the projection data to provide interrelational images in three orthogonal planes (axial, sagittal, and coronal). In addition because reconstruction of CBCT data is performed natively using a personal computer, {{data can be}} reoriented in their true spatial relationships. Aims: To investigate accurate detection of the correct number of root canals in the mesio-buccal root of the maxillary molar teeth using 3 D imaging with cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) at different spatial resolution (isotropic voxel) settings. Methods: With IRB approval, 31 extracted maxillary molars were examined using high resolution, small field of view CBCT at isotropic voxel resolutions ranging at 0. 076, 0. 10 and 0. 20 mm. The image data sets were <b>imported</b> into third <b>party</b> segmentation software to provide 3 D videos for 8 observers {{to determine the number}} of mesio-buccal root canals in cross-sectional reconstructions. The ground truth was later established by sectioning the tooth roots axially. Results: Twenty-four of the teeth proved on sectioning to have two mesio-buccal canals whereas the others had one canal. Accuracy in detection of mesio-buccal canals varied between observers from 59 % to 75 % and statistically unrelated to observer experience. No statistical {{differences were found between the}} reconstructed 3 D images regarding accurate detection of canals. Conclusions: CBCT outperformed the findings for accuracy in detection of mesio-buccal root canals in all previous studies using 2 D imaging modalities and Tuned Aperture Computed Tomography.
