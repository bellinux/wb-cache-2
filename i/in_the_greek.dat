5|$|After adolescence, most {{physical}} training for males {{was of a}} military nature. The Campus Martius originally was an exercise field where young men developed the skills of horsemanship and warfare. Hunting was also considered an appropriate pastime. According to Plutarch, conservative Romans disapproved of Greek-style athletics that promoted a fine body for its own sake, and condemned Nero's efforts to encourage gymnastic games <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> manner.|$|E
5|$|Amis drew upon {{a holiday}} {{he had taken}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> islands to create a {{realistic}} Greek setting and characters. He emphasised political intrigue in the plot more than Fleming had done in the canonical Bond novels, also adding revenge to Bond's motivations by including M's kidnapping. Despite keeping a format and structure similar to Fleming's Bond novels, Colonel Sun was given mixed reviews.|$|E

5|$|Cicero {{translated}} Aratus in his youth; he {{made the}} Orion episode half again longer than it was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greek,</b> adding the traditional Latin topos of madness to Aratus's text. Cicero's Aratea {{is one of the}} oldest Latin poems to come down to us as more than isolated lines; this episode may have established the technique of including epyllia in non-epic poems.|$|E
5|$|Congregation Beth Israel in Meridian, Mississippi, is a Reform Jewish {{congregation}} {{founded in}} 1868 {{and a member}} of the Union for Reform Judaism. The congregation's first permanent house of worship was a Middle Eastern-style building constructed in 1879.

5|$|Following various {{military}} conquests <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> East, Romans adapted {{a number}} of Greek educational precepts to their own fledgling system. They began physical training to prepare the boys to grow as Roman citizens and for eventual recruitment into the army. Conforming to discipline was a point of great emphasis.

5|$|Koine Greek {{had become}} the common {{language}} of the eastern Mediterranean and into Asia Minor after the conquests of Alexander the Great. Lucian even imagines that Greek is the universal language of the dead in the underworld. In late antiquity, a Greek-speaking majority lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> peninsula and islands, major cities of the East, western Anatolia, and some coastal areas. Greek continued as {{the language of the}} Byzantine Empire, and developed into a distinctive medieval Greek that gave rise to modern Greek.|$|E
5|$|Latin {{writers were}} {{immersed}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> literary tradition, and adapted its forms {{and much of}} its content, but Romans regarded satire as a genre in which they surpassed the Greeks. Horace wrote verse satires before fashioning himself as an Augustan court poet, and the early Principate also produced the satirists Persius and Juvenal. The poetry of Juvenal offers a lively curmudgeon's perspective on urban society.|$|E
5|$|Maximus' {{work was}} {{translated}} by the 9th-century, Irish philosopher and mystical theologian Johannes Scotus Eriugena. In Eastern Christianity, Maximus {{has always been}} influential. The Eastern theologians Symeon the New Theologian and Gregory Palamas are seen as intellectual heirs to Maximus. Further, a number of Maximus' works are included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> Philokalia, a collection {{of some of the}} most influential Orthodox Christian writers.|$|E
50|$|One {{of these}} {{strategies}} was shown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> battle between <b>Greek</b> city states and Persia. The Battle of Thermopylae <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> forces were outnumbered stood as a good military strategy. <b>The</b> <b>Greek</b> allied forces ultimately lost the battle, but the training, use of armor, and location allowed them to defeat many Persian troops before losing. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> end, <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> alliance lost <b>the</b> battle but not the war {{as a result of}} that strategy which continued on to the battle of Plataea. The Battle of Plataea in 479 BC resulted in a victory for <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> against Persia, which exemplified that military strategy was extremely beneficial to defeating a numerous enemy.|$|R
50|$|After almost 600 {{years as}} part of the Roman Empire, the {{territory}} that is now Algeria was occupied by <b>the</b> Vandals <b>in</b> 428 AD. <b>In</b> 533-534, <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> general Belisarius defeated the Vandals, and Africa became a province of <b>the</b> Byzantine empire. <b>In</b> 535, <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> emperor Justinian I made Sicily a Byzantine province.|$|R

5|$|Most historians thus concur that chattel {{slaves were}} indeed used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> {{city-state}} of Sparta, at least after the Lacedemonian victory of 404 BC against Athens, {{but not in}} great numbers and only among the upper classes. As was in the other Greek cities, chattel slaves could be purchased at the market or taken in war.|$|E

5|$|Orion served several {{roles in}} ancient Greek culture. The {{story of the}} adventures of Orion, the hunter, is the one on which {{we have the most}} {{evidence}} (and even on that not very much); he is also the personification of the constellation of the same name; he was venerated as a hero, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> sense, in the region of Boeotia; and there is one etiological passage which says that Orion was responsible for the present shape of the Strait of Sicily.|$|E

50|$|The pogrom greatly {{accelerated}} emigration {{of ethnic}} Greeks from Turkey, and <b>the</b> Istanbul region <b>in</b> particular. <b>The</b> <b>Greek</b> population of Turkey declined from 119,822 persons in 1927, to about 7,000 in 1978. <b>In</b> Istanbul alone, <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> population decreased from 65,108 to 49,081 between 1955 and 1960.|$|R
5|$|Sea silk is a {{fine fabric}} woven from the byssus threads of bivalves, {{particularly}} the pen shell (Pinna nobilis). It used to be produced in the Mediterranean region where these shells are endemic. It was an expensive fabric and overfishing has much reduced populations of the pen shell. There is mention <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> text on the Rosetta Stone (196 BCE) of this cloth being used to pay taxes.|$|E

5|$|The first {{aviation}} units <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> Armed Forces {{were formed}} in June 1912. In the following Balkan Wars, the Hellenic Navy {{was the first}} in military history to use aircraft to track down and bomb the enemy fleet (1913). The Naval Air Service was officially established during the First World War and participated with the Allies in several missions over the Aegean. After participation in the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922) a long period of peace followed during which the Naval Air Service was reorganized and upgraded, especially with the establishment of the State Aircraft Factory, which manufactured various types of aircraft. In 1930 the Naval Air Service was merged with the Hellenic Army Aviation and formed the third branch <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> Armed Forces, the Hellenic Air Force.|$|E
50|$|There {{were two}} chief design traditions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mediterranean, <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> and <b>the</b> Punic (Phoenician/Carthaginian) one, which was later copied by the Romans. As {{exemplified}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trireme, <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> used {{to project the}} upper level of oars through an outrigger (parexeiresia), while the later Punic tradition heightened the ship, and had all three tiers of oars projecting directly from the side hull.|$|R

5|$|The uranography of Andromeda has {{its roots}} most firmly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> tradition, though a female figure in Andromeda's {{location}} had appeared earlier in Babylonian astronomy.

5|$|The war also {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of Athens' resurgence as a power <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> world. With their walls and their fleet restored, the Athenians were in position to turn their eyes overseas.

5|$|With the {{surrender}} of the Axis forces in Tunisia in May 1943, the LRDG changed roles and moved operations to the eastern Mediterranean, carrying out missions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Greek</b> islands, Italy and the Balkans.
