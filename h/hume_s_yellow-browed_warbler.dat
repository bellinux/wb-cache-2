50|$|It was {{recently}} split from the <b>yellow-browed</b> <b>warbler</b> (Phylloscopus inornatus), based on differences in morphology, bioacoustics, and molecular characters. The Western Hume's leaf warbler's range overlaps {{with that of}} the <b>yellow-browed</b> <b>warbler</b> in the western Sayan Mountains, but the species apparently do not hybridize. The divergence between the two species has been tentatively estimated at roughly 2,5 million years ago (Ma), and that between P. h. humei and P. h. mandelli at about 1 mya.|$|R

50|$|Siberian {{species such}} as <b>yellow-browed</b> <b>warbler</b> and Pechora pipit also occur much more {{regularly}} in Britain than further east in Europe. This is because migrating birds are likely {{to rest on the}} well-watched eastern coast after crossing the North Sea.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>yellow-browed</b> <b>warbler</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by the English zoologist Edward Blyth in 1842 and given the binomial name Regulus inornatus. The current genus name Phylloscopus is from Ancient Greek phullon, [...] "leaf", and skopos, [...] "seeker" [...] (from skopeo, [...] "to watch"). The specific inornatus is Latin for [...] "plain".|$|R
50|$|Its song is buzzing {{and high}} pitched. The best {{distinction}} from the <b>yellow-browed</b> <b>warbler</b> {{is the more}} disyllabic call. While the eastern and western Hume's leaf warblers already show noticeable differences in mtDNA sequence and calls, their songs do not differ; they are reproductively isolated only by allopatry and not usually considered separate species.|$|R
50|$|The <b>yellow-browed</b> <b>warbler</b> (Phylloscopus inornatus) is a leaf warbler (family Phylloscopidae) which breeds in {{temperate}} Asia. This warbler {{is strongly}} migratory and winters mainly in tropical South Asia and South-east Asia, {{but also in}} small numbers in western Europe. Like the rest of Phylloscopidae, it was formerly included in the Old World warbler assemblage.|$|R
50|$|Adult firecrests are {{unlikely}} to be confused with any other species; Pallas's warbler has a similar head and wing pattern, but its crown stripe is pale lemon, not bright yellow or orange, and its supercilium is also pale yellow, not bright white. The juvenile common firecrest might be confused with the goldcrest, but usually shows enough face pattern to distinguish it from its relative, which has a very plain face at all ages. The firecrest can also be separated from Pallas's warbler by the warbler's pale crown stripe and yellow rump. There is more likelihood of confusing the juvenile firecrest with the <b>yellow-browed</b> <b>warbler,</b> which has a similar head pattern; the warbler (an Asiatic species) has pale fringes to the feathers of the closed wing, a whitish belly and darker brown legs. The <b>yellow-browed</b> <b>warbler</b> also lacks the pale half circle present below the young firecrest's eye.|$|R
50|$|It is a Local Nature Reserve. It is {{used for}} dog walking, fishing and birdwatching, with a bird hide having been installed. Birds which are spotted {{regularly}} include herons, egrets, kingfishers, cormorants, grebes, gulls, ducks and also {{a wide range of}} woodland birds such as nuthatch, treecreeper and woodpeckers. Rarities have included ring-necked duck, great white egret, cattle egret and <b>yellow-browed</b> <b>warbler.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{goldcrest}} {{is usually}} easily distinguished from other small birds in its range, but poor views could possibly lead to confusion {{with the common}} firecrest or <b>yellow-browed</b> <b>warbler.</b> The adult common firecrest has a distinguishing face pattern showing a bright white supercilium (eyebrow) and black eye-stripe, and the juvenile usually shows enough of this face pattern to be readily distinguished from the plain-faced goldcrest. The <b>yellow-browed</b> <b>warbler</b> has a yellowish supercilium and pale crown stripe, so also shows a different head pattern. The ruby-crowned kinglet, an American Regulus species and a potential vagrant in Europe, could {{be more difficult to}} distinguish. It has a plain face like its Old World cousin, but the male has a red crest without any yellow or a black border. Female and juvenile ruby-crowned kinglets lack the ruby-red crown patch, but compared with the similarly crestless juvenile goldcrest, the American bird is larger in size, has an obvious whitish eyering, and yellowish wing bars.|$|R

50|$|Three {{types of}} migratory birds are regular {{visitors}} to Punjab’s provincial metropolis. These are winter visitors, summer visitors and transit migrants. The winter visitors come in September and stay until May. They come from northern latitudes and higher altitudes and include <b>yellow-browed</b> <b>warbler,</b> common starling, white wagtail, yellow wagtail and white-browed wagtail {{in search of}} food. The wagtails eat small insects, spiders, mollusks and soft seeds from moist soil. They roost in tall Typha and reed growth {{on the banks of}} ponds and lakes. Summer visitors arrive from southern parts of the country; these include Asian koel, purple sunbird, golden oriole and cuckoos. They also come here in search of food and for breeding. They stay in urban Lahore from March until September.|$|R
50|$|In 1960, {{following}} Axell's move to {{a different}} post, Scott was employed as Warden for both the bird observatory and the reserve at Dungeness. He began to gain greater notability through his work in Dungeness and also through finding three more new visiting birds to Britain. In 1960 he found the dark-eyed junco, a bird normally found in North America, and in 1968 he spotted the short-toed treecreeper, normally found in continental Europe. Both these finds were at the Dungeness reserve. He also, unknowingly, spotted the first Hume's leaf warbler in 1966, at Beachy Head, Kent.

The most {{numerous}} ringed species were Blackcap Sylvia atricapilla and Barn Swallow Hirundo rustica, while among ringed nestlings Great Tits Parus major and Blue Tits Cyanistes caeruleus prevailed. The most numerous species among recoveries was the Mute Swan Cygnus olor with probably the oldest swan recorded in Slovenia so far, a 25 -year-old female.

40|$|In 2015, 170 {{bird species}} were {{recorded}} during bird ringing activities in Slovenia. We ringed 73, 371 birds belonging to 162 species, there were 132 foreign recoveries of birds ringed in Slovenia, 120 recoveries of birds ringed abroad and found in Slovenia, {{as well as}} 1964 local recoveries. The most frequently ringed species were Blackcap Sylvia atricapilla and Great Tit Parus major. In ringed nestlings, Great Tits and Tree Sparrows Passer montanus predominated. In 2015, the first preliminary ringing of Scops Owls Otus scops during migration took place, resulting in {{the highest number of}} Scops Owls ringed so far. Concerning recoveries of birds ringed in Slovenia and later recorded abroad and birds ringed abroad and later recorded in Slovenia, the commonest were Mute Swans Cygnus olor and Black-headed Gulls Chroicocephalus ridibundus.
