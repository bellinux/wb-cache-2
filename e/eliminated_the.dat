5|$|After {{defeating}} Dallas in five games, the Canucks <b>eliminated</b> <b>the</b> Toronto Maple Leafs in the Campbell Conference Finals to {{meet the}} New York Rangers in the Finals, where the Canucks lost in seven games.

40|$|An uncertainty-averse agent prefers {{betting on}} an event whose {{probability}} is known, to betting on an event whose probability is unknown.

For {{what sort of}} preferences does a randomization <b>eliminate</b> <b>the</b> effects of uncertainty? To answer this question, we investigate an agent's preferences over sets of acts.
