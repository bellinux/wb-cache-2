25|$|Cruyff is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} typical kind of ‘artist-footballer’ or ‘footballer-thinker’ who considers football, the so-called 'beautiful game', not a purely athletic/physical competition but an artistic-oriented mind-body game. Because of his distinctive footballing views, Cruyff was called ‘the Spinoza of football’ by some. He believed in a certain style of play, which {{has the power to}} put a smile on the people's faces as he described it. When Cruyff, both as a player and as a manager, spoke about football he often mentioned the entertainment value of the game, that there is more to it than winning. In a 2009 interview with Sportmails Martin Samuel, Arsène Wenger, as a devout follower of Cruyff's footballing ideology, once shared his opinion about football's artistic value, “I believe the target of anything in life should be to do it so well that it becomes an art. When you read some books they are fantastic, the writer touches something in you that you know you would not have brought out of yourself. He makes you discover something interesting in your life. If you are living like an animal, {{what is the point of}} living? What makes daily life <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we try to transform it to something that is close to art. And football is like that. When I watch Barcelona, it is art.” , the author of Cruyff's French biography, called him ‘the greatest actor in the history of football’ because Cruyff was a glorious exception (possibly the only one ever) being the man who ‘played’ outstandingly well multiple roles in the world of football: player, manager, and thinker.|$|E
500|$|The fashion was {{extremely}} {{important in this}} video because everything was so minimal ... With the choreography, we really focused on hitting all of the accents in the drum beat.

500|$|Krumwiede is {{an ardent}} {{conspiracy}} theorist who, according to Law, {{is the so-called}} index patient for [...] "what becomes a parallel epidemic of fear and panic". [...] "We definitely wanted {{him to have a}} messianic streak", said Soderbergh, whom Law talked to during the character's creating process. The two men discussed the appearances and the behaviors of a typical anti-government conspiracy theorist. Producer Gregory Jacobs commented that [...] "what's <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> you're not really sure about him. Is the government really hiding something and does the herbal remedy he's talking about really work? I think we all suspect {{at one time or another}} that we're not getting the whole truth, and in that sense Krumwiede represents the audience's point of view." ...|$|E

500|$|Camouflage {{researcher}} Roy Behrens cites {{and discusses}} Adaptive Coloration frequently in his writings. For example, in his Camoupedia blog, {{related to the}} book of the same name, he writes of Cott's drawings of the hind limbs of the Common frog: [...] "Reproduced above {{is one of my favorite}} drawings from what is one of my favorite books." [...] He continues [...] "What makes these drawings (and the book itself) even more <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Cott (1900-1987) was not just a zoologist—he was a highly skilled scientific illustrator (these are his own pen-and-ink drawings), a wildlife photographer, and a prominent British camoufleur in World War II." [...] Still in 2011, Behrens can write of Cott's way of thinking, citing his words as models of clear and accurate explanation of the mechanisms of camouflage: [...] "As he so aptly explained it, disruptive patterns work 'by the optical destruction of what is present', while continuous patterns work 'by the optical construction of what is not present.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Sarah Ellis {{writing for}} Inside Soap said [...] "I'd {{love to see}} Chris with a boyfriend – he's the nicest guy in Erinsborough!" [...] In 2011, Mason {{revealed}} {{that he has had}} a positive reaction to his character from viewers and he has been receiving mail from people who have had similar experiences, who appreciate what Neighbours is doing. He added [...] "What's <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a lot of feedback has been about the fact the character's coming out wasn't a [...] "warm and fuzzy" [...] experience, that there were rough spots. They appreciated the authenticity of the story, and I think that comes from the character and storylines being based on other people's real life experiences." [...] Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun branded Chris Erinsborough's token gay. He added [...] "Good on Neighbours for not having their gay character flouncing around in a midriff top listening to Britney Spears." [...] Inside Soap's staff said that they could not wait to see how Chris would get on with Aidan. They added that it was [...] "high time he had a boyfriend". Of the Chris and Scotty storyline, Melinda Houston from The Sun-Herald wrote [...] "Good on Neighbours for not just having an ongoing gay character but using him to explore some interesting issues.|$|E
500|$|The Persona {{series has}} been {{referred}} to as the most popular spin-off from the Megami Tensei franchise, gaining notoriety and success in its own right. Io9's James Whitbrook commented that while [...] "here in the west, we've got plenty of awesome urban fantasy, especially from a YA perspective. But what makes Persona <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it's the familiar concept of Urban fantasy, the balance of the mundane [...] "normal" [...] life of the protagonists and the problems they have there with the fantastical nature of the supernatural world that lies beneath all that, from a Japanese perspective. Over here, that's much less common, and the way the series portrays urban fantasy through that lens is what makes it so different, especially from what you would normally expect from Japanese RPGs.". Nintendo Power, in an article concerning the Megami Tensei series, cited the Persona series' [...] "modern-day horror stories" [...] and [...] "teams of Japanese high-school kids" [...] as the perfect example of the franchise. Persona was mentioned in 1999 by GameSpot's Andrew Vestal as a game that deserved attention despite not aging well, saying [...] "Examining Persona reveals three of the traits that make the series so popular - and unique - amongst RPG fans: demonology, negotiation, and psychology". The game has been named as a cult classic. Persona 3 was named by RPGamer as the greatest RPG of the past decade in 2009, and RPGFan listed Persona 3 and 4 in second and fourth place respectively in their similar 2011 list. Persona 3 was listed by Gamasutra as one of the 20 essential RPGs for players of the genre. Persona 4 was also listed by Famitsu {{as one of the greatest}} games of all time in a 2010 list.|$|E

500|$|Shakira and Amanda Ghost, the {{executive}} {{producers of the}} album, enlisted {{a diverse group of}} producers to collaborate on the tracks, such as Pharrell Williams, one half of the record production duo The Neptunes, who co-wrote four of the tracks on the album with Shakira. Other collaborators included John Hill, Sam Endicott, and Timbaland. Shakira later said that her collaboration with Williams helped her learn a lot, noting [...] "When collaborating you always try and capture something from the other person and I learnt a lot from his method". The singer revealed that the two readied four tracks in five days, and commented that [...] "What was <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he's very fast and immediate in the studio and I'm a little slower". Endicott, musician and lead singer of American post-punk band The Bravery, was personally called by Shakira to co-compose the title track of the album along with Hill. He explained how they both began working with the single, saying she [...] "contacted him , asking if he had any stuff. We never had her in mind. We just made the thing independently of her, and then she liked it a lot, and she sang over it. She used some of the melodies we put in there and then wrote these crazy lyrics about being a werewolf. And that's how it happened". Haitian-American rapper Wyclef Jean, who previously appeared as a featured artist on [...] "Hips Don't Lie" [...] with Shakira, talked about his chemistry with her, saying [...] "I have a natural chemistry with Shakira. I love the Latin vibe. The Lebanese vibe. I love the multicultural aspect of the CD. These days it's hard for you to pick up a CD and love it from beginning to end. Shakira represents that 360 degrees of: You put it in, and the whole CD rocks". In She Wolf, Jean appears as a featured artist on the track [...] "Spy".|$|E
2500|$|One {{thing that}} makes Petri nets <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they provide a balance between {{modeling}} power and analyzability: many things one {{would like to know}} about concurrent systems can be automatically determined for Petri nets, although some of those things are very expensive to determine in the general case. [...] Several subclasses of Petri nets have been studied that can still model interesting classes of concurrent systems, while these problems become easier.|$|E
2500|$|This volatility/credit {{dichotomy}} is {{the standard}} practice for valuing convertibles. [...] What makes convertibles so <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> except {{in the case of}} exchangeables (see above), one cannot entirely separate the volatility from the credit. [...] Higher volatility (a good thing) tends to accompany weaker credit (bad). In the case of exchangeables, the credit quality of the issuer may be decoupled from the volatility of the underlying shares. [...] The true artists of convertibles and exchangeables are the people who know how to play this balancing act.|$|E
50|$|Another <b>interesting</b> aside <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Vikings {{had three}} {{brothers}} on their Championship Team, John, David and Marty Berthelot.|$|R

2500|$|Lead singer Bono {{explained}} {{that he had to}} ask himself a few hard questions before carrying on recording: [...] "I wanted to check where I was to where I am. So I went back and listened to all the music that made me {{want to be in a}} band, right from the Buzzcocks, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Echo & The Bunnymen, all that stuff. And what was <b>interesting</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> was what a lot of people in bands now are listening to anyway. So in a funny way, it made us completely contemporary." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mark Caleb Smith, {{director}} of the Center for Political Studies at Cedarville University, said, [...] "Many of the people you'd say {{are members of the}} Christian right would consider Mormonism to be cultish, and so what's <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Beck [...] is seemingly building bridges to that community from a very different theological perspective." [...] However, several theologically conservative evangelicals, many of them Beck fans politically, criticized evangelicals' [...] "standing together in the faith" [...] with Beck at the religion-centered rally, because Beck is Mormon and thus in their view not [...] "a fellow Christian." ...|$|E
2500|$|Professor Emeritus of the Alfvén Laboratory in Sweden, Carl-Gunne Fälthammar wrote: [...] "A {{reason why}} Birkeland {{currents}} are particularly <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> in the plasma forced to carry them, they cause {{a number of}} plasma physical processes to occur (waves, instabilities, fine structure formation). These in turn lead to consequences such as acceleration of charged particles, both positive and negative, and element separation (such as preferential ejection of oxygen ions). Both of these classes of phenomena should have a general astrophysical interest far beyond that of understanding the space environment of our own Earth." ...|$|E

50|$|This is a ground-floor {{building}} with a higher {{central part of the}} house. It is preceded by a four column Tuscan portico crowned with a triangular pediment. <b>Interesting</b> fact <b>is</b> <b>that</b> portico. <b>Interesting</b> fact <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the portico <b>was</b> placed in the garden elevation rather than the front elevation. This change of the front elevation and opening the living room for the view of the park is an expression of a new era of the Enlightenment.|$|R

2500|$|There {{have been}} various finds {{of silver and}} gold coins in the Selsey area. Gold coins from the Atrebates rulers named Commius, Tincommius, Verica, Eppillus, and Cunobelin [...] {{were found on the}} beach in 1877, it is thought that these coins would have been minted locally. The ancient British coins would have been {{superseded}} by Roman coins and there have been finds of them too. In addition, some Anglo-Saxon gold fragments were found on the beach between Selsey and Bognor, these were dated as late [...] 6th/ 8th century and what made them particularly <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they had a runic inscription on them, the fragments were handed over to the British Museum.|$|E
2500|$|American Motors Corporation was {{a common}} client of Jo-Han, {{producing}} mainly 1/25 scale promo models. 1959 and 1960 Rambler station wagons were produced by Jo-Han. These were not offered in kit form - but the demand was not as great for station wagon kits. These were later re-issued by X-El Products and Okey Spaulding in the 1990s and early 2000s. Though perhaps not as collectible, the later issues were made in non-warping styrene plastic. The company also made Rambler Classic sedans and American convertibles for 1963-1965, however, the 1963 and 1964 versions were of a slightly larger 1:24 scale, apparently AMC wanted them that way. [...] Also <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> both the dealer promo and the dimestore versions of these Classics came with friction motors - as usually the promo versions did not.|$|E
2500|$|Formally, the satire in the Tale is {{historically}} novel for several reasons. First, Swift {{more or less}} invented prose parody. In the [...] "Apology for the [...] " [...] (added in 1710), Swift explains that his work is, in several places, a [...] "parody," [...] which is where he imitates the style of persons he wishes to expose. What is <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the word [...] "parody" [...] had not been used for prose before, and the definition he offers is arguably a parody of John Dryden defining [...] "parody" [...] in the Discourse of Satire (the Preface to Dryden's translations of Juvenal's and Persius' satires). Prior to Swift, parodies were imitations designed to bring mirth, but not primarily {{in the form of}} mockery. Dryden imitated the Aeneid in [...] "MacFlecknoe" [...] to describe the apotheosis of a dull poet, but the imitation made fun of the poet, not Virgil.|$|E
50|$|One <b>interesting</b> note <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{unlike in}} the American {{schooling}} system Ivorians never learn how to print their letters. Cursive <b>is</b> all <b>that</b> <b>is</b> used.|$|R
60|$|The fellow had {{actually}} managed {{to steal a}} lighter with silver, and this, it seems only because he was implicitly trusted by his employers, who must have been singularly poor judges of character. In the sailor's story he is represented as an unmitigated rascal, a small cheat, stupidly ferocious, morose, of mean appearance, and altogether unworthy of the greatness this opportunity had thrust upon him. What <b>was</b> <b>interesting</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he would boast of it openly.|$|R
50|$|<b>Interesting</b> here <b>is</b> <b>that</b> German heraldic {{terminology}} {{calls the}} field pattern neunfach … geteilt (“ninefold divided”) and English heraldic terminology calls it “barry of ten”.|$|R
2500|$|The Union of Utrecht had {{guaranteed}} {{freedom of}} conscience, {{but this did}} not imply freedom of worship. Except for the Dutch Reformed Church, public worship by other denominations was usually restricted with more or less severity, and membership of the privileged church {{was supposed to be}} a prerequisite for holding public office (though this rule was often honored in the breach, even as far as Catholic office holders in the Generality Lands were concerned). This policy of supremacy of the Public Church was, however, never enforced consistently, either in the different parts of the country, or over time. In general, a policy of de facto toleration predominated, even when legal prohibitions were in force. This went against the grain of the Calvinist diehards, who constantly insisted on official suppression of competing faiths, going back to the Contra-Remonstrant controversy of 1618. Their Remonstrant opponents had come to defend religious toleration after their own suppression, and though Remonstrant regents had been ousted at the time, this political point of view remained in favor with the Holland regents, unlike their colleagues in most other provinces. The debate continued to flare up from time to time. The flap over the Holland public prayers was just one of many instances. What makes it <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> such debates were usually not over doctrinal matters, but in a sense about [...] "public order." [...] Also, they tended quickly to widen to debates over unsettled constitutional matters, like the provincial-supremacy claim of the Holland regents.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2008, Hardwicke, in a turnabout {{from her}} initial underwhelmed {{reaction}} upon first seeing {{a photograph of}} Pattinson, enthused; [...] "The thing that’s great about him is he really does [...] feel like he’s otherworldly. I mean, he doesn’t look like a normal guy. And {{when you read the}} book, you think, ‘Who on the planet can live up to this description?’ But I think he does. He’s just got that chiseled face that photographs exactly like it’s described in the book. When you read about the sculptured cheeks and chiseled jawbone and everything, it’s like, ‘Wow. Did she write this for Rob?" [...] Pattinson, in a detailed interview on how he perceives the character, admitted to having incorporated aspects of Rebel Without a Cause into his portrayal of Edward, assessing; [...] "I guess kind of the thing which I found <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he is essentially the hero of this story but violently denies that he is the hero. Like at every point even when he does heroic things he still thinks that he’s [...] the most ridiculously selfish evil creature around. [...] He refuses to accept Bella’s love for him {{but at the same time}} can’t help but just kind of needs it, which is kind of what the essential storyline is." [...] Appearing at ComicCon in July 2008 while the film was in post-production, Pattinson surmised the Twilight experience as: [...] "bizarre. You kind of know that it is essentially the book. The book has so many obsessive, obsessively loyal fans. It's strange because people just immediately relate you to the character right away rather than you as an actor." [...] Pattinson reprised his role as Edward in all of the Twilight sequels.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1980s {{a fierce}} {{interchange}} {{took place between}} Gardner and Colin Wilson. [...] In The Quest for Wilhelm Reich Wilson wrote of this book(Gardner) writes about various kinds of cranks with the conscious superiority of the scientist, {{and in most cases}} one can share his sense of the victory of reason. But after half a dozen chapters this non-stop superiority begins to irritate; you begin to wonder about the standards that make him so certain he is always right. He asserts that the scientist, unlike the crank, does his best to remain open-minded. So how can he be so sure that no sane person has ever seen a flying saucer, or used a dowsing rod to locate water? And that all the people he disagrees with are unbalanced fanatics? A colleague of the positivist philosopher A. J. Ayer once remarked wryly [...] "I wish I was as certain of anything as he seems to be about everything". Martin Gardner produces the same feeling. By Wilson's own account, up to that time he and Gardner had been friends, but Gardner took offence. In February 1989 Gardner wrote a letter published in The New York Review of Books describing Wilson as [...] "England’s leading journalist of the occult, and a firm believer in ghosts, poltergeists, levitations, dowsing, PK (psychokinesis), ESP, and every other aspect of the psychic scene". Shortly afterwards, Wilson replied, defending himself and adding [...] "What strikes me as so <b>interesting</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> when Mr. Gardner—and his colleagues of CSICOP—begin to denounce the 'Yahoos of the paranormal,' they manage to generate an atmosphere of such intense hysteria ...". Gardner in turn replied quoting his own earlier description of Wilson: [...] "The former boy wonder, tall and handsome in his turtleneck sweater, has now decayed into one of those amiable eccentrics for which the land of Conan Doyle is noted. They prowl comically about the lunatic fringes of science ..." ...|$|E
