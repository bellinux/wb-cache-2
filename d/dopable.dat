Scintillating crystals are selected for high structural perfection, high density and high effective atomic number. LuAG is particularly favored over other crystals for its high density and thermal conductivity. LuAG has {{a relatively small}} lattice constant {{in comparison to the}} other rare earth garnets, which results in a higher density producing a crystal field with narrower linewidths and greater energy level splitting in absorption and emission. These properties make it an excellent host for active ions such as Yb, Tm, Er, and Ho employed in diode pumped Solid-state lasers.The density of the Lutetium crystal is greater than that of other metals, such as Yttrium, meaning that the crystal properties do not change with the addition of dopant ions. It can be especially useful for high energy particle detection and quatification on account of its density and thermal stability. This high melting temperature, in addition to the lack of availability of Lutetium has made this crystal less commonly used than its fellow garnets, despite its favorable physical properties.|$|E

The conductivity of such a system can be considered to result from rapid self-exchange between discrete units.

With the use of unconventional first-principles calculations suited to the study of strongly correlated materials, we describe the change in the electronic and magnetic properties through the whole doping range (up to one hole per CuO(2) unit). Singlet polarons, whose space and energy distributions are described in detail, are found by our calculations to be stable above a concentration of similar to 0. 3 holes per Cu. We give a sound interpretation of the observed insulating behavior and loss of antiferromagnetic ordering at low doping and predict unusual properties in the doping region, where experimental data are not yet available. The system is antiferromagnetic and hopping conducting for x/n up to about 0. 25, gapped around 0. 3 - 0. 4, metallic from 0. 4 to 1, and gapped and ZRS-saturated at x/n= 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a new method {{to reverse the}} polarity and charge transport behavior of naphthalenediimide (NDI) -based copolymers by inserting a vinylene linker between the donor and acceptor units. The vinylene linkers minimize the intrinsic steric congestion between the NDI and thiophene moieties to prompt backbone planarity. The polymers with vinylene linkers exhibit electron n-channel transport characteristics under vacuum, similar to the benchmark polymer, P(NDI 2 OD-T 2). To our surprise, when the polymers are measured in air, the dominant carrier type switches from n- to p-type and yield hole mobilities up to 0. 45 cm(2) s(- 1) with hole to electron mobility ratio of three (mu(h) /mu(e), similar to 3), which indicates that the hole density in the active layer can be significantly increased by exposure to air. This increase {{is consistent with the}} intrinsic more delocalized nature of the highest occupied molecular orbital of the charged vinylene polymer, as estimated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which facilitates hole transport within the polymer chains. This is the first demonstration of an efficient NDI-based hole semiconducting polymer, which will enable new developments in all-polymer solar cells, complementary circuits, and <b>dopable</b> polymers for use in thermoelectrics...|$|E

The intriguing interplay between lattice, charge, spin and orbital {{degrees of freedom}} leads to a complex phase diagram bounded by a nominal Mott (x= 0) regime and a band-insulating (x= 1) phase. By means of the charge self-consistent density functional theory (DFT) plus dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) scheme, built on a pseudopotential framework combined with a continuous-time quantum Monte-Carlo solver, we here study the one-particle spectral function A(k,ω) {{as well as the}} thermopower S(T). The computations may account for the suppression of the e_g' pockets in A(k,ω) at lower doping in line with photoemission experiments. Enhancement of the thermopower is verified within the present elaborate multi-orbital method to treat correlated materials. In addition, the two-particle dynamic spin susceptibility χ_s(ω,q) is investigated based on a simplified tight-binding approach, yet by including vertex contributions in the DMFT linear response. Besides the identification of paramagnon branches at higher doping, a prominent high-energy antiferromagnetic mode close to x= 0. 67 is therewith identified in χ_s(ω,q), which can be linked to extended hopping terms on the CoO_ 2 sublattice...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{systematic}} analysis of the underlying mechanism of transition-metal doping in ZnSe nanocrystals, using first-principles density functional theory calculations. Our analysis focuses on the adsorption and surface segregation of Mn dopants on ZnSe nanocrystal surface facets. We find that the chemical potentials of the growth precursor species determine the surface structure and morphology of the nanocrystals. We report binding energies for Mn adsorption onto ZnSe surfaces and find that all the anion-rich surfaces contribute toward dopant adsorption onto ZnSe nanocrystal surface facets. Beyond a critical value of dopant surface coverage, these adsorbed dopants may induce structural transitions in low-Miller-index surface facets, resulting in morphological transitions of the ZnSe nanocrystals. In addition, the dopant binding-energy dependence on the dopant surface concentration explains the doping difficulties during nanocrystal growth. Finally, we report surface segregation energy profiles for Mn dopant segregation on low-Miller-index ZnSe nanocrystal surface facets. We find that, under conditions that render ZnSe(001) -(2 x 1) as the dominant <b>dopable</b> surface of ZnSe nanocrystals, Mn dopants {{do not have a}} tendency to segregate on this surface; this guarantees that the dopants remain incorporated into the core regions of the nanocrystal instead of escaping to the surface.

40|$|Monolithic {{integration}} of III-V optoelectronic devices with materials for various functionalities inexpensively is always desirable. Polysilicon (poly-Si) {{is an ideal}} platform because it is <b>dopable</b> and semi-conducting and can be deposited and patterned easily {{on a wide range}} of low cost substrates. However, the lack of crystalline coherency in poly-Si poses an immense challenge for high-quality epitaxial growth. In this work, we demonstrate, for the first time, direct growth of micron-sized InGaAs/GaAs nanopillars on polysilicon. Transmission electron microscopy shows that the micron-sized pillars are single-crystalline and single Wurzite-phase, far exceeding the substrate crystal grain size ~ 100 nm. The high quality growth is enabled by the unique tapering geometry at the base of the nanostructure, which reduces the effective InGaAs/Si contact area to < 40 nm in diameter. The small footprint not only reduces stress due to lattice mismatch but also prevents the nanopillar from nucleating on multiple Si crystal grains. This relaxes the grain size requirement for poly-Si, potentially reducing the cost for poly-Si deposition. Lasing is achieved in the as-grown pillars under optical pumping, attesting their excellent crystalline and optical quality. These promising results open up a pathway for low-cost synergy of optoelectronics with other technologies such as CMOS integrated circuits, sensing, nanofluidics, thin film transistor display, photovoltaics, etc...|$|E

Two new donor–acceptor (D–A) {{conjugated}} polymers P 1 and P 2 containing 3, 4 -didodecyloxythiophene and 1, 3, 4 -oxadiazole {{units are}} synthesized via Wittig reaction methodology. Cyclic voltammetry studies {{reveal that the}} polymers are both p and n <b>dopable,</b> and possess low-lying LUMO energy levels (− 3. 34 eV for P 1 and − 3. 46 eV for P 2) and high-lying HOMO energy levels (− 5. 34 eV for P 1 and − 5. 27 eV for P 2). The optical band gap of the polymers is {{in the range of}} 2. 25 – 2. 29 eV, calculated from the onset absorption edge. The polymers emit orange to yellow light in the film state when irradiated with a UV light. The synthesized polymers are used to prepare polymer nanocomposites with different wt% of silver nanoparticles. The polymer nanocomposites are characterized by UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. Both polymers and polymer/Ag nanocomposites show good thermal stability with onset decomposition temperature around 300 °C under nitrogen atmosphere. The nonlinear optical properties of polymers and polymer/Ag nanocomposites are measured by Z-scan technique. Both polymers and polymer nanocomposites show a good optical limiting behavior. Nearly five times enhancement in the nonlinear optical properties is observed for polymer/Ag nanocomposites. The value of effective two-photon absorption coefficient (β) is in the order of 10 − 10 – 10 − 11 m/W.

40|$|Herein, we dope a {{low-dimensional}} ZnO {{system with}} a wide range of rare earth (RE) ions. Through systematic calculations, the <b>dopable</b> range of all ZnO systems was found to be asymmetrical, which accounts for the difficulty in achieving p-type doping. Low-dimensional ZnO systems, similar to 2 D graphene-like nanosheets, have a wider doping limit. Thus, 2 D ZnO is a promising candidate to achieve a wider doping range in ZnO. To further examine energy transfer in upconversion luminescence, the excited states of all lanthanide (Ln) elements in both the Ln(2 +) and Ln(3 +) ionic state in the bulk ZnO lattice were extensively studied. The probability of mixed valences of the Ln dopant ions occurring in ZnO was discussed, along with the analysis of the relative oscillator strengths. At the Ln(2 +) states, the heavy lanthanide elements usually dominated the energy transmission channel at high energy, the medium lanthanide elements mostly occupied the middle range of the optical fundamental gap, and the light lanthanide elements were widely spread over the optical band gap as well as the conduction band range. However, Ln(3 +) ions, as the sensitizing dopant, have reduced energy barriers for excited state absorption, showing wider energy transfer channels that are evenly distributed within 3. 0 eV, which is lower than the conduction band edge absorption in Ln(2 +). Meanwhile, each energy level has an obviously stronger oscillator strength, indicating a larger probability for excitation and energy transport between the inter-levels. Thus, in physicochemical and biological terms, trivalent Ln doping follows the removal of apical dominance concept, contributing more flexible energy transfer within the biological window for in vivo imaging or other related optoelectronic devices.

40|$|We studied native point {{defects in}} CaS by DFT+ Hubbard U method. The {{effect of the}} {{localization}} of the d orbitals of Ca pseudopotential has been included. The Hubbard U corrected d-orbital for Ca sites are playing a role assisting the charge transfer from p orbitals of S site to the Ca site, giving both localized electron and hole states within the band gap, with an energy interval of 1. 2 ~ 1. 4 eV. This corresponds to the localized excitonic levels below the conduction band edge for the optical absorption. The electronic properties and formation energies of native point defects have been discussed. We found the neutral S vacancy has the lowest energy of 0. 62 eV under Ca-rich limit. The Schottky defect pair defect is another dominant defect with cost of 1. 51 eV per defect site from S-rich to Ca-rich chemical potential limits. The defect formation energy further summarized that the doubly positive S vacancy and doubly negative Ca vacancy are both the most stable donor-type and acceptor-type defects respectively coexisting in CaS. We also summarized a narrow doping limit energy which has been determined as 1. 33 eV constantly in CaS independent to different chemical potential limits. But such doping allowed range entirely shifts from valence band vicinity toward the conduction band edge from S-rich to Ca-rich limits. Under S-rich limit, the <b>dopable</b> range for EF shifting corresponds to Eu 2 + doping experiments, the luminescence wavelength limit is predicted to be 659 nm (1. 88 eV) remarkably close to the reported results 650 nm. This gives a solid theoretical reference for the lanthanide ions doping experiments in CaS. We conclude that the defect levels combined with formation energy is an accessible way to suggest the doping energy range and an assistant to explain the activation stage of photostimulated luminescence (PSL) mechanism in lanthanide ions doped crystal materials.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{characterization}} and implementation of transparent electron transport materials (ETM) in vacuum deposited p-i-n type organic solar cells (OSC) for substituting the parasitically absorbing standard ETM composed of n-doped C 60. In addition to transparency in the visible range of the sun spectrum, the desired material properties include high electron mobility and conductivity, thermal and morphological stability, as well as good energy level alignment relative to the adjacent acceptor layer which is commonly composed of intrinsic C 60. In this work, representatives of three different material classes are evaluated {{with regard to the}} above mentioned criteria. HATCN (hexaazatriphenylene hexacarbonitrile) is a small discoid molecule with six electron withdrawing nitrile groups at its periphery. It forms smooth thin films with an optical energy gap of 3. 3 eV, thus being transparent in the visible range of the sun spectrum. Doping with either 5 wt% of the cationic n-dopant AOB or 7 wt% of the proprietary material NDN 1 effectively increases the conductivity to 7. 6 * 10 ^- 6 S/cm or 2. 2 * 10 ^- 4 S/cm, respectively. However, the fabrication of efficient OSC is impeded by the exceptionally high electron affinity (EA) of approximately 4. 8 eV that causes the formation of an electron injection barrier between n-HATCN and intrinsic C 60 (EA= 4. 0 eV). This work presents a strategy to remove the barrier by introducing doped and undoped C 60 intermediate layers, thus demonstrating the importance of energy level matching in a multi-layer structure and the advantages of Fermi level control by doping. Next, a series of six Bis-Fl-NTCDI (N,N-bis(fluorene- 2 -yl) -naphthalenetetracarboxylic diimide) compounds, which only differ by the length of the alkyl chains attached to the C 9 positions of the fluorene side groups, is examined. When increasing the chain length from 0 to 6 carbon atoms, the energy levels remain nearly unchanged: We find EA= 3. 5 eV as estimated from cyclic voltammetry, an ionization potential (IP) in the range between 6. 45 eV and 6. 63 eV, and Eg,opt= 3. 1 eV which means that all compounds form transparent thin films. Concerning thin film morphology, the addition of side chains results in the formation of amorphous layers with a surface roughness < 1 nm on room temperature glass substrates, and (1. 5 +/- 0. 5) nm for deposition onto glass substrates heated to 100 °C. In contrast, films composed of the side chain free compound Bis-HFl-NTCDI exhibit a larger surface roughness of (2. 5 +/- 0. 5) nm and 9 nm, respectively, and are nanocrystalline already at room temperature. Moreover, the conductivity achievable by n-doping is very sensitive to the side chain length: Whereas doping of Bis-HFl-NTCDI with 7 wt% NDN 1 results in a conductivity in the range of 10 ^- 4 S/cm, the attachment of alkyl chains causes a conductivity which is more than three orders of magnitude smaller despite equal or slightly higher doping concentrations. The insufficient transport properties of the alkylated derivatives lead to the formation of pronounced s-kinks in the jV -characteristics of p-i-n type OSC while the use of n-Bis-HFl-NTCDI results in well performing devices. The last material, HATNA-Cl 6 (2, 3, 8, 9, 14, 15 - hexachloro- 5, 6, 11, 12, 17, 18 -hexaazatrinaphthylene), exhibits Eg,opt= 2. 7 eV and is therefore not completely transparent in the visible range of the sun spectrum. However, its energy level positions of EA= 4. 1 eV and IP= 7. 3 eV are well suited for the application as ETM in combination with i-C 60 as acceptor. The compound is <b>dopable</b> with all available n-dopants, resulting in maximum conductivities of sigma= 1. 6 * 10 ^- 6, 3. 5 * 10 ^- 3, and 7. 5 * 10 ^- 3 S/cm at 7. 5 wt% AOB, Cr 2 (hpp) 4, and NDN 1, respectively. Applying n-HATNA-Cl 6 instead of the reference ETM n-C 60 results in a comparable or improved photocurrent density at an ETM thickness d(ETM) = 40 nm or 120 nm, respectively. At d(ETM) = 120 nm, the efficiency eta is more than doubled as it increases from eta(n-C 60) = 0. 4 % to eta(n-HATNA-Cl 6) = 0. 9 %. Optical simulations show that the replacement of n-C 60 by n-Bis-HFl-NTCDI, n-HATNA-Cl 6, or the previously studied n-NTCDA (naphthalenetretracarboxylic dianhydride) in p-i-n or n-i-p type device architectures is expected to result in an increased photocurrent due to reduced parasitic absorption. For quantifying the gain, the performance of p-i-n type OSC with varying ETM type and thickness is evaluated. Special care has to be taken when analyzing devices comprising the reference ETM n-C 60 as its conductivity is sufficiently large to extend the area of the aluminum cathode and thus the effective device area which may lead to distorted results. Overall, the experiment is able to confirm the trends predicted by the optical simulation. At large ETM thickness in the range between 60 and 120 nm, the window layer effect of the ETM is most pronounced. For instance, at d(ETM) = 120 nm, eta(C 60) is more than doubled using n-HATNA-Cl 6 and even more than tripled using n-Bis-HFl-NTCDI or n-NTCDA. At optimized device geometry the photocurrent gain is slightly less than expected but nonetheless, the efficiency is improved from eta(max) = 2. 1 % for n-C 60 and n-HATNA-Cl 6 solar cells to eta(max) = 2. 3, and 2. 4 % for n-Bis-HFl-NTCDI and n-NTCDA devices, respectively. This development is supported by generally higher Voc and FF in solar cells with transparent ETM. Finally, p-i-n type solar cells with varying ETM are aged at a temperature of 50 °C and an illumination intensity of approximately 2 suns. Having extrapolated lifetimes t(80) of 36, 500, and 14000 h and nearly unchanged jV-characteristics after 2000 h, n-C 60 and n-Bis-HFl-NTCDI devices exhibit the best stability. In contrast, n-NTCDA devices suffer from a constant decrease in Isc while n-HATNA-Cl 6 solar cells show a rapid dscegradation of both Isc and FF associated with a decomposition of the material or a complete de-doping of the ETM. Here, lifetimes of only 4500 h and 445 hare achieved...|$|E
40|$|Amorphous carbon {{film with}} Diamond like {{properties}} {{is the subject}} of intense interest in the past one and half decade. The unusual properties of these diamond like carbon films arise from the preponderance of SP 3 tetrahedral bonding of carbon in the film. Depending on the processing technique and the processing conditions used, the structure of the films can range from amorphous carbon to large grain polycrystalline diamond. These deposited amorphous carbon films, which are smooth, may find their use in optoelectronics, in dielectric films and in microelectronics. These films are found to be chemically inhomogeneous(containing SP 3 hybridized carbon in a matrix of SP 2 hybridized non-graphitic carbon). There is a possibility of using these films as substrates in microelectronics, provided the deposited films are structurally smooth, are chemically homogeneous and are <b>dopable</b> with both types of impurities. A host of other advantages of using diamond like carbon as a substrate material in microelectronics made it a topic of interest to many investigators. This prompted the author to take up investigations on diamond like carbon films from the point of examining the electrical properties of these films and on the possibility of conceiving devices based on these films. This investigation dealt with, sputter deposition of diamond like carbon films and their electrical characteristics in MCS device structures. In this, emphasis is given to the importance of processing parameters involved and the effect of each parameter on the electrical and structural properties of the film. Various substrate treatments were done prior to sputtering and found that the DLC nature of the film exists in all the films but differ from one another in electrical resistivity, in nucleation density and in their adherence to the substrate. Films deposited on substrates treated with low vapour pressure oil resulted in compressive strain in the film and lead to very poor adhesion. The nucleation density increased when the substrates are pretreated with ultrasonic agitation in hard SiC grit. The substrate temperature had a direct impact on the resistivity of the film: resistivity decreases with increase in substrate temperature. The constituents of the plasma modified the structural properties of the film, e. g. the Hydrogen content in the plasma has resulted in increasing the SP 3 hybridization content of the film, by acting as SP 2 - SP 2 network terminator. Ultra violet light focused onto the substrate, in general, enhanced the deposition rate. Inclusion of Nitrogen in the plasma substantially increased the conductivity of the material and this is used in doping of the DLC film. The carbon films deposited on silicon are used for electrical characterisation. Deposition of metal electrode on the carbon film lead to the basic (MCS) device structure. The I vs. V characteristics of the MCS structure resemble those of junction diodes. From the I vs. V characteristics at different temperatures, it has been found that the reverse current goes through a maximum, drops back to certain level and once again increases with gradual increase in temperature. This behaviour of the structure with A 1 as well as Ag as top electrode materials is explained by the heterojunction formed at the C-pSi interface. The initial increase in the reverse current is dominated by the drift of minority carriers across the depletion width at the reverse biased junction. With increase in temperature, the depletion width reduces to a minimum above a certain temperature, where the diffusion of carriers controls the current across the device. From the constructed energy-band diagram of heterojunction, it is shown that the change in the transport phenomena from drift of minority carriers to diffusion of majority carriers at the junction, introduces a barrier at the critical temperature; This is responsible for the drop in current at the critical temperature. This explains the anomaly of drop in reverse current with increase in temperature. The C vs. v characteristics showed a bell shaped behaviour indicating the presence of two junctions connected back to back. This confirms the type of contact formed at the metal-carbon interface and the type of conductivity of the film, concluding that A 1 makes a Schottky contact where as Ag makes an ohmic contact and the deposited film behaves like n-type material. The C vs. V behaviour with temperature is explained by the two types of contacts in the case of Al-GpSi, i. e. Schottky contact at Al-C; and heterojunction at C-pSi interface. These C vs. V and I vs. V changes with temperature are in tune with each other and the model proposed takes care of all the characteristics observed. In case of Ag-GpSi, C vs. V with temperature shows junction like behaviour at elevated temperatures and are explained by the presence of the interface at C-pSi. It has been observed that in some of the carbon films, when an electric field of the order of l 06 V/cm is applied, the reflectance of the Aluminium metal dot is increased by 5 times, coupled with a 50 to 100 times increase in the associated capacitance of the MCS structure. The increase in reflectance is explained by considering the film to be inhomogeneous with a matrix of varying dielectric constants (SP 3 hybridized carbon in a medium of SP 2 bonded carbon). The transformed film, is homogeneous and enhances the reflectance of the Aluminium dot. This is termed as "homogeneity induced smoothness. " The transformation of inhomogeneous material to homogeneous material is further confirmed by the Raman spectroscopy, in which the broad peak is converted to a sharp peak changing the FWHM from 93 cm- 1 to 4 cm- 1; denoting the structural order in the film. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation reporting the crystalline nature of the DLC, with structural order and the corresponding FWHM of the Raman peak as low as 4 cm- 1. The preparational conditions of the film to get this transformation and the influence of various process parameters are examined. Devices based on Metal-Carbon-Oxide- Silicon (MCOS) structure are realized by thermally grown oxide/sputter deposited oxide on silicon, prior to carbon deposition. These structures showed voltage controlled negative resistance(VCNR) characteristics. The applied voltage and its distribution across the reverse biased junction and across the oxide gives rise to a negative resistance region. With the number of V vs. I characteristics measured, it is observed that the negative resistance region also shifts. This is attributed to the trapped charges in the carbon changing the distribution of applied voltage. This is explained by modifying the energy-band diagram. A concept of the accumalated charges at the oxide barrier filling up the higher energy states in the carbon and silicon, to become hot carriers is used. As long a. more voltage is dropped across the oxide, these hot carriers can surmount the barrier at the reverse biased junction. The flow of these carriers is cut off when the additional voltage is dropped across the reverse biased junction leading to a drop in the current. A further increase in the applied voltage nominally increases the current due to increase in the leakage current. A new hybrid (electrical/optical) read only memory (ROM) element is conceived {{and the way in which}} the information can be written and read is discussed. A two terminal negative resistance device using MCOS structure is fabricated and tested for its VCNR property. An analog memory device is proposed using the MCOS structure as gate in an FET. The work reported in this thesis has been divided into nine chapters. The introductory remarks on the importance of the area of research and about the work reported in this thesis are given in chapter one. Chapter two deals with some of the basic concepts related to understand the reported work. In chapter three the research work done by other investigators covering different aspects of this work is reported and some of their investigations are reviewed. Chapter four dealt with the various preparative techniques to deposit films, their structural characterisation, and the experimental work carried out to electrically characterize these films. Chapter five presents the I vs. V & C vs. V analysis and a model to qualitatively explain them. In chapter six field induced transformation phenomena of some of these films and its impact on the reflectance of the metal dot is dealt. Chapter seven consists of the MCOS device structure, its I vs. V characteristics and a model to explain the behaviour. Chapter eight presents the application part of same of the phenomena observed in conceiving a new hybrid ROM element and a two terminal negative resistance device. The concluding ninth chapter itemizes the important results of the work and suggestions to carry forward this work which can open up new vistas in the diamond like carbon film based technology and its applications in microelectronics...|$|E
