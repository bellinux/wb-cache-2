Gray, 1839, an earlier name for the Noronha skink. (The former was assigned to Lygosoma punctatum, a member of another skink genus, by Bauer in 2003.) Miralles and coworkers proposed a new name, Trachylepis tschudii, to replace Tschudi's name punctata; the new name honors Tschudi, who first described the animal. They assigned it to the genus Trachylepis, rather than Mabuya, {{on the basis of}} several characters of the external anatomy which it shares with the former, but were unable to resolve its placement within Trachylepis. It is distinct from T.maculata, a species recorded from Guyana that represents another doubtful mainland South American record of Trachylepis. They considered three hypotheses: (1) T.tschudii is a real, but very rare species from Amazonia; (2) T.tschudii is actually <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Old World, but its origin was wrongly recorded; and (3) T.tschudii represents the same species as the Noronha skink, and it either represents an otherwise unknown Amazonian population of that species or actually comes from Fernando de Noronha and was mislabeled.

40|$|We review our high-time-resolution radio {{observations}} of the Crab pulsar and compare our data {{to a variety of}} models for the emission physics. The Main Pulse and the Low-Frequency Interpulse come <b>from</b> regions <b>somewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high-altitude emission zones (caustics) that also produce pulsed X-ray and gamma-ray emission. Although no emission model can fully explain these two components, the most likely models suggest they arise from a combination of beam-driven instabilities, coherent charge bunching and strong electromagnetic turbulence. Because the radio power fluctuates {{on a wide range of}} timescales, we know the emission zones are patchy and dynamic. It is tempting to invoke unsteady pair creation in high-altitude gaps as source of the variability, but current pair cascade models cannot explain the densities required by any of the likely models. It is harder to account for the mysterious High-Frequency Interpulse. We understand neither its origin within the magnetosphere nor the striking emission bands in its dynamic spectrum. The most promising models are based on analogies with solar zebra bands, but they require unusual plasma structures which are not part of our standard picture of the magnetosphere.

30|$|Regarding human factors, in {{addition}} to fatigue, carelessness, stress, health, situation awareness, mistakes, inadequate training, and safety culture, others relate to tug boat drivers’ skills, and the English communication abilities of VTC regulators and marine pilots [23]. Both individual and group factors are important. One key element is safety climate, or how employee perceptions and expectations relate to organisational safety [24]. This can be influenced by many factors. For example, institutional and social behaviour were noted to underpin the swift responses to the Fukushima nuclear disaster [25]. Often, ‘culture’ is considered highly important, {{especially in terms of}} having a safety culture (e.g. [26]) and not one that ‘blames the victims’ [27, 28]. It is argued that management must be proactive in implementing training and safety culture, and should not wait “for it to come <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> else <b>in</b> <b>the</b> organisation” ([6], pp. 446). Further, employment conditions can influence port safety. For example, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Fukushima disaster, swift communication by workers from the German Hapag Lloyd company with strong unions greatly emphasising employee protection were found to improve safety [25]. In contrast, temporary employment conditions, less experience amongst the workers, and downsizing, have been argued to place greater strain on workers and adversely affected port safety [4]. Thus many studies show the importance and relevance of a huge range of human factors.|$|R
