25|$|On 5 September 2006, Huntley {{was found}} {{unconscious}} in his prison cell and {{thought to have}} taken an overdose. He had previously taken an overdose of antidepressants in prison in June 2003 while awaiting his trial. He was under police guard in hospital for two days, before being returned to Wakefield prison, prompting much reaction from many present at the scene, as well as making {{the front pages of}} many of the UK newspapers the next morning. Following this attempted suicide, his cell was cleared and a tape was found which was marked with Queen on one side and Meat Loaf on the other. This tape is thought to contain confessions from Huntley on what he did and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it. It is believed that Huntley made the tape in return for antidepressants from a fellow prisoner, who hoped to obtain and later sell the confession to the media after his release. On 28 March 2007, The Sun began publishing transcripts of Huntley's taped confession.|$|E
25|$|In 1982 the Grand Nationals {{at least}} as far as the {{professionals}} were concerned was a one-event championship. Instead of how much was won over the year, the Pros were required to attend at least eight nationals with the top 28 money-winning pros, A or AA, eligible to compete in a special pro Car main in which the winning pro would receive a 1983 General Motors Pontiac Trans Am automobile and the title no. 1 Pro for 1982, continuing the new tradition of giving the number one pro a Trans Am. Kevin McNeal, No. 1 Pro for 1981 also received one, so did Brian's brother Brent in 1980. Brian Patterson was the pro who had earned the most money prior to the Grand National with $3,694 in winnings, so if the previous system of winning the number one plate was still in force, depending on <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> he probably would have won under the old system. Indeed, the situation would have been similar to Kevin McNeal, Brian Patterson had maintained the money lead since May.|$|E

[...] The novel was adapted in 1958 by X Minus One into a radio teleplay and broadcast on July 3, 1956. In a 1977 interview Sturgeon commented that it was his concerns about the ongoing McCarthy Hearings that prompted him to write the story.|$|E

[...] While basketball player Michael Jordan was Scott's childhood sports idol, he says Jordan was not the inspiration for his jersey number of 23.

Clark Davey of The Globe and Mail stated, [...] "We did not know <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it." [...] Reporters thought the Progressive Conservatives might, at best, gain 30 or 35seats over the 53 they had at dissolution, and when Diefenbaker, off the record, told the reporters that the Tories would win 97 seats (which would still allow the Liberals to form the government), they concluded he was guilty of wishful thinking. Diefenbaker was even more confident in public; after he concluded his national tour {{and returned to his}} constituency, he addressed his final rally in Nipawin, Saskatchewan: [...] "On Monday, I'll be Prime Minister." ...|$|E

500|$|Hoffman's older brother, Glenn, {{was nine}} years older and played shortstop in the Boston Red Sox organization. During summer {{vacation}} when Hoffman was 10 years old, he joined Glenn while he was playing in Pawtucket. His oldest brother, Greg, was 14 years Hoffman's senior and a mentor to his two younger brothers. [...] After Hoffman's first Little League game, Greg asked him <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> Hoffman responded, [...] "I went 2-for-4, double, RBI." [...] to which Greg replied, [...] "That'll be the last (blanking) time {{you tell me how}} you did. When I ask you how you did, it's how the team did." [...] Hoffman never forgot that. Given their age difference, Hoffman considered his brothers more role models than playmates. [...] " [...] was the guide while Greg was the drill instructor", said Hoffman.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{intended}} to be released as a mixtape; with tracks linked through interludes and turntable effects, but was then changed to be set up like a film.

You've even got a 'Pause for Porno.' It's got everything that a movie needs." [...] Speaking of <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not record the album for club or radio play and that he planned the album simply for entertainment with comical aspects throughout, he commented [...] "I'm not trying to send out any messages or anything with this record. I just basically do hard-core hip-hop and try to add a touch of dark comedy here and there. A lot of times the media just takes this and tries to make it into something else when it's all entertainment first. You shouldn't take it too seriously." ...|$|E

He {{expressed a desire to}} work with André 3000, Kid Cudi, and Sade for the album. In {{an interview}} for MTV, Drake cited Nas and André 3000 as influences for parts of Thank Me Later, stating [...] "Nas was somebody that I used to listen to his raps and never understood <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it. I always wanted to understand how he painted those pictures and his bar structure. I went back and really studied Nas and André 3000 and then came back with this album". In comparing the album to his previous work, he stated [...] "It's gonna be bigger, it's gonna sound happier. More victorious, 'cause that's where I'm at in my life".

500|$|Other reviewers {{were less}} enthusiastic. The Daily Telegraphs Catherine Taylor found the protagonist [...] "a little too credulous." [...] She also found McEwan's [...] "wilful {{narrative}} sadism" [...] sadly {{missing from the}} work. The review in The Economist was even more scathing: referring to Sweet Tooth as [...] "not Mr McEwan's finest book", the reviewer concluded that by the end, [...] "it is hard to feel much of anything for these heroes, who are all notions and no depth." [...] James Lasdun of The Guardian {{found that there were}} [...] "momentous political questions" [...] raised in the earlier parts of the novel, which were not fully addressed by the end. Stylistically, Serena found herself caught in exactly the kind of narrative she disliked, but, asked Lasdun, [...] "to what end?" [...] Particularly the ending of the book was polarising. Kellaway saw it as [...] "a good excuse {{to go back to the}} beginning and read this rich and enjoyable novel all over again", while another reviewer confessed that, though the ending [...] "might be enough to send McEwan acolytes scurrying back through the novel to see <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it... it made me want to throw the book out the window." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1906, Hirst {{completed}} an unprecedented double of 2,000 runs and 200 wickets. Cricket writer A. A. Thomson noted that both milestones were unusual individually, {{and that such}} all-round achievements had only been matched in scope by those of W. G. Grace in the 1870s. No other cricketer has come close to matching this particular double. Hirst reached the 1,000 run–100 wicket double {{by the end of}} June, two weeks faster {{than anyone else in the}} history of first-class cricket. In total he scored 2,385 first-class runs at an average of 45.86 and took 208 wickets at 16.50. Hirst's contributions were particularly important in a close race for the County Championship. Kent were eventual champions after Yorkshire lost a close game to Gloucestershire, but Hirst performed well in the two matches against Kent. He scored a century and took 11 wickets as Yorkshire won the first, and took eight wickets and scored a match-saving 93 in the drawn second encounter. Against the other title contenders, Lancashire and Surrey, he was likewise successful with both bat and ball, earning praise from The Times and Wisden for his batting under difficult circumstances in these matches. His captain, Lord Hawke, said [...] "It was not only what Georgie Hirst did but <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it, coming off [...] when an effort seemed most necessary and playing his best against the more formidable sides." [...] He scored six centuries, two of which came in a record-equalling performance against Somerset. He scored 111 and 117 not out when batting and took six for 70 and five for 45 with the ball. He became only the second man after Bernard Bosanquet to score two centuries and take 10 wickets in the same first-class match; as of 2015, only one other man, Franklyn Stephenson in 1988, has achieved the feat. Battling a knee injury and exhaustion towards the end of the season, it became increasingly difficult for Hirst to perform. Hirst took his 200th wicket at the end of August and commented that, were his feat to be duplicated in future, [...] "whoever does will be very tired". He also commented that his injuries only troubled him once the season was over and it [...] "was a triumph of spirit over matter".|$|E

In 129 playoff games, he had eighty-five goals and seventy-five assists. When he retired, he held the record for most goals per season average with 57.3.
