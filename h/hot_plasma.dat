It is a nearly perfect sphere of <b>hot</b> <b>plasma,</b> with {{internal}} convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers, i.e. 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|This highly {{hypothetical}} {{picture of}} the flux tube exchange was partly confirmed by the Galileo spacecraft, which detected regions of sharply reduced plasma density and increased field strength in the inner magnetosphere. These voids may correspond to the almost empty flux tubes arriving from the outer magnetosphere. In the middle magnetosphere, Galileo detected so-called injection events, which occur when <b>hot</b> <b>plasma</b> from the outer magnetosphere impacts the magnetodisk, leading to increased flux of energetic particles and a strengthened magnetic field. No mechanism is yet known to explain the transport of cold plasma outward.|$|E

Its two major consequences – exclusion of the Big Bang and {{a new way to}} stabilize hot fusion in the ITER – stand not alone. Thirdly the thermodynamics of <b>hot</b> <b>plasmas</b> is profoundly altered. The correct fundamental theory underlying <b>hot</b> <b>plasmas</b> is not thermodynamics any more, and not cryodynamics taken alone; it rather is a new hybrid theory across the two: thermo-cryodynamics.

40|$|The {{physics of}} <b>hot</b> <b>plasmas</b> {{is of great}} {{importance}} for describing many phenomena in the universe and is fundamental for the prospect of future fusion energy production on Earth. Nontrivial results of nonlinear electromagnetic effects in plasmas include the self-organization and self-formation in the plasma of structures compact in time and space. These are the consequences of competing processes of nonlinear interactions and can be best described using reaction-diffusion equations.

This method races <b>hot</b> <b>plasma</b> {{around in a}} magnetically confined, donut-shaped ring, with an internal current. When completed, ITER will be the world's largest tokamak.

40|$|Derivation of the modulational {{instability}} {{characteristics of}} whistlers in cold and <b>hot</b> <b>plasmas.</b> The cold-plasma analysis considers both ion motion and relativistic effects; the unstable band, with a growth rate proportional to (B/B sub zero) squared, is contiguous to Omega sub e/ 4 and, {{depending on the}} plasma density, lies above or below that frequency (Omega sub e is the electron cyclotron frequency of the static magnetic field; B and B sub zero are the whistler and static magnetic fields). In <b>hot</b> <b>plasmas,</b> stability occurs between Omega sub e/ 4 and Omega prime (less than Omega sub e), with Omega prime depending mainly on the mean energy and anisotropy of the energetic electron population; the complementary unstable band has a growth rate proportional to (B/B sub zero) to the 1 / 2 power. The relevance of the instability to whistlers in the magnetosphere is discussed...|$|R
25|$|A {{stellarator}} is {{a device}} used to confine a <b>hot</b> <b>plasma</b> with magnetic fields {{in order to}} sustain a controlled nuclear fusion reaction. It is the earliest controlled fusion device. In 1951, American astrophysicist Lyman Spitzer recommended that the United States Atomic Energy Commission commence containing and harnessing nuclear fusion of hydrogen at temperatures exceeding those at the Sun's surface. To do this, Spitzer invented a plasma confinement configuration device called the stellarator.|$|E
25|$|Stellarator: Twisted {{rings of}} <b>hot</b> <b>plasma.</b> The {{stellarator}} attempts {{to create a}} natural twist plasma path, using external magnets, while tokamaks create those magnetic fields using an internal current. Stellarators were developed by Lyman Spitzer in 1950 and have four designs: Torsatron, Heliotron, Heliac and Helias. One example is Wendelstein 7-X, a German fusion device that produced its first plasma on December 10, 2015. It is the world's largest stellarator, designed to investigate the suitability {{of this type of}} device for a power station.|$|E
25|$|From the {{observed}} X-ray spectrum, combined with spectral emission results for other wavelength ranges, an astronomical model addressing the likely source of X-ray emission can be constructed. For example, with Scorpius X-1 the X-ray spectrum steeply drops off as X-ray energy increases up to 20 keV, {{which is likely}} for a thermal-plasma mechanism. In addition, there is no radio emission, and the visible continuum is roughly what would be expected from a <b>hot</b> <b>plasma</b> fitting {{the observed}} X-ray flux. The plasma could be a coronal cloud of a central object or a transient plasma, where the energy source is unknown, but {{could be related to}} the idea of a close binary.|$|E

25|$|The Sun's major {{component}} of magnetic field reverses direction every 11 years (so the period is about 22 years), resulting in a diminished magnitude of magnetic field near reversal time. During this dormancy, the sunspots activity is at maximum (because {{of the lack of}} magnetic braking on plasma) and, as a result, massive ejection of high energy plasma into the solar corona and interplanetary space takes place. Collisions of neighboring sunspots with oppositely directed magnetic fields result in the generation of strong electric fields near rapidly disappearing magnetic field regions. This electric field accelerates electrons and protons to high energies (kiloelectronvolts) which results in jets of extremely <b>hot</b> <b>plasma</b> leaving the Sun's surface and heating coronal plasma to high temperatures (millions of kelvin).|$|E
25|$|For both Jupiter and Saturn, {{transport}} of plasma {{from the inner}} to the outer parts of the magnetosphere {{is thought to be}} related to interchange instability. In the case of Saturn, magnetic flux tubes loaded with cold, waterrich plasma interchange with flux tubes filled with <b>hot</b> <b>plasma</b> arriving from the outer magnetosphere. The instability is driven by centrifugal force exerted by the plasma on the magnetic field. The cold plasma is eventually removed from the magnetosphere by plasmoids formed when the magnetic field reconnects in the magnetotail. The plasmoids move down the tail and escape from the magnetosphere. The reconnection or substorm process is thought to be {{under the control of the}} solar wind and Saturn's largest moon Titan, which orbits near the outer boundary of the magnetosphere.|$|E
25|$|In 1949 an {{expatriate}} German, Ronald Richter, {{proposed the}} Huemul Project in Argentina, announcing positive results in 1951. These {{turned out to}} be fake, but it prompted considerable interest in the concept as a whole. In particular, it prompted Lyman Spitzer to begin considering ways to solve some of the more obvious problems involved in confining a <b>hot</b> <b>plasma,</b> and, unaware of the z-pinch efforts, he developed a new solution to the problem known as the stellarator. Spitzer applied to the US Atomic Energy Commission for funding to build a test device. During this period, Jim Tuck who had worked with the UK teams had been introducing the z-pinch concept to his coworkers at his new job at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). When he heard of Spitzer's pitch for funding, he applied to build a machine of his own, the Perhapsatron.|$|E

500|$|Under {{sufficiently}} extreme conditions, quarks {{may become}} deconfined and exist as free particles. In {{the course of}} asymptotic freedom, the strong interaction becomes weaker at higher temperatures. Eventually, color confinement would be lost and an extremely <b>hot</b> <b>plasma</b> of freely moving quarks and gluons would be formed.

500|$|While Earth's {{magnetic}} field is roughly teardrop-shaped, Jupiter's is flatter, more closely resembling a disk, and [...] "wobbles" [...] periodically about its axis.

The magnetodisk has a thin current sheet at the middle plane, approximately near the magnetic equator. The magnetic field lines point away from Jupiter above the sheet and towards Jupiter below it. The load of plasma from Io greatly expands {{the size of the}} Jovian magnetosphere, because the magnetodisk creates an additional internal pressure which balances the pressure of the solar wind. In the absence of Io the distance from the planet to the magnetopause at the subsolar point would be no more than 42RJ, whereas it is actually 75RJ on average.|$|E
