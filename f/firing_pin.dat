5|$|Advancements in {{microscopic}} stamping {{have led}} to a push for the inclusion of <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> microstamping. The microstamp is etched onto the <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> and is transferred to the cartridge during the firing process. Each <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> would have a unique serial number allowing investigators to trace casings found at a crime scene to a known firearm. The practice is not in use , although California has enacted legislation that requires microstamping on all newly sold firearms. The law, and microstamping in general, has received significant opposition from gun manufacturers due to increased costs associated with introducing the microstamps into the manufacturing lines.|$|E
5|$|When {{the trigger}} was pulled, the spring pushed the <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> {{forwards}} into the bomb, which ignited the propellant in the bomb and launched {{it out of}} the trough and into the air. The recoil caused by the detonation of the propellant then blew the <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> backwards onto the spring; this automatically cocked the weapon for subsequent shots, eliminating the need to manually re-cock.|$|E
5|$|By {{examining}} unique striations, or markings, {{left behind}} on the bullet as it passes through the barrel and on the cartridge as it is hit by the <b>firing</b> <b>pin,</b> individual spent rounds can be linked back to a specific weapon. Known exemplars taken from a seized weapon can be directly compared to samples recovered from the scene using a comparison microscope. Striation images can also be uploaded to any existing national databases. Furthermore, these markings {{can be compared to}} other images in an attempt to link one weapon to multiple crime scenes. Like all forensic specialties, forensic firearm examiners are subject to being called to testify in court as expert witnesses.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} factory <b>firing</b> <b>pins</b> for the CZ 52 {{were made}} of weak cast metal and due to their design are known to break during dry firing [...] which should be avoided. Aftermarket machined <b>firing</b> <b>pins</b> such as those manufactured by Harrington Products can eliminate this problem.|$|R
5000|$|Some pepperboxes {{fired the}} lower barrel {{instead of the}} upper, such as the Belgian Marriette (in {{configurations}} with between 4 and 24 barrels), the American Blunt & Syms or the English Cooper. Usually these employed an [...] "underhammer" [...] action, with the hammer mounted under the frame, behind the barrels, forward of the trigger (often a ring-trigger). Several other types of firing mechanisms exist, such as rotating internal <b>firing</b> <b>pins</b> (Rigby, Robbins and Lawrence, Comblain), rotating <b>firing</b> <b>pins</b> on a hammer (Sharps, Grunbaum) or multiple <b>firing</b> <b>pins</b> (Martin).|$|R
60|$|Finally the warheads {{themselves}} were carried {{off and the}} <b>firing</b> <b>pins</b> removed.|$|R
5|$|Spent {{cartridges}} {{found at}} a scene can be examined for physical evidence such as fingerprints or compared to samples that match them to a weapon. The examination of the cartridge relies on the unique tool marks left by the {{various parts of the}} weapon including the <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> and the ejector in semi and fully automatic firearms. These markings can be compared and matched to known exemplars fired from the same weapon using the same parts. The examination of the marks left on the cartridge is done using a comparison microscope. Examiners view the questioned cartridge and the known exemplar simultaneously, looking for similar microscopic marks left during the firing process.|$|E
5|$|Sayid {{escapes from}} Rousseau's bunker {{while she is}} gone, {{grabbing}} a rifle, maps and notes she has made about the island. Rousseau finds him {{and they have a}} standoff; he tries to fire the rifle, but no bullet discharges. Rousseau says she removed the <b>firing</b> <b>pin,</b> and Robert, her former lover, made the same mistake before she killed him. She reveals that it was she who killed her team, aiming to stop the disease from reaching the outside world. Sayid talks Rousseau into letting him go, but, before leaving, asks about Alex. Rousseau says that Alex was her child. While trying to find his way back to camp, Sayid hears the whispering of which Rousseau had spoken.|$|E
5|$|To {{initiate}} {{firing the}} weapon the trigger mechanism, which was essentially just a large spring, {{had to be}} cocked, and to do this was a difficult and awkward process. The user had to first place the PIAT on its butt, then place two feet on the shoulder padding and turn the weapon to unlock the body and simultaneously lock the <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> to the butt; the user would then have to bend over and pull {{the body of the}} weapon upwards, thereby pulling the spring back until it attached to the trigger and cocking the weapon. Once this was achieved, the body was then lowered and turned to reattach it {{to the rest of the}} weapon, and the PIAT could then be fired. Users of a small stature often found the cocking sequence challenging, as they did not have the sufficient height required to pull the body up far enough to cock the weapon; it was also difficult to do when lying in a prone position, as was often the case when using the weapon in action.|$|E
50|$|Many <b>firing</b> <b>pins</b> are stamped from sheet steel, {{forming a}} {{rectangular}} cross-section {{rather than a}} round one. These will often have a cylindrical section at the front rather than a hemispherical one, and are fairly common in rimfire firearms. Sturm, Ruger, for example, uses sheet metal <b>firing</b> <b>pins</b> in its 10/22 carbine and Mark II pistol.|$|R
50|$|Mechanisms {{involving}} <b>firing</b> <b>pins</b> {{can be used}} also {{in other}} pyrotechnical systems, ranging from hand grenades to chemical oxygen generators.|$|R
50|$|It is {{generally}} acceptable to dry fire more modern centerfire firearms without a cartridge or snap cap. Older designs {{such as the}} CZ 52 and Colt Single Action Army are exceptions. However, dry firing a rimfire firearm, striker based firearms or guns with angled <b>firing</b> <b>pins</b> (such as revolvers with hammer-mounted <b>firing</b> <b>pins</b> or older shotguns) can damage the gun. Furthermore, damage can occur to the chamber mouth of a rimfire firearm. Ultimately, one should check with the manufacturer of the gun to ascertain if {{it is safe to}} dry fire.|$|R
25|$|The {{standard}} {{models have}} an ambidextrous manual safety/decocker {{located on the}} slide; when the safety lever is lowered to the safe position, the <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> is cammed into the slide away from the hammer, the trigger is disconnected from the sear, and the hammer is decocked. The decocker models have no manual safety; instead, when the lever is lowered, it only cams the <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> into the slide and drops the hammer. When the lever is released, the <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> springs back to the normal position. The DAO models have no manual safety or decocker. All models feature an automatic <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> safety that blocks the <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> unless the trigger is pulled fully rearward.|$|E
25|$|Early P85 pistols were {{recalled}} for {{a safety}} issue {{that resulted in}} one accidental discharge. If the <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> broke {{in front of the}} <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> block, applying the safety, which dropped the hammer, could transfer enough energy to the broken <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> to cause a discharge. The P85 was recalled, and a new safety was installed that prevented contact between <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> and hammer during a decocking operation. This modification was done free of charge. The P85 MKII was released with the safety fix, larger safety levers, improved accuracy, and the option of a stainless-steel slide.|$|E
25|$|Early torpedoes used contact {{exploder}}s. A typical exploder had a <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> {{that stuck}} {{out from the}} warhead and was restrained by a transverse shear pin. The torpedo would hit the target with enough energy to break the shear pin and allow the <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> to strike a percussion cap that ultimately detonated the warhead. An arming impeller was an additional safety device: the <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> could not move until the torpedo had travelled a preset distance.|$|E
50|$|Typically, <b>firing</b> <b>pins</b> or strikers {{are made}} from steel, {{aluminum}} alloy or titanium. However, for specialist applications such as zero metal mines, non-metallic materials are used e.g. glass ceramic.|$|R
50|$|Despite slight {{design changes}} since 1960, {{there is general}} {{backwards}} compatibility of nearly all internal parts. Some notable parts that are year-specific are the feed throat mechanisms, magazine tubes, <b>firing</b> <b>pins,</b> and hammers.|$|R
50|$|During the Second World War, the ATF {{plant in}} Elizabeth was {{converted}} almost entirely over to military production. Barth Casters {{were used to}} make <b>firing</b> <b>pins</b> and ATF operated two plants in Newark making ordnance.|$|R
25|$|The pistol {{is fired}} {{by a single}} action hammer, and has a manual safety switch on the slide. The ambidextrous safety switch rotates a drum {{mechanism}} which sits over the <b>firing</b> <b>pin,</b> causing the <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> to lock in, which prevents it from moving forward and reduces {{the possibility of the}} gun discharging accidentally. With the safety off, pulling the trigger releases the hammer to fall downward, hitting the <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> and causing the chambered round to discharge.|$|E
25|$|The Contender frame has two firing pins, and a {{selector}} on {{the exposed}} hammer, {{to allow the}} shooter to choose between rimfire or centerfire firing pins, or to select a safety position from which neither <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> can strike a primer. The initial baseline design of the Contender had no central safe position on the hammer, having only centerfire and rimfire <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> positions, each being selectable through using a screwdriver.|$|E
25|$|The contact pistol {{frequently}} {{failed to}} fire the warhead. It often jammed with a textbook right angle hit to a ship's side as the <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> could not take {{the shock of the}} impact.|$|E
50|$|During {{the period}} of Islamic {{influence}} within the Iberian peninsula, the castro was reinforced {{to serve as an}} outpost. The fortification controlled one of the principal routes of passage into the Algarve. Of the artifacts discovered there are objects dating to the pre- and proto-cultural episodes of the region, including: polished stone axes, fragments of Iron Age vessels, rural ceramics, glass beads, gold, needle bone, bronze bracelets, drills, <b>firing</b> <b>pins,</b> spheroids; historical objects: Roman-Visigoth ceramics, Arabic and Portuguese Medieval metal objects (screws, cossoiros, buckles, keys, rings, etc.), stone objects (millstones, spheroids throwing, <b>firing</b> <b>pins),</b> hewn Roman and Visigothic stones, Arab tombstones, coins, Roman lamps.|$|R
50|$|Using a {{specialized}} cartridge, the Groza has no <b>firing</b> <b>pins</b> {{in a traditional}} sense. When fired, an internal piston within the cartridge launches the bullet forward and retains all the gases within the barrel, thus making a near silent weapon.|$|R
50|$|The Saturn {{machine pistol}} is of Colombian origin, {{and it is}} {{designed}} for clandestine operations. The weapon is twin barreled and is fed from a dual magazine. The weapon has one bolt with two <b>firing</b> <b>pins.</b> An unusual dual barrel suppressor {{can be used on}} this firearm.|$|R
25|$|Three {{variants}} {{of the original}} Contender design were later developed, distinguished easily by the hammer design. The first variant has a push button selector on the hammer for choosing rimfire vs. centerfire, the second variant has a left-center-right toggle switch for selecting center fire-safe-rimfire firing pins, and the third variant has a horizontal bolt selection for choosing center fire-safe-rimfire <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> positions. All three of these Contender variants have a cougar etched {{on the sides of}} the receiver, thereby easily distinguishing them from the later G2 Contender which has a smooth-sided receiver without an etched cougar. Some of the very earliest Contenders, those requiring a screwdriver to switch the <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> between rimfire and centerfire, had smooth sides, without the cougar etched on the sides.|$|E
25|$|The SR9 boasts {{multiple}} {{safety devices}} such an ambidextrous manual thumb safety and magazine release, a loaded chamber indicator, a visual and tactile cocked-striker indicator, and a <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> block safety which prevents the pistol from firing {{if it is}} accidentally dropped. The SR9 also features a magazine disconnector.|$|E
25|$|Pearl Harbor made working exploders {{by using}} lighter weight {{aluminum}} parts. Reducing the mass reduces the binding friction. BuOrd suggested using a stiffer spring, the fix that had worked decades before. In the end, BuOrd adopted a ball switch and electric detonator {{rather than using}} a <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> mechanism.|$|E
25|$|Parts {{that are}} subject to high {{pressures}} and sharp impacts are still commonly case-hardened. Examples include <b>firing</b> <b>pins</b> and rifle bolt faces, or engine camshafts. In these cases, the surfaces requiring the hardness may be hardened selectively, leaving {{the bulk of the}} part in its original tough state.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} type of flare gun is a Very (sometimes spelled Verey), which was named after Edward Wilson Very (1847-1910), an American naval officer who {{developed}} and popularized a single-shot breech-loading snub-nosed pistol that fired flares (Very flares). They have a single action trigger mechanism, hammer action, center <b>fire</b> <b>pin.</b> [...] Modern varieties are frequently made out of brightly colored, durable plastic.|$|R
40|$|Construction is not {{possible}} without joining single parts to components {{and at the end}} to the final structure. There exist multifarious kinds of connections whose suitability mainly depends on the characteristic of raw material the structural parts are made of. This article especially deals with joints in metallic light weight structures. Beside the typical connections in metal structures like welding, bolting and riveting in metallic light weight structures further kinds of connections can be found like standing seam, clinch, punch rivet or cartridge <b>fired</b> <b>pin</b> connections. Describing all these single methods would go {{beyond the scope of this}} article. That is why only the predominant part of all connections with so called pencil-shaped fastening elements like screwed connections, blind riveted connections and connections with cartridge <b>fired</b> <b>pins</b> will be dealt with. Furthermore the scope of application will be shown, advantages and disadvantages will be compared, the determination of characteristic values or resistance will be shortly explained and advices for calculation and execution will be given...|$|R
25|$|Firearms use {{triggers}} {{to initiate}} the firing of a cartridge in the firing chamber of the weapon. This is accomplished by actuating a striking device {{through a combination of}} spring and kinetic energy operating through a <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> to strike and ignite the primer. There are two primary types of striking mechanisms, hammers and strikers. Hammers are spring-tensioned masses of metal that pivot on a pin when released and strike a <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> to discharge a cartridge. Strikers are, essentially, spring-loaded firing pins that travel on an axis in-line with the cartridge eliminating the need for a separate hammer. The connection between the trigger and the hammer is generally referred to as the sear surface. Variable mechanisms will have this surface directly on the trigger and hammer or have separate sears or other connecting parts.|$|E
25|$|Colt Government Mk. IV Series 80 (1983–present): Introduced an {{internal}} <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> safety {{and a new}} half-cock notch on the sear; pulling the trigger on these models while at half-cock will cause the hammer to drop. Models after 1988 returned to the solid barrel bushing due to concerns about breakages.|$|E
25|$|Load each chamber in {{sequence}} (original), setting the hammer {{in the safety}} notch when finished; or (safe and prudent method) load one chamber, skip the next, load the remaining four chambers, close the loading gate, draw the hammer to full cock and lower fully, {{making sure that the}} <b>firing</b> <b>pin</b> is over the empty chamber.|$|E
40|$|Since the 1993 {{court case}} of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc. the {{subjective}} nature of toolmark comparison {{has been questioned}} by attorneys and law enforcement agencies alike. This {{has led to an}} increased drive to establish objective comparison techniques with known error rates, much like those that DNA analysis is able to provide. This push has created research in which the 3 -D surface profile of two different marks are characterized and the marks 2 ̆ 7 cross-sections are run through a comparative statistical algorithm to acquire a value that is intended to indicate the likelihood of a match between the marks. The aforementioned algorithm has been developed and extensively tested through comparison of evenly striated marks made by screwdrivers. However, this algorithm has yet to be applied to quasi-striated marks such as those made by the shear edge of slip-joint pliers. The results of this algorithm 2 ̆ 7 s application to the surface of copper wire will be presented. Objective mark comparison also extends to comparison of toolmarks made by firearms. In an effort to create objective comparisons, microstamping of <b>firing</b> <b>pins</b> and breech faces has been introduced. This process involves placing unique alphanumeric identifiers surrounded by a radial code on the surface of <b>firing</b> <b>pins,</b> which transfer to the cartridge 2 ̆ 7 s primer upon firing. Three different guns equipped with microstamped <b>firing</b> <b>pins</b> were used to fire 3000 cartridges. These cartridges are evaluated based on the clarity of their alphanumeric transfers and the clarity of the radial code surrounding the alphanumerics...|$|R

25|$|The {{first sign}} the Americans had of the enemy's {{proximity}} was a Cuban Army soldier lying dead by the road. The engagement began with shots by U.S. artillery. Spanish infantry returned <b>fire,</b> <b>pinning</b> down the advancing American units with rifle volleys. The Spaniards were armed with superior 7mm 1893 model Mauser repetition rifles that fired round after round of smokeless gunpowder, making them exceedingly difficult to target in return.|$|R
