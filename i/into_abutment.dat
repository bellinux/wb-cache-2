50|$|The bridge site is locate just {{southwest}} of the village of Stockbridge Four Corners, which is formed by a right-angle turn of Vermont Route 100 and its junction with Stockbridge Common Road and Blackmer Boulevard. Vermont 100 runs west from the junction, and then crosses the river before bending to parallel the river running further southwest. The present bridge, constructed in 2008-2009, is a steel girder bridge whose deck is integrated <b>into</b> its <b>abutments.</b> The bridge is curved to accommodate {{the transition from the}} crossing to the southwest continuation of the roadway.|$|R
50|$|Thrusts {{downward}} {{on such a}} bridge's deck are translated, as tension, by vertical ties of {{the deck}} to the curved top chord, tending to flatten it and thereby to push its tips outward <b>into</b> the <b>abutments,</b> like other arch bridges. However, in a tied-arch or bowstring bridge, these movements are restrained not by the abutments but by the bottom chord, which ties these tips together, taking the thrusts as tension, rather like the string of a bow that is being flattened. Therefore, the design is often called a bowstring-arch or bowstring-girder bridge.|$|R

Some specialties, like a solution of sidewalks for cyclists and pedestrians by combination of steel and timber members, are presented. Anchorage of balancing hangers <b>into</b> an <b>abutment</b> by manner of prestressed rods represents another non-traditional solution. Pressured concreting of pylons and part of main girders was applied, too. The bridge was built to substitute an old cable-stayed footbridge, which was removed {{as soon as the}} new bridge structure had been completed. The new bridge was officially opened on June 11, 2011.

50|$|The {{bridge was}} rebuilt in 1998 after the Northridge {{earthquake}} due to {{concerns that the}} structure would not be stable {{in the event of}} an earthquake in the Franklin Hills area.

The expansion joints were also removed, so the bridge deck is now a one-piece structural diaphragm built to transfer all seismic forces <b>into</b> the <b>abutment</b> walls at either end of the bridge. All of the rebuilding was done in an effort to preserve the historic appearance of the bridge.|$|R

Gauges measured the longitudinal strain in the girders and deck and were positioned at different elevations to provide a strain distribution across the superstructure depth. From the strain data, moments were computed at each of the installation locations. Data indicate that the superstructure responds to thermal fluctuations as expected with midspan moments smaller in magnitude when compared to the moments measured at the abutment and pier locations. Furthermore, data confirm that the level of sun exposure affects the thermally-induced moments measured in the girders...|$|R

Caption: "Catapulting 240 feet down a roadside ditch, this old sedan rammed <b>into</b> a bridge <b>abutment</b> near Wheatland early Saturday, resulting in critical injuries to two persons. " Two Oklahoma City residents were critically injured, and a highway patrol trooper narrowly escaped death early Saturday in related incidents connected to a one-car crash near Wheatland. Being treated at Mercy hospital are Lee Edmond Moore, 39, of 1101 SW 17, and Georgia Harding 31, of 2122 SW 11. Moore and the Harding woman were injured when their 1949 sedan shot off SH 152, careened 240 feet out of control down a bar-ditch and rammed head on into a concrete bridge. They both suffered head and chest injuries, multiple lacerations of the scalp and face and internal injuries. X-rays were being taken to determine extent of injuries. Both were pinned in the car, although Moore managed to extricate himself, and climb back to the road. He said that several motorists passed him {{before he could get}} one to stop and then call an ambulance. The Harding woman was rescued from the car by Oklahoma scout car officers Ray LeGrande and Larry Frankford, who offered assistance when they intercepted a radio massage that a patrol had crashed into a ditch. Highway Patrol trooper Red Arthur, en route to the crash scene, was forced to steer his patrol unit headlong into a ditch to avoid crashing into a drunk driver riding {{down the middle of the}} highway with his bright lights on. "It was either hit the ditch or be killed," the veteran trooper said at Mercy Hospital. "I was traveling code 3 (red lights, spotlight and siren working), and that guy was right in the middle of the road. I couldn't have stopped or missed him under any circumstances without taking off for the ditch. " Arthur said his patrol unit slid into the shallow ditch, skidded more than 75 feet and rammed into a mud bank. The force of the slide completely mired the unit, and Arthur was powerless to do anything about it until a motorist came along and pulled the patrol car out. The driver of the other car failed to stop to see if he could offer assistance, and Arthur was unable to get a tag number or other identification on the car. At the spot where the Moore car rammed into the bridge the roadway spans a creek-bed almost 20 feet deep.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{in vitro}} the sealing capability at the prosthetic connection interface of 2 conometric systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two conometric systems {{with the same}} design and different material were used, {{for a total of}} 24 samples. Each sample was assembled by a tapered abutment and respective coping. In group A, the copings were made of gold, whereas in group B they were made of PEEK. Three μL of mix bacterial suspension (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum species) was inoculated <b>into</b> the <b>abutment</b> screw hole, and the coping was inserted on the abutment. Samples were immersed into culture tubes and incubated for 24, 48, and 72 hours into anaerobic conditions. Visual evaluation of turbidity was performed at each time point. Qualitative-quantitative assessment using real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed at 72 hours. Any difference between the groups was checked by means of Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Microbial leakage occurred in both groups, and there was no statistically significant difference between groups. Microbial concentration resulted in a presence inferior to 1 × 10 copies/μL in all positive assemblies.

40|$|Masonry arch bridges are {{typically}} historical infrastructures that were often {{not designed to}} withstand the heavy truck traffic that they are currently carrying and therefore must be replaced by modern concrete or steel bridges. Usual methods of strengthening masonry bridges are neither simple nor economical. This paper investigates whether the application of composites {{in the form of}} either a fabric wrap or laminate strips to masonry constructions, may increase the load-bearing capacity of these structures. This research project demonstrates how advanced composite materials can be used to strengthen existing masonry arch bridges in order to increase their load-baering capacity. This paper details the methodology adopted to retrofit and repair the Castagnara masonry bridge in Padua (Italy) and the investigations related to the damage of the bridge, the retrofiting by fibre reinforced plastic (FRP) and the results of the consolidation. Retrofitting involves the insertion of a prestressed steel cable <b>into</b> the <b>abutments,</b> consolidating injections, bonding by FRP strips on the extrados of the deck and demolition and reconstruction of the reinforced concrete slab. Linear-elastic and non-linear dynamic analysis of the bridge have been performed. Detailed finite element models (FEM) and on-site dynamic acceleration measurements were used to evaluate retrofit performance. Results show that applying carbon fabric to the masonry bridges provides significant increases in bending and shear capacity. However, a statistically significant number of masonry structures strengthened with carbon fibres need to be tested to arrive at definitive stress modification factors...|$|R

This study was to detect the resistance of inter-joined zirconia abutment with different angle loading for clinical applications. Materials and Methods: The inter-joined abutments were shaped with the technique of injection of zirconia powder in nanometers. Sixty 0 sstem GS 5. 0 mm× 10 mm implants were used with 30 zirconia abutments and 30 0 sstem GStitanium abutments for fixation using 40 N torque force. The loading applications included 90 °, 30 °, 0 ° formed by the long axis of abutments and pressure head of universal test machine. The fracture resistances of zirconia and titanium abutments were documented and analyzed. Results: The inter-joined zirconia abutments were assembled to the 0 sstem GSimplants succssfully. In the 90 ° loading mode, the fracture resistance of zirconia abutment group and titanium abutment group were 301. 46 ± 15. 38 N, 736. 36 ± 120. 10 N respectively. And those in the 30 °groups were 434. 66 ± 36. 07 N, 1073. 12 ± 73. 96 N correspondingly. Significant difference {{in the two groups}} was found through T Test.

40|$|Earthen dams {{are often}} built <b>into</b> bedrock <b>abutments</b> and on bedrock foundations. Bedrock joints {{naturally}} occur in bedrock materials. These bedrock joints create voids for ground water to pass through. Historically earthen dams were sometimes built in {{direct contact with}} the bedrock joints, causing a contact point between the soil of the dam and the flowing water. It has been engineering practice to place grout into exposed bedrock joints for some time now. However, soil is not always cleaned out of bedrock joints before they are grouted, which leaves a weakness for water to push through. The {{purpose of this study is}} to understand the point at which water flowing through bedrock joints will erode soil from the earthen dam embankment. The information of how much soil is eroded away in an amount of time is also crucial to the scope of this study. The goals of this study were accomplished by building a physical model or apparatus of an earthen dam embankment on top of a simulated bedrock joint. Different soil types were tested in the apparatus to start a database of information about erosion rates of the soil along the bedrock joint and embankment interface. These results will be used to start a database for organizations that assign probabilities of dam failures. The purpose of the study is not to indicate when dams will fail, but to help with assigning probabilities of the likelihood of a serious problem being caused from this type of mechanism presented in this study...|$|R
40|$|The {{abutment}} wall behavior of full height frame integral bridges in loose granule backfill under temperature changes was investigated within this study. Since, {{the effect of}} backfill soil resistance on behavior of {{abutment wall}} movement was mostly neglected in previous researches, the abutment-backfill interaction {{was selected as the}} research study area and therefore, deriving the final abutment displacement profile was set as the research objective. In frame abutment integral bridges, the superstructure is encased <b>into</b> the <b>abutment</b> wall in which produces a fixed connectivity. This connection results in the same movement of abutment top elevation and the bridge superstructure. Furthermore, the abutment is mostly built in reinforced concrete, thus it acts as a rigid mass with a linear deformation behavior. With regard to these points and applying a new method for calculation of bridge deck displacement, the abutment deformation profile was formulated. In the new applied method, the final bridge deck displacement was expressed as a function of backfill soil resistance utilizing some available correlations due to soil behavior, such as British Standard, Massachusetts, Canadian and Husain-Bagnaroil. Fortunately, the results obtained from these correlations were in a close agreement with each other, which confirmed the integrity of applied method. Moreover, a finite element model was built in SAP 2000 for this case and subsequently the outcomes were compared with the results of applied method. It was seen that both results were consistent and in most of the cases, the British Standard concluded the closets results to the finite element as compared with the others...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this in vitro study was to analyze the stress {{distribution}} on components of a mandibular-cantilevered implant-supported prosthesis with frameworks cast in cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) or palladium-silver (Pd-Ag) alloys, according to the cantilever length. Frameworks were fabricated on (Co-Cr) and (Pd-Ag) alloys and screwed <b>into</b> standard <b>abutments</b> positioned on a master-cast containing five implant replicas. Two linear strain gauges were fixed on the mesial and distal aspects of each abutment to capture deformation. A vertical static load of 100 N {{was applied to the}} cantilever arm at the distances of 10, 15, and 20 mm {{from the center of the}} distal abutment and the absolute values of specific deformation were recorded. Different patterns of abutment deformation were observed according to the framework alloy. The Co-Cr alloy framework resulted in higher levels of abutment deformation than the silver-palladium alloy framework. Abutment deformation was higher with longer cantilever extensions. Physical properties of the alloys used for framework interfere with abutment deformations patterns. Excessively long cantilever extensions must be avoided.

30|$|In {{case of the}} {{implementation}} at UGM, an insufficient consolidation of the concrete lead to a remaining leakage at the contact surface between concrete and steel connector. This failure is usually related to poor equipment and/or insufficient accuracy regarding the construction process. Commonly, this problem is resolved through an injection campaign (Fig.  7) which is an adequate standard procedure applicable through local personnel. Hereby, epoxy resin is pressed <b>into</b> the concrete <b>abutment</b> through boreholes, which had been drilled on the connector’s circumference. To get the optimum result, the correct orientation of the boreholes needs to be assured to meet the problematic area as close as possible. Applying this procedure, the desired tightness was achieved. Based on this experience, the preparation of such injections as potential after-treatment is reasonable. Here, the required rubber hoses can be installed prior to the concreting process; therefore, the contact area between concrete and steel connector can be met directly. If the desired tightness is achieved immediately, experience proofed that the hoses shall remain opened with regard to a potential later utilization.|$|R
