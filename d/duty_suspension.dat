25|$|Jeep {{advertising}} {{has always}} emphasized the vehicle's off-road capabilities. Today, the Wrangler {{is one of}} the few remaining four-wheel-drive vehicles with solid front and rear axles. These axles are known for their durability, strength, and articulation. New Wranglers come with a Dana 44 rear differential and a Dana 30 front differential. The upgraded Rubicon model of the JK Wrangler is equipped with electronically activated locking differentials, Dana 44 axles front and rear with 4.10 gears, a 4:1 transfer case, electronic sway bar disconnect and heavy <b>duty</b> <b>suspension.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1994 the Caprice {{received}} new engines, {{including an}} optional detuned {{version of the}} Corvette's LT1 350cuin (5.7L) engine that put out 260hp (194kW) and 330lb·ft (447N·m) of torque. The standard engine in all sedans, including the 9C1 police cars, was the , L99 263 (4.3L) V8. TheLT1 was optional in the 9C1 police package and standard in the wagon. The LT1350 was standard in the civilian sedans {{with the addition of}} the B4U towing package. The towing package also gave a heavy <b>duty</b> <b>suspension</b> nearly identical to the 9C1 police car suspension, 2.93 gears, heavy duty cooling, heavy duty rear drum brakes and limited-slip differential. The 1994 Caprice's interior had a redesign which featured a Camaro steering wheel, digital speedometer and a new console.|$|E
2500|$|Pit {{bikes are}} {{frequently}} heavily customized with decorative add-ons and performance-enhancing parts. Many riders and mechanics bore-out or replace engines {{in order to}} increase displacement and therefore power output. [...] Heavy <b>duty</b> <b>suspension</b> systems, are often a necessary addition, since the stock mini-bike suspension was designed for a small child. Wheel, brake, and tire upgrades are sometimes performed to improve handling.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two basic}} {{versions}} of the T-98 Kombat based on General Motors components, including an 8.1 litre Vortec engine, Allison transmission, and GM heavy <b>duty</b> <b>suspensions.</b> They are: ...|$|R

50|$|The FE line is {{available}} in two frame heights for general transport distribution duty or one light construction transport <b>duty.</b> The <b>suspension</b> {{is available}} either on full air or combination of front parabolic leaf spring and rear air bags or rear S parabolic springs.Wide selection of rear axle ratios in both single and hub reduction are on offer with differential locks as standard in 4x2,6x2 and 6x4 configuration.|$|R
2500|$|The XC also {{introduced}} the country's first locally produced family sedans with a suspension designed around radial-ply tyres. Known as [...] "Touring Suspension" [...] (or 'Sports Handling Suspension'), it initially was standard on the Fairmont GXL sedan (optional on other sedans) {{until it was}} made standard equipment on all sedans and hardtops in the 1978 'XC½' facelift. For better handling on station wagons, owners could order the stiffer heavy <b>duty</b> <b>suspension</b> package as a no-cost option.|$|E
2500|$|Modifications {{a police}} car might undergo include {{adjustments}} for higher durability, speed, high-mileage driving, and long periods of idling at a higher temperature. [...] This is usually accomplished by heavy <b>duty</b> <b>suspension,</b> brakes, calibrated speedometer, tires, alternator, transmission, and cooling systems, and also sometimes includes slight modifications to the car's stock engine or the installation of a more powerful engine than would be standard in that model. [...] It is also usual to upgrade {{the capacity of the}} electrical system of the car to accommodate the use of additional electronic equipment.|$|E
2500|$|Optional {{equipment}} on all passenger cars (except wagons) included metallic brake linings {{and a heavy}} <b>duty</b> <b>suspension</b> consisting of a front anti-roll bar, rear axle limit straps, revised spring rates and recalibrated shock absorbers. These provided a major handling improvement by reducing the potentially violent camber change of the rear wheels when making sharp turns at high speeds. [...] The Turbocharged Spyder equipment group featured a multi-gauge instrument cluster which included a tachometer, cylinder head temperature and intake manifold pressure gauges, Spyder fender script and Turbo logo deck emblems {{in addition to the}} high performance engine.|$|E
50|$|Although {{conceived}} for {{the home}} market, export versions were soon introduced, these were the OPSUC1, with heavier <b>duty</b> tyres and <b>suspension,</b> and the LOPSUC1, which also had left hand drive, suffixes and options as for home market models.|$|R
50|$|On 12 February 2016, Commissioner of Finance, Fred Kpakol {{along with}} Accountant General Abere Dagogo were {{temporarily}} relieved of their <b>duties.</b> The <b>suspension</b> lasted until 15 February before being lifted following interventions by different political leaders. Governor Ezenwo Nyesom Wike also suspended Kelvin Wachukwu indefinitely {{from his post}} as Commissioner of Works. The reasons given included negligence, dereliction of duty and poor project supervision. Wachukwu was replaced by Bathuel Harrison Iheanyichukwu, who was officially sworn into the Cabinet on 9 May.|$|R
50|$|BMW's {{patented}} telelever front suspension {{appears at}} first glance to be conventional telescopic fork, but the fork tubes contain neither springs nor damping. Instead, a wishbone and an inboard monoshock perform <b>suspension</b> <b>duties,</b> and the forks serve to locate the front wheel and control steering.|$|R
2500|$|A unique dealer-installed option also VAM's own [...] "Go Pack". This {{consisted}} of manual front disk brakes, heavy <b>duty</b> <b>suspension</b> with front sway bar plus rear torsion and traction bars, aluminum four-barrel intake manifold with four-barrel Carter carburetor, headers with equal-length tubes and dual final outlets, dual exhausts, ported head with larger valves and heavy duty springs, 302 degree camshaft, Hurst linkage for the manual transmission, [...] "Rallye Pak" [...] auxiliary gauges on dashboard (different from AMC's original units), exclusive steering wheel, exclusive dual remote mirrors, and exclusive turbine wheels. The performance upgrades of the Go Pack represented a 40% increase of engine output making the VAM Javelin far more competitive against its V8 rivals from Ford de México, General Motors de México, and Automex (Chrysler de México).|$|E
2500|$|For 1964 {{significant}} engineering changes occurred, {{while the}} model lineup and styling remained relatively unchanged. The engine displacement was increased from [...] {{by an increase}} in stroke. The base engine power increased from , and the high performance engine increased from [...] The Spyder engine rating remained at [...] despite the displacement increase of the engine. 1964 saw an improvement in the car's swing axle rear suspension {{with the addition of a}} transverse leaf spring along with softer rear coil springs designed to diminish rear roll stiffness and foster more neutral handling. Spring rates could now be softer at both ends of the car compared to previous models. The heavy <b>duty</b> <b>suspension</b> was no longer optional, although all models now had a front anti-roll bar as standard. Brakes were improved with finned rear drums. The remaining pickup, the Rampside, was discontinued at the end of the model year.|$|E
2500|$|Also new for 1977 was VAM's first {{station wagon}} {{that was not}} an economy base model, the first in 17 years. This model was not a new trim level but a package {{included}} with {{the order of the}} automatic transmission. Like the American GFS, the engine changed from the 258 six to the 282 cu in unit and the 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio. Like the American ECD, it shared the column-mounted gearshift and high-trim-upholstered bench seats (fold down rear unit) and special side panels. Accessories shared with both luxury sedans included power brakes, power steering, heavy <b>duty</b> <b>suspension,</b> bumper guards, full bright molding package, luxury wheel covers, [...] "4.6" [...] emblems (GFS only), tinted windshield, luxury steering wheel, electric analog clock, parcel shelf, full light group (except reading dome light) as well as all the general line novelties of the year. This created a luxury wagon {{for the first time in}} VAM's line up. The downside was that the economy base wagon would no longer be available with the option of an automatic transmission. VAM wagons with this package did not obtain a specific name since it was not a trim level, it was known within VAM and in printed materials as [...] "Camioneta Automática" [...] (automatic wagon). It would be until 1979 that it would officially obtain a designation, now based on the Concord-wagon, making [...] "American DL" [...] its full name.|$|E
50|$|To {{combat the}} extra payload and towing {{capacity}} of the diesel, an improved braking package, as well as super heavy <b>duty</b> axles and <b>suspension</b> were fitted. Holden recommends a maximum 3400 kg towing limit for the turbo diesels, with a reduced figure of 2720 kg for the petrol models.|$|R
50|$|After {{his release}} from Wigan in 2010, Riddell made his return to NRL for the 2011 season, {{this time with the}} Sydney Roosters. Riddell was poised to sign with the Wests Tigers, however Tigers coach Tim Sheens made it clear that Riddell was {{unlikely}} to get much game time with the first grade side, barring injury, rep <b>duties</b> or <b>suspension</b> of star hooker Robbie Farah. Linking to the Roosters ensured Riddell would reunite with Brian Smith, whom he played under at the Eels for one and a half seasons.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} tubing, with its wing covered in Dacron sailcloth. Its 10.3 m span wing {{is supported by a}} single tube-type kingpost and uses an [...] "A" [...] frame control bar. Unlike the Aeros-2 the Cross Country does not have a cockpit fairing and sports heavy <b>duty</b> main wheel <b>suspension</b> for rough fields.|$|R
2500|$|Don Yenko, who {{had been}} racing Corvettes, could not compete {{successfully}} against the Carroll Shelby Mustangs after they arrived on the scene; he therefore decided to race modified Corvairs, beginning with the 1966 model. As the stock Corvair did not fit {{into any of the}} SCCA categories, Yenko had to modify four-carburetor Corsas into [...] "sports cars" [...] by removing the back seat; in the process he introduced various performance improvements. As the SCCA required 100 cars to be manufactured to homologate the model for production racing, Yenko completed 100 Stingers in one month in 1965. Although all were white, as the SCCA required for American cars at the time, [...] {{there was a great deal}} of variety between individual cars; some had exterior modifications including fiberglass engine covers with spoilers, some did not; some received engine upgrades developing 160, 190, 220, or 240hp (119, 142, 164, or 179kW). All were equipped by the Chevrolet factory with heavy <b>duty</b> <b>suspension,</b> four speed transmission, quicker steering ratio, [...] "positraction" [...] limited-slip differentials (50 with 3.89 gears, and 50 with 3.55 when Chevrolet dropped the 3.89) and dual brake master cylinders (the first application of this by Chevrolet, to become stock equipment the next year). Because most of the engine cooling in air-cooled engines is done by circulating oil, an oil cooler was necessary for competition use, this was mounted externally on the rear body section above the left wheel.|$|E
2500|$|The 1975 American ECD came {{standard}} with a 170 gross hp [...] inline six engine with a single-barrel Carter carburetor, electronic ignition, 266 degree camshaft, and 7.6:1 {{compression ratio}} with regular cooling system. Included were manual front disk brakes with rear drums, power steering, heavy <b>duty</b> <b>suspension</b> with front sway bar, Chrysler TorqueFlite A904 three-speed automatic transmission, and 3.31:1 rear gear ratio. The {{exterior of the}} model incorporated a full vinyl roof with bright moldings, regular bright molding package (wheel lip, rocker panels, drip rails, and between taillights molding), luxury wheel covers, [...] "American" [...] and [...] "Automático" [...] emblems on the rear panel, [...] "258" [...] emblems on rear quarter panels, and golden [...] "ECD" [...] emblems over {{the base of the}} C-pillars. Standard equipment also consisted of front and rear bench seats, front two-point seatbelts, front and rear armrests, luxury upholstery, custom steering wheel, column-mounted shifter, color-keyed padded dashboard, gasoline and water temperature gauges, warning lights (brakes, oil and electrical system), 200km/h speedometer, vacuum gauge, front ashtray, cigarette lighter, heater with front defroster, AM monoaural radio with a single speaker and antenna, locking glove box, parcel sheft, courtesy lights, padded sun visors, day/night rearview mirror, heat and sound insulating cardboard-type headliner, round dome light, dual coat hooks, rear ashtray mounted on the front seat back and driver's side remote mirror. Optional equipment included among others a passenger's side mirror, remote-controlled driver's side mirror, power brakes, bumper guards, tinted windshield, and light group.|$|E
2500|$|The 1972 Charger {{introduced}} a new [...] "Rallye" [...] option to replace the R/T version. The SE was differentiated from other 1972 Chargers by a unique formal roof treatment and hidden headlights. The 383 engine was replaced with a lower compression 4-barrel 400, while the 440 engine was still available, with lowered compression and downrated to net [...] instead of the previous [...] gross. The ratings went down as the net horsepower measure was more realistic. Also beginning in 1972, all engines featured hardened valve seats to {{permit the use of}} regular leaded or unleaded gasoline rather than leaded premium fuel as in past years due to tighter emissions regulations. Though the 440+6 (designating a triple 2-barrel carb setup and [...] was listed in the early 1972 sales literature, it was found in the August 1971 testing that this engine would not meet the new and more stringent 1972 emissions laws, although some early Dodge literature (August 1971 press) stated that this engine was available for 1972, and a few (six is the accepted number) factory installed six-pack Chargers were built, the engine was dropped out of production by September 1971. [...] The optional Pistol-Grip 4-speed Hurst manual shifter could be coupled to the 340, 400, and 440 Magnum engines. The Ramcharger hood scoop was discontinued, as well as optional lower geared performance rear axle ratios and extra heavy duty suspensions. It was also the final year for the Dana 60 differential, and was available only in combination with the 440/4 speed, heavy <b>duty</b> <b>suspension,</b> and the 3.54:1 rear axle ratio.|$|E
50|$|Companies use ERP {{software}} to calculate duties automatically to, on one hand, avoid error-prone manual work on duty regulations and formulas {{and on the}} other hand, manage and analyze the historically paid duties. Moreover, ERP software offers an option for customs warehouse, introduced to save duty and VAT payments. In addition, the <b>duty</b> deferment and <b>suspension</b> is also taken into consideration.|$|R
40|$|Automotive {{suspension}} is {{an important}} device for transmission and torque. The main parameters and dimensions of 40 tons of heavy <b>duty</b> truck spring <b>suspension</b> system are designed in the paper. According to the data, the 3 D modeling and virtual assembly of the leaf spring suspension are carried out by using parametric design. Structural stress of spring suspension is analyzed which can provide a guide and basis {{for the design of}} the leaf spring suspension...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the design and test a multiple-DOF motion platform for vibration analysis of heavy <b>duty</b> vehicle seat <b>suspension.</b> This motion platform is designed to have 6 -DOF based on the mechanism of the parallel manipulator, which has high force-to-weight ratio, high dexterity and high accuracy of position. This platform can be utilized to accurately simulate vehicle vibration with x, y, z-axis translation and roll, pitch, yaw-axis rotation. The 6 -DOF platform is first designed by the PTC Creo software, and then the 3 D model is imported into SimMechanics to get a dynamics model for motion analysis and controller design. The vibration simulation of model shows the motion platform has a good trajectory tracking ability. After the design and simulation are successfully completed, a practical motion platform with 6 electrical cylinders is built. This motion platform is designed to support 250 kg load and achieve a maximum vibration simulation frequency of 12 Hz. The experiments prove that the motion platform can simulate the translation and rotation vibration with required frequency range and amplitude. This 6 -DOF motion platform can be applied in the multi-DOF vibration analysis for heavy <b>duty</b> vehicle seat <b>suspension...</b>|$|R
2500|$|The biggest {{news was}} the {{addition}} of a high-performance version of the two-door sedan called American 06/S. This model was characterized by the factory-modified [...] engine. Developed by VAM's engineering department, its net output was [...] at 4200 rpm and net torque was rated at [...] at 2600 rpm. The special model came standard with power brakes with front disks, power steering, front sway bar, heavy <b>duty</b> <b>suspension</b> (stiffer springs and shocks), TREMEC 170-F four-speed manual transmission with Hurst linkage, 3.31:1 rear differential gear ratio, heavy duty cooling (coolant recovery tank, fan shroud, seven-bladed flexible fan and three-line radiator), leather-wrapped three-arm sports steering wheel, reclining high-back bucket seats, dynamic three-point seat belts, center console with armrest and Rallye gauges (clock, vacuumeter, ammeter and oil pressure), digital tachometer, woodgrain panels on dashboard, parcel shelf, light group (except dome), AM radio with a passenger side rear quarter panel-mounted antenna, dual remote-controlled mirrors, high trim upholstery with map pouches and carpet inserts on the door panels, tinted windshield, blacked-out bumpers, VAM-designed sports steel grille, sports steel 14×6 wheels with blacked out volcano hubcaps, and D70×14 radial tires. The [...] "Hornet in Flames" [...] decal design used by AMC for the 1977 and 1978 AMXs was used in the 06/S over both the hood and trunk lid alongside large white [...] "06 / S" [...] decals over each quarter panel. Optional on this vehicle was a sunroof, rear defroster, reading dome light and AM FM radio. Only 499 units were produced, making it the most collectible Concord-based model for Mexico and practically the local equivalent of the 1971 Hornet SC/360 model. It was replaced with the Spirit coupe-based Rally GT model starting in 1980.|$|E
50|$|From 1982 through 1985, Cadillac {{offered an}} 'Eldorado Touring Coupe', with heavier <b>duty</b> <b>suspension,</b> alloy wheels, blackwall tires, minimal {{exterior}} ornamentation and limited paint colors. These were marketed as 'driver's cars' and included bucket seats and a center console.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} types of Corolla Sport RWD for the US market: DX, SR5, and GT-S, though the DX was {{generally}} an internal Toyota designation, as brochures, and advertising {{do not include the}} DX designation; it consisted of a lower trim level, lighter <b>duty</b> <b>suspension</b> parts and the like.|$|E
5000|$|With a new grille {{and single}} {{headlights}} (very {{similar to the}} 1970 model) and four circular taillights for 1972, the Barracuda would remain basically unchanged through 1974, with new body side stripes, and {{minor changes to the}} bumpers to conform with federal impact standards being the only significant variations. Big block engines (383, 440, & 426 Hemi), heavy <b>duty</b> <b>suspensions</b> and rear axles, and large/wide tires mounted on 15" [...] x 7" [...] wheels were no longer offered. Additionally; the convertible model was dropped; though a few late build 1971 convertibles were built with 1972 grills and back end panels and provided to Paramount Studios for TV and movie work; being seen on Mannix, The Brady Bunch and other shows. Convenience and comfort items such as power seats, power windows, and upgraded interior (leather seats and plush carpeting) options were dropped, though heavy-duty air conditioning and a sun roof could still be ordered. For 1972 only, three engine choices were offered: a 225 six, the 318 (base engine for both 'Cuda and Barracuda), and a revised 340 detuned to meet emission standards. In addition, all three were tuned to run on low/no-lead gas and were power rated on the NET (installed) method. Three transmissions were offered: a 3-speed manual, the Torqueflite automatic, and the Hurst shifter equipped four-speed. For 1973 federally mandated safety bumpers were added front and rear, and the 225 six was dropped, with the 318 and 340 V8s being the only engine choices. For late production 1973 cars, and for 1974 a slightly more powerful 360 V8 (245 E bodyhp) replaced the 340. As since 1970; optional was a four-speed manual transmission (equipped with a Hurst shifter) mated to a performance ratio (3.55 to 1) rear axle for the 340 and 360 engines, though as many as three cars (in each of 1973 and 1974) were built with the 318 engine and Hurst 4-speed thru special orders or factory errors.|$|R
5000|$|The TSi {{could only}} be ordered in select colors, which {{included}} Black, Platinum, and Deep Amethyst. TSi packages came equipped with 5 spoke 16 in alloy wheels (similar in style to those available on the 1996 [...] "Chrysler Sebring Coupe"), 225/70R16 Goodyear Eagle GA tires, fog lights, Luxury group, featuring: [...] "Highland" [...] perforated, power, leather seats, overhead computer, and a premium sound system with steering wheel mounted controls. Contrary to popular belief, the suspension used on the TSi was the standard <b>duty</b> Quadra-Coil <b>suspension</b> used on all non-UpCountry ZJs. Both the 4.0 I6 and the 5.2 V8 were available. Quadra-Trac was standard with the TSi package for both engines, while Selec-Trac was optional with the I6. Both engine options could also be special ordered in 2 wheel drive configurations. The TSi was priced between the Laredo and the Limited; however, it was comparatively unpopular and a limited number were sold.|$|R
50|$|Showtime was {{suspended}} by the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB) for twenty days. This {{was due to}} comments uttered by guest judge Rosanna Roces against certain groups, especially teachers, heard live on January 7, 2010. As a form of self-regulation, ABS-CBN relieved Roces of her jury <b>duty,</b> but a <b>suspension</b> was still served against the show effective January 11, 2010. It returned on February 1. In the meantime, a placeholder show called Magpasikat took over Showtimes timeslot.

50|$|In 2011, due to Gregg Rosen being {{diagnosed}} with cancer, the team was sold to a group that included Colin Birkas, the {{head coach of the}} Greater Kingston Jr. Frontenacs. Evan Robinson was relieved of his head coaching duties and Birkas replaced him. As well, the general manager duties were assumed by Denis Duchesne. During the summer of 2014, Duchesne was relieved of his duties as general manager and the role was filled on an interim basis by Birkas and Rick Poirier. Poirier retired from the team shortly before Christmas 2014. Toward the end of the 2014-15 season, Birkas was suspended for an infraction during a game against the Wellington Dukes, causing assistants Ben Munroe and Dan Clarke to assume the coaching <b>duties.</b> Birkas' <b>suspension</b> was for the balance of the 2014-15 season, the playoffs, and the entire 2015-16 season. Despite this, the Voyageurs rallied and managed to have a magical 2015 playoff run. This was highlighted by a comeback from being down 0-3 against the Aurora Tigers to win in seven games, as well as taking the defending champion Toronto Lakeshore Patriots to Game 7 in the Buckland Cup finals.|$|R
2500|$|A {{new body}} was {{introduced}} for the 1956 model featuring a new [...] "face" [...] and side coves; the taillamp fins were also gone. An optional {{fuel injection system}} was made available {{in the middle of}} the 1957 model year. It was one of the first mass-produced engines in history to reach [...] per cubic inch (16.4 cubic cm) and Chevrolet's advertising agency used a [...] "one hp per cubic inch" [...] slogan for advertising the [...] Small-Block engine. Other options included power windows (1956), hydraulically operated power convertible top (1956), heavy <b>duty</b> brakes and <b>suspension</b> (1957), and four speed manual transmission (late 1957).
