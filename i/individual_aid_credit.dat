5000|$|Officially {{supported}} {{export credit}} may {{be connected to}} official development assistance (ODA) in two ways. First, they may be mixed with ODA, while still financing the same project (mixed credit). As the export credit is tied to purchases in the issuing country, the whole package qualifies as a tied <b>aid</b> <b>credit,</b> even if the ODA part is untied aid. Second, tied <b>aid</b> <b>credits</b> are not very different from export credits, except in interest, grace period (the time {{when there is no}} repayment of the principal) and terms of repayment. Such credits are separated from export credit by an OECD requirement that they have a minimum degree of [...] "softness". [...] "Softness" [...] is measured by a formula that compares the present value of the credit with the present value of the same amount at standardized [...] "commercial" [...] terms. This difference is expressed {{as a percentage of the}} credit and called [...] "concessionality level". Thus a grant has a concessionality level of 100%, a commercial credit scores zero per cent. The higher the concessionality level, the more the tied <b>aid</b> <b>credit</b> looks like ODA, the lower, the more it looks like an export credit.|$|R

40|$|In my diploma thesis, I {{focused on}} pupils with {{mathematics}} learning difficulties {{as well as}} on the individual approaches concerning various types of learning aid. The research was carried out in order to investigate the effects of <b>individual</b> learning <b>aid</b> on pupils with regard to the opinions held by the pupils in question, their parents, and the involved teachers. I was interested in finding out how, from the standpoint of the pupils in question as well as that of their parents and teachers, the <b>individual</b> learning <b>aid</b> affects the pupils’ study habits. I considered several research questions concerning various aspects of <b>individual</b> learning <b>aid.</b> My first research questions was about the effects of learning aid on the learning of mathematics. Another research questions was about the pupils’ study habits. Finally, I questioned whether that the pupils’ motivation for learning mathematics will increase and whether pupils will be motivated to attend learning aid lessons. The stated research questions were studied by means of two different questionnaires; one was filled in by the pupils participating in the learning aid lessons, by their parents and teachers, while a different questionnaire was filled in by the special education teacher. The study sample included seventeen pupils which participated in afternoon <b>individual</b> learning <b>aid</b> lessons in mathematics regularly (i. e. once a week). ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the extent to which {{incontinence}} aids, used in local authority/municipal nursing homes, were adapted to the resident’s urine-leakage volume and to find out how nurses perceived the current situation concerning individual testing of incontinence aids in municipal nursing homes. The study method was a quantitative empirical study and was carried out in two phases. The first phase was a weighing test, carried out in three nursing homes, whereby the incontinence aids used by 25 residents during a 48 hour period were weighed. The second phase was the completion of a questionnaire by the municipal nurses working in the same local authority. The questionnaire covered: the division of responsibilities; routines for testing incontinence aids, and the level of knowledge concerning <b>individual</b> incontinence <b>aid</b> testing. Only 22 % of the pads used during the observation were properly adapted to the patients’ urinary leakage volume, while 76 % of incontinence aids were larger than necessary in relation to the real volume of urinary leakage. The municipal nurses, who have a key role and formal responsibility for <b>individual</b> incontinence <b>aid</b> testing, considered that there was insufficient knowledge within the organisation concerning <b>individual</b> incontinence <b>aid</b> testing, and that the division of responsibilities in this area was unclear. There were great variations relating to the extent of the nurses’ involvement in <b>individual</b> incontinence <b>aid</b> testing, and the nurses stated that increased involvement in <b>individual</b> incontinence <b>aid</b> testing was dependent on more time being made available for this task. Only a minority of the nurses thought that the requisitioning of incontinence aids was preceded by individual testing of the incontinence pads within the organisation. The majority of nurses considered that this was not the case or were unsure of the situation...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} indicates that the political impact of aid, including its impact on accountability institutions, is contingent on its objective. This article explains how this occurs.

40|$|In recent time, Ghana has {{embarked}} on policies that aim to rebalance the role {{of public and private}} sector in the economy and thus emphasize private sector development. This paradigm shift is to encourage private investment and ultimately make private sector the engine of growth.
