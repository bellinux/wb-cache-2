5|$|During the heats, the Australian team of Brooks, Fasala, Delany and Stockwell {{showed their}} {{intention}} to deny the Americans the gold {{for the first time}} at Olympic level. Drawn alongside the Americans in the third and final heat, the Australians set a new Olympic record of 3m 19.94s. Brooks led off in the <b>heat,</b> <b>setting</b> a time of 50.36s, before Stockwell made up a deficit of 0.41s during the anchor leg to beat the hosts by 0.20s. Australia and the United States had stamped their authority on the event, qualifying almost four seconds faster than third-placed Sweden. However, the Americans had more speed in reserve, having rested 200m freestyle silver medalist Mike Heath and 100m freestyle gold medallist Rowdy Gaines, whereas Australia used its full-strength team.|$|E
50|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>setting</b> is a {{term used}} in the textile {{industry}} to describe a thermal process taking place mostly in either a steam atmosphere or a dry heat environment. The effect of the process gives fibers, yarns or fabric dimensional stability and, very often, other desirable attributes like higher volume, wrinkle resistance or temperature resistance. Very often, <b>heat</b> <b>setting</b> {{is also used to}} improve attributes for subsequent processes. Yarns tend to have increased torquing just after spinning, cabling or twisting. <b>Heat</b> <b>setting</b> can influence or even eliminate this tendency to undesirable torquing. At the winding, twisting, weaving, tufting and knitting processes, an increased tendency to torquing can cause difficulties in processing the yarn. When using <b>heat</b> <b>setting</b> for carpet yarns, desirable results include not only the diminishing of torquing but also the stabilization or fixing of the fiber thread. Both twist stabilization and stabilization of frieze effect are results of the <b>heat</b> <b>setting</b> process. <b>Heat</b> <b>setting</b> benefits staple yarns as well as bulked continuous filament (BCF) yarns. <b>Heat</b> <b>setting</b> often causes synthetic fibers to gain volume as well. This volume growth is commonly described as “bulk development”. All processes using temperature and/or moisture to give textiles one of the above-mentioned attributes are known as <b>heat</b> <b>setting.</b> The term “thermal fixation” is used less frequently. In the carpet industry, the process is exclusively called “heat setting”.|$|E
50|$|The {{unprocessed}} yarn {{is provided}} on packages in a creel (up to 72 packages). At {{a speed of}} up to 700 m/min, the yarn is pulled off the packages and entered into the <b>heat</b> <b>setting</b> process. There are two basic ways of transportation of the yarn through the process. One way is to place the yarn in coils or a “figure 8 pattern on a belt or to wrap it onto ropes arranged as a polygon in order to convey it through the process. With Frieze yarns only belt conveying is utilized. Frieze is produced by a special stuffer box, the so-called Twinroll-Box (TRB).The <b>heat</b> <b>setting</b> process takes place at temperatures between 110 °C and 200 °C in a steam-air-mix. After <b>heat</b> <b>setting,</b> the yarn is cooled and wound onto packages again at the winder. In general a <b>heat</b> <b>setting</b> machine consists of six lines at eight ends (fibers) each. A daily production of up to 10.5 tons is possible.|$|E

40|$|The {{main object}} of this thesis was {{the study of}} {{structural}} variations in polyester fibres when <b>heat</b> <b>set,</b> through the determination of its fine structural parameters. The materials employed were fabric samples in grey state and scoured which were further on <b>heat</b> <b>set</b> in an industrial stenter under twelve different industrial conditions of temperature, time and overfeed. Three types of techniques were employed: Exclusion Chromatography, Density Gradient Column, Differential Scanning Calorimetry, Critical Dissolution Time, Contraction Force, Thermomechanical Analysis and Iodine Sorption...|$|R

50|$|Carpet {{styles are}} divided into two basic types. These types are loop pile carpets and cut pile carpets. Especially for {{cut-pile}} and its variations (Saxony, shag, frieze) the <b>heat</b> <b>setting</b> process is of highest importance.|$|E
50|$|Usually, when yarn is cut, {{the ends}} fray {{similar to the}} way the ends of a braid or rope would fray when they are cut and a kind of a brush forms. This fraying must be avoided in {{cut-pile}} carpets by all means. A cut pile carpet with frayed yarn ends would have a poor appearance, a shorter life cycle and ergonomic disadvantages for the “walker” as scientific research has proven. The carpet is less elastic and doesn’t absorb the steps of the user as well as a <b>heat</b> <b>set</b> carpet would. A carpet manufactured from <b>heat</b> <b>set</b> yarn is more attractive, durable and comfortable for the user. The added value of heatset carpet is significant. Normally a <b>heat</b> <b>set</b> carpet can be identified by its grainy structure, which is called “pinpoint tip definition” in the industry. The appearance of the cut pile ends is similar to pin points.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the Power-Heat-Set technology there is the SUPERBA TVP3 process {{which is also a}} continuous process. In the TVP3 process yarn is placed on a conveyor belt and inserted through a lock into a pressure tunnel that could be up to 15 m long. Inside the tunnel, it undergoes a <b>heat</b> <b>setting</b> process with saturated steam. At {{the end of the tunnel}} the yarn is taken out through a second lock. The yarn which is still hot and moist is dried and cooled after <b>heat</b> <b>setting</b> and fed to the winding process. Up to 72 yarn ends can be processed at the same time.|$|E
50|$|The oldest <b>heat</b> <b>setting</b> {{process is}} {{autoclave}} <b>heat</b> <b>setting.</b> Mostly, it is a discontinuous process.Autoclave installations use vacuum and/or pressure. Textile material {{is brought into}} the autoclave either on bobbins, in skeins or loose in a container. As nearly all autoclaves are exposed to certain pressures they are usually built in cylindrical shape and mounted horizontally. Most commonly, autoclaves are loaded and unloaded {{from the end of}} the cylinder but some may be loaded from one end and unloaded from the other end. Autoclaves mounted vertically exist but are less common.They are mostly used for the synthetic yarns like polyester, polyethylene, poly propylene and nylons.|$|E

50|$|C. rex {{requires}} a temperate climate (in winter, artificial <b>heating</b> <b>set</b> at 16 °C {{at night and}} 18 °C during the day is recommended) and good ventilation (a dark and enclosed environment will attract fungi or bacterial diseases).|$|R
40|$|Personal comfort systems provide comfort by {{targeting}} heating or cooling {{to important}} parts of the human body, making tight ambient temperature control less important. This paper provides evidence that comfort is possible under cooler-than-normal ambient temperatures when occupants have personal control over a very local thermal condition—the warmth of their feet. During a six-month winter period in Berkeley California, office workers were given low-energy adjustable footwarmers and the room <b>heating</b> <b>set</b> point was gradually lowered from 21. 1 C (70 F) to 18. 9 C (66 F). Occupant surveys showed statistically equivalent thermal comfort for the original ‘higher heating setpoint no-footwarmer’ condition and the ‘lower <b>heating</b> <b>set</b> point plus occupant-controllable footwarmer’ condition. The overall reduction in heating energy varied between 38 % and 75 % depending on the setpoint reduction and outdoor conditions. The added plug load energy from the low-energy footwarmers was substantially less than the heating energy saved by lowering the <b>heating</b> <b>set</b> point (11 - 21 W vs 500 - 700 W average power per occupant during occupied hours).  A few subjects had ergonomic issues with the particular footwarmers used, so usage was not universal.   Additional designs or options will be needed in future applications...|$|R
50|$|In the Power-Heat-Set process yarn is <b>heat</b> <b>set</b> with {{superheated}} steam {{in an open}} system at atmospheric pressure.

50|$|In 19th century France, gas ovens did not exist. People largely {{used the}} breadmakers' ovens which only had two settings, {{a very strong}} and high <b>heat</b> <b>setting</b> used for {{roasting}} meats and vegetables, or the petit four setting. This setting was of a lower temperature allowing the correct heat to cook pastries.|$|E
50|$|Some silk dyes do {{not require}} <b>heat</b> <b>setting</b> or steaming. They strike instantly, {{allowing}} the designer to dye color upon color. These dyes are intended mostly for silk scarf dyeing. They also dye bamboo, rayon, linen, and some other natural fabrics like hemp and wool to a lesser extent, but do not set on cotton.|$|E
50|$|The {{properties}} of petroleum-based synthetic fibers, most important among them being polyamide, polyester and polyacrylonitrile, are essentially {{different from those}} of natural cellulosic and protein/wool fibers. Hence the sequence of finishing operations is likely to be different. While cellulosic fabrics require a resin finishing treatment to impart easy-care properties, synthetic fibers already exhibit these easy-care criteria and require only a <b>heat</b> <b>setting</b> operation.|$|E

50|$|For {{automation}} in link spinning/winding {{there is}} the so-called “in-line steamer”. The first known process of this type is the Steamatic process by Resch. In this case the <b>heat</b> <b>setting</b> process happens in between the ring spinning and the winding machines. As soon as the ring spinning frame has finished spinning, the loaded bobbins are transported into the in-line steamer. Those bobbins are steamed there with a vacuum method and dried again within seconds. After steaming and drying, the bobbins are transported on to the winding machine where they are re-wound onto a cross-wound package.|$|E
50|$|From a terminological {{point of}} view, geopolymer cement is a binding system that hardens at room temperature, like regular Portland cement.

40|$|An office {{equipped}} with personal footwarmers was maintained at cooler-than-normal indoor {{temperatures in the}} winter, producing great energy savings.   The occupants’ thermal comfort was not affected.   The footwarmers provide individual heating control over {{a segment of the}} body that most strongly influences comfort perception when one is cool overall.   If cooler ambient indoor temperatures could be made comfortable, savings in central heating energy would be possible.   During a six-month winter period in Berkeley California, knowledge workers with low-energy footwarmers experienced a lowering of room <b>heating</b> <b>set</b> point from 21. 1 ºC (70 ºF) to 18. 9 ºC (66 ºF).
