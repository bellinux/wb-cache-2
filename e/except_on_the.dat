5|$|Externally, {{there are}} slate roofs and coped gables with cross finials. The roofs have {{patterned}} bands of fishscale Whitland Abbey slates, <b>except</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nave. There are large scale, plain unbuttressed walls without batter for the nave, a nineteenth century south porch, two transepts and a chancel with a nineteenth century {{addition of a}} north choir vestry; the dating of the priests' vestry, {{on the north side}} of the chancel, is less certain. Externally, the nave downpipes on the south side are dated 1884.|$|E

5|$|In {{some areas}} of the world, {{including}} Berlin, Germany, dropping salt is prohibited altogether <b>except</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> highest-risk roads; plain sand without any melting agents is spread instead. While this may protect the environment, it is more labour-intensive, as more gritting runs are needed; because the sand is insoluble, it tends to accumulate at the sides of the road, making it more difficult for buses to pull in at bus stops.|$|E
5|$|The {{maximum speed}} of {{suburban}} electric multiple units and locomotive hauled trains is 115km/h, with diesel multiple units permitted up to 130km/h {{on the same}} track, and up to 160km/h on specified lines. The maximum axle loading of freight wagons is 20 tonnes, with locomotives of up to 22 tonne axle loading operating. Train lengths are limited to 1200 metres, <b>except</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main interstate lines where 1500 metre long trains are permitted.|$|E
5|$|Following the Constitution of May 3, 1791, the senate's competences were altered; in {{most cases}} the {{senators}} could only vote together with the sejm, and the senate's veto powers were limited. Legislative power was limited to the deputies of the sejm (not senators voting separately, <b>except</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> senate's privilege of veto, a suspension of a given legislation until the sejm votes on it again during the next session). The king, who nominated senators, ministers and other officials, presided over the senate, and could propose new laws together with the executive government, over which he also presided (the newly created Straż Praw or the Guardianship of Laws). The sejm also had the supervisory role, as government ministers and other officials were to be responsible to it.|$|E

5|$|The game {{supports}} {{up to six}} {{human or}} artificial intelligence players in local and online multiplayer, <b>except</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> PlayStation 4, which has a human player limit of four per console. Videoball has team and ranked matchmaking multiplayer modes. There is no set practice game mode, but players can train against computer-controlled opponents in exhibition matches and the scenario-based Arcade mode, in which the player faces two computer-controlled opponents in specific level configurations. The Arcade mode artificial intelligence personalities each have fitting names, such as Homer (who stays near its endzone) and Punchy (who bullies players with projectiles). Some work in pairs to establish gameplay concepts, such as Tippy, who passes the ball to Toppy, who maintains {{the top of the}} field.|$|E
5|$|The gastral {{segments}} {{have small}} constrictions {{between the first}} and second segments. The stinger is long but largely internalized, and it is also stout and slightly upcurved apically. The external parts are enclosed by the gonostyli, and the sting bulb is large. The integument (a protective outer layer) is rugose throughout <b>except</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> legs and gaster. The dorsofrontal area of the head (the back of an insect), and the dorsal surfaces of the gaster, mesosoma and petiole are covered by erect hairs, and slightly longer hairs are present on the ventral regions of the mesosoma and gaster. The apical segments of the gaster have a greater density of setose (bristles) with longer decumbent hairs (meaning that these hairs are lying down).|$|E
5|$|Water {{levels have}} been {{recorded}} since 1875, averaging about 4,200 feet (1,280m) above sea level. Since the Great Salt Lake is a shallow lake with gently sloping shores around all edges <b>except</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> south side, small variations in the water level greatly affect {{the extent of the}} shoreline. The water level can rise dramatically in wet years and fall during dry years. The water level is also affected by the amount of water flow diverted for agricultural and urban uses. The Jordan and Weber rivers, in particular, are diverted for other uses. In the 1880s Grove Karl Gilbert predicted that the lake– then in the middle of many years of recession– would virtually disappear except for a small remnant between the islands.|$|E

5|$|Kuznetsova {{began her}} {{season at the}} Brisbane International. She {{received}} a wild card, but fell {{in the first round}} in the singles to Elena Bovina. In the doubles competition, she paired with Martina Navratilova, with whom she would play throughout the year (<b>except</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Life Open, partnering with Slovak Janette Husárová), and won against Nathalie Dechy and Émilie Loit in straight sets. In the Australian Open, she lost to second seed Venus Williams in the first round. With Navratilova, they lost against ninth seed Daniela Hantuchová and Chanda Rubin in the third round. She paired with Australian Jeff Coetzee but lost to Mark Knowles and Elena Likhovtseva in two tight sets in the first round. In the singles event of the Dubai Tennis Championships in February, Kuznetsova won the first round against 6th seeded Francesca Schiavone, but was beaten by Dinara Safina in the second round. In the doubles event she and Navratilova were beaten by eventual runners-up María Vento-Kabchi and Angelique Widjaja. She did not reach the quarterfinals of any tournament {{during the first half of}} the year. Kuznetsova's win over world No. 11 Anastasia Myskina in the second round of the Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells, California was her highest up to that date.|$|E
5|$|The bird's {{head and}} upper body {{typically}} vary between pale brown and some shade of grey (especially {{on the forehead}} and back) in most subspecies. Some are purer, richer brown instead, and all have fine black-and-white speckles <b>except</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> remiges and rectrices (main wing feathers), which are light brown with darker bands. The heart-shaped face is usually bright white, but in some subspecies it is brown. The underparts, including the tarsometatarsal (lower leg) feathers, vary from white to reddish buff among the subspecies, and are either mostly unpatterned or bear a varying number of tiny blackish-brown speckles. It {{has been found that}} at least in the continental European populations, females with more spotting are healthier than plainer birds. This does not hold true for European males by contrast, where the spotting varies according to subspecies. The beak varies from pale horn to dark buff, corresponding to the general plumage hue, and the iris is blackish brown. The talons, like the beak, vary in colour, ranging from pink to dark pinkish-grey and the talons are black.|$|E
