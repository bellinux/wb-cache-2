40|$|A {{performance}} evaluation of several computers was necessary, so an evaluation program, or benchmark, was run on each computer to determine maximum possible performance. The program {{was used to}} test the Computer Aided Drafting (CAD) ability of each computer by monitoring the speed with which several functions were executed. The main objective of the benchmarking program was to record assembly loading times and <b>image</b> <b>regeneration</b> times and then compile a composite score that could be compared with the same tests on other computers. The three computers that were tested were the Compaq AP 550, the SGI 230, and the Hewlett-PackardP 750 C. The Compaq and SGI computers each had a Pentium III 733 mhz processor, while the Hewlett-Packard had a Pentium III 750 mhz processor. The size and speed of Random Access Memory (RAM) in each computer varied, as did the type of graphics card. Each computer that was tested was using Windows NT 4. 0 and Pro/ENGINEER{trademark} 2000 i CAD benchmark software provided by Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC). The benchmarking program came with its own assembly, automatically loaded and ran tests on the assembly, then compiled the time each test took to complete. Due to the automation of the tests, any sort of user error affecting test scores was virtually eliminated. After all the tests were completed, scores were then compiled and compared. The Silicon Graphics 230 was by far the overall winner with a composite score of 8. 57. The Compaq AP 550 was next with a score of 5. 19, while the Hewlett-Packard P 750 C performed dismally, achieving a score of 3. 34. Several factors, including motherboard chipset, graphics card, and the size and speed of RAM, were involved in the differing scores of the three machines. Surprisingly the Hewlett-Packard, which had the fastest processor, came back with the lowest score. The above factors most likely contributed to the poor performance of the Hewlett-Packard. Based on the results of the benchmark test, the SGI 230 appears to be the best CAD software solution. The Hewlett-Packard most likely performed poorly {{due to the fact that}} it was only running a 100 mhz Front Side Bus (FSB), while the SGI machine was running at a 133 mhz. The Compaq was using a new type of RAM called RDRAM. While this RAM was at first perceived to be a great performer, various benchmarks, including this one, have found that the computers using RDRAM really only achieve average performance...|$|E

This article compares Rachel Rodrigues-Malta’s research on European port cities, carried out in 2004 with funding from IRSIT, and later research on mega-projects in North African cities (FSP Project). Although, in terms of methodology, the research in North Africa {{did not have the}} same objectives and took a wider approach to urban projects that that found by the Villes Interface Portuaire research team, it identified clear convergences with regard to governance and <b>image</b> for <b>regeneration</b> of waterfronts and city/port interfaces. These convergences open up possibilities for a comparative study in the Mediterranean Basin and offer insights into the heuristic opportunities in the research carried out by Rachel Rodrigues- Malta and encourage us to follow in her footsteps...|$|R
40|$|Recent writing around urban {{political}} economy has highlighted {{the difficulty of}} representing multiple responses to local economic development strategies. It {{has been argued that}} it is conceptually important but nonetheless problematic to account for the multiplicity of individual, business, institutional, community, social and other groups' involvement in, interpretation of, or consumption of dominant city <b>images</b> and urban <b>regeneration</b> projects.

40|$|SummaryThe {{structural}} plasticity of neurites in {{the central}} nervous system (CNS) diminishes dramatically after initial development, but the peripheral nervous system (PNS) retains substantial plasticity into adulthood. Nevertheless, functional reinnervation by injured peripheral sensory neurons is often incomplete [1 – 6]. To investigate the developmental control of skin reinnervation, we <b>imaged</b> the <b>regeneration</b> of trigeminal sensory axon terminals in live zebrafish larvae following laser axotomy. When axons were injured during early stages of outgrowth, regenerating and uninjured axons grew into denervated skin and competed with one another for territory. At later stages, after the establishment of peripheral arbor territories, the ability of uninjured neighbors to sprout diminished severely, and although injured axons reinitiated growth, they were repelled by denervated skin. Regenerating axons were repelled specifically by their former territories, suggesting that local inhibitory factors persist in these regions. Antagonizing the function of several members of the Nogo receptor (NgR) /RhoA pathway improved the capacity of injured axons to grow into denervated skin. Thus, as in the CNS, impediments to reinnervation in the PNS arise after initial establishment of axon arbor structure...|$|R
5000|$|From the {{inception}} of faience in the archaeological record of Ancient Egypt, the elected colors of the glazes varied within an array of blue-green hues. Glazed in these colours, faience was perceived as substitute for blue-green materials such as turquoise, found in the Sinai peninsula, and lapis lazuli, from Afghanistan. According to the archaeologist David Frederick Grose, the quest to imitate precious stones [...] "explains why most all early glasses are opaque and brilliantly colored" [...] and that the deepest blue color imitating lapis lazuli was likely the most sought-after. As early as the Predynastic graves at Naqada, Badar, el-Amrah, Matmar, Harageh, Avadiyedh and El-Gerzeh, glazed steatite and faience beads are found associated with these semi-precious stones. The association of faience with turquoise and lapis lazuli becomes even more conspicuous in Quennou's funerary papyrus, giving his title {{as the director of}} overseer of faience-making, using the word which strictly means lapis lazuli, which by the New Kingdom had also come to refer to the 'substitute', faience. The symbolism embedded in blue glazing could recall both the Nile, the waters of heaven and the home of the gods, whereas green could possibly evoke <b>images</b> of <b>regeneration,</b> rebirth and vegetation.|$|R
40|$|Within this article, I {{focus on}} a number of {{productive}} scholarly avenues to which sociological analysis of London 2012 might want to attend. Understanding major sporting events - and thus the Olympic Games - as inextricably entangled with the media-industrial complex, I suggest London 2012 as a commodity spectacle that will emphasize gleaming aesthetics, a (sporting) city and nation collapsed into (simple) tourist images, and the presentation of a particular expression of self within the logics of the global market. In so doing, and by peeking behind the seductive, corporate-inspired veil of material and symbolic <b>regeneration,</b> <b>image,</b> strategy and legacy, we, as a field, can ask crucial questions about whose histories, whose representations and which peoples matter to, and for, the sporting spectacle...|$|R
5000|$|Ethical concerns, {{as well as}} the cost, {{maintenance}} and relative inefficiency of animal research has encouraged development of alternative methods for the study of disease.

Human, inducible pluripotent stem cells can also elucidate new mechanisms for understanding cancer and cell <b>regeneration.</b> <b>Imaging</b> studies (such as MRI or PET scans) enable non-invasive study of human subjects.

40|$|Sustainable forest {{management}} depends on successful forest regeneration. The use of remotely sensed aerial images or digitized aerial photographs of high spatial resolution {{could lead to}} accurate and timely semi-automatic computerized assessments. Techniques based on individual tree crown detection or delineation can produce information about regenerating areas such as stem density, proper tree spacing and stocking, and even possibly, tree species and health estimations. Various computerized tree crown detection and delineation techniques already exist. Some are geared towards dense stands, while others are aimed at open areas. An hybrid detection technique is able to detect the situation at hand and switch paradigm accordingly. Delineation techniques require higher spatial resolution and/or tree sizes, but offer more promises for tree species recognition and health estimation. Most techniques can benefit from particular acquisition conditions (e. g., autumn acquisition) and simple pre-processing techniques to increase their detection or delineation capability and accuracy. This article describes two techniques presently {{under investigation by the}} authors: one of crown detection only, and another capable of crown delineation. Their strengths and weaknesses are illustrated and discussed, as are their pre-processing needs and image acquisition criteria. Various pre-processing techniques are explored. Preliminary results with aerial <b>images</b> of <b>regeneration</b> stands of various ages and densities demonstrate more quantitatively these strengths and weaknesses relative to measurements made on the ground and from aerial photographs...|$|R

Here we report a high-throughput technology for screening Caenorhabditis elegans at cellular resolution over its entire lifespan inside standard multiwell plates using repeated immobilization, imaging and optical manipulation. our {{system does not}} use any fluidic or mechanical components, and can operate {{for tens of thousands}} of cycles without failure.

50|$|The Game of Contemporaneity or dojidai gemu (同時代ゲーム) is a 1979 {{novel by}} the Japanese writer Kenzaburō Ōe. The Game of Contemporaneity was {{originally}} inspired on Diego Rivera’s mural 'Dream on a Sunday Afternoon in the Central Alameda'. Oe's approach {{to history and}} story-telling, like in the mural, exposes the themes of simultaneity, ambiguity and thus complexity. The story centres itself around the alternative world of the dissident samurai, as opposed {{to that of the}} Emperor. The samurai turn into demons after being chased into the forest. The story of the village serves as a microcosmic representation {{of the history of the}} nation as a whole. It has its own creation myth and fertility goddess, as well as having a composite healer/trickster called: The One Who Destroys. Although the novel exposes the themes of marginalisation and outsiderhood, it also provides hope for a new beginning. This emphasizes the central theme of the novel: simultaneous ambiguity, in the amalgamation of past and present, fact and dream, as well as history and myth. Oe uses satire, parody and black humour to describe the many deeds and events of the samurai. This culminates in the Fifty-Day War, in which the samurai and the imperial army battle one another, with The One Who Destroys leading the battle against The No-Name Captain of the imperial guard. It ends in the samurai surrendering to avoid the destruction of the forest (mori). The word 'mori' in itself is ambivalent in that in Japanese it conjures an <b>image</b> of <b>regeneration</b> or rebirth and in Latin that of death.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The pulsatile motion {{artifacts}} in the radial spin-echo diffusion-weighted-imaging (rSE-DWI) are analyzed and {{a method to}} improve the image quality of the rSE-DWI using the projection data regeneration method is proposed in this work. In general, ECG-triggering is used together with the rSE-DWI {{in order to prevent}} the loss of projection data, where the amount of loss depends on the data acquisition timing in the cardiac cycle. The ECG-triggering reduces the artifacts related to the cardiac pulse to some extent, but still leaves some degraded projection data while increasing the data acquisition time. Thus, the projection data regeneration method is pro-posed in order to improve the image quality. In the proposed method, the projection data is acquired by the rSE-DWI from which a temporary image is generated by an inverse Radon transform (IRT). The projection data acquired at each view angle is tested to figure out whether it is damaged by the pulsa-tile motion, and then the degraded data are replaced with the data that are regenerated by the Radon transform (RT) of the temporary <b>image.</b> The <b>regeneration</b> process is repeated until the image gains reasonable quality. In the meanwhile, the thermal noise of the signal is removed using the mask gener-ated by thresholding the intensity of the projection data. In order to demonstrate the efficiency, the proposed method for the improvement of image quality is applied to a phantom and in-vivo images. The quality of the DW images acquired by either ECG-triggered or non-triggered rSE-DWI can be im-proved using the proposed method without increasing the imaging time. Keywords—radial spin-echo diffusion-weighted images (rSE-DWI), ECG-triggering, Projection data regeneration. I...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative optical {{measurements}} at the micron scale {{have been}} {{crucial to the}} study of multiple biological processes, including bacterial chemotaxis, eukaryotic gene expression and y development. Extending measurements to long time scales allows complete observation of processes that are otherwise studied piecemeal, such as development and evolution. This thesis describes the development of two types of microscope for making long term, quantitative measurements, and the tools for image analysis. The rst device is a digital holographic microscope for measuring microbial population dynamics. It allows three dimensional localization of hundreds of cells within a mm 3 sized volume, at micron resolution and an acquisition period of minutes. The technique is simple and inexpensive, which enabled us to construct ten replicate devices for parallel measurements. Each device incorporates precise and programmable control of light and temperature for the microbial ecosystem. Experiments were performed with the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the ciliate Tetrahymena reinhardtii, both together and in isolation, and continued for as long as 90 days. The population dynamics exhibited a striking degree of repeatability, despite the presence of added noise in the illumination, spatial gradients of cell density, convection currents and phenotypic changes of both species. The second device is a thin light sheet fluorescence microscope for tracking nuclei in growing roots of the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The device incorporates a chamber designed to maintain optical quality while providing conditions for root growth. Optical feedback to a translation stage is used to maintain the root tip in the fi eld of view as the root grows by centimeters over several days. Data from a three day experiment is presented to demonstrate the technique. Over 1, 000 nuclei were tracked simultaneously, and hundreds of cell divisions were automatically identif ed. The device was also used to <b>image</b> the <b>regeneration</b> of a root tip after surgical excision. The data corroborate earlier investigations at a more detailed level than was previously possible...|$|R
40|$|Neurodegenerative {{diseases}}, such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s disease,affect up to 40 {{million people}} worldwide. These diseases in humans work by slowly degradingneural structures, but some species, such as planarians, can combat such afflictions by theirrobust regenerative properties. While {{it is known}} that the progressive loss of neural structures arecommon in these diseases, it is not known whether regeneration of neural structures can restorethe brain as it was. Our objective is to inhibit nou-darake (ndk), a gene associated withectopic brain formation, in genetically modified Schmidtea mediterranea planarians andanalyze both partial and full neural regeneration. Our general strategy starts by thedevelopment of three different planarian models utilizing RNA interference (RNAi) : (1) SmedTOR(RNAi) planarians which exhibit only wound-healing abilities similar to humans, (2) Smedapc(RNAi) planarians which have disrupted anterior-posterior (A-P) polarity regenerating onlyposterior ends after amputation, and (3) Smed-βcatenin-B(RNAi) planarians which have disruptedA-P polarity regenerating only anterior ends after amputation. Afterwards, each planarian modelwill be given Smed-ndk(RNAi) and observed intact and after amputation. The proposed study willnot only present detailed spatiotemporal <b>images</b> of neural <b>regeneration</b> in multiple planarianmodels, but propose the planarian as a model organism for future neurodegenerative research.  Our goal is to further the understanding of both partial and full neural regeneration in order tobring forth new treatments for neurodegenerative diseases...|$|R
40|$|Damage to {{peripheral}} nerves often {{cannot be}} repaired by the juxtaposition of the severed nerve ends. Surgeons have typically used autologous nerve grafts, which have several drawbacks including the need for multiple surgical procedures and loss of function at the donor site. As an alternative, the use of nerve guidance channels {{to bridge the gap}} between severed nerve ends is being explored. In this paper, the electrically conductive polymer—oxidized polypyrrole (PP) —has been evaluated for use as a substrate to enhance nerve cell interactions in culture as a first step toward potentially using such polymers to stimulate in vivo nerve <b>regeneration.</b> <b>Image</b> analysis demonstrates that PC- 12 cells and primary chicken sciatic nerve explants attached and extended neurites equally well on both PP films and tissue culture polystyrene in the absence of electrical stimulation. In contrast, PC- 12 cells interacted poorly with indium tin oxide (ITO), poly(l-lactic acid) (PLA), and poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) surfaces. However, PC- 12 cells cultured on PP films and subjected to an electrical stimulus through the film showed a significant increase in neurite lengths compared with ones that were not subjected to electrical stimulation through the film and tissue culture polystyrene controls. The median neurite length for PC- 12 cells grown on PP and subjected to an electrical stimulus was 18. 14 μm (n = 5643) compared with 9. 5 μm (n = 4440) for controls. Furthermore, animal implantation studies reveal that PP invokes little adverse tissue response compared with poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) ...|$|R
