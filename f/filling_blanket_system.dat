40|$|Neutronics {{performances}} of advanced self-cooled liquid <b>blanket</b> <b>systems</b> {{have been investigated}} in design activity of the helical-type reactor FFHR 2. In the present study, a new three-dimensional (3 -D) neutronics calculation system has been developed for the helical-type reactor to enhance quick feedback between neutronics evaluation and design modification. Using this new calculation system, advanced Flibe-cooled and Li-cooled liquid <b>blanket</b> <b>systems</b> proposed for FFHR 2 have been evaluated to make clear design issues to enhance neutronics performance. Based on calculated results, modification of the blanket dimensions and configuration have been attempted to achieve the adequate tritium breeding ability and neutron shielding performance in the helical reactor. The total tritium breeding ratios (TBRs) obtained after modifying the blanket dimensions indicated that all the advanced <b>blanket</b> <b>systems</b> proposed for FFHR 2 would achieve adequate tritium self-sufficiency by dimension adjustment and optimization of structures in the breeder layers. Issues in neutron shielding performance have been investigated quantitatively using 3 -D geometry of the helical <b>blanket</b> <b>system,</b> support structures, poroidal coils etc. Shielding performance of the helical coils against direct neutrons from core plasma would achieve design target by further optimization of shielding materials. However, suppression of the neutron streaming and reflection through the divertor pumping areas in the original design is important issue to protect the poroidal coils and helical coils, respectively. Investigation of the neutron wall loading indicated that the peaking factor of the neutron wall load distribution would be moderated by the toroidal and helical effect of the plasma distribution in the helical reactor. ...|$|R

40|$|A new {{conceptual}} {{design of the}} laser fusion power plant FALCON-D (Fast ignition Advanced Laser fusion reactor CONcept with a Dry wall chamber) has been proposed. The fast ignition method can achieve the sufficient fusion gain for a commercial operation (~ 100) with about 10 times smaller fusion yield than the conventional central ignition method. FALCON-D makes full use of this property and aims at designing with a compact dry wall chamber (5 ~ 6 m radius). 1 -D/ 2 -D hydrodynamic simulations showed {{the possibility of the}} sufficient gain achievement with a 40 MJ target yield. The design feasibility of the compact dry wall chamber and solid breeder <b>blanket</b> <b>system</b> was shown through the thermomecanical analysis of the dry wall and neutronics analysis of the <b>blanket</b> <b>system.</b> A moderate electric output (~ 400 MWe) can be achieved with a high repetition (30 Hz) laser. This dry wall concept not only reduces some difficulties accompanied with a liquid wall but also enables a simple cask maintenance method for the replacement of the <b>blanket</b> <b>system,</b> which can shorten the maintenance time.

To minimise further heat loss, a range of insulating systems are available to mountain rescue teams although {{the most effective and}} cost-efficient have yet to be determined. Methods: Under ambient, still, dry, air conditions, a thermal manikin was filled with water at a temperature of 42 °C and then placed into a given insulation system. Water temperature was then continuously observed via an in-dwelling temperature sensor linked to a PROPAQ 100 series monitor and recorded every 10 min for 130 min. This method was repeated for each insulating package. Results: The vacuum mattress/Pertex©/fibrepile <b>blanket</b> <b>system,</b> either on its own or coupled with the Wiggy bag, was the most efficient with water temperatures only decreasing by 3. 2 °C over 130 min.

Conclusions: Under the still-air conditions of the study, the vacuum mattress/Pertex©/fibrepile blanket was seen to offer comparable insulation effectiveness compared to be both heavy-weight casualty bags.

50|$|Since ACE {{introduced}} its valve many companies have engineered their own versions. Though {{many of the}} products available vary in features and applicability, the fundamental design is the same. When the pressure inside the container drops below a set point, a valve opens and allows the blanketing gas to enter. Once the pressure reaches the set point, the valve closes. As a safety feature, many systems include a pressure vent that opens when the pressure inside exceeds a maximum pressure set point. This helps to prevent the container from rupturing due to high pressure.

40|$|The <b>blanket</b> <b>system</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} components in a fusion reactor because it has a major impact on both the economics and safety of fusion energy. The primary functions of the blanket in a deuterium/tritium-fueled fusion reactor are to convert the fusion energy into sensible heat and to breed tritium for the fuel cycle. The liquid-metal blanket concept requires an electrically insulating coating on the first-wall structural material to minimize the magnetohydrodynamic pressure drop that occurs during the flow of liquid metal in a magnetic field.

40|$|An {{aggressive}} low {{aspect ratio}} scoping fusion reactor design {{indicated that a}} 2 GW(e) reactor can have a major radius as small as 2. 9 m resulting in a device with competitive cost of electricity at 49 mill/kWh. One of the technology requirements of this design is a high performance high power density first wall and <b>blanket</b> <b>system.</b> A 15 MPa helium-cooled, V-alloy and stagnant LiPb breeder first wall and blanket design was utilized. Due to the low solubility of tritium in LiPb, there is the concern of tritium migration {{and the formation of}} V-hydride. To address these issues, a lithium breeder system with high solubility of tritium has been evaluated. Due to the reduction of blanket energy multiplication to 1. 2, to maintain a plant Q of > 4, the major radius of the reactor has to be increased to 3. 05 m. The inlet helium coolant temperature is raised to 436 C {{in order to meet the}} minimum V-alloy temperature limit everywhere in the first wall and <b>blanket</b> <b>system.</b> To enhance the first wall heat transfer, a swirl tape coolant channel design is used. The corresponding increase in friction factor is also taken into consideration. To reduce the coolant system pressure drop, the helium pressure is increased from 15 to 18 MPa. Thermal structural analysis is performed for a simple tube design. With an inside tube diameter of 1 cm and a wall thickness of 1. 5 mm, the lithium breeder can remove an average heat flux and neutron wall loading of 2 and 8 MW/m(2), respectively. This reference design can meet all the temperature and material structural design limits, as well as the coolant velocity limits. Maintaining an outlet coolant temperature of 650 C, one can expect a gross closed cycle gas turbine thermal efficiency of 45 %. This study further supports the use of helium coolant for high power density reactor design.

Their anaerobic biodegradation pathways and toxicity loading limits were determined. It {{was found that}} ortho positioned chlorine was readily removed from tri- and dichlorophenols. With acclimation, meta position chlorine was also removed from 3, 4 -, 3, 5 -dichlorophenols. Although {{there was no evidence}} of 3 - and 4 -monochlorophenol being degraded, the mass balance of the chlorophenols indicated that more than 50 % of the 3 -monochlorophenol formed from its parent compounds had disappeared, and the disappearance of 4 -monochlorophenol was 20 %. Acclimation and adequate alternate carbon sources reduced inhibition by chlorophenols. Inhibition was caused by: 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenol at a specific loading rate of 0. 3 mg/g volatile suspended solids (hydraulic retention time of 3 days) and 0. 9 mg/g volatile suspended solids (hydraulic retention time of 1 day); 2, 3, 4 -trichlorophenol at a specific loading rate of 2. 5 mg/g volatile suspended solids (hydraulic retention time of 1 day); 2, 3, 5 -trichlorophenol at a specific loading rate of 1. 25 mg/g volatile suspended solids (hydraulic retention time of 1 day); 3, 5 -dichlorophenol at a specific loading rate of 3. 0 mg/g volatile suspend solids (hydraulic retention time of 1 day). The sorption isotherms of all the mono-, di- tri-chlorophenols as well as pentachlorophenol were determined. Biosorption of chlorophenols by anaerobic granular biomass fitted the Freundlich model. Biosorption of chlorophenols increased with increasing halogenation of the chlorophenols. The conditions used in batch sorption tests were similar to those in upflow anaerobic sludge <b>blanket</b> <b>systems.</b> The biosorption constants determined were successfully used to estimate the amount of chlorophenols sorbed by biomass in upflow anaerobic sludge <b>blanket</b> <b>systems.</b> Biosorption accounted for as much as 6 % of the total chlorophenol removal.
