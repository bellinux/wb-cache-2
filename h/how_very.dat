5|$|The Japanese Army and Navy {{had their}} own {{independent}} atomic-bomb programs and therefore the Japanese understood enough to know <b>how</b> <b>very</b> difficult building it would be. Therefore, many Japanese {{and in particular the}} military members of the government refused to believe the United States had built an atomic bomb, and the Japanese military ordered their own independent tests to determine the cause of Hiroshima's destruction. Admiral Soemu Toyoda, the Chief of the Naval General Staff, argued that even if the United States had made one, they could not have many more. American strategists, having anticipated a reaction like Toyoda's, planned to drop a second bomb shortly after the first, to convince the Japanese that the U.S. had a large supply.|$|E
5|$|The {{next night}} is Krusty's {{farewell}} special, and as Krusty describes {{the history of}} his career, Bob straps Bart with explosives in order to kill Krusty. Bart attempts to hug Krusty, thereby setting off the explosives, but before he can, Krusty talks to the audience about how he regrets mistreating Sideshow Bob, holding himself responsible of turning Bob into a ruthless criminal. Krusty even goes far by singing a song on behalf of Bob, stating <b>how</b> <b>very</b> remorseful he is of mistreating him. Upon witnessing this, Bob is touched and develops a change of heart, but does {{not have time to}} stop his original plan from being carried out. Luckily, Krusty's trained chimp Mr. Teeny sees the life-threatening explosives, which he throws into the network executives' office, killing all the executives, though they would later reanimate themselves like the T-1000 from Terminator 2. Bart comes out of his hypnotic state and he and his family serve dinner with Krusty, Bob and Sideshow Mel in a restaurant. Although Krusty and Bob reconcile, police decide to execute Bob by guillotine for his plot of attempted murder, although he argues with Chief Wiggum that he should have a trial for it at least.|$|E

5|$|Where ν and Ediff are as {{described}} above, Γ is the jump or hopping rate, T is temperature, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. Ediff must be {{smaller than the}} energy of desorption for diffusion to occur, otherwise desorption processes would dominate. Importantly, equation 1 tells us <b>how</b> <b>very</b> strongly the jump rate varies with temperature. The manner in which diffusion takes place {{is dependent on the}} relationship between Ediff and kBT as is given in the thermodynamic factor: when Ediff < kBT the thermodynamic factor approaches unity and Ediff ceases to be a meaningful barrier to diffusion. This case, known as mobile diffusion, is relatively uncommon and has only been observed in a few systems. For the phenomena described throughout this article, it is assumed that Ediff >> kBT and therefore Γ << ν. In the case of Fickian diffusion it is possible to extract both the ν and Ediff from an Arrhenius plot of the logarithm of the diffusion coefficient, D, versus 1/T. For cases where more than one diffusion mechanism is present (see below), there may be more than one Ediff such that the relative distribution between the different processes would change with temperature.|$|E

The script and story have evident connections to Cook's own life – his then wife Judy Huxtable plays Walter's wife. Cook's struggles with alcohol are mirrored in Haig's drinking, {{and there is a}} parallel between the fictional divorce of Walter and Lulu and Cook's own divorce from his first wife. The voice and accent Cook used for the character of Stapleton {{are similar to those of}} Cook's Beyond the Fringe colleague, Alan Bennett, and a book on Cook's comedy, <b>How</b> <b>Very</b> Interesting, speculates that the characters Cook plays in Consequences are caricatures of the four Beyond The Fringe cast members – the alcoholic Haig represents Cook, the tremulous Stapleton is Bennett, the parodically Jewish Pepperman is Miller, and the pianist Blint represents Moore.|$|E

25|$|In 1890 Nyström won a state {{grant to}} travel and study abroad, {{studying}} at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1890-91, and travelling throughout Europe. He travelled to Italy and Greece, exploring the ancient architecture, as well as around France and to England, where he was {{particularly interested in the}} medieval church architecture. During his time abroad he kept detailed notebooks and sketchbooks (nowadays held in the Museum of Finnish Architecture archives). In 1892, soon after returning to Finland, he was appointed assistant lecturer at the Polytechnic Institute (founded 1879), where he himself had previously been a student, a position he held {{for the rest of his}} life, and where the head of the school at the time was Gustaf Nyström. He was a highly skilled draftsman and his talent was used first in teaching linear and free-hand drawing. In 1901 he was promoted to lecturer in architecture, teaching ancient and medieval architecture and their styles, along with exercises in design and drawing. For many years Nyström also taught ornamentation and style history at the Central School of Applied Arts in Helsinki (precursor to the present-day Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture). He received the honorary title of professor in 1922. It has often been noted by his former students <b>how</b> <b>very</b> popular he was as a teacher, in part due to his keen sense of humour but also in conveying something of his drawing skills to the students. He also had a significant role in spreading the Art Nouveau style to several generations of students.|$|E

[...] The Huffington Post said, [...] "previously it had been unfathomable that students in Baghdad might be experiencing the same ephemeral and narcissistic heartbreak as we are in the United States." [...] Farhi and Nicholls noticed that the Iraqi students do the same things as American high school students, such as listening to rap music, trying to study without distractions, playing sports, becoming stressed over their final exams and acting silly with their friends. Perigard commented, [...] "despite the cultural differences, Ali, Anmar, Hayder and Mohammad will seem instantly familiar to anyone who has spent time around a teenage boy.

2500|$|Aleister Crowley {{had great}} admiration {{for the use of}} the ouija board and it played a passing role in his magical workings. Jane Wolfe, who lived with Crowley at Abbey of Thelema, also used the Ouija board. She credits some of her {{greatest}} spiritual communications to use of this implement. Crowley also discussed the Ouija board with another of his students, and the most ardent of them, Frater Achad (Charles Stansfeld Jones): it is frequently mentioned in their unpublished letters. In 1917 Achad experimented with the board as a means of summoning Angels, as opposed to Elementals. In one letter Crowley told Jones: [...] "Your Ouija board experiment is rather fun. You see <b>how</b> <b>very</b> satisfactory it is, but I believe things improve greatly with practice. I think you should keep to one angel, and make the magical preparations more elaborate." [...] Over the years, both became so fascinated by the board that they discussed marketing their own design. Their discourse culminated in a letter, dated February 21, 1919, in which Crowley tells Jones, [...] "Re: Ouija Board. I offer you the basis of ten percent of my net profit. You are, if you accept this, responsible for the legal protection of the ideas, and the marketing of the copyright designs. I trust that this may be satisfactory to you. I hope to let you have the material in the course of a week." [...] In March, Crowley wrote to Achad to inform him,"I'll think up another name for Ouija." [...] But their business venture never came to fruition and Crowley's new design, along with his name for the board, has not survived. Crowley has stated, of the Ouija Board that, ...|$|E
