From this point, Bus. US23 ran east on Lafayette Avenue for two blocks and then turned northward onto Garfield Avenue, running parallel to, but inland from, the Saginaw River into downtown Bay City. As it approached downtown, the business loop <b>jogged</b> off Garfield onto Washington Avenue. At the intersection with 7th Street, Bus. US23 turned westward to cross the Saginaw River. On the opposite side, the business loop followed Jenny Street westbound and Thomas Street eastbound along a one-way pairing of streets. At the intersection with US23 (Euclid Avenue), the business loop terminated.|$|E
5|$|M-49 {{was added}} to the state highway system in 1930, running along its current routing between M-9 (now M-99) in Litchfield and the Ohio state line south of Camden. Near the state line, the highway <b>jogged</b> along Territorial Road for a short {{distance}} to make the connection with the continuation of SR49. The second version of M-120 ran concurrently with M-49 on this section of Territorial Road starting in 1939. This concurrency was removed in late 1946 or early 1947 when M-49 was realigned to smooth out the corners in the roadway at M-120. The routing of M-49 has remained the same since. It is currently the only state highway that connects with a like-numbered state highway from another state. The only other highways in Michigan to share a number with a cross-border connection are components of the Interstate Highway System or the United States Numbered Highways.|$|E
5|$|Late in Friday's {{first season}} in Wales, Cardiff took on Luton Town on 16 April 1977. Cardiff {{were in the}} relegation zone and had not won in seven games, while Luton were fifth in the table and {{challenging}} for promotion. After clashing repeatedly early in the match with Luton goalkeeper Milija Aleksic, Friday was lectured by the referee for a high tackle on the goalkeeper in the 36th minute. Friday held {{out a hand to}} apologise, but Aleksic reacted angrily. When the free kick was taken, Friday ran back, stole the ball from Luton defender John Faulkner, broke away, rounded Aleksic and slotted the ball past him into the net. In celebration, Friday <b>jogged</b> back past the goalkeeper while giving him the V-sign. Cardiff won the match 4–2 {{and at the end of}} the season avoided relegation to the third tier only on goal difference. Meanwhile, without Friday, Reading were relegated back to the Fourth Division by one point. Friday's actions became even stranger during his time at Cardiff; after they lost the second leg of the Welsh Cup final 3–0 to Shrewsbury Town on 18 May 1977, the players and staff were awoken in the middle of the night by loud bangs coming from below their rooms. The cause was found to be Friday, standing on the hotel's snooker table in his underpants and throwing the balls around the room in fury.|$|E

25|$|State Highway 168 was {{designated}} in 1932-1934 along a route {{similar to the}} present SH 42, but using {{a number of different}} roadways. It began on SH 7 in the same place and headed south on 95th Street, but the S-curve was not in place and it <b>jogged</b> east on Baseline Road to reach 96th Street. SH 168 then <b>jogged</b> west on South Boulder Road across the railroad to Louisville's Main Street, and turned east on Pine Street, crossing SH 42 onto Empire Road. This street curves south to meet SH 42 at the current city limits of Louisville, after which SH 168 followed SH 42 to end at SH 1 (now US 287). In 1953 the state highway system was greatly reduced and SH 168 disappeared. The loop through Louisville returned to the system in 1960-1961 with a new number: State Highway 42. Two new segments of road were built in about 1970, giving SH 42 its current shape (but initially a sweeping curve carried traffic around the corner east of downtown Louisville).|$|E

Winter quoted, out of context, Edmonds' advice to his researchers to write a draft narrative first, then invite interviewees to comment over lunch: Andrew Green, in his study of the Official History, wrote that this was done deliberately, for memories to be <b>jogged</b> by the draft narrative and that senior officers {{were more likely to be}} frank if approached informally.

25|$|The committal {{hearing to}} {{determine}} if there was sufficient evidence for Einem to stand trial for murder began on 20 February 1984. Faced with irrefutable evidence from prosecutors that Kelvin had been in his company, Einem suddenly changed his story to answer that evidence and admitted that he had been in contact with Richard Kelvin on the night of 5 June 1983. Einem said that he was driving along O'Connell Street in North Adelaide looking for a parking spot in order to buy some dinner. While looking for a parking spot in a side street, Einem said that he had nearly run over Kelvin as he <b>jogged</b> in from his side. Einem stated he thought Kelvin had bisexual tendencies and said {{that the two of them}} then had a conversation about problems Kelvin had been having at school, and Kelvin willingly got into the car and they drove to Einem's home. This answered the question of how fibres from Einem's carpet had got onto Kelvin's clothes. To answer evidence about how fibres from Einem's bed had come to be on Kelvin's clothes, Einem stated that the two of them had sat on his bed and played with the large harp which he kept in his bedroom. Police previously did see this harp in his room when they seized the drugs. Finally, to answer evidence about how fibres from Einem's cardigan had got onto Kelvin, Einem stated that he had put his arm around Kelvin and hugged him because Kelvin was upset about how his peers had been bullying him at school. With all the fibres being accounted for with his new story, Einem concluded his statement by saying that Kelvin had stayed for two hours before Einem dropped him off in the Adelaide CBD near the Royal Adelaide Hospital and gave Kelvin $20 to pay for a taxi home.|$|E

40|$|This master thesis aims {{to create}} a deeper {{understanding}} of the conditions for <b>jogging</b> in the everyday landscape. It examines the structures that may support it, and how they can be created. Through a literature study, I examine what research says about the importance of urban planning in promoting <b>jogging,</b> as well as what supportive structures for <b>jogging</b> in the everyday landscape consist of. The conclusions of the literature are applied practically through analysis in the studied everyday landscape, Flemingsberg. Based on the literature study’s conclusions and the analysis results, I develop demands and thresholds for <b>jogging</b> which exemplifies a possible approach to achieve {{a deeper understanding of}} the landscape of <b>jogging.</b> Finally, I give a suggestion on how <b>jogging,</b> from a public health perspective, can be promoted in Flemingsberg. The study shows that supportive structures for <b>jogging,</b> such as <b>jogging</b> trails and exercise facilities, are important elements of the landscape of <b>jogging,</b> but should only be considered as a part of it. Since <b>jogging</b> often starts right at the front door the everyday landscape should be seen as its whole. In urban planning movement is usually seen as a functional form of displacement. To reach a holistic perspective and {{a deeper understanding of the}} landscape of <b>jogging</b> the activity needs to be treated as a mobility, where the experience of the movement is central. Physical activity in public space reflects societal norms and structures. A deeper understanding of the various needs and preferences for <b>jogging</b> require that specific audiences are defines and included in the planning of the everyday landscape. It also requires that public health research theory is translated into concrete requirements and thresholds of what is sufficient and necessary to promote physical activity and <b>jogging.</b> If these concrete requirements are then practically applied within urban planning, an understanding of the supportive structures for <b>jogging</b> in the everyday landscape can be fully reached.
