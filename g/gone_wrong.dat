5|$|The {{project was}} {{eventually}} canceled by the Air Force in January 1959, seemingly {{out of fear}} of a negative public reaction and the risk to the population should anything have <b>gone</b> <b>wrong</b> with the launch. Another factor, cited by project leader Leonard Reiffel, was the possible implications of the nuclear fallout for future lunar research projects and colonization.|$|E
5|$|Both events, not {{connected}} publicly for several weeks, caused the curious {{to visit the}} website ilovebees.com. The site, which appeared to be dedicated to honey sales and beekeeping, was covered in confusing random characters and sentence fragments. Dana, the ostensible webmaster of the ilovebees site, created a weblog stating that something had <b>gone</b> <b>wrong</b> with her website, and the site itself had been hacked. Suspecting {{that this was a}} mystery that could be unraveled, Halo and ARG fans spread the link and began to work on figuring out what was going on.|$|E

With the Landlord arrested, Thongs and Octopus take care of the baby for a short time, developing strong bonds with him. Reluctant to hand the baby over, the two are forced to protect him from the triads who hired them in the first place.|$|E

5|$|The {{defense of}} Machias {{consisted}} of local militia {{under the command}} of Colonel Jonathan Eddy, the leader of the 1776 attack on Fort Cumberland. He had been warned that the British were organizing an attack. The militia laid a log boom across the Machias River, and constructed several earthen redoubts further upriver, armed with cannons taken from local privateers. The defense was coincidentally reinforced by forty to fifty Maliseet, Passamaquoddy, and Penobscots that Colonel Allan had called to Machias to explain what had <b>gone</b> <b>wrong</b> with his expedition.|$|E
5|$|On April 3, 1921, {{while visiting}} friends in Greenwich Village, Hepburn {{discovered}} {{the body of}} her adored older brother, Tom, dead from an apparent suicide. He had tied a sheet around a beam and hanged himself. The Hepburn family denied it was suicide and maintained that Tom's death {{must have been an}} experiment that had <b>gone</b> <b>wrong.</b> The incident made the teenage Hepburn nervous, moody, and suspicious of people. She shied away from other children, dropped out of Oxford School, and began receiving private tutoring. For many years she used Tom's birthday (November 8) as her own. It was not until her 1991 autobiography, Me: Stories of My Life, that Hepburn revealed her true birth date.|$|E
5|$|On 8 January 1967, the VPAF High Command {{convened a}} meeting to examine what had <b>gone</b> <b>wrong.</b> The actions of 2 January had exposed the flawed tactics {{employed}} by MiG-21 pilots; they broke through the clouds too quickly, {{and they did not}} join up with each other before they attacked the U.S. fighters waiting above them. The VPAF High Command then devised a new tactic which required the deployment of between two or four aircraft for each attack, with a maximum of ten aircraft for each mission to perform guerrilla-style attacks on U.S. bomber formations. Furthermore, after they had examined U.S. air tactics, North Vietnamese commanders decided that MiG-17 pilots should attack U.S. formations from either side, while MiG-21 pilots would strike from above. Before the North Vietnamese Air Force could implement their new tactics, however, the VPAF 921st Fighter Regiment was withdrawn from combat for several months to recover from the bloody defeat it had suffered as a result of Operation Bolo.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} {{explanation}} for the sinking among modern historians is that the ship was unstable {{for a number of}} reasons. When a strong gust of wind hit the sails at a critical moment, the open gunports proved fatal, the ship flooded and quickly foundered. Coates offered a variant of this hypothesis, which explains why a ship which served for several decades without sinking, and which even fought in actions in the rough seas off Brittany, unexpectedly foundered: the ship had accumulated additional weight over the years in service and finally become unseaworthy. That the ship was turning after firing all the cannons on one side has been questioned by Marsden after examination of guns recovered in both the 19th and 20th centuries; guns from both sides were found still loaded. This has been interpreted to mean that something else could have <b>gone</b> <b>wrong</b> since it is assumed that an experienced crew would not have failed to secure the gunports before making a potentially risky turn.|$|E

50|$|According to David J. Hand, emeritus {{professor}} {{of mathematics and}} senior research investigator at Imperial College London, Sod's law is a more extreme version of Murphy's law. While Murphy's law says that anything that can <b>go</b> <b>wrong,</b> will <b>go</b> <b>wrong</b> (eventually), Sod's law requires that it always <b>goes</b> <b>wrong</b> with the worst possible outcome. Hand suggests that belief in Sod's law {{is a combination of}} the law of truly large numbers and the psychological effect of the law of selection. The former says we should expect things to <b>go</b> <b>wrong</b> now and then, and the latter says we remember the exceptional events where something <b>went</b> <b>wrong,</b> but the great number of mundane events where nothing exceptional happened are forgotten.|$|R
