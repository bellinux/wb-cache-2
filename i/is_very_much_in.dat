5|$|George Gilbert Scott, the {{architect}} of ChristChurch Cathedral, and an empathiser of Mountfort's teacher and mentor Carpenter, wished his former pupil Mountfort to be the clerk of works and supervising architect of the new cathedral project. This proposal was originally vetoed by the Cathedral Commission. Nevertheless, following delays in the building work attributed to financial problems, the position of supervising architect was finally given to Mountfort in 1873. Mountfort was responsible for several alterations to the absentee main architect's design, most obviously the tower and the west porch. He also designed the font, the Harper Memorial, and the north porch. The cathedral was however not finally completed until 1904, six years after Mountfort's death. The cathedral <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> the European decorated Gothic style with an attached campanile tower beside {{the body of the}} cathedral, rather than towering directly above it in the more English tradition.|$|E
5|$|The {{novel is}} set in Regency England somewhere around 1818, and events are related through third-person narrative. As the story opens, a wealthy, {{beautiful}} and intelligent woman named Annis Wychwood reaches the age of majority. Now having greater control over her personal and financial affairs, Annis decides to move to Bath and live alone, to the displeasure of her brother and his family. Several years later, {{on the way back}} to Bath after a visit to her childhood home, Annis meets Lucilla Carleton and Ninian Elmore. Lucilla is running away to Bath to avoid her marriage to Ninian, a match that her guardian <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> favour of, and Ninian is escorting her to ensure her safe arrival. Annis volunteers to chaperone Lucilla and notifies the girl's guardian of her plans.|$|E
25|$|The name Derry <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> popular use {{throughout}} Ireland for {{the naming}} of places, and {{there are at least}} six towns bearing that name and at least a further 79 places. The word Derry often forms part of the place name, for example Derrybeg, Derryboy, Derrylea and Derrymore.|$|E

25|$|The Irish {{element of}} Puerto Rico <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> evidence. Their {{contributions}} to the archipelago's agricultural industry and {{in the fields of}} politics and education are highly notable. In the city of Bayamón, there is an urbanization called Irlanda Heights (Ireland Heights). For the last several years, the town of Luquillo has hosted a day-long Saint Patrick's Day festival which includes a Desfile de San Patricio (St. Patrick's Parade) honoring Ireland's chief patron saint. There are various Irish pubs around the island which also celebrate the holiday and serve the typical green colored beer on the occasion. Among them are Shannon's Irish Pub in San Juan, and Logan's Irish Pub in Río Piedras.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the ancient}} history of Azerbaijan the Azeris {{have created a}} rich and {{distinctive}} culture, {{a major part of}} which is decorative and applied art. This form of art rooted in hoary antiquity is represented by a wide range of handicrafts, such as chasing, jeweler, engraving in metal, carving in wood, stone and bone, carpet-making, lasing, pattern weaving and printing, knitting and embroidery. Each of these types of decorative art, evidence and endowments of the Azerbaijan nation, <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> favor here. Many interesting facts pertaining to the development of arts and crafts in Azerbaijan were reported by numerous merchants, travelers and diplomats who had visited these places at different times.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} {{structure of}} the play <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> keeping with that of Japanese traditional drama forms as a whole. The philosophy of jo-ha-kyū is employed throughout, as actions, scenes, acts, and the play as a whole begin slow (jo), then get faster (ha), and end quickly (kyū). Also, Sugawara follows the traditional five-act structure and the themes traditionally associated with particular acts. Act One begins calmly and auspiciously, including scenes at the Imperial Palace. Act Two features combat and murder. Act Three {{is something of a}} sewamono insertion into the jidaimono tale, turning away from the affairs of warriors and politics to focus on the lives of commoners. Act Four, often in other plays a michiyuki journey, metaphorically associated with a journey through hell, features a dramatic storm and an emotional journey for Kan Shōjō, who becomes enraged at the traitorous activities of Shihei, and kills himself, becoming a thunder god. Act Five wraps up the plot quickly and returns to themes of auspiciousness.|$|E

25|$|After {{consolidating}} {{his political}} position through military campaigns, diplomacy, and a firm domestic administration, Suryavarman launched into {{the construction of}} Angkor Wat as his personal temple mausoleum. Breaking with {{the tradition of the}} Khmer kings, and influenced perhaps by the concurrent rise of Vaisnavism in India, he dedicated the temple to Vishnu rather than to Siva. With walls nearly half a mile long on each side, Angkor Wat grandly portrays the Hindu cosmology, with the central towers representing Mount Meru, home of the gods; the outer walls, the mountains enclosing the world; and the moat, the oceans beyond. The traditional theme of identifying the Khmer devaraja with the gods, and his residence with that of the celestials, <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> evidence. The measurements themselves of the temple and its parts in relation to one another have cosmological significance. Suryavarman had the walls of the temple decorated with bas reliefs depicting not only scenes from mythology, but also from the life of his own imperial court. In one of the scenes, the king himself is portrayed as larger in size than his subjects, sitting cross-legged on an elevated throne and holding court, while a bevy of attendants make him comfortable with the aid of parasols and fans.|$|E

500|$|In April 2011 Grant {{published}} {{an article in the}} New Statesman entitled [...] "The Bugger, Bugged" [...] about a conversation (following an earlier encounter) with Paul McMullan, a former journalist and paparazzo for News of the World. In unguarded comments which were secretly taped by Grant, McMullan alleged that editors at the Daily Mail and News of the World, particularly Andy Coulson, had ordered journalists to engage in illegal phone tapping and had done so with the full knowledge of senior British politicians. McMullan also said that every British Prime Minister from Margaret Thatcher onwards had cultivated a close relationship with Rupert Murdoch and his senior executives. He stressed the friendship between David Cameron and Rebekah Brooks (née Wade), agreeing when asked that both of them must have been aware of illegal phone tapping, and asserting that Cameron's inaction could be explained by self-interest: [...] "Cameron <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> debt to Rebekah Wade for helping him not quite win the election ... So that was my submission to parliament – that Cameron's either a liar or an idiot." ...|$|E

500|$|Spins Colin Joyce was {{impressed}} by [...] "Start a War". He stated that [...] "the number {{seems to be the}} sort of skyward ballad that [...] has made her wheelhouse" [...] and found it to be [...] "a good look for Stefani". Stassa Edwards of Jezebel was equally positive, declaring that it [...] "has all of the hallmarks of a Sia ballad – those mournful, moody bridges that Sia does so well". Edwards concluded by saying she enjoyed the feathery-inspired setup that accompanied Stefani's performance. Richard Baxter, a blogger on Popology Now, largely praised the track. He wrote: [...] "As expected, 'Start a War' <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> the veins of a typical Sia ballad. Same sound, same melodies, yet Gwen makes the song her own by not channeling Sia's vocals." [...] Baxter continued: [...] "It's got a bit of radio appeal, at least from what we can understand, and Gwen sounds pretty phenomenal." [...] Also writing of Stefani's vocals, Julien Goncalves on the French website Purebreak Charts was pleased that the [...] "aerial" [...] song was strong enough to emphasize her voice.|$|E
500|$|You Only Live Twice was {{published}} in the UK on 16 March 1964, by Jonathan Cape and cost sixteen shillings. There were 62,000 pre-orders for the book, a significant increase over the 42,000 advance orders for the hardback first edition of On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Richard Chopping, cover artist for The Spy Who Loved Me, was engaged for the design. On 17 July 1963, Michael Howard of Jonathan Cape had written to Chopping about the artwork, saying: [...] "I have had a talk with Ian about the ideas for the ingredients of this design. He <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> favour of the toad... but with a suitable array of oriental embellishrangment, i.e. toad plus Japanese flower arrangements, which he thinks should be sitting in a suitable piece of Japanese pottery, perhaps ornamented with a dragon motif. If you could manage a pink dragonfly sitting on the flowers, and perhaps just one epicanthic eye peering through them he thinks that will be just splendid!" [...] Chopping's fee rose to 300 guineas for the cover, a rise from the 250 guineas he received for The Spy Who Loved Me.|$|E
500|$|The 1948 Australian {{team has}} great {{significance}} in cricket history {{as it is}} the only side to tour England unbeaten, earning the sobriquet The Invincibles. The tour was captain Donald Bradman's last Test series, and the immediate postwar team was the most successful that Bradman appeared in. It has been claimed that English cricket suffered more heavily from the effects of World War II than the Australians. Even so, various commentators have rated the 1948 Australians {{as one of the best}} cricket teams ever, and it is often compared to other great outfits such as the 1902 Australian touring team, Warwick Armstrong's Australian side of just after World War I, the West Indies team of the 1980s and the Australian team of the 1990s and 2000s. This was not a view shared by Jack Fingleton, Bradman's batting rival from the 1930s, who wrote 'the 1948 Australian side to England, side that some critics, ignoring the apparent lack of strength in English cricket that season, dubbed the [...] "best Australian team ever" [...] – which was just moonshine. Yorkshire almost beat the Australians of 1948', but his view <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> the minority.|$|E

500|$|At {{a private}} meeting held in May 2007 between developers, EnergieKontor UK, and invited local councillors, plans were put forward for another large wind farm {{consisting}} of 24turbines on the moors above nearby Haslingden, spanning Thirteen Stone Hill and Oswaldtwistle Moor. Following the meeting Catherine Pilling, a Rossendale Liberal Democrat councillor, expressed her view that {{the natural beauty of}} the Rossendale Valley was under threat as it was increasingly being targeted by wind farm developers. [...] "Our party <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> favour of renewable energy," [...] she said, [...] "but Rossendale is an area of outstanding beauty, and you have to ask: Would they be building a similar thing in the Lake District?" [...] Rossendale Borough Council leader Duncan Ruddick representing the electoral ward of Worsley in Rossendale, the proposed site of the new wind farm, said he was against wind farms and would be campaigning against it and speaking at the Development Control committee when it came. The leader of the Labour local councillors was also opposed to the plan, saying that he was concerned {{about the size of the}} turbines and that the visual impact on the [...] "beautiful West Pennine Moors" [...] would be devastating. Planning permission for the development was granted by Hyndburn Council in March 2010.|$|E
500|$|Magical Mystery Tour, {{the soundtrack}} to a {{forthcoming}} Beatles television film, {{was released in}} the UK as a six-track double extended play disc (EP) in early December 1967. In the United States, the six songs were issued on an identically titled LP that also included five tracks from the band's recent singles. Unterberger says of the US Magical Mystery Tour, [...] "the psychedelic sound <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> the vein of Sgt. Pepper, and even spacier in parts (especially the sound collages of 'I Am the Walrus')" [...] and he calls its five songs culled from the band's 1967 singles [...] "huge, glorious, and innovative". In its first three weeks, the album set a record for the highest initial sales of any Capitol LP, {{and it is the}} only Capitol compilation later to be adopted in the band's official canon of studio albums. First aired on Boxing Day, the Magical Mystery Tour film, largely directed by McCartney, brought the group their first major negative UK press. It was dismissed as [...] "blatant rubbish" [...] by the Daily Express; the Daily Mail called it [...] "a colossal conceit"; and The Guardian labelled the film [...] "a kind of fantasy morality play about the grossness and warmth and stupidity of the audience". Gould describes it as [...] "a great deal of raw footage showing a group of people getting on, getting off, and riding on a bus". Although the viewership figures were respectable, its slating in the press led US television networks to lose interest in broadcasting the film.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from December 31, 1910. It states, [...] "May Smalley is a simple little country girl with whom Jack, a youth whom she has known since childhood, <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> love. When a traveling show, consisting of a hypnotist and a Hindu magician comes to the opera house in her little town, the two young people are among the other interested spectators who flock to see the performance. May's youth and beauty attract the hypnotist, who plans to lure her away from her home. He sends May a message {{that he has a}} communication for her from the spirit world. Against the protest of Jack, her escort, May goes behind the scenes after the performance to meet with the great hypnotist, who fascinates her with his wiles. The hypnotist is an unscrupulous villain, and seeing that May is thoroughly impressed with his few tricks and considers him quite superhuman, he induces her to follow him when he leaves the town. How Jack proves himself to be a youth of resource as well as courage, the important part he played in May's deliverance by the Hindu fakir, is well told by the picture. Finally the hypnotist is shown in his true light. May is disillusioned, and comes to decide that Jack is just about the kind of protection she needs in a world of uncertainty." [...] According to a reviewer, Jack comes up to the stage where the Hindu magician is and knocks him down. Jack takes his costume and follows the hypnotist and May to the hotel where he rescues her.|$|E
