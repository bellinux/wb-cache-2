The nondiagonal {{generalized}} vector dominance model (GVDM) of photoabsorption is elaborated using QCD-motivated {{picture of}} the γ− qqtransition and subsequent meson dominated scattering of the − qq-pair on the nucleon.

These currents increase exponentially as threshold voltage scales, creating a serious problem for traditional design approaches.

It yields a dramatic improvement in power consumption compared to traditional circuit design approaches. This improvement makes it feasible to design extreme low-power circuits with such an approach.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{separate}} determination of two-pole sample volume resistance and contact resistance is suggested. The method is applicable to high-ohmic semiconductor samples: semi-insulating gallium arsenide, detector cadmium-zinc telluride (CZT), etc. The method {{is based on}} near-contact region illumination by monochromatic radiation of variable intensity from light emitting diodes with quantum energies exceeding the band gap of the material. It is necessary to obtain sample photo-current dependence upon light emitting diode current and to find the linear portion of this dependence. Extrapolation of this linear portion to the Y-axis gives the <b>cut-off</b> <b>current.</b> As the bias voltage is known, {{it is easy to}} calculate sample volume resistance. Then, using dark current value, one can determine the total contact resistance. The method was tested for n-type semi-insulating GaAs.

40|$|Terahertz-frequency quantum cascade lasers (THz QCLs) {{based on}} bound-to-continuum active regions are {{difficult}} to model owing to their large number of quantum states. We present a computationally efficient reduced rate equation (RE) model that reproduces the experimentally observed variation of THz power with respect to drive current and heat-sink temperature. We also present dynamic (time-domain) simulations under a range of drive currents and predict an increase in modulation bandwidth as the current approaches {{the peak of the}} light-current curve, as observed experimentally in mid-infrared QCLs. We account for temperature and bias dependence of the carrier lifetimes, gain, and injection efficiency, calculated from a full rate equation model. The temperature dependence of the simulated threshold current, emitted power, and <b>cut-off</b> <b>current</b> are thus all reproduced accurately with only one fitting parameter, the interface roughness, in the full REs. We propose that the model could therefore be used for rapid dynamical simulation of QCL designs. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LL...|$|R

40|$|Terahertz {{frequency}} quantum cascade lasers (THz-QCLs) are compact solid-state {{sources of}} coherent THz radiation over the frequency range 1 – 5 THz. Due {{to the high}} output power, narrow linewidths and broad range of emission frequencies, QCLs have numerous potential applications as radiation sources for imaging and spectroscopy within biomedical or security scenarios, or as local oscillators in heterodyne mixing schemes. Although THz-QCLs are known to exhibit sub-nanosecond dynamic behaviour, transient laser emission on these time-scales cannot be resolved by commercially-available semiconducting Ge or InSb bolometers, owing to the large detection time-constants. We present a time-domain analysis of fast pulses emitted by a quantum cascade laser operating at ~ 3. 1 THz using superconducting THz detectors made from either NbN or YBa(2) Cu(3) O(7 -δ) (YBCO) thin films. The QCL emission was studied {{as a function of}} the QCL bias voltage and the excitation pulse length. The ultra-fast response of superconducting NbN and YBCO detectors allows the resolution of nanosecond-time-scale dynamic laser effects. This enables to determine the QCL transfer function (output power vs. QCL drive current), based on experimentally studied correlations of the time-dependent emission of radiation with current flow in the QCL, under different QCL bias conditions. From the transfer function, specific QCL parameters were determined including the threshold and <b>cut-off</b> <b>currents.</b> We show that this transfer function differs from that obtained using semiconducting bolometric detectors which respond only to the integrated pulse energy...|$|R

Count cut-off points are needed when using accelerometer data to determine the time a person spent in moderate or vigorous physical activity. For the GT 3 X accelerometer no cut-off points for young children have been published yet. The aim {{of the current study}} was thus to develop and validate count cut-off points for young children. Thirty-two children aged 5 to 9 years performed four locomotor and four play activities. Activity classification into the light-, moderate- or vigorous-intensity category was based on energy expenditure measurements with indirect calorimetry. Vertical axis as well as vector magnitude cut-off points were determined through receiver operating characteristic curve analyses with the data of two thirds of the study group and validated with the data of the remaining third. The vertical axis cut-off points were 133 counts per 5 sec for moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), 193 counts for vigorous activity (VPA) corresponding to a metabolic threshold of 5 MET and 233 for VPA corresponding to 6 MET. The vector magnitude cut-off points were 246 counts per 5 sec for MVPA, 316 counts for VPA - 5 MET and 381 counts for VPA - 6 MET.

OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to explore cut-off values for large WC in adults aged 70 years and older, using previously used and new methods. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Data of 1049 participants of the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA) (1995 - 1996), aged 70 - 88 y, were used. MEASUREMENTS: Measured BMI and WC, and self-reported mobility limitations. RESULTS: Linear regression analyses showed that the values of WC corresponding to BMI of 25 kg/m 2 and 30 kg/m 2 were higher than the <b>current</b> <b>cut-offs.</b> Cut-offs found in men were 97 and 110 cm, whereas 88 and 98 cm represented the cut-offs in women. Areas under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves showed that the accuracy to predict mobility limitations improved when the higher cut-offs were applied.

40|$|Leakage power {{reduction}} in nano-CMOS designs has gained tremendous interest both in academia and industry. Many techniques {{have been proposed}} in the literature for leakage power reduction {{and one of the}} prominent techniques for leakage power reduction is the use of sleep transistors as power-gating elements to <b>cut-off</b> sub-threshold leakage <b>current</b> in circuits when they are in stand-by mode. Although sleep transistor insertion is very effective in cutting-off leakage, it also incurs timing, area and routing overhead. Since most of the sleep transistor insertion methodologies do post layout insertion, care should be taken such that there is minimal perturbation of the original layout. Over design of sleep transistors cells and sub-optimal sleep transistor placement must be avoided to achieve final design closure. Since the sleep transistor area plays an important and prominent role in this aspect, it necessitates for optimal sleep transistor sizing and synthesis technique under area constraints. In this paper, we first provide a methodology for optimal sleep transistor synthesis under given area constraints. We then apply our technique to the general timing and area constraint driven row-based power-gating methodology proposed in [13] and show how optimal low leakage designs with constraints on timing and area can be designe...|$|R
