40|$|A non-conventional type {{of heating}} system is being tested at Sandia National Laboratories for solar thermal power tower applications. In this system, called {{impedance}} heating, electric current flows directly through the pipe to maintain the desired temperature. The pipe becomes the resistor where the heat is generated. Impedance heating has many advantages over previously used mineral insulated (MI) heat trace. An impedance heating system should be much more reliable than <b>heat</b> <b>trace</b> <b>cable</b> since delicate junctions and cabling are not used and the main component, a transformer, is inherently reliable. A big advantage of impedance heating is the system can be sized to rapidly heat up the piping to provide rapid response times necessary in cyclic power plants such as solar power towers. In this paper, experimental results from testing an impedance heating system are compared to MI cable heat trace. We found impedance heating was able to heat piping rapidly and effectively. There were not significant stray currents and impedance heating did not affect instrumentation...|$|E

50|$|Electric <b>heat</b> <b>tracing,</b> <b>heat</b> tape or surface heating, is {{a system}} used to {{maintain}} or raise the temperature of pipes and vessels. <b>Trace</b> <b>heating</b> {{takes the form of}} an electrical heating element run in physical contact along the length of a pipe. The pipe must then be covered with thermal insulation to retain heat losses from the pipe.

The contactor or controller may include a thermostat if accurate temperature maintenance is required, or may just shut off a freeze-protection system in mild weather.|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} <b>heat</b> <b>trace</b> {{for both the}} {{drifting}} Laplacian as well as Schrödinger operators on compact Riemannian manifolds. In {{the case of a}} finite regularity potential or weight function, we prove the existence of a partial (six term) asymptotic expansion of the <b>heat</b> <b>trace</b> for small times as well as a suitable remainder estimate. We also demonstrate that the more precise asymptotic behavior of the remainder is determined by and conversely distinguishes higher (Sobolev) regularity on the potential or weight function. In the case of a smooth weight function, we determine the full asymptotic expansion of the <b>heat</b> <b>trace</b> for the drifting Laplacian for small times. We then use the <b>heat</b> <b>trace</b> to study the asymptotics of the eigenvalue counting function. In both cases the Weyl law coincides with the Weyl law for the Riemannian manifold with the standard Laplace-Beltrami operator. We conclude by demonstrating isospectrality results for the drifting Laplacian on compact manifolds...|$|R
