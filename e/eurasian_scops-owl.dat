2500|$|The {{evolutionary}} relationships [...] of the [...] scops and screech owls are {{not entirely}} clear. What is certain {{is that they are}} very closely related; they may be considered sister lineages which fill essentially the same ecological niche in their allopatric ranges. A screech-owl fossil from the Late Pliocene of Kansas – which is almost identical to eastern and western screech owls – indicate a long-standing presence of these birds in the Americas, while [...] scops owl fossils very similar to the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>scops-owl</b> have been found at S'Onix on the Spanish island Majorca. The scops and screech owl lineage probably evolved at some time during the Miocene (like most other genera of typical owls), and the three (see below) [...] modern lineages separated perhaps roughly 5 million years ago. Note that there is no reliable estimate of divergence time, as Otus and Megascops are osteologically very similar, as is to be expected from a group that has apparently conserved its ecomorphology since before its evolutionary radiation. As almost all scops and screech owls today, their common ancestor was in all probability already a small owl, with ear tufts and at least the upper tarsus ("leg") feathered.|$|E

2500|$|Birds from {{a handful}} of families—including raptors, owls, skuas, parrots, turkeys and curassows—have a waxy {{structure}} called a cere (from the Latin cera, which means [...] "wax") or ceroma which covers the base of their bill. This structure typically contains the nares, except in the owls, where the nares are distal to the cere. Although it is sometimes feathered in parrots, the cere is typically bare and often brightly colored. In raptors, the cere is a sexual signal which indicates the [...] "quality" [...] of a bird; the orangeness of a Montague's harrier's cere, for example, correlates to its body mass and physical condition. The cere color of young <b>Eurasian</b> <b>scops-owls</b> has an ultraviolet (UV) component, with a UV peak that correlates to the bird's mass. A chick with a lower body mass has a UV peak at a higher wavelength than a chick with a higher body mass does. Studies have shown that parent owls preferentially feed chicks with ceres that show higher wavelength UV peaks, that is, lighter-weight chicks.|$|R

They are also known to hunt Sakishima rice frogs, yellow-spotted crickets and crabs. As their hunting grounds tend to be in swamps or on shores, they sometimes swim and dive to catch water birds, fish, and freshwater prawns.|$|E

The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Scops-owl</b> was {{considered}} to be sedentary on the Island of Formentera, although its breeding had not been proven. The sightings of a couple in a witch broom of a pine tree allowed us to find four eggs upon first investigation and three chicks afterwards, thus proving the breeding of this species in Formentera...|$|E
40|$|Owls My {{exercise}} was {{a comparison of}} eleven owl species according to their body size differences between the male and the female. The body size data were reverse sexual dimorphism (male/female) in wing and the cube root of weight in Europen owl species. The goal {{of this study is}} to identify phylogenetic relatonships among owl species in the context of female biased body size using reverse sexual dimorphism (RSD). In the source article body size samples were selected with the following guidelines: that an adequate sample be obtained, where possible, weights from the breeding season were avoided because of the great changes that occur in the weights of females at this time, and where possible, weights and wing measurements were from the same locality or region because RSD in wing and weight appear to vary geographically. These samples were extracted from Cramp (1985). This article provides further information on female dominance in intra-pair interactions. The species listed in descending order of estimated relative female dominance: (1) Eurasian Pygmy-Ow (Glaucidium passerinum) : If the male is next to the nest without food when the young are hungry, the female will drive him away. In small cages, females will kill males. (2) Boreal Owl (Aegolius funereus) : When food deliveries are insufficient, the female will leave the nest and chase the male for minutes. (3) Northern Eagle-Owl (Bubo bubo) : No intersexual aggression has been recorded in the wild. But if only one female and male are in a cage, the female will kill the male. (4) Ural Owl (Strix uralensis) : No observations of intrapair aggression in the field, but in captivity the female will show a threat display to her male if he is slow to deliver food. (5) Northern Hawk-Owl (Surnia ulula) : Females react to courting males with aggressive vocalisations and with high intensity threat displays in captivity. (6) Little Owl (Athene noctua) : In small cages, a female strikes strangers of both sexes and will even strike her own male. (7) <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Scops-Owl</b> (Otus scops) : Females will strike strangers of both sexes, males will not attack strange females. Rankings for the female dominance (Mueller 1986) were correlated with RSD in weigh...|$|E
