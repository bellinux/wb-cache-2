Ann Powers of the Los Angeles Times stated, [...] "despite that first-night stumble and several numbers in which her dancing was no more than adequate, Spears can safely call this performance a success". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said that [...] " [...] was less a concert than a Las Vegas-style revue of intimidating complexity. Throughout, though she spoke little, Ms. Spears appeared radiant and unfettered, often smiling and never uncommitted". Dixie Reid of The Sacramento Bee commented that the show was [...] "a mesmerizingly big production with entertaining videos (including the infamous Spears-Madonna kiss), confetti, sparklers and even a stilt-walker. Who could ask for more? <b>Everyone</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have a good time at the circus". Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph said Spears is [...] "the queen of production line pop and reclaims that diamanté crown with the most perfectly plastic pop show ever staged".|$|E
500|$|Retrospectively, the 32X {{is widely}} criticized {{as having been}} under-supported and a poor idea {{in the wake of}} the release of the Sega Saturn. [...] 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish stated that the 32X [...] "tainted just about {{everything}} it touched." [...] GamesRadar also panned the system, placing it as their ninth-worst console with reviewer Mikel Reparaz criticizing that [...] "it was a stopgap system that would be thrown under the bus when the Sega Saturn came out six months later, and <b>everyone</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> know it except for die-hard Sega fans and the company itself." [...] Retro Gamers Damien McFerran offered some praise for the power increase of the 32X to offer ports of Space Harrier, After Burner, and Virtua Fighter that were accurate to the original arcade versions, as well as the add-on's price point, stating, [...] "If you didn't have deep enough pockets to afford a Saturn, then the 32X was a viable option; it's just a shame that it sold so poorly because the potential was there for true greatness." [...] Levi Buchanan, writing for IGN, saw some sense in the move for Sega to create the 32X but criticized its implementation. [...] According to Buchanan, [...] "I actually thought the 32X was a better idea than the SEGA CD... The 32X, while underpowered, at least advanced the ball. Maybe it only gained a few inches in no small part due to a weak library, but at least the idea was the right one." ...|$|E

Postmaster General Edward Short encouraged the Royal Mail to introduce an [...] "I'm Backing Britain" [...] franking mark, which was used on 84 million letters passing through 125 Post Offices between 9 and 29 February. Increased visibility of the Union Flag distressed some commentators.

2500|$|Sackville-West become {{involved}} in planning the coronation of Rezā Khan, and {{got to know the}} six-year old Crown Prince Mohammad Reza fairly well. She noted how the Persian court were obsessed with attempting to ensure the coronation was up to European standards and remarked [...] "there was no point, however humble, on which they would not consult their British friends", with their guidebook being a copy of [...] "the proceedings at Westminster Abbey for the Coronation of His Majesty George V". Much to her amusement, Sackville-West was asked by one Persian minister what a [...] "Rougedragon Poursuivant" [...] was, believing it was a type of animal. On the coronation day, Sackville described waking up to a [...] "Tehran spruce and furnished beyond recognition". At the Golestan Palace, the throne room which housed the fabled Peacock Throne had been [...] "repainted, the garden paved, such breaches in the walls as revealed the presence of rubbish-heaps were to be filled up". Observing the coronation of Rezā Khan upon the Peacock Throne, Sackville-West referred to the Shia clergymen as a [...] "bevy of bearded old men in long robes and turbans" [...] who appeared like the [...] "baleful chorus of a Greek play". Sackville-West noted that <b>everyone</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> dislike the Shia clerics and kept a distance from them. Rezā Khan was due to enter the throne room of the Golestan Palace at precisely 3 pm for the coronation, but Sackville-West noted how everyone become tense when the shah was half an hour late, which caused alarm as Rezā Khan was well known for his punctuality and had his ministers flogged if they were late to cabinet meetings. Finally, the main doors opened and in marched Rezā Khan, dressed in his finest uniform and wearing a blue clock, and everyone fell silent. Despite her disdain for the Persian monarchy as [...] "absurd", Sackville-West found the coronation captivating as she found herself craning her neck to see Rezā Khan march up to the Peacock Throne. Walking besides him was his son, the Crown Prince Mohammad Reza, who she wrote was [...] "frightened, possessed himself of a corner of his father's clock". Finally, Sackville-West noted that Rezā Khan crowned himself. In her account of her visit to the former capital of Isfahan to see the Safavid palaces, Sackville-West's repeated use of the word [...] "we" [...] is misleading as it suggests that only Nicolson accompanied her to Isfahan, when in fact, Raymond Mortimer, her husband's lover also traveled in the same car with them.|$|E

Why, I ask, should it have stopped precisely when a counter- attraction was so necessary? <b>Everyone</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> drift towards the area of disturbance, of which the chairs of the Archdeacon's wife and Reginald formed the storm-centre.

60|$|All was excitement, and for {{the time}} being <b>everyone</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be so dazed that but little was done. Passengers were leaping from both of the wrecked cars, some coming through the doorways and some through the broken-out windows. Jack and Randy ran to one of the cars, and were able to assist a woman with a little girl to alight and reach a place of safety. In the meanwhile, the other lads {{assisted}} two elderly men. One had his foot hurt, and they carried him into the railroad station, where they laid him on one of the benches.|$|E
60|$|No one was kinder {{to me at}} {{that time}} than Rose Waterford. She {{combined}} a masculine intelligence with a feminine perversity, and the novels she wrote were original and disconcerting. It was at her house one day that I met Charles Strickland's wife. Miss Waterford was giving a tea-party, and her small room was more than usually full. <b>Everyone</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be talking, and I, sitting in silence, felt awkward; but I was too shy to break {{into any of the}} groups that seemed absorbed in their own affairs.

As they {{clustered}} in the castle gateway Coote, Kipps remembered afterwards, laid hold of his arm as if by chance and pressed it. It was quite evident he knew. His eyes, his nose, shone with benevolent congratulations, shone, too, {{with the sense of}} a good thing conducted to its climax. Mrs. Walshingham, who had seemed a little fatigued by the hill, recovered, and was even obviously stirred by affection for her daughter. There was, in passing, a motherly caress. She asked Kipps to give her his arm in walking down the steep. Kipps in a sort of dream obeyed. He found himself trying to attend to her, and soon he was attending.|$|E

60|$|The {{station where}} she alighted {{was in a}} hubbub of life; <b>everyone</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> leave the train here, and to resent the {{presence}} of all the others. They were mostly English. The men hung back, as if, now that there was business {{to be done in}} some foolish tongue, they had better leave the ladies to do it. Many of them seemed prepared, if there was dissension, to disown their womankind and run for it. They looked haughty and nervous. Such of them as had tried to shave in the train were boasting of it and holding handkerchiefs to their chins. The ladies were moving about in a masterful way, carrying bunches of keys. When they had done everything, the men went and stood by their sides again.|$|E

She knew her power. When there were women in the room whom she disliked she merely went and stood beside them. In the gyrations of the dance the onlooker would {{momentarily}} lose sight of her; she came and went like a blinking candle. Men could not dance with her without its being said that they were getting stout. There is nothing they dislike so much, yet they did dance with her. Tommy, having some slight reason, was particularly sensitive about references to his figure, yet it was Lady Pippinworth who had drawn him to Switzerland. What was her strange attraction? ...|$|E

60|$|Lady Mary {{held out}} her hands across the tea-tray. Rochester came a few steps forward. Everyone ceased their {{conversation}} {{to look at the}} small, spare figure of the man who, clad in a suit of travelling clothes of gray tweed, and cut after a somewhat ancient pattern, insignificant-looking in figure and even in bearing, yet carried something in his clean-shaven, wrinkled face at once impressive and commanding. <b>Everyone</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> lean forward with a little air of interest, prepared to exchange greetings with him as soon as he had spoken to his host and hostess. Only Saton stood quite still, still as a figure turned suddenly into stone. No one appeared to notice him, to notice the twitching of his fingers, the almost ashen gray of his cheeks--no one except the girl with whom he had been talking, and whose eyes had scarcely left his. He recovered himself quickly. When Rochester turned towards him, a moment or so later, he was almost at his ease.|$|E
60|$|Nina asked anxiously {{whether there}} would not be another fox. Ayala also was anxious lest in {{accepting}} the proffered hospitality she should lose any of the delights of the day. But it was at length arranged that {{a quarter of an hour}} should be allowed before Tony took his hounds over to the Bragton coverts. Immediately Larry was off his horse, rushing into the house and ordering everyone about it to come forth with bread and cheese and sherry and beer. In spite of what he had said of his ruin it was known that Larry Twentyman was a warm man, and that no man in Rufford gave what he had to give with a fuller heart. His house was in the middle of the Rufford and Ufford hunting country, and the consumption there during the hunting months of bread and cheese, sherry and beer, must have been immense. <b>Everyone</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be intimate with him, and all called for what they wanted as if they were on their own premises. On such occasions as these Larry was a proud man; for no one in those parts carried a lighter heart or was more fond of popularity.|$|E

Of course there was a certain amount of society of a sort, and everyone called, and one had to go out to dinner-parties. But such dinner-parties! Why, a dinner in India was worth a score of them. Most of them were very stiff and formal, and after the women had gone upstairs, the men talked of nothing but hunting and shooting and crops and cattle; so at last I could stand it no longer, but threw up six months of my furlough and went out again. Yes, of course I had Jane, but at that time she was but fourteen, and was a girl at school; and when I talked of bringing her home and having a governess, <b>everyone</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> {{think that it would be}} the worst thing possible for her, and no doubt they were right, for the life would have been as dull for her as it was for me.|$|E
