25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{imperfections}} in the new South Africa where I would have hoped that things would be better, but on balance I think we have basically achieved what we set out to achieve. And if I were to draw balance sheets on where South Africa stands now, I would say that the positive outweighs the negative by far. There is a tendency by commentators across the world to focus on the few negatives which are quite negative, like <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> handling AIDS, like our role vis-à-vis Zimbabwe. But the positives – the stability in South Africa, the adherence to well-balanced economic policies, fighting inflation, doing all the right things in order to lay the basis and the foundation for sustained economic growth – are in place.|$|E
500|$|Originally set for {{a single}} {{theatrical}} release, the idea to split the book into two parts was suggested by executive producer Lionel Wigram due to what David Heyman called [...] "creative imperative". Heyman initially responded negatively to the idea, but Wigram asked, “No, David. <b>How</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> going to do it?”. After rereading the book and discussing it with screenwriter Steve Kloves, he agreed with the division.|$|E
500|$|After {{he saw the}} {{completed}} episode, James L. Brooks called the writers and suggested that the Kamp Krusty script {{be used as a}} plotline for a film. However, the episode ran very short, and to make it barely fit the minimum time the Kamp Krusty song had to be lengthened by a number of verses. The episode was also chosen to be the first episode of the season, further complicating matters. As Jean told Brooks, [...] "First of all, if we make it into the movie then we don't have a premiere, and second, if we can't make 18 minutes out of this episode <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> supposed to make 80?" ...|$|E

500|$|... "A Streetcar Named Marge" [...] and [...] "Kamp Krusty" [...] were holdovers {{from the}} {{previous}} season and so were {{the last of the}} Klasky Csupo produced episodes to air. Brooks suggested that the script for [...] "Kamp Krusty" [...] be expanded and produced as a feature-length theatrically released film. However, the episode ran very short, barely reaching the minimum length allowed, with the episode's musical number having to be lengthened by a number of verses. The episode had also been selected to be the season's premiere. As Jean told Brooks, [...] "First of all, if we make it into the movie then we don't have a premiere, and second if we can't make 18 minutes out of this episode <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> supposed to make 80?" ...|$|E
500|$|Trevor Noah also avoided talking {{too much}} about Fox News, as Stewart was {{previously}} known for. [...] "The Daily Show {{was based on an}} emerging 24 hour news cycle, that’s everything it was, that’s what inspired The Daily Show. Now you look at news and it’s changed. It’s no longer predicated around 24 hour news. There are so many different choices. Half of it is online now. Now you’ve got the 'Gawker's, the 'Buzzfeed's. The way people are drawing their news is soundbites and headlines and click-bait links has changed everything. The biggest challenge {{is going to be an}} exciting one I'm sure is <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> going to bring all of that together looking at it from a bigger lens as opposed to just going after one source — which was historically Fox News" [...] Noah said at a press conference before the shows debut.|$|E
500|$|Ó Corrain {{also offers}} {{argument}} against the identification of Ímar and Ingvar/Ivar: [...] "To take but one example, if Ivarr of Dublin is identical with Inguar, <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> to give any credence to Smyth's reconstruction of Brompton (p. 229) which shows Ivarr in East Anglia in 871 when we know from contemporary Irish sources that Ivarr of Dublin was besieging Dumbarton for four months in 870 and returned to Ireland in early 871 with the takings?... Taken all together, the genuine material on Inguar in contemporary English sources is slight". He also states [...] "there is nothing new in the suggestion that Ímar of Dublin and Igwar/Ingwar/Iuuar of English history are identical. It has frequently been put forward....and has equally frequently been rejected or treated as a mere possibility". Downham concludes [...] "while medieval writers {{seem to have been}} as interested as modern historians about Ívarr’s origins, it is perhaps wiser to accept that {{we do not know what}} these really were".|$|E

500|$|The {{script for}} [...] "Twilight" [...] {{was written by}} Mike Sussman, one of the {{co-producers}} on Enterprise. The producers had considered showing the episode {{later on in the}} series in order to show what could have happened if the Xindi were successful in their attack on Earth, but instead elected to show it earlier in the series to demonstrate the stakes in the storyline during season three. [...] "Twilight" [...] was directed by Robert Duncan McNeill, his third directing credit for the series following [...] "" [...] and [...] "". McNeill had previously starred in [...] as Tom Paris. McNeill was interviewed for the magazine Star Trek Monthly shortly after reading the script for [...] "Twilight" [...] for the first time. He explained that after reading it, he said [...] "Holy crap <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> going to do that?" [...] He explained that the episode would see the Enterprise destroyed but wasn't yet sure how they were going to film certain sequences such as the roof being blown off the bridge and the crew being sucked out into space.|$|E
500|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in The Guardian, Steve Jones, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, gave his perspective on the Kaycee Nicole case. Jones credits the anonymity of the Internet for impeding people's abilities to realize when someone is lying: [...] "Given the mutability of identity, <b>how</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> to negotiate social relations that, at least in the realm of face-to-face communication, were fixed by recognition of identity?" [...] Online interaction has only been possible since the 1980s, steadily growing over the years. After analyzing several cases of online deception and interaction, social theorists Adam Joinson and Beth Dietz-Uhler write in a 2002 Social Science Computer Review article that deception on the Internet is a paradox: the faceless nature of online communications not only gives opportunity to the unscrupulous and attention-seekers, but also allows earnest users to express themselves more freely, representing a truer version of themselves. Typically, Internet deception takes the form of changing one's sex or presenting one's own idealized image of oneself. Joinson and Dietz-Uhler cite a chapter in Network and Netplay, in which researchers note the purpose of some forums is to allow their members to participate in a kind of online party, affording chances to pretend and perform: [...] "the type of play on the Internet is usually allowed only in children or adults during masked balls or carnivals". More practical issues such as age, location, marital status, and occupation are also frequently changed online, or left ambiguous to preserve users' privacy or continue identity play.|$|E

Quebec sovereigntist leaders were granted a prominent role in the conference and used their floor time to denounce Canadian federalism to an international audience to the great annoyance of their federalist host. But Dion's views got a big boost during the closing speech by United States President Bill Clinton. Clinton appeared to echo the Supreme Court Reference, warning that [...] "when a people thinks it should be independent {{in order to have a}} meaningful political existence, serious questions should be asked.... Are minority rights as well as majority rights respected? <b>How</b> <b>are</b> <b>we</b> going to co-operate with our neighbours?". Clinton argued that federalism allows peoples seeking recognition of their identity a way to do so without isolating themselves in a nation-state.
