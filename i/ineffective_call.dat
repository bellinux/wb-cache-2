40|$|Female {{copulation}} {{calls are}} mating-associated vocalizations {{that occur in}} some species of Old World monkeys and apes. We argue that copulation calls have two immediate functions: to encourage mating attempts by other males and to increase mate guarding by the consort male. We hypothesize that female copulation calls have evolved under the selective pressures of risk of infanticide and sperm competition. When male mate guarding is effective, copulation calls allow females to concentrate paternity in dominant males and benefit from their protection against the risk of infanticide. When mate guarding is <b>ineffective,</b> copulation <b>calls</b> may bring genetic benefits to females through facilitation of sperm competition. We present a quantitative model in which interspecific variation in females' promiscuity predicts their tendency to use copulation calls in conjunction with mating. The model predicts that in species with little female promiscuity, copulation calls should be rare and exhibited only in association with mating with dominant males. In species in which females are highly promiscuous, copulation calls should be frequent and unrelated to male dominance rank. The limited data available to test the model support its main predictions {{as well as the}} predicted relation between copulation calls and male dominance rank...|$|R

This article describes the GP's self-perception as it emerged in 20 semi-structured interviews that explored the GP's perspective on their own prescribing. Data collection and analysis was largely inspired by grounded theory. The GPs described a constantly active process in which they prescribed, experienced an emotional reaction to their prescribing, evaluated themselves, redefined themselves for the better or worse, defined the new prescribing situation, prescribed and so forth. The GPs felt disappointed with themselves when their prescribing conflicted with their human or scientific ideals, and when they did not live up to their image of themselves, as GPs and as persons. They experienced discomfort when they were exposed to pressure as well as when they gave in to it. These negative emotions demanded a redefinition of the GPs' selves. The GPs applied both preventive and coping strategies to protect themselves from redefining themselves negatively. They strived to live up to their ideals, lowered their ideals, convinced themselves of the appropriateness of their prescribing and sought inspiration and self-development. This study demonstrates that self-perception is fundamental to how GPs prescribe medicines. Future interventions in quality development that aim to improve GPs' prescribing practices should therefore include considerations of the GPs' self-perception and facilitate autonomous self-development.

We go on to characterize small sheaves and gerbes. We show that ineffective data of étale stacks is completely described by the theory of small gerbes. Furthermore, it is shown that étale stacks (and in particular orbifolds) induce a small gerbe over their effective part, and all gerbes arise in this way.

40|$|In 2009, the University of Chicago Urban Education Institute (UEI) and the Ounce of Prevention Fund (the Ounce) {{embarked}} on an effort to form a partnership whose vision is to " [...] . build a model of public education for {{children and their families}} that begins at birth and creates success in school, and life. " UEI designed and operates four public charter school campuses offering families a pathway to college for their children that begins with prekindergarten (preK) and continues through high school. The Ounce created and operates the Educare School, which prepares at risk children from birth to age five for success in school. The partnership will initially demonstrate what it means when children begin their education early with Educare, enter UEI's charter campuses for elementary, middle and high school, advance to college, and persist to graduation. Ultimately, the partnership plans to harness and share the academic expertise and real-world experience of members of both organizations. The goal is to collaboratively and continuously align and create instructional practices, and academic and social supports, to demonstrate a new model of public education that seamlessly and successfully prepares children for college, beginning at birth. In the United States, early childhood education (ECE) is not publicly mandated. All children in the U. S. receive public schooling that generally begins with kindergarten. As a result, many children {{do not have access to}} sufficient learning opportunities early in life, and may start kindergarten at a disadvantage. Given that K- 12 attempts at closing the achievement gap are costly and generally <b>ineffective,</b> <b>calls</b> are being made to prevent the achievement gap from ever occurring. This requires intervention at a very young age, since differences in achievement based on income level can be seen as young as nine months and become larger by kindergarten. Even children who have been exposed to high quality ECE can experience a "fade" of those benefits upon entering K- 12, depending on the quality of elementary school. For many children, the achievement gap begins to widen once again. In the city of Chicago, high school graduation rates hover around 50 percent. Of those students who graduate, only 35 percent go on to attend four-year colleges and universities. The numbers grow even smaller for children who are African American, Latino, or low-income. The achievement gap that opens in early childhood tends to widen throughout K- 12, and many children who start with a disadvantage at kindergarten never graduate from high school. If they do, they are unlikely to attend and graduate from college. Higher education levels are related to higher incomes, lower levels of unemployment, and other positive outcomes. In order to be competitive in a world where a college degree is increasingly important, the United States must ensure that children graduate high school and are prepared to graduate from college. Preventing an achievement gap and ensuring that the fade of benefits from high-quality ECE does not occur in elementary school, while at the same time raising the bar to "college for all," requires collaboration between the worlds of ECE and K- 12. In the United States, however, there exists a structural divide between the two fields. Despite the fact that they share similar goals for educating children, policies, standards, and funding streams contribute to a "disconnect. " The partnership's goals are to effect change in public education by creating a demonstration model of birth-to-grade 12 education that prepares students for success in college and life. In order to accomplish this, the two organizations will work together to share expertise, and align and co-create practices, to ensure the best possible chance for success for students. The partnership first needed to be established, strengthened, and trusted by key players from each organization [...] this was not a simple task. UEI and the Ounce began this effort by developing a roadmap that includes a shared vision and mission, core values, and goals and activities of the partnership. We focus here on the formation of the shared vision and mission, a document that represents the goals and aspirations of the partnership between the two organizations. In the service of creating this document, a working group comprised of educators, administrators, researchers, and teacher leaders from each organization was formed. The working group used an iterative process, where they revised, questioned, and adjusted the roadmap during a series of ten three-hour meetings that took place over the course of nine months and were facilitated by a specialist. Working group members' testimonies about their experiences participating in the group are referenced in this study.

The King Reports, {{as well as}} {{legislative}} developments culminating {{from these}} reports, are aimed at enhancing corporate governance standards in South Africa and aligning them with international best practice. Notwithstanding these measures, {{a number of significant}} failures in corporate governance rocked South African business during this period, severely denting the perception of the quality and standard of corporate governance. Given the importance of international investors' confidence, a continuous review of the South African corporate governance structure is imperative. This dissertation aims at performing a comparative and critical analysis of the corporate governance structures in South Africa. The objective is to seek alternative or improved corporate governance mechanisms that will enhance the current dispensation. For this purpose, various international corporate governance models are analysed and their monitoring mechanisms identified. The possibility of utilising some of these mechanisms to enhance corporate governance in South Africa is examined. The institutional environment in South Africa (I. e. the controlled shareholder environment, inactive and illiquid markets) prevents the market model mechanisms of the US and UK from playing a greater monitoring role. Further market model mechanisms aimed at promoting the independent monitoring of management have to a large extent been incorporated into the South African corporate governance framework. However, the ongoing failures of large listed and unlisted companies, including smaller banks in South Africa, that appear to indicate poor levels of, or <b>ineffective,</b> corporate governance, <b>calls</b> for the enforcement and acceptance of the monitoring guidelines set out in the King Reports.

40|$|The rise of {{resistance}} {{together with the}} shortage of new broad-spectrum antibiotics underlines the urgency of optimizing the use of available drugs to minimize disease burden. Theoretical studies suggest that coordinating empirical usage of antibiotics in a hospital ward can contain the spread {{of resistance}}. However, theoretical and clinical studies came to different conclusions regarding the usefulness of rotating first-line therapy (cycling). Here, we performed a quantitative pathogen-specific meta-analysis of clinical studies comparing cycling to standard practice. We searched PubMed and Google Scholar and identified 46 clinical studies addressing the effect of cycling on nosocomial infections, of which 11 met our selection criteria. We employed a method for multivariate meta-analysis using incidence rates as endpoints and find that cycling reduced the incidence rate/ 1000 patient days of both total infections by 4. 95 [9. 43 - 0. 48] and resistant infections by 7. 2 [14. 00 - 0. 44]. This positive effect was observed in most pathogens despite a large variance between individual species. Our findings remain robust in uni- and multivariate metaregressions. We used theoretical models that reflect various infections and hospital settings to compare cycling to random assignment to different drugs (mixing). We make the realistic assumption that therapy is changed when first line treatment is <b>ineffective,</b> which we <b>call</b> "adjustable cycling/mixing". In concordance with earlier theoretical studies, we find that in strict regimens, cycling is detrimental. However, in adjustable regimens single resistance is suppressed and cycling is successful in most settings. Both a meta-regression and our theoretical model indicate that "adjustable cycling" is especially useful to suppress emergence of multiple resistance. While our model predicts that cycling periods of one month perform well, we expect that too long cycling periods are detrimental. Our results suggest that "adjustable cycling" suppresses multiple resistance and warrants further investigations that allow comparing various diseases and hospital settings. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Summary In {{the early}} 17 th century, an {{important}} {{debate in the}} Reformed Church in the Dutch Republic was that between the Reformed and the Remonstrants. The national synod of Dort resolved this debate with {{a rejection of the}} Remonstrants’ ideas. In this discussion, one of the main issues was the relationship between election by God and the free will of men. To explain why not everybody who receives God’s call – in the Gospel or through nature – responds to it by believing in Christ and repentance, the Canons of Dort distinguished between the external preaching of the Gospel and the internal illumination by God. Those who only receive the external Word, are not able to believe the Gospel due to their sinfull nature. On the other hand, the combination of the preaching and the internal illumination and act of God results in true belief in God. 	This difference between internal illumination or internal calling and the external preaching or the external call is the topic of this thesis. To understand the difference between the external and internal calling correctly from a 21 st century viewpoint, we need to know what theologians in the 17 th century considered to be internal calling and external calling and how they saw the relationship between those two. This is even more interesting, as we realize that the distinction between internal and external {{is at the center of}} the Cartesian philosophy of subjectivity, the philosophy that became influential in the late 17 th century. Therefore, this thesis aims to answer the question: what is meant by external and internal and how do these terms relate in the Reformed theology in the 17 th century? 	In this thesis, the investigation is focused on one key representative of the late 17 th century theology – the period in which the Cartesian influence became important. This representative is Petrus van Mastricht, a Reformed theologian with a fairly moderate position in the Reformed church, who however was involved in a lively debate with Cartesians. The main question of this thesis is divided in four subquestions: 1. 	What is the historical context of Petrus van Mastricht, in particular related to the Cartesian debate? 2. 	How does Van Mastricht describe internal and external calling and their relationship? 3. 	How does Van Mastrichts description relate to his key sources for this terminology? 4. 	Could an effect of the Cartesianism on Van Mastricht be established, with regard to his description of internal and external calling? 	With regard to Van Mastricht, the investigation focuses on his main dogmatic work, the Theoretico-practica theologia and also his main polemic book against the Cartesians, the Novitatum cartesianum gangraena, is included. As four important sources of the Theoretico-practica theologia, the following works are taken into account: the Summa theologiae of Thomas Aquinas (1225 ? – 1274), the Leiden Synopsis purioris theologiae (1625), the Medulla of William Ames (1576 - 1633) and the Disputationes selectae of Gisbertus Voetius (1589 - 1676). Besides that, I also compare Van Mastricht with a contemporary and key Reformed theologian, Francis Turretin (1623 - 1687). Question 1 : Historical context of Petrus van Mastricht Van Mastricht was a theologian with a good international education and reputation. He became professor in theology, first in Germany and later in Utrecht, where he was the successor of Voetius. As a representative of the Reformed tradition, he was fairly moderate, but also fiercely debating with Cartesian theologians. In this respect, Van Mastricht’s Gangraena was one of the main writings against the Cartesians in this period. Question 2 : The relationship between external and internal calling Van Mastricht defines external calling as the call that is received by the external senses, the sense of hearing and the intellect. The internal call is received by the soul, which Van Mastricht distinguishes from intellect and will. External and internal calling have the same message and cause, only the way through which they operate is different. In fact, it is only one call, with an internal and an external component. According to Van Mastricht, calling as such does not result in faith. Calling as such is just a moral cause, which recommends somebody what would be good, but is not a cause sufficient for faith. Here, an internal, physical cause is needed: the internal renewal of the heart by the regeneration. This regeneration changes the will, and causes that the intellect and will become faithful. In this respect, the regeneration is needed before someone can actually respond in faith to the God’s call. Question 3 : Van Mastricht’s relationship to his sources Van Mastricht’s theology of calling is in line with mainstream Medieval and Reformed theology, which also asserts that internal and external calling cooperate, but that an internal act of God is needed for faith. Van Mastricht’s position is in particular aligned with those of Aquinas, Voetius and Polyander (1568 - 1646). Aquinas actually uses the same subdivisions in his terminology as Van Mastricht, although he grants the will a somewhat more important role. In comparison with Polyander, Van Mastricht has a somewhat different distinction between calling and regeneration. One of the Leiden Synopsis authors, Polyander, considers the internal act of God still to be part of calling, while Van Mastricht defines that a regeneration. Nevertheless, the distinction between internal and external calling (including a part of regeneration for Van Mastricht) is fairly similar. On the other hand, Rivetus (1572 - 1651) uses in the same Synopsis a more pronounced distinction between external and internal calling. For Rivetus, the difference between external and internal calling is perfectly in line with respectively <b>ineffective</b> and effective <b>calling.</b> Ames has the same opinion: only the elect receive the internal, effective calling. This position differs from Van Mastricht, who states the internal and external usually cooperate and that also those who do not receive faith can have received the inward call. Question 4 : Cartesian influence The comparison with his sources and also with Turretin shows that Van Mastricht’s description of external an internal calling is not unique, but rather in line with an important stream in Reformed thought. On the other hand, there could be a – rather small – Cartesian influence, as Van Mastricht does elaborate on the specific internal human ‘faculties’ in more detail than Turretin or any of his sources (as far as considered in this study). In this respect, in particular the difference with Turretin is striking, as Turretin does not like to talk about internal human ‘faculties’ in relationship to the external calling, as he reserves any real internal effect of calling for the elect only. Moreover, Van Mastricht considers the soul as perceptive, which seems to be a Cartesian opinion, while Turrettini does explicitly argue that the soul cannot be perceptive. As Van Mastricht deals in his Gangraena specifically with these ‘faculties’ in his debate with Cartesians, it could be that this debate has urged him to be more precise. This could be an indication of Cartesian influence on his thinking about internal and external calling. This study on the subject of internal and external calling in the 17 th century Reformed theology shows that the distinction between internal and external has not always the same meaning. Therefore, we have to be careful in interpreting these terms. In this respect, interpreting internal calling as effective calling and external <b>calling</b> as <b>ineffective</b> is not a correct interpretation of this distinction. This interpretation is valid for some theologians, such as Turretin and Ames, but not for others, such as Van Mastricht and Voetius...|$|R
