40|$|This paper {{examined}} {{the impact of}} the board of commissioners on voluntary disclosures provided by listed firmsin Indonesia for the period of year 2004 to 2010. The board of commissioners were characterized by boardcomposition, board size, board role and board intensity. Voluntary disclosure was proximate by an aggregateddisclosure score of non-mandatory, non-financial and financial information. The results indicated that boardsize, board intensity (number of board meetings), or board role (number of audit committe members) was significantlyand positively related to the extent of voluntary disclosure as predicted by the agency theory, while boardcomposition (number of insiders) was significantly and negatively related to the extent of voluntary disclosure aspredicted by <b>the</b> <b>stewardship</b> <b>theory.</b> <b>The</b> result showed that independent board members did not conduct theirmonitoring function on management effectively. Alternatively, insiders were involved in operating firm’s activities.

40|$|Literature {{in family}} {{business}} perpetuity and sustainability {{is well documented}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> advanced economies, {{but there is a}} scarcity of insights from emerging markets where this research relates. Further, while the academic discourse has concentrated on issues of succession and corporate social responsibilities, very little discourse have dwelt on issues of sustainability of the family business; and whereas evidence from literature indicates that the survival rate in family businesses is very low. The evidence of a small percentage of family owned businesses being sustained into their third generation highlights the seeming inherent difficulty in achieving sustainability by most family businesses. Hence there is scarcity of empirical data on the constructs determining the sustainability of family business; and evidence of the low survival rate of family businesses, this thesis, therefore, investigated, and gave an understanding and interpretation of how family business owners can develop the capabilities to survive across generations using <b>the</b> <b>stewardship</b> <b>theory</b> paradigm and relying on evidence from an emerging market economy. A qualitative method with 41 in-depth face-to-face interviews involving owners and managers of family-owned micro, small and medium sized businesses was used. The data were analysed using the thematic analysis procedure {{with the aid of a}} Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software (CAQDAS). Findings from this thesis contribute to the theoretical literature on stewardship and family business. One of the key findings indicated that, family structure and family internal dynamics have a greater challenge in sustainability. This is the consequence of polygamy, which is well practiced in Nigeria, and in many African countries. It was also found that the element of spirituality arising <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ideals and values of the owning family is a factor for achieving family wellbeing and business sustainability. In the realm of <b>the</b> <b>stewardship</b> <b>theory</b> as <b>the</b> guiding theory for this thesis, it was further found that <b>the</b> <b>stewardship</b> of managers and indeed other non-family member employees within the business is provisional stewardship as non-family members rely on other incentives <b>from</b> <b>the</b> owning family members to behave as stewards. Based on the findings, and building on <b>the</b> <b>stewardship</b> <b>theory,</b> <b>the</b> thesis came up with nine propositions on the constructs determining family business sustainability and developed a model of sustainability for the micro, small, and medium sized family businesses...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – Drawing on family-{{business}} {{and business}} model (BM) literature {{the purpose of}} this paper is to explore whether a relationship exists between the family involvement in the management (i. e. closed or mixed management) and BM choice.

Findings – The analysis surprisingly reveals that no relationship exists between the BM ideal type chosen and the type of management composition. Rather, it seems that the choice of hiring non-family managers is dictated by the willingness to reinforce the BM chosen by the owner and that the role played by non-family managers is not revolutionary but reinforces the owner’s BM choice.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the perceptions of}} directors in Australian public listed companies about their access to information for their role as directors. We focus on information costs and information asymmetry. Directors' perceptions {{of the relationship between}} the composition of Boards, the perceived roles of Boards and the information requirements to fulfil those roles were explored in interviews with 45 directors from public listed companies. Implicit in Agency Theory is the assumption that independent directors have free access to the information required to fulfil their role in monitoring and control. We found, however, demonstrable evidence of information asymmetry. The central finding was that directors perceive that the CEO and Executive have the controlling power over information. The provision of appropriate information for Board decisions is perceived to hinge on the "integrity" of the CEO and Executive. This emphasis on integrity and "good companies" does appear consistent with <b>the</b> <b>Stewardship</b> <b>Theory</b> of governance. It raises as a question for future research the possible alternative relationships between Boards and management.

40|$|ABSTRACT Does CEO duality – the {{practice}} of one person serving both as a firm’s CEO and board chair – contribute to or inhibit firm performance? Agency theory suggests that CEO duality is bad for performance because it compromises the monitoring and control of <b>the</b> CEO. <b>Stewardship</b> <b>theory,</b> in contrast, argues that CEO duality may be good for performance due to the unity of command it presents. The empirical evidence, largely from developed economies, is largely inconclusive. This article joins the debate by extending empirical work to the largely unexplored context of institutional transitions. Our findings, based on an archival database covering 403 publicly listed firms and 1, 202 company-years in China, offer stronger support for <b>stewardship</b> <b>theory</b> and relatively little support for agency theory.
