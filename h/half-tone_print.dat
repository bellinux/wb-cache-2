40|$|PVC and PET-G (Glycol {{modified}} polyethylene terephthalate) {{have the}} highest consumption in the shrink sleeve market due to its high shrink abilities and cost effectiveness. The reproductions of fine tone details on these films are challenging as the occurrence of graininess and image-noise results in print defect such as <b>print</b> <b>half-tone</b> mottle. The presence of <b>print</b> <b>half-tone</b> mottle is visually disturbing leading to wastage of ink, substrate and time. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the effect of gravure process parameters viz. ink viscosity, press speed, impression hardness and line screen and develop statistical model for <b>print</b> <b>half-tone</b> mottle in shrink films. The base line for <b>print</b> <b>half-tone</b> mottle was determined by conducting production runs on press with a defined set of process parameters and the target was set to minimize it from the baseline. The half-tone area was scanned and processed through SFDA algorithm to calculate <b>print</b> <b>half-tone</b> mottle. The design of experiments (DOE) was generated for above-mentioned process parameters and was analysed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) to find the significant factor affecting the <b>print</b> <b>half-tone</b> mottle. The analysis revealed line screen, viscosity and hardness as significant factors in minimizing <b>print</b> <b>half-tone</b> mottle. The results showed minimization of <b>print</b> <b>half-tone</b> mottle by 28 % for both PVC and PET-G films. Furthermore, regression model was developed and validated for <b>print</b> <b>half-tone</b> mottle and a correlation coefficient (R 2) of 0. 8696 and 0. 879 was achieved for PET-G and PVC respectively. The proposed model is helpful in determining the impact of gravure process parameters and prediction of <b>print</b> <b>half-tone</b> mottle in shrink films...|$|R

50|$|The G7 {{method was}} created by Don Hutcheson, {{chairman}} of the IDEAlliance GRACoL (International Digital Enterprise Alliance, General Requirements for Applications in Commercial Offset Lithography) in 2006. It was created {{to solve the problem}} of computer to plate (CtP) printing systems and other devices printing images with different tonal value increases (TVIs), or dot gains. Also, professionals in the printing industry follow the International Organization for Standardization’s (ISO) principles of <b>half-tone</b> <b>printing,</b> called ISO 12647-2, which does not specify colorimetric values for gray balance and refers to multiple TVI curves. This results in an ambiguous definition of the print’s final ‘appearance’.|$|R
50|$|Le Blon’s method {{required}} {{experience in}} deconstructing a colored image into its presumed primary chromatic components {{and understanding the}} effects of superimposing printing inks in certain areas, for which extensive trial and error work was required. Le Blon’s process was practiced in France after his death and progressed in the early-mid-19th century into chromolithography. What was required, however, is a methodology to break images objectively into color components which became possible with the invention of color photography {{in the second half}} of the 19th century and the invention of <b>half-tone</b> <b>printing</b> in the late 19th century.|$|R
50|$|The {{half-tone}} method {{he invented}} {{was to use}} a glass screen with fine lines in it which translated the gradations of an image when placed between a light-sensitive metal plate and a negative. The final image created was a metal picture made of black dots surrounded by white. It is {{said that he was}} fired from that job by Herald publisher James Gordon Bennett, Jr., who described the idea as idiotic. Horgan then went over to the rival Daily Graphic which debuted <b>half-tone</b> <b>printing</b> with the first printed photograph of an image of Steinway Hall in Manhattan published on December 2, 1873.|$|R

In tracing this history from origins in <b>half-tone</b> <b>printing,</b> the authors argue that qualities available to analogue photographers are no longer available to digital, and that these changes correspond to historical developments in the wider political and economic world.

5000|$|Newspapers and {{magazines}} were first able to reproduce photographs instead of line drawings in the mid-1880s with {{the invention of}} the <b>half-tone</b> <b>printing</b> press.

This allowed the photograph and others like it to be commercially viable. In an effort to save the cost of hiring photographers for commission-based photo shoots, publishers and advertisers began to consider stock photos as a less risky alternative.

40|$|International audienceWe {{introduce}} a so-called " mean-path-defined Yule–Nielsen " (MPD-YN) model for predicting {{the color of}} <b>half-tone</b> <b>prints</b> in reflectance or transmittance modes, inspired by the Yule–Nielsen modified spectral Neugebauer model, where the empirical n value is replaced with a spectral parameter different for each halftone, directly calculated thanks to a closed-form formula, {{a function of the}} measured spectral reflectances (or accordingly trans-mittances) of full-tone calibration patches and the surface coverages of the Neugebauer primaries in the halftone. This parameter is based on the average number of internal reflections undergone by light between two half layers of the print, whose expression derives from a flux transfer model between the two half layers. According to the tests carried out in this study with paper printed in inkjet, the predictive performances of the MPD-YN model are rather good and very close to those obtained with the Yule–Nielsen model...|$|R

40|$|Using a finer {{screen ruling}} {{will result in}} an {{improved}} final image quality in the color printing process. Studies have shown that beyond certain screen frequencies any further {{increase in the number}} of lines per inch has negligible benefit on multicolor process printing when using the <b>half-tone</b> <b>printing</b> precess.

The final image quality was subjectively evaluated based on the appearance of otherwise identical reproductions with the only difference being the screen ruling.

40|$|In {{the ceramic}} {{industry}} half-tone images are often generated {{from a small}} number of separations with the result that inks are printed over each other to achieve the final print.

A set of 800 binary ink mixtures and 100 single-ink mixtures were used to test the model and it was found that best performance (median CIELAB ∆E of 2. 73 units) was possible using a high value of the Yule-Nielsen correction factor (n = 20). A Kubelka-Munk model was developed to predict the reflectance factors of the overlap regions in the prints (where one ink dot lies over another). Color differences using the Kubelka-Munk model ranged from 1. 8 to 10. 4. However, when the measured overlap reflectance spectra were replaced by the Kubelka-Munk predictions in the Neugebauer model the median color difference increased from 2. 73 to 3. 40 CIELAB units...|$|R
