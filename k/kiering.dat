She married the artist Petrus <b>Kiers</b> and became the aunt of van Cecil (van) Haanen. She was the mother of George Lourens <b>Kiers</b> and Catharina Isabella <b>Kiers,</b> both of whom also became artists. From 1838 she wase an honorary member of the Royal academy of art in Amsterdam (Koninklijke Academie voor Beeldende Kunsten). She is known for her genre paintings, but was also a papercut artist who cut more than a hundred portraits of artists around 1837.|$|R

40|$|The Album Amicorum of Klaas Willem <b>Kiers</b> (c. 1722 / 1759), {{military}} {{engineer and}} model {{maker of the}} Dutch Stadtholder Willem IV This paper focuses {{on the importance of}} the Album Amicorum as a source of biographical information. Presented is the case of Klaas Willem <b>Kiers,</b> an engineer from Groningen, who was employed by the Dutch Stadtholder Willem IV for the fabrication of scientific models for his cabinet of experimental philosophy in The Hague. <b>Kiers</b> also taught the young hereditary prince – the later Willem V – the basic principles of fortification. After the sudden death of the stadholder, <b>Kiers</b> served as a lieutenant- engineer in the Army of the Dutch Republic. At that time he started an Album Amicorum, in which he collected inscriptions from various prominent countrymen. Kiers’ case demonstrates how this source can provide precious information about one’s biography. We can, among others, reconstruct Kiers’ education, his connections at the Stadholderly court and the other social levels in which he operated. <b>Kiers</b> probably used some of these connections to start in 1758 a chemical factory in Amsterdam for the production of soap and saltpetre. In short, Kiers’ album provides a unique testimony of the Dutch scientific culture in the mid- 1750 s. </p...|$|R

After Silliman’s results confirmed that the petroleum in the Oil Creek Valley could profitably be distilled into lamp oil, Bissell founded the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company. The company was funded by businessmen and bankers from New Haven, Connecticut. Among the stockholders was banker James Townsend.|$|R
40|$|For many least-squares {{decomposition}} models efficient algorithms {{are well}} known. A more difficult problem arises in decomposition models where each residual is weighted by a nonnegative value. A special case is {{principal components analysis}} with missing data. <b>Kiers</b> (1997) discusses an algorithm for minimizing weighted decomposition models by iterative majorization. In this paper, we for computing a solution. We will show that the algorithm by <b>Kiers</b> is a special case of our algorithm. Here, we will apply weighted majorization to weighted principal components analysis, robust Procrustes analysis, and logistic bi-additive models of which the two parameter logistic model in item response theory is a special case. Simulation studies show that weighted majorization is generally faster than the method by <b>Kiers</b> by a factor one to four and obtains the same or better quality solutions. For logistic bi-additive models, we propose a new iterative majorization algorithm called logistic majorization...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe flux {{distributions}} on {{the device}} {{in the solar}} reactor with the solar furnace were studied. This study aims to understand of characters of concentrated sun rays through <b>KIER</b> solar furnace and design of device shape for uniform heat distribution on the device surface. For the calculation of heat flux on the device with the <b>KIER</b> solar furnace, the optical modeling program Soltrace was used. At first, the <b>KIER</b> 45 kWth solar furnace and flat disk type device shape was simulated for understand of past experimental results. And then 3 cylinder shape device model and 1 conical shape device model was suggested and the heat flux intensity on the device was calculated. Finally, 5 models which is including flat disk type device shape, 3 cylinder shape, and 1 conical shape device models was calculated and compared. The {{results show that the}} concentrated sun rays from dish and heat flux intensity are has a directional characteristic concentrated to normal direction than perpendicular direction. The results will be applied to next solar demonstrations which are design of new solar reactor and new device shape...|$|R

40|$|The {{two most}} common {{component}} methods {{for the analysis}} of three-way data, CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) and Tucker 3 analysis, are used to summarize a three-mode three-way data set by means of a number of component matrices, and, in case of Tucker 3, a core array, Until recently, no procedures for computing confidence intervals for the results from such analyses were available. Recently, such procedures have come available by Riu and Bro (2003) for CP using the jack-knife procedure, and by <b>Kiers</b> (2004) for CP and Tucker 3 analysis using the bootstrap procedure. The present paper reviews the latter procedures, discusses their performance as reported by <b>Kiers</b> (2004), and illustrates them on an example data set...|$|R

50|$|Thus, Captain Jan embarks on his {{independent}} career, at {{the head}} of a faithful crew - a very little struggling David facing the implacable hostility of the Kwel Goliath. He has the luck to save an American millionaire's yacht in the Caribbean, getting a considerable sum in salvage. This enables him to buy a solid though old tugboat from Mr. <b>Kiers</b> of Tserling Island. This also gets Jan increasingly involved with Rikki <b>Kiers,</b> the daughter of the man who sold him the ship - a young woman who had grown up on the sea. In fact, she is as good a ship-handler as Jan himself, but in the early Twentieth Century Dutch society, there is no way for a woman to have a nautical career.|$|R

50|$|Kohnen and <b>Kiers</b> {{initially}} {{formed the}} group, often abbreviated as TKDE, {{as a project}} for scoring silent movies such as Nosferatu and Metropolis. Kohnen and <b>Kiers</b> knew each other from studying at the Utrecht School of Arts. The hitherto electronic project was altered in 2004 when British trombonist Jeffery and Swiss cellist Hitz joined. As a quartet, the group released their debut album. Since then, the group has added Cegarra and Bosman in 2006, and Anderson in 2008. Since 2007, {{all members of the}} group reside in the Netherlands. The group formed the Mount Fuji Doomjazz Corporation in 2007 as an improvisational side project. The group released their crowd-funded From the Stairwell in 2011. In 2014, the group unofficially split up. Jason Kohnen confirmed this on his new project's Facebook page.|$|R
