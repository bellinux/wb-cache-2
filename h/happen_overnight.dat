50|$|The cathedral is an {{architectural}} marvel, {{but it is}} not something which <b>happened</b> <b>overnight.</b> Different architectural styles have been adopted during successive restoration and reconstruction work. As a result, the cathedral has a mixture of different architecture. Italian Marble from Genoa has been used in designing the pulpit and the font used for baby baptisms. The marble pulpit was created out by M/s Snaize & Co., and Bishop Tubbs of Palayamkottai was the first to preach on the marble pulpit on 1 July 1928, delivering the sermon 'The reunion of Christendom'. The Brass lectern (eagle with spread wings on the globe) was presented by some planters of Mysore in 1903, in memory of Harry Alexander Campbell and Montague Beaden Follett of Lumsden's Horse Regiment who died in the Boer Conflicts of South Africa. The bible on the lectern was presented by Mrs. Laura Amelia Amaller.|$|R

50|$|At about 8 pm on Sunday, December 21, 1975, WALL {{suffered}} a fire which gutted its North Street studios, killing several residents in a third-floor apartment, and forcing {{the station to}} move to an abandoned, block-long Armory building in Middletown.
