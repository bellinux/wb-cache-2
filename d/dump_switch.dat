40|$|The D 0 solenoid {{was shown}} to be {{completely}} safe when deliberately quenched without a protection resistor in factory trials at Toshiba. In the tests the power supply was turned off shortly after {{the onset of the}} quenches. In this note an examination is made of the consequences to be expected if the power supply fails to turn off after the onset of a quench. The quite extreme assumption of simultaneous failure of the magnet power supply to switch off and the <b>dump</b> <b>switch</b> to open {{in the event of a}} magnet quench is seen to be completely harmless to the magnet...|$|E
40|$|Each {{of the two}} LHC {{injection}} kicker magnet systems must {{produce a}} kick of 1. 3 T. m with a flattop duration variable up to 7. 86 µs, and rise and fall times of less than 900 ns and 3 µs, respectively. A kicker magnet system consists of four 5 Ω transmission line magnets with matched terminating resistors, four 5 Ω Pulse Forming Networks (PFNs) and two Resonant Charging Power Supplies (RCPSs). Six RCPSs and nine PFNs, together with associated switch tanks and <b>dump</b> <b>switch</b> terminating resistors, have been built at TRIUMF and all have been tested at up to 60 kV PFN voltage {{to ensure that the}} performance is within specification. This paper describes the HV measurements, compares these results with low voltage measurements and analyses the pulse performance of the PFNs. The measurements are compared with results from PSpice simulations...|$|E
40|$|Tests {{have been}} carried out on a string {{prototype}} superconducting magnets, consisting of one double-quadrupole and two double-dipoles forming the major part of a half-cell of the LHC machine. The magnets are protected individually by ``cold diodes`` and quench heaters. The electrical aspects of these tests are described here. The performance during quench of the protection diodes and the associated interconnections was studied. Tests determined the magnet quench performance in training and at different ramp-rates, and investigated the inter-magnet propagation of quenches. Current lead and inter-magnet contact resistances were controlled and the performance of the power converter and the <b>dump</b> <b>switches</b> assessed...|$|R

40|$|The superconducting magnets of the LHC are {{protected}} by heaters and cold by-pass diodes. If a magnet quenches, the heaters on this magnet are fired and the magnet chain is de-excited in about two minu tes by opening <b>dump</b> <b>switches</b> in parallel to a resistor. During the time required for the discharge, adjacent magnets might quench due to thermo-hydraulic propagation in the helium bath and/or heat con duction via the bus bar. The number of quenching magnets depends on the mechanisms for the propagation. In this paper we report on quench propagation experiments from a dipole magnet to an adjacent ma gnet. The mechanism for the propagation is hot helium gas expelled from the first quenching magnet. The propagation changes with the pressure opening settings of the quench relief valves...|$|R
40|$|The {{installation}} {{and testing of}} a series connection of superconducting magnets (three 10 m long dipoles and one 3 m long quadrupole) has been a necessary step in the verification of {{the viability of the}} Large Hadron Collider at CERN. In the LHC machine, if one of the lattice dipoles or quadrupoles quenches, the current will be by-passed through cold diodes and the whole magnet chain will be de-excited by opening <b>dump</b> <b>switches.</b> In such a scenario {{it is very important to}} know whether the quench propagates from the initially quenching magnet to adjacent ones. A series of experiments have been performed with the LHC Test String powered at different current levels and at different de-excitation rates in order to understand possible mechanisms for such a propagation, and the time delays involved. Results of the tests and implications regarding the LHC machine operation are described in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The {{energy stored}} {{in all the}} LHC dipoles, about 11 GJ, can {{potentially}} cause severe damage to the magnets, bus bars and current leads.

This paper describes the cooling process of the resistors and explains the choice process for the main components of the cooling equipment...|$|R
40|$|The NCV 8881 {{consists}} of a Buck switching regulator (SMPS) with a combination SMPS output undervoltage monitor and CPU watchdog circuit. In addition, two fixed−voltage low dropout regulator outputs are provided, and share an LDO output voltage status output. Once enabled, regulator operation continues until the Watchdog signal is no longer present. The NCV 8881 is intended for Automotive, battery−connected applications that must withstand a 40 V load <b>dump.</b> The <b>switching</b> regulator is capable of converting the typical 9 V to 19 V automotive input voltage range to outputs from 3. 3 V to 8 V at a constant switching frequency, which can be resistor programmed or synchronized to an external clock signal.

50|$|Remote reading gauges, such as used by weather stations, work {{similarly}} to rain gauges. They {{have a large}} catch area (such as a drum sawn in half, top to bottom) which collects snow until a given weight is collected. When this critical weight is reached, it tips and empties the snow catch. This <b>dumping</b> trips a <b>switch,</b> sending a signal. The collection then repeats. If the catch container has a heater in it, it measures the snow weight accurately. It is also possible to tip based on volume instead of weight, with appropriate fill sensing.|$|R
40|$|A fast {{extraction}} kicker {{system has}} been installed in the SPS and successfully used in extraction tests in 2003. It will serve to send beam to the anticlockwise LHC ring and the CNGS neutrino facility. The magnets and pulse generators have been recuperated from an earlier installation and upgraded to fit the present application. Hardware improvements include diode stacks as replacement of the previous <b>dump</b> thyratron <b>switches,</b> a cooling system of the magnets, sensors for its ferrite temperatures and magnetic field quality assessment. In preparation of the future use for 450 GeV/c transfer to LHC and double batch extraction at 400 GeV/c for CNGS the tests comprised extractions of single bunches, twelve bunches in a single extraction and single bunches in a double extraction. The measured kick characteristics of the upgraded system are presented, along {{with a discussion of}} Pspice simulation results. Further improvements will be discussed which are intended to make the system comply with the specifications for CNGS...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the question of}} an optical unit designing for transmitting power laser radiation through an optical fiber. The aim of this work is designing a simple construction unit with minimized reflection losses. The source of radiation in the optical unit described below is an ultraviolet laser with diode pumping. We present the general functioning scheme and designing features for the three main parts: laser beam deflecting system, laser beam dump and optical unit control system. The described laser beam deflection system is composed of a moving flat mirror and a spherical scattering mirror. Comparative analysis of the production technology for such mirrors was carried out, and, as a result, {{the decision was made}} to produce both mirrors of 99. 99 % pure molybdenum without coating. A moving mirror deflects laser emission from a source through a fiber or deflects it on a spherical mirror and into the laser beam <b>dump,</b> moreover, <b>switching</b> from one position to another occurs almost immediately. It is shown that a scattering mirror is necessary, otherwise, the absorbing surface of the beam dump is being worn out irregularly. The laser beam dump is an open conical cavity, in which the conical element with its spire turned to the emission source is placed. Special microgeometry of the internal surface of the beam dump is suggested for the better absorption effect. An optical unit control system consists of a laser beam deflection system, laser temperature sensor, deflection system solenoid temperature sensor, and deflection mirror position sensor. The signal processing algorithm for signals coming from the sensors to the controller is described. The optical unit will be used in special technological equipment...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{nonlinear}} {{frequency conversion}} technique based on intracavity stimulated Raman scattering in solid-state media is discussed. Devices {{have been built}} {{which are based on}} this technique. Standard first-order resonator eigenmode routines as well as paraxial diffraction-propagation, laser gain and nonlinear conversion routines have been integrated into a generalized laser resonator design software package which can accurately model the growth and evolution of the transverse field distribution in arbitrary intra- or extra-cavity nonlinear frequency converted laser sources. This package has been implemented as a design tool and has been utilized to model intracavity Raman beam cleanup. The macroscopic and microscopic pulse dynamics are modeled by rate equation and roundtrip pulse intensity iterator routines, respectively. A host of dynamical features are predicted theoretically and confirmed by experiment; such as, nonlinear cavity <b>dumping,</b> gain <b>switching,</b> dynamical chaos, and self-mode-locking. A new theory based on probabilistic arguments is developed to describe the spectral properties of intracavity Raman lasers. It is shown that under normal conditions, the Raman gain profile which results from multimode pumping is inhomogeneously broadened. Questions of efficiency, cavity matching, injection seeding and locking are addressed. Phase-matching and conversion efficiency in optically active second-order nonlinear materials is treated theoretically. Also examined are the conditions under which optical activity significantly alters the nonlinear optical properties of a material and show how this mechanism might be used in designing a nonlinear optical device. Corrections to the standard theoretical expressions for birefringent phase-matching angles and conversion efficiency are obtained for application to biaxial crystals with large natural birefringence. A generalized quasi-phase-matching scheme based on optical activity is formulated for three-wave interactions in second-order nonlinear crystals. A technique based on optical parametric generation and amplification is utilized to accurately determine the dispersion of the nonlinear susceptibilities in thin-film samples. Intrinsic pump-energy instabilities are taken into account in the data analysis...|$|R
40|$|Banda Aceh, Indonesia, {{populated}} with 250. 000 inhabitants, produces 180 tons of waste daily. But only 165 tons are delivered to its 21 ha area of municipal landfill facility, the Gampong Jawa Landfill (GJL). Since 2009, GJL stopped the open <b>dumping</b> practice and <b>switched</b> to sanitary landfill system. However, landfill gas (LFG) generated is still naturally venting {{out into the}} atmosphere. For leachate treatment, GJL has an anaerobic, an aerobic, and a maturation pool. There is also an advanced biogas reactor, namely the Intermediate Treatment Facility (ITF), which has 40 kW electricity generating capacity. Two Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) systems also available, functioned to process human excrements with total capacity of 130 cubic meter. This research is conducted to study the potential electricity generation from all-combined available resources in GJL. It includes potentials from landfills, ITF, and WWTPs. Literature review, in-depth interviews, field survey, and spread-sheet simulation are methods that have been conducted to achieve the objectives. The result shows that GJL could benefit more than sufficient electricity for its own operations, and transmit the rest to the National Power Grid. Furthermore, all potential is then monetized by utilizing the new Indonesian Feed-in Tarif (FiT) regulations. And the Certified Emision Reductions (CERs) {{is also expected to}} be traded through Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).

40|$|Superconducting {{switches}} {{may find}} application in superconducting magnet systems that require energy extraction. Such superconducting switches could be bypass-switches that are operated {{in conjunction with}} a parallel resistor or dump-switches where all of the energy is dissipated in the switch itself. Bypass-switches are more suited to higher energy circuits as a portion of the energy can be dissipated in the external <b>dump</b> resistor. Dump- <b>switches</b> require less material and triggering energy as a lower switch resistance is needed to achieve the required total dump resistance. Both superconducting bypass-switches and superconducting dump-switches can be ther- mally activated. Switching times that are comparable to those obtained with mechanical bypass-switch systems can be achieved using a co-wound heater that is powered by a ca- pacitor discharge. Switches that have fast thermal diffusion times through the insulation can be modelled as a lumped system whereas those with slow thermal diffusion times were modelled with the full heat diffusion equation. Superconducting switches can be formed of either high temperature superconductors (HTS) or low temperature superconductors (LTS). Switches based on HTS materials allow operation at higher temperatures where the cost of cooling is less. Extracting the magnet energy and depositing the heater energy at higher temperatures will also reduce the load on the overall cryogen ic system during switching and energy extraction. For magnet circuits that are based on high temperature superconductors the switch must also be formed of HTS material. Due to the approximately T^ 3 dependence of specific heat capacity, switches that operate at higher temperatures have slower heat diffusion times and require higher triggering energies than those operating at low temperature. HTS based dump-switches and HTS based bypass-switches were tested in liquid nitrogen to show that the required switching time could be achieved at these high temperatures. The design and optimisation of superconducting switches that were formed of various superconducting materials were performed for example magnet circuits to provide reference designs of switches. These example circuits were based on selected Large Hadron Collider 600 A circuits that had a stored energy of 5. 5 kJ. Superconducting switches may also find application in magnet circuits with higher transport currents and higher energies. The scaling and suitability of the reference designs to higher energy circuits was also described...|$|R
