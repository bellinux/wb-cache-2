40|$|AbstractLet φ(x) = x 3 + ex 2 + ƒx + g be an {{irreducible}} polynomial {{with three}} real roots. Let Mλ be the cubic order Z[λ] where φ(λ) = 0. Many techniques in computational number theory {{depend on a}} knowledge of <b>fundamental</b> <b>units</b> for the orders being studied. When these <b>fundamental</b> <b>units</b> are of a form that is consistent throughout an entire family of orders, the techniques can often be applied {{to all of the}} orders at once. This paper provides a technique for determining <b>fundamental</b> systems of <b>units</b> in families of cubic orders of the form Mλ. The main theorem yields <b>fundamental</b> systems of <b>units</b> {{for a wide range of}} cubic orders with only a small number of restrictions.

5|$|Cell theory {{states that}} the cell is the <b>fundamental</b> <b>unit</b> of life, that all living things are {{composed}} {{of one or more}} cells, and that all cells arise from other cells through cell division. In multicellular organisms, every cell in the organism's body derives ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg. The cell is also considered to be the basic unit in many pathological processes. In addition, the phenomenon of energy flow occurs in cells in processes {{that are part of the}} function known as metabolism. Finally, cells contain hereditary information (DNA), which is passed from cell to cell during cell division. Research into the origin of life, abiogenesis, amounts to an attempt to discover the origin of the first cells.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reform}} period, the Communist regime in China {{regulated}} birth control. The government shaped policies {{with the intention}} to develop population science “through selective absorption of Western science and technology.” In 1979, the Planned Birth Policy was implemented. The Chinese government only allowed one child per Han family, with more children allowed to non-Han families. Since this planned birth policy was implemented based on local laws rather than on a national population law, the level of birth restriction differed in urban and rural areas. In families reliant on farming for income, the household is the <b>fundamental</b> <b>unit</b> of production, so many rural families would rather pay the hefty fines for excess birth.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} {{approach}} of GWA studies is the case-control setup, which compares two {{large groups of}} individuals, one healthy control group and one case group affected by a disease. All individuals in each group are genotyped {{for the majority of}} common known SNPs. The exact number of SNPs depends on the genotyping technology, but are typically one million or more. For each of these SNPs it is then investigated if the allele frequency is significantly altered between the case and the control group. In such setups, the <b>fundamental</b> <b>unit</b> for reporting effect sizes is the odds ratio. The odds ratio is the ratio of two odds, which in the context of GWA studies are the odds of disease for individuals having a specific allele and the odds of disease for individuals who do not have that same allele. When the allele frequency in the case group is much higher than in the control group, the odds ratio is higher than 1, and vice versa for lower allele frequency. Additionally, a P-value for the significance of the odds ratio is typically calculated using a simple chi-squared test. Finding odds ratios that are significantly different from 1 is the objective of the GWA study because this shows that a SNP is associated with disease.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the modern}} medical era, the main means for {{studying}} the internal structures of the body were dissection {{of the dead and}} inspection, palpation and auscultation of the living. It was the advent of microscopy that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues. Technical advances in the development of achromatic lenses increased the resolving power of the microscope and around 1839, Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann identified that cells were the <b>fundamental</b> <b>unit</b> of organization of all living things. Study of small structures involved passing light through them and the microtome was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine. Staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue. Advances in the fields of histology and cytology began in the late 19th century along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of biopsy specimens. The invention of the electron microscope brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the ultrastructure of cells and the organelles and other structures within them. About the same time, in the 1950s, the use of X-ray diffraction {{for studying the}} crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of molecular anatomy.|$|E

In 1901, Giorgi proposed to the [...] (AEI) that the MKS system (which used the metre, kilogram and second as its <b>fundamental</b> <b>units)</b> should be extended with a fourth unit to be chosen from the units of electromagnetism, solving also the presence of the irrational coefficients.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{imaginary}} quadratic fields {{such that the}} Iwasawa λ 2 -invariant equals 1, obtaining information on zeros of 2 -adic L-functions and relating this to congruences for <b>fundamental</b> <b>units</b> and class numbers. This paper explores the interplay between zeros of 2 -adic L-functions and congruences for <b>fundamental</b> <b>units</b> and class numbers of quadratic fields. An underlying motivation was to study the distribution of zeros of 2 -adic L-functions, the basic philosophy being that {{the location of the}} zeros causes restrictions on the 2 -adic behavior of the class numbers and <b>fundamental</b> <b>units</b> of real quadratic fields. Though the predicted restrictions involved the unit and class number together, numerical computations (we used PARI) revealed definite patterns for the unit and class number separately, which we were then able to prove. Several of these congruences are classical, but some of them seem to be new. We use the information obtained to study the distribution of the zeros, in particular their distances from 1 and 0. In a previous paper [14], one of us showed that, if (2 p + 1) / 3 is prime infinitely often, then it is possible to have zeros of 2 -adic Lfunction...|$|R
