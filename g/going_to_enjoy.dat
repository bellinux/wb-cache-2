25|$|Martin Vanderhof: Referred to {{mostly as}} Grandpa in the play. Father-in-law to Paul, father of Penny, {{grandfather}} of Alice and Essie. He is an eccentric happy {{old man who}} has never paid his income tax because he doesn't believe in it, as he feels that the government wouldn't {{know what to do}} with the money if he paid it. Once a very successful businessman, he left his job 35 years prior for no reason other than to just relax. He lives his life by the philosophy 'don't do anything that you're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> doing'. He goes to circuses, commencements, throws darts, and collects stamps.|$|E
500|$|Noel Murray from The A.V. Club graded {{the finale}} with a B+; he praised the writers [...] "for once again {{introducing}} {{a new world}} that feels fully formed, with its own rich backstory that they could choose to explore {{if they have the}} time and the inclination." [...] Murray concluded his review, [...] "It may be that Fringe has bitten off more than it can chew here, and the storytelling is about to get hopelessly convoluted, as it often does once time-travel enters the picture. But for now, I’m <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> living with and thinking over what I’ve seen so far. And I’m going to trust that no matter how crazy Fringes fourth season gets, the writers are going to keep bringing everything back to less mind-bending questions". Some reviewers questioned the logic of Peter having never existed, though others expressed their trust in the writers' ability to make it work.|$|E
500|$|The Wizarding World of Harry Potter {{was well}} {{received}} by Harry Potter fans. Matt Blum of Wired stated [...] "every detail is finely crafted {{to enhance the}} experience". An Orlando Sentinel article stated [...] "muggles will love their Harry Potter adventure" [...] but identifies {{the need for the}} park to offer Universal Express Passes due to large crowds. It also stated Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey is a truly one-of-a-kind experience that cannot easily be described. Lisa Minot, from The Sun, stated [...] "after a sneak peek, I can say it is the most faithful recreation of JK Rowling's books and movies ever seen. Fans will be in heaven." [...] Leigh Caldwell from Traveling Mamas noted that although The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is ideal for the whole family, it's not designed for anyone under 3 years old." [...] She went on to consolidate others' comments about the area: [...] "there is no doubt that fans of the Harry Potter books and movies are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> the heck out of a visit to the Wizarding World". Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, criticized the fact that the park was chosen to be in Orlando, rather than in London, stating that it was [...] "utterly mad" [...] to leave it to the Americans [...] "to make money from a great British invention." ...|$|E

500|$|The Day the Earth Stood Still: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was orchestrated and {{conducted}} by Timothy Williams. Tyler Bates {{was brought in}} to compose the score for The Day the Earth Stood Still after Derrickson heard his work on The Devil's Rejects and Slither. Instead of imitating the original score by Bernard Herrmann, Bates decided to try to convey the updated message of the new film, and he assumed that most people would not even realize it was a remake. Bates said, [...] "People revere an original property and feel that it's sacred, but frankly, there's a good story to be retold, as it applies to the climate of the world now. If that's something beyond the scope of a person's ability to take in, on a new level, without necessarily using the original as a criteria for whether or not they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> it, then they probably shouldn't bother themselves with it." [...] The origins for the sound on the new score came from Bates attending the filming of a few scenes with Reeves and Smith. When he got back to L.A., he created a sound loop on his GuitarViol to which Derrickson responded, [...] "I think that's the score!", when it was played for him. Bates utilized the theremin, which Herrmann heavily used for the original film's score. Bates and the theremin player he hired used the instrument in a manner reminiscent of a sound effect, especially during Klaatu's surgery. A short segment from Bach's Goldberg Variations is heard playing in the background of the Professor's home when Klaatu visits the Professor which {{was not included in the}} film's accompanying soundtrack release.|$|E

[...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> it and {{hopefully}} this won't {{be the last one}} I get to enjoy. Todd was in a tough situation. He made some plays. But in the playoffs, for a rookie to get the job done...it is very, very difficult." ...|$|E
2500|$|Discussing {{how he and}} his sibling {{decide which}} {{projects}} to work on, Mike Chapman said, [...] "We learned how to politely say no to things that were going to affect our lives negatively. If it’s going to be fun, if we’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> doing it, and if the end project is going to be something we want to have happen, we say yes." ...|$|E

2500|$|IGN's Dan Adams {{scored the}} PC version 6.8 out of 10, writing [...] "solid {{shooting}} mechanics mix with poor level design while potentially interesting protagonists are bludgeoned with ho-hum enemies. Sadly {{some of the}} game's signature features, such as the slow-motion focus shooting, are hugely overused and actually drag the game down." [...] He praised Ray's levels but criticized Billy's, especially {{the implementation of the}} whip, and concluded [...] "There are some fun and frantic moments here [...] but overall the level design is a linear letdown." [...] Jonathan Miller scored the Xbox 360 version 7.5 out of 10. He too much preferred Ray's levels, but wrote [...] "Western fans are really <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> Call of Juarez, a game not afraid to take chances and have fun with itself." [...] He praised the atmosphere, soundtrack, and variety of gameplay styles, concluding [...] "while Call of Juarez isn't particularly great in any [...] area, you have to hand it to Techland for developing one of the most fun Westerns to date." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{announced}} on April 8, 2009 Khan would {{move up to}} the light welterweight division to fight Andreas Kotelnik (31-2-1, 13 KOs) at the MEN Arena in Manchester for the WBA light welterweight title on 18 July. Khan Said, [...] "This is the best news that I could have received. To fight for the world title in only my 22nd fight and at the age of just 22 is fantastic. Frank has done a great job getting the world title fight for me in Britain and now I have to go out win it." [...] This would be Kotelnik's fourth title defense. Khan won by a unanimous decision, 120–108, 118–111, 118–111, in front of 10,000, and became the third-youngest Brit to win a world title, at the age of 22. Khan's lightning hand speed and fitness gave him the advantages to go well ahead on points in the first ten rounds. Kotelnik rallied in the closing rounds but could not land a decisive punch on Khan, Kotelnik throwing everything he had in the final two stanzas. After the fight, Khan said, [...] "It's the best feeling ever. I want to thank Freddie Roach and my team for making this happen. I'm a world champion and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> it. I'm still young and I've got big things to come." ...|$|E
2500|$|James Leach of Your Sinclair {{gave the}} ZX Spectrum game a 92/100 rating, writing that [...] "I'm really into this game. As far as I can see, it's got {{everything}} it should have. It's fast, it's easy in places and dead wicked in others and it's got a {{massive amount of}} variety. What more could you want? ... The graphics are very cartoony, as you'd expect, and there's pots of colour." [...] Leach {{also noted that the}} idea of including minigames in Bart vs. the Space Mutants [...] "is pretty inspired, and makes the game even more fun." [...] A reviewer for Crash also gave the ZX Spectrum version a positive review, with a 91/100 rating. He praised the variety and gameplay of the game, and noted that [...] "while it may sound pretty basic [...] it’s when you start discovering things, making use of objects, finding hidden treasures that it really comes alive. And achieving an objective is satisfying because the route to completion can be pretty tough (especially some of the platform elements)." [...] The reviewer also noted that [...] "if you’re a Simpsons fan the game’s incredibly appealing, the graphics all reflect Matt Groening’s cartoon very well. And how much of a fan you are dictates how much you’re really <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> this [...] Non-fans can still get loads of entertainment, but some parts may be frustrating if you’re not into the characters." ...|$|E

France also recovered from the defeat at Waterloo quickly to retake its position on the world stage.|$|R
5000|$|The Te Deum and Jubilate, {{along with}} another {{composition}} As Pants the Hart, earned Handel a yearly income from Queen Anne's Court. Donald Burrows writes in [...] "Handel and the English Chapel Royal" [...] that [...] "his close association with the Court, reinforced by his musical contribution to events that were personal to the royal family, gave him both the benefits and the disadvantages of identification with the Hanoverian establishment." [...] However, at the time his annual pension was granted {{it would not have}} been obvious that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> the favour of the future George I, who was in fact opposed to the Treaty of Utrecht.|$|R
5000|$|Publisher James Thomas Fields {{pushed for}} Hawthorne to {{complete}} the project quickly. Fields had begun reissuing the author's earlier series for children titled Grandfather's Child, originally published by Elizabeth Palmer Peabody and now renamed True Stories from History and Biography, and was also planning a new edition of Twice-Told Tales. The entirety of the collection was written between June and mid-July 1851. He sent the final manuscript to Fields on July 15 and wrote: [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> begin <b>to</b> <b>enjoy</b> the summer now and to read foolish novels, if I can get any, and smoke cigars and think of nothing at all — which is equivalent to thinking of all manner of things." ...|$|R
