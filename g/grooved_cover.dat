40|$|The films {{composed}} of carbon nanowalls and diamond nanoplatelets, respectively, can be simultaneously formed on graphite substrate by controlling the hydrogen etching rate during microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition. To modulate the etching rate, {{two kinds of}} substrate design were used: a bare graphite plate and a graphite <b>groove</b> <b>covered</b> with a single crystal diamond sheet. After deposition at 1200 degrees C for 3 hours, we find that dense diamond nanoplatelets were grown on the bare graphite, whereas carbon nanowalls were formed on the grooved surface, indicating that not only reaction temperature but also etching behavior is a key factor for nanostructure formation...|$|R

50|$|Cogs were a type {{of round}} ship, {{characterized}} by a flush-laid flat bottom at midships but gradually shifted to overlapped strakes near the posts. They had full lapstrake planking covering the sides, generally starting from the bilge strakes, and double-clenched iron nails for plank fastenings. The keel, or keelplank, was only slightly thicker than the adjacent garboards and had no rabbet. Both stem and stern posts were straight and rather long, and connected to the keelplank through intermediate pieces called hooks. The lower plank hoods terminated in rabbets in the hooks and posts, but upper hoods were nailed to the exterior faces of the posts. Caulking was generally tarred moss that was inserted into curved <b>grooves,</b> <b>covered</b> with wooden laths, and secured by metal staples called sintels. Finally, the cog-built structure could not be completed without a stern-mounted hanging central rudder, which was a unique northern development. Cogs used to have open hulls and could be rowed short distances. In the 13th century they received decks.|$|R
40|$|Post-translational {{modification}} of protein serines/threonines with N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is dynamic, inducible and abundant, regulating many cellular processes by interfering with protein phosphorylation. O-GlcNAcylation is regulated by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase, both encoded by single, essential, genes in metazoan genomes. It is not understood how OGT recognises its sugar nucleotide donor and performs O-GlcNAc transfer onto proteins/peptides, {{and how the}} enzyme recognises specific cellular protein substrates. Here, we show, by X-ray crystallography and mutagenesis, that OGT adopts the (metal-independent) GT-B fold and binds a UDP-GlcNAc analogue {{at the bottom of}} a highly conserved putative peptide-binding <b>groove,</b> <b>covered</b> by a mobile loop. Strikingly, the tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) tightly interact with the active site to form a continuous 120 Å putative interaction surface, whereas the previously predicted phosphatidylinositide-binding site locates to the opposite end of the catalytic domain. On the basis of the structure, we identify truncation/point mutants of the TPRs that have differential effects on activity towards proteins/peptides, giving first insights into how OGT may recognise its substrates...|$|R

5000|$|... (Original {{description}} by W.H. Dall) The {{height of}} the shell attains 3.5 mm, its diameter also 3.5 mm. The small, white, solid shell is shaped much like Littorina littorea (Linnaeus, 1758), having 4½ whorls and a minute glassy rounded nucleus. The radiating sculpture consists of fine incremental striae and occasional irregularities of growth. The spiral sculpture consists of two sorts. First, the fine spiral <b>grooving</b> <b>covers</b> the whole shell evenly and is always present. Secondly, there are strong spiral ridges, generally nine or ten on the body whorl, but sometimes smaller and more numerous, sometimes partly absent, sometimes so arranged as to tabulate {{the part of the}} whorl next the suture, and almost invariably smaller and weaker as they approach the base and the centre of the base. The suture is distinct, not channelled. The simple aperture is nearly circular, but the outer margin of its thickened edge is angulated at the junction with the body. The callus is continuous. The columella is arched, with a small chink, but no umbilicus behind it. This chink varies in size with different specimens. The aperture is oblique, its upper margin a little depressed. This shell sometimes has the raised riblets reddish brown against the waxen white of the rest.|$|R

40|$|The Intense Pulsed Neutron Source (IPNS) at Argonne National Laboratory is a {{spallation}} neutron source dedicated to materials research. Its three cryogenic methane moderators provide twelve neutron beams to fourteen neutron scattering instruments and test facilities. The moderators at IPNS are of cryogenic methane (CH{sub 4 }); one of liquid methane at 100 K, {{and two of}} solid methane at 30 K. These moderators produce intense beams of both cold and thermal neutrons. The moderators are each of a different physical configuration in order to tailor their performance for the instruments and facilities that operate on the neutron beams. As part of the ongoing operation of IPNS, {{as well as new}} enhancements to the target, moderator, and reflector systems, we have performed experiments characterizing the energy and time distribution of neutrons in the various beams. These measurements provide absolutely normalized energy spectra using foil activation techniques joined with time-of-flight measurements, and energy-dependent time distributions using a time-focused crystal analyzer. The IPNS accelerator system delivers 14 {micro}A of 450 MeV protons, in 100 ns pulses at 30 Hz, to a target composed of water-cooled depleted uranium disks. The solid methane ''H'' moderator is 100 by 100 by 45 mm in size, centerline poisoned with 0. 25 mg/mm{sup 2 } gadolinium, and decoupled from the graphite reflector with 0. 5 mm of cadmium. The liquid methane ''F'' moderator, which is viewed from both faces, is also 100 by 100 by 45 mm in size, gadolinium poisoned 16 mm below each of the two viewed surfaces, and decoupled from the graphite reflector with cadmium. The solid methane ''C'' moderator has a re-entrant ''grooved'' geometry. The moderator is 100 by 100 by 80 mm overall, with 40 mm deep 12 mm wide horizontal grooves in the viewed surface.

40|$|Style shape, and pollen {{presenter}} morphology and anatomy, {{are similar}} in Banksia L. f. and Dryandra R. Br. There are four style shapes straight, bowed, s-shaped and hooked. However, in Dryandra, s-shaped and hooked styles are uncommon. The stigma in all cases is contained within the pollen presenter, but there is variation in {{the location of the}} stigmatic groove on the presenter, from truly apical (terminal), obliquely terminal to rarely located {{at the base of the}} presenter as in B. ericifolia. There is also variation in whether the pollen is deposited over the stigmatic groove in bud or the slit is free of pollen at anthesis. In Banksia, 73 % of species studied have the <b>groove</b> <b>covered</b> with pollen, while in Dryandra, a somewhat lower proportion of species (50 %) has this configuration. Pollen cohesion on the presenter varies from sticky to loose but is mostly slightly sticky. Similar pollen presenter forms occur in both genera, bul in Dryandra, the generally less elaborate shapes are more frequent than is the case in Banksia. Anatomically, the pollen presenters are quite complex, with several cell layers concentrically disposed around the central transmitting tissue. There is considerable variation in the epidermal cells of the presenters between species. In most, the cells are small and thick-walled, but in B. ilicifolia, they are very thin-walled and enlarged into elongated projections. Similar forms occur in other species. In B. tricuspis, the epidermal cells are enlarged, regularly rounded in shape and become smaller and thick-walled near the stigmatic groove. Underlying the epidermis, polyphenol-containing cells and sclerenchyma vary in proportion between species and also in their location within the presenter. The variation in wall characteristics of epidermal cells and the proportion of sclerenchyma in different species is likely to be related to maximising pollination success within an environment containing a variety of pollinator behaviours. Although vertebrates are important in pollinating many species, invertebrates are likely to be the primary pollinators of a significant number of the other species in both genera...|$|R

40|$|Micromachining {{technology}} is very attractive for integrated antennas as it offers efficient packaging, high radiation efficiency, wide impedance bandwidth, and less mutual coupling between antenna elements. These advantages {{are more difficult}} to be achieved using the conventional planar technology especially at high frequencies such as 77 GHz. Research carried out on MEMS antennas can be classified into two main categories. The first category features a flat antenna, such as patch, realized on a thin membrane [1]. The membrane is fabricated by etching silicon under the patch. This results in reducing the effective dielectric constant of the medium surrounding the antenna and consequently increases the bandwidth and radiation efficiency. The second category features a 3 D antenna, such as horn or waveguide, realized by etching grooves in a number of silicon wafers [2]. The walls of these <b>grooves</b> are <b>covered</b> with metal.
