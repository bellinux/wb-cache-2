5|$|Sea otters {{have the}} {{thickest}} <b>fur</b> of any mammal. Their beautiful <b>fur</b> is a main target for many hunters. Archaeological {{evidence indicates that}} for thousands of years, indigenous peoples have hunted sea otters for food and <b>fur.</b> Large-scale hunting, part of the Maritime <b>Fur</b> Trade, which would eventually kill approximately one million sea otters, began in the 18th century when hunters and traders began to arrive {{from all over the}} world to meet foreign demand for otter pelts, which were one of the world's most valuable types of <b>fur.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sea otters {{spend much}} of their time grooming, which {{consists}} of cleaning the <b>fur,</b> untangling knots, removing loose <b>fur,</b> rubbing the <b>fur</b> to squeeze out water and introduce air, and blowing air into the <b>fur.</b> To casual observers, it appears as if the animals are scratching, but they are not known to have lice or other parasites in the <b>fur.</b> When eating, sea otters roll in the water frequently, apparently to wash food scraps from their <b>fur.</b>|$|E
5|$|Adding to Sulley's lifelike {{appearance}} was an intense {{effort by the}} technical team to refine the rendering of <b>fur.</b> Other production houses had tackled realistic <b>fur,</b> most notably Rhythm & Hues in its 1993 polar bear commercials for Coca-Cola and in its talking animals' faces in the 1995 film Babe. This film, however, required <b>fur</b> on a far larger scale. From the standpoint of Pixar's engineers, the quest for <b>fur</b> posed several significant challenges; one was {{to figure out how}} to animate a large numbers of hairs — 2,320,413 of them on Sulley — in a reasonably efficient way, and another was to make sure that the hairs would cast shadows on other ones. Without self-shadowing, either <b>fur</b> or hair takes on an unrealistic flat-colored look (e.g., in Toy Story, the hair on Andy's toddler sister, as seen in that movie's opening sequence, is hair without self-shadowing).|$|E

5|$|Birth {{usually takes}} place in the water and {{typically}} produces a single pup weighing 1.4 to 2.3kg (3 to 5lb). Twins occur in 2% of births; however, usually only one pup survives. At birth, the eyes are open, ten teeth are visible, and the pup has a thick coat of baby <b>fur.</b> Mothers have been observed to lick and fluff a newborn for hours; after grooming, the pup's <b>fur</b> retains so much air, the pup floats like a cork and cannot dive. The fluffy baby <b>fur</b> is replaced by adult <b>fur</b> after about 13 weeks.|$|E
40|$|In wall systems, airspaces can {{increase}} thermal resistance if a reflective material such as foil with low emissivity is {{installed in a}} Furred-Airspace Assembly (FAA). In this paper, the present model, hygIRC-C, was used to investigate the steady-state thermal resistance of wall assemblies that incorporate foil adhered to expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam in a furred-assembly. To investigate {{the effect of the}} <b>furring</b> orientation, the <b>furring</b> was installed horizontally and vertically and compared to walls with no <b>furring.</b> For wall with vertical <b>furring,</b> the 3 D version of the present model was used to capture the 3 D effect of the thermal bridges. Because the foil emissivity can be affected by dust accumulation and/or water vapor condensation on the foil surface, consideration was given to investigate the effect of both varying foil emissivity and outdoor temperature on the thermal performance of the various wall specimens. Results showed that the thermal resistance (R-value) of the reference wall (no <b>furring)</b> is greater than the wall specimens with <b>furring.</b> Also, results showed that the contribution of the FAA to the R-value of wall specimen with vertical <b>furring</b> is higher than that for wall specimen with horizontal <b>furring.</b> Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|In wall systems, airspaces can {{contribute}} in obtaining a higher thermal resistance, if a reflective material such as foil with low emissivity is installed {{on one side}} or the other of a Furred-Airspace Assembly. In this paper, the present model, hygIRC-C, was used to investigate the steady-state thermal performance of wall specimens that incorporate foil bonded to expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam in a furred-assembly having airspace next to the foil. In order to investigate the effect of the <b>furring</b> orientation on the wall thermal performance, the <b>furring</b> was installed horizontally and/or vertically. Also, a reference wall similar to these walls but with no <b>furring</b> was considered. For the reference wall and wall with horizontal <b>furring,</b> the 2 D version of the present model is suitable to model these wall assemblies. However, for wall with vertical <b>furring,</b> the 3 D version of the present model was used in order to capture the 3 D effect of the thermal bridges due to the vertical <b>furring</b> on the energy transport and momentum transport in the wall system. Consideration was given to investigate the effect the foil emissivity and outdoor temperature on the contribution of the FAA on the thermal performance of the wall systems.

The Okanogan River was used by <b>fur</b> brigades traveling between Fort Okanogan and Kamloops. In the late 1850s this route became known as the Okanagan Trail and was widely used as an inland route to the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush.|$|E
5|$|In {{another of}} her studies, Morgan worked with a fox breeder to {{study the effects of}} diets that {{contained}} low and normal amounts of B vitamins. The experimental group (the vitamin-restricted foxes) developed a fine, sparse gray coat that resembled the fashionable <b>fur</b> of the silver fox. Morgan found that the foxes with normal intake of B vitamins had shiny black <b>fur.</b> After the experiments, a <b>fur</b> stole was made out of <b>fur</b> from both the experimental and control groups. Morgan wore the stole on at least two important occasions – her presentation of the study data in 1939 and her Garvan Medal award ceremony ten years later.|$|E

5000|$|In construction, <b>furring</b> (<b>furring</b> strips) {{are thin}} strips of wood or other {{material}} to level or raise surfaces of another material to prevent dampness, to make space for insulation, or to level and resurface ceilings or walls. <b>Furring</b> {{refers to the}} process of installing the strips and to the strips themselves. [...] "Firring" [...] is a U.K. term for wood strips which are usually 50 mm wide, tapered and fixed above wood roof joists to provide drainage falls below roof boarding. <b>Furring</b> strips themselves are typically referred to as [...] "battens" [...] in the U.K. and sometimes the material is called [...] "strapping" [...] in the U.S.|$|R

5|$|It is a small, mouse-like rodent. It {{differs from}} the very similar eastern voalavo mainly in some measurements, such as a greater tail length. It also resembles small species of Eliurus, but the <b>fur</b> is darker {{and there is no}} tail tuft. The <b>fur</b> is soft, short, and thick, and appears dark gray on most of the upperparts, but more {{brownish}} on the sides. On the back, the cover hairs, which form {{the main part of the}} <b>fur,</b> are three-colored: most of the hair is gray, followed by a narrow light buff band and a black tip. The longer guard hairs are black. The <b>fur</b> of the underparts is not different in overall color, but the individual hairs are gray for about three quarters of their length and white at the tips, except for those at the chin, which are white throughout.|$|E

50|$|The heraldic <b>furs</b> (ermine, vair) do {{not need}} a special {{hatching}} method, as they have a special pattern that is easily recognizable even on the uncoloured illustrations. Nevertheless, there existed two heraldic <b>furs</b> that had their own hatchings. Also, there are in use (mainly in the Czech heraldic literature) <b>furs</b> like zibeline and marten. The colour and hatching for zibeline {{is the same as}} the sable (black) tincture, and the colour and hatching of marten is identical with the gules (red) tincture. So, in some countries these tinctures are also held as <b>furs</b> (mainly in the Czech heraldic traditions, but not in real use, and sometimes also in the German heraldry, which is also not in real use today).|$|R
5|$|More goods became {{available}} in St. Louis during the economic recovery, {{largely as a}} result of the new steamboat power. Wholesalers, new banks, and other retail stores opened starting in the late 1820s and early 1830s. The <b>fur</b> trade continued as a major industry into the 1830s. In 1822, Jedediah Smith joined William H. Ashley's St. Louis <b>fur</b> trading company. Smith would later be known for his explorations of the West and for being the first American to travel overland to California. New <b>fur</b> trade companies such as the Rocky Mountain <b>Fur</b> Company pioneered trails west. Although beaver <b>fur</b> lost its popularity in the 1840s, St. Louis continued as a hub of buffalo hide and other furs.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the mid-19th}} century, coyote <b>fur</b> was {{considered}} worthless. This {{changed with the}} diminution of beavers, and by 1860, the hunting of coyotes for their <b>fur</b> became {{a great source of}} income (75 cents to $1.50 per skin) for wolfers in the Great Plains. Coyote pelts were of significant economic importance during the early 1950s, ranging in price from $5 to $25 per pelt, depending on locality. The coyote's <b>fur</b> is not durable enough to make rugs, but can be used for coats and jackets, scarves, or muffs. The majority of pelts are used for making trimmings, such as coat collars and sleeves for women's clothing. Coyote <b>fur</b> is sometimes dyed black as imitation silver fox.|$|E
