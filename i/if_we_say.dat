500|$|The {{group had}} up to 500 members, chosen from {{young men in}} the Palestinian refugee camps and in Lebanon, who were promised good pay and help looking after their families. They {{would be sent to}} {{training}} camps in whichever country was hosting the ANO at the time (Syria, Iraq or Libya), then organized into small cells. Once in, As`ad AbuKhalil and Michael Fischbach write, they were not allowed to leave again. The group assumed complete control over the membership. One member who spoke to Patrick Seale was told before being sent overseas: [...] "If we say, 'Drink alcohol'", do so. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>say,</b> 'Get married,' find a woman and marry her. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>say,</b> 'Don't have children,' you must obey. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>say,</b> 'Go and kill King Hussein,' you must be ready to sacrifice yourself!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{equivalence}} relation ~ thus defined is additive {{in the following}} sense: Suppose E1 ~ F1 and E2 ~ F2. If E1 ⊥ E2 and F1 ⊥ F2, then [...] E1 + E2 ~ F1 + F2.

2500|$|Because God is [...] "an {{absolutely}} perfect being" [...] (I), Leibniz {{argues that}} God would be acting imperfectly if he acted with any less perfection {{than what he}} is able of (III). His syllogism then ends {{with the statement that}} God has made the world perfectly in all ways. This also effects how we should view God and his will. Leibniz states that, in lieu of God’s will, {{we have to understand that}} God [...] "is the best of all masters" [...] and he will know when his good succeeds, so we, therefore, must act in conformity to his good will – or as much of it as we understand (IV). In our view of God, Leibniz declares that we cannot admire the work solely because of the maker, lest we mar the glory and love God in doing so. Instead, we must admire the maker for the work he has done (II). Effectively, Leibniz states that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>say</b> the earth is good because of the will of God, and not good according to some standards of goodness, then how can we praise God for what he has done if contrary actions are also praiseworthy by this definition (II). Leibniz then asserts that different principles and geometry cannot simply be from the will of God, but must follow from his understanding.|$|E

2500|$|Manchester United {{were unable}} to defend their FA Cup title the {{following}} season, having instead been invited {{to compete in the}} inaugural FIFA Club World Championship in Brazil. The Football Association (FA) encouraged the club {{to take part in the}} new tournament as they believed it would help their bid to host the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Alex Ferguson initially suggested that The FA could allow his team a bye to a later round of the competition to help alleviate the fixture congestion that would arise from entering both competitions, but the FA suggested that Manchester United simply pull out of the FA Cup altogether, putting the club in what chairman Martin Edwards called a [...] "no-win" [...] situation. Edwards said: [...] "We're going to get criticised whatever we do. If we don't go people will say that we are selfish and only looking after ourselves and not prepared to help the 2006 World Cup bid. But we will also be criticised <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>say</b> we're not going to compete in the FA Cup." [...] The offer was also criticised by Manchester United fans, with Andy Walsh of the Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association saying: [...] "They've shown very little offer of help in the past when United have looked to ease their fixture congestion. This blinding conversion is all to do with the 2006 campaign." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{argument}} {{was based on}} comments by K. Shanmugam, the Minister for Law, at a dialogue session on 9 May 2010. When asked whether Yong's case would affect Singapore's laws on the mandatory death penalty, the Minister had replied: [...] "Yong Vui Kong is young. But <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>say,</b> 'We let you go', what's the signal we're sending? ... We are sending a signal to all drug barons out there: Just make sure you choose a victim who's young or a mother of a young child and use them as the people to carry drugs into Singapore." [...] Commenting to the media, Ravi {{said that if the}} clemency decision was indeed taken by the Cabinet and not the President, then since Shanmugam {{was a member of the}} Cabinet and these statements were made while Yong's case was sub judice, his remarks implied a prejudgment of Yong's appeal for clemency. The Ministry of Law rejected as [...] "incorrect" [...] Ravi's remarks that the clemency process was flawed. It stated that as the Government's policy on the death penalty for drug offences was a [...] "matter of public importance", the Government was entitled to comment on it. The Law Ministry also clarified that Shanmugam's comments were merely concerned with the Government's legislative policy and whether it would change, and that the Minister had not commented on any specific issue which was before the Court of Appeal at the time, or on what the outcome of the judgment should be.|$|E
