40|$|Pichia guilliermondii strain Z 1, {{which was}} {{previously}} {{proven to be}} effective against blue mold of citrus fruit, has been further tested in controlled conditions {{to determine whether the}} yeast, as an alternative for synthetic fungicides, would be compatible with other postharvest practices used commercially. In particular, commercial fruit waxes can reduce their survival and effectiveness. The commercial fruit waxes tested, in combination at 20 % with strain Z 1, included microcrystalline, <b>ester</b> <b>gum,</b> candelilla, beeswax, montan, paraffin, rice bran, rosin maleic, carnauba, shellac, and one mixture shellac plus carnauba. Beeswax, paraffin, rosin maleic, carnauba, and shellac increased significantly strain Z 1 survival in Petri dish assays. Candelilla, beeswax, rice bran, rosin maleic, carnauba, shellac, and shellacecarnauba mixture did not significantly reduce the strain Z 1 yield on orange fruit surfaces compared to other waxes. With the exception of rosin maleic wax, none of the commercial fruit waxes or mixture increased significantly the ability of the formulated product of strain Z 1 to control the postharvest pathogen Penicillium italicum on wounded orange fruit. When the formulated product of strain Z 1 was used in combination with beeswax, strain Z 1 retained the same efficacy. In contrast, microcrystalline, <b>ester</b> <b>gum,</b> candelilla, montan, paraffin, rice bran, carnauba, shellac, and shellac-carnauba mixture significantly reduced the effectiveness of the formulated product of strain Z 1. No antibiosis was detected for strain Z 1 against P. italicum. Strain Z 1 inhibited the spore germination for the low juice concentration (up to 5 %) when compared to the control. However, the addition of fresh juice after antagonist removal allowed the restoration of the germination of P. italicum spores; suggesting the possibility of competition for nutrients in the biocontrol activity of strain Z 1. The study demonstrates the potential commercial application of strain Z 1 with beeswax and rosin maleic wax for postharvest control of citrus blue mold. As biocontrol relies on competition for nutrients, an enriched formulation with nutrients is needed for reliable antifungal activity of this yeast strainPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Polyvinyl {{chloride}} (PVC) was plasticized with epoxidized {{linseed oil}} (ELO) an further added with triethylene glycol <b>ester</b> of <b>gum</b> rosin (TEGR) as natural viscosity increasing agent. Although, {{the addition of}} both additives resulted in some colour changes, since TEGR induced red tone and ELO produced an amber tonality, all formulations showed high brightness and transparency. FTIR was used to study {{the changes in the}} plastisol chemical structures due to the addition of both natural additives. The microstructure of plastisols, studied by SEM observations, further confirmed that ELO and TEGR presented good compatibility with PVC resin, particularly when a mixture of ELO and TEGR was used. Therefore, changing the proportion of both natural additives allows designing tunable plastisols employing renewable materials. Authors thank United Resins, ProduÇão de Resinas S.

40|$|High {{saturated}} {{fatty acid}} content in coconut milk can be reduced by adding unsaturated fat. Pretreatment such as pasteurisation, homogenization or stabilizer and emulsifier addition are essential to prevent emulsion deterioration that could happen in few hours. This study aimed to determine the most appropriate combination of gum arabic and sucrose ester to produce good emulsion stability based on its physical and chemical characteristics. Furthermore this study also aimed to determine correlation between creaming index and other characteristics of coconut milk emulsion. Emulsion stability of mixed coconut milk in sterile glass bottles was observed for 7 days under 23 - 24 °C. Stabilizer and emulsifier added were gum arabic and sucrose ester in five combinations, i. e. 6 % gum arabic, 0. 3 % sucrose <b>ester,</b> 6 % <b>gum</b> arabic + 0. 3 % sucrose <b>ester,</b> 3 % <b>gum</b> arabic + 0. 15 % sucrose ester and 4. 5 % gum arabic + 0. 225 % sucrose ester. The physical characteristics evaluated were creaming index, total color change, viscosity and droplet distribution, while the chemical characteristics observed included pH, TBA value, and protein content. Data were analyzed by One Way Anova at 95 % significant level to determine the differences among treatments. Bivariate Pearson Correlation was used {{in order to determine}} the interaction among sample characteristics. The data showed that, gum arabic and sucrose ester can maintain the emulsion stability. A combination of 4. 5 % gum arabic and 0. 225 % sucrose ester provided the best physicochemical characteristics with the lowest creaming index and decreased viscosit, and uniform droplet distribution...|$|R

On the 80 th day, many mature brood capsules with scolices fully developed, daughter cysts and numerous calcareous corpuscles were present in the vesicles. The culture-chamber was full of vesicles with a remarkable number of brood capsules containing many scolices after 6 months. No multilocular vesiculation by exogenous budding was recognized...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to introduce new green, nontoxic, cost effective derivatives of guar gum (GG- 1). Guar gum is one of the important naturally occurring non-ionic polysaccharide which has incredible applications due to its rheological modifying properties in medicinal, pharmaceutical, food, textile, cosmetics, water treatment, mining, drilling, explosives, confectioneries and scores of other industrial and commercial sectors. Guar gum, also called guaran, is a galactomannan. It is primarily the ground endosperm of guar beans. The guar seeds are dehusked, milled and screened to obtain the guar gum. It is typically produced as a free-flowing, off-white powder. The adaptation of physical properties of GG- 1 & GG- 2 can improve and diversify its commercial applications. In this project, novel and efficient synthesis of five different new derivatives (120 - 124) of guar gum were done by insitu activation of cinnamic acid, ferulic acid, caffeic acid, coumaric acid and hydrocinnamic acid by coupling with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and N, N-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). Effect of temperature, concentration of reactants and time interval plays important role for determining DS value of guar esters. Reaction conditions were optimized for each reaction. Antioxidant potential was examined by DPPH method. A rapid method for protecting the hydroxyl group in sterically hindered gum has been developed by using microwave assisted synthesis (MAS). A novel and efficient synthesis of different guar gum derivatives (126 - 133) such as acetate, butyrate propionate, maleate, succinate, phthalate, citraconate and glutarate have been developed by microwave irradiation. The maximum ester formation was successfully achieved in 15 minutes at 600 W by using iodine and DMAP as a reaction promoter. <b>Gum</b> <b>ester</b> formation was obtained by concentration variation at different time intervals. The products were characterized by IR and NMR spectroscopy and SEM. Moreover, degree of substitution was also calculated for each experiment by titration method. First time fatty acid esters (C 5 -C 18) were formulated (136 - 145) via acid chloride route. Reaction proceeded in two steps. First step involves conventional synthesis of fatty acid chlorides (135 a- 135 j) by reacting corresponding acid with slight excess of thionyl chloride (134). Second step involves esterification of free hydroxyl group of GG- 2 with acid chloride; as a result novel derivatives (136 - 145) with fascinating thickening and emulsifying properties were obtained which might be promising candidate for cosmetic and food industry. Physical properties were examined like solubility, surface morphological study, swellingbehavior, gelation index etc. Different spectroscopic techniques were used for structure elucidation. In situ hydrolysis of guar esters were done in DCl during NMR experiments due to the poor solubility of guar derivatives. Guar derivatives with variable degree of substitution (DS) were prepared and were confirmed by FT-IR spectroscopy, presence of carbonyl signal confirmed the formation of guar ester. Further structural elucidation was done by 1 H-NMR. Surface morphological study of guar esters was done by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) which showed networking in guar derivatives whichenhanced when degree of substitution increased. Degree of substitution was determined quantitatively by titration method for each derivativ...|$|R
