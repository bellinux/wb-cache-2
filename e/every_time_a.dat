5|$|In a contest, a row {{of small}} cages, each housing a single male finch, is lined up {{approximately}} six feet apart along a street. The close proximity of the cages increases the number of calls, as the birds sing for mates and to establish territory. A timekeeper begins and ends the contest with a red flag. <b>Every</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> bird sings a correct terminating flourish to their callmost often transcribed as susk-e-wieta tally mark in chalk is made on a long wooden stick. The bird singing its song the most times during one hour wins the contest. Champion finches regularly sing hundreds of calls in contests.|$|E
25|$|Virtual {{profiling}} is {{a method}} of creating profiles without attaching the thermocouples (TCs) or having to physically instrument a PCB each and <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> profile is run for the same production board. All the typical profile data such as slope, soak, TAL, etc., that are measured by instrumented profiles are gathered by using virtual profiles. The benefits of not having attached TCs surpass the convenience of not having to instrument a PCB <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> new profile is needed.|$|E

25|$|During the 1980s {{and early}} 1990s the {{magazine}} placed many thrash and glam metal acts {{on the cover}} (like Mötley Crüe, Slayer, Bon Jovi, Metallica, Poison, and Venom) but later discarded them when grunge acts such as Nirvana rose to fame. Readers often criticise the magazine for repeating this process <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> new musical trend becomes popular.|$|E
25|$|The Incas built {{suspension}} rope bridges using grass. These bridges, {{which were}} made from ropes ingeniously tied together, formed a narrow but effective structure. This {{was the only way}} to cross rivers on foot. If only one of their hundreds of bridges was damaged, a major road could not fully function. Fortunately, <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> bridge broke, the locals would repair it as quickly as possible.|$|E
25|$|This would {{reconcile}} the contradiction between our {{belief in the}} certainty of abstract deductions and the empiricist principle that knowledge comes from observation of individual instances. We know that Euler's equation is true because <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> human mind derives the equation, it gets the same result, unless it has made a mistake, which can be acknowledged and corrected. We observe this phenomenon, and we extrapolate to the general proposition that it is always true.|$|E

25|$|When {{all players}} have passed {{priority}} in succession, the top-most spell or ability on the stack resolves. If {{it was a}} sorcery, instant, or ability, the player carries out the instructions; if it would create a permanent, it enters the battlefield. <b>Every</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> spell or ability finishes resolving, players (starting with the player whose turn it is) can once again add more to the stack; if they don't, the new top-most spell or ability will resolve.|$|E

25|$|A unique {{feature of}} these units {{is that there}} is a {{variable}} traction control system in their computer systems. One of the differences between an ES44AC and an ES44C4 are the air cylinders and linkages on the truck sideframes of the ES44C4; these are part of the traction control system. <b>Every</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> variation in grade, traction, or wheel slip occurs, the computer will adjust the pressure in these cylinders to maintain sufficient adhesion, by varying the weight on the drive axles.|$|E

25|$|Lights can be powered through {{electromagnetic}} induction. Reelight, a Danish company, is {{well known}} for this and claims as much as one third of all bikes in Denmark feature it. The lights are mounted on the bike wheels and powered <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> magnet on the wheel spoke passes, eliminating the need for batteries. The advantages are pretty much the same as with dynamo lighting while incurring less resistance to the rider than traditional dynamos and eliminating the noise and wear of the tire.|$|E
25|$|Card {{counting}} is {{most rewarding}} {{near the end}} of a complete shoe when as few as possible cards remain. Single-deck games are therefore particularly susceptible to card counting. As a result, casinos are more likely to insist that players do not reveal their cards to one another in single-deck games. In games with more decks of cards, casinos limit penetration by ending the shoe and reshuffling when one or more decks remain undealt. Casinos also sometimes use a shuffling machine to reintroduce the exhausted cards <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> deck has been played.|$|E

25|$|All public {{crossings}} in the United States {{are required}} to be marked by at least a crossbuck. The 2009 Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices requires passive crossings (crossings without actuated flashing lights or gates) to have either stop signs or yield signs {{in addition to the}} crossbuck, unless a flagger will stop traffic <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> train approaches. Normally a yield sign is used, unless it is determined that all vehicles should stop at the crossing, such as a location with poor sight distance. All passive crossings must be upgraded to meet this standard by December 31, 2019.|$|E

The finale to {{the ride is}} a Vekoma Madhouse located away from the real Towers but themed as a secret vault. The storyline {{is based on a}} local legend about the chained oak tree, located in a nearby forest, and makes use {{of the history of the}} Towers. It draws its theme from the legend of the 15th Earl of Shrewsbury who was said to be cursed by a beggar woman to suffer death <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> branch falls from an old oak tree.|$|E
25|$|Grace was 50 {{years and}} 320 days old {{on the last}} day of the first Test. It says a lot about The Champion that he was still worth his place as a batsman. But he could no longer bend down, so his fielding was poor, and the Nottinghamshire crowd jeered and heckled him for it <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>a</b> ball went past him at point. Grace himself put it to the {{selection}} committee that he should be dropped for the second Test, and after some debate this is what happened. Only one man has played Test cricket at a greater age. He is Wilfred Rhodes, who coincidentally made his debut in the first Test.|$|E
