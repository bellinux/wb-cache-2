2500|$|In a 1965 interview, Demeter {{alleged that}} when the Phillies put him at third base, they would {{sometimes}} alter {{the dynamics of the}} infield. He said, [...] "They used to let the grass grow for me whenever I played third base over <b>in</b> <b>Philly.</b> And whenever Cal McLish pitched, they'd be out there in the afternoon wetting down the grass in front of the plate."

2500|$|Still {{having a}} bit of extra money from {{starring}} in the successful sitcom, the duo decided to stage a comeback album in 1991, Homebase. [...] The platinum album featured a more mature sound from the group, with Smith rapping in a deeper, consistent voice and changed their sound to fit the era's trend of hip-hop. Homebase featured the lead-off single “Summertime”, which added rap lyrics {{to the music of}} the Kool & the Gang instrumental [...] "Summer Madness" [...] and has become one of their most enduring hits. The video features clips from a family reunion <b>in</b> <b>Philly,</b> and shows the duo being driven around while sitting atop a car. Summertime earned the duo its second Grammy win. The next singles were [...] "Ring My Bell" [...] and [...] "Things That U Do". Both featured the typical sound of the early 90s. Both videos for the songs featured a different version from the original found on the LP.|$|E
2500|$|According to The Twist, by Jim Dawson, Dave Appell, {{working for}} Kal Mann and Bernie Lowe's Cameo-Parkway Records of Philadelphia, wanted {{to record a}} version of the Midnighters' hit, [...] "The Twist." [...] Although Ballard was {{credited}} as the sole writer of the song, its origins allegedly went back further than that. In the summer of 1960, while serving as bandleader of Cameo-Parkway's house band, Appell wanted to re-record the song, as he saw the song as having hit potential. In the meantime, Dick Clark, the host of ABC's American Bandstand, also noticed how local white teens <b>in</b> <b>Philly</b> were dancing to Hank and The Midnighters' original, and felt the same as Appell. But, having no literal or financial connection to The Midnighters' record label, King Records, Clark had no way to capitalize on The Midnighters' song. Clark gave promotion and airplay to two of The Midnighters records, [...] "Finger Popping Time", and [...] "Let's Go, Let's Go, Let's Go" [...] on American Bandstand in exchange for King Records president Syd Nathan giving Clark licensing rights for one of his artists on Cameo Parkway,one Ernest Evans, later to be known as Chubby Checker, to record The Twist. Clark was part owner of Cameo-Parkway, and several other record companies at the time.|$|E
