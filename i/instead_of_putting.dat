He preferred a non-frontal angle, which shows a better depth of the relief and the skills of the relief maker. To stress its timeless beauty, van Kinsbergen blocked out the original background in the negative film <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> up a black curtain during photographing.|$|E
5|$|Holmboe {{published}} his first textbook in mathematics in 1825. The 274-page book was named Lærebog i Mathematiken. Første Deel (Textbook in Mathematics. Part One). In 1827 he followed {{with the second}} volume, Lærebog i Mathematiken. Anden Deel (Textbook in Mathematics. Part Two), consisting of a further 155 pages. He used his own teaching experience as the background for his writing; mainly abstract, {{the purpose of the}} books was to instill logical thinking. For instance, in the field geometry, it enticed readers to envisage a figure <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> it to paper. The books became widely used, and were reprinted in four and five volumes respectively.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before {{approaching}} {{the town of}} the first Gym Leader, the protagonist first encounters Team Magma/Aqua in the Petalburg Woods, {{where he or she}} rescues a worker from Devon (a company that manufactures Pokéballs) and recovers Devon merchandise. Upon arriving in Fallarbor Town (after defeating the third Gym Leader), the protagonist discovers that Professor Cozmo, an astronomer, has been kidnapped by Magma/Aqua. The protagonist traces them to a cave, Meteor Falls, but is too late to stop them from escaping to Mt. Chimney with a meteorite. The protagonist follows Magma/Aqua to Mt. Chimney where they are preparing to use the meteorite to alter the climate of the region. The protagonist defeats the Team's leader, however, and returns the meteorite to Professor Cozmo. Shortly after the protagonist defeats the fifth Gym Leader (the protagonist's father, the first time such a character appears), Magma/Aqua again attempts to change the region's climate by stealing a Castform, a Pokémon with the ability to change the weather, from the Weather Institute. After the protagonist defeats the sixth Gym Leader, Magma/Aqua steals an orb with the ability to control a legendary Pokémon (Groudon in Ruby, Kyogre in Sapphire). Magma/Aqua then steals a submarine from Captain Stern in Slateport City; the protagonist, however, infiltrates the team's hideout, but fails to prevent the submarine from being used. Magma/Aqua, then travel with the orb to the Seafloor Cavern, where Groudon or Kyogre resides; the team then uses the orb to awaken the legendary Pokémon, but they have chosen the wrong one and have instead enraged the Pokémon <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> it under their thrall. Once awakened, the Pokémon travels to the Cave of Origin and causes a region-wide drought (Ruby) or severe rainstorms (Sapphire). When the protagonist defeats (or captures) the Pokémon, the region's weather returns to normal.|$|E

25|$|There are two pathologies. One is {{interpreting}} myth as pseudo-science, {{as though}} {{it had to do with}} directing nature <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> oneself in accord with nature, and the other is the political interpretation of myths to the advantage of one group within a society, or one society within a group of nations.|$|E
25|$|Another way PSFS taught {{children}} {{to save money}} in savings banks was a program that produced pageants for playgrounds and settlement houses. The pageants included songs about thriftiness set to popular music, cheers, speeches that quoted historical figures' opinions on thriftiness, and a play. In the plays, costumed children warned the audience about spending money on treats, movies, and penny arcades <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> the money in a savings bank where it would grow.|$|E
25|$|As {{the year}} progresses, the colony changes its style of obtaining food {{for both the}} larvae and adults. In April, when the queen {{normally}} lays her eggs, the workers actively go out and forage. However, typically around the fall season, a change is observed in the colony as the foraging workers turn into scavengers. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> forth the effort to find food sources, the workers try to take what is more easily available. For example, European hornets have been seen hovering around garbage cans and picnic areas in the fall.|$|E

25|$|Early in {{the third}} quarter, Testaverde narrowed the score to 16–10 with a 17-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Wayne Chrebet. Later in the quarter, Raiders defensive back Johnnie Harris stripped the ball from fullback Richie Anderson and lineman Grady Jackson recovered the ball for Oakland on their own 45-yard line. After a short run by Garner, Gannon's 47-yard completion to Rice moved {{the ball to the}} Jets 4-yard line. A few plays later, fullback Zack Crockett scored a 2-yard touchdown run on the first play of the fourth quarter, giving the Raiders a 24–10 lead. But <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> the game away, Crockett's score set off a wild scoring explosion from both teams, who ended up combining for 36 points in the final quarter as Testaverde desperately tried to rally his team back.|$|E
25|$|<b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> the clauses {{creating}} CPE {{inside the}} bill it was proposing to Parliament, the government chose to submit {{it as an}} amendment of its own text. This bypasses some compulsory legal review by the Conseil d'État and reduces the time available for examination {{by members of the}} Parliament. Earlier in 2006, president of the Assembly Jean-Louis Debré, though a fellow member of UMP and an ally of Villepin, complained about the Villepin government submitting lengthy amendments of its own bills and said that it showed these bills were badly prepared. Furthermore, Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin forced approval of the law by the Assembly on its first reading by invoking article 49-3 of the Constitution: under 49-3, a bill is considered approved in its present state by the Assembly unless the Assembly chooses to dismiss the Prime Minister. Such a move hardly ever occurs, since both the Assembly and the Prime Minister are from the same majority. Use of 49-3 is seen as an infringement on the legislative prerogatives of Parliament and is thus reserved for exceptional cases. As many have pointed out, especially when the Prime Minister announced the use of 49-3, Dominique de Villepin has never run for elected office.|$|E
25|$|In late 2010 L.A. Park {{began asking}} Konnan {{for a shot}} at the AAA Mega Championship and was promised his shot if he managed to defeat El Mesías at Guerra de Titanes. Park did just that, but <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> {{together}} a match between him and the new Mega Champion, his La Sociedad partner El Zorro, the next title shot was awarded to Los Bizarros member Charly Manson to set up a grudge match for the title between him and El Zorro, causing dissension between Park and Konnan. On February 28 Park entered the 2011 Rey de Reyes tournament in order to solidify his spot as the number one contender, defeating Dr. Wagner Jr., Halloween and Nicho el Millonario in his semifinal match. During the match Park was attacked by La Sociedad member Damián 666, who was seemingly trying to prevent him from advancing in the tournament, but instead the interference distracted Wagner Jr. and cost him the match. On March 18 at the Rey de Reyes pay-per-view, Park was eliminated from the finals of the tournament, after brawling with rival El Mesías to a double countout. At the same event Los Perros del Mal, represented by El Hijo del Perro Aguayo, Damián 666, Halloween and Super Crazy, continued their win streak over Los Psycho Circus, by defeating them and Dr. Wagner Jr., the alliance known as Potencia Mundial, in an eight-man tag team match. Meanwhile, El Zorro was successful in his first title defense by defeating Charly Manson. At the following television taping on March 21, Konnan, disappointed with the performance of La Milicia, demoted Decnnis and named Super Fly the sub–group's new leader. Later that same night, Los Maniacos lost the AAA World Tag Team Championship to Jack Evans and the 2011 Rey de Reyes, Extreme Tiger. Following the loss, Silver King and Último Gladiador began showing signs of dissension, but were brought back together by La Legión Extranjera member Chessman, who joined Los Maniacos to form La Maniarquía. Meanwhile, the AAA Mega Champion El Zorro, having caught wind of L.A. Park's intention of challenging for his title, seemingly started interfering in his matches under his old mask, costing him back–to–back multi–man tag team matches at the April 27 and 30 TV tapings, escalating the dissension within La Sociedad in the process. In early May, Jeff Jarrett, the founder of American promotion Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, announced his and TNA's alignment with Dorian Roldán and La Sociedad and their participation in Triplemanía XIX. Konnan, however, was against the idea of his former employer coming to AAA and believed that Roldán had made a mistake. Jarrett and fellow TNA worker Abyss arrived to AAA on May 18 for a confrontation with Konnan and La Sociedad. In the end, Konnan and Jarrett revealed that they were in fact on the same page with each other and turned on El Zorro, along with L.A. Park, with Konnan announcing that Jarrett would be challenging for his AAA Mega Championship at Triplemanía XIX. It was later revealed that the man who had attacked Park under El Zorro's mask was actually Charly Manson, who had been sent by Cibernético to cause dissension within the ranks of La Sociedad. On June 18 at Triplemanía XIX, Damián 666, Halloween and X-Fly defeated Los Psycho Circus in a tournament final to become the first ever AAA World Trios Champions, while Jeff Jarrett defeated El Zorro to become the new AAA Mega Champion and L.A. Park ended his feud with El Mesías by defeating him in a Mask vs. Hair match.|$|E

500|$|The third {{reason the}} product was brought back was because of a new {{approach}} the company was taking regarding LTO products; <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> out large numbers of products that may only appeal to a small audience, it instead would only add a smaller amount of products that have broader market appeal. Chicken Fries were part of that goal, with the re-introduction utilizing a three prong approach: its stated intention to introduce products to those that will have most impact, a bid to appeal to Millennials utilizing social media focused campaigns, and to utilize a former product from its portfolio that the company probably should have thought about before discontinuing. The idea of reintroducing older products is appealing to companies such as Burger King and McDonald's because it is operationally easier than launching a completely new product by allowing a company to utilize older advertising along with its existing supply chain already which is already established to deliver the product ingredients. The limited-time offers allow chains to bring [...] "new" [...] product the menu without adding permanent complexity to their kitchen operations.|$|E

In {{an interview with}} Kevin Fitzpatrick of UGO, Clark spoke of the episode and proclaimed {{that it was a}} [...] "really fun opportunity" [...] to see what Mark's clone would be like, calling him an [...] "Agro-Mark". He said that Matt Oberg, the voice of Mark, voiced the clone as a [...] "much more gruff individual". Clark elaborated, [...] "It's really funny. It's like seeing Mark, since we kind of play him so neutered most of the time, it's like seeing him as like this jerk, it's hilarious, it's a very funny story." [...] Executive producer Daniel Powell said that Clone Mark [...] "glove slaps everyone [...] a cigarette <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> it out before the office". [...] "Attack of Mark's Clone" [...] was the eighth episode to be produced for the second season.

500|$|A {{primary reason}} {{the product was}} brought back was because of a new {{approach}} the company was taking regarding new and limited time offering (LTO) products. [...] <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> out large numbers of products that may only appeal to a small audience, it would only add a smaller amount of products that have broader market appeal. Along with its BK Chicken Fries product, the Big King {{was part of that}} goal, with the reintroduction utilizing a three prong approach: its stated intention to introduce products to those that will have most impact, a bid to appeal to Millennials utilizing social media focused campaigns, and to utilize a former product from its portfolio that the company probably should have thought about before discontinuing. The idea of reintroducing older, possibly discontinued products is appealing to companies such as Burger King and McDonald's because it is operationally easier than launching a completely new product. In many cases the reintroduction allows these companies to utilize older advertising along with its existing supply chain which is already established to deliver the product ingredients while catering to the public's feelings of nostalgia for these products. The limited-time offers allow chains to bring [...] "new" [...] products to the menu without adding permanent complexity to their kitchen operations. The Chicken Big King was introduced because of an increased spike in demand for chicken-based products, coupled with the success of the Big King's reintroduction.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by John Swartzwelder, and {{directed}} by Jim Reardon. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening {{thought it was a}} [...] "quintessential" [...] Swartzwelder episode, and executive producer/show runner David Mirkin said it was a [...] "fantastic job by one of the most prolific writers of the show". The most important thing to Mirkin while making the episode was {{to make sure that the}} elephant would be a [...] "bastard" [...] and behave rudely, unlike other animals on the show. For example, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> people on his back, Stampy would put them in his mouth. Mirkin said the elephant [...] "never quite bonds because it's a very cantankerous animal, a concept that was very important to this episode". Stampy has since been used several times in jokes later on in the series. For example, Stampy made an appearance in the season nine episode [...] "Miracle on Evergreen Terrace" [...] in one of Bart's dreams, and in the season fourteen episode [...] "Large Marge", where he is used by Bart in a stunt to help Krusty the Clown win back his popularity. Stampy appeared briefly in The Simpsons Movie, where he tries to break down the giant glass dome lowered over Springfield. The episode also introduces the character Cletus Spuckler. He is shown as one of the [...] "slack-jawed yokels" [...] gawking at Stampy in the Simpson family's backyard. Cletus is not named in the episode, so the staff simply referred to him as the Slack-Jawed Yokel.|$|E
