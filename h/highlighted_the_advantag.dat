40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to termination analysis of logic programs. The essence of the approach is that we make use of general orderings (instead of level mappings), like it is done in transformational approaches to logic program termination analysis, but we apply these orderings directly to the logic program and not to the term-rewrite system obtained through some transformation. We define some variants of acceptability, based on general orderings, and show how they are equivalent to LD-termination. We develop a demand driven, constraint-based approach to verify these acceptability-variants. <b>The</b> <b>advantag...</b>|$|R

40|$|For ultra-small {{semiconductor}} devices in which quantum effects are present, the corresponding mathematical models have {{to incorporate the}} quantum mechanical phenomena. Roughly speaking, these models {{can be divided into}} two classes: microscopic and macroscopic quantum models. Microscopic models include quantum kinetic equations, like the Wigner equation and the Wigner-(Poisson-) Fokker-Plank model, and Schrödinger-Poisson systems [4, 30]. It has been known {{since the early days of}} quantum mechanics [26, 36] that these microscopic models can be written in hydrodynamic form using macroscopic quantities like the electron density or current density. The hydrodynamic form of quantum kinetic equations is termed quantum hydrodynamic models. <b>The</b> <b>advantag...</b>|$|R

40|$|Shadows {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} light effects- far more so than fancy reflectance and BRDF models. The reason for this is that our brain makes great use of shadows to aid spatial awareness. Shadow volume generation (SV) has always attracted researchers to come up with something different to make it adaptable for game programmers and animation industries. Shadow volumes (SVs) usually takes time in generating boundary silhouettes of the object and if the object is complex then the generation of edges become much harder and slower in process. The challenge gets stiffer when real time shadow generation and rendering is demanded. Looking at this, we investigate a different approach and concentrate on initial phase of shadow volumes generation i. e.; a way to exploit the model simplification technique for reducing the number of triangles creating lesser silhouette edges for the model and later use the real time silhouette edge detection method, which takes <b>the</b> <b>advantag...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of stable cyclopropene, obtained {{on the basis}} of (-) camphene- 3, 3 -dimethylbicyclo[2. 2. 1]heptan- 2 -spirocyclopropene with 1 R, 4 S-configuration, was confirmed. There were shown the potentials of synthesis of this cyclopropene in the reactions of electrophilic sulphenylchloride addition. Results and Discussion Cyclopropenes are of certain interest for synthetic and theoretical chemistry because of their high reactivity and availability as syntons in the synthesis of practically useful compounds [1]. In this connection the development of the effective methods for obtaining the chiral molecules is an actual problem, that is especially important for the production of new bioactive compounds. The first asymmetric member of this class of compounds, (R) - 1, 3 -dimethylcyclopropene, which is, generally speaking, the smallest chiralhydrocarbon [2], was earlier obtained by Mark S. Baird and his co-workers. The synthesis was carried out in five stages, the key stage being the separation of intermediate racemic acid in enantiomers with the use of optically active bases. In the present work we describe the synthesis of chiral cyclopropene, substituted only on tetragonal carbon atom. <b>The</b> <b>advantag...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} for direct mapping of spectral density {{functions of the}} rotational motions of H-X bond vectors, such as ‘H-“N, by measuring a set of NMR relaxation parameters. The well known and frequently measured relaxation parameters T, and T, probe the spectral density function J(o) at five frequencies: 0, WN, wn, in- wN, and wu t wN. In this study, the longitudinal relaxation time T, (N,), the transverse relaxation times of in-phase coherence, T, (N,,Y), and of antiphase coherence, T 2 (2 H,N,,Y), the re-laxation time of longitudinal two-spin order, T,(2 H,N,), and the heteronuclear cross-relaxation rate bnN are measured for the heteronucleus N. These five relaxation parameters sample the spectral density function J(w) at the same five points where each measurement samples a subset of these frequencies with different weights. The five measurements permit an analytical calculation of J (w) at these five frequencies. Since longitudinal proton re-laxation {{plays a role in}} these relaxation parameters, a sixth measurement is necessary to determine this relaxation time. The theory and experimental techniques for measuring these relaxation parameters are discussed. Preliminary results of these techniques as applied to the 15 N-enriched protein eglin care described.

40|$|I am {{grateful}} for support from the Cato Institute for this project. I am also grateful to John Sabelhaus for allowing me to use his family level extracts constructed from the Consumer Expenditure Survey and to Andrew Mitrusi for helpful discussions and advice. Executive Summary I use data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) to measure the lifetime incidence of a shift from the current income tax to a National Retail Sales Tax. I show that {{the distribution of the}} tax reform depends in important ways on the measure of household well being. If annual income is used to rank households, the tax reform looks very regressive. When lifetime income is used to rank households, the tax reform continues to look regressive though much less regressive than when the annual income approach is used. I also consider various ways to add progressivity to the new tax system. If a universal rebate tied to poverty thresholds is coupled with the national sales tax, the system looks nearly as progressive as the current income tax system when households are ranked by lifetime income. The universal rebate in effect exempts from the sales tax spending by individuals and families up to the poverty threshold. Using the poverty threshold to construct the rebate has <b>the</b> <b>advantag...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this research, fast {{heuristics}} for {{a centralized}} multi-agent route planner are presented and computationally evaluated. We solve a sub-problem of warehouse scheduling involving the routing of intelligent agents as a preliminary step in optimizing the total schedule. The problem involves {{the generation of}} routes for automated agents tasked with the transfer of items within a warehouse from storage pallets to a common loading shed. The goal is to minimize the total distance of the routes {{and the number of}} routes generated. This constitutes a multiple-objective optimization problem which is NP-hard and hence can take a prohibitively long time to solve using existing search-based techniques. The approach adapted here is to model the system as a Split-Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem (SDVRP) with grid distances and to solve it using heuristics based on tested operations research concepts. Twenty-two such heuristics are tested including the well-known greedy Nearest-Neighbor (NN) heuristic, and the established Savings heuristic of Clarke and Wright. Two SDVRP variations of the NN algorithm are introduced, namely the Nearest-Fill (NF) and Nearest-Fill Farthest-Start (NFFS) heuristics. Existing SDVRP improvement procedures are also considered and generalized to produce numerous heuristic variations. This novel approach of applying fast vehicle routing heuristics to multi-agent routing has <b>the</b> <b>advantag...</b>|$|R

40|$|In 2002, we {{developed}} and released a rapid multiple sequence alignment program MAFFT {{that was designed}} to handle a huge (up to ∼ 5, 000 sequences) and long data (∼ 2, 000 aa or ∼ 5, 000 nt) in a reasonable time on a standard desktop PC. As for the accuracy, however, the previous versions (v. 4 and lower) of MAFFT were outperformed by ProbCons and TCoffee v. 2, both of which were released in 2004, in several benchmark tests. Here we report a recent extension of MAFFT that aims to improve the accuracy with as little cost of calculation time as possible. The extended version of MAFFT (v. 5) has new iterative refinement options, G-INS-i and L-INS-i (collectively denoted as [GL]-INS-i in this report). These options use a new objective function combining the weighted sum-of-pairs (WSP) score and a score similar to COFFEE derived from all pairwise alignments. We discuss the improvement in accuracy brought by this extension, mainly using two benchmark tests released very recently, BAliBASE v. 3 (for protein alignments) and BRAliBASE (for RNA alignments). According to BAliBASE v. 3, the overall average accuracy of L-INS-i was higher than those of other methods successively released in 2004, although the difference among the most accurate methods (ProbCons, TCoffee v. 2 and new options of MAFFT) was small. <b>The</b> <b>advantag...</b>|$|R
