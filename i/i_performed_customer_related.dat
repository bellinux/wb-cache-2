40|$|The {{insurance}} domain has {{the large}} amount of data to be presented as useful information. But there are no systematic techniques to produce the information. So, we apply the data mining techniques to mine the data, <b>related</b> to <b>customers,</b> in order to provide the new mined information to the insurance company. Most of the insurance companies have the <b>customer</b> <b>related</b> information as a whole. Here clustering, one of the data mining techniques can be used to group the <b>customer</b> <b>related</b> information into different clusters. Each cluster represents the similar group of customers. For example, in our application, the customers are clustered according to their type of the plan, age, marital status, method of premium payment, monthly income in order to identify the potentiality of the policy holders and to improve the benefits of the plans. There are many attributes that can be used as parameters to cluster the <b>customer</b> <b>related</b> data. Some of the sample attributes are mentioned above. In this implementation the data is clustered by using policy number as a parameter {{with the help of the}} enhanced k-medoid clustering algorithm...|$|R
40|$|Structural {{properties}} of generalised semi-Markov processes (GSMP) {{have been successfully}} studied in the literature. Examples are the celebrated commuting condition (CC), which is the key condition for unbiasedness of the infinitesimal perturbation analysis (IPA) gradient estimator, or the monotonicity condition (M), which implies stochastic order properties. When coming to queueing networks, these properties can be deduced from simple structural conditions on the topology of the network. Generally speaking, the results known so far apply to event times in GSMPs. Unfortunately, for multi or infinite server queueing networks, event times cannot be translated into <b>customer</b> <b>related</b> performance measures, such as sojourn times or waiting times. To overcome this drawback, we introduce in this paper a new technique, called 2 ̆ 2 compound events 2 ̆ 2. Compound events enable us to define event times {{in such a way}} that results with respect to event times can be translated into results with respect to <b>customer</b> <b>related</b> performance measures. We model a generic queueing network by means of a GSMP with compound events and we establish conditions on the topology of the queueing network that imply that the corresponding GSMP satisfies structural conditions like (CC) and (M). These structural conditions then imply {{properties of}} event times, like continuity or stochastic monotonicity. Using compound events, these results can be translated into properties of customer times, like sojourn times or waiting times. Our results extend the area of applicability of IPA to the analysis of <b>customer</b> <b>related</b> performance measures in multi–server queueing networks. Furthermore, we obtain new results on stochastic ordering of <b>customer</b> <b>related</b> performance measures...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this study has been to examine which significant values are of importance in the telecom sector today, and in a continuing perspective yet to be.  To ensure the factors of relevance in the study, we have identified three purposes:  - Our first purpose is to clarify the eminent values in the competitive market of the mobile phone operators today, {{and the reason for}} its importance. - The second purpose is to understand the function of the brand regarding to value creation and loyalty in the sector of mobile phone operators. - The third purpose is to explore the potential approaches for mobile phone operators to increase value. In this study, our approach has been a qualitative methodology by conducting seven interviews with respondents related to the telecommunication sector. As a result of the process, we find the need to divide the concept of value into two dimensions, which we entitle organizational <b>related</b> values and <b>customer</b> <b>related</b> values. We have found the values related to the characteristics of the market in aspects of its infrastructural features but also in regards to the homogenous core service. Our findings in the empirical data with support to our theoretical frame of reference, is the current highly important organizational related value of constant high result quality (well-functional technological aspect), and the value enhancer by a low price; the strategy of bundling also results in higher value. This result in <b>customer</b> <b>related</b> values that perceives as safeness, availableness and convenience. The brands are a significant source of <b>customer</b> <b>related</b> values with identity value, image value and assuredness. A continued advancement in process quality and individualization will imply greater <b>customer</b> <b>related</b> values of closeness, freedom and flexibility. ...|$|R

40|$|What is the {{influence}} of Information Technology (IT) capability, and customer relationship management (CRM) capability on organisational information privacy protection behaviour, and ultimately how do these relationships impact on organizational performance? What are the relationships between different types of IT capabilities (i. e. outside-in, inside-out, and spanning capabilities) {{and how do they}} impact on performance (i. e. directly or indirectly) ? This survey study attempted to answer these questions by empirically testing a research model based on the Resource Based-View (RBV) of the firm and the Comparative Advantage Theory of Competition to examine these relationships in the context of New Zealand firms engaged in IT supported CRM activities. RBV theory claims different subsets of a firm's resources (i. e. assets and capabilities) enable it to achieve initial and long-term competitive advantage (Barney, 1991). The role of different types of IS resources in achieving advantage has not been fully explored with some prior work finding evidence of direct effects but most finding only indirect effects of IS resources in general (Wade & Hulland, 2004). In addition, Comparative Advantage Theory claims a comparative advantage in resources leads to a competitive advantage in market position which in turn leads to superior financial performance (Hunt & Morgan, 1995). In turn, an organisation's use of customer information primarily for internal knowledge or external relationship building may be related to its privacy protection capability and how it measures performance (Greenaway & Chan, 2005) but these propositions had not yet been empirically tested. A review of the Information Systems literature showed that very little prior work had been done on organisational level privacy protection behaviours. The findings from my study begin to address these gaps in the literature. This research makes the following contributions to the academic literature on CRM. First, it empirically tested proposals found in the literature which suggested considering information privacy protection as a resource based on claims made by RBV theory. Second, the research splits IS capabilities into three groups (IS inside-out capability, outside-in capability and spanning capability), splits CRM capabilities into two groups (customer knowledge capability and <b>customer</b> <b>relating</b> capability) and splits organisational performance into two groups (effectiveness and efficiency) in order to assess the role of privacy protection practice as a mediating mechanism between different IS and CRM capabilities and organisational performance outcomes. The response data was analysed using Confirmatory Factor Analysis based on the Partial Least Squares parameter estimation technique, a form of Structural Equation Modelling. The findings show inside-out (internally focused) IT capabilities have a weak negative direct effect on <b>customer</b> <b>relating</b> capability. However, this can be mediated by investing in IT outside-in and IT spanning capabilities which {{have a positive impact on}} <b>customer</b> <b>relating</b> capability. Interestingly, IT Outside-in (externally focused) capabilities had a direct positive influence on customer knowledge capability. This was unexpected as earlier work predicted this relationship would be mediated by IT spanning resources. As expected, a comparative advantage in customer knowledge capability had a moderate direct positive impact on efficiency, measured as financial performance. It also had a moderate direct positive impact on producing a comparative advantage in <b>customer</b> <b>relating</b> capability. This supports CRM theory which claims that a better understanding of customers based on collecting and processing customer information can lead to a better <b>customer</b> <b>relating</b> capability. But, as predicted, no relationship to privacy protection capability was found. In contrast, using IT to gain a comparative advantage in <b>customer</b> <b>relating</b> capability had a direct positive impact on establishing privacy protection behaviours that exceed guidelines. Treating privacy protection as a resource also appears to lead to greater effectiveness which in turn leads to greater efficiency. In addition to contributing empirical evidence to support the conditions under which the proposed theoretical model applied, the results had several implications for practice. First, the findings provide organisations with greater awareness of how others in their industry are using IT to support <b>customer</b> <b>relating</b> and <b>customer</b> knowledge capabilities and how safeguarding or not safeguarding information privacy contributes directly to effectiveness and indirectly improves financial performance. Second, the findings are useful for raising consumer awareness about actual organisational information privacy practices. Most organisations in New Zealand reported meeting or exceeding industry guidelines. If the reported safeguards are in place and fair information handling practices are being followed, awareness of the results may help to reduce the high levels of privacy concern reported in consumer surveys. Lastly, privacy protection capabilities have a positive impact on performance, giving organisations an incentive to implement them...|$|R
