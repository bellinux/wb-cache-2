Eddy Creek flows through forested land in a reach downstream of US Route 6. Other land uses include <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> and open space.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1914, {{the lower}} {{course of the}} Don River was altered to improve flood management, however the new course caused more {{pollution}} to flow into the bay near the Ashbridges' land. In 1923, the bay was drained and filled to create <b>industrial</b> <b>land,</b> using fill dredged from the Toronto Harbour. The home which was once next to the shore was now located some distance away from the water.|$|E
5|$|Being {{a pilgrimage}} town, the {{majority}} of the population is involved in tourism related industry consisting of trade and services. Service sector increased from 70% in 1971 to 98.78% in 2001, while the agricultural sector reduced from 23% in 1971 to 0.13% in 2001. Rameswaram is an industrially backward town – there has been no demarcation for <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> due to the pilgrim sanctity and ecological fragile geography. Being an island town, the traditional occupation was fishing, but due to poor returns, the people in fishing community have gradually shifted to other professions. Banks such as State Bank of India, Indian Bank and RDCC Bank have their branches in Rameswaram.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, the New Jersey Department of Transportation {{introduced}} {{a case study}} for Route31 for its New Jersey: Future in Transportation project. Over time, the residents and business owners of Raritan Township and Flemington had growing concerns over the congestion along the highway and US202. After trying to use vacant land {{to the east of}} the current alignment, the Department of Transportation put forth the Flemington Bypass, trying to relieve congestion on Route31 along the commercial district and to provide access to the <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> between the two highways and the South Branch River. The project was never completed and the proposed site remains undeveloped. The Department of Transportation is now looking at a scaled-down bypass, proposed as the South Branch Parkway, to connect Route31 to US202 in Flemington.|$|E
5|$|Lethbridge is {{near the}} Lethbridge Airport and the CPR rail yards in Kipp, Alberta. The airport {{provides}} commercial flights to Calgary and Edmonton, as well as private and charter flights elsewhere. The airport provides customs services for flights arriving from the United States. The rail yards were moved to Kipp, {{just west of the}} city, from downtown Lethbridge in 1983. The yards were planned for redevelopment with a mix of multi-family residential, commercial and light <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> uses. The Park Place Mall is now located on the portion of the former rail yards north of 1Avenue South between Scenic Drive to the west and Stafford Drive to the east.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s {{and early}} 1970s {{some parts of}} Bath were unsympathetically redeveloped, {{resulting}} {{in the loss of}} some 18th- and 19th century buildings. This process was largely halted by a popular campaign which drew strength from the publication of Adam Fergusson's The Sack of Bath. Controversy has revived periodically, most recently with the demolition of the 1930s Churchill House, a neo-Georgian municipal building originally housing the Electricity Board, {{to make way for a}} new bus station. This is part of the Southgate redevelopment in which an ill-favoured 1960s shopping precinct, bus station and multi-story car park were demolished and replaced by a new area of mock-Georgian shopping streets. As a result of this and other changes, notably plans for abandoned <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> along the Avon, the city's status as a World Heritage Site was reviewed by UNESCO in 2009. The decision was made to let Bath keep its status, but UNESCO has asked to be consulted on future phases of the Riverside development, saying that the density and volume of buildings in the second and third phases of the development need to be reconsidered. It also demands Bath do more to attract world-class architecture in new developments.|$|E
25|$|The {{expressway}} {{starts at}} the Queen Elizabeth Way. Proceeding southbound, the Creek and a stormwater pond {{can be seen on}} the right. From the QEW interchange to Barton Street, the expressway crosses over the Creek several times with <b>industrial</b> <b>lands</b> to the south (left) and <b>industrial</b> <b>lands</b> on the right as far as the CNR rail lines. This area's trees were removed from this area as part of the project; there are some remaining trees {{on both sides of the}} expressway at Barton Street.|$|R

5|$|Many populations, {{particularly}} in the Sydney region, inhabit areas of infrequent disturbance, such as golf courses, disused <b>industrial</b> <b>land,</b> brick pits, and landfill areas. Though {{once one of the}} most common frogs in south-east Australia, the green and golden bell frog has endured major population declines, {{particularly in}} highland areas, leading to its current classification as globally vulnerable. Its numbers have continued to fall and are threatened by habitat loss and degradation, pollution, introduced species, and parasites and pathogens, including the chytrid Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. As most of the remaining populations live on private land, the logistics of the conservation effort can be complicated. Despite the situation in Australia, some frog populations have survived with more success in New Zealand and several other Pacific islands, where it has been introduced. However, unfortunately even in these areas the population of green and golden bell has been rapidly declining in the past few decades.|$|E
5|$|The state's {{economic}} recovery gathered momentum after economic liberalisations {{were introduced in}} the mid-1990s by the central government. This was aided by the advent of information technology and IT-enabled services. Starting in the mid-2000s, armed activists conducted minor terrorist attacks {{in some parts of}} the state while clashes with the administration took place at several controversial locations over the issue of <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> acquisition, which became a decisive reason behind the defeat of the ruling Left Front government in the 2011 assembly election. Although the economy was severely damaged during the unrest in the 1970s, the state has managed to revive its economy, steadily throughout the years. The state has shown improvement regarding bandhs (strikes) and educational infrastructure. Significant strides have been made in reducing unemployment. Though the state suffers from substandard healthcare services, a lack of socio-economic development, poor infrastructure, unemployment, and civil violence.|$|E

25|$|Agricultural {{and coastal}} <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> use {{has had an}} adverse effect on much of Maui's coastal regions. Many of Maui's {{extraordinary}} coral reefs have been damaged by pollution, run-off, and tourism, although finding sea turtles, dolphins, and Hawaii's celebrated tropical fish, is still common. Leeward Maui used to boast a vibrant dry 'cloud forest' as well but this was destroyed by human activities {{over the last three}} hundred years.|$|E
25|$|Lawrence saw {{growth in}} the {{industrial}} sector in the 1980s {{in part to the}} development of the East Hills Business Park in 1986. The <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> opportunities provided by the East Hills Business Park provided space for national companies such as AMARR Garage Doors to house one of their two manufacturing facilities. The new industrial park also provided opportunities for Kansas City-based company's like PROSOCO to move their business operations to Lawrence.|$|E

25|$|There {{was a lack}} {{of level}} ground at the site, and cutting and {{leveling}} the hill and filling in the bay became a top priority. Eventually, two square miles of Potrero Point were removed and hundreds of acres of flat <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> was created. Within two years and after one million dollars in expenses, foundries, piers, storehouses and wharves were in place, and the first finished iron produced on the West Coast came out of the mill.|$|E
25|$|More {{industrial}} estates and districts were built. This was {{because there was}} insufficient land for industrial development, leading to a rise in land rent. In 1971, every square metre of <b>industrial</b> <b>land</b> was sold at HK$1,329.09 at auctions. In this period, the industrial areas were spread all over the city, especially in the New Territories, where new towns such as Tuen Mun and Shatin, were built. A hire-purchase plan was also adopted to relieve pressure from buying land for industrial uses.|$|E
