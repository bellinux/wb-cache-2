50|$|The least {{recently}} used (LRU) page replacement algorithm, though {{similar in}} name to NRU, differs {{in the fact}} that LRU keeps track of page usage over a short period of time, while NRU <b>just</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the usage in the last clock interval. LRU works on the idea that pages that have been most heavily used in the past few instructions {{are most likely to be}} used heavily in the next few instructions too. While LRU can provide near-optimal performance in theory (almost as good as adaptive replacement cache), it is rather expensive to implement in practice. There are a few implementation methods for this algorithm that try to reduce the cost yet keep as much of the performance as possible.|$|E
5000|$|Killias {{has said}} that [...] "the fewer guns there are in cellars, attics and armoires, then that would be helpful, {{because there is a}} strong {{correlation}} between guns kept in private homes and incidences occurring at home - like private disputes involving the husband shooting the wife and maybe the children, and then committing suicide." [...] He has also said that as the Swiss government reduced the size of its Army, gun violence rates in that country have dropped. In response to those who cite Switzerland as evidence that guns deter violence, Killias {{has said that}} in Switzerland, [...] "We have guns at home, but they are kept for peaceful purposes.

5000|$|The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) {{characterized}} Hunt as [...] "confident", [...] "innovative", [...] "intelligent", {{while he}} {{also can be}} [...] "aggressive", [...] "brazen", [...] "presumptuous", [...] "hasty and rash". McKidd said of his character: [...] "... He's not an easy character to connect to, I think. There's some darkness to him and there's some danger to him that I think is really interesting and exciting to play. ..." [...] Additionally, McKidd describes Hunt as [...] "very instinctive, and follows his gut, and he's very impulsive, and very immediate. He immediately assesses a situation. And he's very honest, sometimes painfully honest, with himself and with others. He wants to make himself better. He wants to improve himself as a person. He's a decent guy, {{a sort of a}} guy I'd like to go out and have a beer with." [...] Hunt's unorthodox teaching methods {{have been the subject of}} controversy. McKidd said of this: [...] "You know, I think, at the end of the day, Owen's basically a good man who has some pretty extreme teaching techniques that he learned in the army. And all these things that are in the show are actually the way trauma surgeons are taught. But I think probably beyond that, he very much just calls a spade a spade and looks at each scenario. He's not trying to be difficult. He <b>just</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> each scenario and each case and each patient and knows what is needed and when to cut to the chase, and doesn't want to mess about with the periphery of it. And sometimes that gets him into trouble, and sometimes that is for the best. So, it'd be interesting and kind of exciting to see where he goes." [...] Kevin McKidd [...] The look of Owen has been described as hardcore and the antithesis of the other males on the show. McKidd says it's not just the look of Owen, but the fact that in his profession, he is dealing with life and death everyday. The one distinction he finds between his character and the others is that Owen does not care what other people think of him. When McKidd returned from his first appearance, his character appeared to have been changed. McKidd told TV Guide: [...] "Yes, that was who he really is in the premiere, but now we're seeing what can happen to a good man, a good soldier and good surgeon of war." ...|$|E
40|$|In businesses, {{knowledge}} {{of work is}} represented by a sequence of related work events and management of these relations {{is very important for}} users. This paper proposes a method that automatically groups related work events from user’s operation record on a Personal Information Management system(PIM). We assume that the related work events on a PIM are operated consecutively by a user. Our method accumulates the target event and time of the user’s operations such as inputs, changes, and references, and picks out all related events based on their recorded operation time. However, reference to events is an act that a user <b>just</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> an event on a calendar view, not involving any operation, so recording which event and what time the user referred is difficult. In order to record the user’s reference behavior exactly, we introduce a balloon-help-based function for event reference support. We ran a one-month trial of our developing prototype and confirmed our method can group related work events with acceptable accuracy. 1...|$|E
40|$|The Bayes {{error rate}} gives a {{statistical}} lower bound on the error achievable {{for a given}} classification problem and associated choice of features. By reliably estimating this rate, one can assess {{the usefulness of the}} feature set that is being used for classification. Moreover, by comparing the accuracy achieved by a given classifier with the Bayes rate, one can quantify how effective that classifier is. Classical approaches for estimating or finding bounds for the Bayes error in general yield rather weak results for small sample sizes, unless the problem has some simple characteristics such as Gaussian class-conditional likelihoods. This article shows how the outputs of a classifier ensemble can be used to provide reliable and easily obtainable estimates of the Bayes error, with negligible extra computation. Three methods of varying sophistication are described. First, we present a framework that estimates the Bayes error when multiple classifiers, each providing an estimate of the aposteriori class probabilities, are combined through averaging. Second, we bolster this approach by adding an information theoretic measure of output correlation to the estimate. Finally, we discuss a more general method that <b>just</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the class labels indicated by ensemble members and provides error estimates base...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Virtual environments are {{recognized}} as more effective than other digital approaches for the acquisition of several abilities. This is because the brain recognizes the virtual world as real and this facilitates {{the transfer of the}} newly acquired skills to the real world. In this paper, we present a game that has been designed and developed with the aim of teaching spatial orientation abilities to teenagers with mild intellectual impairments. In particular, the game focuses on the training of two basic skills: perspective taking and mental rotation. Perspective taking refers to the ability of imagining how the world looks like from another person’s point of view, while mental rotation is the ability to mentally represent and manipulate physical objects in one’s mind. The game, which takes place in a virtual environment, shows the player a scene with some objects on the table. The player has to choose among four provided alternatives, the one that shows how the scene would look like from a different side of the table. The game was first developed to be used with either a desktop pc monitor or an interactive touch table. In this case, a virtual world is represented, but the player is not completely immersed in it, he <b>just</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> the scene from outside. A second version of the same game has then been developed using a Head Mounted Display (HMD), which makes the player feel immersed in the virtual environment, where he can freely move aroun...|$|E
