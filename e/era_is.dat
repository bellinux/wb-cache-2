5|$|Although the {{liberalization}} of sexuality in American film had increased during the 1920s, the pre-Code <b>era</b> <b>is</b> either dated {{to the start of}} the sound film era, or more generally to March 1930, when the Hays Code was first written. Over the protests of NAMPI, New York became the first state to take advantage of the Supreme Court's decision in Mutual Film vs. Ohio by instituting a censorship board in 1921. Virginia followed suit the next year, and eight individual states had a board by the advent of sound film.|$|E
5|$|Between 1386 and 1572, the Polish-Lithuanian {{union was}} {{ruled by a}} {{succession}} of constitutional monarchs of the Jagiellonian dynasty. The political influence of the Jagiellonian kings gradually diminished during this period, while the landed nobility took over an ever-increasing role in central government and national affairs. The royal dynasty, however, had a stabilizing effect on Poland's politics. The Jagiellonian <b>Era</b> <b>is</b> often regarded as a period of maximum political power, great prosperity, and in its later stage, a Golden Age of Polish culture.|$|E

50|$|In 2008, the <b>ERA</b> <b>was</b> stopped {{three states}} short of ratification. The state legislatures that were most {{hostile to the}} <b>ERA</b> <b>were</b> Utah, Florida, Illinois, North Carolina and Oklahoma. The NOW {{believes}} that the single most obvious problem in passing the <b>ERA</b> <b>was</b> the gender and racial imbalance in the legislatures.

5|$|Bronze Age {{settlers}} also constructed megaliths {{at various}} sites, {{many of them}} dating from the second millennium BC, although the chambered cairns were replaced by burial cists, found on for example, Inchmarnock.

The Queen of the Inch necklace is an article of jewellery made of jet found on Bute that dates from circa 2000 BC. During the early Iron Age Brythonic culture held sway, there being no evidence that the Roman occupation of southern Scotland extended to these islands.|$|E
