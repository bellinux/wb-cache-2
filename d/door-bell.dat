25|$|For {{the series}} The Power of Five, Pentagram {{required}} five books for story development, but Horowitz completed only four: The Devil's <b>Door-bell</b> (Raven's Gate), The Night of the Scorpion (Evil Star), The Silver Citadel (Nightrise) and Day of the Dragon (Necropolis). Horowitz was clearly {{aiming for the}} same audience that read the Alex Rider novels with these rewrites, and The Power of Five has gained more public recognition than his earlier works, earning number 1 in the top 10 book chart.|$|E
25|$|Anthony Horowitz's first book, The Sinister Secret of Frederick K Bower, was {{a humorous}} {{adventure}} for children, published in 1979 and later reissued as Enter Frederick K Bower. In 1981 his second novel, Misha, the Magician and the Mysterious Amulet was published {{and he moved}} to Paris to write his third book. In 1983 {{the first of the}} Pentagram series, The Devil's <b>Door-Bell,</b> was released. This story saw Martin Hopkins battling an ancient evil that threatened the whole world. Only three of four remaining stories in the series were ever written: The Night of the Scorpion (1984), The Silver Citadel (1986) and Day of the Dragon (1986). In 1985, he released Myths and Legends, a collection of retold tales from around the world.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} of Des Esseintes is partly based on Huysmans himself, {{and the two}} share {{many of the same}} tastes, although Huysmans, on his modest civil-service salary, was hardly able to indulge them to the same extent as his upper-class hero. The writers and dandies Charles Baudelaire and Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly also had some influence, but the most important model was the notorious aristocratic aesthete Robert de Montesquiou, who was also the basis for Baron de Charlus in Marcel Proust's À la recherche du temps perdu. Montesquiou's furnishings bear a strong resemblance to those in Des Esseintes's house:In 1883, to his eternal regret, Montesquiou admitted Stéphane Mallarmé [...] It was late at night when the poet was shown over the house, and the only illumination came from a few scattered candelabra; yet in the flickering light Mallarmé observed that the <b>door-bell</b> was in fact a sacring-bell, that one room was furnished as a monastery cell and another as the cabin of a yacht, and that the third contained a Louis Quinze pulpit, three or four cathedral stalls and a strip of altar railing. He was shown, too, a sled picturesquely placed on a snow-white bearskin, a library of rare books in suitably-coloured bindings and the remains of an unfortunate tortoise whose shell had been coated with gold paint. According to Montesquiou writing many years later in his memoirs, the sight of these marvels left Mallarmé speechless with amazement. 'He went away', records Montesquiou, 'in a state of silent exaltation [...] I do not doubt therefore that it was in the most admiring, sympathetic and sincere good faith that he retailed to Huysmans what he had seen during the few moments he spent in Ali Baba's cave.' ...|$|E
60|$|DEAR MADAM,--I know I {{ought to}} respect my duty and perform it, but I am weak and faithless where boys are concerned, and I can't help {{secretly}} approving pretty bad and noisy ones, though I do {{object to the}} kind that ring <b>door-bells.</b> My family try {{to get me to}} stop the boys from holding conventions on the front steps, but I basely shirk out of it, because I think the boys enjoy it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've canoed through Canada," [...] said Ives, [...] "down many rapids {{and over}} many falls. But I didn't {{seem to get}} what I wanted out of it because I knew {{there were only two}} {{possible}} outcomes--I would either go to the bottom or arrive at the sea level. I've played all games at cards; but the mathematicians have spoiled that sport by computing the percentages. I've made acquaintances on trains, I've answered advertisements, I've rung strange <b>door-bells,</b> I've taken every chance that presented itself; but there has always been the conventional ending--the logical conclusion to the premise." ...|$|R
6000|$|The sailor awkwardly but civilly enough {{protested that}} he did not want to give so much trouble, but took the glass, and, as he put it to his lips, said formally, as if it were a toast or a kind of grace, [...] "I hope I may have the {{opportunity}} of returning the compliment." [...] The contributor thanked him; though, as he thought of all the circumstances of the case, and considered the cost at which the stranger had come to enjoy his politeness, he felt little eagerness to secure the return of the compliment at the same price, and added, with the consequence of another set phrase, [...] "Not at all." [...] But the thought had made him the more anxious to befriend the luckless soul fortune had cast in his way; and so the two sallied out together, and rang <b>door-bells</b> wherever lights were still seen burning in the windows, and asked the astonished people who answered their summons whether any Mr. Hapford were known to live in the neighborhood.|$|R
60|$|A ring at the <b>door-bell</b> {{announced}} {{the arrival of}} the first patient.|$|E
60|$|Josie {{rang the}} <b>door-bell</b> and {{presently}} {{the door was}} opened by a young and rather untidy maid.|$|E

60|$|Yet, on {{this morning}} of the day before Christmas, were these Shining Ones, moving to and fro with the crowd, whose faces were loving and serene as the {{invisible}} stars, whose robes took no defilement from the spatter and the rush of earth, whose coming and going was still as the falling snow-flakes. They entered houses without ringing <b>door-bells,</b> they passed through apartments without opening doors, and everywhere they were bearing Christ's Christmas presents, and silently offering them to whoever would open their souls to receive. Like themselves, their gifts were invisible--incapable of weight and measurement in gross earthly scales. To mourners they carried joy; to weary and perplexed hearts, peace; to souls stifling in luxury and self-indulgence they carried that noble discontent that rises to aspiration for higher things. Sometimes they took away an earthly treasure {{to make room for}} a heavenly one. They took health, but left resignation and cheerful faith. They took the babe from the dear cradle, but left in its place a heart full of pity for the suffering on earth and a fellowship with the blessed in heaven. Let us follow their footsteps awhile.|$|R
60|$|Unregenerate as I was I {{could read}} the queer {{implications}} of this speech. The present owner’s superior virtue {{as well as his}} deeper craft spoke in his reference to the late editor as one of that baser sort who deal in false representations. Mr. Deedy would as soon have sent me to call on Neil Paraday as he would have published a “holiday-number”; but such scruples presented themselves as mere ignoble thrift to his successor, whose own sincerity took the form of ringing <b>door-bells</b> and whose definition of genius was the art of finding people at home. It was as if Mr. Deedy had published reports without his young men’s having, as Pinhorn would have said, really been there. I was unregenerate, as I have hinted, and couldn’t be concerned to straighten out the journalistic morals of my chief, feeling them indeed to be an abyss over the edge of which it was better not to peer. Really to be there this time moreover was a vision that made the idea of writing something subtle about Neil Paraday only the more inspiring. I would be as considerate as even Mr. Deedy could have wished, and yet I should be as present as only Mr. Pinhorn could conceive. My allusion to the sequestered manner in which Mr. Paraday lived—it had formed part of my explanation, though I knew of it only by hearsay—was, I could divine, very much what had made Mr. Pinhorn nibble. It struck him as inconsistent with the success of his paper that any one should be so sequestered as that. And then wasn’t an immediate exposure of everything just what the public wanted? Mr. Pinhorn effectually called me to order by reminding me of the promptness with which I had met Miss Braby at Liverpool on her return from her fiasco in the States. Hadn’t we published, while its freshness and flavour were unimpaired, Miss Braby’s own version of that great international episode? I felt somewhat uneasy at this lumping of the actress and the author, and I confess that after having enlisted Mr. Pinhorn’s sympathies I procrastinated a little. I had succeeded better than I wished, and I had, as it happened, work nearer at hand. A few days later I called on Lord Crouchley and carried off in triumph the most unintelligible statement that had yet appeared of his lordship’s reasons for his change of front. I thus set in motion in the daily papers columns of virtuous verbiage. The following week I ran down to Brighton for a chat, as Mr. Pinhorn called it, with Mrs. Bounder, who gave me, on the subject of her divorce, many curious particulars that had not been articulated in court. If ever an article flowed from the primal fount it was that article on Mrs. Bounder. By this time, however, I became aware that Neil Paraday’s new book was on the point of appearing and that its approach had been the ground of my original appeal to Mr. Pinhorn, who was now annoyed with me for having lost so many days. He bundled me off—we would at least not lose another. I’ve always thought his sudden alertness a remarkable example of the journalistic instinct. Nothing had occurred, since I first spoke to him, to create a visible urgency, and no enlightenment could possibly have reached him. It was a pure case of profession flair—he had smelt the coming glory as an animal smells its distant prey.|$|R
60|$|Doctor Bronson {{dropped his}} head and paced to and fro. Then the <b>door-bell</b> rang in the {{reception}} room.|$|E

60|$|A {{sound of}} {{running on the}} gravel-walk outside and a sharp pull at the <b>door-bell</b> seemed to jerk them both to their feet.|$|E
60|$|The <b>door-bell</b> rang. He {{answered}} {{it a little}} impatiently. A slim, fashionably dressed young Frenchman stood there, whose face was vaguely familiar to him.|$|E
60|$|She {{was about}} to revert to the {{question}} of Mavering's family, when the <b>door-bell</b> rang, and another visitor interrupted her talk with Mrs. Saintsbury.|$|E
60|$|That {{night the}} young folks retired rather early. Andy and Randy were indulging in some horseplay {{in their bedroom}} {{when they heard the}} <b>door-bell</b> ring.|$|E
60|$|However, {{they arrived}} at her aunt's--a little sweet-shop in a side street. They 'pinged' the <b>door-bell,</b> and her aunt came running forward out of the kitchen.|$|E
60|$|As I rang at the <b>door-bell</b> of my employer's house, {{a thought}} {{occurred}} to me {{which might have been}} alarming to a better regulated mind than mine.|$|E

60|$|She had {{finished}} all the preparations {{she could think}} of. She sat and waited. She listened for the <b>door-bell,</b> the telephone. Her eagerness was stilled. Her hands drooped.|$|E
60|$|These {{things were}} within Mr. Jarvis Lorry's knowledge, thoughts, and notice, when he rang the <b>door-bell</b> of the {{tranquil}} {{house in the}} corner, on the fine Sunday afternoon.|$|E
60|$|A sharp pull at the <b>door-bell</b> outside {{made them}} start asunder, {{and at a}} sign from Penelope, who knew that the maids were abed by this time, he opened it.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Vivian {{had hardly}} spoken when the sharp little {{vibration}} of her <b>door-bell</b> was {{heard in the}} hall. Bernard {{stood for a moment}} looking {{at the door of the}} drawing-room.|$|E
60|$|At {{three o'clock}} the <b>door-bell</b> rang and Mary ushered in another strange person--a pretty, fair-haired young lady, this time, {{who said she}} was to give Miss Doyle lessons on the piano.|$|E
60|$|Acting on {{this view}} of his position, he took the way that led back to Slains Row, and rang the <b>door-bell</b> as became a visitor who had no reasons for {{concealment}} now.|$|E
6000|$|After {{lingering}} for a {{few minutes}} in the dusk of the bending boughs, the visitor rang the <b>door-bell,</b> and on the servant appearing, he announced himself as 'an old friend of Mrs. Downe's.' ...|$|E
60|$|Fuzzy {{rang the}} <b>door-bell,</b> smiling foolishly and dreamily. An {{atavistic}} instinct {{prompted him to}} reach for the button of his right glove. But he wore no gloves; so his left hand dropped, embarrassed.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{write to}} Mary M'Kinnon to-morrow, {{to ask about}} the chair," [...] cried Rosamond; and Raymond, hearing the <b>door-bell,</b> hurried down, to find his wife {{standing}} alone over the drawing-room fire, not very complacent.|$|E
6000|$|But {{the next}} day, as I was {{preparing}} for my afternoon's walk, the unwonted sound of our <b>door-bell</b> was heard. [...] "Is our introduction working already?" [...] thought I, little expecting the announcement--"The Misses Stympson." ...|$|E
60|$|At this moment, {{the sharp}} {{note of the}} <b>door-bell</b> rang through the house; and the visitant, as though this were some concerted signal {{for which he had}} been waiting, changed at once in his demeanour.|$|E
6000|$|... "Up, Joe, up," [...] {{she cried}} and darted across the room, leaped on a chair, and laid violent {{hands on the}} tongue of the <b>door-bell,</b> thereby {{preventing}} a furious double ring from disturbing the rosebud! ...|$|E
60|$|A sharp peal of the <b>door-bell</b> thrilled {{through the}} house, {{and as if}} {{the pull of the}} bell-wire had twitched her to her feet, Mrs. Leighton sprang up and grappled with her {{daughter}} in their common terror.|$|E
