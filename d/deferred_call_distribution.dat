40|$|We present {{first data}} on {{circadian}} long <b>call</b> <b>distribution</b> of wild orangutans in Northwest Borneo. Data were collected during {{two months in}} Batang Ai National Park. A total of 151 male long calls were heard, exhibiting a bimodal distribution pattern with peaks at 05 : 00 - 06 : 00 hours and 18 : 00 - 19 : 00 hours. An earlier study found pronounced differences between the calling rates of Bornean orangutans, which showed an almost unimodal <b>call</b> <b>distribution</b> with its peak at mid-morning, and those of Sumatran orangutans, which showed a bimodal <b>call</b> <b>distribution</b> with a distinct calling peak at predawn and a more moderate peak near dusk (MacKinnon 1974).

40|$|We present {{fundamentals}} of {{an approach to}} object-oriented specification of distributed information systems. We do not assume global time for concurrent object systems. For specifying those systems we propose Dtl, a distributed temporal logic. The main contribution is that Dtl is capable of specifying complex constraints about the behavior of distributed systems and communication between concurrent objects. For instance, we distinguish different kinds of synchronous communication such as immediate <b>calling</b> vs. <b>deferred</b> <b>calling.</b> The ideas are illustrated by examples given in Troll, a formal object-oriented specification language. We introduce notations for formally specifying object-based distributed systems. Finally, we briefly explain how Dtl is semantically {{explained in terms of}} a true concurrent model, i. e., labelled event structures, and which concepts for in-the-large specification are covered by our approach.

All techniques mentioned above are designed for applications running across multiple domains (e. g., multiple processes or multiple nodes in a network). In these techniques, multiple operations are bundled together and then sent to a different domain, where they are executed.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{bandwidth}} allocation scheme which improves degradation of communication quality due to handoffs in mobile multimedia networks. In general, a multimedia call consists of several component calls. For example, a video phone call {{consists of a}} voice call and a video call. In realistic environments, each component call included in one multimedia call may have different requirements for quality-of-service (QoS) from each other, and priorities among these component calls often exist with respect to importance for communications. When the available bandwidth {{is not enough for}} a handoff call, the proposed scheme eliminates a low priority component <b>call</b> and <b>defers</b> bandwidth allocation for a component call whose delay related QoS is not strict. Moreover, in the allocation, the scheme gives priority to new calls and handoff <b>calls</b> over a <b>deferred</b> <b>call</b> and also performs bandwidth reallocation to eliminated component calls. By computer simulation, we evaluate the performance such as call dropping probability and show effectiveness of the proposed scheme...|$|R
