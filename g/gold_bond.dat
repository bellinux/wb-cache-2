5|$|Secret Service {{operative}} James Bond, {{code name}} 007, {{is assigned to}} apprehend a hero of the Second World War implicated in a murder involving a cache of Nazi <b>gold.</b> <b>Bond</b> appears only briefly in this story, which is told mostly in flashback {{from the perspective of}} Major Dexter Smythe, the man Bond has been sent to bring in. Smythe remained in Europe after the war, found the gold {{with the help of a}} mountain guide, and killed him in order to keep it for himself. Bond was put on the case after the guide's body fell out of a glacier and he recognized the man as a ski instructor and father figure from his youth. Smythe is now a melancholy alcoholic living alone on the beach, interacting mainly with the residents of its coral reef – including the titular Octopussy, a beloved 'pet' octopus that Smythe feeds and talks to.|$|E
5|$|Whilst {{changing}} {{planes in}} Miami after closing down a Mexican heroin smuggling operation, British Secret Service operative James Bond is asked by Junius Du Pont, a rich American businessman (whom he briefly met and gambled with in Casino Royale), to watch Auric Goldfinger, with whom Du Pont is playing Canasta {{in order to}} discover if he is cheating. Bond quickly realises that Goldfinger is indeed cheating {{with the aid of}} his female assistant, Jill Masterton, who is spying on DuPont's cards. Bond blackmails Goldfinger into admitting it and paying back DuPont's lost money; he also has a brief affair with Masterton. Back in London, Bond's superior, M, tasks him with determining how Goldfinger is smuggling gold out of the country: M also suspects Goldfinger of being connected to SMERSH and financing their western networks with his <b>gold.</b> <b>Bond</b> visits the Bank of England for a briefing with Colonel Smithers on the methods of gold smuggling.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, Good Humor was {{acquired}} by Thomas J. Lipton, the U.S. subsidiary of the international Unilever conglomerate. Profits declined when the baby boomers aged and costs increased because of labor issues, gasoline, and insurance. The company sold its fleet in 1978 but continued to distribute its products through grocery stores and independent street vendors. By 1984, Good Humor returned to profitability. Starting in 1989, Unilever expanded Good Humor through its acquisition of <b>Gold</b> <b>Bond</b> Ice Cream that included the Popsicle brand. Four years later, Unilever bought Isaly Klondike and the Breyers Ice Cream Company. As a result, Good Humor-Breyers is now a large producer of branded ice cream and frozen novelties, {{as part of the}} Unilever Heartbrand.|$|E
50|$|The {{railroad}} had {{at least}} $200,000 in capital at their disposal, which came {{at least in part}} from 150 <b>gold</b> <b>bonds</b> issued around 1885 that were signed by the company president D.M. Pyle and the company secretary. These <b>gold</b> <b>bonds</b> expired twenty years later, but the railroad ran into financial troubles as soon as 1886. Notably, the Southern Pacific Railroad and Peninsular Railway began service on the Mayfield Cutoff in 1908, just three years after the <b>gold</b> <b>bonds</b> expired.|$|R

Punk and Cabana became best friends and spent most of their early career together working in the same independent promotions, as both opponents and tag team partners. In the independents, along with fellow Steel Domain graduates Colt Cabana, Chucke E. Smooth, Adam Pearce, and manager Dave Prazak, Punk formed an alliance named the <b>Gold</b> <b>Bond</b> Mafia.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the trucks}} sold, Good Humor {{focused on the}} grocery division, and the company {{returned}} to profitability by 1984. Unilever, the world's largest marketer of ice cream products, decided to achieve a similar market position in the U.S, through acquisitions. In 1989, Unilever purchased <b>Gold</b> <b>Bond</b> Ice Cream of Green Bay, Wisconsin, which owned Popsicle. In 1993, Unilever bought Isaly Klondike, maker of another chocolate-coated ice cream bar invented in Youngstown in the early 1920s. Also in 1993, Unilever acquired the Breyers Ice Cream Company and combined these operations into the renamed Good Humor-Breyers. [...] Since 2000, Good Humor {{has been one of}} numerous Unilever ice cream subsidiaries to use the international Heartbrand for its logo. It removed the Heartbrand in 2009 but brought it back as part of its logo from 2014 onwards.|$|E

And you see in his private room, with the door open, the secretary and treasurer, Mr. Buckingham Skinner, costumed like the lilies of the conservatory, with his high silk hat close to his hand. Nobody yet ever saw Buck outside of an instantaneous reach for his hat.|$|E
60|$|When any {{stockholder}} {{had paid}} {{in as much}} as $100, the company issued him a <b>Gold</b> <b>Bond</b> and he became a bondholder. I asked Atterbury one day what benefits and appurtenances these Gold Bonds was to an investor more so than the immunities and privileges enjoyed by the common sucker who only owned stock. Atterbury picked up one of them Gold Bonds, all gilt and lettered up with flourishes and a big red seal tied with a blue ribbon in a bowknot, {{and he looked at me}} like his feelings was hurt.|$|E
60|$|Atterbury {{attended}} {{to the details}} of the concern. As I understand it, they was simple. The investors in stock paid in their money, and-- well, I guess that's all they had to do. The company received it, and --I don't call to mind anything else. Me and Buck knew more about selling corn salve than we did about Wall Street, but even we could see how the Golconda <b>Gold</b> <b>Bond</b> Investment Company was making money. You take in money and pay back ten per cent. of it; it's plain enough that you make a clean, legitimate profit of 90 per cent., less expenses, as long as the fish bite.|$|E

50|$|Agriculture Minister Hans Luther {{proposed}} {{a plan that}} substituted gold for rye {{and led to the}} issuance of the Rentenmark ("mortgage mark"), backed by bonds indexed to the market price of <b>gold.</b> The <b>gold</b> <b>bonds</b> were defined at the rate of 2790 gold marks per kilogram of gold, the same as the prewar gold marks. Rentenmarks were not redeemable in gold but only indexed to the <b>gold</b> <b>bonds.</b> The plan was adopted in monetary reform decrees, on October 13-15, 1923. A new bank, the Rentenbank, was set up and controlled by new German Finance Minister Hans Luther.|$|R

60|$|The {{next day}} me and Buck comes {{down from the}} hotel about ten-thirty. On the way we buys the papers, {{and the first thing}} we see is a column on the front page about our little imposition. It was a shame the way that {{reporter}} intimated that we were no blood relatives of the late George W. Childs. He tells all about the scheme as he sees it, in a rich, racy kind of a guying style that might amuse most anybody except a stockholder. Yes, Atterbury was right; it behooveth the gaily clad treasurer and the pearly pated president and the rugged vice-president of the Golconda <b>Gold</b> <b>Bond</b> and Investment Company to go away real sudden and quick that their days might be longer upon the land.|$|E
60|$|Buck {{takes off}} his coat, pushes his silk hat {{on the back of}} his head, and lights up a reina victoria. He sets at the table with the boodle before him, all done up in neat packages. I gets the {{stockholders}} strung out and marches 'em, single file, through from the main room; and the reporter man passes 'em out of the side door into the hall again. As they go by, Buck takes up the stock and the Gold Bonds, paying 'em cash, dollar for dollar, the same as they paid in. The shareholders of the Golconda <b>Gold</b> <b>Bond</b> and Investment Company can't hardly believe it. They almost grabs the money out of Buck's hands. Some of the women keep on crying, for it's a custom of the sex to cry when they have sorrow, to weep when they have joy, and to shed tears whenever they find themselves without either.|$|E

Grain average misorientation (GAM) and scalar orientation spread (SOS) of the component in copper and <b>gold</b> <b>bonding</b> wires are {{lower than those of}} the or other orientations. The bonding wires experience three stages of microstructural changes during annealing. The first stage is subgrain growth to keep elongated grain shapes overall and to be varied in aspect ratio with annealing time. The grain sizes of the and components increase during annealing. The volume fraction of the component increases whereas that of the decreases. The second stage is recrystallization, during which equiaxed grains appear and coexist with elongated ones. The third stage is grain growth which eliminates the elongated grains and enlarges equiaxed grains. The and grains compete with each other and the grains grow faster than the grains during the third stage...|$|R
