500|$|Halo 3 {{was officially}} {{announced}} via a cinematic trailer rendered in real-time, shown at Microsoft's press conference at E3 2006 on May 9. The trailer {{is set in}} the dry plains of Africa, with the ruins of a space elevator and other damage visible. The Master Chief is slowly revealed walking through smoke and dust, occasionally obscured by distorted images of the artificial intelligence Cortana transmitting a message composed of portions of the character's lines in the Cortana Letters, as well as a line from the poem [...] "The Hollow Men". The distorted voice of Cortana was a deliberate clue to the character's predicament in Halo 3, with a Bungie staff member stating, [...] "We don't know what has happened to her...We don't know it's Cortana. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> sort of bizarre, almost Satanic sort of voice. Something seems wrong." [...] The trailer featured music by Martin O'Donnell, {{with the addition of a}} piano and brass section to the classic Halo theme.|$|E

2500|$|The {{distinction}} of Celtic into these four sub-families most likely occurred about 900 BC according to Gray and Atkinson but, because of estimation uncertainty, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> time between 1200 and 800 BC. However, they only considered Gaelic and Brythonic. The controversial paper by Forster and Toth included Gaulish {{and put the}} break-up much earlier at 3200 BC ± 1500 years. They support the Insular Celtic hypothesis. The early Celts were commonly associated with the archaeological Urnfield culture, the Hallstatt culture, and the La Tène culture, though the earlier assumption of association between language and culture is now considered to be less strong.r ...|$|E

60|$|Of the captives {{taken in}} the camp, many were most cruelly treated, their eyes put out, and their hands cut off; others were imprisoned, and many slain. Morkar, who was here taken, {{spent the rest of}} his life in the same captivity as Ulfnoth, Stigand, and many other Saxons of distinction, with the one gleam of hope when liberated at William's death, and then the bitter {{disappointment}} of renewed seizure and captivity. If <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>any</b> consolation to them, these Saxons were not William's only captives. Bishop Odo, of Bayeux, whom William had made Earl of Kent, after giving a great deal of trouble to his brother the king, and to Archbishop Lanfranc, by his avarice and violence, heard a prediction that the next Pope should be named Odo, and set off to try to bring about its fulfilment in his own person, carrying with him an immense quantity of ill-gotten treasure, and a large number of troops, commanded by Hugh the Wolf, Earl of Chester.|$|E
