25|$|E: As I lay in {{bed that}} night, <b>I</b> <b>overheard</b> the three doctors tell my parents {{in the other room}} that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up {{against the side of the}} bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser I could see through the doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If I had any skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E
500|$|Rowling {{has named}} {{communist}} {{and civil rights}} activist Jessica Mitford as her [...] "most influential writer" [...] saying, [...] "Jessica Mitford has been my heroine since I was 14 years old, when <b>I</b> <b>overheard</b> my formidable great-aunt discussing how Mitford had run away {{at the age of}} 19 to fight with the Reds in the Spanish Civil War", and claims what inspired her about Mitford was that she was [...] "incurably and instinctively rebellious, brave, adventurous, funny and irreverent, she liked nothing better than a good fight, preferably against a pompous and hypocritical target". Rowling has described Jane Austen as her favourite author, calling Emma her favourite book in O, The Oprah Magazine. As a child, Rowling has said her early influences included The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis, The Little White Horse by Elizabeth Goudge, and Manxmouse by Paul Gallico.|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} [...] "Compass Point", a song Frankel wrote in 45 minutes, is a {{reference}} to Chris Blackwell's Compass Point Studios, where numerous popular musicians in the style mixture of funk, reggae and synthpop, that Crime Cutz pays a tribute to, recorded their music. Its working title was [...] "Back to Earth", {{and was the first}} song to be written for but was not included on their second studio album Dynamics. As Millhiser explains, [...] "There was always some indescribable thing about it that irked us, so we went back to that song with the intention of being like, 'Oh, you know, it’s just a matter of re-recording the vocals or the piano, and it’ll be done.' That of course was not the case, and we ended basically just keeping the drums and one line from the song, making a totally different song out of it, essentially remixing ourselves." [...] Frankel called the EP's closer, [...] "Footsteps", to be the least rhythmic of all the tracks. Its original title was [...] "Your Favorite Band/Footsteps". As Frankel described coming up with the name, [...] "I was going the other night to see our friends in Hot Chip. When I was there, <b>I</b> <b>overheard</b> some people saying, 'I thought they were playing, but they’re DJing,' and that’s something that happens all the time now. People go to see their favorite band, and it turns out it’s a DJ set. I thought it was kind of funny, and also kind of sad — but in a funny way." [...] While the version of Crime Cutz that was officially released only consists of four tracks, Holy Ghost! said in their January 2016 announcement of the EP that a fifth track might be included; [...] "We’re still messing around, because {{we have a lot of}} demos from this last year and a half, and we’re sifting through, figuring out if there’s one more we want to finish." ...|$|E

60|$|We moved {{cautiously}} now, {{warned by}} the fragment of conversation <b>I</b> had <b>overheard.</b> <b>I</b> kept abreast of Woola {{that we might}} have the benefit of all our eyes for what might appear suddenly ahead to menace us, and well it was that we were forewarned.|$|R
60|$|I {{repeated}} the conversation between Drew and Mr. Trevor which <b>I</b> had <b>overheard.</b> Farrar whistled.|$|R
2500|$|... {{had done}} it out of spite for her {{rejection}} of his love. I am certain, however, {{that he did it}} to punish the twisted personality of an artist who would {{go so far as to}} burn a carriage and kill a human being to complete the painting of a screen. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>overheard</b> His Lordship saying as much himself”.|$|E
2500|$|In the Scotsman interview, Rowling {{described}} {{civil rights}} activist Jessica Mitford as [...] "my most influential writer", saying, [...] "I love the way she never outgrew some of her adolescent traits, remaining true to her politics – she was a self-taught socialist – throughout her life." [...] In a review of Decca—The letters of Jessica Mitford, she went further saying, [...] "Jessica Mitford has been my heroine since I was 14 years old, when <b>I</b> <b>overheard</b> my formidable great-aunt discussing how Mitford had run away {{at the age of}} 19 to fight with the Reds in the Spanish Civil War", and claims what inspired her about Mitford was that she was [...] "incurably and instinctively rebellious, brave, adventurous, funny and irreverent, she liked nothing better than a good fight, preferably against a pompous and hypocritical target." ...|$|E

60|$|That strange {{outburst}} encouraged me. I risked {{letting her}} know that <b>I</b> had <b>overheard</b> her last words.|$|R
60|$|Under {{ordinary}} circumstances I {{should have}} taken the speech for badinage--it {{was the kind of}} wit the woman would have indulged in. But Cyril's face clouded with anger and vexation. I said nothing. I did not wish him to know that <b>I</b> had <b>overheard.</b> <b>I</b> tried to believe that he was amusing himself, but my own explanation did not satisfy me.|$|R
6000|$|... "In reply, I {{informed}} {{her of the}} conversation <b>I</b> had <b>overheard.</b> The recital shocked and distressed her. 'Alas!' cried she, 'then is our happiness at an end!' ...|$|R

60|$|When from my bath {{next morning}} <b>I</b> <b>overheard</b> Mr. Kindheart and the {{upholsterer}} in {{conference on the}} top of an echoing staircase; and when <b>I</b> <b>overheard</b> Mr. Kindheart rendering English Undertaking phrases into very choice Italian, and the upholsterer replying in the unknown Tongues; and when I furthermore remembered that the local funerals had no resemblance to English funerals; I became in my secret bosom apprehensive. But Mr. Kindheart informed me at breakfast that measures had been taken to ensure a signal success.|$|E

60|$|I lost no time {{in telling}} her what <b>I</b> had <b>overheard</b> the night before, and that the detective was gone from his tent. She stopped her packing {{and looked at me}} in concern.|$|R
6000|$|And in a rapid manner I told Dick of what <b>I</b> had <b>overheard,</b> omitting the {{mentioning}} of my father's and Mr. Woodward's names. Of {{course he}} was tremendously excited. What healthy country boy would not be? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, no; {{it was the}} footsteps, Miss Granger, and the gossip, and the {{appointment}} you made in the churchyard, that <b>I</b> unwillingly <b>overheard,</b> not the gossip alone which led me into my mistake. Of course I have now to apologise." ...|$|R
