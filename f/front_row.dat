5|$|After the {{kick-off}} {{there was}} soon a scrum ordered The All Blacks were repeatedly penalised by the referee whenever {{they had a}} scrum. The reason for this was the All Blacks 2–3–2 scrum formation where they had only two front-rowers. The Welsh team used a three-man <b>front</b> <b>row,</b> and had studied the All Blacks scrummaging technique. The Welsh countered the All Blacks 2–3–2 scrum formation by setting their <b>front</b> <b>row</b> after the All Blacks, and hence preventing the All Blacks from gaining the loosehead. Consequently, every time the All Blacks tried to hook the ball they were penalised, and this prompted their captain Gallaher to order his team not to contest the scrums, and to instead let the Welsh win the ball.|$|E
5|$|Nevin's {{intensity}} {{almost got}} the best of him during a June 1993 game with Tucson. He was taunted by a man seated in the <b>front</b> <b>row,</b> and nearly attempted to jump into the stands to confront the fan before he was restrained by teammates. The fan was arrested.|$|E
2500|$|To form a scrum the two forward packs {{approach}} to within an arms length of each other. The referee gives the command crouch and the opposing <b>front</b> <b>rows</b> then crouch {{so that their}} backs are {{parallel to the ground}} and their head and shoulders are no lower than their hips. Then the referee calls bind and [...] "using their outside arm each prop binds onto the point of the opposing prop’s outside shoulder." [...] This command is to ensure that the two <b>front</b> <b>rows</b> are not too far apart. Finally the referee then says set (this is not a command, but rather permission to the <b>front</b> <b>rows</b> to engage) and the two <b>front</b> <b>rows</b> come together. When this happens both <b>front</b> <b>rows</b> thrust forward with the tighthead props heads going between the opposing hooker and loosehead prop. The props then bind by gripping the back or side of the opposing prop's jersey.|$|R

5|$|During the session, {{in where}} drivers ran in packs and drafted off each other, Juan Pablo Montoya {{made contact with}} Kahne and sent his car {{spinning}} into the grass on the front stretch, tearing off some of its nose. Kahne was required to use a backup car {{for the rest of}} Speedweeks. Because the qualifying grids were chosen by the order in which drivers qualified in Daytona 500 pole position qualifying, the pole was given to Carl Edwards in the first race and to Biffle in the second. Edwards was joined on the grid's <b>front</b> <b>row</b> by Dale Earnhardt, Jr., with Ambrose in third. Stenhouse and Bayne started in fourth and fifth positions respectively. Biffle was joined by Mears on the <b>front</b> <b>row</b> for the second race, with Jeff Gordon in third. Martin Truex, Jr. started fourth, and was followed by Martin in fifth.|$|E

On the “bind” call the props will position their arms in the correct ‘bind’ position current Law 20.1 (g) outlines the correct bind. The <b>front</b> <b>rows</b> (+ back 5 players) will tighten binds and set themselves for the throw-in. The ball is then thrown-in without delay as per Law 20.5.|$|R
5|$|Forty-nine {{cars were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier, {{although}} due to NASCAR's qualifying procedure only forty-three could race. Gilliland clinched his first career pole position {{with a time of}} 49.950 seconds and was joined on the grid's <b>front</b> <b>row</b> by Jarrett, his Robert Yates Racing teammate.

5|$|Guillemin was {{selected}} for an international match between the best of London {{and the best of}} Paris, played at Stade de France on 12 March.

The audience saw Fox step out of character - that of French statesman Charles de Gaulle - and chastise the heckler with robust language.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007 the scrum law was {{amended to}} a four-step, [...] "crouch", [...] "touch", [...] "pause", [...] "engage" [...] process {{in an attempt}} to control scrum engagement. Prior to this, there was no {{obligation}} for each prop to touch the opposing props shoulder, and the distance between the two <b>front</b> <b>rows</b> was often larger. The new rule fixed the distance between the <b>front</b> <b>rows</b> and as a result cut the force of impact from the engagement. The reason for the rule change was {{to reduce the number of}} serious neck injuries to front rowers.|$|R

50|$|The two forward packs form a scrum by {{approaching}} {{to within}} an arms length of each other. The referee gives the command crouch and the opposing <b>front</b> <b>rows</b> then crouch. Then the referee calls touch and props touch the opposites outside shoulder. The referee then issues the set command {{which indicates that}} the two packs may come together. When this happens both <b>front</b> <b>rows</b> thrust forward with the tighthead props' heads going between the opposing hooker and loosehead prop. The props then bind by gripping the back or side of the opposing prop's jersey. The scrum-half from the team that has possession then throws {{the ball in the}} gap formed between the two <b>front</b> <b>rows.</b> The two hookers (and sometimes the props) then compete for possession by trying to hook the ball backwards with their feet, while the entire pack tries to push the opposing pack backwards. The side that wins possession usually transfers the ball {{to the back of the}} scrum — which is done with their feet. Once at the back it is picked up either by the number 8, or by the scrum-half.|$|R
