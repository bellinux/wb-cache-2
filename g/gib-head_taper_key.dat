50|$|The <b>tapered</b> <b>key</b> is <b>tapered</b> only on {{the side}} that engages the hub. The keyway in the hub has a taper that matches that of the <b>tapered</b> <b>key.</b> Some <b>taper</b> <b>keys</b> have a gib, or tab, for easier removal during disassembly. The purpose of the taper is to secure the key itself, as well as, to firmly engage the shaft to the hub {{without the need for}} a set screw. The problem with <b>taper</b> <b>keys</b> is that they can cause the center of the shaft {{rotation}} to be slightly off of the mating part. It is different from a tapered shaft lock in that <b>tapered</b> <b>keys</b> have a matching taper on the keyway, while tapered shaft locks do not.|$|R

50|$|Piston rods {{are usually}} {{attached}} to the crosshead and the piston by a transverse slot and a <b>tapered</b> <b>key</b> or gib. Driving this key sideways tightens the attachment. Using a transverse key allows relatively easy dismantling for maintenance. Some smaller pistons are retained by a threaded piston rod and a large nut, although the crosshead nearly always uses a key.|$|R
50|$|Sprockets {{are used}} in the {{conveyor}} system to drive the chain. Conveyor sprockets typically have an odd number of teeth although sprockets with an even number have become more prevalent over the last thirty years. Most sprockets are made from fabricated steel and are parallel or <b>taper</b> <b>keyed</b> to a through shaft. Conveyor sprockets are also available in double pitch and shear pin varieties. Double pitch sprockets wear evenly and offer a longer service life than standard sprockets. Shear pin sprockets break when overloaded, stopping the conveyor and saving considerable expense and downtime.|$|R

40|$|Interference fits {{are widely}} {{employed}} to semi-permanently connect gears, pulleys, flanges, wheels, disks, rotors, and similar mechanical components, to a shaft. The stress state along the hub central portion may be thoroughly predicted by modelling the press-fit problem as plane and by employing the Lamé equations for thick-walled cylinders, and the transmissible torque may be confidently estimated {{by relying on}} the Lamé predictions, since they are valid along most of the contact axial length. 	Often a key {{is added to the}} press-fit, to secure the torque transmission and to prevent any relative rotation between the shaft and the hub. Both parallel and <b>tapered</b> <b>keys</b> are employed in practical applications. With respect to their <b>tapered</b> counterparts, parallel <b>keys</b> possess the advantage that they do not cause any eccentricity. This study considers parallel keys only. The presence of the keyseat increases the compliance of the hub and the shaft, thus producing a diminution of the contact pressure between the hub and the shaft, which results in a similar diminution of the transmissible torque. In this paper, a preliminary Finite Element analysis is carried out to quantify the above diminution of the contact pressure in the assumption of frictionless contact. The analysis is carried out for a solid shaft and for a practically relevant selection of ratios between the hub inner and outer radii. 	A preliminary development is presented of an analytical approach based upon the classical Michell polar solution, which is particularly suitable to mimic rings. 	The diminution of the transmissible torque with respect to a keyless shaft-hub press-fit is quantified, and the results are presented in a design diagram...|$|R
50|$|Sleeve {{couplings}} {{are also}} known as Box Couplings. In this case shaft ends are coupled together and abutted against each other which are enveloped by muff or sleeve. A gib head sunk keys hold the two shafts and sleeve together.in other words,this is the simplest type of the coupling. It is made from the cast iron and very simple to design and manufacture. It consists of a hollow pipe whose inner diameter is same as diameter of the shafts.The hollow pipe is fitted over a two or more ends of the shafts {{with the help of}} the <b>taper</b> sunk <b>key.</b> A key and sleeve are useful to transmit power from one shaft to another shaft.|$|R
40|$|Spot size {{converters}} (waveguide <b>tapers)</b> are <b>key</b> {{elements for}} photonic integrated circuits (PICs) since they {{significantly reduce the}} effort and cost of the device packaging. In comparison to other technologies like micro lenses or lensed fibres the implementation of spot size converters can also reduce the optical insertion loss of the devices. The basic technological challenge is the fabrication of a vertical ramp with a maximum height of around 1 mu m and a length of 500 - 1000 mu m. Several approaches to form this ramp have been reported including shadow mask etching, shadow mask epitaxy and selective area growth. All this methods have in common that they require special processes which are rather complicated, expensive and inflexible in terms of tailoring of the ramp profile. In this paper, we present a novel method for the fabrication of spot size converters which can produce almost arbitrary taper profiles and requires only standard lithography and etching processes and can therefore easily be implemented into standard waveguide processes...|$|R

40|$|A {{new species}} of the pardaliscid amphipod, Nicippe recticaudata, from off Cape Toi, Japan, is named and described. This is the first record of Nicippe Bruzelius, 1859 from the western Pacific coast of the Japanese archipelago. Additionally, {{nucleotide}} sequences of nuclear 28 S ribosomal RNA and histone H 3 as well as mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and 16 S ribosomal RNA from the holotype and paratypes were determined. The morphological characteristics and the COI distance values enforced the distinctiveness of N. recticaudata sp. n. among the known Nicippe species. Nicippe recticaudata sp. n. closely resembles N. tumida Bruzelius, 1859 in having a two-dentate posterior margin of usoromite 1. However, the former is distinguished from the latter by the posterior margin of merus of pereopod 4 with 5 – 6 setae, anterior margin of merus of pereopod 5 with 9 – 10 setae, and telson with straight inner margin, <b>tapering</b> proximally.

50|$|Exors of James Mills were {{manufacturers}} of steel products for over 100 years, the company growing {{from a small}} building employing two men to the large Bredbury Steelworks on Lower Bents Lane, which at its height employed over 2,000 people. In {{the early part of}} the 20th century, the company began to roll steel and to produce bright steel, at one point becoming the largest producer of bright steel outside the United States. Other products were added from time to time, including cotters for locomotives and rolling stock, engineer's <b>keys,</b> <b>taper</b> pins, grooved fastenings for securing all kinds of assemblies, railway permanent way fastenings, rail lubricators and hot pressings of various types. In 1938 the company introduced lead-bearing steels to the United Kingdom, and in the 1960s developed free machining steels containing tellurium and an alloy replacement steel. The company was later acquired by GKN and closed down in 1985. The site has since been redeveloped for housing.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to use computational modeling to study the deformation of single cells subjected to mechanical stresses. Our motivation stems from experimental observations that cells are subjected to mechanical stresses arising from their environment throughout their lifetime, and that such stresses can regulate many important biological processes. While the exact mechanotransduction mechanisms involved are not well understood, quantitative models for cell deformation can yield important insights. In this thesis, we developed an axisymmetric finite element model to study the deformation of suspended fibroblasts in the optical stretcher and neutrophils in <b>tapered</b> micropipettes. The <b>key</b> feature of our model {{is the use of}} a viscoelastic constitutive equation whose parameters can be varied both spatially and temporally so as to mimic the experimentally-observed spatio-temporal heterogeneity of cellular material properties. Our model suggested that cellular remodeling, {{in the form of an}} increased cellular viscosity, occurred during optical stretching of fibroblasts. The increase would have to be approximately 20 -fold to explain the experimental data for different loading time-scales. We also showed that cell size is a more important factor in determining the strain response of the optically-stretched fibroblasts compared to the thickness of the actin cortical region. This result can explain the higher optical deformability observed experimentally for malignant fibroblasts. In addition, our simulations showed that maximal stress propagates into the nuclear region for malignant fibroblasts whereas for normal fibroblasts, the maximal stress does not. Finally, results from modeling the tapered micropipette experiments also suggested that cellular remodeling, in the form of a decreased cellular elasticity and viscosity, occurred during the process of neutrophil aspiration. Taken together, our simulation results on optically-stretched fibroblasts and aspirated neutrophils suggested that cells in general are able to sense mechanical stresses and respond by varying their material properties during deformation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Giant-cell {{arteritis}} commonly relapses when glucocorticoids are tapered, and {{the prolonged}} use of glucocorticoids {{is associated with}} side effects. The effect of the interleukin- 6 receptor alpha inhibitor tocilizumab on the rates of relapse during glucocorticoid tapering was studied in patients with giant-cell arteritis. METHODS: In this 1 -year trial, we randomly assigned 251 patients, in a 2 : 1 : 1 : 1 ratio, to receive subcutaneous tocilizumab (at a dose of 162 mg) weekly or every other week, combined with a 26 -week prednisone taper, or placebo combined with a prednisone taper {{over a period of}} either 26 weeks or 52 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of sustained glucocorticoid-free remission at week 52 in each tocilizumab group as compared with the rate in the placebo group that underwent the 26 -week prednisone <b>taper.</b> The <b>key</b> secondary outcome was the rate of remission in each tocilizumab group as compared with the placebo group that underwent the 52 -week prednisone taper. Dosing of prednisone and safety were also assessed. RESULTS: Sustained remission at week 52 occurred in 56 % of the patients treated with tocilizumab weekly and in 53 % of those treated with tocilizumab every other week, as compared with 14 % of those in the placebo group that underwent the 26 -week prednisone taper and 18 % of those in the placebo group that underwent the 52 -week prednisone taper (P< 0. 001 for the comparisons of either active treatment with placebo). The cumulative median prednisone dose over the 52 -week period was 1862 mg in each tocilizumab group, as compared with 3296 mg in the placebo group that underwent the 26 -week taper (P< 0. 001 for both comparisons) and 3818 mg in the placebo group that underwent the 52 -week taper (P< 0. 001 for both comparisons). Serious adverse events occurred in 15 % of the patients in the group that received tocilizumab weekly, 14 % of those in the group that received tocilizumab every other week, 22 % of those in the placebo group that underwent the 26 -week taper, and 25 % of those in the placebo group that underwent the 52 -week taper. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy developed in one patient in the group that received tocilizumab every other week. CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab, received weekly or every other week, combined with a 26 -week prednisone taper was superior to either 26 -week or 52 -week prednisone tapering plus placebo with regard to sustained glucocorticoid-free remission in patients with giant-cell arteritis. Longer follow-up is necessary to determine the durability of remission and safety of tocilizumab. (Funded by F. Hoffmann-La Roche; ClinicalTrials. gov number, NCT 01791153.) ...|$|R
