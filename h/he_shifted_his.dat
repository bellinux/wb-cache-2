At the 2006 Winter Paralympics in Torino, Bor served as an Australian assistant coach. In 2009, following those Games, <b>he</b> <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> role to serve as Melissa Perrine's guide as Perrine advanced further in the sport. He first skied with Perrine at a World Cup event in January 2010 where they finished fourth.|$|E
5|$|Florian Witold Znaniecki (15 January 1882– 23 March 1958) was a Polish {{philosopher and}} {{sociologist}} who taught and wrote in Poland {{and in the}} United States. Over {{the course of his}} work <b>he</b> <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> focus from philosophy to sociology. He remains a major figure in the history of Polish and American sociology; the founder of Polish academic sociology, and of an entire school of thought in sociology. He won international renown as co-author, with William I. Thomas, of the study, The Polish Peasant in Europe and America (1918–20), which is considered the foundation of modern empirical sociology. He also made major contributions to sociological theory, introducing terms such as humanistic coefficient and culturalism.|$|E

5|$|The {{massacre}} and Gandhi's non-violent {{response to}} it moved many, but also made some Sikhs and Hindus upset that Dyer was getting away with murder. Investigation committees were formed by the British, which Gandhi asked Indians to boycott. The unfolding events, the massacre and the British response, led Gandhi {{to the belief that}} Indians will never get a fair equal treatment under British rulers, and <b>he</b> <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> attention to Swaraj or self rule and political independence for India. In 1921, Gandhi was the leader of the Indian National Congress. He reorganised the Congress. With Congress now behind him, and Muslim support triggered by his backing the Khilafat movement to restore the Caliph in Turkey, Gandhi had the political support and the attention of the British Raj.|$|E
5|$|While Roberts had {{a natural}} talent for riding {{motorcycles}} on dirt surfaces, on paved road circuits, the motorcycle felt unsettled beneath him while negotiating a turn. During a race at the Ontario Motor Speedway, he observed Finnish rider Jarno Saarinen using a riding style where <b>he</b> <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> body weight towards {{the inside of}} a turn. Roberts tried the technique and found that it helped settle the motorcycle. He adopted the cornering style and exaggerated the body shift {{to a greater extent than}} Saarinen had by extending his knee out until it skimmed the track surface. With his new riding technique, Roberts began to excel in road race events. Yamaha motorcycles performed very well in road racing, where the Yamaha TZ750 was the dominant motorcycle of the era.|$|E
5|$|In Salinas, Genevevo Salinas of Houston had voluntarily gone to {{a police}} station when {{officers}} asked him to accompany them {{to talk about the}} murder of two men. Salinas answered most of the officers' questions, but simply remained silent when they asked him whether shotgun casings found {{at the scene of the}} murders would match his gun. <b>He</b> <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> feet, and otherwise acted nervously, but did not say anything. Later, at his trial, prosecutors told jurors that his silence in the face of that question showed that he was guilty, that he knew that the shotgun used to kill the victims was his. Salinas' lawyer wanted the Supreme Court to rule that the simple fact of silence during police questioning, when an individual was not under arrest, could not be used against that person at a criminal trial.|$|E

25|$|Scaife gained notoriety for evading weak {{campaign}} finance laws to donate US$990,000 to the 1972 re-election campaign of U.S. President Richard M. Nixon. Scaife was not charged with a crime, but about $45,000 went to a fund linked to the Watergate scandal. Scaife later said he was repulsed by the scandal and refused to speak with Nixon after 1973. Following Duggan's suicide and then Watergate, <b>he</b> <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> political giving from politicians' campaigns to anti-communist research groups, legal defense funds, and publications.|$|E
25|$|The {{films that}} he made next were overtly political, and earned him the {{reputation}} as a Marxist artist. This was also the time of large-scale political unrest throughout India. Particularly in and around Calcutta, this period underwent what {{is now known as}} the Naxalite movement. This phase was immediately followed by a series of films where <b>he</b> <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> focus, and instead of looking for enemies outside, he looked for the enemy within his own middle class society. This was arguably his most creative phase.|$|E

However, the Ottoman defenders put up a stiff resistance, and the attack by the 18th Brigade bogged down. Despite the enfilading fire from the gunboats along the river, Fry's forces could not break through the Ottoman defenders. Fry sent word requesting Delamain's help.

25|$|He {{wanted to}} be an artist or illustrator, but he was often {{discouraged}} by societal norms of Japan which favored finding safe, well-paying jobs. He was discouraged because his uncle was an artist who suffered from financial difficulties. Another reason was his father's death which left his family more financially tight. He eventually started writing short stories and began to send them to Japanese magazines but was not able to get anything published. He cites that his stories were often 400 pages long while most magazines wanted their short stories to be around 100 pages. Eventually, <b>he</b> <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> focus to making films with his friend who had an 8mm camera.|$|E

25|$|In 1946–47, Dr. Hopper {{served on}} the site {{selection}} board for the new United States Air Force Academy. Upon his return to academia in 1947, he found himself passed over for promotion above associate professor. The classified nature of most of Hopper’s research output did not help his prospects, {{as well as the}} extended time he spent away from academia with the military, two years more than most of his colleagues. Post war <b>he</b> <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> teaching interests more towards air power as a factor in international affairs and did not become significantly involved in the new Russian Research Center, known today as the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies.|$|E
25|$|After high school, Hess {{attended}} Brooklyn College. Initially, {{he studied}} medicine. However, within a year, <b>he</b> <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> focus to arts and began painting. He {{then moved to}} Europe where he traveled widely, studying the paintings in museum collections. He copied works by old masters to improve his painting technique. In England, Hess learned to paint {{in the style of}} John Constable, selling his paintings through a New York City art dealer. While in England, he also became interested in sculpture. The work of Henry Moore was especially influential on his development as an artist. Moore's abstract works captured human figures as well as aspects of landscape and nature. Following Moore's artistic vision, Hess began producing abstract style sculptures.|$|E

25|$|The {{district}} got {{its present}} {{name in the}} early eighteenth century and its present shape in the later half of the eighteenth century. Murshidabad town, which lends {{its name to the}} district, derived its name from its founder, Murshid Quli Khan. Travellers marvelled at its glory through the ages. The city, lying just east of the Bhagirathi River, is an agricultural trade and silk-weaving centre. Originally called Makhsudabad, it was reputedly founded by the Mughal emperor Akbar in the 16th century. Kartalab Khan was appointed as Diwan of Bengal Subah in 1701 CE by Aurangzeb. <b>He</b> <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> office from Dacca (present day Dhaka) to Maksudabad in 1702 CE. In 1703 CE, Aurangzeb honoured him with the title of Murshid Quli Khan and granted the permission to rename the town as Murshidabad in 1704 CE after his newly acquired title.|$|E
25|$|Although Alexander I {{was brought}} to the throne in 1400 by the Hungarians (with {{assistance}} from Mircea I of Wallachia), <b>he</b> <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> allegiances towards Poland (notably engaging Moldavian forces on the Polish side in the Battle of Grunwald and the Siege of Marienburg), and placed his own choice of rulers in Wallachia. His reign {{was one of the most}} successful in Moldavia's history, but also saw the very first confrontation with the Ottoman Turks at Cetatea Albă in 1420, and later even a conflict with the Poles. A deep crisis was to follow Alexandru's long reign, with his successors battling each other in a succession of wars that divided the country until the murder of Bogdan II and the ascension of Peter III Aaron in 1451. Nevertheless, Moldavia was subject to further Hungarian interventions after that moment, as Matthias Corvinus deposed Aron and backed Alexăndrel to the throne in Suceava. Petru Aron's rule also signified the beginning of Moldavia's Ottoman Empire allegiance, as the ruler agreed to pay tribute to Sultan Mehmed II.|$|E
25|$|In 1986, {{at the age}} of 28, he {{discovered}} he was HIV positive, Lestrade developed a career as a freelance music journalist, writing for Gai Pied, Libération and Rolling Stone. He played an influential role in the new house/techno music scene, writing weekly reviews in Libération that were widely read. In 1989, at 31, <b>he</b> <b>shifted</b> <b>his</b> focus to AIDS activism, and founded the first French chapter of ACT UP with close friends and journalists Pascal R. Loubet and Luc Coulavin.

TRT-5 was at the forefront of AIDS treatment issues, and Lestrade was one of its administrators until 2002. By 2000, Lestrade switched from treatment issues to AIDS prevention and became a leading voice against barebacking and confronted the ground-breaking writer Guillaume Dustan. The romanesque story of this fight was written (without Lestrade's approval) in Tristan Garcia's first book, awarded by the prix de Flore, La meilleure part des hommes in 2008.|$|E
