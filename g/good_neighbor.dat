5|$|A bitter union strike {{began in}} May 1941, which was {{resolved}} without the angered Walt Disney's involvement in July and August of that year. As Walt Disney Productions was {{being set up}} as a union shop, Walt Disney and several studio employees were sent by the US government on a <b>Good</b> <b>Neighbor</b> policy trip to Central and South America. The Disney strike and its aftermath led to an exodus of several animation professionals from the studio, from top-level animators such as Art Babbitt and Bill Tytla to artists better known for their work outside the Disney studio such as Frank Tashlin, Maurice Noble, Walt Kelly, Bill Meléndez, and John Hubley. Hubley, with several other Disney strikers, went on to found the United Productions of America studio, Disney's key animation rival in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Butler {{participated in}} a series of occupations, police actions, and {{interventions}} by the United States in Central America and the Caribbean, commonly called the Banana Wars because their goal was to protect American commercial interests in the region, particularly those of the United Fruit Company. This company had significant financial stakes in the production of bananas, tobacco, sugar cane, and other products throughout the Caribbean, Central America and the northern portions of South America. The U.S. was also trying to advance its own political interests by maintaining its influence in the region and especially its control of the Panama Canal. These interventions started with the Spanish–American War in 1898 and ended with the withdrawal of troops from Haiti and President Franklin D. Roosevelt's <b>Good</b> <b>Neighbor</b> Policy in 1934. After his retirement, Butler became an outspoken critic of the business interests in the Caribbean, criticizing the ways in which U.S. businesses and Wall Street bankers imposed their agenda on United States foreign policy during this period.|$|E
5|$|Production of {{full-length}} animated features {{was temporarily}} suspended {{after the release}} of Bambi. Given the financial failures of some of the recent features and World War II cutting off much of the overseas cinema market, the studio's financiers at the Bank of America would only loan the studio working capital if it temporarily restricted itself to shorts production. Then in-production features such as Peter Pan, Alice in Wonderland, and Lady and the Tramp were therefore put on hold until after the war. Other issues affecting the studio at the time included the drafting of several Disney animators to fight in World War II, and the necessity for the studio to focus on producing wartime content for the U.S. Army, particularly military training, and civilian propaganda films. From 1942 to 1943, 95 percent of the studio's animation output was for the military. During the war, Disney produced the live-action/animated military propaganda feature Victory Through Air Power (1943), and a series of Latin culture-themed shorts resulting from the 1941 <b>Good</b> <b>Neighbor</b> trip were compiled into two features, Saludos Amigos (1942) and The Three Caballeros (1944).|$|E

25|$|The <b>Good</b> <b>Neighbor</b> {{policy had}} {{been linked to}} U.S. {{interference}} in Latin America; Roosevelt sought better diplomatic relations with Brazil and other South American nations, and pledged to refrain from military intervention (which had occurred to protect U.S. business interests in industries such as mining or agriculture). Hollywood was asked to help, and Walt Disney Studios and 20th Century Fox participated. Miranda was considered a goodwill ambassador and a promoter of intercontinental culture.|$|E
25|$|Miranda was {{encouraged}} by the U.S. government as part of Roosevelt's <b>Good</b> <b>Neighbor</b> policy, designed to strengthen ties with Latin America. It was believed that performers like her would give the policy a favorable impression with the American public. Miranda's contract with 20th Century Fox lasted from 1941 to 1946, shortly after the creation (in 1940) of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs. The goal of the OCIAA, based in Rio de Janeiro, was to obtain support from Latin American society and its governments for the United States.|$|E

Roosevelt and Hull pursued the <b>Good</b> <b>Neighbor</b> policy, which sought to avoid U.S. intervention in Latin American affairs. In the aftermath of Mexican agrarian reforms, he developed the Hull Doctrine {{as a way to}} compensate foreign investors in the aftermath of nationalization. In November 1941, he presented the Hull note to Japan, demanding Japanese withdrawal from French Indochina and China. In 1943, Hull and his staff drafted the document that became the United Nations Charter. Hull resigned as Secretary of State due to poor health in 1944.|$|E

50|$|<b>Good</b> <b>Neighbors</b> is a {{humanitarian}} and development organization from Seoul, Korea that originated as a non-profit, non-governmental organization in 1991. Funded projects concentrated mainly on equity of life, primarily by supporting orphanages, handicapped children programs, living arrangements for disadvantaged widows, rural community {{development and the}} assistance of disadvantaged families of tuberculosis patients in Korea. The organization has since been reorganized in 1996 and now supports projects in 35 countries. The majority of those programs focus on ultimately enabling the young and poor to become self-reliant through education and nutrition. In August 1996, <b>Good</b> <b>Neighbors</b> was granted General Consultative Status, the highest status level for an NGO, with the UN ECOSOC. In 2007, <b>Good</b> <b>Neighbors</b> was recognized by the UN with a Millennium Development Goal (MDG) Award for their achievements in Universal Primary Education.|$|R

25|$|The main {{foreign policy}} {{initiative}} of Roosevelt's first term was the <b>Good</b> <b>Neighbor</b> Policy, {{which was a}} re-evaluation of U.S. policy towards Latin America. The United States had frequently intervened in Latin America following the promulgation of the Monroe Doctrine in 1823, and the United States had occupied several Latin American nations in the Banana Wars that had occurred following the Spanish–American War of 1898. After Roosevelt took office, he withdrew U.S. forces from Haiti and reached new treaties with Cuba and Panama, ended their status as U.S. protectorates. In December 1933, Roosevelt signed the Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of States, renouncing the right to intervene unilaterally {{in the affairs of}} Latin American countries. He also normalized relations with the Soviet Union, ending the policy of nonrecognition that had prevailed in the United States since the Russian Revolution.|$|E
25|$|The Brazilian film {{industry}} {{began in the}} late 19th century, during {{the early days of the}} Belle Époque. While there were national film productions during the early 20th century, American films such as Rio the Magnificent were made in Rio de Janeiro to promote tourism in the city. The films Limite (1931) and Ganga Bruta (1933), the latter being produced by Adhemar Gonzaga through the prolific studio Cinédia, were poorly received at release and failed at the box office, but are acclaimed nowadays and placed among the finest Brazilian films of all time. The 1941 unfinished film It's All True was divided in four segments, two of which were filmed in Brazil and directed by Orson Welles; it was originally produced as part of the United States' <b>Good</b> <b>Neighbor</b> Policy during Getúlio Vargas' Estado Novo government.|$|E
