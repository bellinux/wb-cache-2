40|$|ABSTRACT We {{previously}} reported {{that up to}} 50 % of messenger RNAs (mRNA) are oxidatively damaged in the affected area of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brains. The role of RNA oxidation in the cell death process is unknown. In the present study, we used cortical primary dissociated cultures to investigate the relationship between RNA oxidation and neuron degeneration induced by various insults, including hydrogen peroxide, glutamate, and amyloid � peptide. These insults mediate the production of reactive oxygen species and thus induce oxidative stress. The results showed that RNA oxidation was an early event far preceding cell death, not merely a consequence of dying cells. RNA oxidation occurred primarily in a distinct group of neurons that <b>died</b> later. <b>Identification</b> of oxidized RNA specie...|$|R

50|$|Asperger <b>died</b> {{before his}} <b>identification</b> of {{this pattern of}} {{behaviour}} became widely recognised. This was {{in part due to}} his work being exclusively in German and as such it was little-translated; medical academics, then as now, also disregarded Asperger’s work based on its merits or lack thereof. English researcher Lorna Wing proposed the condition Asperger’s syndrome in a 1981 paper, Asperger’s syndrome: a clinical account, that challenged the previously accepted model of autism presented by Leo Kanner in 1943. It was not until 1991 that an authoritative translation of Asperger’s work was made by Uta Frith; before this AS had still been “virtually unknown”. Frith said that fundamental questions regarding the diagnosis had not been answered, and the necessary scientific data to address this did not exist. Unlike Kanner, who overshadowed Asperger, the latter’s findings were ignored and disregarded in the English-speaking world in his lifetime.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Notochordal cell-conditioned medium (NCCM) has {{previously}} {{shown to have}} a stimulatory effect on nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) in alginate and pellet cultures. These culture methods provide a different environment than the nucleus pulposus (NP) tissue, in which the NCCM ultimately should exert its effect. The objective {{of this study is}} to test whether NCCM stimulates NPCs within their native environment, and whether combined stimulation with NCCM and addition of BMSCs has a synergistic effect on extracellular matrix production. Methods: Bovine NP tissue was cultured in an artificial annulus in base medium (BM), porcine NCCM, or BM supplemented with 1 [*]μg/mL Link N. Furthermore, BM and NCCM samples were injected with 106 BMSCs per NP sample. Samples were cultured for 4 weeks, and analyzed for biochemical contents (water, glycosaminoglycan [GAG], hydroxyproline, and DNA), gene expression (COL 1 A 1, COL 2 A 1, ACAN, and SOX 9), and histology by Safranin O/Fast Green staining. Results: Culture in NCCM resulted in increased proteoglycan content compared to day 0 and BM, similar to Link N. However, only minor differences in gene expression compared to day 0 were observed. Addition of BMSCs did not result in increased GAG content, and surprisingly, DNA content in BMSC-injected groups was not higher than in the other groups after 4 weeks of culture. Discussion: This study shows that, indeed, NCCM is capable of stimulating NPC matrix production within the NP environment. The lack of increased DNA content in the BMSC-injected groups indicates that BMSCs have <b>died</b> over time. <b>Identification</b> of the bioactive factors in NCCM is crucial for further development of an NCCM-based treatment for intervertebral disc regeneration...|$|R
40|$|The Neuberger review made {{a number}} of {{recommendations}} to improve end of life care, including research into the biology of dying. An important aspect of the biology of <b>dying</b> is the <b>identification</b> of biomarkers as indices of disease processes. Biomarkers have the potential to inform the current, limited understanding of the dying process and assist clinicians in recognising dying, in particular how to distinguish dying from reversible acute deterioration. To critically appraise the literature on biological factors that may be used as prognostic indicators in advanced cancer patients and to identify candidate biomarkers of the dying process that can be measured serially in cancer patients' bodily fluids. A systematically structured review was conducted using three electronic databases. A hand search of six peer-reviewed journals and conference abstracts was also conducted. Studies reporting prognostic biomarkers in cancer patients with a median survival of ≤ 90 days and post-mortem studies were included. Final levels of evidence and recommendations were made using the Evidence Based Medicine modified GRADE system. 30 articles were included. Seven prognostic biological factors demonstrated Grade A evidence (lymphocyte count, white blood cell count, serum C-reactive protein, albumin, sodium, urea and alkaline phosphatase). An additional eleven prognostic factors were identified with Grade B evidence (platelet count, international normalised ratio, serum vitamin B 12, prealbumin, bilirubin, cholesterol, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, lactate dehydrogenase, pseudocholinesterase and urate). A number of biomarkers were specifically identified {{in the last two weeks}} of life but limitations exist. No post-mortem studies met the inclusion criteria. The biology of dying is an important area for future research, with the evidence focused on signs, symptoms and prognostic factors.

40|$|Objectives. We {{sought to}} assess the {{prognostic}} value of heart rate variability measures, including Poincaré plots, in patients with mild to moderate chronic heart failure. Background. Mortality is high in patients with heart failure, {{and many of them}} <b>die</b> suddenly. However, <b>identification</b> of high risk patients, particularly those with an increased risk for sudden death, has remained difficult. Methods. We studied 95 patients with heart failure (mean [±SD] age 60 ± 8 years, left ventricular ejection fraction 0. 29 ± 0. 09, New York Heart Association functional class II [81 %] and III [19 %]) during up to 4 years of follow-up. Heart rate variability measures and Poincaré plots were obtained from 24 -h Holter recordings. Results. During follow-up, 17 (18 %) of the 95 patients died. In 15 patients, death was cardiac related (11 patients experienced sudden death). None of the conventional time and frequency domain measures of heart rate variability were related to survival. In contrast, abnormal Poincaré plots identified a significantly higher risk for all-cause cardiac death (Cox proportional hazards ratio 5. 7, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 6 to 20. 6, univariate analysis) and for sudden cardiac death (hazards ratio 6. 8, 95 % CI 1. 5 to 31. 4) compared with those with normal Poincaré plots. Patients with abnormal Poincaré plots were shown to have a lower left ventricular ejection fraction (0. 26 ± 0. 10 vs. 0. 31 ± 0. 08, p < 0. 05) and higher plasma norepinephrine concentrations (506 ± 207 pg/ml vs. 411 ± 175 pg/ml, p < 0. 05). In multivariate analysis, abnormal Poincaré plots still had independent prognostic value, both for all-cause cardiac mortality and for sudden cardiac death (hazards ratio 5. 3, 95 % CI 1. 2 to 17. 1, hazards ratio 4. 5, 95 % CI 1. 0 to 27. 5, respectively. Conclusions. Heart rate variability analysis, as assessed by Poincaré plots, has independent prognostic value in patients with mild to moderate chronic heart failure and identifies an increased risk for all-cause and sudden cardiac death in these patients...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Complications in {{the central}} nervous system (CNS) from acute otitis media (AOM) and chronic otitis media (COM) are {{becoming}} fewer, although they still represent a challenge for early recognition, adequate treatment, and satisfactory results. This retrospective study analyzed clinical data and therapeutic options in 33 patients with intracranial involvement resulting from otitis media. Important clinical features of intracranial complications and the sequence of the most efficient therapeutic maneuvers are discussed. METHODS: Charts of six patients with AOM and 27 patients with COM associated with CNS complications were analyzed for clinical presentation, imaging, and therapeutic approach. RESULTS: Ages ranged from 6 months to 79 years, with no gender predilection. Persistent fever, headache, and purulent otorrhea were the main symptoms. Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most common microorganisms in COM, and Pneumococus and Haemophilus were the most common microorganisms in AOM. Nineteen patients (58 %) presented with more than 1 CNS complication, resulting in a total of 56 complications, including 26 cases of otogenic brain abscess, 21 cases of meningitis, 5 cases of lateral sinus thromboses, two cases of subdural empyemas, 1 case of epidural empyema, and 1 case of meningocele. Surgical interventions included craniotomy and drainage of the abscess (n = 17), open mastoidectomy with abscess drained through the mastoid (n = 10), open mastoidectomy alone (n = 8), and closed mastoidectomy (n = 2). Twelve patients who underwent craniotomy had subsequent mastoidectomy for recurrent abscess. At the 6 -month, 66 % of patients presented without sequelae, 24 % presented with sequelae, and 9 % <b>died.</b> CONCLUSION: Early <b>identification</b> and prompt clinical and surgical intervention with mandatory drainage of the middle ear (primary disease), was essential for better outcome.

40|$|Defective {{electrical}} connections in power distribution systems will result many circuit and equipment failures. Power distribution loss reduction and power system reliability improvement are becoming very important vicinities to be investigated. There are several methods available for power distribution loss reduction. Energy losses by connectors installed in power distribution network {{is one of}} the highly concerned. Quality of power line connections directly affects the power system reliability. Compression connectors or compression joints are a popular type of connectors used for joining or terminating conductors in power distribution network. Identification of good workman practices for power distribution line connections is important to make the power system more reliable. Standardization of process of power line connector installation and proper die selection technique for compression connectors is essential for power system reliability improvements. This study is an attempt to identify good workman practices required for making perfect power distribution line connections. This will be a guide in the assembly and preventive maintenance of efficient {{electrical connections}} for power distribution circuits. An efficient connection shows minimum resistance, both at initial assembly and in the long run. Data and experience gained through usage on power line connectors by Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) is the basis of this study. The results of tests carried out on power distribution line connections are incorporated in the recommendations. Properties of conductor metals and metal oxides are discussed. These illustrate requirements of recommended methods of making connections. Requirement for the proper selection of connectors, the proper preparation of conductors, and the proper application of fusion, compression, and bolted connectors are identified. Standards available on power line connectors are discussed to illustrate effective workman practices. Photographs of bad workman practices are included with explanations. Mathematical formula is developed for calculating correct die size for compression connectors. Amount of material available in connector and conductor are compared with area inside the suggested die for determining the correct <b>die</b> size. Performance <b>identification</b> of any type of connector installed in a power line is carried out by thermal imaging. Thermal images taken from few installed connectors are included and a procedure for assessing connector performance is suggested...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroduction/ObjectivesSurgical site {{infection}} (SSI) in {{vascular surgery}} is a complication {{that may lead}} not only to healing problems, but also limb loss and risk of death. The incidence of surgical site infection at the groin after vascular procedures ranges among 3 % to 44 %. The {{aim of this study}} is to review the incidence of groin infection in our department and the degree of correlation between infection, known risk factors and preventing measures. MethodsRetrospective review of consecutive arterial vascular surgeries in a university central hospital during one year. Patients undergoing groin incisions were studied according to baseline demographics, clinical characteristics, active infection, previous inguinal access, antithrombotic therapy, indication for intervention, prophylactic antibiotic use, type of intervention and type of graft used. Wound site infections over a 30 -day period were registered and graded based on Szilagyi classification. On patients with documented groin infection, the presentation timing, modality of treatment (surgical and non-surgical) and time of healing were recorded. Data were analyzed by using SPSS 18. 0 version software. ResultsFrom January to December 2013, 1266 vascular surgeries were performed. Of these, 782 were arterial vascular procedures, 279 by inguinal approach, with a total of 358 groin incisions. Our base population included 241 patients (31 patients with more than one procedure in a year). Total infection rate was 4. 7 % (17 / 358 groin incisions). All Szilagyi I (n= 4) resolved with antibiotic only; three of the ten Szilagyi II infections needed drainage/debridement at operation room; the other Szilagyi II resolved with antibiotic and wound care. All Szilagyi III infections (n= 3) were treated with bypass removal, and in two patients an in situ revascularization was performed. These two patients <b>died</b> from sepsis. <b>Identification</b> of the infecting agent was possible in 9 patients, with the most common isolated agent being Pseudomonas. Hypertension was significantly associated with a higher risk of SSI (p= 0. 033). Discussion/ConclusionsIn our department, the infection rate of the inguinal approach equals the best international standards described. These results may be the outcome of a carefully planned strategy of infection control. Arising from the fact that groin SSI is a low incidence event, correlations between suspected risk factors and this infection are hard to establish. Longer follow-ups would be useful for identification of all groin infections...|$|R
40|$|Software {{systems are}} playing an {{increasingly}} important role in {{almost every aspect of}} today’s society such that they impact on our businesses, industry, leisure, health and safety. Many of these systems are extremely large and complex and depend upon the correct interaction of many hundreds or even thousands of heterogeneous components. Commensurate with this increased reliance on software is the need for high quality products that meet customer expectations, perform reliably and which can be cost-effectively and safely maintained. Techniques such as software configuration management have proved to be invaluable during the development process to ensure that this is the case. However, there are {{a very large number of}} legacy systems which were not developed under controlled conditions, but which still, need to be maintained due to the heavy investment incorporated within them. Such systems are characterised by extremely high program comprehension overheads and the probability that new errors will be introduced during the maintenance process often with serious consequences. To address the issues concerning maintenance of legacy systems this thesis has defined and developed a new process and associated maintenance model, Inverse Software Configuration Management (ISCM). This model centres on a layered approach to the program comprehension process through the definition of a number of software configuration abstractions. This information together with the set of rules for reclaiming the information is stored within an Extensible System Information Base (ESIB) via, die definition of a Programming-in-the- Environment (PITE) language, the Inverse Configuration Description Language (ICDL). In order to assist the application of the ISCM process across a wide range of software applications and system architectures, <b>die</b> PISCES (Proforma <b>Identification</b> Scheme for Configurations of Existing Systems) method has been developed as a series of defined procedures and guidelines. To underpin the method and to offer a user-friendly interface to the process a series of templates, the Proforma Increasing Complexity Series (PICS) has been developed. To enable the useful employment of these techniques on large-scale systems, the subject of automation has been addressed through the development of a flexible meta-CASE environment, the PISCES M 4 (MultiMedia Maintenance Manager) system. Of particular interest within this environment is the provision of a multimedia user interface (MUI) to die maintenance process. As a means of evaluating the PISCES method and to provide feedback into die ISCM process a number of practical applications have been modelled. In summary, this research has considered a number of concepts some of which are innovative in themselves, others of which are used in an innovative manner. In combination these concepts may be considered to considerably advance the knowledge and understanding of die comprehension process during the maintenance of legacy software systems. A number of publications have already resulted from the research and several more are in preparation. Additionally a number of areas for further study have been identified some of which are already underway as funded research and development projects...|$|R
