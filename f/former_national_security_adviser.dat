2500|$|Zbigniew Brzezinski, <b>former</b> <b>National</b> <b>Security</b> <b>Adviser</b> to President Carter, {{agrees with}} the main thesis of the book: President Carter, in my judgement, is correct in fearing {{that the absence of}} a fair and {{mutually}} acceptable resolution of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict is likely to produce a situation which de facto will resemble apartheid: i.e., two communities living side by side but repressively separated, with one enjoying prosperity and seizing the lands of the other, and the other living in poverty and deprivation. That is an outcome which must be avoided and I interpret his book as a strong plea for accommodation, which needs to be actively promoted by morally responsible engagement especially by America. Brzezinski also condemns the [...] "abusive reactions directed at Carter, including some newspaper ads" [...] for being [...] "objectionable and designed to intimidate an open public discussion." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Joe Klein of Time magazine in October 2008, Barack Obama expressed his intention {{to try to work}} with India and Pakistan to resolve the crisis. He said he had talked to Bill Clinton about it, as Clinton has experience as a mediator. In an editorial in The Washington Times, Selig S Harrison, director of the Asia Programme at the Center for International Policy and a senior scholar of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars called it Obama's first foreign policy mistake. In an editorial, The Australian called Obama's idea to appoint a presidential negotiator [...] "a very stupid and dangerous move indeed". In an editorial in Forbes, Reihan Salam, associate editor for The Atlantic, noted [...] "The smartest thing President Obama could do on Kashmir is probably nothing. We have to hope that India and Pakistan can work out their differences on Kashmir on their own". The Boston Globe called the idea of appointing Bill Clinton as an envoy to Kashmir [...] "a mistake". President Obama subsequently appointed Richard Holbrooke as special envoy to Pakistan and Afghanistan. President Asif Ali Zardari hoped that Holbrooke would help mediate to resolve the Kashmir issue. Kashmir was later removed from Holbrooke's mandate. [...] "Eliminating ... Kashmir from his job description ... is seen as a significant diplomatic concession to India that reflects increasingly warm ties between the country and the United States," [...] The Washington Post noted in a report.
