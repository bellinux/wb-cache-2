40|$|The {{continuation}} and exacerbation of {{many environmental}} failures illustrate that <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> justice’s influence on decision-making {{is not being}} systematically effective, giving rise to a renewed emphasis on finding new, more focused, justice models. This includes the energy justice concept, which has received ready and growing success. Yet for energy justice, a key question keeps arising: what does it add that <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> justice cannot? To answer this question this perspective outlines the origins, successes and failures of the <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> justice concepts, {{with a view to}} both distinguishing the energy justice field, and providing cautionary tales for it. It then outlines three points of departure, which it argues increases the opportunity of success for the energy justice concept: (1) “bounding out”, (2) non-anti-establishment pasts and (3) methodological strength.

40|$|The study investigates South Africa’s actions <b>and</b> efforts within <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> {{issues in}} {{relation}} to the country’s hosting of the 2010 FIFA Soccer World Cup. The investigation is conducted by applying idea analysis on the empirical material in order to highlight what ideas South Africa might have when it comes to <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> related measures in connection to the World Cup. The two theories of Behavioralism and Rational Choice are to be compared in order to reveal the true reasons for South Africa’s environmental actions. In addition, an own-formulated hypothesis which claims that measures within environmental issues are improved due to the 2010 World Cup is tested against the empirical material. Results are presented as a review over what is being done today within <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> issues in South Africa and these answers are then connected to the World Cup as it is analyzed concerning how the event affects the country’s policies and efforts within these areas. Finally, a concluding discussion states what role <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> issues have in connection to a major sporting event such as the 2010 FIFA World Cup and how South Africa administers this opportunity to act accordingly and present itself {{to the rest of the}} world...|$|R

Components for evaluating sustainability include the particular vehicles used for road, water or air transport; the source of energy; and the infrastructure used to accommodate the transport (roads, railways, airways, waterways, canals and terminals). Another component for evaluation is pipelines for transporting liquid or gas materials. Transport operations and logistics as well as transit-oriented development are also involved in evaluation. Transportation sustainability is largely being measured by transportation system effectiveness and efficiency {{as well as the}} <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> impacts of the system.|$|R

40|$|Tourism is an {{increasing}} {{part of the social}} planning and should strive more towards sustainable development (Müller 2007). The municipality of Karlstad strives to become "The eco- friendly city" (Karlstad 2016 a), which means that people are given the opportunity to live a good life in a sustainable way (WWF 2017). The study shows that cities today should strive to prioritize <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> issues in relation to destination development. This study examines how units in the municipality of Karlstad prioritize <b>and</b> include <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> issues in the work of making Karlstad attractive. How these areas affect each other, as well as how dialogues and collaborations appear in the municipality regarding environment <b>and</b> <b>climate.</b> The Regional Centre of Värmland, Karlstad, is a municipality that wishes to invest and create good business conditions in order to attract visitors (Karlstad 2016 b). At the same time, Karlstad is one of the cities in Sweden that is {{at the forefront of the}} work on climate change (SIDA 2014). This study uses a qualitative approach, semi-structured expert interviews and qualitative document analysis of Karlstad's <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> strategy <b>and</b> Visit Karlstad Tourism Strategic Destination Development Plan, deriving from a hermeneutical approach of understanding and interpreting the phenomenon environment <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> issues in relation to destination development. The study intends to answer questions about how <b>and</b> which <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> issues that are prioritized in the municipality of Karlstad in relation to destination development, if there are any conflicts of objectives and the ways in which the various development units cooperate in these areas. The theoretical framework of the study processes areas that deal with the municipality of Karlstad, destination development, sustainable development, environment, <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> changes <b>and</b> conflict of interests which are the themes of the study. Based on the results of the study, one can conclude that in social planning, both tourism, <b>and</b> <b>environmental</b> issues have taken more space, which has led to the use of the concept development more widely. The <b>environmental</b> <b>and</b> <b>climate</b> issue that the municipality of Karlstad choose to prioritize is the transport area. The municipality is actively working to reduce motorism and focus on sustainable alternative solutions in the area to make the city more attractive. These initiatives lead to certain conflicts of interest within the development units, so it is important that there are collaborations and dialogues between them. In addition, the development units of the municipality of Karlstad use strategies such as work tools to help them achieve the goals pursued. Uppsatsens betyg: Väl Godkänd</p...|$|R
