5|$|On {{the day of}} Germanicus' death {{his sister}} Livilla gave birth to twins by Drusus. The oldest was named Germanicus and died young. In 37, Germanicus' only {{remaining}} son Caligula became emperor and renamed September Germanicus {{in honor of his}} father. Many Romans, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> Tacitus, considered Germanicus to be their equivalent to King Alexander the Great, and believed that he would have easily surpassed the achievements of Alexander had he become emperor. In book eight of his Natural History, Pliny connects Germanicus, Augustus, and Alexander as fellow equestrians: when Alexander's horse Bucephalus died he named a city Bucephalia in his honor. Less monumental, Augustus' horse received a funeral mound, which Germanicus wrote a poem about.|$|E

5|$|Once in Ravenna, Helmichis and Rosamund rapidly became estranged. According to Paul, Longinus persuaded Rosamund {{to get rid}} of {{her husband}} so that he could marry her. To {{accomplish}} this, she made him drink a cup full of poison; before dying, however, Helmichis understood what his wife had done and forced her to drink the cup too, so they both died. According to Wolfram, there may be some historical truth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> Longinus' proposal to Rosamund, as it was possible to achieve Lombard kingship by marrying the queen, but the story of the two lovers' end is not historical but legendary. The mutual murder as told by Agnellus is given a different interpretation by Joaquin Martinez Pizarro: he sees Helmichis' last action as a symbol of how the natural hierarchy of sexes is at last restored, after the queen's actions had unnaturally modified the proper equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|Spanish Hill is a hill {{located in}} the borough of South Waverly, Pennsylvania. The hill is {{controversial}} among historians and archaeologists; opinions regarding the origin of structures found on the site vary from embankments created by early farmers, to {{the remnants of a}} Native American village and battlements, due to the site's similarity to the description found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> Étienne Brûlé of a settlement called Carantouan. The area in the hill's vicinity was previously occupied by Susquehannock Native Americans. It was a common site for both amateur and professional archaeology, as well as relic hunting. The source of the name remains unknown, but various theories have been proposed as to its origin.|$|E
5|$|The {{repulsion}} of the Arab {{assault on}} Nicaea {{was an important}} success for the Byzantines. Emperor Leo III the Isaurian (r. 717–741) regarded the city's survival {{as a sign of}} divine favour towards his newly instituted iconoclastic policies, and was encouraged to drive them further. This is probably related to an incident mentioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> Theophanes, where a certain Constantine, who served as a groom (strator) to Artabasdos, threw a stone on an icon of the Virgin Mary and then trampled on it. The soldier was killed the next day by a catapult, a fact which Theophanes reports as evidence of divine vengeance. However, this passage shows strong signs of tampering by the fervently anti-iconoclast Theophanes, from what was probably originally a pro-iconoclast story.|$|E

25|$|Dacians had {{developed}} the murus dacicus (double-skinned ashlar-masonry with rubble fill and tie beams) characteristic to their complexes of fortified cities, like their capital Sarmisegetuza Regia {{in what is}} today Hunedoara County, Romania.

The degree of their urban development was displayed on Trajan's Column and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> how Sarmizegetusa Regia was defeated by the Romans.

Not until the middle of the 19th century was a complete translation of the Arabic text published. This was a translation into French by Pierre Amédée Jaubert. More recently sections of the text have been translated for particular regions. Beginning in the 1970 a critical edition of the complete Arabic text was published.|$|E
25|$|In 1648 Wilkins became Warden of Wadham College, in Oxford {{and under}} him the college prospered.

From those interested in experimental science, he drew together a significant group known as the Oxford Philosophical Club, which by 1650 had been constituted {{with a set of}} rules. Besides some of the London group (Goddard, Wallis, Ward, Wren who was a young protégé of Scarburgh), it included (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>account</b> <b>of</b> Thomas Sprat) Ralph Bathurst, Robert Boyle, William Petty, Lawrence Rooke, Thomas Willis, and Matthew Wren. Robert Hooke was gradually recruited into the Wilkins group: he arrived at Christ Church, Oxford in 1653, working his way to an education, became assistant to Willis, and became known to Wilkins (possibly via Richard Busby) as a technician. By 1658 he was working with Boyle.|$|E
