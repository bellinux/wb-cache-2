25|$|By {{the first}} half of the 18th century, the Authorized Version was {{effectively}} unchallenged as the sole English translation in current use in Protestant churches, and was so dominant that the Roman Catholic Church in England issued in 1750 a revision of the 1610 Douay-Rheims Bible by Richard Challoner that was very much closer to the Authorized Version than to the original. However, <b>general</b> <b>standards</b> of spelling, punctuation, typesetting, capitalization and grammar had changed radically in the 100 years since the first edition of the Authorized Version, and all printers in the market were introducing continual piecemeal changes to their Bible texts to bring them into line with current practice – and with public expectations of standardized spelling and grammatical construction.|$|E
25|$|Gardiner's largest {{role in the}} Conservative Party {{would be}} in {{reforming}} the party's policies to be more progressive. Gardiner {{was instrumental in the}} 1942 Port Hope policy conference, chairing the discussions of the labour committee. Gardiner came out in favour of legal safeguards for collective bargaining and uniform and <b>general</b> <b>standards</b> in wages and working conditions, including support for a 'closed shop' in collective agreements. The Port Hope policies were adopted at the Winnipeg national leadership convention in Winnipeg in December 1942, giving the party a systematically drafted platform. Gardiner again chaired the labour committee and acted in favour of reformed social security, as lieutenant of the resolution and policy committee. At the convention, the party would choose John Bracken as leader, and change its name to the Progressive Conservative Party.|$|E

25|$|In {{the later}} {{years of the}} New State's rule, the city had a {{population}} boom, driven by economic development and industrial progress. During the 1950s and especially the 1960s, there was a large-scale rural exodus from the provinces to the capital. Surrounding areas were filled with peasants uprooted from farms and dwelling in squalid neighbourhoods. The largest and best known of these was the Brandoa. From the 1960s onward, government policy {{was influenced by the}} technocratic faction in the regime which advocated modernisation projects including expansion of the educational system and industrialisation, leading to a fast-growing national economy with increases in <b>general</b> <b>standards</b> of living and quality of life in the city. Although it is generally agreed that the republic accomplished several notable social and economic achievements, including major improvements in public health and education levels in the period between the end of the Second World War and the 1974 revolution, the New State was finally deposed by the Carnation Revolution (Revolução dos Cravos), launched in Lisbon with a military coup on 25 April 1974. The movement was joined by a popular campaign of civil resistance, leading to the fall of the Estado Novo, the restoration of democracy, and the withdrawal of Portugal from its African colonies and East Timor. The strain of waging the Portuguese Colonial War had overextended and weakened the Portuguese dictatorship, leading to the overthrow of Caetano's regime. Younger military officers, disillusioned by a far-off and taxing war, began to side with the pro-independence resistance against Portugal and eventually led the military coup in Lisbon, ending a dictatorship that had been in power since 1933.|$|E
500|$|In September 1922, Filkins again {{excavated}} at the site, {{this time}} with the aid of Gravesend resident Charles Gilbert. Their project was financed through grants provided by the British Association and the Society of Antiquaries, with Filkins noting {{that at the time of}} its commencement, [...] "a miniature jungle" [...] had grown up around the site which had to be cleared. Excavation continued sporadically until at least 1926. Human remains were discovered, and placed into the possession of Sir Arthur Keith of the Royal College of Surgeons, although it is also recorded that at some point between 1939 and 1945 human remains that had been found at the site were reburied in the churchyard at Trottiscliffe. This excavation revealed all the existing sarsens surrounding the monument, several which had previously been buried. The stones of the chamber were shored up with concrete foundations where Filkins deemed it necessary. Although Filkins' excavation was comprehensive, it did ignore stone holes, packing stones, and their relationship to the mound. In 1998, Ashbee noted that while from [...] "a present-day perspective, it is possible to see shortcomings in terms of the <b>general</b> <b>standards</b> of the early part of this century, there is much to commend." ...|$|E

2500|$|Justice Powell {{believed}} {{that there was a}} liberty interest in being released on parole that stemmed from the Due Process Clause, independent of the statutory language used to create an individual state's parole system. [...] Powell rejected the distinction the majority made between a hoped-for release and a previously granted release. [...] "When a State adopts a parole standard that applies <b>general</b> <b>standards</b> of eligibility, prisoners justifiably expect that parole will be granted fairly and according to law whenever those standards are met." [...] This expectation, in turn, was the source of the liberty interest Powell believed was protected by the Due Process Clause.|$|E
