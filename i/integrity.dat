30|$|Figure  3 {{shows the}} effect of {{increasing}} the LCM concentration on the seal <b>integrities</b> at the different fracture width for both single LCM and mixtures. By increasing the concentration of nutshells from 15 to 50  ppb the seal <b>integrities</b> improved approximately 500  % (Fig.  3 a). For graphite and nutshells blend (Fig.  3 b), the seal <b>integrities</b> were improved when tested using TS 1 and TS 2 by 22 and 113  %, respectively.|$|R

5|$|Laws {{dealing with}} digital {{evidence}} {{are concerned with}} two issues: <b>integrity</b> and authenticity. <b>Integrity</b> is ensuring {{that the act of}} seizing and acquiring digital media does not modify the evidence (either the original or the copy). Authenticity refers to the ability to confirm the <b>integrity</b> of information; for example that the imaged media matches the original evidence. The ease with which digital media can be modified means that documenting the chain of custody from the crime scene, through analysis and, ultimately, to the court, (a form of audit trail) is important to establish the authenticity of evidence.|$|E
5|$|The {{passengers}} and crew of both vessels consulted on whether to continue southwards or turn back and await better weather. According to one source, missionary W.P. Crook aboard <b>Integrity,</b> there was unanimity for continuing the voyage except for Captain Houstoun, who wished to turn back. As Houstoun was the nominal commander of the voyage his view prevailed and <b>Integrity</b> and Contest returned to Port Jackson together, arriving on 13 July.|$|E

30|$|From the plotted {{results of}} the three high {{concentrations}} (50  ppb) single LCM treatments shown in Fig.  2 a, nutshells resulted in higher seal <b>integrities</b> at the two fracture widths (up to 2200 psi) compared to graphite (449 psi) and sized calcium carbonate (589 psi). The same was observed for LCM mixtures shown in Fig.  2 b, where treatments containing nutshells and graphite (40  ppb) exhibited higher sealing <b>integrities</b> up to 2800 psi {{compared to the other}} blend containing graphite and sized calcium carbonate at higher concentration (80  ppb) for the two different fracture width (589 and 224 psi for TS 1 and TS 2, respectively). In general, as anticipated, increasing the fracture width resulted in weaker seal <b>integrities.</b>|$|R

5|$|After {{ten days}} she was {{returned}} to sea and reached Port Dalrymple {{on the morning of}} 5 November. Buffalo had already arrived, {{but there was no sign}} of Lady Nelson or Francis. Houstoun's achievement in navigating the storm was recognised through a transfer to Buffalo, a larger and more prestigious vessel than <b>Integrity.</b> His former colonial command was allocated to midshipman Charles Robbins, who was promoted Acting Lieutenant by virtue of his new role. The remaining vessels in the flotilla, Lady Nelson and Francis, arrived in Port Dalrymple on 21 November. <b>Integrity</b> departed a week later, Robbins having been ordered to explore the far western coastline of Van Diemen's Land.|$|E

40|$|Effects of mucuna seed extract (MSE) in tris-extenders on sperm {{functional}} <b>integrities</b> and seminal {{oxidative stress}} indices of vitrified sperm of West African Dwarf (WAD) goat bucks were investigated. Varying levels (0, 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75, 1 g/ 100 mL of diluent) of MSE in tris-extenders were diluted with semen specimens. Diluted semen specimens were vitrified and preserved in liquid nitrogen. The {{results showed that}} sperm functional <b>integrities</b> (acrosome and membrane <b>integrities)</b> in MSE extenders were comparable. However, seminal oxidative stress indices (malondialdehyde [MDA] and acrosin activity) differed (P< 0. 05) among the various treatments and the control. The results revealed that semen vitrified with MSE had reduced (P< 0. 05) MDA concentrations compared to the control. Higher (P< 0. 05) acrosin activities were recorded in semen vitrified with MSE compared to the control except at 0. 25 g MSE and optimal values were recorded at 1 g MSE. The findings indicated that MSE in the tris-extenders reduced MDA concentration with congruent elevated acrosin activity and consequently maintained sperm functional <b>integrities</b> of vitrified spermatozoa of the WAD goat...|$|R

5|$|In 1805 <b>Integrity</b> {{encountered}} and recaptured a Spanish brig {{which had}} been unlawfully seized by privateers and concealed in the Kent Group of islands in Bass Strait. Having returned the Spanish vessel to colonial control, <b>Integrity</b> was designated the task of sailing to Chile to negotiate its return to Spain.

30|$|To {{correlate}} the PSD with {{variation in}} the seal <b>integrities,</b> the seal <b>integrities</b> for each fracture width are plotted on the left y-axis versus the particle size distribution obtained from the dry sieve analysis on the right y-axis as shown in Figs.  4 and 5. It is clearly observed that the D 90 plays the most {{significant effect on the}} overall seal <b>integrities</b> where larger particle sizes resulted in enhancing the seal <b>integrities.</b> In other words, the D 90 value should be selected such that it matches the fracture width to ensure fracture sealing, which is in agreement with previous findings (Smith et al. 1996; Hands et al. 1998). The improved performance of treatments containing nutshells is attributed {{to the fact that the}} D 90 values of theses blends ranging between 1900 and 2400 microns are higher than the fracture widths (Figs.  4, 5). All LCM treatments having a D 90 that is smaller than the used fracture width failed to establish a seal within the fracture. Based on the results, it is recommended that the D 90 for any granular LCM treatment for a specific fracture width be equal or slightly larger than the expected fracture width.|$|R

These two hacked servers were part of the infrastructure used to build third-party software packages. The FreeBSD Security Team checked the <b>integrity</b> of the binary packages and {{announced that}} no unauthorized change was made to the binary packages, but they stated that they can't guarantee the <b>integrity</b> of packages that were downloaded between 19 September and 11 November.|$|E
