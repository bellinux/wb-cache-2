This {{was a turning point}} for public education in Lower Canada as the schools were created by legislation, the District Public Schools Act of 1807, which showed the government's willingness to support the costs of education and even the salary of a schoolmaster.

5|$|The {{distance}} to the Pleiades {{can be used as}} an <b>important</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> to calibrate the cosmic distance ladder. As the cluster is so close to the Earth, its distance is relatively easy to measure and has been estimated by many methods. Accurate knowledge of the distance allows astronomers to plot a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the cluster, which, when compared to those plotted for clusters whose distance is not known, allows their distances to be estimated. Other methods can then extend the distance scale from open clusters to galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and a cosmic distance ladder can be constructed. Ultimately astronomers' understanding of the age and future evolution of the universe is influenced by their knowledge of the {{distance to}} the Pleiades. Yet some authors argue that the controversy over the {{distance to the}} Pleiades discussed below is a red herring, since the cosmic distance ladder can (presently) rely on a suite of other nearby clusters where consensus exists regarding the distances as established by Hipparcos and independent means (e.g., the Hyades, Coma Berenices cluster, etc.).|$|E

2500|$|However, {{the process}} of {{separating}} “baseflow” from “direct runoff” is an inexact science. [...] In part this is because these two concepts are not, themselves, entirely distinct and unrelated. [...] Return flow from groundwater increases along with overland flow from saturated or impermeable areas during and after a storm event; [...] moreover, a particular water molecule can easily move through both pathways {{en route to the}} watershed outlet. [...] Therefore, separation of a purely “baseflow component” in a hydrograph is a somewhat arbitrary exercise.
