5|$|Through {{the course}} of the {{research}} represented in the book, Heilmann considers and eventually rejects the possibility of all living and several extinct groups of reptiles as potential ancestors for modern birds, including crocodilians, pterosaurs and several groups of dinosaurs. Despite his acknowledgment that some of the smaller Jurassic theropods had many similarities to Archaeopteryx and modern birds, he determined that they were unlikely to be direct bird ancestors and that they were instead closely–related offshoots, and concluded that the similarities were a result of convergent evolution rather than direct ancestry. Based essentially on a process of elimination, Heilmann arrives at the conclusion that birds must be descended from thecodonts, a group of archosaurs that lived during the Permian and Triassic periods. Although this conclusion was later shown to be inaccurate, The Origin of Birds was regarded as a masterful piece of scholarship at the time and set the international agenda for research in bird evolution <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> century, and much of its research remains of interest.|$|E

25|$|The popular club {{built a new}} stadium, the Glückauf-Kampfbahn, in 1928, and {{acknowledged}} the city's support by renaming themselves FC Gelsenkirchen-Schalke 04. They won their first West German championship in 1929, but the following year were sanctioned for exceeding salary levels set by the league and, in an era that considered professionalism in sport to be anathema, found themselves banned from play <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> year.|$|E

The rotor control, transmission and other systems were left essentially unchanged.|$|E
25|$|Clergymen {{all over}} the world became shocked when dresses to be worn with modest round or V-shaped necklines became fashionable around 1913. In the German Empire, for example, all Roman Catholic bishops joined in issuing a {{pastoral}} letter attacking the new fashions. Fashions became more restrained in terms of décolletage, while exposure of the leg became more accepted in Western societies, during World War I and remained so <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> century.|$|E
25|$|Despite those difficulties, Emperor Samuil {{resisted}} the Byzantine army, which reached its zenith under Basil II, <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> century. In 976 the Bulgarians {{led by the}} Cometopuli brothers reconquered the north-eastern parts of the realm. The first Byzantine attempts for counter-attack were repulsed after the annihilation of a 60,000 force {{in the battle of}} the Gates of Trajan in 986 in which Basil II himself barely escaped. In the following decade the Bulgarians took Thessaly, destroyed the Principality of Duklja, advanced deep to the south as far as Corinth on the Peloponnese peninsula and campaigned in Dalmatia and Bosnia.|$|E

25|$|<b>For</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> century, the Giro {{started and}} {{finished}} by Milan, {{the city where}} {{the headquarters of the}} Gazzetta dello Sport were located. The first time the race didn't start or finish in Milan was in 1911, where the start and finish were moved to Rome to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Italy's unification. With the occasional exception, the start and finish in Milan was the standard for the Giro d'Italia. However, since 1960 the place of departure has changed each year. Some years (1965, 1966, 1968, 1970, 1973, 1975, 1981–1989) the finish was also changed, but in 1990 the traditional finish in Milan was restored.|$|E
25|$|When ʿIsa died in 1284, he was {{succeeded by}} his son Muhanna. He and his brother Fadl ruled the emirate <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> century with two interruptions. The first was when Qalawun's successor, Sultan al-Ashraf Khalil, had them and their sons imprisoned in Cairo. Their cousin, Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr (grandson of Ali ibn Haditha) presided over the emirate until Muhanna was reinstalled in 1295, after al-Ashraf Khalil's death. Muhanna's {{allegiance}} vacillated between the Mamluks and the Ilkhanids between 1311 and 1330, after which he became firmly loyal to the Mamluk sultan, an-Nasir Muhammad. He died five years later {{and for the next}} seventy years, his sons and grandsons held the post with occasional interruptions during which Fadl's offspring or distant cousins were appointed.|$|E
25|$|Los Angeles {{employers}} {{had been}} successfully resisting unionization <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> century. Harrison Gray Otis, {{publisher of the}} Los Angeles Times, was vehemently anti-union. Otis first joined and then seized control of the local Merchants Association in 1896, renaming it the Merchants and Manufacturers' Association (colloquially known as the M), and using it and his newspaper's large circulation to spearhead a 20-year campaign to end the city's few remaining unions. Without unions to keep wages high, open shop employers in Los Angeles were able to undermine the wage standards set in heavily unionized San Francisco. Unions in San Francisco feared that employers in their city would also soon begin pressing for wage cuts and start an open shop drive of their own. The only solution they saw was to re-unionize Los Angeles.|$|E

25|$|Helped {{in part by}} a newly inked {{distribution}} {{agreement between}} Word and A that would give Petra and other Word-distributed bands placement in mainstream music stores for the first time, Beat the System sold more than 200,000 copies in four months, {{and by the end of}} the year, Billboard had certified Petra as the biggest-selling gospel music group in the country. When it debuted at No.18 on the Billboard Top 40 Inspirational LPs chart in February 1985, Beat the System trailed both Not of This World (No.6 in its 56th week on the chart) and More Power to Ya (No.15 in week 115). Not for long: It leapt to No.4 on the next chart, giving Petra two top 10 albums for the first time, and by June it had taken over the top spot on the chart, which it held for more than two months. In the end, Beat the System was one of the nation's top two Christian albums <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> year.|$|E
25|$|The lipid {{nature of}} the cell {{membrane}} was first correctly intuited by Quincke, who noted that a cell generally forms a spherical shape in water and, when broken in half, forms two smaller spheres. The only other known material to exhibit this behavior was oil. He also noted that a thin film of oil behaves as a semipermeable membrane, precisely as predicted. Based on these observations, Quincke asserted that the cell membrane comprised a fluid layer of fat less than 100nm thick. This theory was further extended by evidence {{from the study of}} anesthetics. Hans Meyer and Ernest Overton independently noticed that the chemicals which act as general anesthetics are also those soluble in both water and oil. They interpreted this as meaning that to pass the cell membrane a molecule must be at least sparingly soluble in oil, their “lipoid theory of narcosis.” Based on this evidence and further experiments, they concluded that the cell membrane might be made of lecithin (phosphatidylcholine) and cholesterol. Interestingly, one of the early criticisms of this theory was that it included no mechanism for energy-dependent selective transport. This “flaw” would remain unanswered <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> century until the discovery that specialized molecules called integral membrane proteins can act as ion transportation pumps.|$|E

500|$|Sir Henry Joseph Wood [...] (3 March 186919 August 1944) was an English {{conductor}} {{best known}} for his association with London's annual series of promenade concerts, known as the Proms.

500|$|In an open public letter {{also signed}} by Apollo {{veterans}} Jim Lovell and Gene Cernan, he noted, [...] "For The United States, the leading space faring nation <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> century, {{to be without}} carriage to low Earth orbit and with no human exploration capability to go beyond Earth orbit for an indeterminate time into the future, destines our nation {{to become one of}} second or even third rate stature". Armstrong had also publicly recalled his initial concerns about the Apollo11 mission, when he had believed there was only a 50 percent chance of landing on the Moon. [...] "I was elated, ecstatic and extremely surprised that we were successful", he later said.|$|E
500|$|The {{town was}} {{authorised}} to tender construction and operation {{to one or}} more contractors. It quickly chose the only serious candidate, Gustav Palmer Harding, a British citizen. He was the continental representative of Merryweather & Sons, builders of steam tram engines. This decision knitted the close railway links between the city and Great Britain that remained <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> century. Naturally, Mr Harding wanted to promote his company's machines, so he long made his views known to the municipal authorities. Finally convinced, they authorised him to use steam power from Maromme (Line 1), entering service on 29 December 1877. Merryweather & Sons, whose depot was on the Avenue du Mont-Riboudet, provided the tram units. Small and light — [...] — these reversible locomotives had two coupled axles, fully covered by a wooden body. They looked the same as a normal carriage so as not to frighten the horses. These steam carriages had enclosed lower decks; the upper decks were roofed but had open sides.|$|E
