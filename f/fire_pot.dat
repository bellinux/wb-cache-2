25|$|A bee smoker, {{usually called}} simply a smoker, is a device used in {{beekeeping}} to calm honey bees. It {{is designed to}} generate smoke from the smouldering of various fuels, hence the name. The first bee smoker, which incorporated a bellows with a <b>fire</b> <b>pot,</b> was invented in 1870 by the renowned American beekeeper, Moses Quinby.|$|E
25|$|The simple shapes {{made by the}} {{tinsmith}} require tools {{similar to}} a coppersmith. In addition to the big shears anchored in {{a hole in his}} bench he used hand snips and nippers for cutting. The tin was flattened on an anvil made of a block of steel. Straight and curved anvils (stakes) were used to turn and roll the edges of the tin. Solder was then used to join the pieces together; a soldering iron and <b>fire</b> <b>pot</b> were needed to do this.|$|E
25|$|During this stage, he is a {{said to have}} practised some {{technique}} of meditation that would seemingly help him control elements (called tattva) like fire and {{water out of the}} total 36 such elements enumerated in Kashmir Shaivism. He started the practice of blowing air at live charcoals in his <b>fire</b> <b>pot</b> (called kanger in local language) sometimes for hours together. He was found talking to and directing invisible people at times. Various parts of his body like his shoulders and knees were seen shuddering at times. He spiritually initiated a Sikh disciple who had come to see him from some other state and lived at his home for 3 months. He also initiated Pandit Maheshwar Nath Zutshi of Mallapore locality of Srinagar by offering him his pipe. He also started the practice of transfixing his gaze on water filled in a tumbler kept inside a brass basin filled with water. This brass basin was placed over an earthenware pot which too was filled with water. It was also during this time that majority of his miracles were recorded and people started flocking him, seeking solutions to their worldly problems. It was sometime during the period between 1946–56 that he came to be called as Bhagwan by his devotees. He regularly visited the shrines of the deities of Mata Sharika Bhagwati and Mata Ragnya Bhawani during this period. Sometime after 1957, on every Sunday afternoon, musical concerts were held at his place by known local musicians who would play local and Indian classical music for him. Some of the other shrines visited by him during the initial and final stages of his spiritual practice were Jwala Ji at Khrew, Bhadrakali at Handwara, Jyestha Bhagwati at Srinagar, Gupt Ganga near Nishat Bagh, Tushkaraja Bhairav at Srinagar and Amarnath.|$|E

2500|$|He {{would keep}} incense sticks burning in flames {{instead of letting}} them {{smoulder}} as he had an affinity for light sources.

He would refer to his legs as mere [...] "logs of wood" [...] and the body as [...] "food" [...] for the God of death (Mahakal) and as such didn't consider physical body as the end-all be-all of human existence.|$|E

The Museum of the Coastal Bend in Victoria, Texas also has many artifacts from the La Belle, mainly the other seven cannons from Fort St. Louis.|$|E
2500|$|The {{etymology}} of Erode {{is attributed}} to multiple theories. It might have its origin in the Tamil phrase Eru Odai meaning two streams based {{on the presence of}} two water courses, Perumpallam and Kalingarayan Canal. The name might have also been derived from Tamil phrase [...] "Eera Odu" [...] meaning wet skull. Dakshaprajapathi, who married his daughter to Hindu god Shiva, conducted a yajna for which Shiva was not invited. Shiva's wife Dakshyayini attended the ritual against the wish of her husband and she was not welcomed by her parents without her husband. Enraged at this, she threw herself in <b>fire</b> <b>pot</b> and burned to ashes. Shiva became agitated and threw everyone present at the ritual including Brahma, the Hindu god of creation into the sacrificial pot. The skulls and bones were later thrown in river Kaveri which remained wet.|$|E

2500|$|The Portuguese {{were able}} {{to fend off the}} smaller crafts with hand grenades, but they made little effect on the {{floating}} tower, which grappled the poop deck. Up to this point the Portuguese casualties had been few, with only four or five Portuguese along with a few Africans and lascars killed, while the Japanese dead were estimated at several hundred. However, six hours into the fighting, a shot from the tower-junk hit a <b>fire</b> <b>pot</b> that a Portuguese soldier was about to throw, smashing it onto the gunpowder at his feet. This started a conflagration that spread through the deck and set the mizzen sail ablaze. Pessoa and his men retreated to the forecastle, where they realized {{that they did not have}} enough men to simultaneously fight the fire and the Japanese boarders. At this point Pessoa ordered the ship's magazine to be set on fire since he would rather die than surrender. When the ship's purser hesitated, Pessoa cast away his sword and shield and picked up a crucifix, then he exclaimed: [...] "Blessed be thou, oh Lord, since thou willest that all this should end!" [...] He then told his crew to save themselves as he went down to start the fire himself. The Nossa Senhora da Graça then blew up in two successive explosions, split into two, and sank with cargo, crew, and boarders alike. The Japanese killed all they could see swimming in the water, but a few survivors made it onto the shore to safety. André Pessoa's body, however, was never found.|$|E

50|$|Given the {{time-consuming}} {{nature of}} early firestarting, humans eventually {{began to use}} earthenware vessels, or <b>fire</b> <b>pots,</b> in which slow-burning fires could by kept alight indefinitely by using small quantities of fuel.

50|$|When {{the pots}} are {{loaded into the}} kiln, wood gatherers bring in wood by the {{truckload}} for this firing. The wood comes {{from as far away}} as 60 kilometers, and is generally harder wood. The firing process differs from western firing because the fire master does not know the specific temperatures that they <b>fire</b> <b>pots</b> to. Instead, they measure how long to <b>fire</b> these <b>pots</b> for based on how many truckloads of wood they have to use and the duration. Although every wood kiln firing is different, they tend to fire for two days and use four truckloads of wood.|$|R
