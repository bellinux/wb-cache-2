25|$|Director of {{photography}} Rodrigo Prieto {{indicated that the}} film was shot in two distinct visual styles: scenes featuring the media were shot in the anamorphic format on 35mm film, while scenes focusing on the world of politics were shot in high-definition video with the Panavision Genesis <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>camera.</b> Hand-held cameras have been used. For color management, Prieto employed Gamma & Density Company's 3cP color management and correction software, using the American Society of Cinematographers' Color Decision List to keep color consistent throughout shooting, dailies, post and digital intermediate finishing process. The digital effects were handled by Rhythm and Hues.|$|E
500|$|Fiberoptic layngoscopes {{have become}} {{increasingly}} available since the 1990s. In contrast to the conventional laryngoscope, these devices allow the laryngoscopist to indirectly view the larynx. This provides a significant advantage in situations where the operator needs to see around an acute bend in order to visualize the glottis, and deal with otherwise difficult intubations. Video laryngoscopes are specialized fiberoptic layngoscopes that use a <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> sensor to allow the operator to view the glottis and larynx on a video monitor. Other [...] "noninvasive" [...] devices which can be employed to assist in tracheal intubation are the laryngeal mask airway (used as a conduit for endotracheal tube placement) and the Airtraq.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The use of <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>cameras</b> and <b>digital</b> still cameras is {{becoming}} widespread. <b>Digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>cameras</b> differ from <b>digital</b> still cameras {{in a number}} of respects. <b>Digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>cameras</b> capture approximately thirty frames per second and are optimized to capture a large amount of moving images, but sacrifice image quality. Still digital cameras are less expensive because they have far less processing power and memory capacity than <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>cameras.</b> Even with these limitations, some still digital cameras are also capable of capturing sequential images, such as a burst image. Accordingly, what is needed is a method and system for interactively creating a VIDEO from one or more still images...|$|R

Another crucial {{advantage}} to digital video was its cheapness: [...] "Ten years ago, we couldn’t have made this movie, because we would have had to shoot on film. It would have been as boring as bat shit, because we would only have had money to shoot a wide shot and two close ups before moving on. I got so much better coverage shooting it this way." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{even saw}} the Aurora take off one night - or an {{aircraft}} {{that matched the}} Aurora's reputed configuration, a sharp delta with twin tails about a hundred and thirty feet long. It taxied out of a lighted hangar at two-thirty A.M. and used a lot of runway to take off. It had one red light on top, but the minute the wheels left the runway, the light went off {{and that was the}} last I saw of it. I didn't hear it because the wind was blowing from behind me toward the base." [...] I asked when this had taken place. [...] "February 1994. Obviously they didn't think anybody was out there. It was thirty below zero - probably ninety below with the wind chill factor. I had hiked into White Sides from a different, harder way than usual, and stayed there two or three days among the rocks, under a camouflage tarp with six layers of clothes on. I had an insulated face mask and two sleeping bags, so I didn't present a heat signature. I videotaped the aircraft through a telescope with a five-hundred-millimeter f4 lens coupled via a C-ring to a high-eight <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> with five hundred and twenty scan lines of resolution, which is better than TV." [...] The author then asked, [...] "Where's the tape?" [...] "Locked away. That's a legitimate spyplane; my purpose is not to give away legitimate national defense. When they get ready to unveil it, I'll probably release the tape." ...|$|E
