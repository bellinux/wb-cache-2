25|$|Plato first {{articulated}} the emission theory, {{the idea that}} visual perception is accomplished by rays emitted by the eyes. He also commented on the parity reversal of mirrors in Timaeus. Some hundred years later, Euclid wrote a treatise entitled Optics where he linked vision to geometry, creating geometrical optics. He based his work on Plato's emission theory wherein he described the mathematical rules of perspective and described the effects of refraction qualitatively, although he questioned that {{a beam of light}} from the eye could instantaneously light up the stars <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>someone</b> blinked. Ptolemy, in his treatise Optics, held an extramission-intromission theory of vision: the rays (or flux) from the eye formed a cone, the vertex being within the eye, and the base defining the visual field. The rays were sensitive, and conveyed information back to the observer’s intellect about the distance and orientation of surfaces. He summarised much of Euclid and went on to describe a way to measure the angle of refraction, though he failed to notice the empirical relationship between it and the angle of incidence.|$|E

While at the dining table one evening, Paul McCartney brought out a booklet that displayed all the songs to which he owned the publishing rights. [...] "This is the way to make big money", the musician informed Jackson. [...] "Every time someone records one of these songs, I get paid. <b>Every</b> <b>time</b> <b>someone</b> plays these songs on the radio, or in live performances, I get paid."

I was hit with belts. So was the kid next door. It was just the way it was. Many of the children I've seen were broken by their parents, which was the German-Austrian mentality. They didn't want to create an individual. It was all about conforming. I was one who did not conform, and whose will could not be broken. Therefore, I became a rebel.

6000|$|... "Sally {{was beside}} herself with grief. For three days she screamed and cried. The natives {{did what they}} could to comfort her, {{but she would not}} be comforted. She would not eat. And then, exhausted, she sank into a sullen apathy. She spent long days at the cove, {{watching}} the lagoon, in the vain hope that Red somehow or other would manage to escape. She sat on the white sand, hour after hour, with the tears running down her cheeks, and at night dragged herself wearily back across the creek to the little hut where she had been happy. The people with whom she had lived before Red came to the island wished her to return to them, but she would not; she was convinced that Red would come back, and she wanted him to find her where he had left her. Four months later she was delivered of a still-born child, and the old woman who had come to help her through her confinement remained with her in the hut. All joy was taken from her life. If her anguish with time became less intolerable it was replaced by a settled melancholy. You would not have thought that among these people, whose emotions, though so violent, are very transient, a woman could be found capable of so enduring a passion. She never lost the profound conviction that sooner or later Red would come back. She watched for him, and <b>every</b> <b>time</b> <b>someone</b> crossed this slender little bridge of coconut trees she looked. It might at last be he." ...|$|E

40|$|Now a {{days there}} is great amount of {{information}} available due {{to the development of}} Internettechnologies. <b>Every</b> <b>time</b> when <b>someone</b> searches something on the Internet, the response obtained is a huge one with lots of information, which is impossible for a person to read completely. Hence one needs means of producing summaries of this information. Summarization is a very interesting and useful task which gives support to many other tasks like information extraction. It takes advantage of the techniques developed for Natural Language Processing tasks. In automatic text summarization most of the times the standard N gram model is used to develop the language model. The N gram models are unable to learn the grammatical relations of the sentences. Hence we propose to use the dependency grammar based noun phrase retrieval as a part of text preprocessing. This can be useful to learn the grammatical rules and thereby may be helpful to extract fundamental semantic units from the natural language text...|$|R

40|$|Almost <b>every</b> <b>time</b> that <b>someone</b> {{compares the}} {{translation}} of a text with its original, {{the quality of the}} translation is rarely awarded with overall positive comments: there is always ‘something missing’, there are always some aspects of the original that are inevitably ‘left behind’, even when it is recognized that the translator ‘has done a remarkable job’. Whenever someone compares a text to its translation, there is always a feeling that the ‘original text has lost many of its qualities in translation’. There are far too many examples which could evidently support this type of assertions, both in literary texts and in texts of other linguistic genres, due not only to the specific cultural and grammatical differences between the source and target languages concerned, but also, sometimes, to the inattention or inaccuracies of the translator(s) or of the automatic translation systems used to translate a text. The following paper aims to identify the reasons behind this ‘sense of loss’, and to suggest an alternative interpretation of it, by describing some practical examples of translation and by illustrating the ethical and theoretical implications involved in {{the translation of}} any text, in order to be fully aware and to re-evaluate the complexity and the importance of this process...|$|R
