A study estimated the overall annual cost of DST to Indiana households $9 million, with an additional $1.7–5.5 million for social costs <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>increased</b> pollution.|$|E
5|$|After {{initially}} {{making good}} returns for investors, the CLR suffered {{a decline in}} passenger numbers <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>increased</b> competition from other underground railway lines and new motorised buses.

5|$|Hurricane Karen was the {{eleventh}} named storm and fourth hurricane of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. Karen was a Cape Verde-type hurricane that {{developed in the}} eastern tropical Atlantic out of a large tropical wave.

As the storm remained away from land, no damages or fatalities were reported in association with Karen.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, {{residents}} of nearby settlements urged {{construction of the}} railway line to the proposed bridge site, but they were told this extension of the line was to be delayed. Within that year {{it was decided that}} a bridge was to be constructed <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>increased</b> traffic volume, and tenders were let for manufacture of the bridge spans, construction of abutments and piles, and transport of materials to the future construction site.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, the US {{state of}} North Carolina named the Scotch bonnet as its {{official}} state shell, {{in honor of}} the abundance of Scottish settlers that founded the state.

5|$|The {{major change}} in {{agriculture}} in Kerala occurred in the 1970s when production of rice fell <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>increased</b> availability of rice all over India and decreased availability of labour. Consequently, investment in rice production decreased and {{a major portion of}} the land shifted to the cultivation of perennial tree crops and seasonal crops. Profitability of crops fell due to a shortage of farm labour, the high price of land, and the uneconomic size of operational holdings.|$|E

5|$|The {{population}} growth rate was higher {{during the decade}} of 1981–90 <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>increased</b> provision of social, economic and recreational facilities that caused the rural population to migrate to urban areas. The overall growth rate had declined {{over the last two}} decades due to poor returns in agriculture and increased migration of agricultural labourers to other urban centres. The population density of the town is high in the centre and low in the peripheral regions.|$|E
5|$|A {{studbook}} {{was created}} for the breed in 1884, and was closed in 1922. A breeders' association was created in 1923. The {{first half of the}} 20th century saw declining populations of horses and mules <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>increased</b> mechanization, and, by 1945, Poitevin breeding was oriented towards the production of meat. The population dropped precipitously, and between 1970 and 1990 varied between 250 and 300 animals, with still lower levels seen in the early 1990s. A genetic study released in 1994 showed genetic bottlenecking and a severe risk of inbreeding, and led to the establishment of a conservation plan. Despite a slight increase in popularity {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century, the Poitevin is still in danger of extinction, with a slightly downward-trending population.|$|E
5|$|Advancements in {{microscopic}} stamping {{have led}} to a push for the inclusion of firing pin microstamping. The microstamp is etched onto the firing pin and is transferred to the cartridge during the firing process. Each firing pin would have a unique serial number allowing investigators to trace casings found at a crime scene to a known firearm. The practice is not in use , although California has enacted legislation that requires microstamping on all newly sold firearms. The law, and microstamping in general, has received significant opposition from gun manufacturers <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>increased</b> costs associated with introducing the microstamps into the manufacturing lines.|$|E

5|$|After France surrendered, Marcinkus {{managed to}} make his way to the French colonies in Africa (Morocco and Algeria). He decided to go to Great Britain and {{continue}} fighting, but the French army's terms of armistice at Compiègne and tensions between Britain and France made this difficult. On 12 August 1940 he was finally demobilized from the French army. Marcinkus and some of his associates concocted a daring plan to commandeer several aircraft without authorization and fly to England. The plan was not executed <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>increased</b> security at airfields and other circumstances. He finally received the necessary documents enabling him to go to Britain in autumn of 1940.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{industrial}} development quickened. New technology increased farm productivity through automation of feedlots for hogs and cattle, machine milking at dairy farms, and raising chickens in large buildings. Planting became more specialized with hybridization {{of corn and}} wheat, {{and the use of}} farm machinery such as tractors and combines became the norm. University of Minnesota professor Norman Borlaug contributed to these developments as part of the Green Revolution. Suburban development accelerated <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>increased</b> postwar housing demand and convenient transportation. Increased mobility, in turn, enabled more specialized jobs.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{regularly}} receives {{cold air}} from the south that can reach low latitudes owing {{to the influence of}} the Andes. Cold waves are usually accompanied with severe snowstorms or extremely cold conditions that can have a devastating impact on the country's economy. These snowstorms and/or extremely cold conditions can partially or completely paralyze activities in large areas of Patagonia and the center of the country. In addition, cold conditions can lead to energy shortages during the winter months <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>increased</b> demand. The low temperatures brought by these cold waves can cause frosts that can damage plants, severely affecting agricultural production and devastating the local economy.|$|E
