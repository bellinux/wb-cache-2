The MBTA was still accepting new cars from Boeing-Vertol, but the cars were falling out of service faster than the MBTA's maintenance staff could repair them. Additionally, the MBTA could not acquire replacement parts fast enough to repair the disabled LRVs. In a desperate effort to keep as many LRVs operating as possible, MBTA maintenance crews began cannibalizing some of the disabled cars for replacement parts. To help prevent the riding public from seeing the sheer number of brand-new, but heavily cannibalized LRVs, several of the cars were hidden around the system where the public was not likely to find them. A major newspaper story emerged when a reporter and a photographer managed to get into a section of the Green Line's subway which was not in use at the time and found it was full of cannibalized cars which had been abandoned in the tunnel. The MBTA had been towing the cars into the subway during the middle of the night when the subway was closed to the public. The story and photographs brought the problems with the LRV into the public eye for the first time. After the story broke, out-of-service LRVs began to appear in several storage yards which were easily viewed by the public, though this may have simply been due to the ever-increasing number of disabled cars.|$|E

Power quality management is a preventative process that focuses on identifying and correcting problems that cause bad power. Using cost-benefit analysis we compare the effects of implementing a power quality management program at AIMD Lemoore and AIMD Fallon. The implementation of power quality management can result in wide scale logistical support changes in regards to the life cycle costs of maintaining the DoD's current inventory of sensitive electronic equipment. Power quality management provides logisticians the opportunity to reduce maintenance costs, reduce maintenance cycle times, and improve <b>fleet</b> operational <b>availability.</b> Our research identifies potential savings of $ 1. 5 million from reduced test bench maintenance costs and productivity increases, and recommends the DoD institutionalize the use of power quality management.

The major objective is to demonstrate how 2 M repair capability can save O&MN funding and decrease the Repair Turnaround (RTAT) for repairables.

40|$|AbstractThis article {{presents}} {{a mathematical model}} for barge transport planning on the river Rhine, {{which is part of}} a decision support system (DSS) recently taken into use by the Swiss company Omya. The system is operated by Omya’s regional office in Cologne, Germany, responsible for distribution planning at the regional distribution center (RDC) in Moerdijk, the Netherlands. The distribution planning is a vital part of supply chain management of Omya’s production of Norwegian high quality calcium carbonate slurry, supplied to European paper manufacturers. The DSS operates within a vendor managed inventory (VMI) setting, where the customer inventories are monitored by Omya, who decides upon the refilling days and quantities delivered by barges. The barge planning problem falls into the category of inventory routing problems (IRP) and is further characterized with multiple products, heterogeneous <b>fleet</b> with <b>availability</b> restrictions (the <b>fleet</b> is owned by third party), vehicle compartments, dependency of barge capacity on water-level, multiple customer visits, bounded customer inventories and rolling planning horizon. There are additional modelling details which had to be considered to make it possible to employ the model in practice at a sufficient level of detail. To the best of our knowledge, {{we have not been able}} to find similar models covering all these aspects in barge planning.

40|$|Abstract only. The 2010 Annual Economic Report (AER) on the European Union (EU) fishing fleet, due for {{publication}} {{in the summer of}} 2010, will provide the most comprehensive overview to date on the structure and economic performance of the EU Member States fishing fleets. For the first time, the data used to compile all the various analyses contained within the report will be collected under the Data Collection Framework (DCF). The economic component of the new DCF is a significant improvement compared to its predecessor (the Data Collection Regulation (DCR)), {{at least in terms of}} parameter definitions and suggested calculation methodologies, which in turn should improve the quality of the analyses undertaken. In addition to presenting the key findings of the 2010 AER, this paper will pay particular attention to the impact of income subsidies on the profitability of the sector. In 2007, the EU fleet (excluding Portuguese and Spanish fleets) is reported to have generated combined profits of around 865 million Euros (cf. 2009 AER). However, the recent EC green paper on the future of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) reform states that most of Europes fishing fleets are either running losses or returning low profits. As a result of the introduction of the DCF, the 2010 AER should, for the first time, include new data on the amount of direct subsidies received by each Member States fishing <b>fleet.</b> The <b>availability</b> of this information will give a much clearer picture of the real level of profitability in the EU fleet and will undoubtedly have significant policy implications...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedWith the U.

This research suggests that submarines have the capability to communicate a signal to an opponent state by temporarily revealing themselves tactically. This signal of hidden capacity can be tailored into a tacit bargaining strategy that can significantly influence rival navies. By examining the development of naval diplomacy over the last two hundred years, this thesis critically reexamines U.

In examining Russian, British, and Chinese attempts to signal adversaries using submarines, this thesis provides context for the capacity submarines have in today’s naval diplomatic setting to force large changes in opponents’ strategic frameworks at low cost to the initiators. Because of these findings, this thesis recommends increased evaluation of such activities from a diplomatic and strategic perspective and increased awareness that such signals may be aimed at our military.

40|$|Integrated vehicle health {{management}} {{is a major}} component in a new, future fleet-management paradigm where a conscious effort is made to shift aircraft maintenance from a schedule-based approach to a more proactive and predictive approach (that is, condition-based maintenance). Its goal is to maximize <b>fleet</b> operational <b>availability</b> while minimizing the logistics footprint through monitoring of the deterioration of equipment conditions. A comprehensive integrated vehicle health-management system will be executed {{in an environment that}} includes different sensor technologies, multiple information systems, and different data models. Integrated vehicle healthmanagement implementers have to therefore deal with an integration problem that involves different specialized algorithms and embedded hardware platforms. Integrated vehicle {{health management}} applications will have common execution logic, and many will share the same data-processing algorithms; hence, development productivity and the quality of integrated vehicle health management applications can be increased through reusable software building blocks and algorithm libraries or, in particular, by using a software development framework. This paper presents an approach to distributed integrated vehicle health management systems that offers reusable software architecture for a class of integrated vehicle health management applications. The focus of this paper deals with an open software framework for development of integrated vehicle health management applications stemming from the open system architecture for a condition-based maintenance specification, which is an architecture-promoting interoperability and a component framework that enables reuse, data-process partitioning, configuration, and rapid prototyping. The framework is developed using Java and Internet communications engines' distributed middleware, and its application is demonstrated through a gearbox health-monitoring system, where the integrated vehicle health management software is deployed on the distributed embedded devices. This approach provides software-enabled capability to distribute/reconfigure the integrated vehicle health management data process (through the open system architecture for condition-based maintenance common interface and data model) across the hardware platforms to meet the given system configuration.
