25|$|The {{railroad}} {{was thus}} rendered inoperable, and {{what remained of}} it was transferred to Israel Railways upon the company's founding. The company made minor repairs along the line, which allowed trains to travel between Haifa and Afula. Service on the new shortened line was terminated in 1949. Two main reasons were the lack of <b>financial</b> <b>feasibility,</b> and the non-standard narrow gauge of the railway. In 1950-51, the line was used occasionally for tourism. Its last use was registered in September 1951, for training exercises by the Israel Defense Forces. In 1954, the rolling stock was dismantled and sold. An old steam locomotive and a single train car were the only remains, and are displayed at the Israel Railway Museum. A short section of the railway from the Haifa East rail yard to Nesher continued operating past 1951, having been converted by the British in the 1920s to dual gauge {{in order to allow}} standard gauge equipment to reach the Nesher cement factory, although this section too was eventually abandoned in the 1990s.|$|E
500|$|Public policy {{determines the}} extent to which {{renewable}} energy (RE) is to be incorporated into a developed or developing country's generation mix. Energy sector regulators implement that policy—thus affecting the pace and pattern of RE investments and connections to the grid. Energy regulators often have authority to carry out a number of functions that have implications for the <b>financial</b> <b>feasibility</b> of renewable energy projects. [...] Such functions include issuing licenses, setting performance standards, monitoring the performance of regulated firms, determining the price level and structure of tariffs, establishing uniform systems of accounts, arbitrating stakeholder disputes (like interconnection cost allocations), performing management audits, developing agency human resources (expertise), reporting sector and commission activities to government authorities, and coordinating decisions with other government agencies. [...] Thus, regulators make a wide range of decisions that affect the financial outcomes associated with RE investments. In addition, the sector regulator {{is in a position to}} give advice to the government regarding the full implications of focusing on climate change or energy security. [...] The energy sector regulator is the natural advocate for efficiency and cost-containment throughout the process of designing and implementing RE policies. [...] Since policies are not self-implementing, energy sector regulators become a key facilitator (or blocker) of renewable energy investments.|$|E

Biosecurity {{remains one of the}} most important means of reducing risks of infection in the household poultry, however not much information is available to support its feasibility at the household level of production. In this study <b>financial</b> <b>feasibilities</b> of biosecurity were modeled and evaluated based on certain production parameters. Risks of particular importance to the household poultry were categorized and highly pathogenic avian influenza H 5 N 1 was the most risky disease while people-related risk was the most important risk category.

Sensitivity analyses proved that the household poultry project was robust and would withstand various uncertainties. An uptake pathway for basic biosecurity was suggested. The outcome of this work should support decisions to implement biosecurity at the household sector of poultry production.

Two previous EUROMOD working papers have studied some of the effects and <b>financial</b> <b>feasibilities</b> {{of a variety of}} Citizenâ€™s Income schemes. 2 The advent of EUROMOD G 3. 0, and the availability of new FRS data, has made possible a more up to date evaluation of one of the schemes discussed in the second of the earlier working papers: a strictly revenue neutral scheme that could be paid for by raising Income Tax rates by 3 %, by abolishing Income Tax Personal Allowances, and by making adjustments to National Insurance Contributions, and that would leave in place the existing social security structure and reduce householdsâ€™ means-tested benefits by taking into account their Citizenâ€™s Incomes. The earlier working papers show that such a scheme would impose almost no disposable income losses on low income households at the point of implementation, and would impose only manageable losses on households in general.

2500|$|Another project {{which the}} Federal City Council {{supported}} was {{construction of the}} MCI Center (now the Verizon Center) in Chinatown. Along with the Greater Washington Board of Trade and other private groups, the Federal City Council—not public officials, fans, or sports interests—pushed for a new arena downtown. Abe Pollin {{was the owner of}} the Washington Capitals and Washington Bullets, professional hockey and basketball teams (respectively) which played at the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland. But the Capital Centre was a small, aging facility, and there seemed an opportunity to bring the teams back into the District of Columbia. The effort began in the summer of 1993, when Federal City Council president Ann Dore McLaughlin had a casual conversation with Gordon Gund, owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers professional basketball team, and learned of the [...] "Cleveland model" [...] for a public-private partnership to build a basketball arena in downtown Cleveland, Ohio. McLaughlin later shared this information with then-D.C. Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly, who was enthusiastic but emphasized that the private sector must take the lead on the effort. McLaughlin began having talks with Pollin's friends and associates, and members of Pollin's staff. In early November, the Board of Trade sought and won a meeting with Pollin. Pollin said he had received several offers to sell both teams, and was likely to do so unless a first-class sports arena could be built. On December 16, the Federal City Council hosted a meeting with the Board of Trade, Chamber of Commerce, and city officials to decide to take action. The Federal City Council, Board of Trade, and D.C. Chamber of Commerce agreed at the meeting to jointly conduct a study of the arena issue. The study identified several challenges, but also discovered that many sports teams were moving back into downtown areas from suburban sites. The study also identified several potential sites for the new arena. The city dropped out of the project so as not to appear to be raiding another jurisdiction's sports teams. The Greater Washington Board of Trade initially led talks with Pollin, which began in mid-January, until Maryland officials pointed out that—as a representative of businesses in Maryland and Virginia, not just D.C.—the group had a conflict of interest. Wanting to bring the sports teams back to the city, the Federal City Council took over the talks and successfully convinced Pollin to move his teams. The Federal City Council hired several nationally known sports arena and financial consultants to conduct research into the <b>financial</b> <b>feasibility</b> of the proposed arena. These consultants also participated in talks with Pollin. The Federal City Council also successfully pressed the city to provide financing for the project and to help clear away permitting and construction hurdles. Construction on the MCI Center began in 1994 and ended in 1995.|$|E
