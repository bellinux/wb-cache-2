5|$|Adults who <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> zero is even can {{nevertheless}} be {{unfamiliar with}} {{thinking of it}} as even, enough so to measurably slow them down in a reaction time experiment. Stanislas Dehaene, {{a pioneer in the}} field of numerical cognition, led a series of such experiments in the early 1990s. A numeral or a number word is flashed to the subject on a monitor, and a computer records the time it takes the subject to push one of two buttons to identify the number as odd or even. The results showed that 0 was slower to process than other even numbers. Some variations of the experiment found delays as long as 60 milliseconds or about 10% of the average reaction time—a small difference but a significant one.|$|E

25|$|Michelacci and Schivardi {{a pair of}} {{researchers}} who believe that identifying and comparing the relationships between an entrepreneur's earnings and education level would determine the rate and level of success. Their study focused on two education levels, college degree and post-graduate degree. While Michelacci and Schivardi do not specifically determine characteristics or traits for successful entrepreneurs, they <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{there is a direct}} relationship between education and success, noting that having a college degree does contribute to advancement in the workforce.|$|E

2500|$|William James' {{views were}} ambivalent. While he {{believed}} in free will on [...] "ethical grounds", he <b>did</b> not <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> there was evidence for it on scientific grounds, nor did his own introspections support it, he <b>did</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the problem of free will was a metaphysical issue and, therefore, could not be settled by science. Moreover, he did not accept incompatibilism as formulated below; he <b>did</b> not <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the indeterminism of human actions was a prerequisite of moral responsibility. In his work Pragmatism, he wrote that [...] "instinct and utility between them can safely be trusted {{to carry on the}} social business of punishment and praise" [...] regardless of metaphysical theories. He <b>did</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> indeterminism is important as a [...] "doctrine of relief" [...] – it allows for the view that, although the world may be in many respects a bad place, it may, through individuals' actions, become a better one. Determinism, he argued, undermines meliorism – the idea that progress is a real concept leading to improvement in the world.|$|R

Anti-Semitism predates the birth of Israel. Neither Israel's policies nor the critics of those policies should {{be held responsible for}} anti-Semitism. At the same time, I <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> attitudes toward Israel are influenced by Israel's policies, and attitudes toward the Jewish community are influenced by the pro-Israel lobby's success in suppressing divergent views.|$|E
25|$|Strmiska {{argues that}} these two poles could be termed reconstructionism and eclecticism, respectively. Reconstructionists do not {{altogether}} reject innovation in their interpretation and adaptation of the source material, however they <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the source material conveys greater authenticity and thus should be emphasized. They often follow scholarly debates {{about the nature of}} such pre-Christian religions, and some reconstructionists are themselves scholars. Eclectic Pagans, conversely, seek general inspiration from the pre-Christian past, and do not attempt to recreate past rites or traditions with specific attention to detail.|$|E

25|$|Ampelographers <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Carignan {{is likely}} {{a very old}} variety due to its {{widespread}} plantings {{and the proliferation of}} numerous different synonyms that give testament to the grape's long history in different wine regions. The grape likely originated in the Aragon region of northwest Spain where it possibly named after the town of Cariñena in the province of Zaragoza. However, in Zaragoza and other parts of Catalonia, the grape is sometimes called Samsó which is also used as a synonym for the French wine grape Cinsault adding to confusion to Carignan's history in the region. Another Spanish synonym, Mazuelo which is used in the Rioja wine region, is believed by ampelographers and wine historians to come from the commune of Mazuela in the province of Burgos in the Castile and León region of northwest Spain.|$|E

5000|$|St. Augustine had a {{very deep}} sense of the {{difficulty}} of the problem presented by this tract. He asked the question [...] "I Am" [...] what? From John 8, 24: [...] "If you <b>do</b> not <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> I Am, you will die in your sins." [...] But Augustine asked, [...] "si non credideritis quia ego sum?" [...] (I Am What?) There was nothing added. Augustine found this embarrassing. [...] "We were waiting for Him to say what He was, and He says nothing."

500|$|Tabloid {{criticism}} of Islam4UK and Choudary since {{news of the}} proposed march first became public has, generally, been vitriolic, calling him a [...] "hate preacher".

In October 2014, Norton claimed he chose never to play Hulk again because he [...] "wanted more diversity" [...] with his career, {{and did not want to}} be {{associated}} with only one character. In April 2012, despite Ruffalo being on board to play the Hulk in the sequel, Feige confirmed to Collider that Marvel had no plans at that time to film another Hulk film. In a Q session, Feige and Ruffalo confirmed that discussions are underway to produce another Hulk film due to the positive audience response to Ruffalo's performance in The Avengers.

500|$|Sharp {{criticism}} from Catholic Church authorities put Ferraro {{on the defensive}} during the entire campaign, with abortion opponents frequently protesting her appearances {{with a level of}} fervor not usually encountered by pro-choice Catholic male candidates such as Mario Cuomo and Ted Kennedy. In a 1982 briefing for Congress, Ferraro had written that [...] "the Catholic position on abortion is not monolithic and there can be a range of personal and political responses to the issue." [...] Ferraro was criticized by Cardinal John O'Connor, the Catholic Archbishop of New York, and James Timlin, the Bishop of Scranton, for misrepresenting the Catholic Church's position on abortion. After several days of back-and-forth debate in the public media, Ferraro finally conceded that, [...] "the Catholic Church's position on abortion is monolithic" [...] but {{went on to say that}} [...] "But I <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> there are a lot of Catholics who do not share the view of the Catholic Church". Ferraro was also criticized for saying that Reagan was not a [...] "good Christian" [...] because, she said, his policies hurt the poor. To defend Ferraro, the pro-choice group Catholics for a Free Choice placed an October 7, 1984, full-page ad in The New York Times titled [...] "A Catholic Statement on Pluralism and Abortion".|$|E
500|$|The Laming {{report was}} criticised by Caroline Abrahams and Deborah Lightfoot of NCH as too narrow, {{focusing}} {{too much on}} the particular case of Victoria Climbié and not on general child protection. According to Harry Ferguson, a professor of social work at the University of the West of England, [...] "Laming's report focuses too heavily on the implementation of new structures and fails to understand the keen intuition that child protection work demands". He criticised the approach to child protection of focusing {{too much on the}} worst cases and trying too much to prevent them, rather than having an approach that also celebrates success; and said that focusing too much on any individual case and basing reforms on that was [...] "deeply problematic". Laming responded to criticism by the Association of Directors of Social Services that his recommendations would require much more funding by saying that these arguments lacked [...] "intellectual rigour", and he dismissed claims that his reforms would be too bureaucratic. The Guardian said that the report does not address the issues of frontline staff. Deryk Mead of NCH said, [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> inquiry reports have made a positive difference to the child protection system, and I have every confidence that Lord Laming's report will do so too".|$|E
