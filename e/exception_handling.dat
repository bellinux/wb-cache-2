Van Rossum is Python's principal author, and his continuing central role in deciding the direction of Python {{is reflected in the}} title given to him by the Python community, Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL).|$|E
5|$|PHP 5 {{introduced}} {{private and}} protected member variables and methods, along with abstract classes, final classes, abstract methods, and final methods. It also introduced a standard way of declaring constructors and destructors, {{similar to that}} of other object-oriented languages such as C++, and a standard <b>exception</b> <b>handling</b> model. Furthermore, PHP 5 added interfaces and allowed for multiple interfaces to be implemented. There are special interfaces that allow objects to interact with the runtime system. Objects implementing ArrayAccess can be used with array syntax and objects implementing Iterator or IteratorAggregate can be used with the foreach language construct. There is no virtual table feature in the engine, so static variables are bound with a name instead of a reference at compile time.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose to}} add a fixed-point {{combinator}} to a -calculus of <b>exceptions</b> <b>handling</b> whose type system corresponds to classical logic through the CurryHoward isomorphism. To this end, we here give a CPS-semantics to the calculus and show that for non-exceptional terms, this semantics possesses the property of computational adequacy. 1 Introduction In [de Groote, 1995] Philippe de Groote proposed a computational interpretation of classical logic through a simply typed -calculus which features an <b>exceptions</b> <b>handling</b> mechanism inspired by the ML language. This calculus has several interesting properties among others: strong normalisation, confluence and subject reduction, {{the greater part of}} them being given by its typing system which ensures that every raised <b>exception</b> is eventually <b>handled</b> whenever the whole term is correctly typed. Our goal consists in seeing if this interpretation can provide a realistic system of <b>exceptions</b> <b>handling,</b> with emphasis on the study of its behaviour in the p [...] ...|$|R

25|$|The {{point of}} <b>exception</b> <b>handling</b> {{routines}} {{is to ensure}} that the code can handle error conditions. In order to establish that <b>exception</b> <b>handling</b> routines are sufficiently robust, it is necessary to present the code with a wide spectrum of invalid or unexpected inputs, such as can be created via software fault injection and mutation testing (that is also sometimes referred to as fuzz testing). One of the most difficult types of software for which to write <b>exception</b> <b>handling</b> routines is protocol software, since a robust protocol implementation must be prepared to receive input that does not comply with the relevant specification(s).|$|E
25|$|Contemporary {{applications}} face many {{design challenges}} when considering <b>exception</b> <b>handling</b> strategies. Particularly in modern enterprise level applications, exceptions must often cross process boundaries and machine boundaries. Part of designing a solid <b>exception</b> <b>handling</b> strategy is recognizing when a process {{has failed to}} the point where it cannot be economically handled by the software portion of the process.|$|E

40|$|The BSML (Bulk Synchronous ML) {{language}} is a data-parallel functional language for programming BSP (Bulk Synchronous algorithms) algorithms in so-called direct mode. In a direct mode BSP algorithm, the physical structure of processes is made explicit. The execution time can then be estimated and dead-locks and indeterminism are avoided. The BSMLlib library, the current implementation of the BSML language, permits, {{as an extension of}} Objective Caml, the use of the <b>exceptions</b> <b>handling</b> mechanism that comes with this language. However, the interaction of Objective Caml exceptions with the BS#-calculus (the theoretical model underlying the BSML language) has not yet been studied and yields some safety issues. In particular, the use of collective synchronization operations needs the participation of all processes during the call to one of these operation, should the opposite occur, processes involved in this call are locked. The BSML language, without exceptions, ensures that all processes participate to such a call and thus that dead-locks are avoided (except for process failure). When one introduces Objective Caml exceptions, this safety property does not hold any more. Thus it is needed to study a new semantics, suitable to <b>exceptions</b> <b>handling,</b> to recover this property. The present work introduces such a semantics in which the participation of all processes is ensured and dead-lock issues are avoided. We will also introduce a semantics allowing the pattern-matching of BSML parallel vectors. This semantics has been studied in the framework of a previous work on <b>exceptions</b> <b>handling</b> which has not been retained here but its functionalities will be nethertheless add to the BSML language...|$|R

25|$|It is also {{possible}} to raise exceptions purposefully, using the throw keyword; these <b>exceptions</b> are <b>handled</b> in the usual way. In some cases, exceptions cannot {{be used due to}} technical reasons. One such example is a critical component of an embedded system, where every operation must be guaranteed to complete within a specified amount of time. This cannot be determined with exceptions as no tools exist to determine the maximum time required for an <b>exception</b> to be <b>handled.</b>|$|R
25|$|The exception-causing code {{is placed}} inside a try block. The <b>exceptions</b> are <b>handled</b> in {{separate}} catch blocks (the handlers); each try block can have multiple exception handlers, {{as it is}} visible in the example below.|$|R
25|$|Go was {{initially}} released with <b>exception</b> <b>handling</b> explicitly omitted, with the developers {{arguing that it}} obfuscated control flow. Later, the exception-like / mechanism {{was added to the}} language, which the Go authors advise using only for unrecoverable errors that should halt the entire process.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{software}} <b>exception</b> <b>handling</b> {{included both}} resumable exceptions (resumption semantics), like most hardware exceptions, and non-resumable exceptions (termination semantics). However, resumption semantics were considered ineffective in {{practice in the}} 1970s and 1980s (see C++ standardization discussion, quoted below) and {{are no longer in}} common use, though provided by programming languages like Common Lisp and Dylan.|$|E
25|$|Windows {{specific}} compiler {{support is}} also needed for Structured <b>Exception</b> <b>Handling</b> (SEH). This system serves two purposes: {{it provides a}} substrate on which language-specific <b>exception</b> <b>handling</b> can be implemented, and it is how the kernel notifies applications of exceptional conditions such as dereferencing an invalid pointer or stack overflow. The Microsoft/Borland C++ compilers {{had the ability to}} use this system {{as soon as it was}} introduced in Windows 95 and NT, however the actual implementation was undocumented and had to be reverse engineered for the Wine project and free compilers. SEH is based on pushing exception handler frames onto the stack, then adding them to a linked list stored in thread local storage (the first field of the thread environment block). When an exception is thrown, the kernel and base libraries unwind the stack running handlers and filters as they are encountered. Eventually, every exception unhandled by the application will be dealt with by the default backstop handler, which pops up the Windows common crash dialog.|$|E

25|$|One case {{of early}} {{criticism}} against <b>Exception</b> <b>handling</b> {{was dealing with}} resource leaks or state inconsistence, such as escaping a section locked by a mutex, or one temporarily holding a file open.

25|$|An exception-handling {{language}} {{without this}} unwinding is Common Lisp with its Condition System. Common Lisp calls the exception handler {{and does not}} unwind the stack. This allows the program to continue the computation {{at exactly the same}} place where the error occurred (for example when a previously missing file has become available). The stackless implementation of the Mythryl programming language supports constant-time <b>exception</b> <b>handling</b> without stack unwinding.|$|E
25|$|To give {{compiler}} vendors greater freedom, the C++ {{standards committee}} {{decided not to}} dictate the implementation of name mangling, <b>exception</b> <b>handling,</b> and other implementation-specific features. The downside of this decision is that object code produced by different compilers {{is expected to be}} incompatible. There were, however, attempts to standardize compilers for particular machines or operating systems (for example C++ ABI), though they seem to be largely abandoned now.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model for}} exceptions and an approach for incorporating them in commitment protocols among autonomous agents. Modeling and <b>handling</b> <b>exceptions</b> is critical for successful applications of multiagent systems. Protocols help build multiagent systems, but traditional representations (such as finite state machines or Petri nets) inadequately model complex interactions and exceptions therein. Emerging commitment-based representations are promising, because they declaratively reflect the semantics of an interaction. However, current approaches lack a strong treatment of exceptions. This paper treats both expected and unexpected exceptions. A commitment protocol is modeled {{as a set of}} computations, each representing an allowed interaction and showing the evolving commitments of the participants. Exceptions are modeled via preference structures induced on these sets of computations. The preference structures statically show how expected <b>exceptions</b> are <b>handled</b> whereas the structures must be enhanced dynamically to <b>handle</b> unexpected <b>exceptions.</b> Our approach includes operators for composing protocols and exception handlers, whereby appropriate exception handlers can be dynamically introduced into a protocol as needed. The main contributions of this paper are (1) a framework for modeling and <b>handling</b> <b>exceptions</b> intelligently in commitment protocols and (2) a demonstration of the benefits of commitment protocols over traditional formalisms in <b>handling</b> <b>exceptions...</b>|$|R
