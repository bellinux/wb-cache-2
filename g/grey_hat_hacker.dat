A <b>grey</b> <b>hat</b> <b>hacker</b> may surf the Internet and hack into a {{computer}} system {{for the sole purpose}} of notifying the administrator that their system has a security defect, for example. They may then offer to correct the defect for a fee. Grey hat hackers sometimes find the defect of a system and publish the facts to the world instead of a group of people. Even though grey hat hackers may not necessarily perform hacking for their personal gain, unauthorized access to a system can be considered illegal and unethical.|$|E

Another {{definition of}} <b>Grey</b> <b>Hat</b> maintains that <b>Grey</b> <b>Hat</b> <b>hackers</b> only arguably violate the law in an effort to research and improve security: legality being set according to the particular ramifications of any hacks they participate in.|$|R

5000|$|The term {{began to}} be used in the late 1990s, derived from the {{concepts}} of [...] "white hat" [...] and [...] "black hat" [...] hackers.
