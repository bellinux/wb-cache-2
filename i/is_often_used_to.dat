5|$|Because of {{its high}} neutron cross-section, boron-10 <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> control fission in nuclear {{reactors}} as a neutron-capturing substance. Several industrial-scale enrichment processes have been developed; however, only the fractionated vacuum distillation of the dimethyl ether adduct of boron trifluoride (DME-BF3) and column chromatography of borates are being used.|$|E
5|$|Performing a chest {{radiograph}} {{is one of}} {{the first}} investigative steps if a person reports symptoms that may suggest lung cancer. This may reveal an obvious mass, widening of the mediastinum (suggestive of spread to lymph nodes there), atelectasis (collapse), consolidation (pneumonia) or pleural effusion. CT imaging is typically used to provide more information about the type and extent of disease. Bronchoscopy or CT-guided biopsy <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> sample the tumor for histopathology.|$|E
5|$|Schaeffer's {{chemical}} test <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> help identify and differentiate Agaricus species. In this test, aniline plus nitric acid {{are applied to}} the surface of the fruit body, and if positive, a red or orange color forms. Agaricus deserticola has a positive Schaeffer's reaction, similar to species in section Arvensis in the genus Agaricus.|$|E

5|$|Tile-based structures. This {{approach}} {{breaks the}} target structure into smaller units with strong binding between the strands contained in each unit, and weaker {{interactions between the}} units. It <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> make periodic lattices, but {{can also be used}} to implement algorithmic self-assembly, making them a platform for DNA computing. This was the dominant design strategy used from the mid-1990s until the mid-2000s, when the DNA origami methodology was developed.|$|E
5|$|Titanium nitride (TiN) has a {{hardness}} {{equivalent to}} sapphire and carborundum (9.0 on the Mohs Scale), and <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> coat cutting tools, such as drill bits. It {{is also used}} as a gold-colored decorative finish and as a barrier metal in semiconductor fabrication. Titanium carbide, which is also very hard, is found in cutting tools and coatings.|$|E
5|$|Genital herpes {{can be more}} {{difficult}} to diagnose than oral herpes, since most HSV-2-infected persons have no classical symptoms. Further confusing diagnosis, several other conditions resemble genital herpes, including fungal infection, lichen planus, atopic dermatitis, and urethritis. Laboratory testing <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> confirm a diagnosis of genital herpes. Laboratory tests include culture of the virus, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) studies to detect virus, skin biopsy, and polymerase chain reaction to test for presence of viral DNA. Although these procedures produce highly sensitive and specific diagnoses, their high costs and time constraints discourage their regular use in clinical practice.|$|E

5|$|In 1916, {{volunteering}} {{to stage a}} puppet show for the MTX members, she created a play with five puppets based loosely on the Petrushka folk character. Petrushka is a roguish character who <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> comment on contemporary society's social vices. The show was well received. She presented a repeat performance before receiving an invitation to stage the play once more at the Café Pittoresque, a well-known cabaret. Having lost her jester-like puppet, she wrote two new plays and performed them with her husband. They were adaptations of Ivan Krylov's fables The Hermit and the Bear and Two Mice. She gave several other performances with her husband, at cafés, friends' homes and at the Hermitage Theatre between 1916 and 1918.|$|E
5|$|Much {{research}} {{has been devoted to}} applications of photons in the field of quantum optics. Photons seem well-suited to be elements of an extremely fast quantum computer, and the quantum entanglement of photons is a focus of research. Nonlinear optical processes are another active research area, with topics such as two-photon absorption, self-phase modulation, modulational instability and optical parametric oscillators. However, such processes generally do not require the assumption of photons per se; they may often be modeled by treating atoms as nonlinear oscillators. The nonlinear process of spontaneous parametric down conversion <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> produce single-photon states. Finally, photons are essential in some aspects of optical communication, especially for quantum cryptography.|$|E
5|$|People {{identifying}} with Asperger syndrome may refer to themselves in casual conversation as aspies (a term first used in print by Liane Holliday Willey in 1999). The word neurotypical (abbreviated NT) describes a person whose neurological development and state are typical, and <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> refer to non-autistic people. The Internet has allowed individuals with AS {{to communicate with}} each other in a way that was not previously possible because of their rarity and geographic dispersal, forming a subculture composed of people with Asperger's. Internet sites like Wrong Planet have made it easier for individuals to connect.|$|E

5|$|Pre-moulded or {{machined}} components can be {{inserted into the}} cavity while the mould is open, allowing the material injected in the next cycle to form and solidify around them. This process is known as Insert moulding and allows single parts to contain multiple materials. This process <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> create plastic parts with protruding metal screws, allowing them to be fastened and unfastened repeatedly. This technique {{can also be used}} for In-mould labelling and film lids may also be attached to moulded plastic containers.|$|E
5|$|Sodium {{compounds}} {{have many}} applications, {{the most well-known}} being sodium chloride as table salt. Sodium salts of fatty acids are used as soap. Pure sodium metal also has many applications, including use in sodium-vapour lamps, which produce very efficient light compared to other types of lighting, and can help smooth the surface of other metals. Being a strong reducing agent, it <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> reduce many other metals, such as titanium and zirconium, from their chlorides. Furthermore, it is very useful as a heat-exchange liquid in fast breeder nuclear reactors due to its low melting point, viscosity, and cross-section towards neutron absorption.|$|E
5|$|The Mantoux {{tuberculin}} {{skin test}} <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> screen people {{at high risk}} for TB. Those who have been previously immunized may have a false-positive test result. The test may be falsely negative in those with sarcoidosis, Hodgkin's lymphoma, malnutrition, and most notably, active tuberculosis. Interferon gamma release assays, on a blood sample, are recommended in those who are positive to the Mantoux test. These are not affected by immunization or most environmental mycobacteria, so they generate fewer false-positive results. However, they are affected by M. szulgai, M. marinum, and M. kansasii. IGRAs may increase sensitivity when used in addition to the skin test, but may be less sensitive than the skin test when used alone.|$|E

5|$|The final island {{platform}} is shorter and only has east-end platforms 13 and 15: 15 {{is used by}} most trains from Paddington that continue westwards to Weston-super-Mare or beyond. Platform 13 is a terminus platform and is used by many trains from Paddington, some local services and occasionally by CrossCountry. There is another siding beyond platform 15 {{that used to be}} the In/Out Road for Bath Road Traction Maintenance Depot. This depot has been demolished. Between platforms 3/4 and 5/6 are the Up Through line and the Middle Siding, the latter <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> stable Mark 1 carriages between Torbay Express duties in the summer months. The Down Through line runs between platforms 11/12 and 13.|$|E
5|$|Video {{fluoroscopy}} uses {{x-ray radiation}} to produce moving {{pictures of the}} mouth during articulation or swallowing. It is considered the gold standard in studies of dysphagia because {{of its ability to}} take videos of the entire digestive tract during swallowing events. It <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> study and treat aspiration of food, what parts of the digestive tract are malfunctioning during swallowing, and positions in which swallowing is easiest. Only limited data is able to be collected as sessions are typically limited to three minutes due to the hazards of radiation exposure. and it does not allow for fine grain analysis of tongue movements.|$|E
5|$|When a nodule is present, thyroid {{function}} {{tests are}} performed and reveal {{whether a person}} has a normal amount of thyroid hormones ("euthyroid") or an excess of hormones, usually secreted by the nodule, causing hyperthyroidism. When the thyroid function tests are normal, an ultrasound <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> investigate the nodule, and provide information such as whether the nodule is fluid-filled or a solid mass, and whether the appearance is suggestive of a benign or malignant cancer. A needle aspiration biopsy may then be performed, and the sample undergoes cytology, in which the appearance of cells is viewed {{to determine whether they}} resemble normal or cancerous cells.|$|E
