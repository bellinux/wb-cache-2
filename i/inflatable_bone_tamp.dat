30|$|Anatomic {{reduction}} of intra-articular fractures of the tibial plateau and distal radius {{can be difficult}} to achieve. Treatment goals are centered on restoring the native anatomy and articular congruency. Several surgeons in the USA have begun using an <b>inflatable</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tamp</b> to reduce these fracture patterns. The concept is built on the success of the tamp in kyphoplasty of the spine, but it has yet to be tested in the lab for use in the extremities. We performed an investigation into the safety and efficacy of using an <b>inflatable</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tamp</b> for intra-articular fracture {{reduction of}} the tibial plateau and distal radius.|$|E
30|$|The <b>inflatable</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tamp</b> was {{equivalent}} to conventional methods in large, minimally displaced fracture fragments and proved superior when comminution {{was present at}} the articular surface. No instances of overreduction or penetration into the joint were encountered with the balloon, whereas this was a common occurrence with conventional metal tamps. The inflatable tamp was successful in reducing all distal radius fractures without complication.|$|E
30|$|The <b>inflatable</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tamp</b> appears {{promising}} {{in treating}} depressed intra-articular fractures of the tibial plateau and distal radius. It appears safe, as no instances of joint penetration, over-reduction, or balloon breakage occurred. In these regions, the balloon appears superior to conventional methods of reducing comminuted intra-articular fracture depressions and equivalent when elevating broad, minimally displaced, fragments. It offers {{the advantage of}} being minimally invasive and leaving behind a void of known size and volume. Many isolated joint depression fractures now treated nonoperatively could thus undergo a simple, minimally invasive procedure that would restore articular congruency with minimal morbidity. Caution should be used when generalizing {{the results of this study}} due to the small number of specimens used. In addition, we used cadaveric specimens, and the technique will need to be applied to actual patients. We have used the <b>inflatable</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tamp</b> in our trauma center with good success in > 20 patients. A clinical study will follow once adequate numbers and follow-up have been achieved.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: We prospectively {{evaluated}} {{the safety and}} efficacy of kyphoplasty {{in the treatment of}} osteolytic vertebral compression fractures resulting from multiple myeloma. The principle symptoms in multiple myeloma result from bone destruction, especially the spine. Kypho-plasty is a new technique that involves the introduction of <b>inflatable</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tamps</b> (IBT) into the vertebral body. The purpose of the IBT is to restore the vertebral body back toward its original height, while creating a cavity that can be filled with highly viscous bone cement. Patients and Methods: Fifty-five consecutive kypho-plasty procedures were performed in 18 patients with osteolytic vertebral compression fractures resulting from multiple myeloma. Cement leakage and any com-plications were recorded. Early objective analysis was made by comparing preoperative and latest Short Form 36 Health Survey scores. Height restoration was esti-mated by measuring vertebral height on lateral radiographs. Results: The mean age of patients was 63. 5 years, mean duration of symptoms was 11 months, and mean follow-up was 7. 4 months. There were no major com-plications related directly to use of this technique. On average, 34 % of height lost at the time of fracture was restored. Asymptomatic cement leakage occurred at two (4 %) of 55 levels. Significant improvement in SF 36 scores occurred for Bodily Pain (23. 2 to 55. 4,...|$|R
40|$|Study Design. A human cadaveric {{model was}} used to {{evaluate}} balloon vertebroplasty in traumatic vertebral fractures. Objectives. To assess the feasibility and safety of balloon vertebroplasty followed by calcium phosphate cement augmentation to prevent recurrent kyphosis. Summary of Background Data. Failure after short-segment pedicle-screw fixation for the treatment of vertebral fractures is probably caused by a redistribution of disc material through the fractured endplate into the vertebral body, causing a decrease in anterior column support. This lack of support can give rise to instrument breakage and recurrent kyphosis after removal of the instrumentation. Restoration of the endplate morphology could prevent these events. Methods. Twenty-three traumatic fractures of thoracolumbar vertebrae were created. All fractures were distracted and fixated with short-segment pedicle screws and rods. Transpedicularly introduced <b>inflatable</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tamps</b> and subsequent injection of calcium phosphate cement were used to restore the endplates. Quantitative analyses of magnetic resonance images obtained at three time points were used to evaluate the morphology of the vertebral body and disc-space. After slicing all specimens, macroscopical examination was performed to detect leakage of cement or bone displacement in undesired directions. Results. No technical problems were encountered during the study. The balloon vertebroplasty resulted in a significant (P = 0. 0014) decrease of cranial endplate impression. No cement leakage or undesired bone displacement could be detected radiologically or macroscopically. Conclusions. The present study suggests that balloon vertebroplasty may be a safe and feasible procedure for the restoration of traumatic thoracolumbar vertebral fractures...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Vertebral {{compression}} fractures often {{result in}} pain and vertebral deformity. We compared 2 different balloon kyphoplasty techniques both using intraoperative curettage. MATERIALSANDMETHODS: Adults 50 {{years of age or}} olderwith osteoporosis and 1 acute VCFwere randomized to undergo bilateral BKP in which the curette was used first (n 57) followed by <b>inflatable</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tamps</b> or in which IBTs were used first, followed by curettage and a second IBT inflation (n 55). RESULTS: Mean procedure duration was 33. 5 and 36. 8 minutes, and fluoroscopy duration was 3. 8 and 3. 7 minutes for the CF and IBTF groups, respectively. Two-thirds of VCFs were wedge-shaped, and one-half had dynamic mobility. Anterior height restored postopera-tivelywas 2. 28 mm (95 %CI, 1. 49 – 3. 08 mm; P. 001) and 2. 78 mm (95 %CI, 1. 89 – 3. 66 mm; P. 001) for CF and IBTF groups, representing 35 % and 39 % of lost height restored, but group differences were not significant (P. 4). Intraoperative anterior height gain attributed to dynamic mobility was 2. 96 mm (95 % CI, 1. 92 – 4. 00 mm; P. 001) and 3. 05 mm (95 % CI, 2. 10 – 4. 00 mm; P. 001); additional height attributed to IBT inflation was 1. 09 mm (95 % CI, 0. 77 – 1. 41 mm; P. 001) and 1. 25 mm (95 % CI, 0. 68 – 1. 82 mm; P. 001), representing a 37 % and 41 % increase. There was no significant height loss on IBT removal and cementation. Both groups had improved pain and ambulation. Asymp-tomatic leakage occurred in 15 % of VCFs. There was 1 nonserious device-related hematoma (IBTF group). One new clinical VCF occurred in each group, but they were not device-related...|$|R

30|$|Anatomic {{reduction}} of impacted articular fractures {{should be the}} goal of any treating surgeon. In our cadaveric models, we show the <b>inflatable</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tamp</b> to be equivalent to conventional methods (metal tamp or elevator) for reducing depressed intra-articular fractures with large fragments. It was superior to conventional methods for fractures with associated comminution. In addition, no instances of joint penetration were encountered, and over-reduction was not a complication. To our surprise, articular-surface overreduction and penetration was common with minimal force using conventional tamps. It is possible that this is often underappreciated intraoperatively using fluoroscopy.|$|E
30|$|We {{sought to}} test the safety and {{efficacy}} of an <b>inflatable</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tamp</b> in performing intra-articular fracture reductions. The tamp consists of a balloon that can be inflated within the bone and subsequently removed. Much success has been documented with this technique in the spine for percutaneous kyphoplasty. Recent case reports document the success of using the inflatable tamp in the extremities. These reports include treating fractures of the calcaneus, cuboid, distal radius, tibial plateau, and acetabulum [10 – 13]. Despite preliminary success in these case reports, no laboratory study has been performed to document the safety or efficacy of this method.|$|E

30|$|Paired cadaveric {{specimens}} {{were obtained}} {{for a total of}} six proximal tibias and six distal radii. Intra-articular depression-type fractures were created in all specimens. The <b>inflatable</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tamp</b> was then used to reduce the depression. For comparison, the tibias were fractured on the medial and lateral side and a conventional metal tamp was used on the contralateral side of the balloon. Fine-cut micro-computed tomography (CT) scans were performed on all intact specimens, which were then fractured, and again after fracture reduction. CT data was used to measure the amount of restoration of the normal anatomy and to compare the effectiveness of the balloon to conventional methods.|$|E
40|$|Two {{different}} {{minimally invasive}} percutaneous vertebral augmentation methods for cement application into the vertebral {{body for the}} management of symptomatic compression fractures without neurologic impairment have been developed, namely, vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. In vertebroplasty, polymethylmethacrylate cement is injected percutaneously into a collapsed vertebral body. Kyphoplasty involves placing an <b>inflatable</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tamp</b> percutaneously into a vertebral body. The inflation of the bone tamp with fluid allows restoration of vertebral height and correction of the kyphosis. After deflation, the cavity that has been produced is filled by injection of polymethylmethacrylate. This article provides an overview {{of the state of the}} art in vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, discussing the indications, techniques, results, and pitfalls...|$|E
40|$|Percutaneous vertebroplasty and balloon kyphoplas-ty {{are less}} {{invasive}} treatment options than open surgery {{for patients with}} vertebral compression frac-tures. With balloon kyphoplasty, the injection of bone cement is preceded by inflation and removal of <b>bone</b> <b>tamps</b> (balloons) inside the fractured vertebral body. This allows {{for the creation of}} a void, where viscous cement is delivered resulting in a lower risk for cement leakage than with vertebroplasty. Another advantage of the balloon inflation is the potential to correct the deformity and restore sagittal alignment. The percutaneous techniques normally require intact pedicles and intact posterior elements. We found that modifying the technique made it suit-able for the management of vertebra plana, traumat-ic fractures, and neoplasms. Our study documents the different modified techniques and the clinical results obtained within the first 21 patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} the use of kyphoplasty in 1998 {{was the result of the}} {{expected}} evolution of materials and methods related to the successful introduction of vertebroplasty as a valid treatment of painful vertebral compression fractures. Kyphoplasty introduced a method of creating bilateral bone voids and in many cases elevation (reduction) of depressed end plates with variable degrees of height restoration. This was achieved by using bilateral balloon <b>bone</b> <b>tamps</b> capable of pressures significantly higher than conventional angioplasty balloons. This allows creation of bilateral bone voids, resulting in the ability to apply a much thicker cement mixture. This is felt to be the reason for fewer cement-related complications compared with vertebroplasty including extravasation and embolization. Although the procedural cost presently is higher for kyphoplasty, this is expected to decrease as patents expire and industry competition increases. Kyphoplasty indications include all those of vertebroplasty plus additional ones either contraindicated or not recommended for treatment with vertebroplasty. Kyphoplasty achieves the same degree of pain relief as vertebroplasty but may offer additional benefits of fewer complications, more indications, better biopsy specimens, and potential for height restoration of compression fractures of the spine. Further studies regarding potential benefits are warranted to assess any added value of kyphoplasty compared with vertebroplasty...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Pain and {{kyphosis}} {{caused by}} osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures adversely affect {{quality of life}} and survival. Kyphoplasty involves the inflation of a balloon <b>bone</b> <b>tamp,</b> percutaneously placed in a fractured vertebral body, followed by deposition of bone cement into the resulting cavity. Most previous reports indicate that traditional bilateral kyphoplasty improves patient function and restores height of collapsed vertebral bodies, but limited data about the effects of unilateral kyphoplasty on clinical and radiological outcome are available. Methods: One hundred five patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures who did not respond to medical therapy were treated by unilateral kypho-plasty between January 2004 and December 2006. These patients underwent 105 operations to treat 132 vertebral compres-sion fractures between T 8 and L 5. Sagittal alignment was analyzed from standing radiographs (pre-and post kyphoplasty). Clinical outcomes were determined by comparison of preoperative and postoperative data from patient-reported indexes (pain assessment, pain medication usage and visual analogue pain scale (VAS) score for Back Pain). Radiographs were assessed as to percent vertebral collapse, vertebral height restoration and local kyphosis correction. Results: Mean length of follow-up was 15. 3 months (range 3 - 36 months); improved height 2. 3 and 4. 0 mm in the anterior and medial columns, respectively (p> 0. 05); cobb angle increased 8. 8 °(0 - 29 °) (p< 0. 05), visual analogue pain scale score improved 7 points (p < 0. 05); no adverse medical or procedural complications; 6. 8 % (9 / 132) cement leakage rate.

40|$|Calcaneal {{fractures}} {{are common}} injuries involving the hind foot {{and often a}} source of significant long-term morbidity. Treatment options have changed throughout the ages from periods of preferred nonoperative management to closed reduction with a mallet, and more recently, open reduction and anatomic internal fixation. The current treatment of choice; however, is often debated, as open management of these fractures carries many risks to include wound breakdown and infection. A less invasive form of surgical management through small incisions, while maintaining the ability to obtain joint congruency, anatomic alignment, and restore calcaneal height and width would be ideal. We propose a novel form of fracture reduction using an <b>inflatable</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tamp</b> and percutaneous fracture fixation. Preoperative planning and experienced fluoroscopy is crucial to successful management using this method. Although we achieved successful radiographic outcome in this case, long-term functional outcome of this technique are yet to be published...|$|E
30|$|After {{inflation}} and reduction, a defect of known volume {{was left behind}} that would be filled with graft or graft substitute. The <b>inflatable</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tamp</b> is less invasive than traditional methods, requiring only a 4 - to 5 -mm cortical drill hole and only disrupting the underlying cancellous bone where the inflation occurred. Depressed intra-articular fractures {{can be difficult to}} treat and acceptable reduction limits vary considerably. Current techniques involve elevating any depressed segments with a metal tamp or elevator and filling the resulting void with bone graft or other desired material [6]. These reduction techniques are often imprecise and have associated complications [1, 2, 14]. With significant comminution, anatomic restoration of the articular surface is virtually impossible to achieve, and conventional instruments can easily penetrate into the joint. Fractures of the articular surface are associated with posttraumatic arthritis and articular cartilage death, and therefore, anatomic restoration of joint congruency should be the goal.|$|E
30|$|Intra-articular {{fractures}} with joint congruity loss often carry a {{poor prognosis}} despite proper management [1 – 3]. Treatment complexity rises as {{the energy of}} the injury increases. Attempts to restore articular congruity must be combined with methods that protect soft tissues and preserve vascularity. Current techniques for managing depressed intra-articular fractures are similar regardless of the joint involved. Access to the subchondral bone is gained through a cortical window or other fenestration in the metaphyseal <b>bone.</b> A <b>tamp</b> or elevator is then inserted and used to elevate the depression en bloc. Bone graft or cancellous chips are often used to assist in elevating the fragments. The resulting void must then be filled with bone graft or bone-graft substitute to provide stability to the reduced fragment. These maneuvers may be imprecise and leave behind some degree of residual defect.|$|R
40|$|Recently {{developed}} inflatable nails avoid reaming and interlocking screws in tibial fractures {{and reflect}} a new principle for stabilization of long bone fractures. We {{asked if the}} bending stiffness, rotational rigidity, or play (looseness of rotation) differed between an inflatable versus large-diameter reamed interlocked nails, and whether the maximal torque to failure of the two bone-implant constructs differed. In a cadaveric model, we compared the biomechanical properties with those of an interlocked nail in eight pairs of fractured tibial bones. Bending stiffness, rotational rigidity, play (looseness in rotation), and torsional strength within 20 ° rotation were investigated using a biaxial servohydraulic testing system. For all biomechanical variables, we found a large interindividual variance between the pairs attributable to bone quality (osteoporosis) for both fixation methods. The inflatable nail had a higher bending stiffness, with a mean difference of 58  N/mm, and a lower torsional strength, with a mean difference of 13. 5  Nm, compared with the locked nail. During torsional testing we noted slippage between the <b>inflatable</b> nail and <b>bone.</b> We observed no differences in play or rotational rigidity. Given the lower torsional strength we recommend caution with weightbearing until {{there are signs of}} fracture consolidation...|$|R
40|$|Osteoporosis is a {{systemic}} disease {{and results in}} progressive bone mineral loss and concurrent change in bone architecture that leave bone vulnerable to fracture. In one third of patients with acute vertebral fracture, severe pain and limited mobility persist despite appropriate nonoperative management. Vertebroplasty is a minimally invasive method that involved the percutaneous injection of cement into a collapsed vertebral body to stabilize the fractured vertebra. The indication of this technique is a painfull fracture after 8 weeks of conservative treatment. Contraindications include coagulopathy, absence of facilities to perform emergency decompressive surgery, a vertebral collapse greater than 65 % and a fracture of the vertebra posterior wall. The procedure results in quick, effective pain relief and complications as epidural leakage or thermal necrosis by cement extravasation are rare. Vertebroplasty does not expand the collapsed vertebra. Kyphoplasty is a modification of this first technique and offers potential advantages as lower risk of cement extravasation and better restoration of the vertebral body height. A cannula is introduced into the vertebral body via a transpedicular approach like for the vertebroplasty technique but it is followed by insertion of an <b>inflatable</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tamp,</b> which when deployed reduces partially the compression fracture. This then creates a cavity {{to be filled with}} bone cement. Considering the higher rates of morbidity or mortality that is associated with osteoporotic fractures, early mobilization in these patients is of prime importance and can be achieved by using each of this two techniques with a relative low complication rate.

30|$|Each tibial plateau was {{fractured}} on {{both the}} medial and lateral sides. For comparison, all tibias underwent reduction of either the medial or lateral plateau with the balloon, and a conventional tamp was used on the contralateral side. For the conventional method, a small cortical window was made and a metal tamp was used to manually elevate the depression. With the balloon method, a working cannula was inserted parallel to the joint line in the metaphyseal bone. A trocar was passed to {{the midpoint of the}} tibia and withdrawn, leaving a path for balloon passage. The balloon was then inserted through the cannula and inflated, subsequently elevating the fracture. Ballon used was the Kyphon/Medtronic, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA. This device is known as the <b>Inflatable</b> <b>Bone</b> <b>Tamp</b> (IBT). The IBT is designed to compress cancellous bone and/or move cortical bone as it inflates. It comprises three biocompatible parts: a proximal luer fitting, a central catheter, and a distal inflatable tip with radiopaque markers. Balloon inflation is achieved using an external inflation syringe filled with radiopaque dye. Fine-cut micro-computed tomography (CT) scans were performed on all intact specimens, following fracture, and again after being reduced. CT data ere used to quantify the fracture volume and displacement and the amount of restored normal anatomy. Data were used to judge restoration efficacy of the normal anatomy and to compare balloon efficacy to conventional methods. The same technique was used to create die-punch fractures of the distal radius. The height of the weight drop was altered to create different degrees of depression for comparison. Only the balloon technique was used to reduce distal radius fractures. The same CT scan protocol was used on all distal radius fractures to evaluate reduction efficacy.|$|E
40|$|Study Design. Controlled {{in vitro}} study. Objective. To compare two kyphoplasty {{techniques}} in cadaveric fractured vertebrae: an experimental vertebral jack tool (VJT) and an <b>inflatable</b> <b>bone</b> <b>tamp</b> (IBT). Summary of Background Data. A previous biomechanical study showed restored strength and stiffness after height restoration in cadaveric-fractured osteoporotic vertebrae {{using a new}} device for reduction of osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Methods. Anterior wedge fractures (AO type A 1. 2) were created in 8 (4 lumbar, 4 thoracic) vertebrae by displacement eccentric external forces. In all vertebrae the amount of height reduction was 35 %. After compression, 4 vertebrae were restored in height using the VJT procedure. Four vertebrae were restored in height using the IBT procedure. Posttreatment strength and stiffness of the vertebrae were determined by a compression test identical to the pretreatment compression protocol. Results. In the VJT group the postrestoration strength was 81 % +/- 13 % of the original strength and in the IBT group it was 96 % +/- 32 %. The postrestoration stiffness in the VJT group was 61 % +/- 42 % of the original stiffness and in the IBT group 76 % +/- 62 % of the original stiffness. The vertebrae in the VJT group were restored to 101 % +/- 2 % of their original height whereas this was 104 % +/- 14 % in the IBT group. In this study, no cases of cement leakage were found. No cases of damaging of the end plates, new fractures or perforations were seen in both groups. The mean amount of cement inserted for the VJT group was 3. 6 +/- 0. 9 cm(3) and for the IBT group 5. 9 +/- 0. 8 cm(3). Conclusion. Both kyphoplasty procedures were able to restore height in this in vitro study, while strength and stiffness were partially restored, with no significant differences. In this study on average significant less cement {{was used in the}} VJT procedure. No complications were noted in both groups. This new end plate-to-end plate laminar augmentation technique may be of clinical advantage...|$|E
