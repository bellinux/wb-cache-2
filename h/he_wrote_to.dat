5|$|In 1925 Ferens {{made his}} largest single donation. <b>He</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> the Lord Mayor of Kingston upon Hull to inform {{him that he}} {{intended}} to donate £250,000 towards the foundation of a university college in the city.|$|E

5|$|A brewer by trade, Lassell {{began making}} mirrors for his amateur {{telescope}} in 1820. When John Herschel received news of Neptune's discovery, <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> Lassell suggesting he search for possible moons. Lassell did so and discovered Triton eight days later. Lassell also {{claimed to have}} discovered rings. Although Neptune was later confirmed to have rings, they are so faint and dark that {{it is doubtful that}} he actually saw them.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Charles tried to release {{himself from the}} oath he swore to protect the Muslims. <b>He</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> Pope Clement VII in 1523 and again in 1524 for this dispensation. Clement {{initially}} resisted the request, but issued in May 1524 a papal brief releasing Charles from the oath and absolving him from all perjuries that might arise from breaking it. The Pope also authorized the Inquisition to suppress oppositions to the upcoming conversions.|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>writes</b> <b>to</b> Tiro {{telling him}} {{that he has not}} the {{slightest}} intention of quarrelling with his old friend Antony, and will <b>write</b> <b>to</b> Antony, but not till he shall have seen him, Tiro; showing on what terms of friendship he stands with his former slave, for Tiro had by this time been manumitted.[186] <b>He</b> <b>writes</b> <b>to</b> Tiro quite as <b>he</b> might have <b>written</b> <b>to</b> a younger Atticus, and speaks to him of Atticus with all the familiarity of confirmed friendship. There must have been something very sweet {{in the nature of the}} intercourse which bound such a man as Cicero to such another as Tiro.|$|R
60|$|Not to let {{the silence}} last too long I asked Mr. Burns if <b>he</b> had <b>written</b> <b>to</b> his captain's wife. He shook his head. <b>He</b> had <b>written</b> <b>to</b> nobody.|$|R
5|$|Back at {{the bowling}} alley, Homer {{and his friends}} enter the bowling league competition, calling {{themselves}} the Pin Pals. They beat three teams before moving up into second place in their league. Meanwhile, Burns recovers from his stupor and discovers the check <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> Homer. Burns wants to join the team (replacing Otto in the team), but since Burns is a horrible bowler, the team is convinced they will lose the championship.|$|E
5|$|Disraeli {{refused to}} cast {{blame for the}} defeat, which he {{understood}} {{was likely to be}} final for him. <b>He</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> Lady Bradford that it was just as much work to end a government as to form one, without any of the fun. Queen Victoria was bitter at his departure as Prime Minister. Among the honours he arranged before resigning as Prime Minister on 21 April 1880 was one for his private secretary, Montagu Corry, who became Baron Rowton.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the plans}} {{did not fully}} work as intended. The native populations that joined Arenales could not resist the royalist counter-attacks, and the slaves did not join the army in the {{expected}} numbers. The Argentine provinces could not send the supporting army that San Martín had requested earlier, and the Army of the North no longer existed. As a result, <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> Simón Bolívar, trying to coordinate actions with him.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the tablet}} is {{addressed}} {{to all the}} rulers of the world, <b>he</b> <b>writes</b> <b>to</b> some specific groups as well. <b>To</b> the Christians <b>he</b> <b>writes</b> that <b>he</b> is the return of Jesus Christ: ...|$|R

5|$|Monteverdi {{recorded}} {{no apparent}} {{interest in the}} performance of Andromeda after the 1620 Carnival; the long letter that <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> Striggio on 13 March 1620 makes no reference to the event and is chiefly concerned with financial matters. The letter implies that the Gonzaga court was trying to persuade Monteverdi to return to Mantua; in courtly language Monteverdi evades the issue, while comparing the relative generosity of his Venetian employers with the parsimony of the Gonzaga court.|$|E
5|$|Sorabji was homosexual, and in {{the early}} 1920s he {{consulted}} Havelock Ellis, a British psychologist and writer on sexual psychology, about it. Ellis held progressive views on the subject, and Sorabji expressed high admiration for him, dedicating his Piano Concerto No. 7, Simorg-Anka (1924), to him as an expression of gratitude. Although Sorabji experienced racial harassment in his youth, his homosexuality caused him greater trouble; <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> Holliday that he had once been blackmailed over it.|$|E
5|$|All these {{attempts}} {{to mount a}} combined offensive between the Franks and Mongols were too little and too late. In May 1291, the city of Acre was conquered by the Egyptian Mamluks in the Siege of Acre. When Pope Nicholas IV learned of this, <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> Arghun, again asking him to be baptized and {{to fight against the}} Mamluks. But Arghun had died on , and Pope Nicholas died as well in March 1292, putting an end to their efforts towards combined action.|$|E
5|$|Still later 624: {{the pope}} hears from Eadbald of his conversion, and also hears of Mellitus's death. <b>He</b> <b>writes</b> <b>to</b> Justus {{to send him}} the pallium.|$|R

5|$|Although {{no longer}} {{employed}} by the New Zealand Company, Heaphy, emboldened {{by the success of}} his report and the public reception to his paintings, sought further opportunities for similar work. From London, <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> the company secretary seeking support for exploration of the area inland of Nelson. The response was unenthusiastic, the company was concentrating on developing its settlements, rather than undertaking in further exploration of the country. Despite this, Heaphy returned to New Zealand and arrived in Nelson on 22 December 1842.|$|E
5|$|Amir's {{mother died}} in 1931, and his father the year after, meaning that his {{education}} {{could no longer be}} funded. After his AMS studies concluded, he wanted to continue to study at a law school in Batavia. As such, <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> his brother, Jakfar, who arranged for the remainder of his studies to be paid for by the Sultan. In 1932 Amir was able to return to Batavia and begin his legal studies, taking up a part-time job as a teacher. At first, his relationship with Sundari was continued through letters, though she soon continued her studies in Lembang, a city much closer than Surakarta; this allowed the two to meet furtively– when Sundari's parents had discovered their relationship, Amir and Sundari had been forbidden from meeting.|$|E
5|$|Cancellor {{was found}} dead in his bedroom on the morning of 22 April. His body was covered, with long {{stockings}} over his legs and kidskin gloves on his hands. The only visible part of the body was his face. A medical man of Hopley's acquaintance named Roberts pronounced that the boy had died of natural causes. When questioned, Hopley suggested that Cancellor died of heart disease and argued that he should be buried immediately. <b>He</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> the boy's father requesting the body's immediate removal and interment. After viewing his son's dressed body, Cancellor's father accepted Roberts' assertion for cause of death and agreed to the burial.|$|E

5|$|For {{his next}} major action, Gandhi {{decided on a}} raid of the Dharasana Salt Works in Gujarat, 25 miles south of Dandi. <b>He</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> Lord Irwin, again telling him of his plans. Around midnight of 4 May, as Gandhi was {{sleeping}} on a cot in a mango grove, the District Magistrate of Surat drove up with two Indian officers and thirty heavily armed constables. He was arrested under an 1827 regulation calling for the jailing of people engaged in unlawful activities, and held without trial near Poona (now Pune).|$|E
5|$|He {{was thankful}} to be posted to the No. 1 School of Aerial Fighting at Ayr in Scotland, where he flew the {{excellent}} performing Sopwith Snipe. It was in Scotland {{that he learned}} {{of the death of}} his brother, apparently shot down by the German ace Hans Wolff on 19 March. <b>He</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> his brother's commanding officer, Sholto Douglas asking for any news but understanding the Major's attention was now fixed on the German Spring Offensive. His death depressed McCudden greatly.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, Albert Einstein {{published}} his paper On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies about special relativity. Born was intrigued, and began researching the subject. He was devastated {{to discover that}} Minkowski was also researching special relativity along the same lines, but when <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>to</b> Minkowski about his results, Minkowski asked {{him to return to}} Göttingen and do his habilitation there. Born accepted. Toeplitz helped Born brush up on his matrix algebra so he could work with the four-dimensional Minkowski space matrices used in the latter's project to reconcile relativity with electrodynamics. Born and Minkowski got along well, and their work made good progress, but Minkowski died suddenly of appendicitis on 12 January 1909. The mathematics students had Born speak on their behalf at the funeral.|$|E
