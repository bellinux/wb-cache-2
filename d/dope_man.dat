5000|$|Born in Atlanta, Carter {{played as}} a {{freshman}} on the varsity team of Alonzo A. Crim High School in Atlanta. However, after his freshman year, Carter quit high school. After leaving school, Carter spent his teenage years playing basketball for money in Atlanta. The Rocky Mountain News quoted Carter stating: [...] "The <b>dope</b> <b>man</b> would put up the money, and we would play. We used {{to play for the}} drug dealers. That's how we were going to make our money. We didn't sell the drugs ... (I used the money) to buy shoes and food. That was the only way we could eat." [...] During his teenage years, Carter's mother was on drugs, and all seven of his uncles were at one point in prison.|$|E
5000|$|During the Rolling Stone interview, {{he spoke}} about if the first two singles were {{representative}} of {{the direction of the}} album, saying: [...] "I feel like it's representative of the club side of the album but I'm really trying to give people all sides of me. So of course there's the side of me that likes going to the strip club and likes partying but there's also the other side of me that's a lot more transcendental and a lot more cerebral that's on the album as well." [...] He also spoke about the most cerebral song on the album, saying: [...] "I got a song called [...] "Coast Line." [...] It's not out yet, and I can't really say too much on it yet, but it's a very abstract song. I don't want to spoil anything for the first time listeners, but that's the one. I mean, I haven't really figured out all the songs {{that are going to be}} on the album, but that one definitely will be going on there." [...] He also revealed that American singer Chris Brown would be featured on the album, saying: [...] "I got Chris Brown on there. He's <b>dope,</b> <b>man.</b> We were at the studio and we always work in a lot of the same studios so he just stuck his head in the studio one day and I was like, [...] "Yo, man, I got some shit that I need to play you." [...] So he played me one of his records for his album and we both got on each other's album." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not sure}} that dad and Barclay would have had Webster made mail carrier if they had {{expected}} this," [...] he whispered. [...] "There's no doubt the <b>dope</b> <b>men</b> are growing bolder." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If the <b>dope</b> <b>men</b> {{leave us}} alone {{for the next three}} weeks we're not likely to be troubled with them afterward," [...] he said. [...] "Barclay expects very shortly to be ready for what he calls his coup." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've hit it," [...] said Harry, {{whose face}} grew stern. [...] "If they come along there'll be trouble, but we'll {{make some of}} it. I don't feel kind to the <b>dope</b> <b>men</b> after that sight in the schooner's cabin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} was Webster who fired first," [...] said Harry in a low, tense voice. [...] "If I'm wrong, {{it means that the}} <b>dope</b> <b>men</b> have got in between us and the house, but that isn't likely. Dad would have heard them and made a move if they'd tried it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Harry {{with the}} same {{strained}} laugh, [...] "dad knows too much for that. Those logs are thick, they won't light easy, and it's only a little pile of small stuff that's burning. Dad has no use for standing out where those fellows can see him unless it's necessary. In the meanwhile the <b>dope</b> <b>men</b> don't {{know where he is}} and that's going to worry them." ...|$|R
60|$|They set {{out soon}} {{afterward}} and Frank, for one, was glad of the walk. He had been cramped {{on board the}} sloop, and {{the excitement of the}} last few days had told on him. He was nervously restless and felt that it would be useless to lie down until he was physically worn out. When he mentioned it to Harry the latter confessed to a similar sensation, and added that they had not yet finished with the <b>dope</b> <b>men.</b>|$|R
60|$|Frank could {{understand}} this. It seemed {{very likely that}} the small fire would burn out before the logs caught, {{and it was clear}} that the men who had made it could not run back into the light to throw on more brushwood without incurring the hazard of being shot. On the other hand, Mr. Oliver would have to face the same peril if he approached to put it out. From this it seemed very probable that both he and the <b>dope</b> <b>men</b> would wait to see what the result would be.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{he said at}} length, [...] "I can't {{figure out}} the thing, and unless some of the <b>dope</b> <b>men</b> explain it I don't think we're likely to be much wiser. As Jake said, {{it looks as if}} they had jibed her by accident, which would {{probably}} rip out the mainmast, but, although it's easy to bring the mainboom over on a fore-and-aft rigged craft, it's mighty seldom that a capable sailor does it. Then, as there's water in her, they must have bumped her on a reef, though she could only have struck once or twice before she drove over it. That's as far as I can get, and the first thing is to find out what water there is below. It's fortunate you have a lantern." ...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the vast}} amount of {{literature}} available on doping in sports, {{little is known about}} how the general public actually thinks about doping. It is even more unclear how public opinion on doping differs within the population. Our questionnaire-based study for Flanders (Belgium), with a focus on doping in cycling, shows a strong disapproval of doping use by all respondents. There are statistically significant differences, though, among the population groups. Cycling fans tend to be less negative towards doping in cycling than non-cycling fans. Cycling fans also express a clear feeling of their sport being treated unfairly compared to other sports. Furthermore we observe some clear gender-based and age-based differences in opinion: women and older people are much more opposed to <b>doping</b> than <b>men</b> and younger people. nrpages: 23 status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|In {{the fourth}} timeline, Jeff rolls a six and Britta has to go. Annie tends to Jeff in the {{bathroom}} since Britta isn't using it. Jeff expresses his concern for Annie, but {{just as they are}} about to kiss, they are interrupted by Troy screaming. Pierce is terrorizing him with the troll, and reveals that he is upset that Troy has moved out from his mansion. Britta returns with the pizza <b>man,</b> <b>doped,</b> and announces they are now engaged.|$|R
2500|$|Though {{journalist}} Khushwant Singh believed {{himself to}} be on Bhindranwale's hit list, he allowed that the Sikh preacher-become-activist genuinely made no distinction between higher and lower castes, {{and that he had}} restored thousands of drunken or <b>doped</b> Sikh <b>men,</b> inured to pornographic films, to their families, and that Operation Blue Star had given the movement for Khalistan its first martyr in Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale. In 2003, at a function arranged by the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, at Akal Takhat Amritsar under the vision of president SGPC Prof. Kirpal Singh Badungar and Singh Sahib Giani Joginder Singh Vedanti, former jathedar of the Akal Takht made a formal declaration that Bhindranwale was a [...] "martyr" [...] and awarded his son, Ishar Singh, a robe of honour. Harbans Singh's The Encyclopedia of Sikhism describes Bhindranwale as [...] "a phenomenal figure of modern Sikhism".|$|R
