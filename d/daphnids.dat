Bythotrephes longimanus, a predacious zooplankter, has invaded > 130 inland lakes in North America, yet {{few studies have}} documented the long-term phenology and impact of an invasion. This study used Bythotrephes spines and Daphnia ephippia in 210 Pb-dated sediment cores from four sites in Island Lake Reservoir (Minnesota, United States) to document the establishment and growth of the Bythotrephes population and to examine corresponding changes in <b>daphnid</b> species composition and density during a 40 -year period spanning the invasion. Based on sediment evidence, Bythotrephes invaded the reservoir in 1982. 2, or about 8 years prior to what was its first detection {{in the water column}} in 1990. If accurate, this makes Island Lake Reservoir the first documented inland lake invaded in North America. Year to year population density of Bythotrephes followed a logistic growth model, and generally took about 10 years to reach annual carrying capacity. A notable impact of Bythotrephes on the <b>daphnid</b> community occurred within the first few years but did not intensify with increased Bythotrephes density over time. <b>Daphnid</b> species composition shifted in the western basin toward D. mendotae dominance, but did not shift in the eastern basin. The reservoir maintained a population of its largest-bodied <b>daphnid,</b> D. pulex, despite Bythotrephes presence. Coincident with Bythotrephes invasion, mean <b>daphnid</b> ephippium size decreased both within species and for the whole 3 -species <b>daphnid</b> assemblage. This research suggests that lakes could harbor Bythotrephes for years before its first detection in the water column, that annual population build-up of Bythotrephes may require years before reaching peak annual densities, that the impact of Bythotrephes on food webs occurs relatively quickly, and that long-term impacts of Bythotrephes in a reservoir may be less severe than in natural lake ecosystems...|$|R

50|$|Microtox was {{developed}} by Azur Environmental (formerly Microbics Corporation) in 1979 as a cost effective alternative to toxicity tests available at the time. Prior to Microtox, the majority of toxicity tests available for water specifically focused on fish and <b>daphnids.</b> Since its inception, Microtox has become a standard method for testing the toxicity of water {{as well as other}} substrates such as soils and sediments. In recent years the Microtox technology and name have undergone various different ownerships. In 2011, Microtox and related technologies was acquired by Modern Water from Strategic Diagnostics Incorporated (SDIX) for approximately $4.5 million. Prior to SDIX, Microtox was owned by its original developers Azur Environmental. Microtox utilizes a bioluminescent bacteria (Allivibrio fischeri) to determine the toxicity of a particular substance and/or substrate. During cellular metabolism, these bacteria naturally emit light as a part of cellular respiration, which can be measured as luminescence. When exposed to toxic substances, a decrease in luminescence can be observed and percent change in luminescence can be directly correlated to toxicity. Allivibrio fischeri were specifically chosen, as these bacteria could be preserved by freeze-drying to increase shelf life and use. Both solid phase (soils and sediment) and aqueous acute toxicity testing (described below) can be conducted using this technology.|$|E

Two dominant orientation positions were observed: a negative orientation, with the head directed away from the illuminated area, and a positive orientation, with the head directed towards the illuminated area. I studied four clones and these appeared to orient in quite different ways. In three clones, chemicals associated with predatory fish changed the orientation of the body to a more negative one. Contrast orientation of freely swimming <b>daphnids</b> was studied in order to investigate if the contrast orientation influenced the body position of freely moving <b>daphnids</b> correspondingly.

40|$|Abstract The {{timing of}} various {{plankton}} successional events in Lake Constance was tightly coupled to a large-scale meteorological phenomenon, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). A causal chain of meteorological, hydrological, and ecological processes connected the NAO {{as well as}} winter and early spring meteorological conditions to planktonic events in summer leading to a remarkable memory of climatic effects lasting over al-most half a year. The response of Daphnia to meteoro-logical forcing was most probably a direct effect of al-tered water temperatures on <b>daphnid</b> growth and was not mediated by changes in phytoplankton concentrations. High spring water temperatures during “high-NAO years ” enabled high population growth rates, resulting in a high <b>daphnid</b> biomass as early as May. Hence, a critical Daphnia biomass to suppress phytoplankton was reached earlier in high-NAO years yielding an early and longer-lasting clear-water phase. Finally, an earlier summer de-cline of Daphnia produced in a negative relationship be-tween Daphnia biomass in July and the NAO. Meteoro-logical forcing of the seasonal plankton dynamics in Lake Constance included simple temporal shifts of pro-cesses and successional events, but also complex chang-es in {{the relative importance of}} different mechanisms. Since Daphnia {{plays an important role in}} plankton suc-cession, a thorough understanding of the regulation of its population dynamics provides the key for predictions of the response of freshwater planktonic food webs to glob-al climate change...|$|R

40|$|Health, {{distribution}} and life-history of aquatic crustaceans strongly depend on water hardness. However hardness is commonly correlated with alkalinity, which highlights {{the need to}} assess the joint effects of both hardness and alkalinity. This study aims {{to test the hypothesis}} that water hardness and alkalinity affect the life-history parameters (growth, reproduction and population growth rate) of D. longispina. Following this, life table experiments were carried out in order to study the effects of high levels versus low levels of water hardness and alkalinity. Low levels of hardness and alkalinity caused a significant reduction in the growth of <b>daphnids</b> after a 7 -days period, which augmented during the 21 -day-test period reaching a 14. 5 % reduction compared to high hardness and alkalinity. Allied to the reduced growth, <b>daphnids</b> reared at low hardness and alkalinity showed delayed reproduction, increased body length at first reproduction, reduced fertility at first brood and, consequently, a 36. 6 % reduction in total fertility, compared to <b>daphnids</b> reared at high hardness and alkalinity. Accordingly, <b>daphnids</b> with the same size produced smaller broods at low hardness and alkalinity, reflecting a direct effect of water chemistry on <b>daphnids</b> reproduction. The impaired growth and reproduction at low hardness and alkalinity levels was likely a consequence of increased maintenance costs, and was not related to changes in the feeding activity. Population growth rate of <b>daphnids</b> reared at low hardness and alkalinity was 13. 4 % lower than that of <b>daphnids</b> reared at high hardness and alkalinity. Thus, despite D. longispina can survive at low hardness and alkalinity, their life-history parameters are significantly affected.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the relative importance}} of a behavioural defence (refuge use through diel vertical migration) and a life history change (a reduced size at first reproduction) that are used by <b>daphnids</b> to decrease the risk of predation by visually hunting fish. We used an individual based model of a Daphnia population in a stratified lake to quantify the effects of these inducible defences on Daphnia predation-mortality and the resulting Daphnia population dynamics. Our analysis shows that diel vertical migration (DVM) confers a much stronger protection against fish predation than a reduced size at first reproduction (SFR). DVM allows <b>daphnids</b> to withstand a higher predation pressure in the epilimnion and it decelerates a Daphnia population decline more strongly than a reduced SFR. DVM effectively reduces the (P/B) flow of carbon from <b>daphnids</b> to fish. Many theoretical studies have only considered the fitness benefits of DVM above ‘staying up’ in the epilimnion of a lake. Our results suggest that ‘staying down’ in the hypolimnion would confer an even stronger fitness benefit to Daphnia than DVM at times of peak predation risk. <b>Daphnids</b> that remain in the hypolimnion avoid the predation suffered by migrating <b>daphnids</b> around dusk and dawn.

The water flea, Daphnia magna, is an OECD test species and is utilised internationally for toxicity testing. However, no metabolomics studies of this species have been reported. Here we optimised and evaluated the effectiveness of FT-ICR mass spectrometry metabolomics for toxicity testing in D. magna.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the population dynamics and production ecology of Daphnia magna Strauss, D. pulicaria Forbes and D. hyalina Leydig from a riverine impoundment, Wraysbury Reservoir, in the lower Thames Valley, U. K. The three species co-exist throughout the year and are the main contributors to the zooplanktonic biomass of the reservoir. Weekly samples taken from several stations in the reservoir and over seventeen months during 1985 and 1986 provide data on the numerical densities, size structure and fecundities of the three populations and permit the analysis of their population dynamics. These data, together with regularly determined length-carbon weight relationships within the field populations, enable estimates to be made of population biomasses. Periods of sexual reproduction were identified from the appearance of males and ephippial females and some attempt was made to quantify the benthic stock of viable ephippia in the reservoir. The appearance of 'bites' on the carapaces of some individuals indicated the presence of a predator whose identity has not yet been discovered. Some attempts were made to assess the quantity of food available to the <b>daphnid</b> populations and to identify the periods of food limitation. Food level was estimated by the direct determination of the less than 50 micron fraction of the chlorophyll a biomass, converted to units of Carbon from chlorophyll a : carbon ratio derived from field data. Periods of food limitation were indicated {{by the size of the}} primiparous female, the Carbon weight of a standard female and the relationship between fecundity and size of female for each <b>daphnid</b> species. It was possible to compare these field data with the results of Rocha (1983) from her long-term laboratory life cycle studies on the same species from Wraysbury Reservoir which were conducted under defined food and temperature conditions. This comparison permitted the prediction of field food levels, which could be compared with those measured directly. The identification of periods in the year when food was limiting to the <b>daphnid</b> populations provided the possibility of assigning both instar stages and duration of developmenmt to different-sized individuals, both based upon the experimental study of Rocha (1983). Knowing these population parameters, it is possible to make better estimates of the levels of population mortality rates at different times of year and of the secondary production of the three species in Wraysbury Reservoir. The seasonal time course of the population dynamics and production of the three species is considered in relation to food limitations, inter-specific competition and possible predation. <p...|$|R

The {{aim was to}} establish whether <b>daphnids</b> selected the filaments in a certain length range or ingested them indiscriminately regardless of size. We also investigated the effect of Daphnia body size on filament size selection. Both large-sized cladocerans, i. e. Daphnia spp., and the filamentous alga Ulothrix sp. were abundant in spring period (February–May 2004). We simultaneously investigated and {{compared the}} length distributions of Ulothrix in the lake and the guts of <b>daphnids</b> that varied in size. The maximum lengths of Ulothrix filaments ingested by each size class of <b>daphnids</b> varying in length from 0. 75 to 2. 90 mm ranged from 380 and 1030 µm; a range that is quite similar to the size ranges of filaments found in the lake. Also the size frequency of the filaments in Daphnia guts versus those in the lake did not differ significantly. The number of filaments in the guts of individual <b>daphnids</b> ranged from 0 to 668. Our results demonstrated that <b>daphnids</b> (> 0. 75 mm) did not feed selectivity on a certain length range of filaments but rather do so in proportion to their availability in the lake.

40|$|The {{assumption}} that macrophytes can provide zooplankton a daytime refuge against fish predation {{is central to}} the diel horizontal migration hypothesis. However, previous observations and experiments have shown that large-bodied zooplankton avoid macrophytes. To directly test these contrasting roles of macrophytes, we measured the reaction of Daphnia pulex to macrophytes (Elodea canadensis or plastic) in the presence and absence of chemical cues from two commonly occurring European fishes, roach (Rutilus rutilus) and perch (Perca fluvialitis). In the same series of laboratory experiments, we then tested the ability of different densities of E. canadensis and plastic macrophytes to reduce predation by roach or perch. In the absence of fish, only 27 % of <b>daphnids</b> occurred in the macrophytes. However, 70 – 80 % of <b>daphnids</b> occurred in the macrophytes when either roach or perch occurred. In addition, significantly more <b>daphnids</b> occurred in plastic versus real macrophytes, indicating that some chemically mediated avoidance of real macrophytes by Daphnia occurred. In the presence of fish chemical cues from either roach or perch, the differences between real and plastic macrophytes quickly disappeared as <b>daphnids</b> moved into macrophytes. However, this behavior decreased mortality only from roach predation, because perch spent signifi-cantly more time than roach foraging among macrophytes. Thus, although <b>daphnids</b> sought macrophyte refuge in the presence of both fishes, the effectiveness of the refuge depended on macrophyte density and predator identity...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{combining}} a proportional-hazards survival time {{model with a}} bioassay model where the log-hazard function is modelled as a linear or smoothing spline function of log-concentration combined with a smoothing spline function of time is described. The combined model is fitted to mortality numbers, resulting from survival times that are grouped due to {{a common set of}} observation times, using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs). The GAM fits mortalities as conditional binomials using an approximation to the log of the integral of the hazard function and is implemented using freely-available, general software for fitting GAMs. Extensions of the GAM are described to allow random effects to be fitted and to allow for time-varying concentrations by replacing time with a calibrated cumulative exposure variable with calibration parameter estimated using profile likelihood. The models are demonstrated using data from a studies of a marine and a, previously published, freshwater taxa. The marine study involved two replicate bioassays of the effect of zinc exposure on survival of an Antarctic amphipod, Orchomenella pinguides. The other example modelled survival of the <b>daphnid,</b> Daphnia magna, exposed to potassium dichromate and was fitted by both the GAM and the process-based DEBtox model. The GAM fitted with a cubic regression spline in time gave a 61 % improvement in fit to the <b>daphnid</b> data compared to DEBtox due to a non-monotonic hazard function. A simulation study using each of these hazard functions as operating models demonstrated that the GAM is overall more accurate in recovering lethal concentration values across the range of forms of the underlying hazard function compared to DEBtox and standard multiple endpoint probit analyses...|$|R

The organisms specified for testing were larval fathead minnows, Pimephales promelas, and the <b>daphnid,</b> Ceriodaphnia dubia. Surface water samples were collected by TVA Field engineering personnel from Clinch River Mile 19. 0 and Mile 22. 0 on July 21, 23, and 26. Samples were split and provided to the CR-ERP and TVA toxicology laboratories for testing. Exposure of test organisms to these samples resulted in no toxicity (survival, growth, or reproduction) to either species in testing conducted by TVA.

40|$|The {{effects of}} microcystins on Daphnia galeata, a typical filter-feeding grazer in {{eutrophic}} lakes, were investigated. To do this, the microcystin-producing wild-type strain Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806 was {{compared with a}} mcy− PCC 7806 mutant, which could not synthesize any variant of microcystin due to mutation of a microcystin synthetase gene. The wild-type strain {{was found to be}} poisonous to D. galeata, whereas the mcy− mutant did not have any lethal effect on the animals. Both variants of PCC 7806 were able to reduce the Daphnia ingestion rate. Our results suggest that microcystins are the most likely cause of the <b>daphnid</b> poisoning observed when wild-type strain PCC 7806 is fed to the animals, but these toxins are not responsible for inhibition of the ingestion process...|$|R
