25|$|After {{mediating}} {{between the}} United States Navy and the Puerto Rican government over the involuntary transfer {{of part of}} the islands of Vieques and Culebra to naval authorities, Leahy resigned in March 1949, though as an officer with five-star rank, he technically remained on active service. The following year, he published his war memoirs, <b>I</b> <b>Was</b> <b>There.</b>|$|E
25|$|His next album, We All Had Doctors' Papers, {{was another}} live album, {{recorded}} {{this time at}} Pontarddulais Rugby Club. This was released in late 1975 and, unexpectedly, it reached the #1 position on the UK Albums Chart for the week ending 15 November. This recording has {{the distinction of being}} the only comedy album to ever top the UK Albums Chart. Boyce released several albums over the next few years, receiving further gold discs for The Incredible Plan in 1976, and I Know 'Cos <b>I</b> <b>Was</b> <b>There</b> in 1978.|$|E
25|$|As Boyce's {{popularity}} became established throughout Wales and the United Kingdom, {{he became}} involved in many side projects, including three books, several television series and televised concerts, and three multi-part television specials produced by Opix Films. His spoken and sung poetry was first collected in Max Boyce: His Songs and Poems in 1976, with an introduction by Barry John. The comic illustrations that accompany the poems were drawn by his friend Gren Jones of the South Wales Echo (who had also illustrated the cover of We All Had Doctors' Papers). This publication was followed up with a similar collection, <b>I</b> <b>Was</b> <b>There!,</b> in 1980.|$|E

500|$|His own {{reaction}} was positive. [...] "Doctor Ox was aurally alluring, with {{a row of}} lyrical ideas flowering from a Straussian seed-bed and just enough drama to justify the stage business – but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> to enjoy, not review." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{just wanted}} to create and do {{something}} different and branch out. At {{the heart of it}} I know it's still Evanescence and it's still me, but structurally it's a lot more fun. We went {{a lot of different ways}} with it instead of constantly sticking to the same structure and the same pop formula. I think it's more mature and more brave all around; it's like the instruments actually go together, the piano and guitar and vocals, since they're written together -- they intertwine. It's definitely even more personal. At least for me, because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> it sounds more fun because I was having so much more fun." ...|$|E
500|$|... "So I {{head out}} there and he plays me the track and it sounds exactly like how {{you want it to}} sound: forward moving, interesting, light-hearted, heavy-hearted, fucking {{incredible}} sounding jam. It was kind of bare so I added some choir-sounding stuff and then thicked out the samples with my voice. That whole first week <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> we worked on the 'Woods' song, which is called 'Lost in the World'. We were just eating breakfast and listening to the song on the speakers and he's like, 'Fuck, {{this is going to be}} the festival closer.' I was like, 'Yeah, cool.' It kind of freaked me out." ...|$|E

500|$|Dylan first {{performed}} [...] "Visions of Johanna" [...] {{in public}} on December 4, 1965, at the Berkeley Community Theatre. Present at this concert was Joan Baez, who believed the lyrics referred to her. She said, [...] "He'd just written 'Visions of Johanna', which sounded very suspicious to me...he'd never performed it before and Neuwirth told him <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> {{that night and}} he performed it." [...] Heylin suggests that if Dylan performed it for anyone that night it was Allen Ginsberg, who was also present. Heylin argues Dylan considered Ginsberg {{to be an important}} influence on his songwriting at this juncture, and was keen to showcase the song for the Beat poet.|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} for The Rocketeer {{lasted from}} September 19, 1990 to January 22, 1991. Filming at the Griffith Observatory {{took place in}} November 1990. The film ended up going 50 days over schedule due to weather and mechanical problems. Rocketeer creator Dave Stevens allied himself with director Joe Johnston and production manager Ian Bryce {{in an effort to}} be as heavily involved in the production process as possible and to try and secure as much artistic control as he could from Disney. Disney, in particular, was not enthusiastic with Stevens' involvement. [...] "I was on the set day and night", Stevens reflected, [...] "from pre-production till post-production! And initially, I had to fight to prove that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> {{for the benefit of the}} film, and not for my own ego." ...|$|E
500|$|Barbauld commented to {{her husband}} in 1773: [...] "For {{the early part of}} my life I {{converse}}d little with my own Sex. In the Village where <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> <b>there</b> was none to converse with." [...] Barbauld was surrounded by boys as a child and adopted their high spirits. Her mother attempted to subdue these, which would have been viewed as unseemly in a woman; according to Lucy Aikin's memoir, what resulted was [...] "a double portion of bashfulness and maidenly reserve" [...] in Barbauld's character. Barbauld was never quite comfortable with her identity as a woman and always believed that she {{failed to live up to}} the ideal of womanhood; much of her writing would center around issues central to women and her [...] "outsider" [...] perspective allowed her to question many of the traditional assumptions about femininity during the eighteenth century.|$|E

6000|$|... "Of {{course we}} will," [...] she answered. [...] "My aunt goes nowhere, but the Duchess will bring me, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure. Ask her when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>there,</b> {{and we can}} agree about the day." ...|$|R

500|$|Saran was {{the first}} actress, and the third celebrity after Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan to deliver a lecture to {{students}} at the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad (IIM-A) on 12 February 2010. She said that [...] "The Indian media and entertainment industry is the fastest growing sector at present, so considering this IIM Ahmedabad had started a new program CFI– Contemporary Film Industry– A Business Perspective. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> to give a lecture to 2nd year students of CFI and {{did a lot of}} research for the lecture for nearly five days." [...] She held a lecture on the marketing and branding of a film. In 2011, she gave a lecture to students at the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) Madras on the history of films, and films as a medium of cultural exchange.|$|E
500|$|Well, I {{actually}} had the idea, I wrote {{the story about}} what it is actually like to be in the Service, and it does take a lot of physical strength, but now that I've been through it – and even just for the three days <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> [...] a lot of mental strength. We used only Marines, no actors or actresses. We used all of the Marine's equipment and they were so lovely to us, I always have fun even though it's a lot of work. Even though I was sore and exhausted, I was so educated on people in the service, who I've always respected but the stuff they go through, and the kind of loyalty they possess, it's very communal, and community. Not to sound weird, but it seems like the heart of America. Seriously, the heart.|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was shot and {{directed}} by Cliff Watts, who had also shot Beyoncé's Sports Illustrated cover. The video for the song served as the closing clip for the B'Day Anthology Video Album, and was filmed on Super 8 mm film in Miami. Beyoncé discussed the music video with MTV, stating that, [...] " [...] feels like something you shouldn't be seeing, like you found a home video. It's very raw: no retouching, no special effects. That's who I am. You can see my soul." [...] In an interview with Vibe Beyoncé recalled the video, [...] "I didn't have any hair and makeup. [...] just me {{on the beach and}} in the sun, and I brought one bathing suit 'cause <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> for myself. It's very artistic and grimy, and [...] no retouching. It is what it is." ...|$|E

500|$|McCormack {{enrolled}} at Ryerson University School of Theatre in Toronto to further improve his acting. He left Ryerson in 1985, {{several months before}} graduating, [...] to accept a position with the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Ontario, where he spent five seasons performing. [...] "It was all I wanted, to be a classical actor {{for the rest of}} my life, but during the last couple of years <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> I started to realise that it wasn't for me. Perhaps I didn't have to give my Hamlet before I died, that the world might be an OK place without my Hamlet, in fact." [...] McCormack appeared in the productions A Midsummer Night's Dream, Henry V, Murder in the Cathedral and Three Sisters. McCormack later performed with the Manitoba Theatre Centre in a production of Burn This, as well as with Toronto's Royal Alexandra Theatre in Biloxi Blues.|$|E
500|$|Simon left Gracie Films and The Simpsons in 1993. Simon {{commented that}} he [...] "wasn't enjoying it anymore," [...] wished to pursue other projects, and [...] "that any show I've ever worked on, it turns {{me into a}} monster. I go crazy. I hate myself." [...] Before leaving, he {{negotiated}} a deal that saw him receive {{a share of the}} show's profits every year, particularly from home media, and an executive producer credit despite not having worked on the show since 1993. The deal means he made over $10 million a year from The Simpsons; he later told Stanford Magazine that [...] "tens of millions" [...] was a closer figure. Simon commented: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> I thought I was underpaid. I thought I wasn't getting enough credit for it. Now, I think it's completely the opposite. I get too much credit for it. And the money is ridiculous." ...|$|E
500|$|Kyle Busch, who {{finished}} second, said, [...] "He {{was on a}} mission today, that's for sure. When Jeff Gordon has a good car {{and he has the}} opportunity to beat you, he's going to beat you. He's my hero. I've always watched him and what he's been able to accomplish over the years." [...] In the subsequent press conference, pole position winner, Edwards, stated his frustration at his accident, [...] "I’m not exactly sure what happened. I’ll have to talk to Kyle about it. I thought at first he was just frustrated and he turned left to get back in line and he didn’t know <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> but I watched the tape and I think he really did get loose. He hit me hard and I was left with nothing. I got rammed to the infield." [...] Rick Hendrick, the owner of Hendrick Motorsports, expressed his enjoyment of winning the race, stating, [...] "When you're a champion like Jeff Gordon, you know you can still do it, (even) when people overlook you. He's been right there but he hasn't had that edge. I think we're {{going to see a lot}} of momentum out of that team right now." ...|$|E
