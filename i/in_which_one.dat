5|$|According to Israeli {{historian}} Shai Lachman, between 1921 and 1935 al-Qassam often {{cooperated with}} Hajj Amin al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. They were initially on good terms, and al-Qassam's various official appointments required the mufti's prior consent. He suggests their cooperation increased after the 1929 riots, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>one</b> source claims al-Qassam's men were active. The two fell {{out in the}} mid-1930s, perhaps due to al-Qassam's independent line of activism. In 1933, al-Qassam sent an emissary to al-Husseini, requesting the latter's participation in a revolt against the British. At the time, al-Husseini refused, preferring a political solution.|$|E
5|$|Alienation is {{a shooter}} and {{role-playing}} video game developed by Housemarque {{and published by}} Sony Interactive Entertainment. It was released in April 2016 for PlayStation 4.

5|$|Consistent {{condom use}} {{reduces the risk}} of HIV {{transmission}} by approximately 80% over the long term. When condoms are used consistently by a couple <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>one</b> person is infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year. There is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection. Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among African women. By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation.|$|E

5|$|General {{relativity}} {{does not}} place any {{limits on the}} possible dimensions of spacetime. Although the theory is typically formulated in four dimensions, one can write down the same equations for the gravitational field {{in any number of}} dimensions. Supergravity is more restrictive because it places an upper limit on the number of dimensions. In 1978, work by Werner Nahm showed that the maximum spacetime dimension <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>one</b> can formulate a consistent supersymmetric theory is eleven. In the same year, Eugene Cremmer, Bernard Julia, and Joel Scherk of the École Normale Supérieure showed that supergravity not only permits up to eleven dimensions but is in fact most elegant in this maximal number of dimensions.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, {{while working}} for the Balboa Amusement Producing Company, William Jossey wrote the {{screenplay}} for the first feature-length film adaptation. Filming took place in Long Beach, California, where the Balboa studios were located. Footage of an actual church under construction {{across the street from}} the studio was used for a scene <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>one</b> was built by St. Elmo. Contemporary writers credited Bertram Bracken as director, as do some modern sources, including the American Film Institute. Others consider the film the directorial debut of J. Gordon Edwards. Both men subsequently had long careers directing for Fox Film.|$|E

A group of people (<b>In</b> <b>which</b> <b>one</b> of them is YouTube star, Wendy McColm) pull up in cars and they also lip-synch the song, in addition to performing other activities throughout the video.

5|$|Many welding {{processes}} {{require the use}} of a particular joint design; for example, resistance spot welding, laser beam welding, and electron beam welding are most frequently performed on lap joints. Other welding methods, like shielded metal arc welding, are extremely versatile and can weld virtually any type of joint. Some processes {{can also be used to}} make multipass welds, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>one</b> weld is allowed to cool, and then another weld is performed on top of it. This allows for the welding of thick sections arranged in a single-V preparation joint, for example.|$|E

5|$|Most useful ATP analogs {{cannot be}} hydrolyzed as ATP would be; instead they trap the enzyme in a {{structure}} {{closely related to}} the ATP-bound state. Adenosine 5′-(γ-thiotriphosphate) is an extremely common ATP analog <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>one</b> of the gamma-phosphate oxygens is replaced by a sulfur atom; this anion is hydrolyzed at a dramatically slower rate than ATP itself and functions as an inhibitor of ATP-dependent processes. In crystallographic studies, hydrolysis transition states are modeled by the bound vanadate ion. However, caution is warranted in interpreting the results of experiments using ATP analogs, since some enzymes can hydrolyze them at appreciable rates at high concentration.|$|E
