5|$|Having {{electric}} charge, mass, color charge, and flavor, quarks are {{the only}} known elementary particles that engage in all four fundamental interactions of contemporary physics: electromagnetism, <b>gravitation,</b> strong interaction, and weak interaction. <b>Gravitation</b> is too weak to be relevant to individual particle interactions except at extremes of energy (Planck energy) and distance scales (Planck distance). However, since no successful quantum theory of gravity exists, <b>gravitation</b> is not described by the Standard Model.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} is {{a theory}} of <b>gravitation</b> that was developed by Albert Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational effect between masses results from their warping of spacetime.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} is {{the geometric}} theory of <b>gravitation</b> published by Albert Einstein in 1915 {{and the current}} description of <b>gravitation</b> in modern physics. It {{is the basis of}} current cosmological models of the Universe. General relativity generalizes special relativity and Newton's law of universal <b>gravitation,</b> providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. In particular, the curvature of spacetime {{is directly related to the}} energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of partial differential equations. In general relativity, the distribution of matter and energy determines the geometry of spacetime, which in turn describes the acceleration of matter. Therefore, solutions of the Einstein field equations describe the evolution of the Universe. Combined with measurements of the amount, type, and distribution of matter in the Universe, the equations of general relativity describe the evolution of the Universe over time.|$|E
5|$|Escher's artwork is {{especially}} well liked by mathematicians like Doris Schattschneider and scientists like Roger Penrose, who enjoy {{his use of}} polyhedra and geometric distortions. For example, in <b>Gravitation,</b> animals climb around a stellated dodecahedron.|$|E
5|$|Kepler is a {{key figure}} in the 17th-century {{scientific}} revolution. He {{is best known for his}} laws of planetary motion, based on his works Astronomia nova, Harmonices Mundi, and Epitome of Copernican Astronomy. These works also provided one of the foundations for Isaac Newton's theory of universal <b>gravitation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Renormalizability {{has become}} an {{essential}} criterion for a quantum field theory to {{be considered as a}} viable one. All the theories describing fundamental interactions, except <b>gravitation</b> whose quantum counterpart is presently under very active research, are renormalizable theories.|$|E
5|$|The weak {{interaction}} takes place only at very small, sub-atomic distances, {{less than the}} diameter of a proton. It {{is one of the}} four known fundamental interactions of nature, alongside the strong interaction, electromagnetism, and <b>gravitation.</b>|$|E
5|$|While general {{relativity}} replaces the scalar gravitational potential of classical physics by a symmetric rank-two tensor, the latter reduces {{to the former}} in certain limiting cases. For weak gravitational fields and slow speed relative to the speed of light, the theory's predictions converge on those of Newton's law of universal <b>gravitation.</b>|$|E
5|$|All of this cosmic {{evolution}} {{after the}} inflationary epoch can be rigorously described and modeled by the ΛCDM model of cosmology, which uses the independent frameworks {{of quantum mechanics}} and Einstein's General Relativity. There is no well-supported model describing the action prior to 10−15 seconds or so. Apparently a new unified theory of quantum <b>gravitation</b> is needed to break this barrier. Understanding this earliest of eras {{in the history of}} the universe is currently one of the greatest unsolved problems in physics.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Newton's law of universal <b>gravitation</b> had been accepted for more than two hundred years as a valid description of the gravitational force between masses. In Newton's model, gravity is the result of an attractive force between massive objects. Although even Newton was troubled by the unknown nature of that force, the basic framework was extremely successful at describing motion.|$|E
5|$|Experiments and {{observations}} show that Einstein's description of <b>gravitation</b> accounts for several effects that are unexplained by Newton's law, such as minute anomalies in {{the orbits of}} Mercury and other planets. General relativity also predicts novel effects of gravity, such as gravitational waves, gravitational lensing and an effect of gravity on time known as gravitational time dilation. Many of these predictions have been confirmed by experiment or observation, most recently gravitational waves.|$|E
5|$|Finally {{the tidal}} radius, or Hill sphere, is the {{distance}} {{from the center of the}} globular cluster at which the external <b>gravitation</b> of the galaxy has more influence over the stars in the cluster than does the cluster itself. This is the distance at which the individual stars belonging to a cluster can be separated away by the galaxy. The tidal radius of M3 is about 40 arc minutes, or about 113 pc at the distance of 10.4 kpc.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} (GR) is {{a theory}} of <b>gravitation</b> that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping {{of space and time}} by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Einstein {{predicted}} gravitational waves, ripples in {{the curvature}} of spacetime which propagate as waves, traveling {{outward from the}} source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its Lorentz invariance which brings {{the concept of a}} finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it. By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the Newtonian theory of <b>gravitation,</b> which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.|$|E
5|$|In Newton's {{description}} of gravity, the gravitational force {{is caused by}} matter. More precisely, it {{is caused by a}} specific property of material objects: their mass. In Einstein's theory and related theories of <b>gravitation,</b> curvature at every point in spacetime is also caused by whatever matter is present. Here, too, mass is a key property in determining the gravitational influence of matter. But in a relativistic theory of gravity, mass cannot be the only source of gravity. Relativity links mass with energy, and energy with momentum.|$|E
5|$|Kepler was {{the first}} to devise a system that {{described}} correctly the details of the motion of the planets with the Sun at the center. However, Kepler did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote down. It was left to Newton's invention of celestial dynamics and his law of <b>gravitation</b> to finally explain the motions of the planets. Newton also developed the reflecting telescope.|$|E
5|$|Mercury's orbit, however, did {{not match}} that {{predicted}} by Newton's Law of <b>Gravitation.</b> Some astrophysicists predicted the existence of another planet (Vulcan) that would explain the discrepancies; however no such planet could be found. When Albert Einstein formulated his theory of general relativity (GR) {{he turned his attention}} to the problem of Mercury's orbit and found that his theory added a correction, which could account for the discrepancy. This was the first time that Newton's Theory of Gravity had been shown to be inexact.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the four}} {{fundamental}} interactions, <b>gravitation</b> is dominant at cosmological length scales, including galaxies and larger-scale structures. Gravity's effects are cumulative; by contrast, {{the effects of}} positive and negative charges tend to cancel one another, making electromagnetism relatively insignificant on cosmological length scales. The remaining two interactions, the weak and strong nuclear forces, decline very rapidly with distance; their effects are confined mainly to sub-atomic length scales.|$|E
5|$|Phenomena modeled by {{theoretical}} astronomers include: stellar {{dynamics and}} evolution; galaxy formation; large-scale distribution of {{matter in the}} Universe; origin of cosmic rays; general relativity and physical cosmology, including string cosmology and astroparticle physics. Astrophysical relativity serves {{as a tool to}} gauge the properties of large scale structures for which <b>gravitation</b> plays a significant role in physical phenomena investigated and as the basis for black hole (astro)physics and the study of gravitational waves.|$|E
5|$|Quarks have various {{intrinsic}} properties, including electric charge, mass, color charge, and spin. Quarks are {{the only}} elementary particles in the Standard Model of particle physics to experience all four fundamental interactions, also known as fundamental forces (electromagnetism, <b>gravitation,</b> strong interaction, and weak interaction), {{as well as the}} only known particles whose electric charges are not integer multiples of the elementary charge.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} scientific {{models of}} the Universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers and were geocentric, placing Earth at {{the centre of the}} Universe. Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led Nicolaus Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at the centre of the Solar System. In developing the law of universal <b>gravitation,</b> Sir Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus's work as well as observations by Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler's laws of planetary motion.|$|E
5|$|Venus {{may have}} formed from the solar nebula with a {{different}} rotation period and obliquity, reaching its current state because of chaotic spin changes caused by planetary perturbations and tidal effects on its dense atmosphere, a change that would have occurred {{over the course of}} billions of years. The rotation period of Venus may represent an equilibrium state between tidal locking to the Sun's <b>gravitation,</b> which tends to slow rotation, and an atmospheric tide created by solar heating of the thick Venusian atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|With the {{publication}} of his Principia roughly eighty years later (1687), Isaac Newton provided a physical theory that accounted for all three of Kepler's laws, a theory based on Newton's laws of motion and his law of universal <b>gravitation.</b> In particular, Newton proposed that the gravitational force between any two bodies was a central force F(r) that varied as the inverse square of the distance r between them. Arguing from his laws of motion, Newton showed that the orbit of any particle acted upon by one such force is always a conic section, specifically an ellipse if it does not go to infinity. However, this conclusion holds only when two bodies are present (the two-body problem); the motion of three bodies or more acting under their mutual <b>gravitation</b> (the n-body problem) remained unsolved for centuries after Newton, although solutions to a few special cases were discovered. Newton proposed that the orbits of planets about the Sun are largely elliptical because the Sun's <b>gravitation</b> is dominant; to first approximation, the presence of the other planets can be ignored. By analogy, the elliptical orbit of the Moon about the Earth was dominated by the Earth's gravity; to first approximation, the Sun's gravity and those of other bodies of the Solar System can be neglected. However, Newton stated that the gradual apsidal precession of the planetary and lunar orbits was due to the effects of these neglected interactions; in particular, he stated that the precession of the Moon's orbit was due to the perturbing effects of gravitational interactions with the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Ehlers {{became a}} member of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities (1993), the Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur, Mainz (1972), the Leopoldina in Halle (1975) and the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities in Munich (1979). From 1995 to 1998, he served as {{president}} of the International Society on General Relativity and <b>Gravitation.</b> He also received the 2002 Max Planck Medal of the German Physical Society, the Volta Gold Medal of Pavia University (2005) and the medal of the Faculty of Natural Sciences of Charles University, Prague (2007).|$|E
5|$|Einstein {{became a}} full {{professor}} at the German Charles-Ferdinand University in Prague in April 1911, accepting Austrian citizenship in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to do so. During his Prague stay, he wrote 11 scientific works, five of them on radiation mathematics and on the quantum theory of solids. In July 1912, {{he returned to his}} alma mater in Zürich. From 1912 until 1914, he was professor of theoretical physics at the ETH Zurich, where he taught analytical mechanics and thermodynamics. He also studied continuum mechanics, the molecular theory of heat, and the problem of <b>gravitation,</b> on which he worked with mathematician and friend Marcel Grossmann.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{there have}} been many ideas of the cosmos (cosmologies) and its origin (cosmogonies). Theories of an impersonal Universe governed by {{physical}} laws were first proposed by the Greeks and Indians. Ancient Chinese philosophy encompassed the notion of the Universe including both all of space and all of time. Over the centuries, improvements in astronomical observations and theories of motion and <b>gravitation</b> led to ever more accurate descriptions of the Universe. The modern era of cosmology began with Albert Einstein's 1915 general theory of relativity, which made it possible to quantitatively predict the origin, evolution, and conclusion of the Universe as a whole. Most modern, accepted theories of cosmology are based on general relativity and, more specifically, the predicted Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|In {{fields such}} as {{astrophysics}} or meteorology, where direct observation or laboratory experiments are difficult or impossible, the scientific method instead relies on observation and logical inference. In such fields, the test of falsifiability is satisfied when a theory is used to predict the results of new observations. When such observations contradict a theory's predictions, it may be revised or discarded if an alternative better explains the observed facts. For example, Newton's theory of <b>gravitation</b> was replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity when the latter was observed to more precisely predict the orbit of Mercury.|$|E
5|$|Noether {{was brought}} to Göttingen in 1915 by David Hilbert and Felix Klein, who wanted her {{expertise}} in invariant theory to help them in understanding general relativity, a geometrical theory of <b>gravitation</b> developed mainly by Albert Einstein. Hilbert had observed that the conservation of energy seemed to be violated in general relativity, because gravitational energy could itself gravitate. Noether provided the resolution of this paradox, and a fundamental tool of modern theoretical physics, with Noether's first theorem, which she proved in 1915, but did not publish until 1918. She not only solved the problem for general relativity, but also determined the conserved quantities for every system of physical laws that possesses some continuous symmetry.|$|E
5|$|The Principia was {{published}} on 5 July 1687 with encouragement and financial help from Edmond Halley. In this work, Newton stated the three universal laws of motion. Together, these laws describe {{the relationship between}} any object, the forces acting upon it and the resulting motion, laying the foundation for classical mechanics. They contributed to many advances during the Industrial Revolution which soon followed and were not improved upon for more than 200 years. Many of these advancements {{continue to be the}} underpinnings of non-relativistic technologies in the modern world. He used the Latin word gravitas (weight) for the effect that would become known as gravity, and defined the law of universal <b>gravitation.</b>|$|E
5|$|The initial hot, dense {{state is}} called the Planck epoch, a brief period {{extending}} from time zero to one Planck time unit of approximately 10−43 seconds. During the Planck epoch, all types of matter and all types of energy were concentrated into a dense state, where <b>gravitation</b> {{is believed to have}} been as strong as the other fundamental forces, and all the forces may have been unified. Since the Planck epoch, the Universe has been expanding to its present form, possibly with a very brief period of cosmic inflation which caused the Universe to reach a much larger size in less than 10−32 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The laws {{of nature}} were long thought to remain the same under mirror reflection. The results of an {{experiment}} viewed via a mirror {{were expected to be}} identical to the results of a mirror-reflected copy of the experimental apparatus. This so-called law of parity conservation was known to be respected by classical <b>gravitation,</b> electromagnetism and the strong interaction; it was assumed to be a universal law. However, in the mid-1950s Chen-Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee suggested that the weak interaction might violate this law. Chien Shiung Wu and collaborators in 1957 discovered that the weak interaction violates parity, earning Yang and Lee the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics.|$|E
5|$|This angular scaling {{can be seen}} in the apsidal precession, i.e., in {{the gradual}} {{rotation}} of the long axis of the ellipse (Figure3). As noted above, the orbit as a whole rotates with a mean angular speed Ω=(k−1)ω, where ω equals the mean angular speed of the particle about the stationary ellipse. If the particle requires a time T to move from one apse to the other, this implies that, in the same time, the long axis will rotate by an angle β=ΩT=(k−1)ωT=(k−1)×180°. For an inverse-square law such as Newton's law of universal <b>gravitation,</b> where n equals 1, there is no angular scaling (k=1), the apsidal angle α is 180°, and the elliptical orbit is stationary (Ω=β=0).|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} central forces—those that {{increase}} linearly with distance, F = Cr, such as Hooke's law, and inverse-square forces, , such as Newton's law of universal <b>gravitation</b> and Coulomb's law—have {{a very unusual}} property. A particle moving under either type of force always returns to its starting place with its initial velocity, provided that it lacks sufficient energy to move out to infinity. In other words, {{the path of a}} bound particle is always closed and its motion repeats indefinitely, no matter what its initial position or velocity. As shown by Bertrand's theorem, this property is not true for other types of forces; in general, a particle will not return to its starting point with the same velocity.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} {{has emerged}} as a highly successful model of <b>gravitation</b> and cosmology, which has so far passed many unambiguous observational and experimental tests. However, there are strong indications the theory is incomplete. The problem of quantum gravity and the question of the reality of spacetime singularities remain open. Observational data that is taken as evidence for dark energy and dark matter could indicate the need for new physics. Even taken as is, general relativity is rich with possibilities for further exploration. Mathematical relativists seek {{to understand the nature of}} singularities and the fundamental properties of Einstein's equations, while numerical relativists run increasingly powerful computer simulations (such as those describing merging black holes). In February 2016, it was announced that the existence of gravitational waves was directly detected by the Advanced LIGO team on September 14, 2015. A century after its introduction, general relativity remains a highly active area of research.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} is a metric {{theory of}} <b>gravitation.</b> At its core are Einstein's equations, which describe {{the relation between}} the geometry of a four-dimensional, pseudo-Riemannian manifold representing spacetime, and the energy–momentum contained in that spacetime. Phenomena that in classical mechanics are ascribed to the action of the force of gravity (such as free-fall, orbital motion, and spacecraft trajectories), correspond to inertial motion within a curved geometry of spacetime in general relativity; there is no gravitational force deflecting objects from their natural, straight paths. Instead, gravity corresponds to changes in the properties of space and time, which in turn changes the straightest-possible paths that objects will naturally follow. The curvature is, in turn, caused by the energy–momentum of matter. Paraphrasing the relativist John Archibald Wheeler, spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.|$|E
5|$|In 1679, Newton {{returned}} to his work on (celestial) mechanics by considering <b>gravitation</b> {{and its effect on}} the orbits of planets with reference to Kepler's laws of planetary motion. This followed stimulation by a brief exchange of letters in 1679–80 with Hooke, who had been appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, and who opened a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions. Newton's reawakening interest in astronomical matters received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 1680–1681, on which he corresponded with John Flamsteed. After the exchanges with Hooke, Newton worked out proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector (see Newton's law of universal gravitation– History and De motu corporum in gyrum). Newton communicated his results to Edmond Halley and to the Royal Society in De motu corporum in gyrum, a tract written on about nine sheets which was copied into the Royal Society's Register Book in December 1684. This tract contained the nucleus that Newton developed and expanded to form the Principia.|$|E
