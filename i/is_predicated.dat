5|$|Despite the poem's {{doubt and}} darkness, {{a note of}} hope is struck by {{the first line of}} the fifth section, 'So here I am in the middle way'. This refers to the first line of Dante's Inferno, 'Midway in our life's journey, I went astray'.

5|$|According to Theravada commentaries, {{there are}} five {{requisite}} factors that must all be fulfilled for an act to be both an act of killing and to be karmically negative. These are: (1) {{the presence of a}} living being, human or animal; (2) the knowledge that the being is a living being; (3) the intent to kill; (4) the act of killing by some means; and (5) the resulting death. Some Buddhists have argued on this basis that the act of killing is complicated, and its ethicization <b>is</b> <b>predicated</b> upon intent. Some have argued that in defensive postures, for example, the primary intention of a soldier is not to kill, but to defend against aggression, and the act of killing in that situation would have minimal negative karmic repercussions.|$|E

25|$|In addition, Aristotle {{disagreed}} with Plato about {{the location of}} universals. As Plato spoke {{of the world of}} the forms, a location where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal <b>is</b> <b>predicated.</b> So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than {{in the world of the}} forms.|$|E
25|$|When the anticipatory warrant <b>is</b> <b>predicated</b> on a {{triggering}} condition, the Fourth Amendment {{requires that}} there is probable cause {{to believe that the}} triggering condition will occur, and that if it occurs, {{that there is}} a fair probability that the contraband will be found at the place to be searched. In this case, the warrant application satisfied both conditions, based on the delivery of the tape as the triggering condition.|$|E

25|$|For several decades, {{researchers}} have also pursued various forms of suspended animation as {{a means by which}} to indefinitely extend mammalian lifespan. Some scientists have voiced support for the feasibility of the cryopreservation of humans, known as cryonics. Cryonics <b>is</b> <b>predicated</b> on the concept that some people considered clinically dead by today's medicolegal standards are not actually dead according to information-theoretic death and can, in principle, be resuscitated given sufficient technological advances. The goal of current cryonics procedures is tissue vitrification, a technique first used to reversibly cryopreserve a viable whole organ in 2005.|$|E
25|$|The {{series has}} also {{attracted}} some criticism from other pawnbrokers, who while conceding its entertainment value, {{claim that the}} series' focus on the extravagant vintage items brought into the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop are not typical of the average pawn shop, whose business <b>is</b> <b>predicated</b> on individuals on fixed income who bring in conventional objects {{in order to pay}} their bills, such as electronics, tools and jewelry. Corey Grigson and Charles Brown, who own a shop called Pawn Stars, estimate that their average loan to a customer is between $50 and $100. They also point out appraisals are handled by the staff, who rely on experience, reference works and research, and not the outside experts who are frequently seen on the show aiding the Harrisons.|$|E
25|$|Yes, I suppose. The {{violence}} {{served a}} therapeutic purpose. It's unsettling {{to think that}} at any moment life can flare up into senseless violence. But it can and does, and {{people need to be}} ready for it. What you make for others is first of all what you make for yourself. If I’m persuaded that our life <b>is</b> <b>predicated</b> upon violence, that the entire structure of what we call civilization, the scaffolding that we’ve built up over the millennia, can collapse at any moment, then whatever I write is going to be affected by that assumption. The process of life presupposes violence, in the plant world the same as the animal world. But among the animals only man can conceptualize violence. Only man can enjoy the idea of destruction.|$|E

25|$|Doyle and Sambanis' {{analysis}} {{finds that}} lasting peace {{is more likely}} after non-ethnic wars in countries with a relatively high level of development in addition {{to whether or not}} UN peacekeeping forces and financial assistance are available. They conclude that in the short run lasting peace is more dependent on a robust UN deployment coupled with low levels of hostility between belligerents. They note that increased economic capacity can provide an incentive not to renew hostilities. In the long run, however, economic capacity matters far more whereas the degree of hostility between belligerents is less important. As successful as UN deployments can be, they have inadequately spurred independent economic development within the countries where they have intervened. Thus, the UN plays a strong, but indirect role and success in lasting peace <b>is</b> <b>predicated</b> on the development of institutions that support peace, rather than serving as a deterrent for renewed war.|$|E
25|$|In this way, Wodiczko’s visual {{repertoire}} for his projections expanded {{beyond the}} body (ears, eyes, and hands {{as indicators of}} human sensibility) to include chains, missiles, tanks, coins, cameras, boots, swastikas, guns, candles, food baskets, and corporate logos. “In these projections,” writes Kathleen MacQueen, “the artist alternates between symbolic, iconic, and indexical images – the principal relations an image can have to its subject, according to the writings of Charles Sanders Peirce – that <b>is,</b> <b>predicated</b> on a cultural reference, a physical resemblance, or a physical relation respectively. In many instances they scramble all relations: the hand, an index of the body – someone’s body – is also an iconic representation of communication that might symbolically represent an open or closed ideological position.” The reductive, visual signs monumentally-sized to fit the facades on which they are projected, {{are not meant to}} read as logos for a political agenda, instead they suggest a perceptual contradiction to disrupt the kind of assumptions that beset the casual passerby.|$|E

25|$|This {{picture of}} Spinoza's {{determinism}} is ever more illuminated through reading this famous quote in Ethics: ″the infant {{believes that it}} is by free will that it seeks the breast; the angry boy believes that by free will he wishes vengeance; the timid man thinks it is with free will he seeks flight; the drunkard believes that by a free command of his mind he speaks the things which when sober he wishes he had left unsaid. … All believe that they speak by a free command of the mind, whilst, in truth, they have no power to restrain the impulse which they have to speak.″ Thus for Spinoza morality and ethical judgement like choice <b>is</b> <b>predicated</b> on an illusion. For Spinoza, ″Blame″ and ″Praise″ are non existent human ideals only fathomable in the mind because we are so acclimatized to human consciousness interlinking with our experience {{that we have a}} false ideal of choice predicated upon this.|$|E
500|$|North Omaha has a {{contentious}} history between whites and African Americans that <b>is</b> <b>predicated</b> on racism. In 1891 an African American George Smith was lynched at the Douglas County Courthouse, accused {{as a suspect}} for allegedly attacking a young girl.

500|$|The Matsya Purana and Devi Purana {{prescribe}} that Matrika shrines {{should be}} north-facing and {{be placed in}} northern part of a temple-complex. The temples of the Matrikas are found earliest dating to the fourth century and from textual evidence, it <b>is</b> <b>predicated</b> that [...] "there must be impressive shrines all over the [...] subcontinent". Although circular Mandalas and Chakras are mentioned in religious texts, most existing shrines are rectangular in nature. Pal speculates that earlier circular shrines, which open to the sky or under trees of less durable material were replaced by the Guptas in stone as rectangular shrines.|$|E
60|$|It is {{necessary}} to distinguish general from collective names. A general name is one which can <b>be</b> <b>predicated</b> of each individual of a multitude; a collective name can not <b>be</b> <b>predicated</b> of each separately, but only of all taken together. “The 76th regiment of foot in the British army,” which is a collective name, is not a general but an individual name; for though it can <b>be</b> <b>predicated</b> of a multitude of individual soldiers taken jointly, it can not <b>be</b> <b>predicated</b> of them severally. We may say, Jones is a soldier, and Thompson is a soldier, and Smith is a soldier, {{but we can not}} say, Jones is the 76th regiment, and Thompson is the 76th regiment, and Smith is the 76th regiment. We can only say, Jones, and Thompson, and Smith, and Brown, and so forth (enumerating all the soldiers), are the 76th regiment.|$|R

500|$|There is no {{legislation}} that defines when death has occurred.

Much medical law [...] for example, that conferring the right to remove organs for transplant [...] <b>is</b> <b>predicated</b> on this decision and {{it is unlikely to}} be overturned. The Criminal Law Revision Committee has declined to propose a legal definition, for fear of the wide impact that it could have on disparate branches of the law, and the changing basis in medical science. In Bland, a person in a persistent vegetative state was considered to be alive; accordingly, anything less than brain stem cessation is unlikely to be sufficient for death.|$|E
500|$|In her {{review for}} The New York Times, {{based on a}} {{screening}} at the New York Film Festival, Manohla Dargis observes that [...] "throughout the movie Mr. Soderbergh mixes the wild beauty of his landscapes with images of Che heroically engaged in battle, thoughtfully scribbling and reading, and tending to ailing peasants and soldiers". According to Dargis, [...] "Che wins, Che loses, but Che remains the same in what plays like a procedural about a charismatic leader, impossible missions and the pleasures of work and camaraderie", referring to the [...] "historical epic" [...] as [...] "Ocean's Eleven with better cigars". However, Dargis notes that [...] "Mr. Soderbergh cagily evades Che's ugly side, notably his increasing commitment to violence and seemingly endless war, but the movie is without question political—even if it emphasizes romantic adventure over realpolitik—because, like all films, it <b>is</b> <b>predicated</b> on getting, spending and making money".|$|E
