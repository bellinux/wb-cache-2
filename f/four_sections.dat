5|$|Late in the Nineteenth Dynasty the Book of Caverns, which {{divided the}} underworld into massive caverns {{containing}} deities {{as well as}} the deceased waiting for the sun to pass through and restore them to life, was placed in the upper parts of tombs. A complete version appears in the tomb of Ramesses VI. The burial of Ramesses III saw the Book of the Earth, where the underworld is divided into <b>four</b> <b>sections,</b> climaxing in the sun disc being pulled from the earth by Naunet.|$|E

However, after the polo game, during MacMillan's explanation to Waterford that Craig W.

In November 1916, each company was reformed as a battalion of three companies, with plans to increase the Corps to 20 battalions, each Tank Battalion had a complement of 32 officers and 374 men.|$|E
5|$|Some sections, such as Metro, {{are only}} {{found in the}} editions of the paper {{distributed}} in the New York–New Jersey–Connecticut Tri-state area {{and not in the}} national or Washington, D.C. editions. Aside from a weekly roundup of reprints of editorial cartoons from other newspapers, The New York Times does not have its own staff editorial cartoonist, nor does it feature a comics page or Sunday comics section. In September 2008, The New York Times announced that it would be combining certain sections effective October 6, 2008, in editions printed in the New York metropolitan area. The changes folded the Metro Section into the main International / National news section and combined Sports and Business (except Saturday through Monday, when Sports is still printed as a standalone section). This change also included having the name of the Metro section be called New York outside of the Tri-State Area. The presses used by The New York Times allow <b>four</b> <b>sections</b> to be printed simultaneously; as the paper had included more than <b>four</b> <b>sections</b> all days except Saturday, the sections had to be printed separately in an early press run and collated together. The changes will allow The New York Times to print in <b>four</b> <b>sections</b> Monday through Wednesday, in addition to Saturday. The New York Times announcement stated that the number of news pages and employee positions will remain unchanged, with the paper realizing cost savings by cutting overtime expenses.|$|E

5|$|The Operations Research Section (ORS) {{was also}} set up {{in light of the}} success of such {{programs}} in Fighter and Bomber Commands. Many scientists were appointed to the ORS Coastal Command. Some acted as advisors to Air Marshal Bowhill. <b>Four</b> <b>sections</b> were set up; planned flying and maintenance, ASO, A/S, and weather and navigation. Resources were spread evenly. However, A/S received more attention. The rest did not receive close attention until 1943, when the U-boats had been contained and a certain degree of ascendancy achieved.|$|E
5|$|After Genghis Khan's {{death in}} 1227, his empire was divided by his {{descendants}} into <b>four</b> <b>sections</b> or Khanates, which degenerated into civil war. The northwestern Kipchak Khanate, {{known as the}} Golden Horde, expanded towards Europe, primarily via Hungary and Poland, while its leaders simultaneously opposed the rule of their cousins back at the Mongol capital. The southwestern section, known as the Ilkhanate, was {{under the leadership of}} Genghis Khan's grandson Hulagu. He continued to support his brother, the Great Khan, and was therefore at war with the Golden Horde, {{while at the same time}} continuing an advance towards Persia and the Holy Land.|$|E
5|$|Although the Hiorns had descendants, {{the estate}} was {{managed by the}} Public Trustee, who put Linwood House up for sale as <b>four</b> <b>{{sections}},</b> {{with one of those}} holding the house itself. Three of the sections were purchased by Thomas Marker on 4 June 1913 in an auction, including the one containing the building. Marker paid ₤200 each for the building sections, and ₤1,250 for the section containing the house. The furniture of Linwood House was sold in a separate auction. The house was rented to lawyer Francis Ion Cowlishaw, son of prominent provincial councillor William Patten Cowlishaw (1839–1903). Cowlishaw senior had lived nearby in a house named 'Chaddesden', and Cowlishaw Street and Chaddesden Lane are named after the family.|$|E

5|$|Flood waters {{from the}} Murchison River {{finally began to}} recede on 17 March; however, it took several weeks for the river to return to its normal level. Although Emma had only minor effects in Carnarvon, the town enacted a A$14million ($10million USD) flood {{protection}} plan {{in the wake of}} the storm. The plan would lead to the construction of new levees in areas surrounding the town and keep flood waters within Nicol Bay Flats. Additionally, <b>four</b> <b>sections</b> of the North West Coastal Highway were set to be upgraded for similar reasons. Due to the combined effects of Cyclones Clare, Darryl, Jim, Emma, Kate and Glenda, gold production in Australia fell by 8 percent, resulting in earnings losses of A$130million.|$|E
5|$|George Bentham {{published}} a thorough revision of Banksia in his landmark publication Flora Australiensis in 1870. In Bentham's arrangement, {{the number of}} recognised Banksia species was reduced from 60 to 46. Bentham defined <b>four</b> <b>sections</b> based on leaf, style and pollen-presenter characters. Banksia caleyi was placed in section Orthostylis. In his 1891 work Revisio Generum Plantarum, German botanist Otto Kuntze challenged the generic name Banksia L.f., {{on the grounds that}} the name Banksia had previously been published in 1775 as Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst, referring to the genus now known as Pimelea. Kuntze proposed Sirmuellera as an alternative, republishing B.caleyi as Sirmuellera caleyi. The challenge failed, and Banksia L.f. was formally conserved in 1940.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, George Bentham {{published}} a thorough revision of Banksia in his landmark publication Flora Australiensis. In Bentham's arrangement, {{the number of}} recognised Banksia species was reduced from 60 to 46. Bentham observed that the characteristics Brown used to define B.australis, B.depressa, B.patula, and B.insularis were unable to distinguish separate forms as more specimens came to light, and hence declared them synonyms of B.marginata. Meissner's four series were replaced by <b>four</b> <b>sections</b> based on leaf, style and pollen-presenter characters. B.marginata was placed in section Eubanksia along with B.integrifolia and B.dentata.|$|E

5|$|The Welsh Pony and Cob is a {{group of}} four closelyrelated horse breeds {{including}} both pony and cob types, which originated in Wales in the United Kingdom. The <b>four</b> <b>sections</b> within the breed society for the Welsh breeds are primarily distinguished by height, and also by variations in type: the smallest Welsh Mountain Pony (Section A); the slightly taller but refined Welsh Pony of riding type (Section B) popular as a children's show mount; the small but stocky Welsh Pony of Cob Type (Section C), popular for riding and competitive driving; and the tallest, the Welsh Cob (Section D), which can be ridden by adults. Welsh ponies and cobs in all sections are known for their good temperament, hardiness, and free-moving gaits.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} {{began in}} 1181. The monastic quarters {{and the church}} were built over the following three decades. The central cloister was bordered on the north by the church, on the west by a barrel-vaulted great nave, on the east by the sacristy, the priory cell, and the chapter house, and on the south by the kitchen, the pantry and the refectory (dining hall). Some of the buildings were given seven-foot-thick (2m) walls with slit windows, {{to serve as a}} refuge in case the Moors returned to the area. The church was built {{in the shape of a}} Latin cross with a nave divided into <b>four</b> <b>sections,</b> and a sanctuary with three square apses. Its presbytery had a central square topped by a pentagon.|$|E

It was only after Frost raised several objections with a more senior officer at headquarters that he was informed of the intended raid, after which the Major dropped his objections and turned his attention to training the company.|$|E
