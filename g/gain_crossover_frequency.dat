40|$|In today's {{electronics}} market, {{highly efficient}} DC-DC power converters are in great demand for battery-operated portable electronic devices. Voltage-mode switching power converter {{is widely used}} to provide a stable voltage to the portable devices as it has higher efficiency than the current-mode counterpart. Frequency compensation is critical in the controller design as it not only determines the loop gain but also the stability and the dynamic response of the converter. However, the conventional dominant-pole compensation technique only provides a small loop <b>gain</b> <b>crossover</b> <b>frequency</b> and thus results in slow dynamic response. In this thesis, a new frequency compensation scheme, which consists of a single-pole error amplifier and a high-pass notch filter in the compensator, is proposed. With the proposed compensation scheme, the loop <b>gain</b> <b>crossover</b> <b>frequency</b> can be significantly increased and thus the dynamic responses greatly improved. Two hardware prototypes of the buck converters with the conventional and the proposed schemes have been experimentally tested with different output ripple voltages. Measurement {{results show that the}} loop <b>gain</b> <b>crossover</b> <b>frequency</b> of the converter with the proposed scheme is 132 times larger than that with the conventional scheme. Under a load step of 400 mA, the maximum output overshoot voltage of the proposed scheme is 4 times less than the conventional one while the transient response of the proposed scheme achieves 93 times improvement. In addition, converters with the proposed scheme under different output ripple voltages give the same loop <b>gain</b> <b>crossover</b> <b>frequency</b> as opposed to different loop gain crossover frequencies obtained from conventional scheme. Thus the robustness of the converter is also improved...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{performance}} {{capabilities and}} limitations of control interfaces for the operation of active movement-assistive devices remain unclear. Selecting an optimal interface for an application requires {{a thorough understanding of}} the performance of multiple control interfaces. Methods: In this study the performance of EMG-, force- and joystick-based control interfaces were assessed in healthy volunteers with a screen-based one-dimensional position-tracking task. The participants had to track a target that was moving according to a multisine signal with a bandwidth of 3 Hz. The velocity of the cursor was proportional to the interface signal. The performance of the control interfaces were evaluated in terms of tracking error, <b>gain</b> margin <b>crossover</b> <b>frequency,</b> information transmission rate and effort. Results: None of the evaluated interfaces was superior in all four performance descriptors. The EMG-based interface was superior in tracking error and <b>gain</b> margin <b>crossover</b> <b>frequency</b> compared to the force- and the joystick-based interfaces. The force-based interface provided higher information transmission rate and lower effort than the EMG-based interface. The joystick-based interface did not present any significant difference with the force-based interface for any of the four performance descriptors. We found that significant differences in terms of tracking error and information transmission rate were present beyond 0. 9 and 1. 4 Hz respectively. Conclusions: Despite the fact that the EMG-based interface is far from the natural way of interacting with the environment, while the force-based interface is closer, the EMG-based interface presented very similar and for some descriptors even a better performance than the force-based interface for frequencies below 1. 4 Hz. The classical joystick presented a similar performance to the force-based interface and holds the advantage of being a well established interface for the control of many assistive devices. From these findings we concluded that all the control interfaces considered in this study can be regarded as a candidate interface for the control of an active arm support.

50|$|A Linkwitz-Riley (L-R) filter is an {{infinite}} impulse response filter used in Linkwitz-Riley audio crossovers, named after its inventors Siegfried Linkwitz and Russ Riley, which was originally described in Active Crossover Networks for Noncoincident Drivers in JAES Volume 24 Issue 1 pp. 2-8; February 1976. It {{is also known}} as a Butterworth squared filter. An L-R crossover consists of a parallel combination of a low-pass and a high-pass L-R filter. The filters are usually designed by cascading two Butterworth filters, each of which has &minus;3 dB gain at the cut-off frequency. The resulting Linkwitz-Riley filter has a &minus;6 dB gain at the cutoff frequency. This means that summing the low-pass and high-pass outputs, the <b>gain</b> at the <b>crossover</b> <b>frequency</b> will be 0 dB, so the crossover behaves like an all-pass filter, having a flat amplitude response with a smoothly changing phase response. This is the biggest advantage of L-R crossovers compared to Butterworth crossovers, whose summed output has a +3 dB peak around the <b>crossover</b> <b>frequency.</b> Since cascading two nth order Butterworth filters will give a 2nd order Linkwitz-Riley filter, theoretically any 2nd order Linkwitz-Riley crossover can be designed. However, crossovers of higher order than 4th may have less usability due to their increasing peak in group delay around <b>crossover</b> <b>frequency</b> and complexity.|$|R

40|$|Classical {{controller}} design emphasizes simple low-order controllers. These classical controllers include Proportional-Integral (PI), Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID), and First Order. In modern control theory, it is customary {{to design}} high-order controllers based on models, even for simple plants. However, {{it was shown}} that such controllers are invariably fragile, and {{this led to a}} renewal of interest in classical design methods. In the present research, a modern approach to the design of classical controllers (by introducing a complete stabilizing set in the space of the design parameters) is described. When classical specifications such as gain margin, phase margin, bandwidth, and time-delay tolerance are imposed, the achievable performance can be easily determined graphically. The objective of this research is to determine the controller gains, contained in the stabilizing set, which satisfy desired performance specifications such as crossover frequency and closed-loop stability margins. The design procedure starts with the calculation of the stabilizing set using recent methods. Then, a simple parametrization produces ellipses and straight lines (for PI controller design) and cylinders and planes (for PID controller design) in the space of controller gains. Each set of ellipses/cylinders and straight lines/planes represents constant magnitude and constant phase loci for the controller. The main result is that the crossing points, which are the intersection of ellipses/cylinders and straight lines/planes, are selected such that they are contained in the stabilizing set of controllers. They provide the controller gains that we need to satisfy our desired robust performance, seen as desired gain margin, phase margin, <b>gain</b> <b>crossover</b> <b>frequency,</b> and time-delay tolerance in our system. Then, using these crossing points contained in the stabilizing set, a new plot with information about the achievable performance in terms of gain margin, phase margin, and <b>gain</b> <b>crossover</b> <b>frequency</b> is constructed. Each point of this achievable performance can be used to retrieve the controller?s gains, which are contained in the stabilizing set. This result provides the possibility to analyze the system?s achievable performance by exploring the stabilizing set and considering different desired configurations in the performance capabilities for the system using a PI or PID controller. This expands our possibilities when designing controllers by considering different classical controller?s configurations. This research considers the discrete-time and continuous-time linear time invariant systems and cases including First Order with time-delay in the system, and the extension to the controller design for multivariable systems. Finally, the design procedure is illustrated with different examples and real applications for all such cases...|$|E
