5|$|There are controlled-release {{versions}} of levodopa. Older controlled-release levodopa preparations have poor and unreliable absorption and bioavailability {{and have not}} demonstrated improved control of PD motor symptoms or a reduction in levodopa-related complications when compared to immediate release preparations. A newer extended-release levodopa preparation <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more effective in reducing fluctuations but in many patients problems persist. Intestinal infusions of levodopa (Duodopa) can result in striking improvements in fluctuations compared to oral levodopa when the fluctuations are due to insufficient uptake caused by gastroparesis. Other oral, longer acting formulations are under study and other modes of delivery (inhaled, transdermal) are being developed.|$|E
5|$|Olfactory {{navigation}} {{has been}} suggested as a possible mechanism in pigeons. Papi's 'mosaic' model argues that pigeons build and remember a mental map of the odours in their area, recognizing where they are by the local odour. Wallraff's 'gradient' model argues {{that there is a}} steady, large-scale gradient of odour which remains stable for long periods. If there were two or more such gradients in different directions, pigeons could locate themselves in two dimensions by the intensities of the odours. However {{it is not clear that}} such stable gradients exist. Papi did find evidence that anosmic pigeons (unable to detect odours) were much less able to orient and navigate than normal pigeons, so olfaction <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> important in pigeon navigation. However, it is not clear how olfactory cues are used.|$|E

25|$|The diet {{consists}} {{of a variety of}} small vertebrates, including mammals, lizards, and other snakes, as well as invertebrates such as centipedes. Mammals and reptiles make up the bulk of their diet. Adults feed mainly on rodents, while juveniles usually prey on reptiles: more often lizards in western populations and snakes in eastern ones. Frogs also constitute {{an important part of the}}ir diet: Ruthven (1928) mentioned that in Michigan they made up the main portion of their diet. According to Klauber (1956), S. catenatus feeds on frogs more frequently than any other rattlesnake. In general, however, frogs are not an important part of the diet, although this <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more typical in certain northern and eastern populations.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there is}} not any {{official}} definition {{of what constitutes a}} Cinderella team, there <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a consensus that such teams represent small schools, are usually low-seeded in the tournament, and achieves at least one unexpected win in the tournament. A recent example of this is Florida Gulf Coast University, a relatively new school that held its first classes in 1997 and became Division I postseason eligible in 2011. They made their first ever appearance in the 2013 tournament, winning two games to become the first ever #15 seed to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. The term was popularized as a result of City College of New York's successful run in the 1950 tournament.|$|E
25|$|This poem, {{traditionally}} placed at Amores 3.5, is considered spurious. The poet describes {{a dream to}} an interpreter, saying that he sees while escaping from the heat of noon a white heifer near a bull; when the heifer is pecked by a crow, it leaves the bull for a meadow with other bulls. The interpreter interprets the dream as a love allegory; the bull represents the poet, the heifer a girl, and the crow an old woman. The old woman spurs the girl to leave her lover and find someone else. The poem {{is known to have}} circulated independently and its lack of engagement with Tibullan or Propertian elegy argue in favor of its spuriousness; however, the poem <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> datable to the early empire.|$|E

25|$|There <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> general {{agreement}} from most sources that this monastery {{was on a}} large site; with monastic dwelling houses located roughly around the site {{of what is now}} the Kirkgate carpark, the Trafalgar Masonic Lodge, South Leith Parish Church Halls and some of the Henderson Street tenements. A burial ground was located to the south of these structures extending towards Great Junction Street. This has been substantiated by the discovery of a burial site in this location during the laying of gas pipes in St Anthony Street. The site of the monastery reputedly extended down to Henderson Gardens and all along the street still known as Yardheads. It is thought that the street name 'Yardheads' may derive from the old Germanic stem, in which the word Yard means a garden or orchard. This would suggest the monastery had large gardens and orchards extending to this point. It is said that the monastery suffered great damage during the Siege of Leith in 1560. After the Scottish Reformation the monastery was allowed to languish; other buildings being gradually erected in its place and removing all physical traces of its existence. The Seal of the Preceptory of St Anthony (used to authenticate official paperwork of the hospital / monastery and dating from the mid-1500s) is held at the National Museum of Scotland.|$|E
500|$|It {{could be}} that no special {{explanation}} is required: the slow process of evolution simply required 4 billion years to accumulate the necessary adaptations.

While the song <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> another observation of Factory denizens, Reed wrote the song before meeting Warhol, having recorded a demo in July 1965 at Ludlow Street.

500|$|In the 1930s and 1940s, critics {{emphasised}} {{the content}} of the poem, and some felt that it fell short of what was necessary to make it truly great. In 1930, William Empson, while praising the form of the poem as universal, argued against its merits because of its potential political message. He claimed that the poem [...] "as the context makes clear", means that [...] "18th-century England had no scholarship system of carriere ouverte aux talents. This is stated as pathetic, but the reader is put into a mood in which one would not try to alter it... By comparing the social arrangement to Nature he makes it seem inevitable, which it was not, and gives it a dignity which was undeserved. Furthermore, a gem does not mind being in a cave and a flower prefers not to be picked; we feel that man is like the flower, as short-lived, natural, and valuable, and this tricks us into feeling that he is better off without opportunities." [...] He continued: [...] "the truism of the reflection in the churchyard, the universality and impersonality this gives to the style, claim as if by comparison that we ought to accept the injustice of society as we do the inevitability of death." [...] T. S. Eliot’s 1932 collection of essays contained a comparison of the elegy to the sentiment found in metaphysical poetry: [...] "The feeling, the sensibility, expressed in the Country Churchyard (to say nothing of Tennyson and Browning) is cruder than that in the Coy Mistress." [...] Later, in 1947, Cleanth Brooks pointed out that [...] "In Gray's poem, the imagery <b>does</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> intrinsically poetic; the theme, true; the 'statement', free from ambiguity, and free from irony." [...] After describing various aspects and complexities within the poem, Brooks provided his view on the poem's conclusion: [...] "the reader may not be altogether convinced, as I am not altogether convinced, that the epitaph with which the poem closes is adequate. But surely its intended function is clear, and it is a necessary function if the poem is to have a structure and is not to be considered merely a loose collection of poetic passages." ...|$|E

2500|$|Two of Jameson's best-known claims from Postmodernism {{are that}} postmodernity is {{characterized}} by pastiche and a crisis in historicity.
