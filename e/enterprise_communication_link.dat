In {{order to}} provide effective <b>communication</b> <b>link</b> between two robots while physical link {{did not exist in}} unknown environments, a method of active <b>communication</b> <b>link</b> building on demand was proposed. Based on some model assumptions and definitions, a strategy named SSS was presented to build <b>communication</b> <b>link</b> in unknown environment by using link-increasing and link-rotating. Then the corresponding basic algorithm and improved algorithm were discussed and compared in simulation. The simulation indicated that <b>communication</b> <b>link</b> could be built successfully by employing these algorithms. And the improved algorithm had more optimal performances than basic one by estimating energy consumption and time consumption in link building process...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} to study control systems with feedback loops closed over wireless <b>communication</b> <b>links.</b> We show {{the choice of}} communication parameters can greatly affect the performance of such systems. The trade-offs of data rate, time delay and packet loss in the <b>communication</b> <b>link</b> layer design are illustrated with a numerical example of an inverted pendulum. Packet loss is shown to significantly degrade performance, which is not surprising since the controller design {{does not take into}} account random packet losses in the feedback loop. We thus propose an analog soft-decoding <b>communication</b> <b>link</b> design that does not incur any packet losses. It is shown that, for low channel gains, the control system closed over a soft-decoding <b>communication</b> <b>link</b> performs better than the same system closed over a hard-decoding <b>communication</b> <b>link</b> with optimal selection of sample period and data rate. This suggests fundamental changes in wireless link designs may be necessary to support robust distributed control systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A {{vehicular}} ad hoc network (VANET) is {{a promising}} {{addition to our}} future intelligent transportation systems, which supports various safety and infotainment applications. The high node mobility and frequent topology changes in VANETs impose new challenges on maintaining a long-lasting connection between network nodes. As a result, the lifetime of <b>communication</b> <b>links</b> is a crucial issue in VANET development and operation. This paper presents a probabilistic analysis of the <b>communication</b> <b>link</b> in VANETs for three vehicle density ranges. Firstly, we present the stationary distribution of the <b>communication</b> <b>link</b> length using mesoscopic mobility models. Secondly, we propose a stochastic microscopic mobility model that captures time variations of inter-vehicle distances (distance headways). A discrete-time finite-state Markov chain with state dependent transition probabilities is proposed to model the distance headway. Thirdly, the proposed stochastic microscopic model and first passage time analysis are used to derive the probability distribution of the <b>communication</b> <b>link</b> lifetime. Numerical results are presented to evaluate the proposed model, which demonstrate a close agreement between analytical and simulation results.

40|$|A {{network of}} microprocessors, or nodes, are {{interconnected}} in an n-dimensional cube having bidirectional <b>communication</b> <b>links</b> {{along the edges}} of the n-dimensional cube. Each node's processor network includes an I/O subprocessor dedicated to controlling communication of message packets along a bidirectional <b>communication</b> <b>link</b> with each end thereof terminating at an I/O controlled transceiver. Transmit data lines are directly connected from a local FIFO through each node's <b>communication</b> <b>link</b> transceiver. Status and control signals from the neighboring nodes are delivered over supervisory lines to inform the local node that the neighbor node's FIFO is empty and the bidirectional link between the two nodes is idle for data communication. A clocking line between neighbors, clocks a message into an empty FIFO at a neighbor's node and vica versa. Either neighbor may acquire control over the bidirectional <b>communication</b> <b>link</b> at any time, and thus each node has circuitry for checking whether or not the <b>communication</b> <b>link</b> is busy or idle, and whether or not the receive FIFO is empty. Likewise, each node can empty its own FIFO and in turn deliver a status signal to a neighboring node indicating that the local FIFO is empty.

40|$|The free-space optical (FSO) <b>communication</b> <b>links</b> with orbital angular {{momentum}} (OAM) multiplexing have been demonstrated that they can largely enhance the systems' capacity without a corresponding increase in spectral bandwidth, but {{the performance of the}} system is unavoidably disturbed by atmospheric turbulence (AT). Different from the existed AT disturbance, the OAM-multiplexed systems will cause both the burst and random errors for a single OAM state carrier and the `crosstalk' interference between the different OAM states carriers. In this paper, we propose a turbulence mitigation method to improve AT tolerance of OAM-multiplexed FSO <b>communication</b> <b>links.</b> In the proposed scheme, we use channel codes to correct the burst and random errors caused by AT for a single OAM state carrier; And we use wavefront correction method to correct the `crosstalk' interference between the different OAM states carriers. The improvements of AT tolerance are discussed by comparing the performance of OAM-multiplexed FSO <b>communication</b> <b>links</b> with or without channel coding or Shark-Hartmann wavefront correction method. The numerical simulation results show that the OAM-multiplexed FSO <b>communication</b> <b>links</b> have enhanced their AT tolerance.
