40|$|Ferruform AB in Luleå is a {{manufacturer}} of chassi components for Scania’s truck production. At the department for Axle production sheet metal is processed to produce rear axle housings. The main processes include shearing, forming, welding and machining. High amount of residual stresses are built up in the material because of the extensive weld operations. Residual stresses are reduced with a very time and energy consuming heat treatment method called <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> <b>relief.</b> The purpose with this thesis was to investigate alternative methods for <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> and then suggest the best solution for Ferruform. Our main tasks in this thesis has been literature studies, investigation of prior work, market analysis, contact and visits from suppliers, production tests and weekly meetings with our supervisor. Finally we have presented the thesis verbally at the company and at Luleå University of Technology. A written report has also been made. Two alternative methods for <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> has been found and further investigated. Tests have been made regarding these two methods for stress relief. One test with a method called vibratory stress relief and one test with a simulated bend-straightening operation. Layouts have been created to easier visualize the space required for the different methods. Seen from the layouts is that both methods requires less space than the <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> oven. Single piece flow is achieved with bend-straightening and batched flow is achieved with vibratory stress relief. Bend-straightening provides single batch flow, low cycle times and is utilized by a competitor, therefore it is recommended as a primary option to <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> at Ferruform. However, verification tests {{have to be made}} in order to evaluate the effects of the two different alternative methods. We have suggested that a fatigue test with spectrum loads should be carried out {{in order to get a}} reliable result. Also a third method is taken into account in this thesis, hot formed banjo halves. This is not an option for Ferruform but may be an alternative to Scania Sao Paolo in Brazil.

Each experiment consisted of a 1 -wk acclima-tion under thermoneutrality (TN) (Ta = Tw = 21 C), a 4 -wk heat exposure or treatment period, and a 2 -wk recovery under TN. Each experiment involved 24 individually caged hens at the initial age of 29 wk (Experiment 1) or 30 wk (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, Tw of 18 or 27 C was provided to 12 birds per Tw regimen under a diurnal Ta of 27 to 35 C (daily mean of 31 C).

The target thermal conditions in the animal occupied zone were achieved inside a wind tunnel [0 to 1. 5 m·s - 1 (0 to 300 ft·min - 1) ] that was situated inside an environment-controlled room and re-circulated the room air. Target air temperature [± 0. 2 ° C (± 0. 36 ° F) ] and RH (± 2 %) were achieved by controlling the auxiliary heaters and humidifiers in two stages via a programmable measurement and control module and its peripherals.

Yet, under conditions of climate warming, little is known regarding the ability of small-scale dairy producers to maintain production and/or the robustness of possible adaptation options in meeting the challenges presented, particularly heat stress. The authors created a simple, deterministic model to explore the influence of breed and <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> options on smallholder dairy farmers in Odisha, India. Breeds included indigenous Indian (non-descript), low-grade Jersey crossbreed and high-grade Jersey crossbreed. Relief strategies included providing shade, fanning and bathing. The impact of predicted critical global climate parameters, a 2 °C and 4 °C temperature rise were explored. A feed price scenario was modelled to illustrate the importance of feed in impact estimation. Feed costs were increased by 10 % to 30 %. Across the simulations, high-grade Jersey crossbreeds maintained higher milk yields, despite being the most sensitive to the negative effects of temperature. Low-capital relief strategies were the most effective at reducing heat stress impacts on household income. However, as feed costs increased the lower-grade Jersey crossbreed became the most profitable breed. The high-grade Jersey crossbreed was only marginally (4. 64 %) more profitable than the indigenous breed. The results demonstrate the importance of understanding the factors and practical trade-offs that underpin adaptation. The model also highlights the need for hot-climate dairying projects and programmes to consider animal genetic resources alongside environmentally sustainable adaptation measures for greatest poverty impact...|$|E

40|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognised}} that cities exhibit their own microclimate and are typically warmer than the surrounding rural areas. This effect known as the urban heat island (UHI) results from the inadvertent modification of surface properties that lead to greater absorption of solar radiation, reduced cooling from slower wind speeds, and lower water evaporation rates. Cities contain fewer green and blue-spaces than rural areas, with the existing under constant threat from increasing population densities. The reduced water evaporation rates in cities {{as a result of}} the loss of such features is considered a major fac-tor in increasing the magnitude of the UHI. This paper seeks to identify the fun-damental principles of how green and blue-space affect canopy-layer and boundary-layer temperatures in the mitigation of urban heat risks. To address this, the paper presents a review of current understanding from city-planning, urban climatology, and heat island and climate change studies. The findings highlight recent research that suggests the cooling influence of both features are mainly relevant for canopy-layer conditions, with green-space offering greater <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> when it is most needed. Any contribution to the cooling of the boundary-layer climate is attributed mainly to green-space increasing sur-face roughness that improves convection efficiency rather than evaporation, while little evidence exists for blue-space that support significant boundary-layer influence. This in turn has significant bearing on how these features should be used in future urban growth strategies that aim to deliver a reduced UHI and enhanced climate change resilience...|$|E
40|$|It {{has long}} been {{recognised}} that cities exhibit their own microclimate and are typically warmer than the surrounding rural areas. This ‘mesoscale’ influence {{is known as the}} urban heat island (UHI) effect and results largely from modification of surface properties leading to greater absorption of solar radiation, reduced convective cooling and lower water evaporation rates. Cities typically contain less vegetation and bodies of water than rural areas, and existing green and bluespace is often under threat from increasing population densities. This paper presents a meta-analysis of the key ways in which green and bluespace affect both urban canopy- and boundary-layer temperatures, examined from the perspectives of city-planning, urban climatology and climate science. The analysis suggests that the evapotranspiration-based cooling influence of both green and bluespace is primarily relevant for urban canopy-layer conditions, and that tree-dominated greenspace offers the greatest <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> when it is most needed. However, the magnitude and transport of cooling experienced depends on size, spread, and geometry of greenspaces, with some solitary large parks found to offer minimal boundary-layer cooling. Contribution to cooling at the scale of the urban boundary-layer climate is attributed mainly to greenspace increasing surface roughness and thereby improving convection efficiency rather than evaporation. Although bluespace cooling and transport during the day can be substantial, nocturnal warming is highlighted as likely when conditions are most oppressive. However, when both features are employed together they can offer many synergistic ecosystem benefits including cooling. The ways in which green and bluespace infrastructure is applied in future urban growth strategies, particularly in countries expected to experience rapid urbanisation, warrants greater consideration in urban planning policy to mitigate the adverse effects of the UHI and enhance climate resilience...|$|E
40|$|Most launch {{vehicles}} and satellites in the US inventory rely upon {{the use of}} hypergolic rocket propellants, {{many of which are}} toxic to humans. These fuels and oxidizers, such as hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide have threshold limit values as low as 0. 01 PPM. It is essential to provide space workers handling these agents whole body protection as they are universally hazardous not only to the respiratory system, but the skin as well. This paper describes a new method for powering a whole body protective garment to assure the safety of ground servicing crews. A new technology has been developed through the small business innovative research program at the Kennedy Space Center. Currently, liquid air is used in the environmental control unit (ECU) that powers the propellant handlers suit (PHE). However, liquid air exhibits problems with attitude dependence, oxygen enrichment, and difficulty with reliable quantity measurement. The new technology employs the storage of the supply air as a supercritical gas. This method of air storage overcomes all of three problems above while maintaining high density storage at relatively low vessel pressures (< 7000 kPa or approximately 1000 psi). A one hour prototype ECU was developed and tested to prove the feasibility of this concept. This was upgraded by the design of a larger supercritical dewar capable of holding 7 Kg of air, a supply which provides a 2 hour duration to the PHE. A third version is being developed to test the feasibility of replacing existing air cooling methodology with a liquid cooled garment for relief of heat stress in this warm Florida environment. Testing of the first one hour prototype yielded data comparable to the liquid air powered predecessor, but enjoyed advantages of attitude independence and oxygen level stability. Thermal data revealed <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> <b>relief</b> at least as good as liquid air supplied units. The application of supercritical air technology to this whole body protective ensemble marked an advancement in the state-of-the-art in personal protective equipment. Not only was long duration environmental control provided, but it was done without a high pressure vessel. The unit met human performance needs for attitude independence, oxygen stability and relief of heat stress. This supercritical air (and oxygen) technology is suggested for microgravity applications in life support such as the Extravehicular Mobility Unit. c 2001. Elsevier Science Ltd.

In {{the face of a}} warming climate and urbanization, which {{contributes}} to local-scale urban heat islands, it is very likely that extreme heat events (EHEs) will become more common and more severe in the U. S. In a NASA-funded project supporting the National Climate Assessment, we are providing historical and future measures of extreme heat to enable assessments of the impacts of heat on public health over the coterminous U. S. We use atmospheric temperature and humidity information from meteorological reanalysis and from Global Climate Models (GCMs) to provide data on past and future heat events. The project s emphasis is on providing assessments of the magnitude, frequency and geographic distribution of extreme heat in the U. S. to facilitate public health studies. In our approach, long-term climate change is captured with GCM output, and the temporal and spatial characteristics of short-term extremes are represented by the reanalysis data. Two future time horizons, 2040 and 2090, are the focus of future assessments; these are compared to the recent past period of 1981 - 2000. We are characterizing regional-scale temperature and humidity conditions using GCM output for two climate change scenarios (A 2 and A 1 B) defined in the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES). For each future period, 20 years of multi-model GCM output have been analyzed to develop a <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> climatology based on statistics of extreme heat indicators. Differences between the two future and past periods have been used to define temperature and humidity changes on a monthly time scale and regional spatial scale. These changes, combined with hourly historical meteorological data at a spatial scale (12 km) much finer than that of GCMs, enable us to create future climate realizations, from which we compute the daily <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> measures and related spatially-specific climatological fields. These include the mean annual number of days above certain thresholds of maximum and minimum air temperatures, heat indices and a new <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> variable that gives an integrated measure of <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> (and <b>relief)</b> {{over the course of a}} day. Comparisons are made between projected (2040 and 2090) and past (1990) <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> statistics. All output is being provided at the 12 km spatial scale and will also be aggregated to the county level, which is a popular scale of analysis for public health researchers. County-level statistics will be made available by our collaborators at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) via the Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) system.

However, the {{mechanism for the}} loss of plant resistance under <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> remains to be determined. In this study, we determined polar lipid profiles in control and Hessian fly-infested resistant and susceptible wheat seedlings with/without <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> using an automated electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. <b>Heat</b> <b>stress</b> alone or in combination with infestation, caused significant reductions in the content of total polar lipids and double bond index, and exerted greater impacts on lipid metabolism than <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> or infestation alone in Molly and Newton. The results suggest that changes in lipid metabolism caused by <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> may be part of the metabolic pathways through which <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> suppresses wheat plant resistance to Hessian fly infestation. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>stress</b> {{has been}} a subject of {{considerable}} concern among Arizona cotton growers due to a recent string of hot, humid summers. Research studies indicate <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> develops when mean crop temperature exceeds 82. 4 F (28 C). Serious <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> develops when mean crop temperatures exceed 86 E Several meteorological factors impact crop temperatures in Arizona; however, accurate estimates of crop temperature can be made using a model requiring air and dew point temperature. This model {{was used to evaluate}} <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> conditions in Arizona over the past 10 years. Results from this evaluation show the past three years were difficult years for <b>heat</b> <b>stress.</b> Elevation and humidity levels are major factors impacting <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> in any given year. Lower elevation areas are more prone to <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> than high elevation areas such as Safford. Possible management options to minimize the impact of <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> include early optimal planting dates, variety selection, field location and good water management...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine environmental parameters related to the <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> of broiler chickens. A total of 50 broiler flocks across 4 regions in Alberta were used to identify factors that contribute to <b>heat</b> <b>stress.</b> A <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> index was calculated {{as a function of the}} deviation of actual from target environmental temperature and bird age. Principal component analysis was performed to determine key characteristics relating <b>heat</b> <b>stress,</b> bird performance, and carcass quality. Key relationships that emerged included an improvement in carcass quality and broiler microclimate with misting. Even when the <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> index was not severe, misting reduced condemnations at the processing plant and total mortality. In the southern region, high ventilation rates did not reduce heat stress; only misting was effective. When <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> is low, broilers can be grown at stocking densities> 35 kg/m 2 without compromising carcass quality. Key words: <b>heat</b> <b>stress,</b> <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> index, broiler performance, temperature, principal component analysi...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants {{exposed to}} higher than usual {{temperatures}} during ripening show altered agronomic and grain quality characteristics. Given that seasonal variation in quality creates {{difficulties in the}} marketing and processing of grain, improving the genetic adaptation of wheat cultivars to <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> is an important objective in breeding programs. Some genotypes {{have been reported to}} have a thermo tolerant response and could be used as genetic sources for heat tolerance. Six spring wheat cultivars and four elite experimental lines were evaluated in Uruguay. Two field experiments were conducted in years 2001 and 2002 to determine response under natural <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> conditions, and two greenhouse experiments were conducted to vary duration and timing of <b>heat</b> <b>stress.</b> Grain protein concentration increased with moderate (field conditions) and high <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> (controlled environment). <b>Heat</b> <b>stress</b> imposed early in grain fill had the greater effect. In field conditions, moderate to high <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> at mid-grain fill increased test weight and thousand kernel weight. Higher <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> under controlled environment caused a decrease in thousand kernel weight, without any difference in relation to duration or timing of stress. Rheological properties were affected by <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> in field conditions. While moderate <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> throughout grain fill caused stronger dough, moderate to high <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> at mid-grain fill produced weaker dough. These results suggest a curvilinear response to increasing <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> for both thousand kernel weight and rheological properties. Impact of <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> under field conditions was inconsistent on protein molecular weight distribution. Moderate to high <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> at mid-grain fill lowered level of monomeric proteins, and increased the ratio soluble polymeric proteins/monomeric proteins. Moderate <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> throughout grain fill decreased percentage of soluble polymeric proteins, and increased percentage of low molecular weight albumins and globulins. No effect of <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> was detected on protein molecular weight distribution in controlled environment. However, with longer duration of stress, significant genotype x treatment interaction was detected. Cultivars with relatively stable agronomic and quality characteristics were identified and could be used as genetic sources for improving resistance to <b>heat</b> <b>stress...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> on {{reproduction}} {{is a complex}} interaction of all systems in the animal body. Because the granulosa cells are the main source {{for one of the}} main hormones (progesterone) involved in reproduction, this series of studies was focused on the effect of <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> on: (1) the ability of granulosa cells to produce progesterone; (2) The involvement of other mediators from other systems in progesterone production under heat stress; (3) Morphology of granulosa cells; (4) The ability of granulosa cells from <b>heat</b> <b>stressed</b> hens to recover over time. Study 1 was conducted to examine the effect of <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> and cytokine interleukin- 1 on the ability of granulosa cells to secrete progesterone. It was found that both <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> and interleukin- 1 significantly reduce the amount of progesterone secreted by chicken granulosa cells. In study 2, the effect of <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> and interleukin- 1 on 3 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 β-HSD), a key enzyme in progesterone synthesis, was determined. A significant reduction in 3 β-HSD activity in response to <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> and interleukin- 1 was observed. Study 3 was conducted to examine the effect of <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> on granulosa cells morphology, found in earlier studies to be altered. The area covered by lipid droplets in <b>heat</b> <b>stressed</b> hens granulosa cells was significantly greater than that in granulosa cells of thermoneutral hens. In study 4, granulosa cells from <b>heat</b> <b>stressed</b> hens were examined for their ability to recover over time. It was found that these cells have the ability to regain their activity and normal morphology over time, a finding that appears to parallel the systemic return of circulating hormone concentrations during acclimatization long-term <b>heat</b> <b>stress.</b> ^ We conclude that both <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> and interleukin- 1 have the ability to reduce the production of progesterone by granulosa cells, perhaps by reducing 3 β-HSD activity. In addition, <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> alters granulosa cells morphology. However, the effects of <b>heat</b> <b>stress</b> on granulosa cells in terms of enzyme activity, steroidogenesis, and morphology return to near normal over time. ...|$|R
