5|$|Covered {{interest}} rate parity is a no-arbitrage condition in foreign exchange markets which {{depends on the}} availability of the forward market. It can be rearranged to give the forward <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> {{as a function of the}} other variables. The forward <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> depends on three known variables: the spot <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> the domestic {{interest rate}}, and the foreign interest rate. This effectively means that the forward rate is the price of a forward contract, which derives its value from the pricing of spot contracts and the addition of information on available interest rates.|$|E

5|$|When the no-arbitrage {{condition}} is {{satisfied with the}} use of a forward contract to hedge against exposure to <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> risk, interest rate parity is said to be covered. Investors will still be indifferent among the available interest rates in two countries because the forward <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> sustains equilibrium such that the dollar return on dollar deposits is equal to the dollar return on foreign deposit, thereby eliminating the potential for covered interest arbitrage profits. Furthermore, covered interest rate parity helps explain the determination of the forward <b>exchange</b> <b>rate.</b> The following equation represents covered interest rate parity.|$|E
5|$|Following the Smithsonian Agreement, {{member states}} of the European Economic Community adopted a {{narrower}} currency band of 1.125% for exchange rates among their own currencies, creating a smaller scale fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> system known as the snake in the tunnel. The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies. In 1979, the European Monetary System (EMS) phased out the currency snake. The EMS featured two key components: the European Currency Unit (ECU), an artificial weighted average market basket of European Union members' currencies, and the <b>Exchange</b> <b>Rate</b> Mechanism (ERM), a procedure for managing <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> fluctuations in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies' par values. The parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system, denominated in terms of ECUs. The weights within the ECU changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket. Under the ERM, if an <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> reached its upper or lower limit (within a 2.25% band), both nations in that currency pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> to its par value according to the parity matrix. The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the Bretton Woods system. Similarly to Bretton Woods however, EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for exchange rates approaching their bounds, as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU's value. The central exchange rates of the parity grid could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances, and were modified every eight months on average during the systems' initial four years of operation. During its twenty-year lifespan, these central rates were adjusted over 50 times.|$|E

40|$|This article investigates Granger {{causality}} between <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> {{and prices}} for the US and four of its trading partners: Canada, Germany, Japan and the UK. We emphasize the distinction between direct and indirect Granger causality: <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> directly cause prices if movements in <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> lead movement in prices, and <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> indirectly cause prices if deviations from the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) condition can help forecast movement in prices. But only by including the interest-rate differential in our error correction model do we obtain results that align with economic theory. The economic theory of PPP suggests that <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> and prices are cointegrated, with <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> moving proportionally to prices in the long run. In general, we find either direct or indirect feedback mechanisms between <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> and prices. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{absence of}} {{distinct}} currencies also theoretically removes <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> risks, although {{the imposition of}} transfer restrictions in 2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis means {{that the situation is}} not quite so simple. The risk of unanticipated <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> movement has always added an additional risk or uncertainty for companies or individuals that invest or trade outside their own currency zones. Companies that hedge against this risk will no longer need to shoulder this additional cost. This is particularly important for countries whose currencies had traditionally fluctuated a great deal, particularly the Mediterranean nations.|$|E
5|$|The forward <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> (also {{referred}} to as forward rate or forward price) is the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> at which a bank agrees to exchange one currency for another at a future date when it enters into a forward contract with an investor. Multinational corporations, banks, and other financial institutions enter into forward contracts {{to take advantage of}} the forward rate for hedging purposes. The forward <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> is determined by a parity relationship among the spot <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> and differences in interest rates between two countries, which reflects an economic equilibrium in the foreign exchange market under which arbitrage opportunities are eliminated. When in equilibrium, and when interest rates vary across two countries, the parity condition implies that the forward rate includes a premium or discount reflecting the interest rate differential. Forward exchange rates have important theoretical implications for forecasting future spot exchange rates. Financial economists have put forth a hypothesis that the forward rate accurately predicts the future spot rate, for which empirical evidence is mixed.|$|E
5|$|The forward <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> is {{the rate}} at which a {{commercial}} bank is willing to commit to exchange one currency for another at some specified future date. The forward <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> is a type of forward price. It is the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> negotiated today between a bank and a client upon entering into a forward contract agreeing to buy or sell some amount of foreign currency in the future. Multinational corporations and financial institutions often use the forward market to hedge future payables or receivables denominated in a foreign currency against foreign exchange risk by using a forward contract to lock in a forward <b>exchange</b> <b>rate.</b> Hedging with forward contracts is typically used for larger transactions, while futures contracts are used for smaller transactions. This is due to the customization afforded to banks by forward contracts traded over-the-counter, versus the standardization of futures contracts which are traded on an exchange. Banks typically quote forward rates for major currencies in maturities of one, three, six, nine, or twelve months, however in some cases quotations for greater maturities are available up to five or ten years.|$|E

Tests of UIRP for economies experiencing institutional regime changes, using monthly <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> data for the US dollar versus the Deutsche mark and the Spanish peseta versus the British pound, have found some evidence that UIRP held when US and German regime changes were volatile, and held between Spain and the United Kingdom particularly after Spain joined the European Union in 1986 and began liberalizing capital mobility.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> {{stability}} {{sustained by}} the Bretton Woods system facilitated expanding international trade, this early success masked its underlying design flaw, wherein there existed no mechanism for increasing the supply of international reserves to support continued growth in trade. The system began experiencing insurmountable market pressures and deteriorating cohesion among its key participants in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Central banks needed more U.S. dollars to hold as reserves, but were unable to expand their money supplies if doing so meant exceeding their dollar reserves and threatening their <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> pegs. To accommodate these needs, the Bretton Woods system depended on the United States to run dollar deficits. As a consequence, the dollar's value began exceeding its gold backing. During the early 1960s, investors could sell gold for a greater dollar <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> in London than in the United States, signaling to market participants that the dollar was overvalued. Belgian-American economist Robert Triffin defined this problem {{now known as the}} Triffin dilemma, in which a country's national economic interests conflict with its international objectives as the custodian of the world's reserve currency.|$|E

Although the fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> meant that Americans were heavily funding the South Vietnamese economy and that the importing firms could obtain more goods for their money, the rate also meant that South Vietnam goods would not be economically competitive on the export market.
