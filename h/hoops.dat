5|$|In {{the early}} 18th century several duck decoys were {{built on the}} moor. These {{consisted}} of {{a pool of water}} leading from which are from one to eight curving, tapering ditches. Over each ditch is a series of <b>hoops,</b> initially made from wood, later from iron, which diminish in size as the ditch tapers. The <b>hoops</b> are covered in netting. The combination of ditch and net-covered <b>hoops</b> is known as a pipe.|$|E
5|$|East Stirlingshire's home colours {{have been}} {{black and white}} <b>hoops</b> {{for most of its}} {{existence}} since 1882. The club's first strip was thin blue and white <b>hoops</b> between 1880 and 1882, before changing to colours similar to the present day. An all-black shirt was introduced between 1960 and 1962, and again between 2008 and 2010, while the club's centenary strip in 1981 was all-white. In 1996–97, the stripes were changed from horizontal to vertical for a full season; a similar design featured for one month in August 1982 before changing back.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, Darlington's kit {{consisted}} of a shirt with black and white vertical stripes, black shorts and black socks. Apart from a period between the 1910s and 1936, when blue shorts were worn, the basic colours of the home kit have remained black and white. The shirt design has varied, from the 1888 vertical stripes, through <b>hoops,</b> plain white, and back to <b>hoops</b> again in the 1990s. Sponsors' names have appeared on Darlington's shirts since the 1980s. A table of kit manufacturers (since the 1970s) and shirt sponsors appears on the right.|$|E

25|$|In {{its modern}} {{incarnation}} {{as an art}} or dance form, and form of exercise, the practice of manipulating a <b>hoop</b> is referred to either as <b>hoop</b> dance or simply <b>hooping.</b> <b>Hoop</b> dance artists commonly refer to themselves, and the greater <b>hoop</b> dance community, as hoopers.|$|R
50|$|Modern <b>hooping</b> {{has created}} {{a wide range of}} tricks. <b>Hooping</b> now {{includes}} many 'on body' moves and many 'off body' moves. A few examples include breaks, isolations, leg <b>hooping,</b> and double <b>hooping.</b>|$|R
5|$|The club {{eventually}} {{chose the}} colours {{of the local}} Parramatta council, which were royal blue and gold, which were represented on their jersey in horizontal stripes, or <b>hoops.</b> The crest used these colours and was {{like many of the}} other crests of the 1908 season, a badge with a letter 'C', to represent the first letter of Cumberland. The badge was royal blue, while the letter gold. These colours were later used by the Parramatta Eels at their introduction in the NSWRL premiership in 1947, although there was no official affiliation between Cumberland and the later Parramatta team. The club's jersey was, like most other clubs, the colours in <b>hoops</b> around the jersey. These <b>hoops</b> of blue and gold were mixed with a white collar and black or grey shorts.|$|E

5|$|The {{crinoline}} {{needed to}} be rigid enough to support the skirts in their accustomed shape, but also flexible enough to be temporarily pressed out of shape and spring back afterwards. Other materials used for crinolines included whalebone, gutta-percha and vulcanised caoutchouc (natural rubber). The idea of inflatable <b>hoops</b> was short-lived as they were easily punctured, prone to collapse, and due {{to the use of}} brimstone in the manufacture of rubber, they smelled unpleasant. Although hard rubber <b>hoops</b> of gutta-percha worked satisfactorily at first, they were brittle and easily crushed without recovering their form. Despite objections that the sharp points of snapped steels were hazardous, lightweight steel was clearly the most successful option. It reduced the number of petticoats and their weight, and offered increased freedom of movement of the legs. However, hasty or careless movements in a hoop skirt could lead to accidentally revealing more than intended. An advertisement published in The Lady's Newspaper in 1863 for a cage crinoline with waved <b>hoops</b> attempted to reassure the potential customer that while wearing it, activities such as climbing stairs, passing to her theatre seat, dropping into armchairs and leaning against furniture would be possible without hindrance either to herself or to others around her.|$|E

50|$|Mastering aiming and {{catching}} {{can be very}} time consuming. To throw the <b>hoop,</b> one takes the <b>hoop</b> and, with one rod in each hand, places the <b>hoop</b> over both of the rods so as they are inside of the <b>hoop.</b> The player would then let the <b>hoop</b> slide slightly down the rod and cross the rods in an X shape. Ideally, the <b>hoop</b> {{should be on the}} lower triangle of the X shape. Then, pulling the rods apart, the <b>hoop</b> will quickly slide up and shoot away from the player, towards the direction aimed for.|$|R

5|$|Until 1926, Shamrock Rovers wore {{green and}} white striped jerseys but {{following}} a suggestion by a committee member, John Sheridan, the club chose to adopt the {{green and white}} hooped strip. A close relationship existed between the club and Belfast Celtic {{and it was on}} account of this that the idea was formed. The first game featuring the new jerseys was against Bray Unknowns in a FAI Cup match on 9 January 1927 at Shelbourne Park. The <b>Hoops</b> lost the game 3–0 and senior members of the club considered abandoning the new strip. Despite this loss, the team continued to wear green and white <b>hoops</b> and have done ever since. The 2007 season was the first season since the <b>hoops</b> were introduced that they were not continuous around {{the main body of the}} jersey. The style of the shirt sleeves has been changed on numerous occasions. The away colours of the club have varied over time. In the early 1980s, the club had a yellow away jersey. In the mid-1990s, a hooped purple jersey was adopted. In 2011, the team wore an all black away strip.|$|E

5|$|The {{crinoline}} {{was perceived}} as a signifier of social identity, with a popular subject for cartoons being that of maids wearing crinolines like their mistresses, much to the higher-class ladies' disapproval. The questions of servants in crinoline and the related social concerns were raised by George Routledge in an etiquette manual published in 1875, where he criticised London housemaids for wearing <b>hoops</b> at work. As the girls knelt to scrub the doorsteps, Routledge described how their <b>hoops</b> rose to expose their lower bodies, inspiring street harassment from errand boys and other male passers-by. Routledge firmly opined that servants ought to save their fashionable garments for their leisure periods, and dress appropriately for their work. However, this was challenged by some servants who saw attempts to control their dress as equivalent to controlling their liberty, and refused to work for employers who tried to forbid crinolines.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hoop</b> rolling, {{also called}} <b>hoop</b> trundling, {{is both a}} sport and a child's game in which a large <b>hoop</b> is rolled along the ground, {{generally}} {{by means of an}} object wielded by the player.

50|$|The hula <b>hoop</b> craze {{swept the}} world, dying out {{again in the}} 1980s, but not in China and Russia, where hula <b>hooping</b> and <b>hoop</b> {{manipulation}} were adopted by traditional circuses and rhythmic gymnasts.|$|R
5|$|Athenian {{girls were}} not {{formally}} educated; instead, their mothers taught them the domestic {{skills necessary for}} running a household. Formal education for boys consisted of rhetoric, necessary for effective political participation, and physical education in preparation for military service. These skills were not considered necessary for women, who were barred from learning them. Classical art indicates that girls and boys played with toys such as spinning tops, <b>hoops,</b> and seesaws, and played games such as piggyback. The gravestone of Plangon, an Athenian girl aged about five {{which is in the}} Glyptothek museum in Munich, shows her holding a doll; a set of knucklebones hangs on a wall in the background.|$|E
5|$|Bradford City {{became the}} first league {{football}} team from the county, before they even had a team or played a game.

A summer archery contest, which had been organised {{to raise money for the}} rugby league club, was used to finance the new club, and Manningham's colours of claret and amber were adopted as Bradford City's kit, but with Manningham's <b>hoops</b> changed to stripes.|$|E
5|$|Chapman also {{advocated}} {{the use of}} white footballs and numbered shirts, as well as adding <b>hoops</b> to Arsenal's socks {{to make it easier}} for players to pick each other out. He later made a further change to Arsenal's kit, adding white sleeves to the previously all-red shirt and brightening the colour, before a match against Liverpool on 4 March 1933; the same kit theme of red with white sleeves or trim survives to this day. The tradition of both teams walking out together at the FA Cup Final was started in 1930 due to Herbert Chapman's involvement with both clubs, and has continued since.|$|E

Alongside fire, other hazards included the <b>hoops</b> being caught in machinery, carriage wheels, gusts of wind, or other obstacles.|$|E
