5|$|Like {{the other}} group 8 elements, {{ruthenium}} and osmium, iron exists {{in a wide range}} of oxidation states, −2 to +7, although +2 and +3 are the most common. Elemental iron occurs in meteoroids and other low oxygen environments, but is reactive to oxygen and water. Fresh iron surfaces appear lustrous silvery-gray, but oxidize in normal air to give hydrated <b>iron</b> <b>oxides,</b> commonly known as rust. Unlike the metals that form passivating oxide layers, <b>iron</b> <b>oxides</b> occupy more volume than the metal and thus flake off, exposing fresh surfaces for corrosion.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} rock {{constituents}} of the crust are nearly all oxides: chlorine, sulfur, and fluorine are the important {{exceptions to this}} and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1%. Over 99% of the crust is composed of 11 oxides, principally silica, alumina, <b>iron</b> <b>oxides,</b> lime, magnesia, potash, and soda.|$|E
5|$|All {{of these}} {{temperatures}} {{could be reached}} with ancient methods used since the Bronze Age. Since the oxidation rate of iron increases rapidly beyond , {{it is important that}} smelting take place in a low-oxygen environment. Smelting, using carbon to reduce <b>iron</b> <b>oxides,</b> results in an alloy (pig iron) that retains too much carbon to be called steel. The excess carbon and other impurities are removed in a subsequent step.|$|E

5|$|Uranium and osmium were early {{successful}} catalysts in the Haber process, {{the nitrogen}} fixation reaction of nitrogen and hydrogen to produce ammonia, giving enough yield {{to make the}} process economically successful. At the time, a group at BASF led by Carl Bosch bought most of the world's supply of osmium {{to use as a}} catalyst. Shortly thereafter, in 1908, cheaper catalysts based on iron and <b>iron</b> <b>oxides</b> were introduced by the same group for the first pilot plants, removing the need for the expensive and rare osmium.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} other Black Paintings, Goya began with a black {{background}} which he painted over with lighter pigments, then with broad, heavy brushstrokes of grey, blue and brown. The darker areas were achieved by leaving the black under-paint exposed; this is most obvious in {{the figure of the}} Devil. Like the other works in the series, Witches' Sabbath is worked up through heavy, slashing brushstrokes. The plaster was underlaid with thick carbon black before the paint was applied in hues of white lead, Prussian blue, vermilion of mercury, and crystals of powdered glass, orpiment and <b>iron</b> <b>oxides.</b> He likely worked with mixed materials. Technical analysis indicates that most of the Black Paintings begun with preparatory drawings. Witches' Sabbath is the exception; the final composition seems to have been painted directly onto the wall.|$|E
30|$|In {{regard to}} their {{hydrodynamic}} diameter, <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles can be classified into superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> (SPIO) (60 to 250 nm), ultra small paramagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> (USPIO) (5 to 40 nm), and micrometer-sized particles of <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> (MPIO) (0.9 to 8 μm). USPIO can be further chemically modified, termed cross-linked <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles (CLIO), in order to attach new molecules for targeting purposes [56 – 58]. Several studies have been reported using CLIO for the active targeting of various diseases, including cancer and atherosclerosis [59 – 64].|$|R

Thus, <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> (Fe 3 O 4) nanoparticles {{were incorporated}} into a biodegradable polymer (poly-L-lactic acid, PLLA) to fabricate a composite bone screw. This multifunctional, 3 D printable bone screw was detectable on X-ray examination. In this study, mechanical tests including three-point bending and ultimate tensile strength were conducted to evaluate the optimal ratio of <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles in the PLLA composite. Both injection molding and 3 D printing techniques were used to fabricate the PLLA bone screws with and without the <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles. The fabricated screws were implanted into the femoral condyles of New Zealand White rabbits. Bone blocks containing the PLLA screws were resected 2 and 4 weeks after surgery. Histologic examination of the surrounding bone and the radiopacity of the iron-oxide-containing PLLA screws were evaluated. Our results indicated that addition of <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles at 30 % significantly decreased the ultimate tensile stress properties of the PLLA screws. The screws with 20 % <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> exhibited strong radiopacity compared to the screws fabricated without the <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles. Four weeks after surgery, the average bone volume of the <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> PLLA composite screws was significantly {{greater than that of}} PLLA screws without <b>iron</b> <b>oxide.</b> These findings suggested that biodegradable and X-ray detectable PLLA bone screws can be produced by incorporation of 20 % <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of the labeling of umbilical cord vein derived mesenchymal stem cells with superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles coated with dextran and complexed to a non-viral transfector agent transfector poly-L-lysine. METHODS: The labeling of mesenchymal stem cells was performed using the superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran complexed and not complexed to poly-L-lysine. Superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran was incubated with poly-L-lysine in an ultrasonic sonicator at 37 °C for 10 minutes for complex formation superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine by electrostatic interaction. Then, the mesenchymal stem cells were incubated overnight with the complex superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine and superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran. After the incubation period the mesenchymal stem cells were evaluated by internalization of the complex superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine and superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran by Prussian Blue stain. Cellular viability of labeled mesenchymal stem cells was evaluated by cellular proliferation assay using 5, 6 -carboxy-fluorescein-succinimidyl ester method and apoptosis detection by Annexin V- Propidium Iodide assay. RESULTS: mesenchymal stem cells labeled with superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran without poly-L-lysine not internalized efficiently the superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles due to its low presence detected within cells. Mesenchymal stem cells labeled with the complex superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine efficiently internalized the superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles due to greater presence in the cells interior. The viability and apoptosis assays demonstrated that the mesenchymal stem cells labeled and not labeled respectively with the superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran/poly-L-lysine continue to proliferate over seven days and the percentage of cells in early or late apoptosis is low compared to the percentage of live cells over the three days. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that the use of poly-L-lysine complexed with superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles/dextran provides better internalization of these superparamagnetic <b>iron</b> <b>oxide</b> nanoparticles in mesenchymal stem cells Thus, we demonstrated that this type of labeling is not cytotoxic to the mesenchymal stem cells, since the viability and apoptosis assays showed that the cells remain alive and proliferating. The efficiency of this type of labeling in mesenchymal stem cells can provide non-invasive methods for monitoring these cells in vivo...|$|R
5|$|Several {{minerals}} {{used for}} paint pigments were excavated from Chetro Ketl, including charcoal, shale, malachite, <b>iron</b> <b>oxides,</b> hematite, limonite, gypsum, and azurite. Twined sandals, and bones from the ferruginous hawk {{and the great}} horned owl have been found there. The relative lack of exotic material uncovered at Chetro Ketl, such as shells, copper bells, and macaw feathers, may indicate its lesser importance compared to Pueblo Bonito, where those items {{have been found in}} abundance. Because Chetro Ketl has only been partially excavated definitive conclusions remain elusive. In 1937, W. W.

25|$|The natural arsenic {{pollution}} {{occurs because}} aquifer sediments contain organic matter that generates anaerobic {{conditions in the}} aquifer. These conditions result in the microbial dissolution of <b>iron</b> <b>oxides</b> in the sediment and, thus, {{the release of the}} arsenic, normally strongly bound to <b>iron</b> <b>oxides,</b> into the water. As a consequence, arsenic-rich groundwater is often iron-rich, although secondary processes often obscure the association of dissolved arsenic and dissolved iron.. Arsenic is found in groundwater most commonly as the reduced species arsenite and the oxidized species arsenate, being the acute toxicity of arsenite somewhat greater than that of arsenate.
