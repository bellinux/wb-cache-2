Besides its primary usage, DORIS image-map and the laser scanner digital elevation model provide a complete spatial base layer in a GIS system and can virtually serve all mapping applications requiring very high resolution and accurate three dimension spatial information.

It also offered much better resistance to corrosion in rural environments. At certain places, galvanized iron proved to be more durable than aluminium. The results obeyed well with the empirical kinetics equation of the form C = Ktn, where K and C are the corrosion losses in lm after 1 and ‘t’ years of the exposure, respectively, and ‘n’ is a constant.

In a cohort study of Swiss railway personnel with 2. 7 × 105 person-years of follow-up (1972 – 1993), the authors compared occupations with high average exposures (line engineers: 25. 9 µT) to those with medium and low <b>exposures</b> (<b>station</b> masters: 1 µT). The mortality rate ratio for leukemia was 2. 4 (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 0, 6. 1) among line engineers (reference category: station masters). The mortality rate ratio for brain tumors was 1. 0 (95 % CI: 0. 2, 4. 6) among line engineers and 5. 1 (95 % CI: 1. 2, 21. 2) among shunting yard engineers (compared with <b>station</b> masters). Two <b>exposure</b> characteristics were evaluated: cumulative exposure in µT-years and years spent under exposure to magnetic fields of ≥ 10 µT. There was {{a significant increase in}} leukemia mortality of 0. 9 % (95 % CI: 0. 2, 1. 7) per µT-year of cumulative exposure to extremely low frequency magnetic fields. The increase by years spent under exposure of ≥ 10 µT was even stronger: 62 % per year (95 % CI: 15, 129). Brain cancer risk did not show a dose-response relation. This study contributes to the evidence for a link between heavy exposure to extremely low frequency magnetic fields and leukemia.

40|$|Orbital stereo data is {{acquired}} by covering same area from two <b>exposure</b> <b>stations</b> in space with oblique viewing capability. It {{is used for}} generating digital elevation models (DEM) and three dimensional viewing of the terrain in a softcopy photogrammetric workstation. A good base to height ratio (B/H), usually greater than 0. 5, is necessary for generation of good quality absolute DEM. Processing of the data requires a few GCPs, image matching and interpolation. Therefore DEM accuracy also depends on these factors. Good image matching {{is one of the}} most important factors in governing the altitude accuracy. Two IRS 1 C/ 1 D PAN stereo pairs covering the part of Kachchh sedimentary basin were processed for extraction of DEM and its analysis for geological study. The DEM image in the first pair clearly shows the drainage, the topographic high and variation of elevation in the hilly part of the terrain. The topographic high (water divide) with brighter tone on gray scale image indicates a higher elevation than adjoining terrain. The large difference in solar elevation angles of the images of second pair results in difference in radiometry and finally resulting in difference in image matching hence a poor DEM is obtained. A height accuracy of 5 - 15 m is obtained in first case whereas in second case due to large plannimetric errors a height evaluation has not been attempted. Though Cartosat- 1 satellite, a dedicated Indian mission for along track stereo acquisition and DEM generation, is already in orbit, however experience gained from using across track PAN data from Indian Remote Sensing satellites IRS 1 C and 1 D, is highlighted here...|$|R

In this paper, an investigation is made into the inclusion of GPS pseudoranges directly into a photogrammetric bundle adjustment. The advantages of the technique include improved accuracy and reliability, {{and the ability to}} use GPS data when less than four satellites are available. Notes are made regarding pseudorange errors and their mitigation using atmospheric models, linear-combinations, and precise orbits and clock corrections. Using the new technique, tests are performed with aerial GPS/photogrammetric data that demonstrate that the method provides accuracies that are superior to those obtained when <b>exposure</b> <b>station</b> position observations are used in the adjustment.

40|$|Kinematic GPS based {{airborne}} geo-referencing {{systems have}} been widely used in aerial photogrammetry for more than a decade. Whilst the pseudo-range based GPS positioning is utilized for real time navigation during aerial image acquisition, the carrier phase based precise GPS positioning is applied for the camera <b>exposure</b> <b>station</b> location in a post-processing mode. However, rigorous requirements of positioning accuracy, availability and integrity cannot be achieved yet for some applications, such as large scale photogrammetry and aircraft landing. This challenging issue can be handled by integrating GPS with some other suitable technologies, such as pseudolite (PL) and/or Inertial Navigation System (INS). Pseudolites are transmitters that broadcast GPS signals. Ground-based pseudolites can strengthen the measurement geometry for airborne GPS based geo-referencing systems. As a result, positioning accuracy and reliability can be improved, especially in the vertical component. Pseudolite signals can also support integer ambiguity resolution, which is the key for carrier phase based precise positioning. As pseudolites are comparatively close to the user receivers, some challenging issues in systematic error analyses and modeling need to b...|$|E

Printing-based quantitative aberration measurements provide a convenient mechanism for the characterization of the optic wavefront error in the actual lithography tool. We present the lithographic measurement of low-order aberrations in the Berkeley MET tool, including a quantitative measurement of astigmatism and spherical error and a qualitative measurement of coma. The lithographic results are directly compared to interferometry results obtained from the same optic. Measurements of the Berkeley MET indicate either an alignment drift or errors in the interferometry on the order of 0. 5 to 1 nm...|$|E

40|$|While {{interferometry}} {{is routinely}} {{used for the}} characterization and alignment of lithographic optics, the ultimate performance metric for these optics is printing in photoresist. Direct comparison of imaging and wavefront performance is also useful for verifying and improving the predictive power of wavefront metrology under actual printing conditions. To address these issues, static, small-field printing capabilities are being added to the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) phase-shifting point diffraction interferometer (PS/PDI) implemented at the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. This Sub-field <b>Exposure</b> <b>Station</b> (SES) will enable the earliest possible imaging characterization of the upcoming Engineering Test Stand (ETS) Set- 2 projection optics. Relevant printing studies with the ETS projection optics require illumination partial coherence with {sigma} of approximately 0. 7.

Adding printing capabilities to the PS/PDI experimental system thus necessitates the development of an alternative illumination system capable of destroying the inherent coherence of the beamline. The SES is being implemented with two independent illuminators: the first is based on a novel EUV diffuser currently under development and the second is based on a scanning mirror design. Here we describe the design and implementation of the new SES, including a discussion of the illuminators and the fabrication of the EUV diffuser...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) {{technology}} has attracted attention for aerial photogrammetric mapping.

Using GNSS/INS technologies the images are taken at the planned position of the <b>exposure</b> <b>station</b> and the exterior orientation parameters (position Xo, Yo, Zo and attitude ω, φ, χ) of images can be direct determined. However, common UAVs (off-the-shelf) do not replace the traditional aircraft platform.
