5|$|McKay initiates an anti-Replicator {{field to}} protect them from the Asurans, but Oberoth (David Ogden Stiers) discovers this and sends a wave to {{override}} the field. Weir leaves McKay, confronts Oberoth and uses his power to freeze all the Asurans, even tricking him into believing that he has captured the team, all to buy Sheppard enough time to upload the programme. However, Weir struggles to keep Asurans frozen, and when Sheppard finds her just as she loses control, she orders him to leave <b>her</b> <b>behind</b> as the Asurans unfreeze and capture her. The team escapes without Weir, but end up trapped as they lack the power to make it to hyperspace. They are unexpectedly assisted by the Apollo, who have found Atlantis with Colonel Carter's (Amanda Tapping) help. The Apollo lays down covering fire long enough for the team to land in the fighter bay and carries them back to Atlantis. However, the Apollo is unable to lock onto Doctor Weir and beam her aboard. Now fully powered, Sheppard sends the city to M35-117, a back-up planet, and makes a rough landing onto its ocean. Whilst the team mourns the loss of Weir, McKay regains contact with Stargate Command. Dr. Zelenka (David Nykl) announces that the Asurans have begun their attack against the Wraith, meaning Weir's sacrifice was not in vain. Carter tells Sheppard that they will miss Weir, though Sheppard vows to find her again.|$|E

Riley convinces Cholo to allow him escape North and to join him, but the latter decides to return to Fiddler's Green to deal with Kaufman; his partner, Foxy (Tony Nappo) accompanies him. While en route, Cholo is bitten by a zombie and leaves to kill Kaufman by himself. Riley takes over Dead Reckoning once again and returns to Fiddler's Green.|$|E
25|$|Different cover artwork {{was created}} by Soejima for the 360 and PS3 versionsthe PS3 cover showed Catherine showing off her cleavage, while the 360 cover had Katherine lying on her front showing <b>her</b> <b>behind.</b> Soejima was {{originally}} told by Hashino to create covers that would catch people's eyes in stores; the different cover arts for different versions was chosen as they felt it would be interesting. The two characters were originally {{going to be in}} identical, near-naked poses. This was changed due to the character's different charms, which it was felt would be lost if they were posed in such a way. Soejima went through multiple cover designs, with one being the two characters holding different cutlery utensils. Hashino had little involvement beyond his initial instruction, but did ask that more of Katherine's back be shown in the image. The covers exemplified each character's contrasting appeal: Catherine's cleavage showed off her youthful beauty, while displaying Katherine's behind was meant to evoke her more motherly charms. This artwork was used for retail posters, but Atlus also created alternate artwork for stores that wanted something less risque.|$|E
25|$|Born in Nijmegen, Kooij {{made her}} ODI debut aged 21, {{appearing}} in three matches at the 1999 {{edition of the}} European Championship in Denmark. She scored a duck on debut against England, and also performed poorly in her two other matches, scoring five runs against Ireland and three against Denmark. Kooij did not play another international until 2003, when she was selected in the Dutch squad for the 2003 IWCC Trophy (the qualifier for the 2005 World Cup). At that tournament, she scored 115 runs from her four matches, placing <b>her</b> <b>behind</b> only Pauline te Beest and Carolien Salomons both for the Netherlands and for overall runs. Kooij's best innings, 78 from 138 balls, came in the opening match against Scotland, where she opened the batting with Eugenie van Leeuwen. Her innings included a 224-run stand with Pauline te Beest, which set a new record for the highest second-wicket partnership in ODIs (broken in 2009), {{and at the time}} was also the third-highest partnership overall (for any wicket). The IWCC Trophy was Kooij's final tournament for the Netherlands, with her last ODI coming in the final match, against Pakistan.|$|E
