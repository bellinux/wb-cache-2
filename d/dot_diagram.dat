40|$|Abstract The {{most common}} semiquantitative method of {{evaluation}} of pulmonary lesions using 18 F-FDG PET is FDG standardized uptake value (SUV). An SUV cutoff of 2. 5 or greater {{has been used}} to differentiate between benign and malignant nodules. The goal of our study was to investigate the correlation between the size of pulmonary nodules and the SUV for benign as well as for malignant nodules. Methods Retrospectively, 173 patients were selected from 420 referrals for evaluation of pulmonary lesions. All patients selected had a positive CT and PET scans and histopathology biopsy. A linear regression equation was fitted to a scatter plot of size and SUV max for malignant and benign nodules together. A <b>dot</b> <b>diagram</b> was created to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy using an SUV max cutoff of 2. 5. Results The linear regression equations and (R 2) s as well as the trendlines for malignant and benign nodules demonstrated that the slope of the regression line is greater for malignant than for benign nodules. Twenty-eight nodules of group one (≤ 1. 0 cm) are plotted in a <b>dot</b> <b>diagram</b> using an SUV max cutoff of 2. 5. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were calculated to be 85 %, 36 % and 54 % respectively. Similarly, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were calculated for an SUV max cutoff of 2. 5 and found to be 91 %, 47 %, and 79 % respectively for group 2 (1. 1 – 2. 0 cm); 94 %, 23 %, and 76 %, respectively for group 3 (2. 1 – 3. 0 cm); and 100 %, 17 %, and 82 %,, respectively for group 4 (> 3. 0 cm). The previous results of the <b>dot</b> <b>diagram</b> indicating that the sensitivity and the accuracy of the test using an SUV max cutoff of 2. 5 are increased with an increase in the diameter of pulmonary nodules. Conclusion The slope of the regression line is greater for malignant than for benign nodules.

ZIAR tests were performed using 0. 25 zona pellucida/μl co-incubated with spermatozoa for 60 min. Acrosome reactions were measured with FITC-PSA staining, and expressed as {{the difference between}} stimulated and unstimulated (spontaneous) sperm populations. Results were compared with IVF rates of metaphase II oocytes. Interactive <b>dot</b> <b>diagrams</b> divided the patients into two groups, i. e.

The majority of NIPT technology is associated with Illumina platform. We investigated whether fetal trisomy 18 and 21 were sensitively and specifically detectable by semiconductor sequencer: Ion Proton. Methods: From March 2012 to October 2013, we enrolled 155 pregnant women with fetuses who were diagnosed as high risk of fetal defects at Xiamen Maternal & Child Health Care Hospital (Xiamen, Fujian, China). Adapter-ligated DNA libraries were analyzed by the Ion Proton™ System (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) with an average 0. 3 × sequencing coverage per nucleotide. Average total raw reads per sample was 6. 5 million and mean rate of uniquely mapped reads was 59. 0 %. The {{results of this study}} were derived from BWA mapping. Z-score was used for fetal trisomy 18 and 21 detection. Results: Interactive <b>dot</b> <b>diagrams</b> showed the minimal z-score values to discriminate negative versus positive cases of fetal trisomy 18 and 21. For fetal trisomy 18, the minimal z-score value of 2. 459 showed 100 % positive predictive and negative predictive values. The minimal z-score of 2. 566 was used to classify negative versus positive cases of fetal trisomy 21. Conclusion: These results provide the evidence that fetal trisomy 18 and 21 detection can be performed with semiconductor sequencer.

40|$|Background: Noninvasive {{prenatal}} testing (NIPT) {{to detect}} fetal aneuploidy using next-generation sequencing on ion semiconductor platforms has become common. There are several sequencers that can generate sufficient DNA reads for NIPT. However, the approval criteria vary among platforms and countries. This can delay {{the introduction of}} such devices and systems to clinics. A comparison of the sensitivity and specificity of two different platforms using the same sequencing chemistry could be useful in NIPT for fetal chromosomal aneuploidies. This would improve healthcare authorities' confidence in decision-making on sequencing-based tests. Methods: One hundred and one pregnant women who were predicted {{at high risk of}} fetal defects using conventional prenatal screening tests, and who underwent definitive diagnosis by full karyotyping, were enrolled from three hospitals in Korea. Most of the pregnant women (69. 79 %) received NIPT during weeks 11 - 13 of gestation and 30. 21 % during weeks 14 - 18. We used Ion Torrent PGM and Proton semi-conductor-based sequencers with 0. 3 x sequencing coverage depth. The average total reads of 101 samples were approximately 4. 5 and 7. 6 M for PGM and Proton, respectively. A Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) algorithm was used for the alignment, and a z-score was used to decide fetal trisomy 21. Interactive <b>dot</b> <b>diagrams</b> from the sequencing data showed minimal z-score values of 2. 07 and 2. 10 to discriminate negative versus positive cases of fetal trisomy 21 for the two different sequencing systems. Results: Our z-score-based discrimination method resulted in 100 % positive and negative prediction values for both ion semiconductor PGM and Proton sequencers, regardless of their sequencing chip and chemistry differences. Both platforms performed well at an early stage (11 - 13 weeks of gestation) compared with previous studies. Conclusions: These results suggested that, using two different sequencers, NIPT to detect fetal trisomy 21 in early pregnancy is accurate and platform-independent. The data suggested that the amount of sequencing and the application of common, simple, and robust statistical analyses are more important than sequencing chemistry and platform types. This result has practical implications in countries where PGM is approved for NIPT but the Proton system is not. ope...|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} {{conductance}} measurements in carbon nanotube based double quantum dots connected to two normal electrodes and a central superconducting finger. By operating our devices as Cooper pair beam splitters, we {{provide evidence for}} Crossed Andreev Reflection (CAR). We inject Cooper pairs in the superconducting electrode and measure the differential conductance at both left and right arm. The contacts split the device into two coupled quantum dots. Each of the quantum dots can be tuned by a lateral sidegate. If the two sidegates are tuned such that both quantum dots are at a transmission resonance, a considerable part of the injected Cooper pairs splits into different normal contacts. On the contrary, if {{only one of the}} two dots is at resonance, nearly all pairs tunnel to the same normal contact. By comparing different triple points in the double <b>dot</b> stability <b>diagram,</b> we demonstrate the contribution of split Cooper pairs to the total current.

40|$|Background: In recent years, {{many studies}} {{focused on the}} {{description}} and comparison of large sets of related bacteriophage genomes. Due to the peculiar mosaic structure of these genomes, few informative approaches for comparing whole genomes exist: <b>dot</b> plots <b>diagrams</b> give a mostly qualitative assessment of the similarity/dissimilarity between two or more genomes, and clustering techniques are used to classify genomes. Multiple alignments are conspicuously absent from this scene. Indeed, whole genome aligners interpret lack of similarity between sequences {{as an indication of}} rearrangements, insertions, or losses. This behavior makes them ill-prepared to align bacteriophage genomes, where even closely related strains can accomplish the same biological function with highly dissimilar sequences. Results: In this paper, we propose a multiple alignment strategy that exploits functional collinearity shared by related strains of bacteriophages, and uses partial orders to capture mosaicism of sets of genomes. As classical alignments do, the computed alignments can be used to predict that genes have the same biological function, {{even in the absence of}} detectable similarity.

40|$|Background: Computing the {{distance}} between two RNA secondary structures can contribute in understanding the functional relationship between them. When used repeatedly, such a procedure may lead to finding a query RNA structure of interest in a database of structures. Several methods are available for computing distances between RNAs represented as strings or graphs, but none utilize the RNA representation with dot plots. Since dot plots are essentially digital images, {{there is a clear}} motivation to devise an algorithm for computing {{the distance}} between dot plots based on image processing methods. Results: We have developed a new metric dubbed ’DoPloCompare’, which compares two RNA structures. The method is based on comparing <b>dot</b> plot <b>diagrams</b> that represent the secondary structures. When analyzing two diagrams and motivated by image processing, the distance is based on a combination of histogram correlations and a geometrical distance measure. We illustrate the procedure by an application that utilizes this metric on RNA sequences in order to locate peculiar point mutations that induce significant structural alternations relative to the wild type predicted secondary structure. The method was tested on several RNA sequences with known secondary structures to affirm their prediction, as well as on a data set of ribosomal pieces.
