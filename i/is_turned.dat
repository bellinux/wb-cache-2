The sight does not interfere with the overall view, particularly when the collimator light <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> off. Both eyes may be used simultaneously for sighting.|$|E

5|$|The crosier was {{displayed}} {{as a symbol}} of pastoral jurisdiction by bishops, abbots, abbesses, and cardinals even if they were not bishops. The crosier of a bishop <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> outward or to the right. Frequently the crosier of an abbot or abbess <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> inward, either toward the mitre or to the left, but this distinction is disputed and is not an absolute rule. Pope Alexander VII decreed in 1659 that the crosiers of abbots include a sudarium or veil, but this is not customary in English heraldry. The veil may have arisen because abbots, unlike bishops, did not wear gloves when carrying an actual crosier. Because the cross has similar symbolism, the crosier was suppressed for cardinals and bishops by the Catholic Church in 1969, and is now used only on some corporate arms, and the personal arms of abbots and some abbesses. In English custom and in the Anglican Churches, two crosiers are often found crossed in saltire behind the shield. In the Lutheran Church of Sweden, the crosier is displayed in the arms of bishops in office but is removed when a bishop retires.|$|E

5|$|The {{influence}} of this old constellation of iconographic elements {{can still be}} seen in contemporary representations of Ganesha. In one modern form, the only variation from these old elements is that the lower-right hand does not hold the broken tusk but <b>is</b> <b>turned</b> towards the viewer {{in a gesture of}} protection or fearlessness (abhaya mudra). The same combination of four arms and attributes occurs in statues of Ganesha dancing, which is a very popular theme.|$|E
5|$|The poet Ovid also {{dealt with}} the mythology of the narcissus.

This theme of metamorphosis was broader than just Narcissus; for instance see crocus, laurel and hyacinth.|$|E

Now the lights <b>are</b> <b>turned</b> on at night, and turned off at 2 am.|$|R
