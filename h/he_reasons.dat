5|$|After soccer practice, Bart {{waits for}} Homer {{to pick him}} up, though his father has forgotten. When Homer finally remembers, <b>he</b> <b>reasons</b> to an angered Bart that they should just both admit they are wrong and try to put the issue behind them. Later, Bart views a {{commercial}} for a mentor program called The Bigger Brothers, which pairs up fatherless boys with positive male role models. Still angry at Homer, Bart goes to the agency {{pretending to be a}} young boy whose father was a drunken gambler who abandoned him. Bart's story is so sad that the receptionist pairs him up with their best Bigger Brother, a military test pilot named Tom. The two spend time together doing a variety of activities, though Bart begins to feel guilty over taking up Tom's time despite not actually being fatherless. Eventually, Homer finds out about Bart's Bigger Brother and confronts Bart for it. Homer then decides to go to the Bigger Brothers Agency to get revenge by being assigned with a replacement son; a young poor boy named Pepi. Just like Tom and Bart, Homer and Pepi spend time together doing activities.|$|E
5|$|Before {{leaving the}} next morning, the Doctor stops to ask Emma {{if she could}} sense {{anything}} unusual about Clara, but Emma reveals that Clara seems normal to her. The Doctor offers Hila a lift to any other place in history and concludes {{that she is a}} direct descendant of Emma and Palmer. <b>He</b> <b>reasons</b> that their relation resulted in a blood connection that helped them open the gateway to rescue her. While contemplating the bonds that love can create, the Doctor suddenly realises that there is another creature within Caliburn House. Just as Emma and Palmer were not part of a ghost story but a love story, the Doctor considers the same for the creatures — that the one trapped in the pocket universe has been trying to reunite with its mate. The Doctor asks Emma for a favour and they use Emma and the TARDIS to retrieve the other creature from the pocket universe.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} part of his book is {{about the nature of}} genius. Weininger argues {{that there is no such}} thing as a person who has a genius for, say, mathematics, or music, but there is only the universal genius, in whom everything exists and makes sense. <b>He</b> <b>reasons</b> that such genius is probably present in all people to some degree.|$|E
5000|$|Schleicher was an {{advocate}} of the polygenesis of languages. <b>He</b> <b>reasoned</b> as follows (1876:2): ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Maybe I {{had better}} tell Slugger and Nappy first {{and see what}} they've got to say about it," [...] <b>he</b> <b>reasoned.</b> <b>He</b> went to the bully and his crony with everything.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sam {{ought to}} have been able to follow their trail," [...] <b>he</b> <b>reasoned.</b> <b>He</b> did not know that the trail had been {{followed}} as far as the stream where the Indians had first brought forth their hidden canoes.|$|R
25|$|The Meditator {{reasons that}} he need only find {{some reason to}} doubt his present {{opinions}} in order to prompt him to seek sturdier foundations for knowledge. Rather than doubt {{every one of his}} opinions individually, <b>he</b> <b>reasons</b> that he might cast them all into doubt if he can doubt the foundations and basic principles on which the opinions are founded.|$|E
25|$|While on surveillance, McNulty watches Spiros Vondas, an {{associate}} of an underworld figure known as The Greek, sending a text message. <b>He</b> <b>reasons</b> that the time and location of the text {{could be used to}} retrieve it from the phone company's databases; it is from this message that the detail learns that the Greek had shut down his operations. After McNulty learns from Bubbles that Stringer Bell and Barksdale rival Proposition Joe are sharing territory, he begins investigating them on his own time, convinced that he can gather enough evidence to prompt Daniels to focus the Major Crimes Unit's attention on Stringer.|$|E
25|$|He {{extensively}} discusses playwright Molière's work, {{and uses}} the play Le Misanthrope to exemplify a comedy in which the audience derives immoral pleasure. In the play, the main character, Alceste, is good and honest in his relationships with men and made to look ridiculous, whereas Philinte, a deceiver and manipulator, is shown as superior. Rousseau considers this play to be a work of genius, but it is, of course, morally backwards. <b>He</b> <b>reasons</b> that even if comedy writers write a play that is morally acceptable, the audience will not find it funny. Therefore, theatres are of little use.|$|E
5000|$|About the casteist {{angle of}} the criticism, <b>he</b> <b>reasoned</b> {{that it was because}} of him being the author of the scheme: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No use of {{reporting}} this to Captain Putnam," [...] <b>he</b> <b>reasoned.</b> [...] "Ritter would, of course, deny everything. Wonder {{if he did}} much damage?" ...|$|R
60|$|Through the beaming {{smile with}} which he {{regarded}} me as <b>he</b> <b>reasoned</b> thus, there now broke forth a look of disinterested benevolence quite astonishing.|$|R
25|$|Todd's {{spiritual journey}} was crafted {{as a man}} who wanted {{forgiveness}} for his past misdeeds. In the story, <b>he</b> <b>reasons</b> that he does not deserve forgiveness; this contributes to him embracing his worst qualities. Malone was intrigued by telling this type of character aspect, and felt that it worked better due to Howarth being an actor who would not let Todd acquire redemption easily. Malone felt {{the most important part of}} Todd's redemption was to have him re-confront Marty in order to better deal with the fact that he initiated a gang rape on her. Despite the character's eagerness to be thought of as a decent human being, the writers felt that these good deeds should never make Todd feel any less horrible for having raped Marty.|$|E
500|$|In {{pursuit of}} the Augments, Enterprise arrives in Klingon space [...] having faked a Klingon warp signature. [...] Soong {{releases}} a hostage on a Denobulan shuttle into a gas giant, forcing the Enterprise to abandon their pursuit and mount a rescue operation. [...] Escaping, Malik proposes a new plan: trigger a war between Starfleet and the Klingons as a distraction by firing a pathogen-filled torpedo at a Klingon colony. <b>He</b> <b>reasons</b> that Starfleet will be too busy fighting the Klingons to hunt down the Augments. [...] Soong will {{have nothing to do}} with Malik's genocidal proposal. [...] On the Enterprise, Commander T'Pol asks Commander Tucker about the distance between them after her recent arranged marriage [...] (""), and he tells her he has come to terms with their new relationship.|$|E
500|$|Together {{with the}} concept of an {{economic}} [...] "elasticity" [...] coefficient, Alfred Marshall is credited with defining PED ("elasticity of demand") in his book Principles of Economics, published in 1890. He described it thus: [...] "And we may say generally:— the elasticity (or responsiveness) of demand in a market is great or small according as the amount demanded increases much or little for a given fall in price, and diminishes much or little for a given rise in price". <b>He</b> <b>reasons</b> this since [...] "the only universal law as to a person's desire for a commodity is that it diminishes... but this diminution may be slow or rapid. If it is slow... a small fall in price will cause a comparatively large increase in his purchases. But if it is rapid, a small fall in price will cause only a very small increase in his purchases. In the former case... the elasticity of his wants, we may say, is great. In the latter case... the elasticity of his demand is small." [...] Mathematically, the Marshallian PED was based on a point-price definition, using differential calculus to calculate elasticities.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who knows {{but what}} I {{may go to}} work to-morrow, and then I won't get much chance to look around," [...] <b>he</b> <b>reasoned</b> to himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I get {{anything}} {{it will be}} more accident than anything else," [...] <b>he</b> <b>reasoned.</b> [...] "No animal is going to stir out in this storm." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is enough}} to drive one insane," [...] <b>he</b> <b>reasoned.</b> [...] "Where {{in the world did}} they go to? I'd give a {{thousand}} dollars to know." ...|$|R
500|$|While {{the team}} investigates several pathologies {{to fit the}} bus driver's condition, House overdoses on his Vicodin and starts to hallucinate. He finds himself back on the bus, where he sees a woman (Ivana Miličević) who {{was not on the}} bus. However, before House can speak to her, Wilson awakens him to do an MRI on him. When House returns to the bus hallucination, Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein) is with him. As they discuss the bus driver's {{possible}} diseases, House realizes they are in his head and tells Cuddy to accompany the discussion with a strip tease. Cuddy complies, but just before she takes off her bra, she notes that she is distracting House and stops stripping. The woman from House's earlier hallucination returns and introduces herself as [...] "the answer". She tells House to look at the bus driver's shuffling feet, which House believes to indicate Parkinson's disease. When the bus driver needs to be intubated due to a possible clot from a pulmonary embolism, House notices the driver's recent dental work. <b>He</b> <b>reasons</b> that an air bubble being accidentally injected into the patient's bloodstream through the gums would explain all the symptoms, so the bubble is extracted and the patient is saved. House believes the case to be over, but a dream that night causes him to realize that the bus driver is not the patient he saw suffering from symptoms; the crash merely dislodged the air bubble and caused the driver's problems.|$|E

2500|$|Historian Joseph B. Thoburn {{considers}} {{the destruction of}} Black Kettle's village too one-sided {{to be called a}} battle. <b>He</b> <b>reasons</b> that had a superior force of Indians attacked a white settlement containing no more people than were in Black Kettle's camp, with like results, the incident would doubtless have been heralded as [...] "a massacre". Historian Stan Hoig argues that the conflict fit the definition of a massacre because a group of people, even one in possession of weapons as the Cheyenne were, were killed [...] "indiscriminately, mercilessly and in large numbers".|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{ought to}} clear Phil and the others," [...] <b>he</b> <b>reasoned.</b> [...] "And {{they can come}} back to school without delay and finish the term and graduate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They won't {{come back}} for me now," [...] <b>he</b> <b>reasoned.</b> [...] "Perhaps the {{steamboat}} is sinking and the others have enough to do to think of saving themselves." ...|$|R
50|$|Not be too ostentatious:Muller {{refused the}} {{suggestion}} {{in the early}} 1940s to buy a Cadillac, {{the top of the}} line car in the US, and instead bought a Packard. <b>He</b> <b>reasoned</b> <b>he</b> could buy two cars for the price of one Cadillac and they were not as showy.|$|R
2500|$|Complementarian scholar Wayne A. Grudem {{objects to}} Webb's use of [...] "complementary" [...] and [...] "egalitarian" [...] {{together}} {{to describe a}} thoroughly egalitarian position. Calling the terminology [...] "offensive and confusing," [...] <b>he</b> <b>reasons</b> that doing so simply confuses the issues by using the term [...] "complementary" [...] for a position totally antithetical to what complementarians hold. Grudem finds Webb's {{use of the term}} [...] "patriarchy" [...] to be especially pejorative because of its connotations in modern society. He also rejects the term [...] "hierarchicalist" [...] because he says it overemphasizes structured authority while giving no suggestion of equality or the beauty of mutual interdependence.|$|E
2500|$|Their {{new style}} of psychology, later dubbed {{functional}} psychology, had a practical emphasis on action and application. In Dewey's article [...] "The Reflex Arc Concept in Psychology" [...] {{which appeared in}} Psychological Review in 1896, <b>he</b> <b>reasons</b> against the traditional stimulus-response understanding of the reflex arc {{in favor of a}} [...] "circular" [...] account in which what serves as [...] "stimulus" [...] and what as [...] "response" [...] depends on how one considers the situation, and defends the unitary nature of the sensory motor circuit. While he does not deny the existence of stimulus, sensation, and response, he disagreed that they were separate, juxtaposed events happening like links in a chain. He developed {{the idea that there is}} a coordination by which the stimulation is enriched by the results of previous experiences. The response is modulated by sensorial experience.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Adam has {{complied}} with Robin's orders but has unfortunately chosen to abduct Dame Hannah. [...] The dame proves formidable indeed, and Robin {{cries out for}} his uncle's protection. Sir Roderic duly appears, recognises his former love and, angered that his former fiancée has been abducted, dismisses Robin. [...] Left alone, he and Dame Hannah enjoy a brief reunion. [...] Robin interrupts them, accompanied by Rose, Richard and the bridesmaids. He quibbles that, {{under the terms of}} the curse, a Baronet of Ruddigore can die only by refusing to commit a daily crime. [...] Refusing is therefore [...] "tantamount to suicide", but suicide is, itself, a crime. [...] Thus, <b>he</b> <b>reasons,</b> his predecessors [...] "ought never to have died at all."* [...] Roderic follows this logic and agrees, stating that he is [...] "practically" [...] alive.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I {{look for}} wood I'll get wet again," [...] <b>he</b> <b>reasoned.</b> [...] "And if I don't {{go and get}} some the fire will leave me in the cold." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For all I know, {{that claim}} {{may be worth}} a fortune," [...] <b>he</b> <b>reasoned.</b> [...] "Anyway, it's worth something, or that man wouldn't be so anxious to get the papers." ...|$|R

2500|$|The novel {{begins in}} Verloc's home, {{as he and}} his wife discuss the trivialities of {{everyday}} life, which introduces the reader to Verloc's family. Soon after, Verloc leaves to meet Mr. Vladimir, the new First Secretary in the embassy of a foreign country. [...] Although a member of an anarchist cell, Verloc is also secretly employed by the Embassy as an agent provocateur. Vladimir informs Verloc that from reviewing his service history he is far from an exemplary model of a secret agent and, to redeem himself, must carry out an operation – the destruction of Greenwich Observatory by a bomb explosion. Vladimir explains that Britain's lax attitude to anarchism endangers his own country, and <b>he</b> <b>reasons</b> that an attack on 'science', which he claims is the current vogue amongst the public, will provide the necessary outrage for suppression. Verloc later meets with his friends, who discuss politics and law, and the notion of a communist revolution. Unbeknownst to the group, Stevie, Verloc's brother-in-law, overhears the conversation, which greatly disturbs him.|$|E
2500|$|Vision {{appeared}} in [...] (2016). During the film, he sides with Iron Man's group during the titular conflict. <b>He</b> <b>reasons</b> this by remarking {{that the number}} of supernatural or highly dangerous events have increased since Tony Stark's admitting of his secret identity and that government oversight will assist the team. This includes effectively confining Scarlet Witch to the Avengers' compound after the latter's involvement in the collateral damage in Lagos. Vision overpowers Hawkeye, who tries to break Scarlet Witch out, until she interferes, telekinetically pushing Vision hundreds of feet beneath the compound. As expected, Vision is unharmed and escapes to later participate in the battle to capture Captain America's allies. During the battle, he aims to disable the Falcon, however, accidentally shoots down and cripples War Machine, as he was distracted while tending to Scarlet Witch. This movie also hints at Vision and Scarlet Witch's relationship in the comics, with Vision confused about the mild emotions he experienced around her and his increased desire to keep her safe.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, former Intel Corporation Chairman and CEO Andrew Grove {{looked to}} energy resilience, arguing that {{complete}} independence is unfeasible given {{the global market}} for energy. He describes energy resilience {{as the ability to}} adjust to interruptions in the supply of energy. To that end, he suggests the U.S. make greater use of electricity. Electricity can be produced from a variety of sources. A diverse energy supply will be less affected by the disruption in supply of any one source. <b>He</b> <b>reasons</b> that another feature of electrification is that electricity is [...] "sticky" [...] – meaning the electricity produced in the U.S. is to stay there because it cannot be transported overseas. [...] According to Grove, a key aspect of advancing electrification and energy resilience will be converting the U.S. automotive fleet from gasoline-powered to electric-powered. This, in turn, will require the modernization and expansion of the electrical power grid. As organizations such as The Reform Institute have pointed out, advancements associated with the developing smart grid would facilitate the ability of the grid to absorb vehicles en masse connecting to it to charge their batteries.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{ought to}} have the whole crowd locked up," [...] <b>he</b> <b>reasoned.</b> [...] "But it would be the {{testimony}} of one against four, and they would most likely deny everything." ...|$|R
