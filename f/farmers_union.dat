5|$|A {{student at}} Van Meter High School, Feller was a {{starting}} pitcher for the school's baseball team. During {{this time he}} continued {{to play on the}} <b>Farmers</b> <b>Union</b> team in the American Amateur Baseball Congress, and had 19 wins and four losses for <b>Farmers</b> <b>Union</b> one season. He also was the starting center for the high school basketball team. By the age of 16, Feller possessed what critics judged a high quality fastball; major league scouts traveled to Dayton, Ohio to watch him in the annual national baseball tournament. After the game, several big league clubs offered signing bonuses with their contract offers, but he had already been signed to a professional contract with the Cleveland Indians.|$|E
5|$|By 1990, 52,000 black {{families}} had been settled on 6.5 million acres. This was insufficient {{to deal with}} the country's overcrowding problem, which was being exacerbated by the growth in the black population. That year, Zimbabwe's parliament passed an amendment allowing the government to expropriate land at a fixed price while denying land-owners the right of appeal to the courts. The government hoped that by doing so it could settle 110,000 {{black families}} on 13 million acres, which would require the expropriation of approximately half of all white-owned land. Zimbabwe's Commercial <b>Farmers</b> <b>Union</b> argued that the proposed measures would wreck the country's economy, urging the government to instead settle landless blacks on the half-a-million acres of land that was either unproductive or state-owned.|$|E
5|$|In 1957 Van der Byl {{was made}} a Director of the United Dominions Corporation (Rhodesia) Ltd, having already become {{an active member of}} the Rhodesia Tobacco Association.

His first involvement in government was in 1960 when the Rhodesia Tobacco Association made him one of their representatives on the National Native Labour Commission, on which he served for two years. In 1961, he also represented the Rhodesia Tobacco Association on the council of the Rhodesian National <b>Farmers</b> <b>Union.</b> He was recognised as a leading spokesman for Rhodesian tobacco farmers.|$|E

5|$|Following summer floods of 1997 and the {{prolonged}} flooding of 1999-2000 the Parrett Catchment Project was formed, partly {{funded by the}} European Union Regional Development Fund, by 30 organisations, including British Waterways, Campaign to Protect Rural England, Countryside Agency, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Environment Agency, Kings Sedgemoor and Cary Vale Internal Drainage Board (now part of Parrett Internal Drainage Board), Levels and Moors Partnership, National <b>Farmers</b> <b>Union,</b> Sedgemoor, Somerset County Council, South Somerset District Council, Taunton Deane and Wessex Water. They aim to tackle twelve areas, which, when combined, will make {{a significant contribution to}} reducing the adverse effects of flooding. These include the conversion of arable land, adoption of the Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) approach to controlling rainwater runoff from developed areas, dredging, raising riverbanks and improving pumping facilities. Further studies of the possible beneficial effects of woodland in reducing flooding have also been undertaken.|$|E
5|$|In April 1962, McGovern {{announced}} he would run for election to South Dakota's other Senate seat, intending to face incumbent Republican Francis H. Case. Case died in June, however, and McGovern instead faced an appointed senator, former Lieutenant Governor Joseph H. Bottum. Much of the campaign revolved around policies of the Kennedy administration and its New Frontier; Bottum accused the Kennedy family of trying to buy the Senate seat. McGovern appealed to those worried about the outflux of young people from the state, and had the strong support of the <b>Farmers</b> <b>Union.</b> Polls showed Bottum slightly ahead throughout the race and McGovern was hampered by a recurrence of his hepatitis problem in the final weeks of the campaign. (During this hospitalization, McGovern read Theodore H. White's classic The Making of the President, 1960 {{and for the first}} time began thinking about running for the office someday.) Eleanor McGovern campaigned for her ailing husband and may have preserved his chance of winning. The November 1962 election result was very close and required a recount, but McGovern's 127,458 votes prevailed by a margin of 597, making him the first Democratic senator from the state in 26 years and only the third since statehood in 1889.|$|E
