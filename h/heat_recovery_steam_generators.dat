40|$|Combined {{cycle power}} plants play an {{important}} role in the present energy sector. The main challenge in designing a combined cycle power plant is proper utilization of gas turbine exhaust heat in the steam cycle in order to achieve optimum steam turbine output. Most of the combined cycle developers focused on the gas turbine output and neglected the role of the <b>heat</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> which strongly affects the overall performance of the combined cycle power plant. The present paper is aimed at optimal utilization of the flue gas <b>recovery</b> <b>heat</b> with different <b>heat</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> configurations of single pressure and dual pressure. The combined cycle efficiency with different <b>heat</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> configurations have been analyzed parametrically by using first law and second law of thermodynamics. It is observed that in the dual cycle high pressure steam turbine pressure must be high and low pressure steam turbine pressure must be low for better <b>heat</b> <b>recovery</b> from <b>heat</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generator...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{integrated}} solar plant {{concept was}} initially proposed by Luz Solar International [1] {{as a means}} of integrating a parabolic trough solar plant with modern combined cycle power plants. An integrated plant consists of a conventional combined cycle plant, a solar collector field, and a solar <b>steam</b> <b>generator.</b> During sunny periods, feedwater is withdrawn from the combined cycle plant <b>heat</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generator,</b> and converted to saturated steam in the solar <b>steam</b> <b>generator.</b> The saturated <b>steam</b> is returned to the <b>heat</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generator,</b> and the combined fossil and solar steam flows are superheated in the <b>heat</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generator.</b> The increased <b>steam</b> flow rate provides an increase in the output of the Rankine cycle. During cloudy periods and at night, the integrated plant operates as a conventional combined cycle facility. Two studies on integrated plant designs using a General Electric Frame 7 (FA) gas turbine and a three pressure <b>heat</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> are currently being conducted by the authors. Preliminary results include the following items: 1) the most efficient use of solar thermal energy is the production of high pressure saturated steam for addition to the <b>heat</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>steam</b> generator; 2) the quantity of high pressure steam generation duty which can be transferred from the <b>heat</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> to the solar <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> is limited; thus, the maximum practical solar contribution is also reasonably well defined...|$|R
50|$|The {{configuration}} {{of these plants}} involves replacing the old coal boiler with gas-fired turbine (GT). The gas-fired outputs exhaust heat to a <b>heat</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> (HRSG). From {{the output of the}} <b>heat</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> it is run into a steam turbine which increases electricity production and the overall efficiency of the plant. The gas-fired turbine (GT) and the <b>heat</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> (HRSG) technology has been in utilize in many repowering projects over the past 20 years in the United States alone. With increasing environmental regulations of the United States Government and the lower fuel prices made the usage of GT/HRSG an option in utilizing to renew many old coal heating power plants. This modern gas turbines operate with higher efficiencies and adding a <b>heat</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> (HRSG) raises overall plant efficiency to 40 percent to 50 percent (HHV) above the range of most coal-fired plants, reducing fuel consumption and lowering plant emissions. Siemens Corporation are also using this technology by combining the gas turbine (GT) in conjunction with the <b>heat</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>steam</b> <b>generator</b> (HRSG) with the steam turbine (ST) and the combined cycle power plants to produce the most efficient power generation facilities. Existing direct-fired plants can utilize this advanced cycle concept by adding a GT and a HRSG. This so-called repowering scheme makes the existing power generation facility equally efficient as modern combined cycle power plant.|$|R
