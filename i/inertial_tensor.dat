40|$|AbstractThe state {{estimation}} for relative motion {{with respect to}} non-cooperative spacecraft in rendezvous and docking (RVD) is a challenging problem. In this paper, a completely non-cooperative case is considered, which means that both orbit elements and <b>inertial</b> <b>tensor</b> of target spacecraft are unknown. By formulating the equations of relative translational dynamics in the orbital plane of chaser spacecraft, the issue of unknown orbit elements is solved. And for the problem for unknown <b>inertial</b> <b>tensor,</b> we propose a novel robust estimator named interaction cubature Kalman filter (InCKF) to handle it. The novel filter consists of multiple concurrent CKFs interlacing with a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator. The initial estimations provided by the multiple CKFs are used in a Bayesian framework to form description of posteriori probability about <b>inertial</b> <b>tensor</b> and the MAP estimator is applied to giving the optimal estimation. By exploiting special property of spherical-radial (SR) rule, a novel method with respect to approximating the likelihood probability of <b>inertial</b> <b>tensor</b> is presented. In addition, the issue about vision sensor’s location inconformity with center mass of chaser spacecraft is also considered. The performance of this filter is demonstrated by the estimation problem of RVD at the final phase. And the simulation {{results show that the}} performance of InCKF is better than that of extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the estimation accuracy of pose and attitude is relatively high even in the completely non-cooperative case...|$|E

However, inertia is absent from the dynamics of a magnetic dipole (the Landau-Lifshitz equation, the Gilbert equation and the Bloch equation contain only the first derivative of the magnetization with respect to time). In order to investigate this paradoxical situation, the lagrangian approach (proposed originally by T. H.

It is shown how both the usual gyromagnetic relation and the well-known Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation are recovered at the kinetic limit, i. e. for time scales above the relaxation time τ of the angular momentum.

40|$|Recently a {{model of}} metric {{fluctuations}} has been proposed which yields an effective Schrödinger equation for a quantum particle with a modified inertial mass, leading to {{a violation of the}} weak equivalence principle. The renormalization of the <b>inertial</b> mass <b>tensor</b> results from a local space average over the fluctuations of the metric over a fixed background metric.

We derive a quantum master equation for the particle’s density matrix, discuss in detail its dissipation and decoherence properties, and estimate the corresponding decoherence time scales. By contrast to other models discussed in the literature, in the present approach the metric fluctuations give rise to a decay of the coherences in the energy representation, i. e., to a localization in energy space. ...|$|R

40|$|Perimeter {{security}} cable {{barriers are}} widely used by various government agencies {{all over the world}} to defeat threat vehicle penetration. Any new barrier design requires validation prior to implementation. Full-scale vehicular crash tests for validations are costly, while validation through finite element (FE) crash simulations are time consuming and requires specialized skills. Based on full-scale crash tests, an innovative and simple algorithm has been developed in this research to model the progressive failure of perimeter security cable barrier. ^ A different approach from the conventional FE method was developed in an attempt to reduce computer runtime. The entire event is divided into small time-steps of 0. 5 milliseconds or less. Vehicle is modeled as an assembly of three-dimensional (3 D) rigid and deformable parts made of solid and shell elements, connected by inelastic truss members. Stiffness of solid and shell elements are ignored. Nonlinear structural responses due to the inelastic material effect and large deformation of these truss members were taken into account. A method was developed to compute <b>inertial</b> <b>tensors</b> from vehicle solid elements and cargo loads. A 3 D contact algorithm was developed to identify contacts between multiple faces and multiple vertices of multiple bodies. For a cable barrier, a 3 D vehicle model interacts with a 3 D cable barrier model during a time step, resulting in deformation of the cables and contact forces. In order to have an efficient simulation, only the predominant failure modes observed in the crash tests are modeled. Elasto-plastic deformation of cables, posts and vehicle are considered in the algorithm. For a particular crash scenario with known anchor parameters, a method was developed to estimate the energy dissipated in the post-soil interaction based on standard empirical equations, available crash tests and published literatures. Estimated energy dissipated is then included in each time step during the simulation. ^ The simulation model developed has been validated against three perimeter security cable barrier crash tests. This user-friendly cable barrier model, displaying simulation results graphically, can be used to provide realistic parameters for a perimeter security cable barrier design within less than 10 minutes of simulation runtime. ...|$|R

Attitude control for AOS with a swinging sensor will be highlighted in this paper. Due to the non-negligible mass and length of the sensor, the internal motion between the satellite and the sensor will change the attitude, the position of center of mass and moment of inertia of the SYSTEM (consists of the satellite and the sensor). According to moment of momentum theorem, a rigid two-body dynamic model is derived, {{which can be used}} to determine the <b>inertial</b> <b>tensor</b> of the SYSTEM. Modulating the satellite's present and desired quaternions results in quasi-Euler angles and normalizing these resultant parameters can ensure that the channel corresponding to each quasi-Euler angle is in the charge of each component of the control torque. Based on the normalized quasi-Euler angles, a switching attitude control law is proposed. With the control law, the corresponding phase trajectory will slide along the switching surface to the origin (corresponding to the desired states). Simulation results show that the satellite can be controlled perfectly by thrusters with the proposed control law, even in the case of structural asymmetry and serious coupling between the control channels...|$|E

Starting from the Zel'dovich approximation to structure formation, a dark halo is approximated by a homogeneous ellipsoid with the <b>inertial</b> <b>tensor</b> of the (highly irregular) Lagrangian region Υ from which the dark halo forms. Within this approximation, an expression for the spin parameter can be derived, which depends on the geometry of Υ, the cosmological density parameter Ω_ 0, the overdensity of the dark halo, and the tidal torque exerted on it. For Gaussian random fields, this expression can be evaluated statistically. As a result, we derive a probability distribution of the spin parameter which gives λ≃ 0. 07 ^+ 0. 04 _- 0. 05, consistent with numerical investigations. This probability distribution steeply rises with increasing spin parameter, reaching its maximum at λ≃ 0. 025. The 10 (50, 90) percentile values are λ= 0. 02 (0. 05, 0. 11, respectively).

40|$|The gravity {{field of}} the Earth is {{fundamental}} to subjects such as geodesy and geophysics. Many observations within geodesy refer directly or indirectly to gravity. Geodetic techniques provide information regarding the Earth and the processes that act on it. Mass and angular momentum are, according to physics, conserved in a closed system. The Earth interacts very little with components outside of it and {{can be thought of}} as a closed system. Mass components in one reservoir of the Earth system are exchanged with others. Mass redistribution within the Earth system is caused by geophysical processes. This movement of geophysical fluid (mass) causes variations in the Earth’s rotation, gravity field and geocentre. The improvement of geodetic techniques over the last few decades allows us to measure the effects of these processes on the Earth to an unprecedented accuracy. Earth rotation parameters (ERPs) are excited by variations in the mass distribution on the Earth’s surface and the exchange of angular momentum between the atmosphere and oceans and the solid Earth. The same mass redistribution causes temporal changes in the gravity field coefficients with the second degree harmonics related to the rotational deformation and hence to changes in the Earth’s <b>inertial</b> <b>tensor.</b> If precise models of the atmospheric and oceanic angular momentum are available solution for polar motion and degree- 2 Stokes harmonics can be unified. In this study we utilise SLR tracking of LAGEOS to compare (i) degree- 2 harmonics from ERPs and gravitation, and (ii) LAGEOS excitation functions and geophysical data (mass + motion). To what extent a unified approach is possible with current models for AM data and gravity mass change estimated from ERP within orbit determinations is investigated.

A domain containing m= 0, 28, or 56 melted basepairs (out of 4349 total) is modeled simply by a region of suitable length with substantially reduced torsion and bending elastic constants. Average structural properties are calculated from the saved configurations, and a reversible work protocol {{is used to calculate}} the supercoiling free energy, ΔGsc. The cross-writhe between duplex and melted regions (defined herein) is found to be negligibly small. The total writhe, radius of gyration, and ordered elements of the diagonalized <b>inertial</b> <b>tensor</b> are found to be nearly universal functions of the residual linking difference (〈Δℓr〉) associated with the duplex region, independent of m. However, deformability of the tertiary structure, as manifested by the variance of those same properties, is not a universal function of 〈Δℓr〉, but depends upon m. ΔGsc varies with 〈Δℓr〉 more strongly than 〈Δℓr〉 2 due to the low ionic strength. The twist energy parameter, ET, obtained from the simulated ΔGsc, 〈Δℓr〉, and net twisting strain of the melted region,〈TD〉, is found to be independent of m, hence also of the torsion and bending elastic constants of the melted region. However, ET increases linearly with −〈Δℓr〉, which leads to 1), a small overestimation of ET for any given 〈Δℓr〉, when ET is determined from the observed Δℓ and 〈Δℓr〉 by the protocol of Bauer and Benham; and 2), a significant enhancement of the apparent slope, ⁡−⁡dET/dT, obtained via the protocol of Bauer and Benham, relative to the actual slope at fixed 〈Δℓr〉. After taking these two effects into account, the theoretical and experimental ET values and −⁡dET/dT values agree rather well.

40|$|The {{first part}} of this thesis studies the problem of {{symmetry}} breaking in the context of simple mechanical systems with compact symmetry Lie group G. In this part we shall assume that the principal stratum of the G-action on the configuration space Q of a given mechanical system is associated to the trivial subgroup {e}. Let T be a maximal torus of G whose Lie algebra is denoted by t. Let qe ∈ Q be a given point with nontrivial symmetry Gqe &#x 2260; {e} and assume that Gqe &#x 2286; T. We shall make the hypothesis that the values of the infinitesimal generators of elements in t at qe are all relative equilibria of the given mechanical system. These relative equilibria form a vector subspace t · qe of TqeQ. As will be shown, every relative equilibrium in this subspace has symmetry equal to Gqe. The goal of this part of the thesis is to give sufficient conditions capable to insure the existence of points in this subspace from which symmetry breaking branches of relative equilibria with trivial symmetry will emerge. Sufficient Lyapunov stability conditions along these branches will be given if G = T. The strategy of the method can be roughly described as follows. Take a regular element μ ∈ g* which happens to be the momentum value of some relative equilibrium defined by an element of t. Choose a one parameter perturbation β(τ, μ) ∈ g* of μ that lies in the set of regular points of g*, for small values of the parameter τ > 0. Consider the Gqe-representation on the tangent space TqeQ. Let vqe be an element in the principal stratum of the representation and also in the normal space to the tangent space at qe to the orbit G · qe. Assume that its norm is small enough in order for vqe to lie in the open ball centered at the origin 0 qe ∈ TqeQ where the Riemannian exponential is a diffeomorphism. The curve τvqe projects by the exponential map to a curve qe(τ) in a neighborhood of qe in Q whose value at τ = 0 is qe. We search for relative equilibria in TQ starting at points in t · qe such that their base curves in Q equal qe(τ) and their momentum values are β(τ, μ). Not all possible perturbations β(τ,μ) are allowed and {{it is part of the}} problem to determine which ones will yield symmetry breaking bifurcating branches of relative equilibria. To do this, let ζ(τ,vqe,μ) ∈ g be the image of β(τ,μ) by the inverse of the locked <b>inertial</b> <b>tensor</b> of the mechanical problem under consideration evaluated at qe(τ) for τ > 0. If one can show that the limit ζ(0, vqe,μ) of ζ(τ,vqe,μ) exists and belongs to t for τ → 0, then the infinitesimal generator of ζ(0,vqe,μ) evaluated at qe is automatically a relative equilibrium since it belongs to t · qe. We shall determine an open Gqe-invariant neighborhood U of the origin in the orthogonal complement to the tangent space to the orbit G · qe such that this limit exists whenever vqe ∈ U. Next, we will determine a family vqe(τ,μ 1) ∈ TQ and, among all possible ζ(τ, vqe,μ), another family ζ(τ,μ 1) ∈ g such that the infinitesimal generators of ζ(τ,μ 1) evaluated at the base points Exp(τvqe(τ,μ 1)) of τvqe(τ,μ 1) are relative equilibria. Here μ 1 is a certain component in a direct sum decomposition of g* naturally associated to the bifurcation problem. This produces a branch of relative equilibria starting in the subspace t ·qe which has trivial isotropy for τ > 0 and which depends smoothly on the parameter μ 1 ∈ g*. In the process, the precise form of the perturbation β(τ,μ) is also determined; it is a quadratic polynomial in τ whose coefficients are certain components in the direct sum decomposition of g* mentioned above. There are two technical problems in this procedure: the existence of the limit of ζ(τ,vqe,μ) as τ → 0 and the extension of the amended potential at points with symmetry. The existence of the limit is shown using the Lyapunov-Schmidt procedure. To extend the amended potential and its derivatives at points with symmetry, two auxiliary functions obtained by blow-up are introduced. The analysis breaks up in two bifurcation problems on a space orthogonal to the G-orbit. The bifurcation results of this chapter can be regarded as an extension of the thesis of Hernández [20] and the work of Hernández and Marsden [21]. The main difference is that only one single hypothesis from [21] has been retained, namely that all points given by infinitesimal generators of elements of t evaluated at qe are relative equilibria. We have eliminated an essential non-degeneracy assumption in [21], namely that G acts freely in some G-invariant neighborhood of the G-orbit of qe excluding the orbit itself. This hypothesis excludes in effect the existence of other strata near the G-orbit of qe. Our results allow the existence of different orbit types near this relative equilibrium. A second assumption that was eliminated is the hypothesis that the isotropy subgroup of qe is the circle S 1. In addition, the conclusions of our final result are stronger. The main theorem of this chapter guarantees the existence of multi-parameter families of relative equilibria, whereas the aforementioned works obtain only curves of relative equilibria. The main results of this part are contained in a submitted paper. The second part of the thesis extends the results of the first part by treating the case when the principal stratum of the action has non-trivial symmetry, that is, each point on this stratum has symmetry conjugate to a non-trivial subgroup of G. The main result of this part is the existence of symmetry breaking bifurcating branches of relative equilibria with principal symmetry emanating from the set t · qe. As opposed to the situation in the first part, the amended potential criterion along the emanating branches is not applicable anymore, because each point on such a branch has nontrivial isotropy. Thus we shall use the augmented potential and the same type of techniques as in the first part to treat branches with non-trivial isotropy. However, we can obtain only bifurcating curves of relative equilibria and not multi-parameter families; we lose the explicit dependence on the momentum value along the bifurcating branch. The last part of the thesis investigates the problem of symmetry breaking in the framework of dynamical systems with symmetry on a smooth manifold. The symmetric steady state and Hopf bifurcations are considered. First, it is shown how to locally translate these symmetry breaking problems to similar ones on a vector space. This presents several advantages because of the availability of techniques specific to the linear case, such as invariant theory, where one uses the existence of a Hilbert basis of invariant polynomials for representations of compact Lie groups. Several results in the literature give then sufficient conditions for the existence of symmetry breaking bifurcations. The same method is then used in the Hamiltonian context to find sufficient conditions for the existence of symmetry breaking bifurcation. The Hamilltonian steady state (passing of eigenvalues of the linearization on the imaginary axis at the origin) and the Hamiltonian Hopf bifurcations are analyzed. This is achieved by noting that in the Hamiltonian context one can work only with invariant polynomials of the action and ignore the equivariant polynomials. In addition, it is shown how to locally translate the bifurcation problem from the manifold to the tangent space at the bifurcation point. This is done by using the equivariant Darboux theorem...|$|E
40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common hip joint {{diseases}} and with increasing age and obesity, the prevalence of OA is likely to become even higher. Many patients with end-stage hip OA are treated with total hip arthroplasty (THA). As the number of THA surgeries is increasing, also the number of revision surgeries is growing. To prevent bone-implant interface failure, it is important to detect and monitor patients at risk, in which the loading on the hip joint is very important. Besides that, mechanical factors, e. g. joint loading, are a risk factor for OA. However, most often hip pathology patients are evaluated using clinical measures, like abductor strength and dislocation rate, or in terms of kinematics and joint moments that only represent external loading and do not take into account any internal forces, like muscle forces. Hip contact forces are typically used to quantify internal hip joint loading. This measure accounts for the joint loading determined by the external forces, e. g. ground reaction forces, as well as internal forces, e. g. muscle forces. Hip contact forces can be measured using instrumented hip prostheses. A dataset containing measured hip contact forces of different subjects has previously been made publicly available. Although these instrumented hip prostheses provide a direct measure of hip contact forces, these measurements are rare and limited to subjects that received a THA. To be able to determine hip loading non-invasively in other subject groups, musculoskeletal modelling in combination with three dimensional motion analysis data, can be used to calculate hip contact forces in vivo. These model-based contact forces have been validated against measured contact forces from instrumented prostheses. Several studies show an overestimation of calculated hip contact forces compared to measured forces, while others find more comparable results. Different modelling choices, like including subject-specific detail and the use of different optimization methods to calculate muscle forces can contribute to the reported overestimation of calculated contact forces compared to measured forces. Also differences in movement kinematics and kinetics, based on which hip contact forces are calculated, will affect contact forces. It is important to consider the contribution of all of these factors when assessing the validity of calculated hip contact forces against a measured dataset. The aim of this PhD aim is twofold. First, the sensitivity of the calculated hip contact forces for specific aspects of the musculoskeletal modelling and dynamic simulation workflow is evaluated. Second, once the factors that influence calculated hip contact forces most are identified, insights are used to investigate hip loading in hip pathology patients. This results in the following research topics: Evaluate the effect of including different levels of subject-specific detail in musculoskeletal models on hip joint loading (studies I, II and III). Evaluate the effect of the optimization technique on calculated muscle and contact forces (study IV). Evaluate the effect of different gait patterns on hip joint loading (studies V and VI). Evaluate hip function in OA and THA patients (studies VII and VIII). The first four studies investigate the sensitivity of the calculated hip contact forces for different aspects of the musculoskeletal modelling workflow. In study I, we investigated the relative importance of including subject-specific geometrical detail in the musculoskeletal model versus the effect of an altered cost function definition on hip contact forces for healthy control subjects. We used computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to create seven model types that each contained a different level of subject-specific detail and simulated gait. Hip contact forces were calculated on the one hand using the standard simulation workflow and analyses implemented in OpenSim. On the other hand, the effect of including a term minimizing the hip contact forces in the optimization criterion underlying muscle force calculation was investigated. Results showed that inclusion of subject-specific detail had a dominant effect on the calculated hip contact forces, although the effect of the level of subject-specific detail varied. The MRI-based model that included subject-specific muscle paths and wrapping surfaces, to account for the effect of the hip capsule, resulted in contact forces that were most comparable to measured hip contact forces, both in magnitude and orientation. To generalize the effect of the subject-specific wrapping surfaces, the generic model was updated to include average MRI-based wrapping surfaces. The use of this model also brought contact forces closer to experimental values, but the effect was less pronounced compared to the MRI-based models. Including minimization of the hip contact forces into the cost function (SOmin) had only a limited effect on the contact forces. Specifically, the largest overestimations were not affected. Nevertheless, for the generic model, contact forces decreased on average more by using SOmin than by including wrapping surfaces, but the largest overestimations of the contact forces were not decreased. Therefore, inclusion of subject-specific geometrical detail in the model had a greater effect than altering the cost function definition. The effect of including subject-specific detail in the musculoskeletal model on hip contact forces was also investigated in hip OA and THA patients in study II. Besides that, the effect of subject-specific moment generating capacity of the musculoskeletal model was investigated for healthy control subjects as well as OA and THA patients. For all subjects a generic scaled and MRI model was created as well as the respective models including wrapping surfaces and gait was simulated. Maximal isometric muscle forces in the model were on the one hand statically scaled based on dynamometer measurements. On the other hand, muscle forces were functionally scaled based on the external joint moments required during gait and stair ascent and descent, an approach already successfully adopted for the knee. Static scaling decreased the maximal isometric muscle forces of control, OA and THA subjects and for all model types. As a result, the model lacked the capacity to generate the internal joint moments measured during functional activities, hence further results, i. e. hip contact forces, cannot be reliably calculated. Functional scaling decreased muscle forces less or even increased muscle forces compared to the unscaled models. Hip contact forces were comparable to the unscaled models. For THA patients, including MRI-based information decreased hip contact forces, specifically by including wrapping surfaces around the hip joint, as was also reported for control subjects in study I. For OA patients, changes in hip contact forces were less pronounced. The deviations of muscle generated moments from internal joint moments of the MRI-based models were not excessively increased compared to the generic model with unscaled muscle forces. This indicates that including MRI-based geometrical detail, without scaling muscle forces, results in a model that is strong enough to perform the measured functional tasks while hip contact forces are more comparable to measured hip contact forces. The importance of estimating body segment parameters (BSP) when calculating joint moments and muscle forces during gait was examined in study III. The segment mass, centre of mass (com) and <b>inertial</b> <b>tensor</b> of the left thigh, shank and foot were adjusted from 60 % to 140 % of the nominal value in steps of 10 % both individually as well as for different combinations of BSP values. We found only a limited effect of BSP perturbation on inverse dynamics. The largest effect was found by perturbing the shank com. Further, the additional influence of a combined perturbation of parameters was only very small. On the other hand, muscle forces calculated using computed muscle control (CMC) were largely affected by changes in BSP, which resulted from the underlying forward integration. Indeed, post hoc analyses indicated that when using static optimization, a technique that is not based on forward integration, muscle forces were less affected by perturbations in BSP. In study IV, we investigated the effect of different optimization techniques on calculated muscle forces and the magnitude and orientation of resultant hip contact forces for gait and sit to stand using a scaled generic musculoskeletal model. To calculate muscle forces, four different optimization techniques were used, i. e. two different static optimization techniques (SO 1 and SO 2), computed muscle control (CMC) and the physiological inverse approach (PIA), after which muscle and hip contact forces were calculated. Both static optimization techniques showed the lowest hip contact forces for both gait and sit to stand. The additional constraints to include a physiological increase and decrease of muscle activation in time and the inclusion of passive muscle forces (SO 2) did not majorly affect the hip contact forces compared to a standard SO formulation (SO 1). In contrast, hip contact forces increased drastically when using CMC. These increased contact forces from CMC were potentially caused by higher muscle forces resulting from co-contraction of agonists and antagonists around the hip or the slightly poorer tracking of the net joint moment by the muscle moments. On the other hand, hip contact forces between the SO techniques and PIA were similar, which showed that the activation and contraction dynamics can be integrated without inducing an excessive overestimation of the hip contact forces as observed by CMC. The first four studies showed that the inclusion of subject-specific geometrical detail in the musculoskeletal model is most important in calculating hip contact forces. The muscle optimization technique, including minimization of the hip contact force into the cost function and subject-specific maximal isometric muscle forces all affect hip contact forces to a lesser extent. In the following four studies we investigated hip loading in hip pathology patients. In study V, we evaluated to what extent hip and pelvis kinematics can affect hip contact forces and aimed to identify gait patterns that can be used to effectively influence hip contact forces. In patients with knee OA, the relation between joint loading and kinematics has already been established and is used to deliberately reduce knee contact forces. For the hip, we therefore investigated the relation between hip contact forces and joint moments to determine whether hip contact forces can be estimated using external joint moments, as this is a more widely available parameter in clinical gait laboratories. We therefore systematically imposed perturbations on hip and pelvis kinematics. The hip adduction, rotation and flexion angles as well as the pelvis obliquity angle were perturbed by ± 5 °, both individually and in combination (resulting in 405 simulations, 81 simulations for each subject). The results showed that a change in frontal plane hip and pelvis kinematics had a dominant effect on the magnitude of hip contact forces. To decrease hip contact forces, the hip adduction angle should be decreased, while an increase in hip adduction will effectively increase the hip contact forces. Results also showed that the changes in hip contact forces were related to changes in hip moments, indicating that the hip adduction moment can be used to predict the contact forces independent of the specific kinematic strategy. However, at the second peak in hip contact force both the hip adduction and flexion moments are required to accurately predict hip contact forces. Therefore, gait training that focuses on decreasing hip adduction moments has the largest potential to reduce hip contact forces independent of the kinematic strategy used. On the other hand, increasing hip adduction moments has the largest potential to increase hip contact forces. Besides that the magnitude of the hip contact force is affected, also the orientation changes. Therefore, in study VI the effect of kinematics on the risk of antero-superior edge loading was investigated. We used the same synthetic dataset as for study V and assumed a prosthesis cup was placed within Lewinnek’s safe zone and calculated the angle between the edge of the cup and the hip contact force vector (HCF-edge angle). In addition to the effect of altered kinematics, also the effect of 4 different cup positions (an inclination angle of 30 ° and 50 ° and anteversion angle of 5 ° and 25 °) and 2 different coverage angles (180 ° and 168 °) was evaluated. Results showed that factors related to the implant position and design largely affect edge loading. For cup positions within Lewinnek’s safe zone, a small anteversion angle (5 °) never resulted in edge loading, while increased cup anteversion and inclination resulted in the smallest HCF-edge angles, indicative of edge loading. Although the analysis evaluated cups within the safe zone, several gait patterns and even some unperturbed gait patterns, presented a risk of edge loading. Also the coverage angle influenced edge loading, where a coverage angle of 168 ° increased the risk of edge loading. Apart from implant related factors, gait kinematics also affected the risk of edge loading. This is clinically relevant as gait kinematics are the sole factor that can be altered after THA to prevent edge loading. The risk of edge loading depended on the phase in the gait cycle. At initial double support there was no risk of edge loading for any of the imposed gait patterns. The highest risk of edge loading was found during terminal double support. Increased hip abduction, resulting in decreased hip contact force magnitude, and decreased hip extension, resulting in decreased risk on edge loading, were defined as gait strategies that could prevent edge loading. For studies VII and VIII, the workflow for the calculation of hip contact forces in patients with hip pathology was optimized based on the previous studies and the effect of hip pathology related kinematics on hip contact forces was analysed. In these studies the generic model including wrapping surfaces was used, based on studies I and II. Based on study IV, a static optimization was used to calculate muscle forces. In study VII a detailed analysis of the hip kinematics, kinetics, work, power, muscle activity and hip joint loading in OA patients was performed. The aim of this study was to define a detailed mechanical profile of patients with hip OA. Patients with hip OA and healthy control subjects performed gait analysis including electromyography (EMG) measurements. Kinematics, kinetics, work, power, as well as hip contact forces were calculated. Specifically frontal plane changes were found in patients with hip OA. Patients walked with reduced hip adduction angles and abduction moments as well as decreased power in the frontal plane. Also a large decrease in positive work of the hip abductors, representative for m. gluteus medius weakness, was found. Given the reported decrease in frontal plane power, the relative increase in muscle activity may reflect abductor muscle weakness. Furthermore, patients presented with reduced walking velocity and decreased maximal hip extension. The hip contact forces showed reduced hip loading in patients with hip OA, presenting reduced hip contact forces both at the first and second peak. This coincided with reduced hip adduction angles, hip abduction moments and frontal plane power. At the second peak, hip contact forces were even more reduced and coincided with the reduced hip flexion moment. Study V also showed that these gait strategies resulted in decreased hip loading. As a result of the adopted kinetic strategy, not only the magnitude of the hip contact forces decreased. The hip loading direction was also found to be more vertical in the sagittal and frontal plane, but more medial in the transversal plane. Overall, insights into compensatory mechanisms in hip OA patients were obtained, and the biomechanical strategies observed in these patients resulted in a decrease in hip loading. Study VIII evaluated the differences in hip joint loading between different surgical hip arthroplasty procedures, the direct anterior (DAA), direct lateral (DLA) and posterolateral (PLA) approaches in patients one year or more after surgery. The DAA is expected to result in reduced muscle damage and abductor dysfunction, which might result in a hip loading which is more comparable to healthy control subjects. Patients operated via the DAA received a THA, while DLA and PLA patients received a resurfacing hip arthroplasty (RHA). Gait trials were collected for all subjects. For control subjects and DAA patients also stair ascent and descent trials were collected, as these tasks are expected to better distinguish between groups. Results showed no differences between the patient groups one year or more after surgery. However, patients did show aberrant hip loading compared to healthy controls. In gait differences in hip contact forces were specifically found at terminal double support. Limited differences between controls and DAA patients were found during stair ascent and descent. Interestingly, the magnitude of the hip contact force was not larger for stair ascent and descent than for gait. This indicates that stair ascent and descent cannot be labelled as higher demanding tasks than gait in terms of magnitude of hip loading. In contrast, hip loading orientation did discriminate between DAA patients and controls during stair ascent (presenting a more vertical loading in DAA patients) and descent (presenting a more anterior loading in DAA patients). Since in gait no differences in load orientation were found between controls and patients, this might indicate that stair ascent and descent are more demanding when considering the load orientation. All these studies showed that hip pathology patients, both OA and hip arthroplasty patients, adopt a gait strategy that decreases hip loading. Besides that, we were able to identify gait strategies that affect the magnitude of hip loading, e. g. decreased loading by decreasing the hip adduction moment, and reduce the risk on edge loading, by decreasing hip extension. Overall, this PhD contributed to insights on several important factors affecting the calculation of hip contact forces. The insights resulted in the creation of a musculoskeletal model that included wrapping surfaces around the hip joint to include the effect of the hip capsule on the muscle paths. Insights of the first studies were used to optimize the workflow for calculating hip contact forces in patients with hip OA and after THA. These studies are relevant to be able to monitor hip loading in patients, which in future research can be used to investigate stresses and strains in bone and cartilage. nrpages: 274 status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Inertial flow in porous media {{occurs in}} many {{situations}} of practical relevance among which one can cite flows in column reactors, in filters, in aquifers, or near wells for hydrocarbon recovery. It {{is characterized by a}} deviation from Darcy’s law that leads to a nonlinear relationship between the pressure drop and the filtration velocity. In this work, this deviation, also known as the nonlinear, inertial, correction to Darcy’s law, which is subject to controversy upon its origin and dependence on the filtration velocity, is studied through numerical simulations. First, the microscopic flow problem was solved computationally {{for a wide range of}} Reynolds numbers up to the limit of steady flow within ordered and disordered porous structures. In a second step, the macroscopic characteristics of the porous medium and flow (permeability and <b>inertial</b> correction <b>tensors)</b> that appear in the macroscale model were computed. From these results, different flow regimes were identified: (1) the weak inertia regime where the inertial correction has a cubic dependence on the filtration velocity and (2) the strong inertia (Forchheimer) regime where the inertial correction depends on the square of the filtration velocity. However, the existence and origin of those regimes, which depend also on the microstructure and flow orientation, are still not well understood in terms of their physical interpretations, as many causes have been conjectured in the literature. In the present study, we provide an in-depth analysis of the flow structure to identify the origin of the deviation from Darcy’s law. For accuracy and clarity purposes, this is carried out on two-dimensional structures. Unlike the previous studies reported in the literature, where the origin of inertial effects is often identified on a heuristic basis, a theoretical ustification is presented in this work. Indeed, a decomposition of the convective inertial term into two components is carried out formally allowing the identification of a correlation between the flow structure and the different inertial regimes. These components correspond to the curvature of the flow streamlines weighted by the local fluid kinetic energy on the one hand and the distribution of the kinetic energy along these lines on the other hand. In addition, the role of the recirculation zones in the occurrence and in the form of the deviation from Darcy’s law was thoroughly analyzed. For the porous structures under consideration, it is shown that (1) the kinetic energy lost in the vortices is insignificant even at high filtration velocities and (2) the shape of the flow streamlines induced by the recirculation zones plays an important role in the variation of the flow structure, which is correlated itself to the different flow regimes...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{analyses}} {{the dynamics}} of a suspension of heavy particles in shear flow. The magnitude of the particle inertia is given by the Stokes number St = m(gamma/ 6 (pi) a, which is {{the ratio of the}} viscous relaxation time of a particle tau(sub p) = m= 6 pi(eta) a to the flow time gamma(sup - 1). Here, m is the mass of the particle, a is its size, eta is the viscosity of the suspending fluid and gamma is the shear rate. The ratio of the Stokes number to the Reynolds number, Re = (rho) f(gamma) a(exp 2) /eta, is the density ratio rho(sub p) /rho(sub f). Of interest is to understand the separate roles of particle (St) and fluid (Re) inertia in {{the dynamics of}} suspensions. In this study we focus on heavy particles, rho(sub p) /rho(sub f) much greater than 1, for which the Stokes number is finite, but the Reynolds number is sufficiently small for inertial forces in the fluid to be neglected; thus, the fluid motion is governed by the Stokes equations. On the other hand, the probability density governing the statistics of the suspended particles satisfies a Fokker-Planck equation that accounts for both configuration and momentum coordinates, the latter being essential for finite St. The solution of the Fokker-Planck equation is obtained to O(St) via a Chapman-Enskog type-procedure, and the conditional velocity distribution so obtained is used to derive a configuration-space Smoluchowski equation with inertial corrections. The inertial effects are responsible for asymmetry in the relative trajectories of two spheres in shear flow, in contrast to the well known symmetric structure in the absence of inertia. Finite St open trajectories in the plane of shear suffer a downward lateral displacement resulting from the inability of a particle of finite mass to follow the curvature of the zero-Stokes-number pathlines. In addition to the induced asymmetry, the O(St) inertial perturbation dramatically alters the nature of the near-field trajectories. The stable closed orbits (for St = 0) in the plane of shear now spiral in, approaching particle-particle contact in the limit. All trajectories starting from an initial offset of O(St(sup 1 / 2) or less (which remain open for St = 0) also spiral in. The asymmetry of the trajectories leads to a non-Newtonian rheology and diffusive behavior. The latter because a given particle (moving along a finite St open trajectory) suffers a net displacement in the transverse direction after a single interaction. A sequence of such uncorrelated displacements leads to the particle executing a random walk. The <b>inertial</b> diffusivity <b>tensor</b> is anisotropic on account of differing strengths of interaction in the gradient and vorticity directions. Since the entire region (constituting an in finite area) of closed orbits in the plane of shear spirals onto contact for #finite St, the latter represents a singular surface for the pair-distribution function. The exact form of the pair-distribution function at contact is still, however, indeterminate in the absence of non-hydrodynamic effects. It {{should also be noted that}} finite St non-rectilinear flows do not support a spatially uniform number density owing to the cross-streamline inertial migration of particles...|$|R
