5|$|When Häyhänen {{announced}} {{himself at}} the embassy on 4 May, he appeared drunk. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officials at the Paris embassy did not find Häyhänen's story credible. They weren't convinced he might actually be a Russian spy until he produced a hollow Finnish 5-mark coin. Upon opening the coin a square of microfilm was revealed. On May 11, the CIA returned him to the United States and handed <b>him</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> FBI. As {{a member of a}} Soviet spy ring operating on American soil, Häyhänen came under the FBI's jurisdiction and they began verifying his story.|$|E

5|$|From 1642, Charles {{fought the}} armies of the English and Scottish parliaments in the English Civil War. After his defeat in 1645, he {{surrendered}} to a Scottish force that eventually handed <b>him</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> English Parliament. Charles refused to accept his captors' demands for a constitutional monarchy, and temporarily escaped captivity in November 1647. Re-imprisoned on the Isle of Wight, Charles forged an alliance with Scotland, {{but by the end}} of 1648 Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army had consolidated its control over England. Charles was tried, convicted, and executed for high treason in January 1649. The monarchy was abolished and a republic called the Commonwealth of England was declared. The monarchy was restored to Charles's son, Charles II, in 1660.|$|E
5|$|Rhys had {{nominated}} {{his eldest}} legitimate son, Gruffydd ap Rhys, as his successor, {{and soon after}} his father's death Gruffydd met the Justiciar, Archbishop Hubert Walter, on the border and was confirmed as heir. Maelgwn, the eldest son but illegitimate, refused to accept this and was given military assistance by Gwenwynwyn ab Owain of Powys. Maelgwn took the town and castle of Aberystwyth and captured Gruffydd, whom he {{handed over to the}} custody of Gwenwynwyn. Gwenwynwyn later handed <b>him</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> king, who imprisoned him at Corfe Castle. Gruffydd was set free the following year and regained most of Ceredigion. In 1201 Gruffydd died, but this did not end the fighting between rival claimants. In 1216 Llywelyn the Great of Gwynedd held a council at Aberdyfi where he allocated parts of Deheubarth to several sons and grandsons of Rhys.|$|E
5|$|The Hohenstaufen's grip on power, however, was not secure. WalterIII of Brienne {{had married}} the {{daughter}} of Tancred of Sicily. She was sister and heiress of the deposed King William III of Sicily. In 1201 William decided to claim the kingdom. In 1202, an army led by the chancellor Walter of Palearia and Dipold of Vohburg was defeated by Walter III of Brienne. Markward was killed, and Frederick fell {{under the control of}} William of Capparone, an ally of the Pisans. Dipold continued the war against Walter on the mainland until the claimant's death in 1205. Dipold finally wrested Frederick from Capparone in 1206 and gave <b>him</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> guardianship of the chancellor, Walter of Palearia. Walter and Dipold then had a falling out, and the latter captured the royal palace, where he was besieged and captured by Walter in 1207. After a decade, the wars over the regency and the throne itself had ceased.|$|E

5|$|The crusade {{ended with}} the catastrophic defeat of the crusaders in the Battle of Varna on 10 November 1444. After the battle Hunyadi wanted to return to Hungary through Wallachia, but he was {{captured}} by Wallachian soldiers at the Danube. Vlad only released him after Lawrence Héderváry, Palatine of Hungary, threatened him with a war. According to historian John Jefferson, Vlad held Hunyadi in captivity {{because he wanted to}} hand <b>him</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sultan. Camil Mureşanu writes that Hunyadi was only imprisoned because the soldiers who captured him did not recognize him. Historian Kurt W. Teptow says, Vlad held Hunyadi responsible for the catastrophe and almost killed him. After releasing Hunyadi, Vlad gave him precious gifts and accompanied him as far as the Hungarian border.|$|E
5|$|The revolutionaries started {{negotiations}} with the Chinese government through James Dietrich, who held Sun Yat-sen's power of attorney, to buy a million rifles. However, the deal fell through when it was realised that the weapons offered were obsolete flintlocks and muzzle loaders. From China, Gupta went to Japan to try to procure arms and to enlist Japanese support for the Indian independence movement. However, he was forced into hiding within 48 hours {{when he came to}} know that the Japanese authorities planned to hand <b>him</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British. Later reports indicated he was protected at this time by Toyama Mitsuru right-wing political leader and founder of the Genyosha nationalist secret society.|$|E
5|$|Captain Hayes, {{unable to}} reach the MTB, had started {{swimming}} away from the shooting, and came ashore beside Asnieres-en-Bessin. He managed to evade capture and made contact with a local French family who provided him with civilian clothing and contacted the French resistance. Hayes was taken by train to Lisieux and after several weeks reached Paris. Hayes was moved along an escape line to the Spanish border, arriving in October 1942. After crossing into Spain he was stopped by Spanish border guards who handed <b>him</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Germans. Hayes was returned to Paris and imprisoned in Fresnes prison. He was kept in solitary confinement for nine months before being executed by firing squad on 13 July 1943. Hayes had landed in uniform {{and should have been}} considered a prisoner of war, but he was executed following the issue of the commando order which called for the execution of all commandos upon capture. It was discovered after the war that Hayes had been betrayed to the Germans, who were aware of all his movements from Normandy to the Spanish border. The persons believed responsible for Hayes' betrayal were never punished, as they convinced the authorities they were acting as double agents.|$|E

5|$|In 1216, after {{requesting}} Muhammad II of Khwarazm not to aid Kuchlug, Genghis Khan dispatched general Jebe {{with two}} tumens (20,000 soldiers) {{to deal with}} the Qara Khitai threat, while sending Subutai with another two tumens on a simultaneous campaign against the Merkits. The two armies traveled alongside each other through the Altai and Tarbagatai Mountains until arriving at Almaliq. At that point, Subutai turned southwest, destroying the Merkits and protecting Jebe's flank against any sudden attacks from Khwarazm. Jebe relieved Almaliq, then moved south of Lake Balkash into the lands of the Qara Khitai, where he besieged the capital of Balasagun. There, Jebe defeated an army of 30,000 troops and Kuchlug fled to Kashgar. Taking advantage of the unrest fomenting under Kuchlug's rule, Jebe gained support from the Muslim populace by announcing that Kuchlug's policy of religious persecution had ended. When Jebe's army arrived at Kashgar in 1217, the populace revolted and turned on Kuchlug, forcing him to flee for his life. Jebe pursued Kuchlug across the Pamir Mountains into Badakhshan in modern Afghanistan. According to Ata-Malik Juvayni, a group of hunters caught Kuchlug and handed <b>him</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Mongols, who promptly beheaded him.|$|E

With the initial help of elderly gunslinger Landon Ricketts (Ross Hagen), Marston, along with rebel leader Abraham Reyes (Josh Segarra) {{and one of his}} lovers Luisa (Francesca Galeas), eventually turns the tide in favour of the rebels, killing de Santa and launching an assault on the El Presidio fortress. They find Escuella, who attempts to bargain for his life by revealing that Williamson has been under Allende's protection. Marston is given the option to either kill Escuella or turn <b>him</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bureau.

In charge of the attempt to capture Zacharias was Seremet, who had been instructed to capture Zacharias and hand <b>him</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> higher authorities.|$|E
