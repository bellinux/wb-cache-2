The film opens with an intimate scene between Andula and her fellow shoe-factory-worker friend as they lie <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> their dormitory discussing the ring given to Andula by her boyfriend Tonda and gossiping about her mildly flirtatious encounter with a forest ranger, which is shown in flashback.|$|E

25|$|The {{gas line}} {{from the back of}} the house's furnace had been pulled out in an attempt to conceal {{evidence}} of the homicide. The accumulating gas was later ignited by a candle that Fisher had allegedly lit, waiting for the gas to accumulate and descend to the flame hours after being lit. This delayed fuse would have given Fisher an approximate 10 hour head start in his successful attempt to evade law enforcement. Burned bodies of a woman and two children were found lying <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> the remains of the burnt out house. They were identified as Mary (age 38), and her two children, Brittney (age 12) and Bobby (age 10). Investigators have theorized that Fisher murdered his family because he felt threatened by Mary's intent to divorce him, and didn't want his children to go through what he did as a child.|$|E

25|$|In 1911, Mizoguchi's parents, {{too poor}} to {{continue}} paying for their son's primary school training, sent him to stay with an uncle in Morioka, in northern Japan, for a year - a period that saw the onset of crippling rheumatoid arthritis that was to afflict him during adolescence and leave him with a lop-sided walking gait {{for the rest of}} his life. The year 1912, back with his parents, was spent almost entirely <b>in</b> <b>bed.</b> <b>In</b> 1913 Mizoguchi's sister Suzu secured him work as an apprentice, designing patterns for kimonos and yukatas. In 1915 his mother died, and Suzu brought her younger brothers into her own house and looked after them. In 1916 he enrolled for a course at the Aoibashi Yoga Kenkyuko art school in Tokyo, which taught Western painting techniques. At this time too he pursued a new interest in opera, particularly at the Royal Theatre at Akasaka where he began, in due course, to help the set decorators.|$|E
25|$|At {{that time}} Ivar Kreuger {{was in the}} United States and was asked to return to Europe {{for a meeting with}} the {{chairman}} of the Riksbank, Ivar Rooth. He had left Sweden for the last time on November 23, 1931 and returned to Europe on the ship Ile de France, arriving in Paris on March 11, 1932. The meeting with Ivar Rooth was scheduled to take place on March 13 or 14 in Berlin. He met with Krister Littorin (vice president of Kreuger & Toll holding) and his own banker Oscar Rydbeck in Paris on March 11 to prepare for the Berlin meeting. But on March 12, he was found dead <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> his apartment at Avenue Victor Emanuel III. After questioning Kreuger's servants (his French maid, Mademoiselle Barrault, and the janitor who had had contact with Kreuger in the morning) the French police and a physician {{came to the conclusion that}} he had shot himself some time between 10:45a.m. and 12:10p.m. A 9-mm semi-automatic gun was found on the bed beside the body.|$|E

At {{the end of the}} episode, Burns is lying <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> a body cast, chewing loudly and pausing his speech for Smithers to spoon-feed him, as in A Clockwork Orange when a bedridden Alex is spoonfed steak.

500|$|The book reprints one of David's most quoted sentences, first {{printed in}} Vogue in 1959, and {{included}} in Is there a Nutmeg in the House in 2000: [...] "If I had my way – and I shan't – my Christmas Day {{eating and drinking}} would consist of an omelette and cold ham and a nice bottle of wine at lunchtime, and a smoked salmon sandwich {{with a glass of}} champagne on a tray <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> the evening." [...] The pattern of the book follows that of earlier ones, with recipes interspersed with more discursive essays on subjects such as avocado pears, persimmons, historical menus, and Christmas hampers, and extracts from prose by writers whom David admired, including Sybille Bedford and George Eliot.|$|E
500|$|Containing a vague plot, {{the opening}} scene of the clip {{features}} Usher donning a black tank top and dark jeans, while he stands in a field with the sun rising in the background.

[...] Appearing alongside his interest in the backdrop scenes, Usher then sings propped on a concrete wall in a dark alley, while he and the woman tease each other, before moving outside on the balcony of a house on top of mountains. The singer performs acrobatic moves, including one in particular in which he does a pull-up onto the roof to kiss his partner. All previous scenes are intercut before culminating with Usher seducing his partner <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>in</b> racy moments with Usher in nothing but briefs as he pulls off her stockings. The final scene sees the singer driving off in a convertible.|$|E

(Sheen is scarily good at this.)" [...] In 2014, he starred in the fantasy children's film Mariah Mundi and the Midas Box. R.

500|$|Biden's Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized {{again in}} 2013. The act led to further related {{developments}} {{in the creation of}} the White House Council on Women and Girls, begun in the first term, as well as the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault, begun in January 2014 with Biden as co-chair along with Jarrett. Biden has a strong stance on sexual assault. For example, Biden stated to a victim of sexual assault at Stanford University, [...] "you did it... in the hope that your strength might prevent this crime from happening to someone else. Your bravery is breathtaking." [...] He has also taken legality into the situation. Biden issued federal guidelines while presenting a speech at the University of New Hampshire. He stated that, [...] "No means no, if you're drunk or you're sober. No means no if you're <b>in</b> <b>bed,</b> <b>in</b> a dorm or on the street.

500|$|Aside from this, however, Madonna {{also wanted}} to explore the British club musical scene, where genres such as dub had been growing in popularity. In such a way, she decided to work with several European {{producers}} and composers within the electronic scene, including Nellee Hooper, who pleased Madonna due to his [...] "very European sensibility". Inviting Hooper over to Los Angeles, sessions started {{taking place in the}} Chappell Studios of Encino, California. Björk accepted the offer to write a track for Madonna's album, and wrote a song initially named [...] "Let's Get Unconscious". Once the song demo had been finished, Hooper and Marius De Vries rearranged the track and the final version was called [...] "Bedtime Story", which became the album's third single. Academic Georges Claude Guilbert, author of Madonna As Postmodern Myth, felt that the album's title was a pun; [...] " [...] is referring to (possible erotic) stories told at bedtime (<b>in</b> <b>bed).</b> <b>In</b> a way (the album) is really a book of stories you can tell your kids at bedtime [...] sexuality explained to children [...] Madonna has always thought that children should be better informed in that aspect".|$|E

[...] At first the gardens were managed by a private agent on behalf of the residents, but a committee of residents took over responsibity in 1872. The 19th-century German philosopher Arnold Ruge lived at number 7 and was chairman of the Park Crescent Residents' Association. Lewis Carroll's sister Henrietta moved to number 4 Park Crescent in 1885 and lived a hermit-like existence with several cats for company. [...] She died in 1922. In 1934, number 44 was the site of the second notorious [...] "Brighton trunk murder" [...] {{in the space of a}} few weeks. On 15 July that year, the body of Violet Kaye, a prostitute, was found in a suitcase in a house in Kemp Street in the North Laine area.

500|$|The last of {{the books}} planned by David was Elizabeth David's Christmas (2003). She and Norman had {{discussed}} such a book {{as early as the}} 1970s, but work on other projects precluded it. After David's death, Norman found when sorting out the author's papers that David had written and compiled far more material on a Christmas theme than anyone else had realised. The Christmas recipes David had most often been asked for formed the core of the book. Together with some Christmas recipes from Mediterranean Food, French Provincial Cooking, and Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen, and revised articles published in previous years in magazines, they were turned into a 214-page work. The chapters dealt with the social and historical side of Christmas, first courses and cold meats, soups, poultry and game, meat, vegetables and salads, sauces, pickles and chutneys, and desserts, cakes and drinks. The book reprints one of David's most quoted sentences, first printed in Vogue in 1959, and included in Is there a Nutmeg in the House in 2000: [...] "If I had my way—and I shan't—my Christmas Day eating and drinking would consist of an omelette and cold ham and a nice bottle of wine at lunchtime, and a smoked salmon sandwich with a glass of champagne on a tray <b>in</b> <b>bed</b> <b>in</b> the evening." ...|$|E

[...] Joe learns what a baby learns: the comforting {{presence}} of his mother, the presence of another figure, who does not smell as nice, and who always leaves as soon as he picks up his black bag. [...] Joe is seen as a baby and then not again as a child; the audience takes his perspective. [...] Joe's Grandma notices him trying to walk, calls for Marjorie to witness the first steps, and once he takes them, as the chorus states, [...] "the world belongs to Joe" [...] ("One Foot, Other Foot"). [...] Joe grows to school age, and loses his beloved Grandma. [...] He is comforted by Jennie Brinker, a businessman's daughter. [...] The two grow to high school age and date, though Joe lacks the nerve to kiss her, to Jennie's frustration. [...] As Joe prepares to leave for college, Dr. Taylor hopes that his son will help him in his medical practice, and he and Marjorie wonder if Joe will marry Jennie ("A Fellow Needs a Girl").|$|E
