30|$|Mussel {{individuals}} were cultured within 17  m water column depth, on mussel-growing ropes of 12  m in length. Mussel ropes hung from 5  m headline depth, with a distance between ropes of 0.5  m and an initial stocking density of 681  ±  37 individuals per lineal meter. After 13  months of cultivation, in July 2014, 200 mussel specimens of “commercial size” (Peteiro et al. 2006, i.e., 70  mm) were carefully {{detached from the}} ropes by cutting the byssal threads and cleaned of encrusting organisms. Selected mussel {{individuals were}} transported in plastic self-draining boxes covered by <b>flaked</b> <b>ice.</b> Later in the laboratory, mussels were conserved in plastic boxes, stored at 4  °C and covered with <b>flaked</b> <b>ice</b> for 24  h previous to analysis to preserve them. Similarly, 200 mussel individuals from Ría de Arosa (Galician Region; Spain) with a comparative commercial size (69.65  ±  6.11  mm) were obtained at early hours {{on the morning of}} the day of the sensory analysis. Commercial mussels were bought from a local seafood retailer to ensure a comparable size product with the same conservation procedure (plastic box and stored at 4  °C). These mussels were also stored at 4  °C and covered with <b>flaked</b> <b>ice</b> for some hours previous to analysis. Subsequently, two stocks of 50 mussel individuals from Galicia and from the experimental open ocean site were frozen at − 80  °C to await morphometric and biochemical analysis.|$|R
40|$|Slurry ice is a biphasic system {{consisting}} of small spherical ice crystals surrounded by seawater at subzero temperature. Its employment was evaluated {{in the present}} work as a new chilled storage method for whole European hake (Merluccius merluccius) and compared to traditional <b>flake</b> <b>icing.</b> Different chemical analyses (nucleotide degradation, formaldehyde formation, lipid hydrolysis and oxidation, interaction compounds formation and electrophoretic protein profiles) related to quality changes were analysed and compared to sensory evaluation. An inhibitory effect on quality loss mechanisms was observed for the slurry ice treatment, according to nucleotide degradation (K value), free formaldehyde content, browning development and sarcoplasmic protein profiles. No differences in lipid hydrolysis and oxidation could be outlined by comparison between both icing conditions. The sensory analysis showed a higher shelf-life time for slurry <b>icing</b> than <b>flake</b> <b>icing</b> (12 days and 5 days, respectively). Results confirm the practical advantages of using slurry ice as a chilling storage method...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the effect on the}} quality of deepwater pink shrimp (Parapenaeus longirostris) of onboard chilling with liquid ice versus the traditional chilling with <b>flaked</b> <b>ice.</b> Quality was estimated by physical, chemical, microbiological and sensory parameters after 24 h and 4 days of chilled storage. Application of liquid ice immediately after catch for the fast chilling of pink shrimp reduced the formation of nitrogenous compounds and slowed down the increase in pH and the development of microorganisms during iced storage. On the other hand, texture (breaking force, hardness and elasticity) showed only minor changes. Pink shrimp chilled with liquid ice showed, however, loss of characteristic bright colours and development of dull tones in the carapace that depreciates the product's commercial value. Nevertheless, application of liquid ice onboard was advantageous over the utilization of the traditional type of ice, and seems particularly applicable when shrimp is {{to be used as a}} raw material for the type of processing that requires elimination of the carapace. © Springer-Verlag 2002.

40|$|The {{basic science}} {{responsible}} for the fascinating shapes of ice crystals and snowflakes is still not understood. Insufficient knowledge of the interaction potentials {{and the lack of}} relevant experimental access to the growth process are to blame for this failure. Here, we study the growth of fractal nanostructures in a two-dimensional (2 D) system, intercalated between mica and graphene. Based on our Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS) data we provide compelling evidence that these fractals are 2 D ice. They grow while they are in material contact with the atmosphere at 20 ^∘C and without significant thermal contact to the ambient. The growth is studied in-situ, in real time and space at the nanoscale. We find that the growing 2 D ice nanocrystals assume a fractal shape, which is conventionally attributed to Diffusion Limited Aggregation (DLA). However, DLA requires a low mass density mother phase, in contrast to the actual currently present high mass density mother phase. Latent heat effects and consequent transport of heat and molecules are found to be key ingredients for understanding the evolution of the snow (<b>ice)</b> <b>flakes.</b> We conclude that not the local availability of water molecules (DLA), but rather them having the locally required orientation is the key factor for incorporation into the 2 D ice nanocrystal. In combination with the transport of latent heat we attribute the evolution of fractal 2 D ice nanocrystals to local temperature dependent Rotation Limited Aggregation (RLA). The ice growth occurs under extreme supersaturation, i. e. the conditions closely resemble the natural ones for the growth of complex 2 D snow (<b>ice)</b> <b>flakes</b> and we consider our findings crucial for solving the 'perennial' snow (<b>ice)</b> <b>flake</b> enigma...|$|R

40|$|We {{present results}} from the {{coupling}} of FLake to the Met Office Unified Model (MetUM). The coupling and initialisation are first described, {{and the results of}} testing the coupled model in local and global model configurations are presented. These show that FLake has a small statistical impact on screen temperature, but has the potential to modify the weather in the vicinity of areas of significant inland water. Examination of <b>FLake</b> lake <b>ice</b> has revealed that the behaviour of lakes in the coupled model is unrealistic in some areas of significant sub-grid orography. Tests of various modifications to ameliorate this behaviour are presented. The results indicate which of the possible model changes best improve the annual cycle of lake <b>ice.</b> As <b>FLake</b> has been developed and tuned entirely outside the Unified Model system, these results can be interpreted as a useful objective measure of the performance of the Unified Model in terms of its near-surface characteristics...|$|R

50|$|An {{effective}} method {{of preserving the}} freshness of fish is to chill with ice by distributing ice uniformly around the fish.

Ice is produced in various shapes; crushed <b>ice</b> and <b>ice</b> <b>flakes,</b> plates, tubes and blocks are commonly used to cool fish.
