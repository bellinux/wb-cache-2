5|$|The {{first stage}} {{involves}} 12 clubs {{in a series}} of two-legged <b>knockout</b> ties. The six survivors join 26 clubs in the second stage, in which they are divided into eight groups of four. The teams in each group play in a double round-robin format, with each team playing home and away games against every other team in their group. The top two teams from each group are then drawn into the <b>knockout</b> stage, which consists of two-legged <b>knockout</b> ties. From that point, the competition proceeds with two-legged <b>knockout</b> ties to quarterfinals, semifinals, and the finals. Between 1960 and 1987 the previous winners did not enter the competition until the semifinal stage, making it much easier to retain the cup.|$|E

The winner of each quarter-final goes on to the semi-finals, and the respective winners proceed to the final. Losers of the semi-finals contest for third place, called the 'Bronze Final'. If a match in the <b>knockout</b> stages ends in a draw, the winner is determined through extra time. If that fails, the match goes into sudden death and the next team to score any points is the winner. As a last resort, a kicking competition is used.|$|E

Either boxer will lose if they cannot stand up before the count of ten after being knocked down (resulting in a <b>knockout</b> or KO) or if they are knocked down three times in the match (resulting in a technical <b>knockout</b> or TKO).
