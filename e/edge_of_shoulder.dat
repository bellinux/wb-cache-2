5000|$|In some {{countries}} major roads have [...] "tone bands" [...] impressed or {{cut into the}} <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> the legal roadway, so that drowsing drivers are awakened by a loud hum as they release the steering and drift off the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the road. Tone bands are {{also referred to as}} [...] "rumble strips", owing to the sound they create. An alternative method is the use of [...] "Raised Rib" [...] markings, which consists of a continuous line marking with ribs across the line at regular intervals. They were first specially authorised for use on motorways as an edge line marking to separate the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the hard <b>shoulder</b> from the main carriageway.

40|$|The use of {{computers}} {{has been associated with}} incidences of musculoskeletal discomforts among frequent users. The objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of musculoskeletal upper body discomforts among frequent computer users and to determine the associated risk factors. Data was collected by administering a modified Nordic questionnaire to 108 respondents of professional work groups from selected workplaces in Kenya. Personal characteristics, job and workstation factors were tested to predict the occurrence <b>of</b> neck, <b>shoulder,</b> upper back, hands/wrists and elbow discomforts. Binary logistic regression was used to identify the associations between risk factors and outcome variables. Prevalence rates of the discomforts were: neck (55. 6 %), shoulder (49. 5 %), upper back (45. 8 %), hands/wrists (27. 1 %) and elbows (16. 8 %). Neck discomfort (35. 0 %) and shoulder discomfort (38. 8 %) were most prevalent among the administration group, whereas wrists/hands discomfort (33. 3 %) and upper back discomfort (31. 95) were prevalent among bankers. The study revealed significant associations between the upper body musculoskeletal discomforts and some of the potential risk factors.

5000|$|The thin, semitranslucent shell has an elongate-conic shape. Its length {{measures}} 3 mm. The whorls of the protoconch are obliquely {{immersed in}} the first of the succeeding turns, above which only the tilted <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the last volution projects, which is marked by three strongly elevated spiral threads. The six whorls of the protoconch are well-rounded, moderately contracted at the sutures, and strongly slopingly shouldered. They are marked by weak rounded axial ribs which are best developed near the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shoulder.</b> <b>Of</b> these ribs about 24 are indicated on the. first turn, 18 upon the second to fourth, and 20 upon the penultimate turn. In addition to the axial sculpture the whorls are marked between the sutures by a number of spiral keels of diverse strength, of which 4 occur upon the first and second, 5 upon the third, 6 upon the fourth and the penultimate whorl. Of these spiral ridges the second one below the summit is the strongest and marks the angle <b>of</b> the <b>shoulder.</b> The junction <b>of</b> the ribs and cords form feeble nodules best shown at the shoulder. The sutures are strongly constricted. The periphery of the body whorl is marked by a low cord. The base of the shell is well rounded. It is marked by four low, broad cords and seven exceedingly fine incised lines, the latter about the umbilical area. The narrow, strongly incised grooves which separate the cords are crossed by numerous fine axial threads, which give them a pitted appearance. The aperture is oval, and slightly effuse anteriorly.

5000|$|Horshamosaurus seems, {{at roughly}} five metres length, {{to have been}} about 30% longer than the type species of Polacanthus, Polacanthus foxii and differs from it in {{numerous}} characters of the vertebrae and dermal armour. Apart from the greater length, in 1996 several traits were established, distinguishing Horshamosaurus from Polacanthus. The centrum facets of the back and tail vertebrae have a round instead of a heart-shaped profile. The transverse processes of the vertebrae each have two ridges at their undersides delimiting a depression and gradually merging with the vertebral body. The transverse processes of the front tail vertebrae have a distinctive top ridge, running from the front to the rear, merging with the neural arch {{at the base of}} the process, while sloping downwards at its inner side. The [...] "pseudoacromion" [...] is located close to the front <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>shoulder</b> blade. The rear ribs are large and tall instead of rather slender. The shinbone is relatively longer. The osteoderm spikes on the back have a circular base of which the front underside is excavated but the rear underside solid, instead of an oval base with a uniformly concave underside. One of the osteoderms seems to have been part of the back armour and is large and flat with a concave underside; plates of such a type have not been discovered with Polacanthus foxii.|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a computational tool for auto-segmenting {{the distribution of}} brain infusions observed by magnetic resonance imaging. Clinical usage of direct infusion is increasing as physicians recognize the need to attain high drug concentrations in the target structure with minimal off-target exposure. By co-infusing a Gadolinium-based contrast agent and visualizing the distribution using real-time using magnetic resonance imaging, physicians can make informed decisions about when to stop or adjust the infusion. However, manual segmentation of the images is tedious and affected by subjective preferences for window levels, image interpolation and personal biases about where to delineate the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the sloped <b>shoulder</b> <b>of</b> the infusion. This study {{presents a}} computational technique that uses a Gaussian Mixture Model to efficiently classify pixels as belonging to either the high-intensity infusate or low-intensity background. The algorithm was implemented as a distributable plug-in for the widely used imaging platform OsiriX®. Four independent operators segmented fourteen anonymized datasets to validate the tool's performance. The datasets were intra-operative magnetic resonance images of infusions into the thalamus or putamen of non-human primates. The tool effectively reproduced the manual segmentation volumes, while significantly reducing intra-operator variability by 67 ± 18 %.
