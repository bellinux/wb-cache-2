5|$|In February 2002, Curtis {{introduced}} TotalFark as {{a subscription}} service, charging $5 per month. By May 2007 {{there were an}} estimated 2,000 subscribers, generating $120,000 per year. Subscribers, known collectively as TotalFarkers or TFers, at one time <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> of seeing and commenting on all links submitted to the site, as opposed to only those approved for inclusion on the main page. However, as of 2010 an estimated 40% of links submitted to TotalFark are deleted within one minute of being submitted. In a typical 24-hour period, TotalFark's main page includes 1,200 to 1,800 links with associated comment threads, whereas Fark's main page includes only 60 to 80 links from that total.|$|E
5|$|The burgesses, who {{had little}} {{independence}} under the abbey, tried to obtain self-government after {{the dissolution of}} the monasteries. The king ordered Letters Patent to be drawn up granting their requests, but it was not implemented. In 1550 the Liberty of Whitby Strand, except for Hackness, was granted to the Earl of Warwick who in 1551 conveyed it to Sir John York and his wife Anne who sold the lease to the Cholmleys. In the reign of Elizabeth I, Whitby was a small fishing port. In 1635 the owners of the liberty governed the port and town where 24 burgesses <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> of buying and selling goods brought in by sea. Burgage tenure continued until 1837, when by an Act of Parliament, government of the town was entrusted to a board of Improvement Commissioners, elected by the ratepayers.|$|E
5|$|For {{almost all}} of their history, Serjeants at Law and King's Serjeants were the only advocates given rights of {{audience}} in the Court of Common Pleas. Until the 17th century they were also first {{in the order of}} precedence in the Court of King's Bench and Court of Chancery, which gave them priority in motions before the court. Serjeants also <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> of being immune from most normal forms of lawsuit – they could only be sued by a writ from the Court of Chancery. It was held as an extension of this that servants of Serjeants could only be sued in the Common Pleas. As part of the Court of Common Pleas the Serjeants also performed some judicial duties, such as levying fines. In exchange for these privileges, Serjeants were expected to fulfil certain duties; firstly, that they represent anybody who asked regardless of their ability to pay, and secondly that, due to the small number of judges, they serve as deputy judges to hear cases when there was no judge available.|$|E

5|$|The town of Chiprovtsi {{and several}} of the {{surrounding}} villages were administratively organized as a has, or a private possession of the sultan's royal family and later of the sultan's mother. The special status of the area meant that the local Christians would not be subject to the usual discriminatory laws, but would have to pay an annual tribute of silver to the sultan. Later on, the estate was organized as a waqf, a land devoted for Muslim religious or charitable purposes. Chiprovtsi and the region were inhabited exclusively by Christians and they <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> to perform their rituals in public without discrimination. The only Turkish person in the town was the sultan's representative and no Turks were allowed to settle there, as the local Bulgarians enjoyed self-government to a certain degree and were administered by an elected council of eminent Bulgarian residents (knezove). A fragment of the area's pre-Ottoman Bulgarian administrative division may have also been preserved, as it is referred to under the Slavic name voivodeship in some documents.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately for James, {{negotiation}} with Spain proved generally unpopular, {{both with the}} public and with James's court. The English Parliament was actively hostile towards Spain and Catholicism, and thus, when called by James in 1621, the members hoped for an enforcement of recusancy laws, a naval campaign against Spain, and a Protestant marriage for the Prince of Wales. James's Lord Chancellor, Francis Bacon, was impeached before the House of Lords for corruption. The impeachment was the first since 1459 without the king's official sanction {{in the form of}} a bill of attainder. The incident set an important precedent as the process of impeachment would later be used against Charles and his supporters: the Duke of Buckingham, Archbishop Laud, and the Earl of Strafford. James insisted that the House of Commons be concerned exclusively with domestic affairs, while the members protested that they <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> of free speech within the Commons' walls, demanding war with Spain and a Protestant Princess of Wales. Charles, like his father, considered the discussion of his marriage in the Commons impertinent and an infringement of his father's royal prerogative. In January 1622, James dissolved Parliament, angry at what he perceived as the members' impudence and intransigence.|$|E

However, Sim Euigyeom, the brother of Queen Insun, opposed Kim's promotion {{on the grounds that}} Kim had often given bribes to the corrupt official Yun Wonhyeong. However, Kim was promoted.|$|E

25|$|The {{conflation}} {{was decided}} by imperial decree in the Song dynasty, when {{under the influence}} of the Taoist religion the emperors determined that the Jade King was the same supreme God as Tian and Shangdi. From that moment, the Jade Deity rose to prominence in Taoist and folk religious temples as the equivalent of the God to whom the emperors <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> to worship at the Temple of Heaven.|$|E
25|$|The {{kingdom of}} Arioald (626-636), which brought the capital back to Pavia, {{was troubled by}} these conflicts, {{as well as from}} {{external}} threats; the King was able to withstand an attack of the Avars in Friuli, but not to limit the growing influence of the Franks in the kingdom. At his death, the legend says that, with identical procedure to that followed with his mother Teodolinda, Queen Gundeperga <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> to choose her new husband and king. The choice fell on Rothari, also duke of Brescia and Arian.|$|E

The Young Poland movement witnessed {{the birth of}} modern Polish art, and engaged in {{a great deal of}} formal experimentation led by Jacek Malczewski, Stanisław Wyspiański, Józef Mehoffer, and a group of Polish Impressionists. Stanisław Witkiewicz was an ardent supporter of Realism, its main representative being Józef Chełmoński, while Artur Grottger specialized in Romanticism. Within historically-orientated circles, Henryk Siemiradzki dominated with his monumental Academic Art and ancient Roman theme.|$|E
25|$|On {{the west}} bank of the River Corrib as it enters the sea is the ancient {{neighbourhood}} of The Claddagh. For centuries it was an Irish-speaking enclave outside the city walls. Claddagh residents were mainly fisher folk and were governed by an elected 'King'. The King of the Claddagh settled or arbitrated disputes among the locals and <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> of a white sail on his fishing boat. The last true king, Martin Oliver, died in 1972. The title is still used but in a purely honorary and ceremonial context. The current King is Michael Lynskey. The area is also famous for its association with the Claddagh Ring.|$|E
25|$|One {{explanation}} for the alleged size of these colossal ships was that the largest 44 Zhang treasure ships were merely for a display of imperial power by the Emperor and imperial bureaucrats on the Yangtze River when on court business, including when reviewing Zheng He's actual expedition fleet. The Yangtze River, with its calmer waters, may have been navigable for such large but unseaworthy ships. Zheng He would not have <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> in rank to command the largest of these ships. The largest ships of Zheng He's fleet were the 6 masted 2000-liao ships. This would give burthen of 500 tons and a displacement tonnage of about 800 tons.|$|E

25|$|In {{all these}} cases, the father might dower her. If he did not, on his death the {{brothers}} were obligated to do so, {{giving her a}} full child's share if a wife, a concubine or a vestal, but one-third of a child's share {{if she were a}} hierodule or a Marduk priestess. The latter <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> of exemption from state dues and absolute disposal of her property. All other daughters had only a life interest in their dowry, which reverted to their family if childless or went to their children if they had any. A father might, however, execute a deed granting a daughter power to leave her property to a favorite brother or sister.|$|E

He also accumulated an extensive library, both in his St Petersburg palace and in his rural estate, Borjomi, where he liked to work undisturbed. His great wealth enabled him to have a number of research assistants, a luxury seldom available to most historians. His most valuable helper with his historical work was Constantine Brummer, his aide-de-camp since the earliest years of his military career who was his loyal friend until the end.|$|E
25|$|By 1910, {{the pattern}} of British rule in the Malay lands was established. The Straits Settlements were a Crown colony, ruled by a {{governor}} {{under the supervision of}} the Colonial Office in London. Their population was about half Chinese, but all residents, regardless of race, were British subjects. The first four states to accept British residents, Perak, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, and Pahang, were termed the Federated Malay States: while technically independent, they were placed under a Resident-General in 1895, making them British colonies in all but name. The Unfederated Malay States (Johore, Kedah, Kelantan, Perlis, and Terengganu) had a slightly larger degree of independence, although they were unable to resist the wishes of their British residents for long. Johor, as Britain's closest ally in Malay affairs, <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> of a written constitution, which gave the Sultan the right to appoint his own Cabinet, but he was generally careful to consult the British first.|$|E

25|$|Because her father, Robert Sidney, was {{governor}} of Flushing, Wroth {{spent much of her}} childhood at the home of Mary Sidney, and Penshurst Place, Baynard’s Castle in London. Penshurst Place {{was one of the great}} country houses in the Elizabethan and Jacobean period. It was a center of literary and cultural activity and its gracious hospitality is praised in Ben Jonson's famous poem To Penshurst. During a time when most women were illiterate, Wroth <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> of a formal education, which was obtained from household tutors under the guidance of her mother. With her family connections, a career at court was all but inevitable. Wroth danced before Queen Elizabeth on a visit to Penshurst and again in court in 1602. At this time a likeness of her as a girl in a group portrait of Lady Sidney and her children was painted by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger in 1596, and is now on display at Penshurst. As a young woman, Lady Mary belonged to Queen Anne’s intimate circle of friends and actively participated in masques and entertainments.|$|E

500|$|On April 30, von Horn {{was sent}} to {{discover}} what kind of force was required. A few days later, he met with Amer in Cairo {{and found out that}} Egypt had no intention of drawing all its troops from Yemen. After a few more days, he was told by the Saudi deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Omar Saqqaff, that the Saudis would not accept any attempt by Egypt to leave security forces after their withdrawal. Saudi Arabia had already been cutting back on its support to the royalists, in part because Egypt's projected plan for unity with Syria and Iraq made Nasser seem too dangerous. By that time, the war cost Egypt $1,000,000 a day and nearly 5,000 casualties. Though promising to remove her troops, Egypt <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>privilege</b> of leaving an unspecified number for the [...] "training" [...] of Yemen's republican army.|$|E
