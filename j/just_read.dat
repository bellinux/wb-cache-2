25|$|In the 1930s, {{the first}} {{academic}} English translations, by Alexander Dru, David F. Swenson, Douglas V. Steere, and Walter Lowrie appeared, under the editorial efforts of Oxford University Press editor Charles Williams, {{one of the}} members of the Inklings. Thomas Henry Croxall, another early translator, Lowrie, and Dru all hoped that people would not <b>just</b> <b>read</b> about Kierkegaard but would actually read his works. Dru published an English translation of Kierkegaard's Journals in 1958; Alastair Hannay translated some of Kierkegaard's works. From the 1960s to the 1990s, Howard V. Hong and Edna H. Hong translated his works more than once. The first volume of their first version of the Journals and Papers (Indiana, 1967–1978) won the 1968 U.S. National Book Award in category Translation. They both dedicated their lives to the study of Søren Kierkegaard and his works, which are maintained at the Howard V. and Edna H. Hong Kierkegaard Library. Jon Stewart from the University of Copenhagen has written extensively about Søren Kierkegaard.|$|E
25|$|According to Gee, {{there are}} at least two reasons why we should {{consider}} literacy in broader terms than the traditional conception of literacy as the ability to read and write. First, in our world today, language is by no means the only communication system available. Many types of visual images and symbols have specific significances, and so “visual literacies” and literacies of other modes, or the concept of multimodal literacy, are also included in Gee’s conception of new literacies. Second, Gee proposes that reading and writing (the ‘meat’ of literacy according to the traditional notion of the term) are not such obvious ideas as they first appear. “After all,” he states, “we never <b>just</b> <b>read</b> or write; rather, we always read or write something in some way”. In other words, according to which type of text we read there are different ways in which we read depending on the “rules” of how to read such a text. Literacy to Gee, even if it is the traditional print-based literacy, should be conceived as being multiple, or comprising different literacies, since we need different types of literacies to read different kinds of texts in ways that meet our particular purposes in reading them.|$|E

Michael Berry said in the San Francisco Chronicle that this [...] "hopscotching strategy allows for multiple layers of suspense and irony". Rodriguez said these [...] "sudden shifts in points of view that give new meaning to the passage you have <b>just</b> <b>read</b> and leaps in chronology that keep crucial incidents offstage" [...] makes it an [...] "agile, sometimes tricky novel", and the closest Irving has come to writing metafiction.|$|E

Lee was tasked with writing a novella on which a script could be based, submitting {{it at the end}} of 1983. Henson approached Terry Jones to write the film's script as [...] "his daughter Lisa had <b>just</b> <b>read</b> Erik the Viking and suggested that he try me as screen-writer." [...] Jones was given Dennis Lee's novella to use as a basis for his script, but later told Empire that Lee had produced an unfinished [...] "poetic novella" [...] that he [...] "didn't really get on with." [...] In light of this, Jones [...] "discarded it and sat down with Brian 's drawings and sifted through them and found the ones that I really liked, and started creating the story from them." ...|$|E
500|$|Though Mya's {{character}} was {{generally regarded as}} impressive, the underlying technology was described by Peggy Albright in Wireless Week as not surprising; Albright said Motorola was [...] "latest company in recent weeks to introduce a voice-activated virtual assistant", as Mya was announced shortly after Microsoft had announced their MiPad, and Lucent had launched their Mobile Voice Activated Dialing software. However, Tobey Grummet spoke highly {{of the program in}} anticipation of its release, and Mya was described by Elliot Drucker of Wireless Week as a solution to the limitations of accessing the Internet on a mobile phone, without a keyboard or large colour display. While regarding the program with interest, John Sullivan doubted that Mya would persuade people who were not already on the Internet to start using it, and stated that if Mya could only read emails and not actually converse with him, he would rather <b>just</b> <b>read</b> his emails himself. Dawn Chmielewski from the Orange County Register called Mya a [...] "crude interpretation of things to come", noting that speech technology at the time was not without its limitations.|$|E

500|$|In December 2001, Moore further {{explained}} his opposition, citing how a reader {{can take the}} time to absorb the character backgrounds, by having the option of turning back the pages so that they can connect elements they had <b>just</b> <b>read</b> to past elements, but that film forces you to watch the story at 24 frames per second. Moore's opposition to the film adaptation crystallized after the 2003 film version of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was released, and he intends to give any resulting royalties from Watchmen to the comic's artist, Dave Gibbons. In Moore’s opinion, Hayter’s script was the closest anyone could get to the original comic, but added {{that he would not be}} going to see the film when completed. Moore said, [...] "My book is a comic book. Not a movie, not a novel. A comic book. It's been made in a certain way, and designed to be read a certain way: in an armchair, nice and cozy next to a fire, with a steaming cup of coffee." ...|$|E

Arulpragasam has had a difficult relationship with her father, due to his political activities in the 1980s and complete absence during much of her life.

500|$|Although Barton speaks {{frequently}} {{about his}} desire to help create [...] "a new, living theater, of and about and for the common man", he does not recognize that such a theater has already been created: the movies. In fact, he disdains this authentically popular form. On the other hand, the world of Broadway theatre in Barton Fink {{is a place of}} high culture, where the creator believes most fully that his work embodies his own values. Although he pretends to disdain his own success, Barton believes he has achieved a great victory with Bare Ruined Choirs. He seeks praise; when his agent Garland asks if he's seen the glowing review in the Herald, Barton says [...] "No", even though his producer had <b>just</b> <b>read</b> it to him. Barton feels close to the theatre, confident that it can help him create work that honors [...] "the common man". The men and women who funded the production– [...] "those people", as Barton calls them– [...] demonstrate that Broadway is just as concerned with profit as Hollywood; but its intimacy and smaller scale allow the author to feel that his work has real value.|$|E

500|$|Celia Larkin, {{writing on}} 12 February 2012 in the Irish Sunday Independent, said [...] "There was {{something}} very satisfying about Heather Mills finally having her voice heard above {{the roar of the}} Red Tops. If you actually take the time to listen to Mills, I mean listen, not <b>just</b> <b>read</b> what's written about her, you'll see she is a strong, sincere, independent woman. She didn't lie down under the weight of McCartney's fame and wealth, she continued to plough her own furrow, campaigning for her charities, maintaining a strong individuality. And that, it seems, is the greatest sin of all. Is it any wonder she was reduced to tears in the October 2007 GMTV interview? Did we feel sympathy for her then? No. 'Heather Mills has Melt Down' screamed the headlines, so now she had lost her marbles to boot. And if that wasn't enough, Carole Malone of the Sunday Mirror, one of the papers that was relentless in its attacks on Mills, accused her of staging an act on live TV in order to further her cause in the upcoming divorce hearing. How cruel can you get?" ...|$|E
500|$|Tanner {{was born}} on August 8, 1904 in Nashville, Tennessee, the son of Felix Elmo Tanner and Willie Mae (nee) Moore. He grew up in Detroit, and moved to Memphis with his family by 1926. [...] As a young boy, Tanner studied the violin and was {{successful}} with it until eye trouble {{made it difficult for}} him to read notes. [...] His musical training helped Tanner to develop the ability to scan music or lyrics quickly and then either sing or whistle what he had <b>just</b> <b>read.</b> On his walk home from work, Tanner passed a cemetery each night and started whistling as he passed by. Not everyone appreciated Tanner's whistling in the evening; he was once jailed in Albuquerque, New Mexico for whistling after 10pm. A graduate of the University of Tennessee, Tanner raced automobiles and worked as a mechanic in Memphis. While performing the duties of his employment he liked to whistle and sing. [...] One day in 1928, he had a repair job for a customer who happened to work at WMC radio. After hearing Tanner singing while working on his car, the announcer suggested Tanner audition for the radio station. His consequent on-air appearance brought a call from Paramount Records, which had offices in Chicago.|$|E

500|$|The Gunnerkrigg Court webcomic is told in {{a series}} of episodic {{chapters}} such that each, while forming part of the overall storyline, also functions individually as a stand-alone story arc."Each of the chapters individually is sort of a self-contained thing, so if you were to <b>just</b> <b>read</b> one of them it wouldn't be like you {{had no idea what was}} going on." [...] The themes and topics of the chapters vary widely: as one reviewer describes, [...] "You are also not subjected to 400-plus pages of intricate plot movement. While there is an overall story arc, there are also lighter chapters that focus on unusual classes ... or small moments that build the main characters." [...] Each chapter begins with a title page and ends with one or more [...] "bonus pages," [...] which are not integral to the main storyline but often offer ancillary details about the world of Gunnerkrigg Court or about minor characters. [...] The chapters have varied in length from four pages to more than eighty. [...] Each page is drawn in traditional (A4; 210 × 297mm) page format and divided arbitrarily into frames. At the bottom of the most recent page is a link to a comments thread for that page, in which readers may comment on and discuss that day's comic.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of Otello Verdi commented, [...] "After having relentlessly massacred so many heroes and heroines, I have at last the right to laugh a little." [...] He had {{considered}} a variety of comic subjects but had found none of them wholly suitable and confided his ambition to Boito. The librettist said nothing at the time but secretly began work on a libretto based on The Merry Wives of Windsor with additional material taken from Henry IV, Part 1 and Part 2. Verdi received the draft libretto probably in early July 1889 after he had <b>just</b> <b>read</b> Shakespeare's play: [...] "Benissimo! Benissimo!... No one could have done better than you", he wrote back to Boito. But he still had doubts: his age, his health (which he admits to being good) {{and his ability to}} complete the project: [...] "If I were not to finish the music?". If the project failed, {{it would have been a}} waste of Boito's time, and have distracted him from completing his own new opera. Finally on 10 July 1889 he wrote again: [...] "So be it! So let's do Falstaff! For now, let's not think of obstacles, of age, of illnesses!" [...] Verdi emphasised the need for secrecy, but continued [...] "If you are in the mood, then start to write." [...] Later he wrote to Boito (capitals and exclamation marks are Verdi's own): [...] "What joy to be able to say to the public: HERE WE ARE AGAIN!!! COME AND SEE US!" ...|$|E
