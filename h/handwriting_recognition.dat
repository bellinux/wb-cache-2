25|$|Although {{thorough}} {{training and}} practice {{are required to}} use Cangjie, many Cantonese speakers have taken Cangjie input courses because of the fast typing speed availed by the input method. This method is the fastest because it has the capability to fetch the exact, unambiguous Chinese character which the user has in mind to input, pinpointing to only one character in most cases. This is also the reason why no provision for an input of phonetic accent is needed to complement this Input Method. The Cangjie character feature is available on both Mac OS X and Windows.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Handwriting</b> {{character}} <b>recognition</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} common research topics. Many approaches have applied to English characters and achieve high accuracy. However, the complexities in the language of each country are not same. Vietnamese <b>handwriting</b> character <b>recognition</b> is facing many problems, most of them come from the accent. This paper focuses on accent recognition, especially when there is a connection between two accents- a common problem which affects the identification result. Our approach starts with separating accent from character using the connected-component labeling method. The obtained accent then is checked if it is single or multiple (the combination of many accents). The recognition is performed using support vector machines with the single accent, or hidden Markov model if the accent is multiple. Proposed solution has been tested and obtained high accuracy.

40|$|Farsi <b>Handwriting</b> Word <b>Recognition</b> (FHWR), {{especially}} those with different orientation and scale changes as well as different handwriting style, is a challenging and important problem in document image analysis. This paper proposes a holistic FHWR scheme using local features of M-Band packet wavelet. The rotation and scale invariant local feature extraction for a given word image involves applying a polar transform to eliminate the rotation and scale effects, but at same time produce a row shifted polar image, which is then passed to an M-Band wavelet transform with row shift invariant to eliminate the row shift effects. So, the output M-Band wavelet coefficients are rotation and scale invariant. A local feature vector extracted from each subband of M-Band wavelet coefficients is constructed for rotation and scale invariant FHWR. In the experiments, we employed a Mahalanobis classifier to recognition a set of 224 distinct Farsi words selected from different persons with different style of writing. The experimental results, based on different handwriting style testing data sets for images with different orientations and scales, show that the proposed classification scheme using M-Band wavelet signatures outperforms other holistic <b>handwriting</b> word <b>recognition</b> methods, its overall accuracy rate for joint rotation and scale invariance being 95. 8 percent, demonstrating that the extracted local energy features are effective rotation and scale invariant features...|$|R
30|$|This work aims at {{exploring}} handwriting characteristics and discovering differences between texting and handwriting {{in order to}} design a handwriting-based instant messaging system. In order {{to better understand the}} progress of different input methods, this article first reviews directly related works including the personality connection with <b>handwriting,</b> stroke <b>recognition,</b> <b>handwriting</b> delivery, speech <b>recognition,</b> and stroke vectorization. In order to achieve this goal, we take the following steps: First, we conduct a pilot study to understand the effectiveness in emotional delivery with handwriting and discover texting issues in commonly used Chinese input methods for mobile devices. Second, according to the criteria concluded in the pilot study, we design and implement emotion-embedded handwriting messaging by recording writing strokes on the entire touch screen, vectorizing them as Bézier curves, and sending them as instant messages. Third, we verify our designed system by conducting user studies to show that users prefer our handwriting messaging system while they intend to deliver information with sincerity and emotion. All participants of both initial pilot studies and final user studies are selected randomly in front of Gongguan Station of Metro Transport in Taipei. They have varied sexes, ages, and experience in mobile and computer usage, but all participants have experience in using instant messaging on mobile devices and computers. We interview the participants and ask them to answer our designed questionnaires. All questions are in 5 -point Likert scales where 1 to 5 ranks the degree of satisfaction and agreement to the criteria as very disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, and very agree. After collecting all valid questionnaires, we use the mean score to indicate the degree of satisfaction and agreement of all questionnaires.|$|R
