50|$|If {{there is}} enough {{available}} oxygen, leucomethylene blue is then re-oxidized to methylene blue and the blue color of the solution is restored. The availability of oxygen is increased by shaking the solution. When the solution comes to rest, glucose reduction of the redox dye again takes the upper hand {{and the color of}} the solution disappears. The reaction is first order in glucose, methylene blue and hydroxide ion and zero-order in oxygen. Other glucose oxidation products besides sodium gluconate that are reported are D-arabino-hexos-2-ulose (<b>glucosone),</b> the anion of D-arabinonate after splitting of a formate anion and finally arabinonic acid.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: α-Dicarbonyl {{compounds}} (α-DCs) such as 3 -deoxyglucosone (3 -DG) and <b>glucosone</b> are {{markers of}} both Maillard and degradation reactions of sugars {{and also of}} certain enzymatic processes. However, quantitation of these compounds is not straightforward when more abundant carbohydrates are present in real samples. Therefore in this work a GC/MS method was developed to separate monosaccharides, 3 -DG and <b>glucosone</b> and applied to analyze them in carbohydrate-rich food products. Difructose anhydrides (DFAs), known markers of sugar degradation, were also determined. The effect of time and temperature in the production and storage of these compounds was also evaluated. RESULTS: Under optimized conditions, good separation between monosaccharides and α-DCs was achieved. Must syrups showed the highest concentrations of 3 -DG and <b>glucosone</b> (average values 9. 2 and 5. 8 mg g - 1 respectively). Coffee substitutes based on carob, chicory and blends showed the highest content of DFAs. Heating and storage assays proved that production of 3 -DG was influenced by temperature, while <b>glucosone</b> was more affected by storage time. CONCLUSION: The proposed method allows the rapid quantitation of 3 -DG and <b>glucosone</b> along with carbohydrates and DFAs in different food products, which is essential to determine their degradation level. Moreover, the α-DC content in several foods is reported for the first time.

40|$|<b>Glucosone</b> {{has been}} {{identified}} as the main intermediate sugar moiety product of the copper(II) -catalysed autoxidation of the Amadori compound [Kawakishi, Tsunehiro & Uchida (1991) Carbohydr. Res. 211, 167 - 171]. Oxidative fragmentation of the model protein, especially selective degradation of the histidine residue in protein or peptides mediated by the copper(II) -catalysed autoxidation of <b>glucosone,</b> is discussed in this paper. The oxidative damage to protein could be retarded by catalase (EC 1. 11. 1. 16) and EDTA, while superoxide dismutase (EC 1. 15. 1. 1) and hydroxyradical scavengers showed little effect. Through the process of the oxidative degradation of N-benzoylhistidine and other histidine-containing peptides, the oxidation of the imidazole ring in histidine caused by the glucosone-copper(II) system was the same as that by the ascorbate-copper(II) system. These facts suggest that the copper-catalysed autoxidation of <b>glucosone</b> could generate some active-oxygen species causing oxidative damage to protein similar to that caused by the ascorbate-copper(II) system...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemistry}} of the fructosamine assay was studied {{by using the}} Amadori compound, N”-formyl-N 8 -fructose-lysine (fFL), an analog of glycated lysine residues in pro-tein. Previously (Clin Chem 1993; 39 : 2460 - 5), we re-ported that free lysine was formed from fFL at 70 % yield during incubationwith alkaline nitrobluetetrazolium (NBT) under the conditions routinely used for the fructosamine assay (sodium carbonate buffer, pH 10. 35 at 37 #{ 176 }C). Here, we show that o-glucosone is the primary carbohydrate oxidation product formed from Amadori compounds in the fructosamine assay. <b>Glucosone,</b> which decomposes un-der alkaline assay conditionswith a half-life of < 30 mm, reaches a maximum concentration of- 50 % of the initial fFL concentration after 10 mm of incubation. Like fFL, <b>glucosone</b> reduces NBT to the purple monoformazan dye...|$|E
40|$|Pyranose 2 -oxidase (POX) was {{recovered}} from Phanerochaete chrysosporium BKM-F- 1767 solid substrate culture using mild extraction conditions and was purified. 13 C-nuclear magnetic resonance confirmed production of d-arabino-hexos- 2 -ulose (<b>glucosone)</b> from d-glucose with the oxidase. Peptide fingerprints generated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry of tryptic digests {{and analysis of}} the corresponding cDNA revealed a structurally unusual sequence for the P. chrysosporium POX. Relatively high levels of pox transcript were detected under carbon-starved culture conditions but not under nutrient sufficiency. This regulation pattern is similar to that observed for lignin peroxidases, manganese peroxidases, and glyoxal oxidase of P. chrysosporium, supporting evidence that POX has a role in lignocellulose degradation...|$|E
40|$|The {{extent of}} glycation and {{conformational}} changes of horse myoglobin (Mb) upon glycation with N-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc), glucose (Glc) and glucosamine (GlcN) were investigated. Among tested sugars, {{the rate of}} glycation with GlcN was the most rapid as shown by MALDI and ESI mass spectrometries. Protein oxidation, as evaluated {{by the amount of}} carbonyl groups present on Mb, was found to increase exponentially in Mb-Glc conjugates over time, whereas in Mb-GlcN mixtures the carbonyl groups decreased significantly after maximum at 3 days of the reaction. The reaction between GlcN and Mb resulted in a significantly higher amount of α-dicarbonyl compounds, mostly <b>glucosone</b> and 3 -deoxyglucosone, ranging from and 27 to 332 mg/L and from 14 to 304 mg/L, respectively. Already at 0. 5 days, tertiary structural changes of Mb-GlcN conjugate were observed by altered tryptophan fluorescence. A reduction of metmyoglobin to deoxy-and oxymyoglobin forms was observed {{on the first day of}} reaction, coinciding with the greatest amount of <b>glucosone</b> produced. In contrast to native α-helical myoglobin, 41 % of the glycated protein sequence was transformed into a β-sheet conformation, as determined by circular dichroism spectropolarimetry. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that Mb glycation with GlcN causes the formation of amorphous or fibrous aggregates, started already at 3 reaction days. These aggregates bind to an amyloid-specific dye thioflavin T. With the aid of α-dicarbonyl compounds and advanced products of reaction, this study suggests that the Mb glycation with GlcN induces the unfolding of an initially globular protein structure into amyloid fibrils comprised of a β-sheet structure...|$|E
40|$|Glyco-oxidation {{is linked}} to the {{pathophysiology}} of diabetes and diabetic complications. The process of glyco-oxidation generates reactive dicarbonyls, which form adducts on arginine residues in distributions throughout the proteome that are site-specific depending on the protein microenvironment. Dicarbonyl adducts are thus markers for glyco-oxidative stress. Various approaches using mass spectrometry permits the identification, localization, and quantification of these dicarbonyl adducts. Using MG as a model dicarbonyl, a shotgun proteomics approach identified the sites for modification of major plasma proteins. Thirty five sites on seven abundant plasma proteins were found, and investigation into the microenvironment surrounding the target arginine sites revealed a neighboring charged residue motif where adjacent residues were either negatively or positively charged. One of the sites identified was R 257 in HSA, which is located in the important drug binding site I. We validated drug site I as a target for MG modification by the adaptation of two assays to monitor the effect of MG modification. MG significantly decreases the rate of hydrolysis of PGE 2 in drug site I, and induces the displacement of prodan from drug site I. Molecular modeling of warfarin docking at drug site I with the MG-modified R 257 resulted in significantly decreased binding and change in binding orientation. The oxidation products of susceptible residues methionine, tryptophan, and cysteine were evaluated using MRM of oxidized HSA peptides. Oxidation of methionine gave the M+ 16 single oxidized product, and M 329 in HSA was the most responsive site. Oxidation of the sole W 214 tryptophan produced the W+ 32 double oxidation product, and oxidation of C 34 produced the C+ 48 triple oxidation product. MG, 3 DG, and <b>glucosone</b> were evaluated for propensity to modify 12 HSA sites based on MRM of dicarbonyl modified HSA. Dicarbonyl modification was independent of arginine solvent accessibility. In a clinical study using nephropathy as an endpoint, sites of oxidation and modification of HSA by MG, 3 DG, and <b>glucosone</b> were quantified by MRM. The most important variable among diabetic subjects was metformin use, and subjects taking metformin had significantly reduced markers for glyco-oxidation. These findings may be useful in the development of new diabetes therapies that aim to ameliorate glyco-oxidative stress...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{systematically}} {{evaluate the}} modification of lens proteins by aldose and dicarbonyl sugars during the glycation process, the sugar-dependent incorporation of Lys and Arg, SDS–PAGE profile, amino acid analysis, and fluorophore formation (excitation 370 nm/emission 440 nm) were determined. Reaction mixtures with glycolaldehyde, glyceraldehyde, threose and 3 -deoxythreosone showed the greatest extent of Lys crosslinking and fluorescence formation. An increase in fluorescence intensity, but {{a decrease in}} Lys and Arg crosslinking, was found with glyoxal, methylglyoxal, hydroxypyruvaldehyde and threosone. In addition glyoxal, methylglyoxal and hydroxypyruvaldehyde caused the specific loss of Arg residues in lens proteins. Reaction mixtures with xylose, xylosone, glucose, <b>glucosone</b> and 3 -deoxyglucosone exhibited the least protein modifications; however, incubation with 3 -deoxyxylosone resulted in extensive loss of Lys and Arg residues, a higher extent of Lys or Arg crosslinking and significant fluorophore formation. Each sugar exhibited unique characteristics in the modification of lens proteins by glycation. To validly compare the protein modifications occurring during glycation reactions, a systematic approach was employed to evaluate the potential role of aldose and dicarbonyl sugars in protein modification...|$|E
40|$|A water-methanol {{solution}} of glycine and scD-glucose was refluxed for seven hr. The solvent was evaporated under vacuum {{at room temperature}} and the residue was dialyzed against distilled water. After dialysis, the solvent was evaporated under vacuum at room temperature. The non-dialyzable fraction was further fractionated by gel filtration. The process yielded three polymeric materials (10, 000 $<$ M $<$ 20, 000) whose purity was verified by HPLC. The isolated polymers were further analyzed by UV-VIS and FTIR spectroscopy and by pyrolysis/GC/MS. Elemental analysis indicated that polymer A has the following empirical formula $ rm C sb 6 H sb{ 11 }N sb 1 O sb 4 $ and polymers B 1 and B 2 have the same empirical formula as glucose $ rm C sb 1 H sb 2 O sb 1. $ The origin of nitrogen containing polymer A was assigned to Amadori intermediate or to some of its derivatives and the origin of polymers B 1 and B 2 was assigned to <b>Glucosone</b> and to 3 - or 1 -deoxyglucosones; common non-nitrogen containing reactive intermediates during Maillard reaction. Plausible mechanisms were proposed {{for the formation of}} polymers...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe enzyme aldos- 2 -ulose dehydratase/isomerase (AUDH) {{participates in}} {{carbohydrate}} secondary metabolism, catalyzing {{the conversion of}} <b>glucosone</b> and 1, 5 -d-anhydrofructose to the secondary metabolites cortalcerone and microthecin, respectively. AUDH is a homo-dimeric enzyme with subunits of 900 amino acids. The subunit consists of a seven-bladed β-propeller domain, two cupin folds and a C-terminal lectin domain. AUDH contains a structural Zn 2 + and Mg 2 + located in loop regions and two zinc ions {{at the bottom of}} two putative active-site clefts in the propeller and the cupin domain, respectively. Catalysis is dependent on these two zinc ions, as their specific removal led to loss of enzymatic activity. The structure of the Zn 2 +-depleted enzyme is very similar to that of native AUDH, and structural changes upon metal removal as the cause for the catalytic deficiencies can be excluded. The complex with the reaction intermediate ascopyrone M shows binding of this compound at two different sites, with direct coordination to Zn 2 + in the propeller domain and as second sphere ligand of the metal ion in the cupin domain. These observations suggest that the two reactions of AUDH might be catalyzed in two different active sites, about 60  Å apart. The dehydration reaction most likely follows an elimination mechanism, where Zn 2 + acts as a Lewis acid polarizing the C 2 keto group of 1, 5 -d-anhydrofructose. Abstraction of the proton at the C 3 carbon atom and protonation of the leaving group, the C 4 hydroxyl moiety, could potentially be catalyzed by the side chain of the suitably positioned residue His 155...|$|E
40|$|The role of redox {{reactions}} {{in the formation}} of aroma volatiles, colour and other non-volatiles in the Maillard Reaction was investigated. The electrochemical properties of individual reactants and Maillard model mixtures were monitored via ORP (oxidation-reduction potential) and oxygen electrodes. All models exhibited unique electrochemical activities represented by their corresponding ORP profiles. Investigation into the redox potentials of several model systems demonstrated that the increased negative value of a redox potential is not necessarily correlated with its browning potential. An optimal redox potential range, where browning is favoured, was found to represent a balance between carbonyl and hydroxyl moieties in the structure. Adjustment of this redox potential by introducing reducing or oxidizing species can shift this balance resulting in modifications in browning capacities. However, it was concluded that there is a clear relationship between browning ability and reducing capacity of the model systems. Furthermore, a novel oxidative pyrolysis technique was developed to study the role of oxidative environment on the product distribution during pyrolysis and to investigate the mechanism of formation of non-volatiles through 13 C and 15 N-label incorporation. Application of this technique to glucoselglycine model system have indicated that most non-volatile Maillard reaction products can arise from glucose oxidation intermediates such as <b>glucosone,</b> gluconic acid and deoxyglucosones. To study the specific role of redox {{reactions in}} the formation of non-volatiles, a post-pyrolytic derivatization technique was developed and optimized. Several non-volatile end products were identified and mechanistically confirmed to involve oxidation and reduction reactions for their formation, such as lactones, hydroxylated benzenes and hydroxylated pyrazine. The latter was identified and confirmed to be generated via the dimerization of glycine and subsequent oxidation. In addition, the formation of different volatiles such as pyrazole, imidazole and oxazole was mechanistically confirmed to depend on redox reactions...|$|E
40|$|Certain organisms, can {{during periods}} of limited resources, adapt their {{metabolism}} to enable biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, compounds that increase competitiveness and chances of survival. The subjects of this thesis are enzymes acting on carbohydrate substrates during secondary metabolism. The enzymatic attachment of carbohydrate moieties onto precursors of polyketide antibiotics such as anthracyclines, required for their biological activity, is performed by glycosyltransferases (GT). The anthracycline nogalamycin contains two carbohydrates: a nogalose moiety attached via an O-glycosidic bond to C 7, and a nogalamine attached via an O-glycosidic bond to C 1 and an unusual carbon-carbon bond between C 2 and C 5 ´´ of the sugar. Genetic and functional data presented in this thesis established the roles of SnogE as the GT performing the C 7 O-glycosyl transfer of the nogalose moiety and SnogD as the O-GT attaching the nogalamine moiety onto the C 1 carbon. The activity of SnogD was verified in vitro using recombinant protein, following establishment of a transglycosylation-like assay. The three-dimensional structure of the homo-dimeric SnogD was determined to 2. 6 Å and consists of a GT-B fold. Mutagenesis of two active site residues, His 25 and His 301, evaluated in vitro and in vivo, suggested His 25 to be the catalytic base, activating the acceptor substrate by proton abstraction from the C 1 -hydroxyl group. His 301 provides a positive charge to stabilise the negative charge formed close to the diphosphate of the leaving group during glycosyl transfer. Genetic, functional and structural data together suggest the involvement of an additional or altogether different enzyme for the C-C bond formation. The bifunctional enzyme aldos- 2 -ulose dehydratase (AUDH) from Phanerochaete chrysosporium catalyses the dehydration and isomerisation of the secondary metabolites <b>glucosone</b> and 1, 5 -anhydro-D-fructose (AF) into the antimicrobial compounds cortalcerone and microthecin (Mic), respectively. The threedimensional structure of the dimeric AUDH was determined to 2. 0 Å. The enzyme consists of a seven bladed ß-propeller, two cupin folds and a lectin-like domain, in a novel combination. Two structural metal ions, Mg 2 + and Zn 2 +, are bound in loop regions. Two additional zinc ions are present {{at the base of}} two putative active sites, located in the ß-propeller and the second cupin fold. The specific removal of these zinc ions eliminated catalytic activity, proving the metal dependency of the overall reaction. The structure of AUDH in complex with the reaction intermediate ascopyrone M bound at both putative active sites, and a complex of zinc-depleted enzyme with AF bound in the cupin fold have been determined by X-ray crystallography to 2. 6 and 2. 8 Å resolution, respectively. These observations support the presence of two distinct active sites located 60 Å apart, partly connected by an intra-dimeric channel. The dehydration reaction most likely follows an elimination reaction with the zinc ion acting as a Lewis acid to polarise the C 2 keto group of AF. Abstraction of the C 3 proton by the suitably located residue His 155 would generate an enol intermediate, which is stabilised by the zinc ion. Return of the proton to the C 4 hydroxyl group would generate a favourable leaving group...|$|E
