25|$|Originally, <b>Group</b> <b>Policies</b> were {{modified}} {{using the}} Group Policy Edit tool that was integrated with Active Directory Users and Computers Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in, {{but it was}} later split into a separate MMC snap-in called the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC).

500|$|Microsoft {{was criticized}} for the tactics that it used to promote its free upgrade {{campaign}} for Windows 10, including adware-like behaviours, using deceptive user interfaces to coax users into installing the operating system, downloading installation files without user consent, and {{making it difficult for}} users to suppress the advertising and notifications if they did not wish to upgrade to 10. The upgrade offer was marketed and initiated using the [...] "Get Windows 10" [...] (GWX) application, which was first downloaded and installed via Windows Update in March 2015. Registry keys and <b>group</b> <b>policies</b> could be used to partially disable the GWX mechanism, but the installation of patches to the GWX software via Windows Update could reset these keys back to defaults, and thus reactivate the software. Third-party programs were also created to assist users in applying measures to disable GWX.|$|E
50|$|Windows Vista {{includes}} around 2400 <b>Group</b> <b>Policy</b> settings, {{which allow}} administrators to specify configuration for connected groups of computers, {{especially in a}} domain. Windows Vista supports Multiple Local <b>Group</b> <b>Policy</b> Objects which allows setting different levels of Local <b>Group</b> <b>Policy</b> for individual users. A new XML based policy definition file format, known as ADMX has been introduced. ADMX files contain the configuration settings for individual <b>Group</b> <b>Policy</b> Objects (GPO). For domain based GPOs, the ADMX files can be centrally stored, and all computers on the domain will retrieve them to configure themselves, using the File Replication Service, {{which is used to}} replicate files on a configured system from a remote location. The <b>Group</b> <b>Policy</b> service is no longer attached with the Winlogon service, rather it runs as a service on its own. <b>Group</b> <b>Policy</b> event messages are now logged in the system event log. <b>Group</b> <b>Policy</b> uses Network Location Awareness to refresh the policy configuration as soon as a network configuration change is detected.|$|R

2500|$|Local <b>Group</b> <b>Policy</b> (LGP, or LocalGPO) is a {{more basic}} version of <b>Group</b> <b>Policy</b> for {{standalone}} and non-domain computers, that has existed at least since Windows XP Home Edition, and {{can be applied to}} domain computers. Prior to Windows Vista, LGP could enforce a <b>Group</b> <b>Policy</b> Object for a single local computer, but could not make policies for individual users or groups. From Windows Vista onward, LGP allow Local <b>Group</b> <b>Policy</b> management for individual users and groups as well, and also allows backup, importing and exporting of policies between standalone machines via [...] "GPO Packs" [...] â€“ <b>group</b> <b>policy</b> containers which include the files needed to import the policy to the destination machine.|$|R
