5|$|The film {{returns to}} the opening scene. Tommy breaks down in tears but stops crying when, upon {{catching}} sight of a mirror, he sees the image of Marty standing behind him. He finishes dressing for the fight and, as <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ring, hears Stephanie calling to him. He turns to her; they smile. He resumes his walk to the ring and the camera pulls back to reveal that he is dressed in Marty's old ring robe in tribute.|$|E
500|$|Afterward, Joffrey lies to the courtly entourage and accuses Arya and her direwolf of ganging up on him. Unwilling to lose {{favor with}} her betrothed by {{publicly}} exposing his lie, Sansa claims she remembers nothing. Sick of the petty bickering, King Robert chastises his son for allowing {{himself to be}} disarmed by the younger girl and declares that the fathers themselves will punish their respective children, dismissing the audience. However, Robert gives in to his wife Cersei's demands and orders the direwolf killed. Since Nymeria has fled, Sansa's wolf, Lady, is to be sacrificed. Unable to convince the king otherwise, Eddard takes responsibility for killing Sansa's pet himself. As <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> back of the inn, he encounters Joffrey's bodyguard, Sandor [...] "The Hound" [...] Clegane, who has ridden down the butcher's boy and brought in his bloody corpse for the prince.|$|E
500|$|Early {{the next}} morning, Nick fills a jar with 50 dew-heavy {{grasshoppers}} found under a log he names a [...] "grasshopper lodging-house", eats breakfast, drinks sweetened coffee {{and makes a}} sliced onion sandwich. After checking and assembling his fly fishing rod and tying on damp leader line, <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> river with a net hanging from his belt, a sack {{over his shoulder and}} the jar of grasshoppers dangling around his neck. Wading in the water, he fishes the shallows; he lands a trout that [...] "was mottled with clear, water-over-gravel color" [...] that he releases. Moving into a pool of deeper water, he hooks a large trout, [...] "as broad as a salmon", which he loses. After a rest, he moves away from the pool to the more shallow center of the river and catches two trout that he stows in his sack. Sitting on a log, smoking a cigarette and eating his onion sandwich, he thinks about fishing the deep water of the swamp, but decides to wait for another day. At the log in the river, he kills, guts and cleans the two trout before returning to camp.|$|E

60|$|She did not reply, and <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{window and}} {{looked out on the}} garden.|$|R

500|$|... "The Chinese Restaurant" [...] {{was first}} read by its cast on December 5, 1990, {{and it was}} filmed on December 11. Filming took place at CBS Studio Center in Studio City, Los Angeles, California, where all filming for the second season took place. As only one {{location}} was used, it took roughly half {{of the time it}} usually took for an episode to be filmed. Cast members have remarked that the filming was shorter than on any other episode. A few changes were made; in the first draft of the script, George, Jerry, and Elaine entered the restaurant talking about their least favorite holiday. In the version that aired, they talk about combining the jobs of policemen and garbagemen into a single job. In the original draft, the three friends also discussed how to spend the long waiting period in the future, with George suggesting they bring a deck of cards and that Jerry bring a jigsaw puzzle with nothing but penguins. One scene was cut before broadcast, featuring George explaining to Jerry that he pulled his hamstring while trying to untuck the covers of a hotel bed during his recent stay in Boston. George can be seen grabbing his hamstring as <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> phone. The scene was later included on the Seinfeld seasons one and two DVD boxset.|$|E
6000|$|NICHOLLS (springing to his feet--furiously). That's a----! (He {{controls}} {{himself with}} an effort. His voice trembles.) You're {{not responsible for}} the idiotic things you're saying or I'd---- (He turns away, seeking some escape from the old man's tongue.) I'll see if the man is still there with the carriage. (<b>He</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door on left and goes out.) ...|$|E
6000|$|LADY CHESHIRE {{suddenly}} rises, looking {{towards the}} billiard-room [...] door, listening. They all follow her eyes. She sits down [...] again, passing {{her hand over}} her lips, as SIR WILLIAM enters. [...] His hunting clothes are splashed; his face very grim and set. [...] <b>He</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fore without a glance at any one, and stands [...] looking down into it. Very quietly, every one but LADY CHESHIRE [...] steals away.|$|E
60|$|And then <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{table and}} poured a stiff drink of Scotch into a glass.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> writing-table as <b>he</b> spoke, drew a {{chair to}} it, {{and opened the}} paper case.|$|R
60|$|She rose to {{her feet}} and <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door with her. On the way she hesitated.|$|R
6000|$|... (<b>He</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> window, and {{the others}} are going out by the door. But they do not go. There is a hitch somewhere--at the window apparently, for DEARTH, having begun to draw the {{curtains}} apart lets them fall, like one who has had a shock. The others remember long afterwards his grave face as he came quietly back and put his cigar on the table. The room is in darkness save for the light from one lamp.) ...|$|E
60|$|There {{were many}} who came {{regularly}} to inquire of him, and each afternoon I {{would see the}} broad shoulders and genial face of Governor Sharpe in the gateway, completing his walk by way of Marlboro' Street. I loved and admired him, for {{he had been a}} soldier himself before he came out to us, and had known and esteemed my father. His Excellency should surely have been knighted for his services in the French war. Once he spied me at the window and shook his cane pleasantly, and in <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> room where I sat reading of the victories of Blenheim and Malplaquet, for chronicles of this sort I delighted in.|$|E
60|$|On {{the brow}} of a grassy slope dotted over with mimosa thorns, {{and close to}} a gushing stream of water, stands a house, or rather a hut, built of green brick and {{thatched}} with grass. Behind this hut is a fence of thorns, rough but strong, designed to protect all within it from the attacks of lions and other beasts of prey. At present, save for a solitary mule eating its provender by {{the wheel of a}} tented ox-waggon, it is untenanted, for the cattle have not yet been kraaled for the night. Presently Thomas Owen enters this enclosure by {{the back door of the}} hut, and having attended to the mule, which whinnies at the sight of him, goes to the gate and watches there till he sees his native boys driving the cattle up the slope of the hill. At length they arrive, and when he has counted them to make sure that none are missing, and in a few kind words commended the herds for their watchfulness, <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front of the house and, seating himself upon a wooden stool set under a mimosa tree that grows near the door, he looks earnestly towards the west.|$|E
60|$|There was no reply, and <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bunk {{softly and}} pulled the {{blankets}} over the engineer.|$|R
60|$|His voice choked. <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, stood a moment, came back. His {{eyes were}} full of tears.|$|R
60|$|Granet {{closed the}} {{cupboard}} slowly. Then <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> window for a moment, {{his hands behind}} his back.|$|R
60|$|Her laugh is {{very like}} David's, whom I could punch {{all day in}} order to hear him laugh. I dare say she put this laugh into him. She has been putting qualities into David, {{altering}} him, turning him forever on a lathe since the day she first knew him, and indeed long before, and all so deftly that he is still called a child of nature. When you release David's hand he is immediately lost like an arrow from the bow. No sooner do you cast eyes on him than you are thinking of birds. It is {{difficult to believe that}} <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kensington Gardens; he always seems to have alighted there: and were I to scatter crumbs I opine he would come and peck. This is not what he set out to be; it is all the doing of that timid-looking lady who affects to be greatly surprised by it. He strikes a hundred gallant poses in a day; when he tumbles, which is often, he comes to the ground like a Greek god; so Mary A---- has willed it. But how she suffers that he may achieve! I have seen him climbing a tree while she stood beneath in unutterable anguish; she had to let him climb, for boys must be brave, but I am sure that, as she watched him, she fell from every branch.|$|E
6000|$|... "So he {{flew off}} and fetched another acorn {{and dropped it}} in, and tried to flirt his eye to the hole quick enough to see what become of it, {{but he was too}} late. He held his eye there as much as a minute; then he raised up and sighed, and says, 'Confound it, I don't seem to {{understand}} this thing, no way; however, I'll tackle her again.' He fetched another acorn, and done his level best to see what become of it, but he couldn't. He says, 'Well, I never struck no such a hole as this before; I'm of the opinion it's a totally new kind of a hole.' Then he begun to get mad. He held in for a spell, walking up and down the comb of the roof and shaking his head and muttering to himself; but his feelings got the upper hand of him, presently, and he broke loose and cussed himself black in the face. I never see a bird take on so about a little thing. When he got through <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hole and looks in again for half a minute; then he says, 'Well, you're a long hole, and a deep hole, and a mighty singular hole altogether--but I've started in to fill you, and I'm damned if I DON'T fill you, if it takes a hundred years!' ...|$|E
5000|$|Shinnosuke Abe of the Yomiuri Giants {{uses the}} song as his {{entrance}} music as <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> batter's box.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy put {{his hands}} in his pockets, and turned away. <b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mantelpiece, and leaned his back against it.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{other side}} of the ring and {{repeated}} the remark. A raucous welcome was accorded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> new member.|$|R
60|$|Elbridge drove first <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{stable and}} put up his horse, when he came back. Then <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lodge <b>to</b> report.|$|R
50|$|Casey {{drives to}} Kathleen's house {{to meet with}} her. As <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, Kathleen (Clare Carey), Morgan, and Alex come out with an older man. Casey realizes that Kathleen has moved on and, happy for her, decides to leave her alone.|$|E
50|$|Samboy is {{the only}} player known to get applauses and {{standing}} ovation from fans (even fans from the opposing team) as <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> scoring table to enter the game. He also gets a thundering roar from the crowd whenever he touches the ball.|$|E
50|$|Eleven years later, Pip {{returns to}} England to see Joe, Biddy and their children. <b>He</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> land where Satis House once stood and meets Estella there. Both have changed much from their {{experience}} of life. After they reconcile, they hold hands, and Pip sees no shadow to part them again.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked around}} for an instant. Then <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> roadside, ran in among the trees and bushes, and {{disappeared}} from view.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door. Mr. Percy Linwood dropped Doctor Lagarde's hand, and appealed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{retiring}} Captain {{with a broad}} stare of astonishment.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> galley. “Cooky, by {{the time}} you’ve {{finished}} pots and pans you’ll be wanted on deck. Stand ready for a call.” ...|$|R
5000|$|The game finishes, with England {{winning the}} Ashes, and Slartibartfast joins Arthur and Ford. Slartibartfast {{explains}} that he has arrived because [...] "something terrible is about to happen". <b>He</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> centre of the cricket pitch, and asks {{to be given the}} Ashes saying that they are [...] "vitally important for the past, present and future safety of the Galaxy".|$|E
50|$|Once again a {{red light}} is seen {{surrounded}} by the dark tunnel. Zac finds himself lying face down on a beach. There are strange cloud formations, resembling waterspouts, {{rising out of the}} ocean. As <b>he</b> <b>walks</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> water's edge, an enormous ringed planet slowly appears over the horizon. Zac stares in disbelief, then realises he is still holding his tape recorder. He lifts it up as if to speak, then lowers it, completely bewildered.|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, as if {{he could}} hardly trust his temper if he {{answered}} her--stopped--and, thinking better of it, turned toward her again.|$|R
