5|$|The kulintang player’s {{ability to}} improvise within the {{parameters}} of a rhythmic mode is a must. As with gamelan orchestras, each kulintang mode <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of theme the kulintang player “dresses up” by variations of ornamentation, manipulating segments by inserting repetitions, extensions, insertions, suspensions, variations and transpositions. This occurs {{at the discretion of}} the kulintang player. Therefore, the kulintang player functions not only as the one carrying the melody, but also as the conductor of the entire ensemble. She determines the length of each rendition and could change the rhythm at any time, speeding up or slowing down, accord to her personal taste and the composition she plays.|$|E
5|$|Another steep climb of 800 feet {{brought us}} to the Marei Parei spur, {{to the spot where}} the ground was covered with the {{magnificent}} pitcher-plants, of which we had come in search. This one has been called the Nepenthes Rajah, and is a plant about four feet in length, with broad leaves stretching on every side, having the great pitchers resting on the ground in a circle about it. Their shape and size are remarkable. I will give the measurement of one, to indicate the form: the length along the back nearly fourteen inches; from the base {{to the top of the}} column in front, five inches; and its lid a foot long by fourteen inches broad, and of an oval shape. Its mouth was surrounded by a plaited pile, which near the column was two inches broad, lessening in its narrowest part to three-quarters of an inch. The plaited pile of the mouth was also undulating in broad waves. Near the stem the pitcher is four inches deep, so that the mouth is situated upon it in a triangular manner. The colour of an old chalice is a deep purple, but that of the others is generally mauve outside, very dark indeed in the lower part, though lighter towards the rim; the inside is of the same colour, but <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of glazed and shiny appearance. The lid is mauve in the centre, shading to green at the edges. The stems of the female flowers we found always a foot shorter than those of the male, and the former were far less numerous than the latter. It is indeed one of the most astonishing productions of nature.|$|E

She is intelligent and observant, noticing and formulating theories about the Cullens' strange behaviors, physical features, and unusual abilities. As the novel progresses, Bella unconsciously learns how to make difficult choices and accept their consequences.|$|E

25|$|What {{is unusual}} about Cutolo {{is that he}} <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of ideology, another factor that appealed to rootless and badly educated youths. He founded the NCO in his home town Ottaviano on October 24, 1970, the day of Cutolo's patron saint, San Raffaele. In such a way Cutolo created the most {{powerful}} organization ever {{to exist in the}} Neapolitan hinterland. Using his personal appeal and almost magic charisma, he was able to achieve this single-handedly. Cutolo had strong ties with the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta. According to some pentiti, Cutolo's career started with his affiliation with the 'Ndrangheta, supported by important bosses such as Piromalli, Paolo De Stefano, and Mammoliti. Cutolo based his organisation of the NCO on the model of the 'Ndrangheta, its internal codes and rituals.|$|E

500|$|Post-production {{was handled}} by Montreal's Meteor Studios and Hybride Technologies {{filled in the}} bluescreen footage with more than 1,500 visual effects shots. Visual effects {{supervisor}} Chris Watts and production designer Jim Bissell created a process dubbed [...] "The Crush," [...] which allowed the Meteor artists to manipulate the colors by increasing the contrast of light and dark.

Ghislain St-Pierre, who led the team of artists, described the effect: [...] "Everything looks realistic, but it <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of a gritty illustrative feel."

Although all the fight sequences were carefully controlled for safety, some were choreographed to be more haphazard than others; each fighter was also given their own style for variety and humour. [...] Liz May Brice (Herrena) noted the contrast in the ferry fight sequence, saying [...] "the way we've done the fight, he [...] is almost [...] by mistake... it's sort of fun, whereas [...] is very deliberate".|$|E

[...] Director Gavin Hood commented on Gregson-Williams' style, saying: [...] "Harry's challenge is to give us operatic scale, but also keep it intimate and human.

Korn asked Ross Robinson to produce, and wanted to begin recording at Indigo Ranch, mostly because their first album had been recorded there and was a success. Authors Jason Arnopp and Doug Small, insisted the album was rushed when it was put together. Silveria explained, [...] "We went in really fresh, and we wanted to get it done quickly to capture that moment. So it was probably about sixty percent knowing what I was going to play and forty percent just playing whatever came to mind at that moment, It ended up really good, and it <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of energy I probably wouldn't have gotten if I'd worked everything out beforehand."

500|$|... — A {{friend of}} both the Hero and Kiefer, Maribel is the {{daughter}} of the mayor of Fishbel. Unlike Kiefer, who has steadfastly refused to let his social status influence how he looks upon other people, Maribel tends to be a bit condescending, even bossy. Despite this, she <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind,</b> sentimental side and gets along well with her friends, and occasionally accompanies them on their adventuring, even if she sometimes has to pressure them into letting her tag along. Maribel is primarily a magic user: with low starting physical statistics, and an early lack of powerful weapons available for her use, it takes {{a good deal of time}} before she can do anything approaching the amount of physical damage inflicted by some of the other characters. On the other hand, Maribel has access to a variety of damaging attack spells relatively early on. She is forced to leave the party when her father falls ill, but unlike Kiefer, she can rejoin them later on.|$|E
500|$|Three {{months after}} the release of Goodbye Lullaby (2011), Lavigne {{announced}} that work on her fifth studio album had already begun, having eight songs written. Lavigne stated that the album would musically be the opposite of Goodbye Lullaby, with a release date rumoured for sometime in 2012. Lavigne explained, [...] "Goodbye Lullaby was more mellow, [...] the next one will be pop and more fun again. I already have a song that I know {{is going to be a}} single, I just need to re-record it!." [...] In an interview, Lavigne said about her collaboration with Kroeger: [...] "I have a song called Hello Kitty, which I wrote about Hello Kitty because I'm obsessed, and it's a really fun thing that I've never done before.

Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly said [...] "Pilot" [...] lacked the [...] "snap and clear character delineation" [...] of The Office, but pointed out that show also appeared flat in early episodes; Tucker said he liked the performances, attitude and atmosphere of the show, although it had few laugh out loud moments. Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe said the show has the potential to become a [...] "flip, witty political allegory" [...] and praised Poehler and the supporting cast. Los Angeles Times television critic Robert Lloyd praised the show for providing strong female leads, which he said was rare on television.

500|$|At Peking Airport, contingents of the Chinese {{military}} {{await the}} arrival of the American presidential aircraft [...] "Spirit of '76", carrying Nixon and his party. The military chorus sings the Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention. After the aircraft touches down, Nixon emerges with Pat Nixon and Henry Kissinger. The president exchanges stilted greetings with the Chinese premier, Chou En-lai, who heads the welcoming party. Nixon speaks of the historical significance of the visit, and of his hopes and fears for the encounter ("News <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of mystery"). The scene changes to Chairman Mao's study, where the Chairman awaits {{the arrival of}} the presidential party. Nixon and Kissinger enter with Chou, and Mao and the president converse in banalities as photographers record the scene. In the discussion that follows, the westerners are confused by Mao's gnomic and frequently impenetrable comments, which are amplified by his secretaries and often by Chou. The scene changes again, to the evening's banquet in the Great Hall of the People. Chou toasts the American visitors ("We have begun to celebrate the different ways") and Nixon responds ("I have attended many feasts"), after which the toasts continue as the atmosphere becomes increasingly convivial. Nixon, a politician who rose to prominence on anti-communism, announces: [...] "Everyone, listen; just let me say one thing. I opposed China, I was wrong".|$|E
500|$|Love's Last Shift {{can be seen}} as {{an early}} sign of Cibber's {{sensitivity}} to shifts of public opinion, which was to be useful to him in his later career as manager at Drury Lane (see Colley Cibber). In the 1690s, the economic and political power balance of the nation tilted from the aristocracy towards the middle class after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and middle-class values of religion, morality, and gender roles became more dominant, not least in attitudes to the stage. Love's Last Shift {{is one of the first}} illustrations of a massive shift in audience taste, away from the analytic bent and sexual frankness of Restoration comedy and towards the conservative certainties and gender role backlash of exemplary or sentimental comedy. The play illustrates Cibber's opportunism at a moment in time before the change was assured: fearless of self-contradiction, he puts something into his first play to please every section of the audience, combining the old outspokenness with the new preachiness. The way Vanbrugh, in his turn, allows the reformed rake to relapse quite cheerfully, and has the only preaching in the play come from the comically corrupt parson of [...] "Fatgoose Living", has made some early 20th-century critics refer to The Relapse as the last of the true Restoration comedies. However, Vanbrugh's play is also affected by the taste of the 1690s, and compared to a play like the courtier William Wycherley's The Country Wife of 20 years earlier, with its celebration of predatory aristocratic masculinity, The Relapse contains quite a few moments of morality and uplift. In fact it <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of parallel structure to Love's Last Shift: in the climactic scene of Cibber's play, Amanda's virtue reforms her husband, and in the corresponding scene of The Relapse, it reforms her admirer Worthy. Such moments have not done the play any favours with modern critics.|$|E
