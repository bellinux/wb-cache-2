50|$|As a {{first step}} of {{processing}} finger millet can be milled to produce flour. However, finger millet is difficult to mill due to {{the small size of}} the seeds and because the bran is bound very tightly to the endosperm. Furthermore, the delicate seed can get crushed during the milling. The development of commercial mechanical milling systems for finger millet is challenging. Therefore, the main product of finger millet is whole grain flour. This has disadvantages, such as reduced storage time of the flour due to the high oil content. Furthermore, the industrial use of whole <b>grain</b> <b>finger</b> millet flour is limited. Recently a new milling system was developed in India, which is able to grind finger millet grains. This milling system is called Mini Millet Mill. The Mini Millet Mill takes into account the traditional knowledge of the farmers and moistens the seeds half an hour before grinding. Moistening the millet seeds prior to grinding helps to remove the bran mechanically without causing damage {{to the rest of the}} seed. The mini millet mill can also be used to process other grains such as wheat and sorghum. The Mini Millet Mill could be promising as it yields white flour which can be commercially used.|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{agricultural}} productivity through {{the dissemination of}} improved cropping practices {{remains one of the}} biggest challenges of this century. A considerable amount of literature is dedicated to the adoption of improved cropping practices among smallholder farmers in developing countries. While most studies focus on cash crops or main staple crops, traditional food <b>grains</b> like <b>finger</b> millet have received little attention in the past decades. The present study aims to assess the factors that are influencing adoption decisions among finger millet farmers in Western Kenya. Based on cross-sectional household data from 270 farmers, we estimate a multivariate probit model to compare the adoption decisions in finger millet and maize production. While improved practices such as the use of a modern variety or chemical fertilizer are well known in maize production, they are less common in finger millet production. Results show that social networks as well as access to extension services play a crucial role in the adoption of improved finger millet practices, while the same variables are of minor importance for the adoption of improved maize practices. A Cobb-Douglas production function shows a positive effect of modern varieties and chemical fertilizer on finger millet yields...|$|R

The study was based on the estimation of Modulus of elasticity and Modulus of rupture under static bending and Maximum Crushing Stress and Modulus of elasticity under compression parallel to <b>grain</b> of <b>finger</b> jointed sections and comparing them with the values measured for clear wood sections from the same lot. For joining the sections, the Poly Vinyl Acetate and Urea Formaldehyde adhesives were used. It was found that the Modulus of elasticity of the sections joined by either adhesive showed significantly better values than that of unjointed clear wood sections. The Modulus of rupture values of sections joined with Urea Formaldehyde were similar to those of unjointed clear wood sections. However, sections jointed with Poly Vinyl Acetate adhesive exhibited lower Modulus of rupture. Under compression, the parameters of the jointed sections joined with either adhesive were either similar or better than those of the unjointed clear wood sections. The study demonstrates the utility of finger jointing of mango wood sections for furniture parts especially with the Urea Formaldehyde adhesive...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of {{association}} between traits and heritability {{is important in}} breeding for purposes of effective trait selection. Such information on finger millet in east Africa is very limited. This study was intended to determine the association and heritability for 19 quantitative traits of 340 finger millet landraces from Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda and 80 global minicore accessions from ICRISAT Genebank in India. There were inherent strong genetic relationships among most traits {{as evidenced by the}} higher genotypic than phenotypic correlations. Grain yield had high, positive correlations with finger width (rg = 0. 876), grains per spikelet (rg = 0. 623), threshing percent (rg = 0. 677), peduncle length (rg = 0. 517) and panicle exertion (rg = 0. 571). These traits could be considered for grain yield selection. Path coefficient analysis revealed that productive tillers per plant (0. 473), 1000 grain mass (0. 136), grains per spikelet (0. 131) and threshing percent (0. 118) had positive, direct effects on grain yield. Due consideration should be placed on these traits when selecting for grain yield improvement in finger millet. There were also strong, positive indirect effects contributed to <b>grain</b> yield by <b>finger</b> width, peduncle length, panicle exertion and leaf sheath width. It will be necessary to simultaneously select for these traits together with those with strong positive, direct effects on grain yield in order to improve <b>grain</b> yield in <b>finger</b> millet.

40|$|Finger millets (or ragi) are cereals and {{the staple}} food of the {{millions}} residing in the arid and semi-arid tropics of the world. The <b>grains</b> of <b>finger</b> millets, being nutritionally superior to wheat provide Carbohydrates, dietary fibers, minerals and vitamins to {{poorest of the poor}} where the need is essential. Finger millet can be regarded as a functional food, to be taken as part of the usual diet in order to have beneficial effects that go beyond basic nutritional function, thus helping {{to reduce the risk of}} obesity, malnutrition, and premature aging. An important factor of the functional food which is required to reduce the risk of chronic illnesses is ‘proper intake and antibacterial activity’. Antibacterial is used to treat bacterial infections, Germinated finger millet seeds extract (12 hour sample) has a bactericidal property against Escherichia coli and can be consumed for management of infectious diarrhoea. However prolonged use of certain antibacterial can decrease the number of gut flora, which may have a negative impact on health. Results indicate that potential exists to utilize finger millet as an alternative natural antioxidant and food preservative.

40|$|Three {{hundred and}} twenty two finger millet (Eleusine coracanu (L.) Gaertn.) {{germplasm}} accessions collected from Zimbabwe were evaluated at Aisleby and Henderson during the 1988 / 89 and 1989 / 90 rainy seasons. The data were recorded on grain yield and nine morphological traits to study the genetic variability and the heritability for each trait {{as well as the}} genetic and phenotypic correlations between traits. Differences between finger millet accessions for <b>grain</b> yield, <b>finger</b> length, finger width, number of fingers per head, 1000 grain weight and threshing percentage were significant at both locations, while differences in finger yield and number of productive tillers per plant were significant only at Aisleby. Number of days to flowering and plant height were recorded only at Aisleby and the differences among accessions were significant. Heritability in the broad sense for days to flowering was high (0. 60). those for finger length. threshing percentage and 1000 grain weight were moderate (0. 2 1 to 0. 46), whereas the estimates were low (0. 0 I to 0. 29) {{for the rest of the}} traits.

50|$|Finger millet is {{generally}} seen as not very prone to diseases and pests. Nonetheless, finger millet blast, {{caused by the}} fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea (anamorph Pyricularia grisea), can locally cause severe damages, especially when untreated. In Uganda, yield losses up to 80% were reported in bad years. The pathogen leads to drying out of leaves, neck rots and ear rots. These symptoms can drastically impair photosynthesis, translocation of photosynthetic assimilates and grain filling and therefore reduce yield and <b>grain</b> quality. <b>Finger</b> millet blast can also infest finger millet weeds such as the closely related Eleusine indica, Eleusine africana or Digitaria spp., Setaria spp. and Doctylocterium spp. Finger millet blast can be controlled with cultural measures, chemical treatments {{and the use of}} resistant varieties. Cultural measures to control finger millet blast suggested by ICRISAT for Eastern Africa include crop rotations with non-host crops like legumes, deep ploughing under of finger millet straw on infected fields, washing of field tools after use to prevent dissemination of the pathogen to non-infected fields, weed control to reduce infections by weed hosts and avoiding of too high plant densities to impede the pathogen dispersal from plant to plant. Chemical measures can be direct spraying of systemic fungicides, such as the active ingredients pyroquilon or tricyclazone or seed dressings with fungicides like trycyclozole.|$|R
40|$|Phosphorus is {{important}} for finger millet production in many tropical African soils with low phosphorus fertility. Knowledge of redirection of this limited resource for reproduction is fundamental in realization of potential yields. The effect of four phosphorus levels (0, 12. 5, 25. 0 and 37. 5 kg ha- 1 P 2 O 5) and three varieties (U- 15, P- 224 and a local check) on the days to flowering and maturity of finger millet were evaluated in three agro-ecologies in Kenya during the raining seasons of 2014 - 2015. Phosphorus application significantly (P< 0. 05) increased early flowering and physiological maturity in Kakamega and Busia. The varieties elicited significantly different days to 50 % flowering and maturation periods in all the study sites. The days to flowering and maturity {{were found to be}} lowly but negatively correlated with the <b>grain</b> yield of <b>finger</b> millet in all the sites...|$|R

40|$|The small <b>grain</b> cereal, <b>finger</b> millet (FM, Eleusine coracana L. Gaertn), {{is valued}} by {{subsistence}} farmers in India and East Africa as a low-input crop. It is reported by farmers to require no added nitrogen, or only residual N, to produce grain. Exact mechanisms underlying the acclimation responses of FM to low N are largely unknown, both {{above and below}} ground. In particular, the responses of FM roots and root hairs to N or any other nutrient have not previously been reported. Given its low N requirement, FM also provides {{a rare opportunity to}} study long-term responses to N starvation in a cereal. The objective {{of this study was to}} survey the shoot and root morphometric responses of FM, including root hairs, to low N stress. Plants were grown in pails in a semi-hydroponic system on clay containing extremely low background N, supplemented with N or no N. To our surprise, plants grown without deliberately added N grew to maturity, looked relatively normal and produced healthy seed heads. Plants responded to the low N treatment by decreasing shoot, root and seed head biomass. These declines under low N were associated with decreased shoot tiller number, crown root number, total crown root length and total lateral root length, but with no consistent changes in root hair traits. Changes in tiller and crown root number appeared to coordinate the above and below ground acclimation responses to N. We discuss the remarkable ability of FM to grow to maturity without deliberately added N. The results suggest that FM should be further explored to understand this trait. Our observations are consistent with indigenous knowledge from subsistence farmers in Africa and Asia that this crop can survive extreme environments...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a method of applying a net-like finger grid to the front side of multicrystalline (mc) silicon solar cells, which lies mainly on the grain boundaries (<b>Grain</b> Boundary Oriented <b>Finger</b> grid, GBOF grid). This net has no busbars. It is drawn by a plotter using screen printing paste. The efficiency of cells contacted in this manner has been tested in a comparative study of pairs and triplets of cells of size 100 x 100 mm 2 (Bayer) and 103 x 103 mm 2 (Eurosolare). In the pairs-study pairs of neighbouring wafers of the original ingot were processed into solar cells. One wafer received a GBOF-grid, the other got the same grid rotated by 90 degrees and so had little coverage of grain boundaries. In the triplets study a third neighbouring wafer was added and equipped with a standard H-pattern of the same shading as the GBOF-grid. Many pairs and triplets were made. The pairs study showed that the GBOF-grid gives solar cells with 3. 7 % more output, on average, under approximately standard conditions.

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 The {{reinforcement}} {{of wood and}} wood composite structural products to improve their mechanical properties has been in practice for many years. Recently, the use of high-strength fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) as a reinforcement in such applications has been commercialized. The reinforcement is manufactured using a standard pultrusion process or alternatively a sheet-forming process {{commonly referred to as}} "pulfonning". The high-modulus fibers are predominately unidirectional, although off-axis fibers are often used to enhance off-axis properties. The fibers used are either of a single type or multiple types, which are called "hybrids". Unidirectional, single, and hybrid fiber FRP physical properties and characteristics were compared to wood. Full-scale reinforced glulams were tested. Aramid-reinforced plastics (ARP) used as tensile reinforcements were found to be superior in strength applications to other types of FRP made with fiber, such as carbon and fiberglass. Carbon/aramid-reinforced plastic (CARP) was shown to be superior in both modulus and strength design situations. Fiberglass was shown to be suitable only in hybrid situations with another fiber such as aramid or carbon and only in limited use situations where modulus was a design criteria. The testing and analysis showed that the global response of reinforced glulam beams is controlled by localized strength variations in the wood such as slope of <b>grain,</b> knots, <b>finger</b> joints, etc. in the tensile zone. The elemental tensile strains in the extreme wood tensile laminae, due to global applied loads, were found to be well below the strain at failure in clear wood samples recovered from the failure area. Two areas affecting the relationship between the wood and the FRP were investigated: compatibility of the wood and FRP materials and interface characteristics between the wood and FRP. The optimum strain value at yield point for an FRP was assessed to be slightly higher than the clear wood value in tension for a species/grade to be reinforced. The effects of localized strength variations in the tensile wood laminae adjacent to the FRP were found to be the predominate cause of failure in frill-scale reinforced glulams with less than 1. 5...|$|R
40|$|We present new {{results of}} putting the {{metallic}} front contact pattern of multicrystalline silicon solar cells over and along grain boundaries (<b>Grain</b> Boundary Oriented <b>Finger</b> grid – GBOF-grid). In a previous study the contacts were formed by automated grain boundary detection and writing of the contact pattern with ordinary screen printing paste. Now we used a galvanic method with nickel as a diffusion barrier and silver as the conductor, in view of a possible application in laser grooved buried contact cells. This gave very low contact and series resistances. Using Baysix ® 100 x 100 -wafers, we compared so called ON-cells, which received the GBOF-grid so that the front contacts ran mostly along grain boundaries, OFF-cells, where the same pattern was used but was rotated by 90 ° to give only little coverage of grain boundaries, STD-cells with the H-pattern of most commercial silicon solar cells, and GRD-cells with a geometric rectangular grid pattern. With the same total shading on all four kinds of patterns, a clear advantage for the grain boundary contacted ON-cells is found, exceeding {{the results of the}} previous study. Under approximately standard conditions, ON-cells gave at least 5 % more power than the STD-cells and in some batches over 10 % more.

The objectives of this research were {{to determine the effects}} of (a) season-long, and short episodes of high temperature stress on growth and yield traits of finger millet, (b) seeding rates and nitrogen fertilizer application rates on grain and biomass yield, and (c) to evaluate the finger millet minicore collection for high grain and biomass yield. Controlled environment studies were conducted {{to determine the effects of}} high temperature stress on physiological, growth and yield traits. Field studies were conducted in Manhattan and Hays (Kansas) and Alupe (Kenya) to determine the effects of seeding and nitrogen fertilizer rates on growth and yield traits. Finger millet minicore collection was evaluated under field conditions in India, for phenology, growth and yield traits. Season long high temperature stress of 36 / 26 or 38 / 28 °C compared to 32 / 22 °C decreased panicle emergence, number of seeds per panicle, grain yield and harvest index. Finger millet was most sensitive to short episodes (10 d) of high temperature (40 / 30 °C) during booting, panicle emergence and flowering stages, resulting in lower number of seeds, and <b>grain</b> yield. <b>Finger</b> millet responded to the interaction between environmental (locations) and temporal (years) factors. In general, locations with higher rainfall had greater grain and biomass yield than those with low rainfall. There was no influence of seeding rates (3. 2 or 6. 0 kg ha[superscript]- 1) at Hays and Alupe. However, in one of the two years in Manhattan, higher seeding rate of 6. 0 kg ha[superscript]- 1 increased grain yield compared to 3. 2 kg ha[superscript]- 1. There was no influence of nitrogen rates (0, 30, 60 or 90 kg ha[superscript]- 1) on grain or biomass yield at all three locations. However, higher fertilizer rates had greater percentage lodging.

Main objective of this study is to find the most suitable finger joint length and type of adhesive through experimental results to have better efficient structural performance. Tests such as bending, compression (grain parallel and perpendicular), tension (parallel to grain) and shear perpendicular to grain were conducted. For these tests BS 373 : 1957 and EURO CODE 5 were used as standards for tests. In Sri Lanka Hardwood class timber waste is generated in more than other classes. Therefore, Hardwood class timber Teak has been used for all test carried out. Ultimate limit compressive stress <b>grain</b> parallel <b>Finger</b> jointed timber variation was obtained between 24. 17 MPa - 36. 09 MPa. At the same time the serviceability limit compressive stress grain perpendicular value variation was between 22. 02 MPa - 26. 15 MPa. Here the highest value was obtained for the finger length of value 14 mm. Similarly, the Ultimate limit compressive stress of Grain perpendicular varies between 5. 69 MPa - 9. 6 MPa and the serviceability limit compressive stress of grin perpendicular varies in between 1. 91 Mpa- 5. 59 MPa.

However, scientific information available with regards to improving soil phosphorus supply and identification of P efficient varieties for the crops potential yield is limited. In order to investigate the effects of P levels on yield components and grain yield On-station field experiments were conducted in two sites of western Kenya during the long and short rain seasons of 2015. The experiment was laid out in a Randomized Complete Block Design in factorial arrangement with four levels of P (0, 12. 5, 25 and 37. 5 kg P 2 O 5 ha- 1 and three finger millet varieties (U- 15, P- 224 and a local check-Ikhulule) and the treatments replicated three times.

Experiments were conducted to evaluate the impacts of landscape position and field type on the biomass yield, N accumulation and N 2 -fixation by six legumes (cowpea, green gram, groundnut, mucuna, pigeonpea and soyabean) established with and without P during the short rain season of 2005. Residual effects of the legumes on the productivity of finger millet were assessed for two subsequent seasons in 2006 in two villages in Pallisa district, eastern Uganda. Legume biomass and N accumulation differed significantly (P < 0. 001) between villages, landscape position, field type and P application rate. Mucuna accumulated the most biomass (4. 8 – 10. 9 Mg ha- 1) and groundnut the least (1. 0 – 3. 4 Mg ha- 1) on both good and poor fields in the upper and middle landscape positions. N accumulation and amounts of N 2 -fixed by the legumes followed a similar trend as biomass, and was increased significantly by application of P. <b>Grain</b> yields of <b>finger</b> millet were significantly (P < 0. 001) higher in the first season after incorporation of legume biomass than in the second season after incorporation. Finger millet also produced significantly more grain in good fields (0. 62 – 2. 15 Mg ha- 1) compared with poor fields (0. 29 – 1. 49 Mg ha- 1) across the two villages. Participatory evaluation of options showed that farmers preferred growing groundnut and {{were not interested in}} growing pigeonpea and mucuna.

40|$|Uniformity {{is one of}} {{the issues}} of most {{critical}} concern for laser electrophotographic (EP) printers. Typical non-uniformity defects include mottle, <b>grain,</b> pinholes, and <b>finger</b> prints. Among these defects, mottle (low spatial frequency) and grain (high spatial frequency) are the most commonly observed. In order to assess Print Quality (PQ), we propose a novel method that uses a block-based technique to analyze the test page both visually and metrically. With a print-to-scan method, we use a grid of 150 pixels x 150 pixels (1 / 4 inch x 1 / 4 inch scanned at 600 dpi) square blocks throughout the scanned page. For each block, we examine two aspects: behavior of its pixels within the block (metric of graininess) and behavior of the blocks within the printed page (metric of uniformity). For an input scanned page, we create eight visual outputs, each displaying a different aspect of uniformity by using various pseudo color codings. ^ We next introduce a set of tools for machine learning in the assessment of printed page uniformity. This work is primarily targeted to the printing industry, specifically the ubiquitous laser, electrophotographic printer. We use selected features that are well-correlated with the rankings of expert observers to develop a novel machine learning framework that allows one to achieve the minimum 2 ̆ 2 false alarm 2 ̆ 2 rate, subject to a chosen 2 ̆ 2 miss 2 ̆ 2 rate. The features are collected from the previous eight models. A 2 ̆ 2 miss 2 ̆ 2 is defined to be a page that is not of acceptable quality to an expert observer that the prediction algorithm declares to be a 2 ̆ 2 pass 2 ̆ 2. Misses are a serious problem, since they represent problems that will not be seen by the systems designers. On the other hand, 2 ̆ 2 false alarms 2 ̆ 2 correspond to pages that an expert observer would declare to be of acceptable quality, but which are flagged by the prediction algorithm as 2 ̆ 2 fails 2 ̆ 2. In a typical printer testing and development scenario, such pages would be examined by an expert, and found to be of acceptable quality after all. 2 ̆ 2 False alarm 2 ̆ 2 pages result in extra pages to be examined by expert observers, which increases labor cost. But 2 ̆ 2 false alarms 2 ̆ 2 are not nearly as catastrophic as 2 ̆ 2 misses 2 ̆ 2, which represent potentially serious problems that are never seen by the systems developers. This scenario motivates us to develop a machine learning framework that will achieve the minimum 2 ̆ 2 false alarm 2 ̆ 2 rate subject to a specified 2 ̆ 2 miss 2 ̆ 2 rate. In order to construct such a set of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, we conduct an exhaustive search over the space of the nonlinear discriminants of the Cost-Sentitive Support Vector Machine (SVM) framework. Our work shows promise for applying a standard framework to obtain a full ROC curve when it comes to tackling other machine learning problems. ...|$|R

As Africa strives {{to close the gap}} between population and food production, sorghum and millet will become of increasing importance. This will be especially so where weather patterns are unpredictable because maize is much less adaptable to inadequate erratic rainfall. There are two broad categories of sorghum; red or brown sorghums, which often contain bitter tasting tannins in the seed coat, and white sorghums, which do not. The tannins deter predators but must be removed in order to make grain acceptable for human consumption. Sorghum is both drought-resistant and able to tolerate waterlogging better than maize because of its deep and well-branched root system. It is also remarkably pest-resistant, but unfortunately the compounds that help protect the crop from birds and insects make the grain and the stover less palatable and less digestible for people and livestock. Search for new varieties There are also two major types of millet; finger millet and bulrush millet. They are very different in appearance. The <b>grain</b> of <b>finger</b> millet is contained in a 'hand' of digits (hence the name) and the plant seldom grows higher than 1. 3 metres. Bulrush millet can grow to 3 metres. Millets are even more drought resistant than sorghum and can give good yields on infertile, sandy soil which would be unsuitable for most cereals. But millets are very susceptible to bird damage and, as more children attend school and are not available to scare birds, this can cause considerable losses. Farmers are also inclined to switch to maize, as has happened in Kenya and Tanzania, because millets and sorghum demand a great deal more work to harvest, store and process. The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) based in Hyderabad, India, has collected the seeds of over 22, 500 varieties of sorghum and 15, 500 varieties of millet. During the past decade, expeditions to India, northern Nigeria, southern Sudan, Malawi and Sierra Leone collected many sorghums and millets, including some wild ones. From this seed-bank of genetic diversity {{it should be possible to}} breed more new varieties with higher yields and even great resistance to drought. ICRISAT also has operations in Africa in Burkina Faso, Kenya, Malawi, Mali, Niger and Zimbabwe. The two main bases in Africa are the ICRISAT Sahelian Centre (ISC) near Niamey, Niger, and the SADCC/ICRISAT sorghum and millets improvement programme at Matapos, near Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. Inter-African research collaboration is also assisted through the Semi-Arid Foodgrains Research and Development (SAFGRAD) of the Organization of African Unity, which is based in Ougadougou, Burkina Faso. Improved processing and new uses Sorghum and millet are very similar to maize in their nutritional value. Traditionally both grains are prepared by pounding to remove the husks but, millet and sorghum flour does not keep well and fresh flour has to be prepared regularly. New techniques for easier processing are urgently needed and there have been some promising developments in mechanical decortication. A dry abrasive technique for milling of the husk off sorghum was developed from a Canadian design and promoted by the International Development Research Centre (IDRC). About 40 machines were made locally and installed in Botswana, and trials and demonstrations set up in several other SADCC countries. These decorticators proved well-suited to small-scale operations, as the cost of equipment is low. The cost of transportation of grain and products to and from the mill is minimized, employment is created in rural areas and, when milling a reasonably pure strain of white sorghum, a high yield of excellent quality product can be obtained. However, it is more difficult to process mixed crops to acceptable levels of colour and taste. An alternative technique for semi-wet milling of sorghum has been developed by the UK Natural Resources Institute (NRI). The whole sorghum grain is wetted with up to 25 % water and after 12 hours the conditioned grain is milled in a roller mill in the same way as maize or wheat. Even in highly bird resistant varieties of red sorghum the endosperm is normally white, and using this technique the white endosperm is effectively separated, leaving the bran and most of the coloured layers clean and almost intact. Semi-wet milling is not the answer for all situations, however, since it is unlikely that the process will be economically viable at a throughput of less than two tonnes per hour. Also, the meal produced has over 20 % moisture and is unsuitable for long-term storage. If techniques can be perfected to make sustainable use of much larger quantities of millet and sorghum (particularly red sorghum), which can be grown on the extensive and still under-utilized semi-arid lands of Africa, the consequences will be profound and far reaching: on food security, on rural employment and on agricultural income in many parts of the continent. Sorghum and millet were the indigenous staple foods of much of Africa before maize became popular, after its introduction by the Portuguese in the 17 th century. They remain the staples of thirteen African countries with a total population of some [...] ...|$|R

Poor soil fertility in smallholder farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa is recognised {{as a major}} factor responsible for low per capita food production and escalating food insecurity. Increasing food production in most smallholder farming systems requires intensification with nutrient inputs. Targeting nutrient management interventions to heterogeneity can greatly enhance the use efficiency of the scarce nutrient inputs and can help in identification of ‘best fits’ (most suitable options for niches within the systems). This thesis aimed at contributing to understanding how to target nutrient management options to heterogeneity for improved crop production in the Teso farming system in eastern Uganda. Land use change analysis between 1960 and 2001 showed that 48 - 78 % more land was brought into cultivation and disappearance of communal grazing lands. Productivity of the farming system is also low. Population growth, political-instability-mediated collapse of institutions that supported production and marketing of cotton, and cattle rustling account for the changes in land use and productivity of the system. Balances of N, P and K were positive on larger farms (LF) and negative on the medium farms (MF), small farms with cattle (SF 1) and without cattle (SF 2), but were negative at the crop scale on all the farm types. Livestock, crop yield, labour availability and access to off farm income are the sustainability indicators in the system. There were no topographic-gradients in soil pH, SOC, total N, Exch. Mg, Exch. Ca, Exch. K, CEC, sand and clay in the two villages with different geo-morphological features characterised except for extractable P which was 3 - 5 times higher {{in the in the}} top soils of the profiles in the valley bottoms than those in the upper landscape position of the toposequences. Soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations significantly differed (P< 0. 05) in surface soil properties between landscape positions and even significantly much larger (P< 0. 001) between field types. Fields classified as of good, medium and poor soil fertility by farmers had average SOC concentrations of respectively 9. 3 - 15 g kg– 1, 6. 6 - 11 g kg– 1, 5. 5 - 7. 0 g kg– 1. In contrast with other studies in smallholder farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa, spatial analysis did not reveal a particular generalized pattern in variability in soil fertility across farms. Within-farms, larger contents of SOC were associated with larger amounts of silt + clay and on locations of former kraals. The field scale, which is easily recognised by farmers, is an important entry point for targeting soil fertility management technologies. Heterogeneity in soil fertility affected performance of legumes established with and without P and their residual effect on subsequent finger millet crops. Legume biomass and N accumulation differed significantly (P< 0. 001) between villages, landscape position, field type and P application rate. Mucuna accumulated the most biomass (4. 8 - 10. 9 Mg ha– 1) and groundnut the least (1. 0 - 3. 4 Mg ha– 1) on both good and poor fields in the upper and middle landscape positions. N accumulation and amounts of N 2 -fixed by the legumes followed a similar trend as biomass, and was increased significantly by application of P. <b>Grain</b> yields of <b>finger</b> millet were significantly (P< 0. 001) higher in the first season after incorporation of legume biomass than in the second season after incorporation. Finger millet also produced significantly more grain yield in good fields (0. 62 - 2. 15 Mg ha– 1) compared with poor fields (0. 29 - 1. 49 Mg ha– 1). Farmers preferred growing groundnut and were not interested in growing pigeonpea and mucuna. They preferentially targeted grain legumes to good fields except for mucuna and pigeonpea to poor fields. Benefit-cost ratios indicated that legume-millet rotations without P application were only profitable on good fields. Green grams, cowpea and soyabean without P can be targeted to good fields on both upper and middle landscape positions in both villages but mucuna without P to poor fields on the middle landscape position in Chelekura village and cowpea without P to poor fields on the upper landscape position in Onamudian village. Application of N, P fertilisers alone (0, 30, 60, 90 kg ha– 1), N+P at equal rates of single application, and manure (3 t ha– 1) supplemented with N (0, 30, 60 and 90 kg ha– 1) to degraded fields closed the within farm yield gap in finger millet by only 24 %- 43 %. The inability of the options to close the yield differences was because of poor nutrient use efficiencies (< 25 %) and other nutrient limitations (S and K) and physical limitations due to surface crusting. With large heterogeneity in soil fertility within smallholder farming systems, blanket recommendations are of limited value. Using the Quantitative Evaluation of Fertility of Tropical Soils (QUEFTS) model calibrated for finger millet, balanced fertiliser requirements for a target millet yield of 2000 kg ha– 1 was estimated at 83 kg N ha– 1 and 52 kg P ha– 1 and 56 kg K ha– 1 for the sandy loam soils of Chelekura village and 64 kg N ha– 1 and 31 kg P ha– 1 and 40 kg K ha– 1 for the sandy clay loam soils in Onamudian village. Targeting nutrient management options can result in larger benefits from nutrient management interventions and specific attention can be afforded to specific constraints to avoid wastage of resources. Combining organic resources and mineral fertilisers is needed for higher crop yields and nutrient use efficiencies. However, the SOC thresholds for higher mineral fertiliser use efficiencies need to be determined for different soil types (silt + clay) and crops as well as making farm/ system scale reconfigurations of cropping systems that will enhance efficiency in resource use. Supportive policy frameworks should be put in place to enhance investment in soil fertility management and thus increase food production...|$|R
