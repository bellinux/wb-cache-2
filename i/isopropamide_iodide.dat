40|$|AbstractTwo sensitive, {{selective}} {{and precise}} stability indicating methods for {{the determination of}} <b>isopropamide</b> <b>iodide</b> (ISO), trifluoperazine hydrochloride (TPZ) and trifluoperazine oxidative degradate (DEG) were developed and validated. Method A is a successive derivative ratio spectrophotometric one, which depends on the successive derivative of ratio spectra in two steps using 0. 1 N HCl as a solvent and measuring TPZ at 250. 4 and 257. 2 nm, ISO at 223 and 228 nm and DEG at 210. 6, 213 and 270. 2 nm. Method B is mean centering of ratio spectra which depends on using the mean centered ratio spectra in two successive steps and measuring the mean centered values of the second ratio spectra at 322, 355 and 339 nm for TPZ, ISO and DEG, respectively. Factors affecting the developed methods were studied and optimized, moreover, they have been validated as per ICH guidelines and the results demonstrated that the suggested methods are reliable, reproducible and suitable for routine use with short analysis time. Statistical analysis of the two developed methods with the reported one using F- and Studentâ€™s t-test showed no significant difference regarding accuracy and precision...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a rapid and efficient Capillary Zone Electrophoresis (CZE) method for Quality Control analysis of pharmaceutical preparations containing antihistamines, decongestants, anticholinergic remedies and preservatives. Active ingredients of interest are: ChlorPheniramine Maleate (CPM), DiPhenhydramine Hydrochloride (DPH), Ephedrine hydrochloride (E), <b>Isopropamide</b> <b>Iodide</b> (II), Pheniramine Maleate (PM), Lidocaine hydrochloride (L), Tetracaine hydrochloride (T), Clopamide Hydrochloride (CH), DiHydroErgochristine (DHE), PhenylEphrine hy drochloride (PE) and Acetaminophen (A). Preservatives studied are: MethylParaben (MeP), EthylParaben (EtP), Pro pylParaben (PrP), ButylParaben (BuP), p -HydroxyBenzoic Acid (p- HBA). All these analytes were separated in a single run using 60 mM tetraborate buffer solution (TBS) pH = 9. 2 as a BackGround Electrolyte (BGE) by using an uncoated fused silica capillary of I. D. = 50 m m and applying a voltage of 25 kV {{in the first part of}} the electropheretic run (up to 5. 8 min) and 30 kV for the remaining time. The hydrodynamic pressurization of the inlet vial was 20 psi at 7. 2 min. up to the end of analysis. Total separation time was of 7. 5 min. The method was then successfully validated and applied to the simultaneous determination of active ingredients and preservatives. Good repeatability, linearity, and sensitivity were demonstrated. Precision of migration time (t m) was RSD% c) was RSD% 2 1. 000. LOD and LOQ, accuracy (recovery) and ruggedness were evaluated for each analyte demonstrating the good reliability of the method. Analyses of some pharmaceutical real samples were performed. </p...|$|E
