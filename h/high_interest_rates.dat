5|$|Another {{traditionally}} respected {{group which}} Joehana criticizes is the hajjis, those Muslims {{who have been}} on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. The hajjis in Joehana's stories are generally greedy and lustful, without any interest in the good of humanity. In Tjarios Agan Permas, for instance, Hajji Serbanna displays his hypocrisy by damning usury as haraam (sinful) while charging <b>high</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> for a loan, and refuses to complete the mandatory prayers because he is waiting on a guest bearing large gifts. The hajji is portrayed as wearing so much make-up that, in the opinion of Kartini et al., it is as if he is deliberately dressing as a clown.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the rise in prices – 14% in the twelve months to September 2008, compared with a target of 2.5% – the Central Bank of Iceland held interest rates high (15.5%). Such <b>high</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> compared with 5.5% in the United Kingdom or 4% in the eurozone for example, encouraged overseas investors to hold deposits in Icelandic krónur, leading to monetary inflation: the Icelandic money supply (M3) grew 56.5% in the twelve months to September 2008, compared with 5.0% GDP growth. The situation was effectively an economic bubble, with investors overestimating the true value of the króna.|$|E

25|$|However, the homesteading effort {{under the}} American regime {{resulted}} in a drop in tenancy in 1918, it ultimately failed in succeeding decades. This was due to two major factors. First, the new farmer-settlers {{did not have enough}} capital to sustain farming costs. Without any financial assistance available from the government that granted them the land, farmer-settlers accumulated huge debts at very <b>high</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> from usurious moneylenders.

25|$|The OPEC {{oil embargo}} marked a {{long-term}} economic transition since, {{for the first}} time, energy prices skyrocketed, and American factories faced serious competition from foreign automobiles, clothing, electronics, and consumer goods. By the late 1970s the economy suffered an energy crisis, slow economic growth, high unemployment, and very high inflation coupled with <b>high</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> (the term stagflation was coined). Since economists agreed on the wisdom of deregulation, many of the New Deal era regulations were ended, such as in transportation, banking, and telecommunications.|$|E

25|$|Reswitching {{implies the}} {{possibility}} of capital reversing, an association between <b>high</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> (or rates of profit) and more capital-intensive techniques. Thus, reswitching implies the rejection of a simple (monotonic) non-increasing relationship between capital intensity and either the rate of profit, sometimes confusingly {{referred to as the}} rate of interest. As rates fall, for example, profit-seeking businesses can switch from using one set of techniques (A) to another (B) and then back to A.

25|$|Several factors {{combine to}} put credit unions {{at risk of}} failure.
