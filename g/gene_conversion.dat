5|$|The Holliday {{junctions}} in {{homologous recombination}} are between identical or nearly identical sequences, {{leading to a}} symmetric arrangement of sequences around the central junction. This allows a branch migration process to occur where the strands move through the junction point. Cleavage, or resolution, of the Holliday junction can occur in two ways. Cleavage of the original set of strands leads to two molecules that may show <b>gene</b> <b>conversion</b> but not chromosomal crossover, while cleavage of the other set of two strands causes the resulting recombinant molecules to show crossover. All products, regardless of cleavage, are heteroduplexes {{in the region of}} Holliday junction migration.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} Holliday model for homologous recombination, single-strand breaks {{occur at the}} same point on one strand of each parental DNA. Free ends of each broken strand then migrate across to the other DNA helix. There, the invading strands are joined to the free ends they encounter, resulting in the Holliday junction. As each crossover strand reanneals to its original partner strand, it displaces {{the original}} complementary strand ahead of it. This causes the Holliday junction to migrate, creating the heteroduplex segments. Depending on which strand was used as a template to repair the other, the four cells resulting from meiosis might end up with three copies of one allele and only one of the other, instead of the normal two of each, a property known as <b>gene</b> <b>conversion.</b>|$|E
40|$|Siglecs are cell surface {{proteins}} {{that belong to}} the immunoglobulin superfamily and which bind sialic acids. They are composed of two groups, the conserved Siglecs and the CD 33 -related Siglecs. Previous studies have reported the occurrence of <b>gene</b> <b>conversions</b> between human CD 33 -related Siglecs and suggested that these conversions are adaptive because they increase the diversity of these immunoglobulin-related genes. Here, we analyze the Siglec genes of five primate species and show that <b>gene</b> <b>conversions</b> are not observed between conserved Siglec genes but that they are frequent between primate CD 33 -related Siglecs.

25|$|Genes are {{commonly}} {{regarded as the}} basic units transferred through an HGT event. However {{it is also possible}} for HGT to occur within genes. For example, {{it has been shown that}} horizontal transfer between closely related species results in more exchange of ORF fragments, a type a transfer called <b>gene</b> <b>conversion,</b> mediated by homologous recombination. The analysis of a group of four Escherichia coli and two Shigella flexneri strains revealed that the sequence stretches common to all six strains contain polymorphic sites, consequences of homologous recombination. Clusters of excess of polymorphic sites can thus be used to detect tracks of DNA recombined with a distant relative. This method of detection is, however, restricted to the sites in common to all analysed sequences, limiting the analysis to a group of closely related organisms.|$|E
25|$|Finding a {{cure for}} the {{diseases}} caused by frameshift mutations is rare. Research into this is evident. One example is a primary immunodeficiency (PID), an inherited condition {{which can lead to}} an increase in infections. There are 120 genes and 150 mutations that play a role in primary immunodeficiencies. The standard treatment is currently gene therapy, but this is a highly risky treatment and can often lead to other diseases, such as leukemia. Gene therapy procedures include modifying the zinc fringer nuclease fustion protein, cleaving both ends of the mutation, which in turn removes it from the sequence. Antisense-oligonucleotide mediated exon skipping is another possibility for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This process allows for passing over the mutation so {{that the rest of the}} sequence remains in frame and the function of the protein stays intact. This, however, does not cure the disease, just treats symptoms, and is only practical in structural proteins or other repetitive genes. A third form of repair is revertant mosaicism, which is naturally occurring by creating a reverse mutation or a mutation at a second site that corrects the reading frame. This reversion may happen by intragenic recombination, mitotic <b>gene</b> <b>conversion,</b> second site DNA slipping or site-specific reversion. This is possible in several diseases, such as X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome, and Bloom syndrome.

40|$|AbstractWe {{characterized}} the <b>gene</b> <b>conversions</b> between the human folate receptor (FOLR) genes {{and those of}} five other primate species. We found 26 <b>gene</b> <b>conversions</b> having an average length of 534 nucleotides. The length of these conversions is correlated with sequence similarity, converted regions have a higher GC-content and the average size of converted regions from a functional donor to another functional donor is significantly smaller than the average size from a functional donor to a pseudogene. Furthermore, the few conversions observed in the FOLR 1 and FOLR 2 genes did not change any amino acids in their coding regions and did not affect their promoter regions. In contrast, the promoter and coding regions of the FOLR 3 gene are frequently converted and these conversions changed many amino acids in marmoset. These results suggest that purifying selection is limiting the functional impact that frequent <b>gene</b> <b>conversions</b> have on functional folate receptor genes...|$|R

Such a problem is typically difficult to learn and classify and is quite common, especially among biological problems such as the identification of <b>gene</b> <b>conversions.</b> A multitude of solutions for this problem exist with varying levels of success. In this paper we present our solution, which involves using the MetaCost algorithm, a cost-sensitive “meta-classifier ” that requires a cost matrix to adjust the learning of an underlying classifier.

Here, we show that ectopic <b>gene</b> <b>conversions</b> are equally frequent in the backbone genes of pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains, {{that most of these}} conversions are short, and that the nucleotide changes they generate are probably selectively neutral.

In this study, the effects of these mutations were further analyzed by quantitation of mitotic homeologous recombinants as crossovers, <b>gene</b> <b>conversions</b> or exceptional events in wild-type, msh 2, msh 3 and msh 2 msh 3 mutant strains. When homeologous sequences were present as a direct repeat in one orientation, crossovers and <b>gene</b> <b>conversions</b> were elevated in msh 2, msh 3 and msh 2 msh 3 strains.

40|$|Most {{cases of}} {{congenital}} adrenal hyperplasia, the inherited inability to synthesize cortisol, {{are caused by}} mutations in the steroid 21 -hydroxylase gene (CYP 21). Steroid 21 -hydroxylase deficiency is unusual among genetic diseases in that approximately 95 % of the mutant alleles have apparently been generated by recombination between a normally active gene (CYP 21) and a linked pseudogene (CYP 21 P). Approximately 20 % of mutant alleles carry DNA deletions of 30 kb that have presumably been generated by unequal meiotic crossing-over, whereas 75 % carry one or more mutations in CYP 21 that are normally found in the CYP 21 P pseudogene. These latter mutations are termed "gene conversions," although the mechanism by which they are generated is not well understood. To assess the frequency at which these different recombination events occur, we have used PCR to detect de novo deletions and <b>gene</b> <b>conversions</b> in matched sperm and peripheral blood leukocyte DNA samples from normal individuals. Deletions with breakpoints in a 100 -bp region in intron 2 and exon 3 were detected in sperm DNA samples with frequencies of approximately 1 in 10 (5) - 10 (6) genomes but were never detected in the matching leukocyte DNA. <b>Gene</b> <b>conversions</b> in the same region occur in approximately 1 in 10 (3) - 10 (5) genomes in both sperm and leukocyte DNA.

We have analyzed the relationship between homologous recombination and crossing-over in haploid budding yeast and identified factors involved in the regulation of crossover outcomes. <b>Gene</b> <b>conversions</b> unaccompanied by a crossover appear 30 min before conversions accompanied by exchange, indicating that there are two different repair mechanisms in mitotic cells. Crossovers are rare (5 %), but deleting the BLM/WRN homolog, SGS 1, or the SRS 2 helicase increases crossovers 2 - to 3 -fold. Overexpressing SRS 2 nearly eliminates crossovers, whereas overexpression of RAD 51 in srs 2 Δ cells almost completely eliminates the noncrossover recombination pathway. We suggest Sgs 1 and its associated topoisomerase Top 3 remove double Holliday junction intermediates from a crossover-producing repair pathway, thereby reducing crossovers.

5000|$|The {{effective}} homology {{between the}} interacting sequences makes the <b>gene</b> <b>conversion</b> event successful. Additionally, {{the frequency of}} <b>gene</b> <b>conversion</b> is inversely proportional to {{the distance between the}} interacting sequences in cis (Schildkraut et al., 2005), [...] and the rate of <b>gene</b> <b>conversion</b> is usually directly proportional to the length of uninterrupted sequence tract in the assumed converted region. It seems that conversion tracts accompanying crossover are longer (mean length = ∼460 bp) than conversion tracts without crossover (mean length = 55-290 bp). In the studies of human globulin genes, it has long been supported that the <b>gene</b> <b>conversion</b> event or branch migration events can either be promoted or inhibited by the specific motifs that exist {{in the vicinity of the}} DNA sequence (Papadakis and Patrinos, 1999). Another basic classification of <b>gene</b> <b>conversion</b> events is the interlocus (also called nonallelic) and interallelic gene conversions. The cis or trans nonallelic or interlocus <b>gene</b> <b>conversion</b> events occur between nonallelic gene copies residing on sister chromatids or homologous chromosomes, and, in case of interallelic, the <b>gene</b> <b>conversion</b> events take place between alleles residing on homologous chromosomes (Adapted from Chen et al., (2007). If the interlocus <b>gene</b> <b>conversion</b> events are compared, it will be frequently revealed that they exhibit biased directionality. Sometimes, such as in case of human globin genes (Papadakis and Patrinos, 1999), the <b>gene</b> <b>conversion</b> direction correlates with the relative expression levels of the genes that participate in the event, with the gene expressed at higher level, called the ‘master’ gene, converting that with lower expression, called the ‘slave’ gene. Originally formulated in an evolutionary context, the ‘master/slave gene’ rule should be explained with caution. In fact, the increase in gene transcription exhibits not only the increase in likelihood of it to be used as a donor but also as an acceptor (Schildkraut et al., 2006).|$|E
40|$|The {{instability}} of simple tandem repeats, such as human minisatellite loci, {{has been suggested}} to arise by <b>gene</b> <b>conversions.</b> In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a double-strand break (DSB) {{was created by the}} HO endonuclease so that DNA polymerases associated with gap repair must traverse an artificial minisatellite of perfect 36 -bp repeats or a yeast Y' minisatellite containing diverged 36 -bp repeats. <b>Gene</b> <b>conversions</b> are frequently accompanied by changes in repeat number when the template contains perfect repeats. When the ends of the DSB have nonhomologous tails of 47 and 70 nucleotides that must be removed before repair DNA synthesis can begin, 16 % of <b>gene</b> <b>conversions</b> had rearrangements, most of which were contractions, almost always in the recipient locus. When efficient removal of nonhomologous tails was prevented in rad 1 and msh 2 strains, repair was reduced 10 -fold, but among survivors there was a 10 -fold reduction in contractions. Half the remaining events were expansions. A similar decrease in the contraction rate was observed when the template was modified so that DSB ends were homologous to the template; and here, too, half of the remaining rearrangements were expansions. In this case, efficient repair does not require RAD 1 and MSH 2, consistent with our previous observations. In addition, without nonhomologous DSB ends, msh 2 and rad 1 mutations did not affect the frequency or the distribution of rearrangements. We conclude that the presence of nonhomologous ends alters the mechanism of DSB repair, likely through early recruitment of repair proteins including Msh 2 p and Rad 1 p, resulting in more frequent contractions of repeated sequences...|$|R

The ordinary segregation pattern of an allele pair (Aa) among the 4 products of meiosis is 2A:2a. Detection of infrequent <b>gene</b> <b>conversion</b> events (e.g. 3:1 or 1:3 segregation patterns during individual meioses) provides insight into the alternate pathways of recombination leading either to crossover or non-crossover chromosomes. <b>Gene</b> <b>conversion</b> events are thought to arise where the “A” and “a” alleles happen to be near the exact location of a molecular recombination event. Thus, it is possible to measure the frequency with which <b>gene</b> <b>conversion</b> events are associated with crossover or non-crossover of chromosomal regions adjacent to, but outside, the immediate conversion event. Numerous studies of <b>gene</b> <b>conversion</b> in various fungi (which are especially suited for such studies) have been carried out, and the findings of these studies have been reviewed by Whitehouse. [...] It is clear from this review that most <b>gene</b> <b>conversion</b> events are not associated with outside marker exchange. Thus, most <b>gene</b> <b>conversion</b> events in the several different fungi studied are associated with non-crossover of outside markers. Non-crossover <b>gene</b> <b>conversion</b> events are mainly produced by Synthesis Dependent Strand Annealing (SDSA). [...] This process involves limited informational exchange, but not physical exchange of DNA, between the two participating homologous chromosomes at the site of the conversion event, and little genetic variation is produced. Thus, explanations for the adaptive function of meiotic recombination that focus exclusively on the adaptive benefit of producing new genetic variation or physical exchange seem inadequate to explain the majority of recombination events during meiosis. However, the majority of meiotic recombination events can be explained by the proposal that they are an adaptation for repair of damage in the DNA that is to be passed on to gametes.|$|E

The mean selection coe¤cient is negative, and the variance is dependent on the environmental diversity. Some facts relating to the theory are reviewed. As well as nucleotide substitutions, illegitimate recombination events such as duplications, deletions and <b>gene</b> <b>conversions</b> leave indelible marks on molecular evolution. <b>Gene</b> duplication and <b>conversion</b> are sources of the evolution of new gene functions. Positive selection is necessary for the evolution of novel functions. However, many examples of current gene families suggest that both drift {{and selection}} are at work on their evolution...|$|R
