25|$|The Wankel engine has the {{advantages}} of compact design and low weight over {{the most commonly used}} internal combustion engine employing reciprocating pistons. These advantages have given rotary <b>engine</b> <b>applications</b> in a variety of vehicles and devices, including: automobiles, motorcycles, racing cars, aircraft, go-karts, jet skis, snowmobiles, chainsaws, and auxiliary power units. The point of power to weight has been reached of under one pound weight per horsepower output.|$|E
500|$|Because {{titanium}} alloys have {{high tensile strength}} to density ratio, high corrosion resistance, fatigue resistance, high crack resistance, and ability to withstand moderately high temperatures without creeping, they are used in aircraft, armor plating, naval ships, spacecraft, and missiles. For these applications, titanium is alloyed with aluminium, zirconium, nickel, vanadium, and other elements to manufacture a variety of components including critical structural parts, fire walls, landing gear, exhaust ducts (helicopters), and hydraulic systems. In fact, about two thirds of all titanium metal produced is used in aircraft engines and frames. The SR-71 [...] "Blackbird" [...] {{was one of the}} first aircraft frames where titanium was used, paving the way for much wider use in modern military and commercial aircraft. An estimated 59 metric tons (130,000 pounds) are used in the Boeing 777, 45 in the Boeing 747, 18 in the Boeing 737, 32 in the Airbus A340, 18 in the Airbus A330, and 12 in the Airbus A320. The Airbus A380 may use 77 metric tons, including about 11 tons in the engines. In <b>engine</b> <b>applications,</b> titanium is used for rotors, compressor blades, hydraulic system components, and nacelles. The titanium 6AL-4V alloy accounts for almost 50% of all alloys used in aircraft applications.|$|E

2500|$|LNG {{offers a}} unique {{advantage}} over CNG for more demanding high-horsepower applications {{by eliminating the}} need for a turbocharger. [...] Because LNG boils at approximately -160C, by using a simple heat exchanger a small amount of LNG can be converted to its gaseous form at extremely high pressure with the use of little or no mechanical energy. [...] A properly designed high-horsepower engine can leverage this extremely high pressure energy dense gaseous fuel source to create a higher energy density air-fuel mixture than can be efficiently created with a CNG powered engine. [...] The end result when compared to CNG engines is more overall efficiency in high-horsepower <b>engine</b> <b>applications</b> when high-pressure direct injection technology is used. [...] The Westport HDMI2 fuel system {{is an example of a}} high-pressure direct injection technology that does not require a turbocharger if teamed with appropriate LNG heat exchanger technology. [...] The Volvo Trucks 13-liter LNG engine is another example of a LNG engine leveraging advanced high pressure technology.|$|E
