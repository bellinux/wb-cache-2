25|$|In 1960, The Fantasticks {{was first}} {{produced}} off-Broadway. This intimate allegorical show would quietly run for over 40 {{years at the}} Sullivan Street Theatre in Greenwich Village, becoming by far the longest-running musical in history. Its authors produced other innovative works in the 1960s, such as Celebration and I Do! <b>I</b> <b>Do!,</b> <b>the</b> first two-character Broadway musical. The 1960s would see a number of blockbusters, like Fiddler on the Roof (1964; 3,242 performances), Hello, Dolly! (1964; 2,844 performances), Funny Girl (1964; 1,348 performances), and Man of La Mancha (1965; 2,328 performances), and some more risqué pieces like Cabaret, before ending {{with the emergence of}} the rock musical. Two men had considerable impact on musical theatre history beginning in this decade: Stephen Sondheim and Jerry Herman.|$|E

Donna is hurt and humiliated when he leaves her alone. Donna eventually confesses to Elle Robinson (Pippa Black) that Matt has left and Donna moves in with Elle, who later becomes her guardian. At the end of 2008, Donna's younger brother and sister, Simon (Mauricio Merino, Jr.) and Tegan (Chelsea Jones) {{were introduced to the}} show. Merino and Jones won three-month contracts with the show through a competition with Dolly magazine. It was announced that the siblings would be [...] "Donna's worst nightmare" [...] and they were described as being [...] "cheeky" [...] and [...] "pesky". Robbie said she was looking forward to the arrival of Donna's siblings and developing her character further with their introductions. She added [...] "The more storylines <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>the</b> more real my character becomes. Now, I can do things and relate to her and understand where she's coming from".|$|E

500|$|On February21,1985, Yankovic began {{recording}} the parodies for Dare to Be Stupid. The first parody recorded for {{the album was}} [...] "Yoda". [...] "Yoda" [...] was originally written by Yankovic during the initial run of the 1980 American film The Empire Strikes Back. After {{the success of the}} movie, Yankovic {{toyed with the idea of}} writing a song based on the break-out character, but was unable to find a suitable song to use as the base. Yankovic remembers, [...] "I was still in college at the time, and a friend of mine named Mike suggested that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> song to the tune of 'Lola'—which I couldn't believe that I hadn't thought of myself, since I was such a huge Kinks fan." [...] Yankovic wrote and recorded a version of the song, using only an accordion, on a four-track cassette Portastudio. This version of [...] "Yoda" [...] was a hit on the [...] "Dr. Demento Show", and even managed to hit, and hold onto, number one on the Funny Five countdown for several weeks. This early demo was later released on the sixth volume of Dr. Demento's Basement Tapes.|$|E
500|$|After dismissing Anthony Julius, a Mishcon de Reya lawyer, Mills stated {{she would}} {{represent}} {{herself in the}} upcoming divorce hearing, with help from her sister Fiona, David Rosen, a solicitor-advocate, and Michael Shilub, an American attorney. In leaked documents, Mills complained that McCartney was often drunk, smoked cannabis, stabbed her with a broken wine glass, pushed her over a table, and pushed her into a bathtub when she was pregnant. Referring to her part in the marriage, Mills {{said that she had}} been a full-time wife, mother, lover, confidante, business partner and psychologist to McCartney. McCartney's lawyers studied Mills's book: Life Balance: The Essential Keys to a Lifetime of Wellbeing (2006), as it contradicted many of her claims, such as when she praised McCartney for [...] "Bringing me breakfast in bed every morning, no matter how he feels, and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> dinner, so we've got that agreement. It's thoughtfulness". Mills's father reconciled with his daughter after meeting her and McCartney, when they introduced him to his granddaughter, Beatrice. After their separation, he said that it [...] "took guts to represent yourself at the High Court", and that he was proud of his daughter, even though he thought she would be [...] "torn to shreds" [...] by McCartney's lawyers.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics for {{the album}} were all written by Radke during his imprisonment. He has {{often called the}} album a breakup record, but with a band and not a girl. Radke said that, [...] "I would think all day, for days and days, [...] what people would want to hear. I would dissect my old album and read all the fan letters and the reasons why they loved my band and why they listened to it. And I wrote about that, but in {{different}} ways. I don’t know why these kids love the tragedies that I write about. I guess they can relate to it." [...] Also on the writing process, Radke said that his lyrics were much more evolved than his past works and that he felt this was a high-point for the post-hardcore genre, owing success to being incarcerated and writing lyrics for two years with no other musical influences. The title, The Drug in Me Is You, came from Radke's experiences concerning his previous self-destructive behavior, which Radke explained that, [...] "We named it that because ... It's me, looking in the mirror, saying, 'I am my own worst [...] <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> worst damage to myself — {{more than anybody else}} can to do me.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Portraying {{a variety}} of roles, from romantic heroes to the reluctantly oppressed, Ledger created a hodgepodge of {{characters}} that are deliberately unlike one another, stating [...] "I feel like I am wasting my time if I repeat myself".

[...] Ledger liked to wait between jobs so that he would start creatively hungry on new projects.

2500|$|Van Peebles {{turned down}} a large money offer from a record label that wanted him to perform his lyrics over samples of older recordings. Van Peebles said, [...] "That's not what <b>I</b> <b>do!</b> <b>The</b> {{structures}} of my songs are more complicated and subtle than jingles or nursery rhymes, with music which helps carry the story along.

[...] Van Peebles later received an offer from Capitol Records and told the label [...] "Here's the deal: Send money, and leave me alone. I'll send the tape. That's it. Just go away, and let the doorknob hit you where the good Lord split you." [...] Capitol gave Van Peebles complete artistic control over the recording as a result, and he was satisfied with the business deal, {{as well as the}} finished album.|$|E

2500|$|In 221, after Sun Quan {{received}} the nominal vassal title [...] "King of Wu" [...] (吳王) from the Wei emperor Cao Pi, he appointed Liu Ji as Grand Prefect of Agriculture (大農令). He threw a feast to celebrate with his subjects. During the feast, Yu Fan, an official under Sun Quan, showed disrespect towards his lord. When an enraged Sun Quan drew {{his sword and}} wanted to kill Yu Fan, Liu Ji stood up, grabbed Sun Quan and pleaded with him to spare Yu Fan. He told Sun Quan, [...] "If Your Majesty kills a good man when you're drunk, even if Yu Fan is in the wrong, who would understand the truth?

2500|$|The wider U.S. {{economy was}} soon {{hit by the}} effects of the Trent crisis. On December 16, the actions of the British cabinet reached New York: the stock {{exchange}} fell across the board, with government securities dropping by 2.5 per cent and the sterling exchange rising by two points, and an overall suspension seemed imminent. On December 20, Salmon P. Chase's broker refused to sell some of the secretary's holdings of railway stock because they were almost worthless, and informed him that the business community [...] "trust you will have allayed this excitement with England: one war at a time is enough". A run on New York banks followed the stock market troubles, with $17,000,000 being withdrawn in three weeks, and on December 30 the banks voted by 25-15 to suspend specie payments. Banks across the country soon followed them, with only those of Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky continuing to redeem in coin. This suspension left the Treasury unable to pay its suppliers, contractors or soldiers. Though the crisis was resolved soon afterwards, these difficulties were not: on January 10, Lincoln asked Quartermaster General Meigs [...] "General, what shall <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> <b>The</b> people are impatient; Chase has no money, and he tells me he can raise no more; the General of the Armies has typhoid fever. The bottom is out of the tub. What shall I do?" [...] The Treasury was eventually forced to issue fiat money in the form of [...] "greenbacks" [...] to meet its obligations.|$|E

Yu Fan immediately sat up as soon as Sun Quan walked away. Sun Quan was furious when he saw that and he drew his sword and wanted to kill Yu Fan. His subjects were all shocked and fearful.
