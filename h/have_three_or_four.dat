5|$|Dirac's second-order {{perturbation}} theory can involve virtual photons, transient intermediate {{states of the}} electromagnetic field; the static electric and magnetic interactions are mediated by such virtual photons. In such quantum field theories, the probability amplitude of observable events is calculated by summing over all possible intermediate steps, even ones that are unphysical; hence, virtual photons are not constrained to satisfy , and may have extra polarization states; depending on the gauge used, virtual photons may <b>have</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> polarization states, instead of the two states of real photons. Although these transient virtual photons can never be observed, they contribute measurably to the probabilities of observable events. Indeed, such second-order and higher-order perturbation calculations can give apparently infinite contributions to the sum. Such unphysical results are corrected for using the technique of renormalization.|$|E
5|$|M. hirsuta and M. inquilina are {{the only}} known species in this genus that are inquilines and live in other Myrmecia colonies. An M. inquilina queen {{has been found in}} an M. vindex colony. Myrmecia is a larval {{attendant}} to the butterfly Theclinesthes serpentata (saltbush blue), while some species, particularly M. nigrocincta, enslave other ant species, notably those in the genus Leptomyrmex. M. nigriceps ants are able to enter another colony of the same species without being attacked, as they may be unable to recognize alien conspecifics, nor do they try to distinguish nestmates from ants of another colony. Formicoxenus provancheri and M. brevinoda share a form of symbiotic relationship known as xenobiosis, where one species of ant will live with another and raise their young separately, with M. brevinoda being the host. Solenopsis may sometimes nest in Myrmecia colonies, as a single colony was found to <b>have</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> Solenopsis nests inside. Lagria beetles and rove beetles in the genus Heterothops dwell inside colonies and skinks and frogs have also been found living unmolested within Myrmecia nests. Metacrinia nichollsi, for example, has been reported living inside M. regularis colonies.|$|E
25|$|Mating {{occurs during}} flight {{in the fall}} (and {{occasionally}} winter), and although females may <b>have</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> embryos in the spring, typically only twins are born in late May or early June. If their maternity roost is disturbed, mother yellow bats will pick up their pups and carry them to a safer roost. Baby bats become volant (able to fly) between June and August, and will form evening feeding aggregations with adult females while adult males remain solitary.|$|E

25|$|The {{homes of}} local mpanjaka, called tranobe (big houses), {{are used as}} {{community}} meeting space {{as well as a}} temple for the worship of ancestors. These houses are unusually large by Malagasy standards, built in a rectangular form with no veranda, and are raised on low stilts and have a gabled roof covered in ravinala leaves. The floor is also typically made of ravenala, and the walls are constructed of braided falafa leaves. There are ten such tranobe in Mananjary and twelve in the historic village of Ambohitsara, but most Antambaohoaka villages <b>have</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four.</b>|$|E
25|$|Suit jackets in all styles {{typically}} <b>have</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> {{buttons on}} each cuff, {{which are often}} purely decorative (the sleeve is usually sewn closed and cannot be unbuttoned to open). Five buttons are unusual and are a modern fashion innovation. The number of buttons is primarily {{a function of the}} formality of the suit; a very casual summer sports jacket might traditionally (1930s) have had only one button, while tweed suits typically have three and city suits four. In the 1970s, two buttons were seen on some city suits. Today, four buttons are common on most business suits and even casual suits.|$|E

500|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Junkin played college {{football}} with the Duke Blue Devils. He played in three games for the Blue Devils as a freshman. In one game against North Carolina State, Junkin had 25 tackles {{en route to a}} 27â€“26 Duke victory; head coach Steve Sloan stated afterwards that it was [...] "one of the best games I have ever seen a freshman play." [...] Between his freshman and sophomore seasons, Junkin went from 205 pounds to 240 to help get more playing time. As a sophomore, he spent the 1984 season as one of five starting linebackers on a modified Duke defense, which normally would <b>have</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> linebackers. In his junior season, he was again a starting linebacker and finished the season with 162 tackles despite playing on an injured knee. Junkin started off his senior year with 15 tackles against Northwestern despite battling a head cold. Three weeks later in a game against Virginia, Junkin had 18 tackles and was named Atlantic Coast Conference defensive player of the week. Junkin graduated from Duke after the 1986 season as the school record-holder for career tackles with 512. Due to his performance his senior year, Junkin was named to the Second Team College Football All-American.|$|E
2500|$|A bandsaw (also written band saw) is a {{saw with}} a long, sharp blade {{consisting}} of a continuous band of toothed metal stretched between two or more wheels to cut material. They are used principally in woodworking, metalworking, and lumbering, but may cut a variety of materials. Advantages include uniform cutting action {{as a result of}} an evenly distributed tooth load, and the ability to cut irregular or curved shapes like a jigsaw. The minimum radius of a curve is determined by the width of the band and its kerf. [...] Most bandsaws have two wheels rotating in the same plane, one of which is powered, although some may <b>have</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> to distribute the load. The blade itself can come in a variety of sizes and tooth pitches (teeth per inch, or TPI), which enables the machine to be highly versatile and able to cut a wide variety of materials including wood, metal and plastic.|$|E
2500|$|More {{information}} about the game was released {{just prior to the}} E3 event in May. Two non-playable demo levels were shown, demonstrating the game engine's ability to create battles involving up to 170 soldiers, with advanced AI resulting in enemies and allies fighting one another irrespective of the player's actions. A new playable demo was made available at E3 itself, with Sega emphasizing that at any one time in battle, the player may <b>have</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> simultaneous objectives. A near complete build of the game was sent out to gaming websites in August. IGN's Juan Castro wrote [...] "while unfinished, Spartan: Total Warrior looks good and plays well [...] combat feels intense and moves at a fluid pace, running at a solid framerate throughout." [...] GameSpot's Justin Calvert was equally impressed, especially with the absence of in-game loading; [...] "there are absolutely no load times once the action gets under way--which is no small achievement, given the sheer scale of some of the environments." ...|$|E

2500|$|The dulcimer {{comes in}} various sizes, {{identified}} {{by the number of}} strings that cross each of the bridges. A 15/14, for example, has 15 strings crossing the treble bridge and 14 crossing the bass bridge, and can span three octaves. The strings of a hammered dulcimer are usually found in pairs, two strings for each note (though some instruments <b>have</b> <b>three</b> <b>or</b> <b>four</b> strings per note). Each set of strings is tuned in unison and is called a course. As with a piano, the purpose of using multiple strings per course is to make the instrument louder, although as the courses are rarely in perfect unison, a chorus effect usually results like a mandolin. A hammered dulcimer, like an autoharp, harp, or piano, requires a tuning wrench for tuning, since the dulcimer's strings are wound around tuning pins with square heads. (Ordinarily, 5mm [...] "zither pins" [...] are used, similar to, but smaller in diameter than piano tuning pins, which come in various sizes ranging upwards from [...] "1/0" [...] or 7mm.) ...|$|E
