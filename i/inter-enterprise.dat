Delegates (Bogdan Lis, Andrzej Gwiazda and others) together with shipyard strikers agreed to create an <b>Inter-Enterprise</b> Strike Committee (Międzyzakładowy Komitet Strajkowy, or MKS). On August 17 a priest, Henryk Jankowski, performed a mass outside the shipyard's gate, at which 21 demands of the MKS were put forward.

Among the leaders of this strike were Anna Walentynowicz and Lech Wałęsa, a long-fired shipyard electrician who headed the strike committee. A list of 21 demands was formulated by the <b>Inter-Enterprise</b> Strike Committee on 17 August. The strike wave spread along the coast, closing the ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With {{the assistance of the}} activists from the KOR, and the support of many intellectuals (an Expert Commission was established to aid with the negotiations), the workers occupying the various factories, mines and shipyards across Poland organized as a united front. They were not limiting their efforts to seeking economic improvements, but made and stuck to the crucial demand, an establishment of trade unions independent of government control. Among other issues raised were rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners and an improved health service.|$|E

By facilitating an opportunistic environment, it aims to consistently realise a scalable resource provisioning setting that handles sudden variation in user demands. Herein we propose an architectural strategy for scheduling jobs in <b>inter-enterprises</b> with a particular focus to inter-clouds. The scheduling concept is based on the meta-computing paradigm, with the purpose of establishing a wide and decentralized policy control among various resources and resource owners. To this extend, we start with presenting an analysis of the cloud characteristics and inter-cloud requirements. Following this, we present an identification of the most critical issues when developing the strategy based on the functional requirements analysis. This has {{led to the development of}} a strategic plan which provides the architecture for an interoperable, efficient and flexible environment to support the inter-cooperation between heterogeneous <b>inter-enterprises...</b>|$|R
25|$|When, in August 1980, Anna Walentynowicz {{lost her}} job at the Gdańsk Shipyard because of her {{position}} as editor of the underground newspaper Robotnik Wybrzeze, her fellow workers took action. Around 16,000 employees of the shipyard discontinued their work and occupied its premises on the morning of August 14, demanding Walentynowicz’s re-employment, the erection of a monument in honor of the victims of the strikes of 1970, and a pay rise of 2000 zlotys, amongst other things. After negotiating with management and having most of their demands met, a vote was taken on August 16 leading to the strike being called off. By this time, however, many of the workers at facilities surrounding the Gdańsk Shipyard had begun their own strikes making similar demands, and it was decided that in solidarity with them, the workers in the shipyard would continue to strike despite their own demands having been met. By the next morning the <b>Inter-Enterprise</b> Strike Committee (Polish shorthand: MKS) had been formed within the gates of the shipyard, intending to unite workers in the Gdańsk-Sopot-Gdynia area, coordinating action and maintaining and order {{to ensure the safety of}} the strikers. Lech Wałęsa, an electrician who had lost his job at the Gdańsk Shipyard in the strikes of 1976 was elected as chair of the MKS, while the remainder of the committee was composed of delegates from other facilities including Bogdan Lis, Andrzej Gwiazda, and others. By August 18, the MKS represented workers from 156 separate enterprises, and the number was steadily growing. Just two days after the formation of MKS the Polish economy was brought to a standstill as workers struck at factories and ports all along the Baltic coast. By August 21, much of the country was affected by strikes, even including the inland mines of the Upper Silesian Industrial Area, as more and more workers joined independent unions. The <b>Inter-Enterprise</b> Strike Committee at Gdańsk was becoming the national center for trade union movement: a phenomenon which was itself unique to this series of events. In the strikes of the 1950s and ‘70s it was the lack of a central organized structure that had limited the mobilization potential of striking workers. Now the MKS had been specifically designed with this problem in mind - the decentralization of the workers’ movement – and was working for the first time to unify and strengthen the movement, coordinating strikes all across Poland. It was for this reason that the government of Edward Gierek found they could no longer buy off strikers with small concessions, and finally had to settle into heavy negotiations with the MKS.|$|E

500|$|Gdańsk {{became the}} focal point of the strike movement. On 21 August 1980, Mieczysław Jagielski {{replaced}} Tadeusz Pyka to lead a Polish government commission which was negotiating with strikers there. The strikers were represented by the <b>Inter-Enterprise</b> Strike Committee, which was demanding that the workers it represented be given better rights, including better rights to strike. On 26 August meeting with representatives of the strikers at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk, Jagielski promised that the right to strike would be added to a new law on the official trade unions of Poland. After 5 more days of difficult negotiations, a settlement was reached between the strikers and the government, known as the Gdańsk agreement. Norman Davies contends that Jagielski [...] "in the end realised that only two alternatives remained -either agreement on the strikers' terms or an immediate resort to force for which the government was not prepared." [...] The agreement, as well as giving the workers of the Lenin Shipyard the right to strike, also allowed them to form their own independent trade union. Jagielski said of the negotiations that led to the agreement, [...] "We have spoken as Poles to Poles...There are no winners and losers. The important thing here is that we have understood each other and the best guarantee for what we have done is hard work." [...] He was reported to have spoken eloquently.|$|E

40|$|In {{a global}} {{business}} context with continuous changes, the enterprises have {{to enhance their}} operational efficiency, to react more quickly, to ensure the flexibility of their business processes, and to build new collaboration pathways with external partners. To achieve this goal, they must use e-business methods, mechanisms and techniques while capitalizing on the potential of new information and communication technologies. In this context, we propose a standards, model and Web services-based approach for modeling and integrating agile enterprise business processes. The purpose is to benefit from Web services characteristics to enhance the processes design and realize their dynamic integration. The choice of focusing on Web services is essentially justified by their broad adoption by enterprises {{as well as their}} capability to warranty interoperability between both intra and <b>inter-enterprises</b> systems. Thereby, we propose in this chapter a metamodel for describing business processes, and discuss their dynamic integration by addressing the Web services discovery issue. On the one hand, the proposed metamodel is in line with the W 3 C Web services standards, namely, WSDL, SAWSDL and WS-Policy. It considers the use of BPMN standard to describe the behavioral aspect of business processes and completes their design using UML diagrams describing their functional, non-functional and semantic aspects. On other hand, our approach for integrating processes is in line with BPEL standard recommended to orchestrate Web services. To realize executable business processes, this approach recommends the use of semantic matching and selection mechanisms in order to produce agile systems.

From data collected by comprehensive questionnaire survey in 2002 and mass interviews with 60 enterprises and assembling families and several government authorities in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2008, four types of networks are identified: spin-off, consulting, communication and cooperative. The characteristic of these networks is outlined in detail. Compared with the high-tech clusters of typical developed areas, the networks that have evolved in traditional manufacturing clusters are more affected by emotive linkages. The cluster networks are shown to exhibit a polycentric hierarchical structure. The family relationships are the dominate spin-off channels of enterprises, while the supply and demand relationships and the mobility of the skilled workers are also important paths of network learning, and the cooperation relationships are comparatively stable. Besides the root enterprises, the middle-sized enterprises are comparatively more active than small-sized enterprises, and the intermediary agencies and the service institutions act as bridges of the <b>inter-enterprises</b> cooperation. By analysis of the structure of networks and the interactions between the networks, the four stages of network evolution are also identified.
