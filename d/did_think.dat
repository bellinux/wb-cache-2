5|$|Between 9 and 10 pm on {{the night}} of April 18, 1775, Joseph Warren told Revere and William Dawes that the British troops were about to embark in boats from Boston bound for Cambridge and the road to Lexington and Concord. Warren's {{intelligence}} suggested that the most likely objectives of the regulars' movements later that night would be the capture of Adams and Hancock. They did not worry about the possibility of regulars marching to Concord, since the supplies at Concord were safe, but they <b>did</b> <b>think</b> their leaders in Lexington were unaware of the potential danger that night. Revere and Dawes were sent out to warn them and to alert colonial militias in nearby towns.|$|E
25|$|While Jung {{worked on}} his Wandlungen und Symbole der Libido (Psychology of the Unconscious), {{tensions}} became manifest between him and Freud because of their disagreements over the nature of libido and religion. Jung de-emphasized the importance of sexual development {{and focused on the}} collective unconscious: the part of the unconscious that contains memories and ideas that Jung believed were inherited from ancestors. While he <b>did</b> <b>think</b> that libido was an important source for personal growth, unlike Freud, Jung did not believe that libido alone was responsible for the formation of the core personality. Jung believed his personal development was influenced by factors he felt were unrelated to sexuality.|$|E

500|$|IGN's Travis Fickett {{said that}} Michael {{falling in love}} with the chair model was [...] "a hysterical turn and {{highlights}} just how deluded Michael – and Dwight – can be". Fickett was critical of the [...] "parking" [...] storyline, saying that it was [...] "a bit over the top and runs a bit thin", but he <b>did</b> <b>think</b> that the scene at the end with Kevin was [...] "a sweet and genuine moment". Aubry D'Arminio of Entertainment Weekly stated that, in relation to the previous episode [...] "Dinner Party", [...] "Last night's show took another approach. Don't get me wrong. It was a blinder—but a totally different animal, so to speak." [...] D'Arminio went on to praise the dual plots of the episode.|$|E
500|$|... "A Quiet Night In" [...] was {{submitted}} to the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), but was not nominated for a 2015 BAFTA award. In an interview with Digital Spy, Shearsmith said that this surprised him, saying [...] "I was upset, I <b>did</b> <b>think</b> {{it was a shame}} that it's not been recognised. You want people to have seen it and to have recognised the work, and innovation, but I think people are doing that. I get told that every day on Twitter, or in meetings." [...] A number of journalists expressed surprise that Inside No. 9 had received no BAFTA nominations, with Julia Raeside, of The Guardian, describing [...] "A Quiet Night In" [...] as [...] "one of the most inspired pieces of mute theatre I've seen on television".|$|E
500|$|Following {{the failure}} of two of her {{commercial}} releases, Zinta began working with art film directors, and turned towards neo-realistic films, known in India as Parallel Cinema. She acted in her first English film, Rituparno Ghosh's The Last Lear, as a struggling film actress opposite Amitabh Bachchan. The film premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival, and was received well. Later reviews in India were approving, with Rajeev Masand writing, [...] "Preity Zinta gets through her scenes competently, never allowing her cute-as-a-button image {{to take away from}} the impact she makes here as a conflicted, mature woman." [...] Initially dismissive of art films, Zinta eventually spoke of her first venture into the genre, confessing, [...] "I <b>did</b> <b>think</b> with art films that they don't pay you, they don't feed you, but I was wrong, and I'm so happy to be here." ...|$|E

500|$|In September 1996, Ben Rogers ate at the {{restaurant}} for The Independent before it had gained any Michelin stars or the awards it has today and {{while it was still}} using something close to its original menu. Even so, he discovered that Blumenthal was cooking foie gras in sherry in order to give it a nutty flavour, although Rogers wasn't sure if the nutty flavour was warranted in the dish itself. He <b>did</b> <b>think</b> that a jambonneau of duck was worth praising, describing it as [...] "delicious", but also thought that another dish of monkfish was rubbery in texture. He described the menu itself as [...] "awkwardly written, badly punctuated, and at points quite impenetrable". Following the first Michelin star, David Fingleton visited {{the restaurant}} for The Spectator, and said that the experience was [...] "beyond reproach; unsullied pleasure from start to finish".|$|E
500|$|Reservoir Dogs was, {{according}} to Tarantino, influenced by Stanley Kubrick's The Killing. Tarantino said: [...] "I didn't {{go out of}} my way to do a rip-off of The Killing, but I <b>did</b> <b>think</b> of it as my [...] "Killing," [...] my take on that kind of heist movie." [...] The film's plot was suggested by the 1952 film Kansas City Confidential. Additionally, Joseph H. Lewis's 1955 film The Big Combo and Sergio Corbucci's 1966 Spaghetti Western Django inspired the scene where a police officer is tortured in a chair. Tarantino has denied that he plagiarized with Reservoir Dogs and instead said that he does homages. Having the main characters named after colors (Mr. Pink, White, Brown, etc.) was first seen in the 1974 film The Taking of Pelham One Two Three. The film also contains key elements similar to those found in Ringo Lam's 1987 film City on Fire.|$|E
500|$|After {{his release}} from prison, Vick was mentored by former Indianapolis Colts coach Tony Dungy. The {{prospect}} of his return to professional football {{was the subject of}} much conjecture as his suspension and incarceration continued. In 2007, ESPN's John Clayton said few general managers were in a strong enough position to consider taking a chance on Vick, and even then most NFL owners would be concerned about a fan and media backlash. There was also no chance of Vick resurrecting his career in the Canadian Football League, he said. Following a furor in 2007 over Ricky Williams playing there while serving a suspension, the CFL banned players currently suspended by the NFL. In any case, Clayton said it would be nearly impossible for a convicted felon to get a Canadian work visa. He <b>did</b> <b>think,</b> however, that Vick would be [...] "unstoppable" [...] if he decided to play in the Arena Football League.|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched Star Trek: The Next Generation {{after the}} end of the series. Keith DeCandido watched the episode for Tor.com, and thought that Marta DuBois' {{performance}} was [...] "the only reason why this episode is in any way watchable. Barely". He thought that the episode felt more similar to an [...] story than a normal Next Generation story, and that was due to the episode's origins. He said [...] "overall, it’s just dumb" [...] and gave it a score of two out of ten. Zack Handlen thought more positively of the episode when he reviewed it for The A.V. Club. He <b>did</b> <b>think</b> that Captain Picard was pretending to be Captain Kirk for most of the episode and that it didn't have any real drama but that it was [...] "silly, goofy fun for the most part". He thought the episode was [...] "cute" [...] and gave it an overall score of B+.|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall, {{television}} {{writer for}} The Star-Ledger, said Michael acted so [...] "nakedly selfish and unfeeling" [...] {{that it made}} the episode unpleasant to watch: [...] "If last week's 'Blood Drive' gave us Michael at his most human and sympathetic, then 'Golden Ticket' showed how a human Michael {{could also be a}} monster." [...] However, Sepinwall said he <b>did</b> <b>think</b> the subplot involving Kevin receiving romantic advice was funny and sweet: [...] "Brian Baumgartner's just been aces the last two weeks, and if it hadn't been for this story, I might have found 'Golden Ticket' unbearable." [...] Dan Hopper of VH1's Best Week Ever strongly criticized the episode and the behavior of the characters: [...] "Why was every single character on last night’s Willy Wonka episode acting like a complete idiot? Not 'idiot' {{in the sense that the}} characters are always dumb and goofy in an amusing way, but 'idiot' as in 'none of these human beings would ever act this way and this is really frustrating to watch? ...|$|E
500|$|David Bianco, {{reviewing}} the early episodes {{of the series}} for USA Today, found the show's villains to be its weakest link, praising Stevens, Keller, and Smart, and saying that though it [...] "may initially seem confusing and frustrating... if any show deserves your patience, it’s Legion. Rewards await." [...] In his review on RogerEbert.com, Brian Tallerico praised the series for its focus on character, especially by having none of its characters [...] "defined by their powers or their relation to a villain". He felt that the performances of Stevens and Keller were especially strong, but <b>did</b> <b>think</b> that the series took itself too seriously at times, lacking some of the humor usually found {{in the works of}} Hawley and Marvel. David Wiegand for the San Francisco Chronicle called Legion the best series of the new year, and praised the [...] "resolutely novelistic" [...] approach from Hawley. Wiegand felt, [...] "It would be facile to say Legion is a comic book show for people who don’t like comic book shows. At the same time, it does have a far more complex thematic and psychological structure than most comic book shows." [...] He praised the cast, especially Stevens, who he said [...] "simply does the best work of his career".|$|E

500|$|Ivan had {{previously}} been married to a woman and he enjoys flirting with females. One such moment is a flirtation with Jasmine Thomas (Jenna-Louise Coleman); they bond over her liking of the Brontë novels Wuthering Heights and Shirley. When Nicola Blackstock (Nicola Wheeler) confesses her attraction to Ivan, he tells her that it is her brother, Paul that he is interested in and kisses him on the cheek. Brocklebank told Laws that he had known Bose for six years prior to joining the serial and was also living with him. He {{said that it would}} be [...] "embarrassing" [...] if romance developed between their characters because of their friendship. However, the actor <b>did</b> <b>think</b> it was [...] "great" [...] to be given [...] "such a meaty storyline". Brocklebank told a reporter from The People that he dreaded to think what his grandmother would make of the storyline. He said he was interested to receive the reaction from viewers because [...] "it's a subject that hasn't been covered before". The actor later said that he found Ivan's bisexuality [...] "really interesting" [...] because he felt that it had not [...] "really been tackled in soaps before". Brocklebank later spoke of his belief that there was [...] "still a stigma attached to being bisexual" [...] and his hopes that Ivan's storyline would [...] "break some barriers" [...] around the issue.|$|E
500|$|IGN's Terri Schwartz {{gave the}} episode a [...] "good" [...] 7.8 out of 10, calling the {{blackout}} plot [...] "fairly throwaway" [...] but a backdrop to [...] "tell {{far more interesting}} stories", with Luna's Reyes continuing to be the strongest new element of the season. Schwartz criticized the episode's killing and resurrection of May as [...] "one of the weaker storytelling tricks in an otherwise solid episode—and as expected, May came back and is just fine." [...] Writing for Nerdist, Joseph McCabe had mixed feelings about the episode's political angle {{and the use of}} Inhumans as a stand-in for minorities, but praised the chemistry between Coulson, Mack, and Fitz, and the further exploration of Jeffrey Mace. McCabe was highly critical of guest star Lorenzo James Henrie, calling him [...] "no more charismatic here than he was in Fear the Walking Dead, and his character is every bit as unsympathetic as his misguided rebel was on that show, wheelchair or no." [...] Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush was particularly negative, feeling the episodes' different storylines [...] "ended up feeling like three disparate stories with some notable reaching'. He felt the Inhuman prejudice storyline and attack by looters on Gabe were forced, and that the May storyline did not [...] "really [...] our idea of where the AI or ghostly threads will end up". Fitzpatrick <b>did</b> <b>think</b> that the introduction of Nagra would [...] "help Season 4 find its footing again" [...] with a more focused overarching story.|$|E
500|$|Staci Layne Wilson of Horror.com {{also felt}} {{the film was}} full of stereotypes, {{including}} a [...] "stupid circus trainer; bible-thumping naysayer; the great white hunter; small-minded mayor; pinheaded press; wise Indian sage; [...] military sorts" [...] but felt they were depicted in such an extreme manner that they were simply boring. She found the films conclusion to be predictable and [...] "corny". She did praise the film's cinematography and visual appeal despite {{the limited number of}} filming locations actually used. In reviewing the film for DVD Talk, film instructor and critic Justin Felix found the use of a real tiger one of the only original elements of the film, while feeling the plot, setting, and characters followed the set Sci Fi Channel movie of the week formula. At the same time, he notes that the use of a live tiger results in most attacks occurring off screen and the tiger being rarely seen at all, taking away the [...] "usual" [...] fun of laughing at badly done [...] "CG terrors." [...] Monsters and Critics.coms Jeff Swindoll felt the film was a poor attempt at replicating Jaws with the tiger taking on the role of a [...] "land shark." [...] While he felt the character of Colonel Graham was contrived and seemed to come from another era, Swindoll <b>did</b> <b>think</b> Ian D. Clark did portray the character decently. Like other critics, Swindoll praised the use of a live tiger, but also notes that it was obvious the tiger was playing with the actors like a [...] "sweet pussycat" [...] and that the post-production editing did a bad job of trying {{to make it look like}} the tiger was a vicious killer.|$|E
