5|$|The band {{arrived in}} Japan on 9 August, {{a week before}} the tour started, to a strong reception, and were greeted with gifts and flowers. Birch was not {{confident}} that the recording quality would be satisfactory, since the equipment supplied by Warner Bros. did not have any balance control and that the recorder's size did not appear big enough on sight to capture a commercial quality recording. The band were uninterested in the end result, concentrating on simply being able to deliver a <b>good</b> <b>show.</b> Lord later noticed however that he felt this attitude meant the spontaneity of the performances and interplay between the band members was captured well.|$|E

25|$|Sports Night is an American {{television}} series about a fictional sports news show also called Sports Night. It {{focuses on the}} friendships, pitfalls and ethical issues the creative talent of the program face while trying to produce a <b>good</b> <b>show</b> under constant network pressure. Created by Aaron Sorkin, the half-hour prime time comedy-drama aired on ABC for two seasons, from 1998 to 2000.|$|E

Little Britain was later broadcast on the BBC's terrestrial analogue channels BBC One and BBC Two. The channels longest-running comedy programme is Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps. Some current programmes feature stand-up comedians performing their own take on a subject, usually the news, examples of which include Russell Howard's Good News (Now being broadcast on BBC Two, due to success and partly to BBC Three's move to online only) and Lee Nelson's Well <b>Good</b> <b>Show.</b>|$|E

25|$|Hatton {{became very}} wealthy {{as a result}} of his {{progressing}} career and the Queen's fondness for him, so much so that in 1583 he embarked on the construction of a magnificent house in Holdenby, Northamptonshire. It was, at the time, the largest privately owned Elizabethan house in England. It contained 123 huge glass windows, in the days when glass was very expensive (indeed, a <b>good</b> <b>show</b> of wealth was how many windows you could afford in your house). It had two great courts and was as large as the palace of Hampton Court. It was three storeys high and had two large state rooms, one for himself and another for the queen should she ever come and stay, which she never did.|$|E
25|$|Coogan {{began his}} career as a comic and impressionist, {{performing}} regularly in Ipswich, before working as a voice artist for television advertisements and the satirical puppet show Spitting Image. His first experience in movies was as an extra in the Deerhunter starring Robert De Niro. In 1989, he appeared in a series of specially shot sketches in the Observation round in the long-running ITV game show The Krypton Factor. In 1992, Coogan won the Perrier Award at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe for his performance with long-time collaborator John Thomson, and starred alongside Caroline Aherne and John Thomson in a one-off Granada TV sketch show The Dead <b>Good</b> <b>Show.</b> His most prominent characters developed at this time were Paul Calf, a stereotypical working class Mancunian, and his sister Pauline, played by Coogan in drag.|$|E

Gladiators became big business for trainers and owners, for politicians on the make {{and those who had}} reached the top and wished to stay there. A politically ambitious privatus (private citizen) might postpone his deceased father's munus to the election season, when a generous show might drum up votes; those in power and those seeking it needed the support of the plebeians and their tribunes, whose votes might be won with the mere promise of exceptionally <b>good</b> <b>show.</b> Sulla, during his term as praetor, showed his usual acumen in breaking his own sumptuary laws to give the most lavish munus yet seen in Rome, on occasion of his wife's funeral.|$|E
25|$|Dravid {{compensated}} for the below par performance in tests in 2001–02 season with a <b>good</b> <b>show</b> in the ODIs. On the tour to Zimbabwe, he scored an unbeaten 72 of 64 balls while chasing a target of 235 against Zimbabwe in the 3rd match of the tri-series guiding India to a 4-wicket win with 4 balls to spare. He was adjudged man of the match for his match winning knock. He {{ended up with a}} series aggregate of 121 runs from 5 matches at a decent average of 40.33 and a strike rate of 101.68. He was the only batsman with a strike rate of more than 100 among those who managed to aggregate more than 100 runs in the series. In the triangular series in Sri Lanka, India lost 3 consecutive matches and was on the brink elimination from the series. In the absence of injured Tendulkar and Zaheer and suspended Ganguly, Dravid captained the side in the 4th match and led them to their first win in the series. He played crucial innings in the last three league matches contributing to three consecutive victories, thus helping India qualify for the Finals which they eventually lost to Sri Lanka. Dravid topped India's run chart for the series scoring 259 runs at an average of 51.80 and a strike rate of 59.81. Dravid followed it up with another decent show in Standard Bank tri-series in South Africa, scoring 214 runs at an average of 53.50 and a strike rate of 71.81 including 3 fifties. He also kept wickets in the final two ODIs including the Final of the series effecting 3 stumpings. By the end of the South African tour, Dravid had started experiencing problem in his right shoulder. Although he played the ensuing home test series against England, he pulled out of the 5-match ODI series against England to undergo shoulder rehabilitation programme in South Africa. He returned for the home series against Zimbabwe and had a forgettable outing in the ODI series barring the one inning of 66 not out from 59 balls in the 2nd match.|$|E

500|$|Director Kim Manners {{noted that}} the episode [...] "was a really <b>good</b> <b>show</b> for me, because I had not {{got a chance to}} work with Mitch. And they wrote a great script, you know? It was really {{something}} he could sink his teeth into and he just did a great job. Bill Davis was fabulous in that show too". This was the second episode of the series to not feature Scully, the first being the second season episode [...] "3". Guest actor Morris Panych, portraying the Syndicate assassin The Grey-Haired Man, makes his last appearance in the series in this episode. Panych had previously appeared in [...] "Piper Maru", [...] "Avatar", [...] "Herrenvolk" [...] and [...] "Memento Mori".|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{rates the}} episode [...] "A", {{welcoming}} {{the return of}} Burrows as director and calling the prom video [...] "witty character development disguised as a standard flashback."

500|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of season one of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Mary McNamara at the Los Angeles Times praised the connections between that series and the films, stating that [...] "never before has television been literally married to film, charged with filling in the back story and creating the connective tissue of an ongoing film franchise ... is now not only a very <b>good</b> <b>show</b> in its own right, it's part of Marvel's multiplatform city-state. It faces a future of perpetual re-invention, and that {{puts it in the}} exhilarating first car of television's roller-coaster ride toward possible world domination." [...] Terri Schwartz of Zap2it agreed with this sentiment, stating that [...] "the fact that [...] so influenced the show is game-changing in terms of how the mediums of film and television can be interwoven", though [...] "the fault there seems to be that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. had to bide time until The Winter Soldiers release", which led to much criticism.|$|E

500|$|Kim Manners called [...] "Grotesque" [...] his {{favorite}} third-season episode and praised David Duchovny's performance on this episode, saying [...] "Duchovny drove himself, {{and he was}} brilliant in that show." [...] Manners also said of the episode: [...] "I think 'Grotesque' is a frightening show. I {{think it is a}} disturbing show, and I think that's why—for me—it's such a <b>good</b> <b>show.</b> We pulled it off making the viewer feel uneasy. I even found it a difficult show to watch. Yeah, it was a pretty dark hour of television and I would like to do more of those." [...] In order to get a proper feel for the episode, Manners listened to the music from the 1990 film Jacob's Ladder until his wife [...] "finally asked, 'Do we have to listen to that (bleeping) CD again?'" [...] Manners also theorized that the episode may have been the template for the show Millennium, which premiered on Fox the following television season.|$|E
500|$|Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times {{felt that}} the series [...] "created a whole new sort of {{television}} show: One that must support, and change with, the plot twists of its film family ... never before has television been literally married to film, charged with filling in the back story and creating the connective tissue of an ongoing film franchise." [...] She stated that the Captain America: The Winter Soldier crossover [...] "infused S.H.I.E.L.D. with a new energy, and helped explain, perhaps, why the show {{took so long to}} find its footing—in the writers' room at least ... That Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. was able to succeed as a story both independent and ancillary is all but miraculous." [...] She concluded that the series [...] "is now not only a very <b>good</b> <b>show</b> in its own right, it's part of Marvel's multiplatform city-state. It faces a future of perpetual re-invention, and that puts it in the exhilarating first car of television's roller-coaster ride toward possible world domination." ...|$|E
500|$|William Golding's 1954 novel Lord of the Flies {{was written}} as a {{counterpoint}} to (or even a parody of) The Coral Island, and Golding makes explicit references to it. At {{the end of}} the novel, for instance, one of the naval officers who rescues the children mentions the book, commenting on the hunt for one of their number, Ralph, as a [...] "jolly <b>good</b> <b>show.</b> Like the Coral Island". Jack also makes an appearance in Lord of the Flies as Jack Merridew, representing the irrational nature of the boys. Indeed, Golding's three central characters– Ralph, Piggy and Jack– are caricatures of Ballantyne's heroes. Despite having enjoyed The Coral Island many times as a child, Golding strongly disagreed with the views that it espoused, and in contrast Lord of the Flies depicts the English boys as savages themselves, who forget more than they learn, unlike Ballantyne's boys. Golding described {{the relationship between the two}} books by saying that The Coral Island [...] "rotted to compost" [...] in his mind, and in the compost [...] "a new myth put down roots". Neither is the idyllic nature of Ballantyne's coral island to be found on Stevenson's treasure island, which is unsuitable for settlement [...] "but exists merely as a site from which to excavate treasure, a view consistent with the late-Victorian imperial mission" [...] according to Honaker.|$|E
