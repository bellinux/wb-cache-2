40|$|In this paper, we preseat {{a generic}} {{methodology}} for {{the synthesis of}} industrial robot applications with sensory feedback at the end-effector level. The presented methodology assumes an open controller architecture and leads {{to the creation of}} a library of modular and reusable entities, which can be used to build new systems based on the proposed architectural framework. The library facilitates the integration of new algorithms and it evolves as new modular applications are built. The library components belong to the control objects layer of the open controller architecture and implement functionality for sensor <b>interfacing,</b> <b>sensor</b> modeling, pattern recognition, state estimation and state regulation. The validity of the approach is verified by composing real industrial applications. The experimental results indicate the high quality of the developed systems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|In {{the search}} for more {{effective}} instruments to collect data for the identification of threats to security, health, and safety, new tools must be {{designed to meet the}} challenges of a diverse set of possible applications. The extensive range of potential applications raises the need for a general purpose system capable of addressing a wide variety of deployment environments. This thesis focuses on a wireless sensor network framework for collecting environmental data in an effort to develop a sensing solution that fits within many design spaces. The framework includes reconfigurable wireless sensor node hardware, firmware, and software for <b>interfacing</b> <b>sensor</b> networks for upstream data aggregation and sensor data fusion. The wireless sensor modules utilize mesh network architecture to allow low power radios to be effective even with low sensor module dispersion density, or in environments that have obstructions which prevent line-of-sight communications. In the current implementation, the software is designed to allow a computer to be used to monitor all sensor module activities as data is collected, request information as needed, and forward collected data to a database system for further analysis. It also supports software modules to allow different sensor data fusion and analysis algorithms to be applied to the collected data in real-time...|$|E
40|$|Today’s {{pervasive}} {{availability of}} computing devices enabled with wireless communication and location- or inertial sensing capabilities is unprecedented. The number of smartphones sold worldwide are still growing and {{increasing numbers of}} sensor enabled accessories are available which a user can wear in the shoe or at the wrist for fitness tracking, or just temporarily puts on to measure vital signs. Despite this availability of computing and sensing hardware the merit of application seems rather limited regarding the full potential of information inherent to such senor deployments. Most applications build upon a vertical design which encloses a narrowly defined sensor setup and algorithms specifically tailored to suit the application’s purpose. Successful technologies, however, such as the OSI model, which serves as base for internet communication, have used a horizontal design that allows high level communication protocols to be run independently from the actual lower-level protocols and physical medium access. This thesis contributes to a more horizontal design of human activity recognition systems at two stages. First, it introduces an integrated toolchain to facilitate the entire process of building activity recognition systems and to foster sharing and reusing of individual components. At a second stage, a novel method for automatic integration of new sensors to increase a system’s performance is presented and discussed in detail. The integrated toolchain is built around an efficient toolbox of parametrizable components for <b>interfacing</b> <b>sensor</b> hardware, synchronization and arrangement of data streams, filtering and extraction of features, classification of feature vectors, and interfacing output devices and applications. The toolbox emerged as open-source project through several research projects and is actively used by research groups. Furthermore, the toolchain supports recording, monitoring, annotation, and sharing of large multi-modal data sets for activity recognition {{through a set of}} integrated software tools and a web-enabled database. The method for automatically integrating a new sensor into an existing system is, at its core, a variation of well-established principles of semi-supervised learning: (1) unsupervised clustering to discover structure in data, (2) assumption that cluster membership is correlated with class membership, and (3) obtaining at a small number of labeled data points for each cluster, from which the cluster labels are inferred. In most semi-supervised approaches, however, the labels are the ground truth provided by the user. By contrast, the approach presented in this thesis uses a classifier trained on an N-dimensional feature space (old classifier) to provide labels for a few points in an (N+ 1) -dimensional feature space which are used to generate a new, (N+ 1) -dimensional classifier. The different factors that make a distribution difficult to handle are discussed, a detailed description of heuristics designed to mitigate the influences of such factors is provided, and a detailed evaluation on a set of over 3000 sensor combinations from 3 multi-user experiments that have been used by a variety of previous studies of different activity recognition methods is presented...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Sensor network users {{currently}} face enormous challenges, including programming {{difficulty and}} the use of unfamiliar, complex interfaces. To date, most usability research with respect to sensor networks have focused on simplifying programming by offering powerful programming abstractions. Unfortunately, such work does little to encourage ordinary users, such as application scientists, to adopt sensor networks. In order to address these issues we have developed a filesystem <b>interface</b> for <b>sensor</b> networks. By treating a sensor network as a standard Unix filesystem, users are able to use familiar tools to <b>interface</b> with <b>sensor</b> networks. This simplifies management and debugging. Similarly, programs originally designed for filesystems, such as file-sharing programs, can be used to extend sensor networks. Finally, users are also able to prototype applications using pre-existing programming environments that <b>interface</b> with the <b>sensor</b> network through the file I/O interface. I...|$|R
