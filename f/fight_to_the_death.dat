5|$|However, {{this alone}} does not explain {{the fact that they}} remained; the {{remainder}} of Thespiae was successfully evacuated before the Persians arrived there. It seems that the Thespians volunteered to remain as a simple act of self-sacrifice, all the more amazing since their contingent represented every single hoplite the city could muster. This {{seems to have been a}} particularly Thespian trait â€“ on at least two other occasions in later history, a Thespian force would commit itself to a <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>death.</b>|$|E
5|$|The game {{focuses on}} three princes in the Burning Citadel where {{they and their}} men-at-arms <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> to gain the Throne of Fire after their father's death. Throne of Fire {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from industry critics, with some reviewers speaking positive of the graphics while other criticized the lack of difficulty in the single player mode, instead recommending playing with two players.|$|E
5|$|After {{falling asleep}} that night, Sam is visited {{in a dream}} by Azazel, who reveals that he has brought them all {{together}} {{so that they can}} <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>death,</b> with the sole survivor becoming the leader of his army of demons. Admitting that he killed Sam's girlfriend Jessica because he believed she was holding him back from returning to his old life of hunting supernatural creatures, the demon then shows him the night of his mother's death. Azazel had come into Sam's nursery and fed him his blood, with Mary Winchester (Samantha Smith) walking in and recognizing the demon.|$|E

5|$|Faced {{with such}} {{conflicting}} accounts {{and unable to}} reach a conclusion, the Parlement announced on 15 September {{that the two men}} would <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> on 27 November 1386 to decide guilt in the case. If Carrouges lost, then Marguerite would be burnt at the stake for perjury. In fact, the duel was delayed a month as the King and his court, which contained most of the country's senior dukes and generals, was held up on campaign in Flanders and could not return in time. Eager to see what was rapidly becoming the event of the season, the King ordered the duel postponed until 29 December so that he would be present for its culmination.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} repatriations, {{returned}} prisoners were generally treated with pity, suspicion and disdain by French civilians. Many {{believed that they}} had only been allowed to return in exchange for agreeing to collaborate. Later Vichy propaganda had implied that prisoners lived in good conditions, so many civilians believed that the prisoners had suffered much less than civilians during the conflict. As veterans of the 1940 Battle of France, the prisoners were blamed for the French defeat and portrayed as cowards who had surrendered, rather than <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>death.</b> They were also unfavourably compared with other men of their generation who {{had served in the}} Free French Forces or Resistance.|$|E
5|$|Leonidas' {{actions have}} been the subject of much discussion. It is {{commonly}} stated that the Spartans were obeying the laws of Sparta by not retreating, but it seems it was actually the failure to retreat from Thermopylae that gave rise to the notion that Spartans never retreated. It is also possible that, recalling the words of the Oracle, Leonidas was committed to sacrifice his life in order to save Sparta. However, since the prophecy was specific to him, this seems a poor reason to commit 1,500 other men to a <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>death.</b>|$|E

5|$|The primary rooms {{include the}} Lair, Hatchery, Training Room, Library, and the Treasury. These {{have the same}} purpose as the first game: they {{function}} as a resting place, feeding place, training area, research area, and gold storage area respectively. The only major {{difference is that the}} Training Room can only train creatures up to experience level four. Further experience can only be gained through real combat, such as fighting in the new Combat Pit, where creatures <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>death.</b> The higher a creature's experience level, the stronger and more powerful they become. The highest experience level is level ten, and creatures cannot achieve levels nine or ten via the Training Room or Combat Pit.|$|E
5|$|To besiege the fortress, Ferdinand {{brought more}} than 400 Fussvolk (foot soldiers) and five squadrons of mounted soldiers, plus {{a half dozen}} heavy caliber cannons, called culverins. His soldiers, among them Spanish and Italian mercenaries, took up {{quarters}} in neighboring villages, a process accompanied by pillage, arson, murder and rape. On 18 November, {{the first day of}} the siege, Ferdinand sent a trumpeter and formally asked the fortress to surrender; the defending garrison replied that they had sworn their allegiance to Gebhard and would <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> for him.|$|E
5|$|During the night, Warwick {{ordered his}} cannons to {{continually}} bombard the estimated {{position of the}} Yorkists' encampment. The Yorkists, however, had sneaked in close, and the Lancastrian artillery overshot their enemies. The Yorkist cannon, meanwhile, kept quiet to avoid betraying their location. As the armies settled down to rest, Montagu approached his brother and advised him of the troops' low morale. He suggested that, as the highest-ranking commanders, the brothers should fight on foot throughout the battle instead of riding on horse. The soldiers believed that mounted commanders tended to abandon them when the situation deteriorated. By staying on foot, the Nevilles would show that {{they were prepared to}} <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> with the men, inspiring the troops to stand and fight harder. Warwick agreed and the horses were tethered to the rear, near Wrotham Wood.|$|E

5|$|Heavy Syrian {{shelling}} of Degania Alef {{started at}} about 04:00 on May 20 from the Samakh police station, {{by means of}} 75mm cannons, and 60 and 81mm mortars. The barrage lasted about half an hour. At 04:30 on May 20, the Syrian army began its advance on the Deganias and the bridge over the Jordan River north of Degania Alef. Unlike the attack on Samakh (Tzemah), this action saw the participation of {{nearly all of the}} Syrian forces stationed at Tel al-Qasr, including infantry, armor and artillery. The Israeli defenders numbered about 70 persons (67 according to Aharon Israeli's head count), most of them not regular fighters, with some Haganah and Palmach members. Their orders were to <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>death.</b> They had support from three 20mm guns at Beit Yerah, deployed along the road from Samakh to Degania Alef. They also had a Davidka mortar, which exploded during the battle, and a PIAT with fifteen projectiles.|$|E
5|$|By 14 August, Godwin-Austen {{realized}} the peril of his situation, with XV Brigade nearly {{able to cut}} him off from behind, his troops exhausted, and his artillery completely deficient and running low on ammunition, and informed General Henry Maitland Wilson, who was in command at Cairo while Wavell was absent in England, that retreat from Tug Argan and evacuation from British Somaliland was now a necessity. If his forces could be evacuated, perhaps 70 percent of them might be removed. Otherwise, he {{would be forced to}} <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>death,</b> with his entire command destroyed. Wilson agreed to Godwin-Austen's request the next day, and preparations were made to flee after dark on 15 August. During that day, Observation Hill was attacked for the final time by De Simone's forces. De Simone had decided to doggedly press his attack in the gap, in lieu of completing the flanking maneuver, and finally this proved successful. By 7:00pm XIII Brigade had seized Observation Hill, and the British retreated from it in disarray. After sundown, the defenders of the remaining hills were withdrawn, along with the Punjab troops, who departed just as II Brigade was able to make inroads through their abandoned positions. British resistance had collapsed, and as Godwin-Austen and his forces fled towards Berbera, the Italians were in control of Tug Argan.|$|E
5|$|During the 2004 {{crossover}} event , Black Mask commandeers Oracle's {{computers and}} satellites and engages in a <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> with Batman. In {{order to prevent}} Batman from killing his adversary, Oracle initiates the Clock Tower's self-destruct sequence, provoking Batman to rescue her rather than continue the battle. This results {{in the destruction of}} Gordon's home and headquarters in the clock tower. Subsequently, Oracle decides to move on, and leaves Gotham City altogether. She cuts her ties with Batman, and after a temporary world trip with her team, relocates to Metropolis. In the events comprising Gail Simone's Birds of Prey: Between Dark and Dawn (2005), and Birds of Prey: The Battle Within (2005), Oracle is possessed by arch-villain Brainiac, an artificial intelligence entity, in order to become a biological being. Although Oracle overpowers Brainiac and expels him from her body, the advanced virus delivered by him remains despite his absence. The virus steadily causes cybernetic attachments to sprout all over her body. Oracle develops supernatural abilities that allow her to psychically interact with computer information systems. Although she loses these abilities after the virus is rendered dormant following an operation by Doctor Mid-Nite, she discovers she can move her toes. However, this proves to be short-lived; Gordon remains paralyzed.|$|E
50|$|Some {{focus on}} the road's {{southern}} half, where the adjoining forest with its aged trees provides much actual shade from the sun on even the brightest days. Highwaymen or other bandits would supposedly lay in wait for victims in these shadows, then often cut their throats after taking what they had, or they would engage in <b>fights</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> among themselves over women.|$|R

5|$|In September 1916, the Serbian High Command sent then-Lieutenant PeÄ‡anac by air to Mehane (south-west of NiÅ¡ in the Toplica region) {{to prepare}} a guerrilla {{uprising}} {{in support of a}} planned Allied offensive. There, PeÄ‡anac contacted several groups of guerrillas, known as comitadji. PeÄ‡anac joined forces with local leader Kosta VojinoviÄ‡, and they both established headquarters on Mount Kopaonik. Rivalry quickly developed between the two leaders, mainly because PeÄ‡anac only had orders to prepare to support the planned Allied offensive, but VojinoviÄ‡ was conducting operations that might result in pre-emptive action by the Bulgarian occupation forces. Matters came to a head in Januaryâ€“ February 1917 when the Bulgarians began conscripting local Serbs for military service. At a meeting of guerrilla leaders to discuss whether they should commence a general uprising, PeÄ‡anac was outvoted. However, events had overtaken the leaders, and they were essentially joining a popular uprising that was already underway. After guerrillas under PeÄ‡anac's command engaged the Bulgarians, he was hailed as a leader of the resistance, although he had serious reservations about the eventual outcome once the Bulgarians and Austro-Hungarians committed large numbers of troops to subdue the uprising. The guerrillas were closing on NiÅ¡ in early March when the occupying forces went on the offensive. PeÄ‡anac advised his fighters to hide out in the woods and mountains, while VojinoviÄ‡ ordered his to <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>death.</b> By 25 March, the uprising had been crushed. PeÄ‡anac's participation in the rebellion came at a great personal cost; three of his children died whilst in Bulgarian internment.|$|E

25|$|Collins also cites as a {{classical}} inspiration the Roman gladiator games.

40|$|Physical fights are {{the usual}} means of {{establishing}} dominance hierarchies in animal societies. This form of dominance behaviour is most strongly expressed in honeybee queens {{who engage in}} <b>fights</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>to</b> establish themselves in the colony. Workers can also compete for reproductive dominance resulting {{in the establishment of}} stable hierarchies. They do not engage each other physically, but use pheromones that mimic those produced by queens. The dynamics of pheromone production in paired workers suggests that they engage in a pheromonal contest. Because queen pheromones suppress ovary activation, the contest results in the sterility of the loser...|$|R
