500|$|Actress Jennifer Aniston made a guest {{appearance}} on [...] "All Mixed Up". Speculations of her appearance initially surfaced a year {{prior to the}} confirmation, and upon hearing of it, Cougar Town co-creator Bill Lawrence initially supported such allegations. Lawrence stated that he announced that Aniston would appear on the television series, but had not contacted her or her representatives. Eventually, Lawrence averted away from his claims and stated that [...] "nothing's happened yet". He continued in his interview with E! Online: [...] "I'd kill to get Jennifer on the show, and if I had any inclination it was happening, I would be telling everybody 'cause I don't really give a sh-t. I would love it to happen and the second it did <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> everybody in the world, but nothing's happened." ...|$|E
500|$|Fans ask me all {{the time}} {{what it is like to}} be a rock star. I can tell that they are dreaming, as I dreamed, when I was a kid, of someday ruling the world with a rock band. I tell them the same thing <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> any young rock-star-to-be [...] you will get lonely. You will meet two hundred people every night, but each {{conversation}} will generally last approximately thirty seconds, and consist of you trying to convince them that no, you do not want their underwear. Then you will be alone again, in your motel room. Or you will be on your bus, in your little space, trying to kill the nine hours it takes to get to the next city, whichever city it is. This is the life of a rock star.|$|E
500|$|Although no {{materials}} {{appear to}} exist specifically addressing {{the composition of}} [...] "The Princess and the Pea", Andersen does speak to {{the writing of the}} first four tales of 1835 of which [...] "The Princess on the Pea" [...] is one. New Year's Day 1835, Andersen wrote to a friend: [...] "I am now starting on some 'fairy tales for children.' I am going to win over future generations, you may want to know", and, in a letter dated February 1835 he wrote to the poet, Bernhard Severin Ingemann: [...] "I have started some 'Fairy Tales Told for Children' and believe I have succeeded. I have told a couple of tales which as a child I was happy about, and which I do not believe are known, and have written them exactly the way <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> them to a child." [...] Andersen had finished the tales by March 1835 and told Admiral Wulff's daughter, Henriette: [...] "I have also written some fairy tales for children; Ørsted says about them that if The Improvisatore makes me famous then these will make me immortal, for they are the most perfect things I have written; but I myself do not think so." [...] On 26March, he observed that [...] " [...] will be published in April, and people will say: the work of my immortality! Of course I shan't enjoy the experience in this world." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{preparing}} the acoustic album, Grohl {{decided that he}} would improve it with guest appearances, and made a list of musicians {{that he would like to}} work with, such as Warren Haynes and Grant Hart. The guests that appeared on the record included Norah Jones, John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin fame, and Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age. John Paul Jones agreed to appear as he was in Los Angeles for the Grammy Awards, and Grohl described his appearance as the [...] "second-greatest thing to happen to me in my life" [...] behind his marriage. Norah Jones was brought for the bossa nova [...] "Virginia Moon" [...] after Grohl heard her record and considered that his song was [...] "her vibe" [...] and Jones' voice [...] "was so smooth and warm that I figured it would work out great with mine." [...] The song features Grohl's guitar technician Joe Beebe on lead guitar as he was the only one in the crew with jazz experience. The Wallflowers' keyboard player Rami Jaffee and that dog.'s violinist Petra Haden also contributed to the album, and were later drafted for the Foo Fighters' touring band. After the album was finished, Grohl stated that he hoped that the Foo Fighters were most remembered for this record, describing it as [...] "just the most fucking kick-ass thing we've ever done", and saying that [...] "If someone asked me which Led Zeppelin album to buy, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> them Physical Graffiti, because it has such a wide dynamic and it shows the range that band had. And that's what we wanted to do with this album." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hawkins {{said his}} {{feelings}} about Keeble echo those of all who knew him. [...] "If he was alive today, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> him there's no one I respect more, and how he is everything a man should be: brave, kind and generous. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> him how proud I am of him, and how I never realized that all this time, I was living with such greatness." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{had written}} long-form before {{but it is}} pure story-telling in script writing and that goes {{back as far as}} I can {{remember}} for me, not just with my father but with myself. I slept in the same bedroom as my sister for many years, until it became indecent to do so and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> her stories every night—that is how she would get to sleep. She would say [...] "tell me a story" [...] so <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> her a story. So that ability, I very much had that from the start and I used to enjoy that at school so actually to write a script—it suddenly felt like I was just making up a big story.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am glad of it. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>tell</b> you myself. My father has, today, {{laid his}} {{commands}} {{on me to}} marry the Sieur de Pascal." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>tell</b> you," [...] he {{suddenly}} exclaimed, turning to Theodora, [...] "and sometimes I {{think there is}} nothing you <b>would</b> not <b>tell</b> me. Tell me, then, I entreat you, what is your religion?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Also, Gulen {{said in an}} {{interview}} with NPR: [...] "To this day, I have stood against all coups. My respect for the military aside, I have always been against interventions. ...If any one among those soldiers had called me and told me of their plan, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> them, 'You are committing murder.' ... If they ask me what my final wish is, I would say the person [...] who caused all this suffering and oppressed thousands of innocents, I want to spit in his face." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Listen, {{other people}} will give you their {{versions}} of things, and I can't help that, but I myself am entitled to my own version, and I would say that I did {{the same amount of}} producing on this album as I've done on other albums, just never had my name [...] So, that was basically a really conscious decision for me, to be like, 'You know, I'm not doing anything different here than I have done in the past. Why shouldn't I be known to be doing it? You know, why shouldn't I get the credit for something that I'm actually doing?' So I just basically did it, and I didn't tell anybody, whereas the process before was, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> people that I was getting ready to do it, then we would gear up to do it, and then people would get involved, and the credit would go wherever. So I just didn't tell a single soul I was doing it, I just did it in my own studio, and it was great." ...|$|E

2500|$|On March 9, {{during a}} segment of Mad Money, Cramer admitted, [...] "OK, I'm a tempting target. Plenty of people come in and give their {{criticism}} on this show. But we're dealing with serious issues here; we need solutions, which I offer almost every night. I don't want ad hominem attacks. Take The New York Times columnist Frank Rich and Jon Stewart; I criticize Obama, so both of them seize on the urban legend that I recommended Bear Stearns the week before it collapsed, when I simply told an e-mailer that the deposit in his account at Bear Stearns was safe. 'Your money is safe in Bear Stearns,'" [...] Cramer repeated, referring to his own quote during a March 11, 2008 segment of Mad Money. Moreover, Cramer outlined, [...] "But through a clever sound bite, Stewart, and subsequently Rich—neither of whom have bothered {{to listen to the}} context of the pulled quote—pass off the notion of account safety as an out-and-out buy recommendation. If you called Mad Money and asked me about Citigroup, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> you that the common stock might be worthless, but I would never tell you to pull your money out of the bank because I was worried about its solvency. Your money is safe in Citi as I said it was in Bear. The fact that I was right rankles me even more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Listen,' she said, 'and try to understand. If I {{thought she}} hated him, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> her something. If she thought you hated them, {{he would tell}} me something.

6000|$|... "May I {{go and see}} her?" [...] said Dorothea, eagerly. [...] "Would she {{accept my}} sympathy? <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> her that {{you have not been}} blamable before any one's {{judgment}} but your own. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> her that you shall be cleared in every fair mind.

6000|$|... "Not all painful, Miss Hannay, but in parts. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> rather <b>tell</b> you, Doctor, {{when we have}} {{finished}} our journey this evening, if your curiosity {{will allow you to}} wait so long." ...|$|R
60|$|As to {{explaining}} my ejaculations, {{that was}} impossible. I thought the matter {{over and over}} again as I lay awake that night, and I determined that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never <b>tell</b> Madeline the facts of the case. It would be better for me to suffer all my life than for her to know that the ghost of her uncle haunted the house. Mr. Hinckman was away, and if she knew of his ghost she could not be made to believe that he was not dead. She might not survive the shock! No, my heart could bleed, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never <b>tell</b> her.|$|R
60|$|Thomas Ruttledge. Where are {{you going}} to? <b>I</b> wish you <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> me what you are at.|$|R

60|$|Very well; since {{silence is}} the crime, I thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> {{the world that}} Lady Byron had spoken.|$|E
