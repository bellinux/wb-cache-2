50|$|Anticoagulants {{in acute}} {{coronary}} syndrome are targeted against the coronary blood clot, as well as towards prevention of thrombotic complications, like formation of blood clots in the ventricles, stroke, pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis. Patients undergoing PCI also need an anticoagulant to prevent catheter thrombosis. Options include unfractionated heparin, enoxaparin (a low molecular weight heparin), fondaparinux (a pentasaccharide antagonist of factor Xa) and bivalirudin (a direct thrombin inhibitor); all the above agents are given parenterally (subcutaneously or intravenously). Unfractionated heparin has the disadvantage of requiring dose adjustment based on a laboratory exam, {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (APTT). <b>In</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> choice depends on the reperfusion strategy used (see below); bivalirudin is used when PCI is employed only, while in the same case fondaparinux is not preferred.

40|$|Background Recently, {{a chronic}} total {{occlusion}} (CTO) in a non-infarct-related artery (non-IRA) and not multivessel disease (MVD) alone {{was identified as}} an independent predictor of mortality after ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) constitute a patient group with a high prevalence of MVD and high mortality after STEMI. The prevalence of CTO in a non-IRA was studied {{and its impact on}} long-term mortality <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> with DM was investigated. Methods Between 1997 and 2007 4506 patients with STEMI were admitted and treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients with DM were identified. The patients were categorised as having single vessel disease (SVD), MVD without CTO and CTO based on the angiogram before PCI. Results A total of 539 patients (12 %) had DM. MVD with or without a CTO was present in 33 % of non-diabetic patients and in 51 % of diabetic patients. The prevalence of a CTO in a non-IRA was 21 % <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> with DM and 12 % <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> without DM (p < 0. 01). Kaplan-Meier estimates for 5 -year mortality <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> with DM were 25 %, 21 % and 47 % in patients with SVD, MVD without a CTO and MVD with a CTO in a non-IRA, respectively. A CTO in a non-IRA was an independent predictor of 5 -year mortality (HR 2. 2, 95 % CI 1. 3 to 3. 5, p < 0. 01).

The {{purpose of our}} {{study was to determine}} the prognostic value of RV dysfunction on admission <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> presenting in CS. Two hundred and ninety-two consecutive STEMI patients with CS on admission were treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) from January 1997 through March 2005. RV function was assessed by measurement of tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) on early echocardiography in 184 of 292 patients. Right ventricular dysfunction was defined as a TAPSE of < 14 mm. Right ventricular dysfunction was present on early echocardiography in 70 of 184 patients (38 %). The Kaplan-Meier estimate for overall 4 -year survival was 57 %. Kaplan-Meier estimates for 4 -year survival in patients with and without RV dysfunction were 33 and 73 %, respectively (P < 0. 001).

BackgroundThe positive effect of reperfusion after STEMI may be compromised by ischemic/reperfusion injury. HMGB 1 is released by necrotic cells and, in pre-clinical studies, has been implicated {{to play a role}} in myocardial ischemic/reperfusion injury. MethodsThe study included 141 STEMI patients, with acute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery successfully treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. Plasma HMGB 1 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay at admission. Forty-two healthy individuals served as control subjects. ResultsAfter a median of 10 months of follow-up, 13 STEMI patients died. There were no significant differences with regard to baseline variables between the group of patients who survived and those who died. Baseline HMGB 1 levels were increased <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> when compared with control subjects. Furthermore, the STEMI patients who died had higher HMGB 1 levels than those who survived. After adjusting for age, sex, troponin I, and creatine kinase-myocardial band, we found that a doubling of HMGB 1 concentrations increased the risk of mortality by 75 % (hazard ratio: 1. 75; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 1 to 2. 8). ConclusionsPlasma HMGB 1 levels are elevated <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> compared with healthy control subjects. Furthermore, after a follow-up period of 10 months, plasma HMGB 1 levels are shown to be independently associated with increased mortality <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> treated with PCI.

40|$|AbstractThe {{incidence}} of ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is around 66 STEMI per 100000 of population/year, with 6 – 12 % hospital mortality in unselected patients [1]. Modern treatment strategies for STEMI {{are based on}} immediate antithrombotic treatment and primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation. Therapy {{with a combination of}} two or even three more potent antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents reduces both short-term and long-term ischemic risk, morbidity and mortality; on the other hand it is associated with higher risks of bleeding. The first part of this review is focused on the pathogenesis of thrombi <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> and antithrombotic drugs currently used to treat STEMI patients. In the second part we discuss several factors that can affect bleeding risks including the choice of access site for coronary angiography, prevention and treatment of bleeding <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients.</b> Finding a balance which minimizes both thrombotic and bleeding risk is crucial, although, it can be difficult and further randomized studies directed at finding this balance are needed...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether direct ambulance transport of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients to a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) hospital (field triage) leads to a lower 30 -day mortality compared to transport via a referral non-PCI hospital (referral via a spoke centre) <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients.</b> METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a systematic review of interventions. An experienced librarian searched in PubMed, EMBASE. com and The Cochrane Library (via Wiley) from January 1980 -February 2013. Studies that examined field triage and/or referral via a spoke centre <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> treated with primary or facilitated PCI were included. Two authors independently conducted the study selection and data extraction. Multivariable frequency weighted logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the effect of the type of transfer on the outcome measures. We identified 14 randomised clinical trials (RCTs), including 20 transfer groups and 4474 participants. Thirty-day mortality was lower in patients who underwent field triage (3. 0 %; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 2. 2 - 4. 2) compared to patients who were referred via a spoke centre (4. 7 %; 95 % CI 4. 0 - 5. 5). In multivariable frequency weighted logistic regression analysis, field triage was independently associated with a lower incidence of 30 -day mortality (odds ratio (OR) : 0. 58; 95 % CI 0. 37 - 0. 89).

40|$|Introduction: Patients with ST {{elevation}} {{myocardial infarction}} (STEMI) require rapid identification and triage to initiate reperfusion therapy. Walk-in <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> have longer treatment times compared to {{emergency medical service}} (EMS) transported patients. While effective triage {{of large numbers of}} critically ill patients in the emergency department is often cited as the reason for treatment delays, additional factors have not been explored. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate baseline demographic and clinical differences between walk-in and EMS-transported <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> and identify factors associated with prolonged door to balloon (D 2 B) time <b>in</b> walk-in <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients.</b> Methods: We performed a retrospective review of 136 <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> presenting to an urban academic teaching center from January 2009 through December, 2010. Baseline demographics, mode of hospital entry (walk-in versus EMS transport), treatment times, angiographic findings, procedures performed and in-hospital clinical events were collected. We compared walk-in and EMS-transported <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> and identified independent factors of prolonged D 2 B time for walk-in patients using stepwise logistic regression analysis. Results: Walk-in patients (n= 51) were more likely to be Latino and presented with a higher heart rate, higher systolic blood pressure, prior history of diabetes mellitus and were more likely to have an elevated initial troponin value, compared to EMS-transported patients. EMS-transported patients (n= 64) were more likely to be white and had a higher prevalence of left main coronary artery disease, compared to walk-in patients. Door to electrocardiogram (ECG), ECG to catheterization laboratory (CL) activation and D 2 B times were significantly longer for walk-in patients. Walk-in patients were more likely to have D 2 B time > 90 minutes, compared to EMS- transported patients; odds ratio 3. 53 (95 % CI 1. 03, 12. 07), p = 0. 04.  Stepwise logistic regression identified hospital entry mode as the only independent predictor for prolonged D 2 B time. Conclusion: Baseline differences exist between walk-in and EMS-transported <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> undergoing primary PCI. Hospital entry mode was the most important predictor for prolonged treatment times for primary PCI, independent of age, Latino ethnicity, heart rate, systolic blood pressure and initial troponin value.

Results: CD 34 +/KDR+, CD 34 +/KDR+/CD 45 dim, CD 34 +/KDR+/CD 45 -, EPCs were related to extent of AAR (rho = 0. 51, p= 0. 05; rho = 0. 55, p= 0. 03; rho = 0. 72, p= 0. 002, respectively), while no relationships were detected with IS, MS or LG-MVO. Conclusions: Our data show that EPCs were strongly correlated to extent of myocardial AAR, thus suggesting that progenitor cells mobilization <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> develops <b>in</b> response to myocardial ischemia and not to myocardial necrosi...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Platelets play {{a crucial}} role in the {{pathogenesis}} of acute coronary syndromes. Accordingly, previous studies showed increased platelet reactivity on admission in these patients. In this study we assessed platelet reactivity at short-medium term follow-up in patients with ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI). Materials and methods: Fifty-nine patients (58 ± 11 years, 45 men), treated with primary angioplasty, were studied 1 month after STEMI. Thirty-five patients were retested at 6 months. Twenty matched patients with stable coronary artery disease served as controls. Platelet reactivity was assessed by flow cyometry at rest and at peak exercise, with and without adenosine diphosphate (ADP) stimulation, by measuring monocyte-platelet aggregates (MPAs) and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (CD 41) expression in the MPA gate, and CD 41 and fibrinogen receptor (PAC- 1) expression in the platelet gate. Results: Compared to controls, basal MPAs and CD 41 in the MPA gate were higher <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> both at 1 month (p = 0. 001 and p = 0. 002, respectively) and at 6 months (p = 0. 03 and p = 0. 01, respectively). Basal CD 41 and PAC- 1 expression was also higher <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> at the two assessments compared to controls (P < 0. 001 for both). Exercise induced a similar increase in platelet reactivity in patients and controls. ADP induced a higher increase in CD 41 platelet expression <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> compared to controls both at 1 and 6 months (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: Platelet reactivity is increased in the first 6 months after STEMI. The persistence of increased platelet reactivity in this time period may play a role in the early recurrence of coronary events after STEMI...|$|E
40|$|Background Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) {{have been}} {{investigated}} in small studies in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents did not show a clear effect on left ventricular function or clinical outcome, but some studies suggested {{an increased risk of}} thromboembolic events. Methods A systematic literature search in MEDLINE was performed, until December 2012. We included randomized clinical trials investigating the effect of ESAs <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> undergoing primary PCI, with >= 30 days of follow-up. The primary end point was a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and stent thrombosis after PCI. Secondary end point was all-cause mortality. Results Individual patient data were obtained from 10 of 11 trials, including 97. 3 % (1, 242 / 1, 277) of all patients randomized to control (n = 600) or to ESAs (n = 642). Baseline characteristics were well balanced between the treatment allocations. Mean follow-up time was 248 (+/- 131) days. The primary end point occurred in 3. 5 % (20 / 577) in the control group and in 2. 1 % (13 / 610) in the ESA group (hazard ratio for ESAs, 0. 63; 95 % CI [0. 31 - 1. 27]; P =. 20). Mortality occurred in 13 (2. 3 %) in the control group and 5 (0. 8 %) in the ESA group (hazard ratio for ESAs, 0. 38; 95 % CI [0. 13 - 1. 06]; P =. 06). Conclusions Erythropoiesis-stimulating agent administration does not result in an increased risk of adverse cardiac events <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> undergoing primary PCI. Results of ongoing studies may provide further insight to the potential beneficial clinical effects of ESAs <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: Myocardial {{transverse}} {{relaxation time}} (T 2, ms) {{is a fundamental}} magnetic property of tissue that is related to water content and mobility. The pathophysiological and prognostic importance of native myocardial T 2 in acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (<b>STEMI)</b> <b>patients</b> is unknown. We aimed to assess the clinical significance of native T 2 within the infarct core using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. Methods: We performed a prospective single center cohort study <b>in</b> reperfused <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> who underwent CMR 2 days and 6 months post-MI. T 2 -weighted CMR (investigational prototype T 2 -prepared TrueFisp sequence) was measured in myocardial regions-of-interest. The infarct territory and microvascular obstruction were depicted with late gadolinium enhancement CMR. All-cause death or heart failure hospitalization was a pre-specified outcome that was assessed during follow-up. Results: 324 <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> (mean±SD age 59 ± 12 years, 237 males, 121 with anterior STEMI) gave informed consent and had CMR (14 July 2011 - 22 November 2012).

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that erythrocytes are a potential component in atheromatous lesions and thrombus formation in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the associations of red blood cell (RBC) component of coronary thrombi with oxidative stress and myocardial reperfusion. Aspirated thrombi from 178 <b>STEMI</b> <b>patients</b> within 12 h of symptom onset were investigated immunohistochemically using antibodies against platelets, RBCs, fibrin, macrophages, and neutrophils [myeloperoxidase (MPO) ]. The thrombi were divided into tertiles according to the percentage of glycophorin-A-positive area: low (glycophorin-A-positive area 33; n 60), intermediate (54 to 33; n 59), and high group (epsilon 54; n 59). We also measured plasma MPO levels on admission. In the thrombi, the number of MPO-positive cells in the high-RBC group was significantly greater than that in the low-RBC group (high, 927 385; intermediate, 765 406; low, 279 220 cells/mm(2); P 0. 0001). Plasma MPO levels were significantly higher in the high-RBC group than that in the low-RBC group [low 43. 1 (25. 071. 6); intermediate 71. 0 (32. 9111. 2); high 74. 3 (31. 1126. 4) ng/mL; P 0. 005]. Distal embolization occurred more frequently in the high-RBC group (P 0. 0009). Moreover, the signs of impaired myocardial reperfusion, as indicated by incomplete ST-segment resolution (STR) and lower myocardial blush grades (MBG), and progression of left ventricular remodelling at 6 months were frequently observed in the high-RBC group (high vs. low: STR, P 0. 056; MBG, P 0. 01; remodelling, P 0. 01). The present study demonstrated that erythrocyte-rich thrombi contain more inflammatory cells and reflect high thrombus burden, leading to impaired myocardial reperfusion <b>in</b> <b>STEMI</b> <b>patient...</b>|$|R
