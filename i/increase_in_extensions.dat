40|$|Faster-cycling PCR formulations, protocols, and {{instruments}} {{have been developed}} to address the need for increased throughput and shorter turn-around times for PCR-based assays. Although run times can be cut by up to 50 %, shorter cycle times have been correlated with lower detection sensitivity and increased variability. To address these concerns, we applied Compartmentalized Self Replication (CSR) to evolve faster-cycling mutants of Taq DNA polymerase. After five rounds of selection using progressively shorter PCR extension times, individual mutations identified in the fastest-cycling clones were randomly combined using ligation-based multi-site mutagenesis.

40|$|The slow plastic {{deformation}} of a metal subject o an applied stress, usually at a value below the elastic limit, is called creep. Our previous {{results on the}} mech-anism of corrosion fatigue (1, 2) suggested that a metal deforms plastically much more readily when it is actively corroding. According to this viewpoint a cor-roding metal should also exhibit accelerated creep. This expectation was confirmed for brass and for pure copper by Revie and Uhlig (3, 4). The effect was large: A corrosion rate for 0. 027 cm diam Cu wire cor re-sponding to 0. 9 mA/cm 2 accounted for a 600 % <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>extension</b> over its corresponding <b>extension</b> <b>in</b> air, independent of any thinning caused by the corrosion process.

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to examine the effect of {{prenatal}} breech presentation on postnatal leg posture. Twelve infants were born after breech presentation and nine infants after cephalic presentation participated. At 2, 4, 6, 12 and 18 weeks postnatal age leg posture was examined during general movements in supine and vertical position. Results: Transient differences in hip posture between the groups were observed during the first 6 weeks postnatal age, with significantly more hip flexion and less hip <b>extension</b> <b>in</b> the breech group. For knee extension, differences between the groups were not statistically significant. Changing from supine to vertical position, the breech group demonstrated a significant <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> hip <b>extension,</b> with no significant changes in hip posture for the cephalic group. For both groups the vertical condition resulted <b>in</b> a significant <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> knee <b>extension.</b> Continuity from pre- to postnatal life was found for hip posture in both groups and for knee <b>extension</b> only <b>in</b> the breech group. Conclusions: Significant differences between breech and cephalic-born infants were found during the first 6 weeks after birth and mainly concerned hip posture and not knee posture. An <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> gravitational force has more impact on leg posture in the breech than in the cephalic group. The observed differences in hip posture between the studied groups were found to be transient, however, in the long term subtle differences still remain between the groups.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of two frequently used non-operative treatment techniques for a stiff knee after total knee arthroplasty. Sixty-four patients with a stiff knee after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) were randomized into a manipulation under anaesthesia group, or a low load stretch (stretch) group. The patients were followed up for 6 weeks and were evaluated for maximum flexion and extension, range of motion (ROM), pain, stiffness and function. Both groups showed a significant <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> knee flexion in this study. Only the stretch group showed a significant <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>extension</b> ROM. <b>In</b> both groups, a significant <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> Western Ontario and McMaster Universities was observed. No significant difference was observed between both groups for the flexion or extension ROM, or for any of the pain, function or stiffness scores during this study. The results of this study showed that the stretch technique had equal or superior results concerning ROM and function compared to manipulation under anaesthesia. The stretch technique achieved this without requiring the patient to undergo in-hospital treatment or anaesthesia, limiting the costs and the risks for complications. The results of this study showed that stretching is a valuable tool for treating joint contractures of the knee. Therefore, the use of this stretching technique may be an excellent first choice of treatment modality in patients with slow progress of knee flexion or persistent knee stiffness following TKA, prior to manipulation under anaesthesia or lysis of adhesions...|$|R
40|$|Global {{warming is}} {{affecting}} agribusiness in its economic aspects. Therefore, {{the prediction of}} the evolution of Brazilian beef cattle production cost was made using the IPCC forecast scenario for global warming. The methodology consisted of two steps: (i) the development of a fuzzy model that estimated the grazing land capacity (RP) decrease risk {{as a function of the}} changes in the average total rain index, air temperature and <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>extension</b> of the dry season; and (ii) the design of an algorithm for predicting the decrease in production as function of the RPfuzzy model, that results in the impact in beef cattle productivity, and consequent <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> production costs. Historical environmental data from important producing counties in the Cerrado were organized and a set of fuzzy Gaussian functions were developed, and three possible settings (optimistic, medium and pessimistic) were considered. The decrease in beef cattle productivity was estimated using the losses in production due to the <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> air temperature and vulnerability of pasture capacity. The boundary settings for the total increase of production cost scenario used the number of animals per area of grazing land, the adoption of grain supplement and its future scenario; and the result output function pointed to a threshold within a variation from an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> production cost of 80 % (optimistic) to 160 % (pessimistic).

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} how knee kinematics, kinetics and loading changes during sidestepping tasks following a prolonged running protocol {{performed in a}} laboratory setting. Design: All participants performed sidestepping, and crossover cutting tasks in a randomised order before and after a 60 min running protocol on a non-motorised treadmill that simulated an AF game. Methods: Eight healthy male participants who partook in semi-professional and amateur Australian Football undertook a series of straight line runs, sidestepping (SS), and crossover cutting (XO) tasks before and after a simulated game of Australian football. Kinematic data were analysed at initial foot contact of the SS and XO manoeuvres and kinetic data were analysed during the weight acceptance phase of the stance. Results: The knee was significantly more flexed at foot contact following fatigue compared to pre-fatigue states. Fatigue was also a factor contributing to significant <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> internal knee <b>extension</b> moments. Significant differences were also observed between SS and XO trials with flexion/extension moments, with notable differences in varus/valgus and internal/external rotation moments.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the effects of {{external}} work rate on joint specific power and the relationship between knee extension power and vastus lateralis muscle oxygen consumption (mVO 2). We measured kinematics and pedal forces and used inverse dynamics to calculate joint power for the hip, knee and ankle joints during an incremental cycling protocol performed by 21 recreational cyclists. Vastus lateralis mVO 2 was estimated using near-infrared spectroscopy with an arterial occlusion. The main finding was a non-linear relationship between vastus lateralis mVO 2 and external work rate that was characterised by an increase followed by a tendency for a levelling off (R 2 = 0. 99 and 0. 94 for the quadratic and linear models respectively, p< 0. 05). When comparing 100 W and 225 W, there was a â¼ 43 W <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> knee <b>extension</b> but still a â¼ 9 % decrease in relative contribution of knee extension to external work rate resulting from a â¼ 47 W <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> hip <b>extension.</b> When vastus lateralis mVO 2 was related to knee extension power, the relationship was still non-linear (R 2 = 0. 99 and 0. 97 for the quadratic and linear models respectively, p< 0. 05). These results demonstrate a non-linear response in mVO 2 relative to a change in external work rate. Relating vastus lateralis mVO 2 to knee extension power showed a better fit to a linear equation compared to external work rate, but it is not a straight line...|$|R

40|$|The {{amount of}} waste tyres being dumped is fast {{becoming}} a problem. These stockpiles take up valuable land and are an environmental and health problem. While incineration is {{the simplest way to}} recycle the used tyres it isnât an efficient way to dispose of tyres. This research looks at developing a method for characterizing the New Reclamation Group (NRG) reclaim with the main focus on Hi-Resâ¢ thermogravimetric analysis. Good quantification was possible using this technique. A trade off was established between resolution, sensitivity and time. While increasing the resolution allowed greater separation to be achieved the time for each experiment increased rapidly. Although kinetic models do exist for quantifying rubber components in vulcanized sample, they were not suitable for this study. When devulcanization causes significant molecular changes, such as with NRG reclaim, the decomposition profiles no longer match those of virgin materials. Formulations developed focused on mixing, rheometry, crosslink density and tensile properties. The NRG reclaim acted as a processing aid which lowered the maximum torque. This provides mixing safety as the temperature is decreased {{as a result of the}} lower torque. This effect was not seen with conventional reclaim. Rheometry tests indicated that the addition of the devulcanizates decreased the extent of cure. It was demonstrated that this could be linked to crosslink density. Testing of the 100 %, 200 %, 300 % moduli correlated the crosslink density to the maximum torque. Although the addition of NRG reclaim reduced the tensile strength of the formulation, a link between crosslink density and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) couldnât be made. The decrease in the UTS and <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>extension</b> at break is possibly caused by an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> low molecular weight material present in the formulations and decrease in crosslink density.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{hippocampus}} and its 5 -hydroxytryptamine transmission {{plays an}} important role in depression related to its involvement in limbic circuit plasticity. METHODS: The analysis was made with bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, co-immunoprecipitation, in situ proximity ligation assay, binding assay, in cell western and the forced swim test. RESULTS: Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer analysis, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR 1) - 5 -hydroxytryptamine 1 A (5 -HT 1 A) receptor complexes have been demonstrated and their specificity and agonist modulation characterized. Their presence based on co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay has also been indicated in hippocampal cultures and rat dorsal hippocampal formation showing a neuronal location. In vitro assays on extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 phosphorylation have shown synergistic <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> signaling on coactivation with fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF 2) and a 5 -HT 1 A agonist, and dependent on the heteroreceptor interface. In vitro and in vivo studies also revealed a 5 -HT 1 A agonist induced phosphorylation of FGFR 1 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 in rat hippocampus without changing FGF 2 levels. Co-activation of the heteroreceptor also resulted <b>in</b> synergistic <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>extensions</b> of PC 12 cells and neurite densities and protrusions in primary hippocampal cultures dependent on the receptor interface. The combined acute and repeated intracerebroventricular treatment with FGF 2 and 8 -OH-DPAT was found to produce evidence of highly significant antidepressant actions in the forced swim test. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that neurotrophic and antidepressant effects of 5 -HT in brain may, in part, be mediated by activation of the 5 -HT 1 A receptor protomer in the hippocampal FGFR 1 - 5 -HT 1 A receptor complex enhancing the FGFR 1 signaling...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundAxial {{compression}} injuries of the cervical spine {{occur during}} contact sports, automobile collisions, and falls. The {{objective of this}} study was to use flexibility tests to determine biomechanical instability of the cervical spine due to simulated axial compression injuries. HypothesisWe hypothesized that the axial compression injuries cause severe biomechanical instability throughout the cervical spine. Materials and methodsThe injuries were simulated using 2. 4 m/s head-first impacts of a cadaveric cervical spine model (n= 10) mounted horizontally to a torso-equivalent mass on a sled and carrying a surrogate head in protruded posture. Intact and post-impact flexibility tests were performed up to 1. 5, 3, and 1. 5 Nm in flexion-extension, axial torque, and lateral bending, respectively. Instability parameters of range of motion (RoM) and neutral zone (NZ) were determined for injured spinal levels and statistically compared (P< 0. 05) between intact and post-impact. ResultsThe sagittal instability parameters indicated extension-compression injuries at the upper and middle cervical spine and flexion-compression injuries at the lower cervical spine. <b>Increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>extension</b> RoM were 14. 9 Â° at the upper cervical spine and 24. 9 Â° (P< 0. 05) at the middle cervical spine and in flexion RoM at C 7 /T 1 were 25. 6 Â°. RoM and NZ <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> axial rotation and lateral bending were nearly symmetric among left and right. DiscussionMultidirectional instability of the upper cervical spine caused by atlas and dens fractures was evidenced by increases between 36 % and 53 % in RoM and NZ due to the impacts. The sagittal RoM of injured spinal levels of the middle and lower cervical spine exceeded a proposed threshold for clinical instability by between 67 % and 114 %. The instability documented throughout the cervical spine was consistent with clinical observations of cord injuries and paralysis in patients.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} of the physiology underlying the increased rates of stem extension induced by simulated shade light quality. Vegetational shade light quality was simulated by the addition of supplementary far red light (FR) to background white light (WL). FR was given either to the whole plant, or to specific parts of the plant using interference filters combined with fibre optics to determine the site of FR photoperception. For the whole plant irradiations, supplementary FR was given for several days, throughout the main photoperiod. For the short FR treatments used in the fibre optics experiments, small rapid changes <b>in</b> <b>extension</b> rate were measured using a linear displacement transducer. The results indicate that supplementary FR can modulate stem <b>extension</b> rate <b>in</b> fully light grown plants following perception by either the leaves or the stem. Neither the apical nor the axillary meristems are required for the response to FR. Extension rate is most rapidly controlled by the light environment of the stem itself; supplementairy FR given to the stem will induce an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>extension</b> rate after a lag period of only 13 min. The rapid effect of FR to the stem is only partially reversed by a return to WL. Supplementary FR given to the leaves stimulates stem extension only after a lag period of approximately 3 h, and there is no rapid reversal of the increased extension rate induced by FR irradiation of the leaves on return to WL. In the physiologically simpler system of the de-etiolated pumpkin seedling at the cotyledonary stage, hypocotyl extension {{is directly related to the}} estimated phytochrome photoequilibrium established in the cotyledon. In fully light grown plants, the effect of long term supplementary FR on stem extension can be reduced by the inhibitor of gibberellin synthesis, CCC. Furthermore, long term supplementary FR produces an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> endogenous gibberellin levels in both the leaf and stem, compared with plants grown in WL. A model is proposed to account for the action of FR, operating through Photosystem I via effects on cyclic photophosphorylation, and through phytochrome, controlling the release and synthesis of gibberellin...|$|R
40|$|Background: Students {{at school}} and {{university}} settings {{have been shown to}} carry heavy loads in a variety of pack systems. Both type and mode of load carriage have been shown to cause significant postural adaptations that can lead to injuries in the shoulder, arms, hands and back. Whilst backpacks have been well researched, there is a paucity of literature on the effects of frontpacks, shoulder bags and hand-held bags on 3 D posture and back shape. Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of carrying three different types of bag (shoulder, front and handheld), each containing a load of 15 % body weight. Materials: The Integrated Shape Imaging System 2 (ISIS 2) was used to evaluate 3 D back shape and posture. Participants: The study involved twenty-five university students. A repeated measures design was used to record the effects of four conditions using no load (reference), a frontpack, a shoulder bag and a handheld bag. Measurements with ISIS 2 were taken 5 minutes post loading. All of the conditions were randomised in an attempt to offset any order effects. Results showed an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>extension</b> and lumber lordosis angles for the front bag (P< 0. 001) and an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> flexion and reduced lumber lordosis in the shoulder and hand held bags (p< 0. 05). Kyphosis curves were also significantly <b>increased</b> <b>in</b> the hand held bag (p< 0. 006). Right unilateral load carriage also demonstrated the greatest right volumetric asymmetry. Discussion: Bilateral front carriage as supported by previous literature produces a symmetrical shift away from the load. Unilateral carriage however produces an asymmetrical deviation away from the load which results in significant postural deviations and adaptations. Conclusion: Frontbags may be more suitable for load carriage within the young adult student population as they produce a symmetrical postural deviation in one plane in response to load. The shoulder and handheld bags produce postural deviations in all planes which may cause adverse stress and strain on spinal structures and ultimately lead to pain and progressive postural scoliosis...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: White matter hyperintensities (WMH) {{are common}} on brain MRI of the elderly. Their size ranges from punctate to early {{confluent}} to confluent lesions. While this <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>extension</b> is frequently seen as {{evidence for a}} continuum of changes, histological data and clinical follow-up suggest differences in underlying pathology and their progression. METHODS: We tested this hypothesis by exploring the distributions of punctuate and confluent lesions using lesion probability maps (LPM) generated from MRI scans of 189 participants (mean age 60. 8 +/- 6. 2 years) in the Austrian Stroke Prevention Study. We dichotomised WMH according to the classification by Fazekas et al. [punctate (n= 143) vs. early confluent and confluent (n= 33) ] to run voxel-based t-tests using permutation-based nonparametric inference. To test alternative hypotheses, we created similar LPM for age and arterial hypertension. RESULTS: We observed {{significant differences in the}} spatial distribution of lesions for the two WMH groups (p< 0. 01). Punctate lesions were more diffusely distributed throughout the cerebral white matter (peak probability approximately 5 %) relative to confluent lesions (peak probability 45 %). Confluent lesions had greatest likelihood of being found in perfusion "watershed" regions. These differences in distribution could not be explained by differences in age or hypertension only, as both greater age and the diagnosis of hypertension were associated with WMH abutting the occipital horns. CONCLUSIONS: Punctate and early confluent to confluent WMH show distinguishable differences in their spatial distribution within a normal elderly population. The pattern of punctate WMH is probably a consequence of mixed etiologies. Preferential localization of the more confluent WMH with arterial watershed areas implies a stronger ischemic component in their development...|$|R

Generally, all of the ligatures tested experienced an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the <b>extension</b> to TS over time. The pre-stretching procedure used in this study did not produce any long-term detrimental effects on the TS and extension to TS of the ligatures tested. Conclusions: The results of this study confirm there are differences <b>in</b> TS, and <b>extension</b> to TS between clear and coloured elastomeric ligatures, and that some significant differences also exist between different brands of elastomeric ligatures...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 9 th Annual Symposium on Graduate Research and Scholarly Projects (GRASP) held at the Marcus Welcome Center, Wichita State University, May 8, 2013. Research completed at the Department of Physical Therapy, College of Health ProfessionsThe purpose {{of this investigation was}} to test the assumption that the application of heat will produce a greater <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> muscle strength as compared to the application of ice. Thirty-five male and female university students were randomly distributed into three groups: cryotherapy (ice) group (IG), heat group (HG), or control group (CG). Each participant performed a three minute warm-up on a standard Airdyne stationary cycle. Pre-test measures for fiverepetition maximum knee extension strength were obtained for each participant by use of an isokinetic dynamometer. After intervention, post-test measures were obtained using the same parameters. Although no significant difference was observed between groups, trends tend to show an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> knee <b>extension</b> strength following the application of a heat modality.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an <b>increasing</b> {{interest}} <b>in</b> <b>extensions</b> of the logic programming paradigm beyond the class of normal logic programs motivated by the need for a satisfactory respresentation and processing of knowledge. An important problem in this area is to find an adequate declarative semantics for logic programs. In the present paper a general preference criterion is proposed that selects the `intended' partial models of extended generalized logic programs which is a conservative extension of the stationary semantics for normal logic programs of [13], [15] and generalizes the WFSX-semantics of [12]. The presented preference criterion defines a partial model of an extended generalized logic program as intended if it is generated by a stationary chain. The GWFSX-semantics is defined by the set-theoretical intersection of all stationary generated models, and thus generalizes the results from [9] and [1]. 1 Introduction Declarative semantics provides a mathem [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScPhysio (Physiotherapy)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. Introduction Decreased hip <b>extension</b> <b>in</b> the paretic leg is {{a common}} {{impairment}} after stroke. Gluteal taping was introduced as a technique that helped <b>in</b> <b>increasing</b> hip <b>extension</b> of the paretic leg, and step length in the unaffected leg. The {{aim of this study}} was to further investigate the effect of gluteal taping on other temporal spatial and kinematic parameters using a 3 D motion analysis system (Moven System). Methods The study was conducted in two phases. Phase 1 entailed examining the intra trial reliability of the Moven System, where eight subjects were recruited and tested twice at their normal pace of walking, and twice again at their maximum speed. Phase 2 involved studying the effect of gluteal taping on temporal spatial and kinematic parameters. Thirty subjects participated and were tested under three taping conditions (no tape, therapeutic tape, and placebo tape), while walking at their self selected walking speed. Intra-class correlation coefficient ICC determined around 95 % confidence intervals was used to examine the intra trial reliability of the Moven System. Repeated measures-ANOVA was used to study the temporal spatial, and kinematic variables during the three taping conditions. Results The Moven showed moderate to excellent reliability in measuring the gait variables including temporal spatial parameters and sagittal kinematic parameters in addition to the lateral pelvic tilt. Taping caused significant <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> hip <b>extension</b> and reduction <b>in</b> knee flexion at terminal stance for the paretic leg. There was a trend toward better hip flexion at terminal stance, and a mild trend toward more planter flexion at terminal stance. Both treatment and placebo tapes caused an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> the step lengths of either leg, and a significant <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> gait velocity and cadence. Conclusion Gluteal taping may be beneficial in producing important clinical effects post stroke, and can be used as an adjunct strategy during gait rehabilitation. Further research is needed to understand the mechanism of how taping produces effects, and to further explore its effect on kinetic and muscle activation variables...|$|R
40|$|An Analysis/Synthesis Audio Codec (ASAC) is presented, {{which allows}} the coding of audio signals at very low bit rates for {{applications}} like mobile communication or multimedia database access via modem and analog telephone lines. Compression with bit rates between 6 kbit/s and 24 kbit/s is addressed. Furthermore the implementation of special effects like independent pitch change and speed change in the decoder is described. 1 Introduction Many applications for very low bit rate storage and transmission of digital audio signals mainly focus on speech signals. Therefore a lot of optimizations for speech codecs operating at bit rates between 6 and 16 kbit/s were carried out during the past years. However there is an <b>increasing</b> interest <b>in</b> <b>extensions</b> which also allow the transmission of music signals in areas like mobile communications or multimedia database access via modem and analog telephone lines [1]. The presented Analysis/Synthesis Audio Codec is therefore designed to represent musi [...] ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceContinental {{extension}} {{is forming}} the Gulf of Corinth across the strike of earlier Alpine evolution. Here, we present the first deep reflection sections with pre-stack depth-migration processing across the deep basin of the Corinth active rift, which image structures unpredicted by current models. Resolving the infill as {{a pile of}} layers that are broken by faults allows one to follow their subsidence and deformation history. Variation among the profiles suggests that southern normal faults control the rift in a time progression from the east towards its western tip. On the central, DerveniâItea transect, a 3 -km widening of the basin accrued since the initiation of this control that is marked by an unconformity between the two main sedimentary units. This is estimated to have occurred 0. 5 â 0. 6 Myr ago, assuming the glacio-eustatic sea-level changes have controlled the stratigraphy of sediments deposited as a succession of layers on the subsiding hangingwall, as they did on the southern footwall in forming the famous flight of marine terraces of Corinth. A roll-over anticline and crestal collapse graben are diagnostic of the control by a normal fault of dip varying with depth. The deeper low-angle part of this bi-planar fault is indeed imaged as a reflector in the basement. The occurrence of the collapse with a breakaway at the steep southern basin-bounding fault of the hangingwall slab can be estimated 0. 12 â 0. 2 Myr ago, with a marked <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>extension</b> rate that brought it to its present fastest value over 10 mm/yr. The low-angle part of the active fault might also have controlled earlier evolution upslope and in the basin. When compared with inferences from earthquake studies, this low-angle active fault may {{not appear to be}} seismogenic but may participate to the seismic cycle, possibly in a conditionally stable regime. Active faults seen as sea-bottom scarps merely accommodate deformation of its subsiding hangingwall. The footwall of the low-angle faults, which current seismicity shows to be <b>in</b> <b>extension,</b> appears then as being pulled out from beneath the rift, in a motion towards the rolling-back slab that causes the Hellenic subduction retreat...|$|R
