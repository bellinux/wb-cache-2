Total discordance was observed in only three cases (1. 5 %). The agreement between model and experts was excellent (kappa = 0. 98, P <. 0001) or substantial (kappa = 0. 69, P <. 0001) when considering the overestimative accordance (accordance was considered when at least one diagnosis was equal) and the underestimative discordance (discordance was considered when at least one diagnosis was different), respectively.

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed {{to assess whether}} urinary {{germanium}} concentration {{can be used as}} a biomarker of inhalation exposure to airborne dust from metallic germanium (Ge) or GeO 2 in the occupational setting. A novel hydride generation-based method coupled with fow-injection graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (HG/FI-GFAAS) was developed for the determination of urinary germanium. It was found that urinary germanium concentration could be reliably determined by a standard additions method after thorough digestion of the urine and careful pH adjustment of the digest. The limit of detection (LOD) in urine for the HG/FI-GFAAS method was 0. 25 microg Ge L(- 1). In Belgian control male subjects, the urinary germanium concentration was below this LOD. In 75 workers currently exposed to inorganic germanium compounds, respirable and inhalable concentrations of germanium in the aerosols were measured on Monday and Friday at the job sites using personal air samplers. Spot-urine samples were collected on the same days before and after the work shift. The germanium concentrations of respirable dust correlated very well with those of inhalable dust and represented 20 % of the inhalable fraction. Workers exposed to metallic Ge dust were on average ten times less exposed to germanium than those whose exposure involved GeO 2 (3. 4 versus 33. 8 microg Ge m(- 3)). This difference was reflected in the urinary germanium concentrations (3. 4 versus 23. 4 microg Ge g(- 1) creatinine). Regression analysis showed that the concentration of germanium in the inhalable fraction explained 42 % of the post-shift urinary germanium concentration either on Monday or on Friday, whereas in a subgroup of 52 workers mainly exposed to metallic germanium dust 57 % (r = 0. 76) of the Monday post-shift urinary germanium was explained. <b>Urinary</b> <b>elimination</b> kinetics were studied in seven workers exposed to airborne dust of either metallic Ge or GeO 2. The <b>urinary</b> <b>elimination</b> rate of germanium was characterised by half-times ranging from 8. 2 to 18. 1 h (on average 12 h 46 min). The present study did not allow discrimination between the germanium species to which the workers were exposed, but it showed fast <b>urinary</b> <b>elimination</b> kinetics for inhalation exposure to dust of metallic Ge and GeO 2.

40|$|Excessive {{glucocorticoid}} hormone, as {{occurs with}} Cushing syndrome, {{is known to}} be associated with altered body water homeostasis, but the molecular mechanisms are unknown. In this study, rats treated with daily dexamethasone (Dex) for 14 d provided a model of Cushing syndrome. Compared with control rats, Dex-treated rats demonstrated increased mean arterial pressure, urine flow rate, and urinary excretion of both sodium and urea. Dex-treated rats had increased abundance of aquaporin 1 (AQP 1), AQP 3, and Na-K- 2 Cl co-transporter proteins and a marked reduction of the urea transporters UT-A 1 and UT-A 3. In response to an acute water load, Dex-treated rats increased water excretion more than control rats, but both groups exhibited similar AQP 2 expression. In response to fluid deprivation, Dex-treated rats demonstrated an <b>impaired</b> <b>urinary</b> concentrating capacity: Urine flow rate was higher and urine osmolality was lower than control rats despite an increase in AQP 1, AQP 3, and Na-K- 2 Cl co-transporter expression. AQP 2 expression was similar between the two groups, but UT-A 1 and UT-A 3 were decreased and urinary urea excretion was increased in Dex-treated rats. Because Dex-treated rats ingested less food and water compared with controls, paired food and water studies were performed; these substantiated the previous results. In summary, the alterations in body water observed with glucocorticoid excess may be a result, in part, of <b>impaired</b> <b>urinary</b> concentrating capacity; downregulation of UT-A 1 and UT-A 3 and increased urea excretion may contribute to this impairment...|$|R

40|$|Meso- 2, 3 -dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA, or succimer) is an oral {{chelating}} agent for heavy-metal poisoning. While studying the <b>urinary</b> <b>elimination</b> of unaltered DMSA, altered DMSA (i. e., its mixed disulfides), and lead {{in children with}} lead poisoning, we observed a pattern of <b>urinary</b> drug <b>elimination</b> after meals suggestive of enterohepatic circulation. The excretion of lead in urine patterned the elimination of altered DMSA rather than the parent molecule. In addition, the half-life of elimination of DMSA via the kidney was positively associated with blood lead concentration. Two additional crossover studies of DMSA kinetics were conducted in normal adults to confirm the presence of enterohepatic circulation of DMSA after meals. In one, increases in plasma total DMSA concentration were observed after meals in all six subjects; these increases were prevented by cholestyramine administration 4, 8, and 12 hr after DMSA. In the second, the administration of neomycin also prevented increases in DMSA after meals.
