500|$|... "The Middle," [...] {{the second}} single from the album, {{includes}} a guitar solo that, according to Adkins, [...] "is {{a tribute to}} Doug Gillard of Guided by Voices". Its lyrics speak about [...] "fitting in" [...] and self-acceptance of oneself. In turn, [...] "Sweetness" [...] {{was one of the}} songs that Adkins had more doubts about because of its lyrical content: [...] "I just had this melody in my <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was demoing it and singing it and kind of having a hard time with it. I almost didn’t bring it to the band because I was thinking to myself, ’I can’t just say nothing. I can’t just use all these sort of alyrical whoahs for this much of a song.’" ...|$|E

500|$|Diane Warren wrote [...] "Un-Break My Heart" [...] in 1995. When {{asked about}} her songwriting process, she said that songs usually come to her from a title, a chorus, or a drum beat. [...] "Un-Break My Heart" [...] was {{conceived}} from its title, and, according to Warren, [...] "it popped into my <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> thought, 'I don't think I've heard that before, that's kind of interesting.' I started playing around on the piano with these chords and did a key change, and then I knew, 'OK, this is magic.'" [...] Warren further explained that she wrote [...] "Un-Break My Heart" [...] as a ballad and dance song, {{because that was the}} way she heard it. She said: [...] "some people only know it as a – gay – dance song!" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Skipper Dan", a style {{parody of}} Weezer, was {{released}} on July 14, 2009. The song describes {{a man who has}} a fine arts degree and dreamed of pursuing an acting career, but is forced to work as a tour guide on the Jungle Cruise ride at Disneyland. Yankovic later explained in an interview with The A.V. Club that the song was [...] "a bit more poignant [...] bittersweet [...] than what I usually write." [...] He was inspired to write the song after going on a ride on the Disneyland Jungle Cruise with his family. During the cruise, one of the tour guides referred to his failed acting career. Yankovic then noted that [...] "the bells went off in my <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> thought, [...] "Well, here's a song right here."" ...|$|E
500|$|After a minute, Sirhan {{wrestled}} {{free and}} grabbed the revolver again, but he had already fired all the bullets and was subdued. [...] Barry went to Kennedy and laid his jacket under the candidate's head, later recalling: [...] "I knew immediately it was a [...]22, a small caliber, so I hoped it wouldn't be so bad, but then I saw {{the hole in the}} Senator's <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> knew". Reporters and photographers rushed into the area from both directions, contributing to the confusion and chaos. As Kennedy lay wounded, Juan Romero cradled the senator's head and placed a rosary in his hand. Kennedy asked Romero, [...] "Is everybody OK?" [...] and Romero responded, [...] "Yes, everybody's OK." [...] Kennedy then turned away from Romero and said, [...] "Everything's going to be OK." [...] Captured by Life photographer Bill Eppridge and Boris Yaro of the Los Angeles Times, this moment became the iconic image of the assassination. There was some initial confusion in who was shot, one witness believing that the primary victim was Kennedy's campaign manager, Stephen Edward Smith. This was quickly realized to be untrue.|$|E

500|$|Unlike Madonna's {{previous}} two lead singles, [...] "4 Minutes" [...] (2008) and [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'" [...] (2012), [...] "Living for Love" [...] puts {{the emphasis on}} the lyrics and vocals, with the lines on the bridge going like [...] "Took me to heaven, let me fall down/Now that it's over, I'm gonna carry on" [...] and a [...] "throbbing drop" [...] in the middle. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine described the song as Kiesza meets [...] "Like a Prayer", and noted that there were many changes from the leaked demo version: the throwback house music being replaced by an 808 pulse sound and Keys' piano, as well as handclaps and gospel riffing being removed {{towards the end of the}} song. For Jon Lisi from PopMatters, [...] "Living for Love" [...] fitted with contemporary pop music releases and the DIY ethic they displayed, starting from Taylor Swift's [...] "Shake It Off", to Ariana Grande's [...] "Break Free" [...] and Katy Perry's [...] "Roar". The survivor anthem-like nature of the track was evocative of Madonna's survival in her music career. With NRJ the singer herself explained the meaning behind the lyrics: [...] "It's a song having your heart broken but it's about saying you know what I'm going to my life goes on, I will carry on, I won't stop believing in love, I'll pick up my crown, put it back on my <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> will walk through life proudly believing that love, true love does exist." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna also {{performed}} the song at the 2015 Brit Awards, on February 25. However, {{in the early}} stages of the performance, a wardrobe malfunction caused her to be pulled down a flight of stairs that made up part of the stage. It was later revealed that since her cape was tied tightly, when her dancers attempted to remove it from her neck, she fell down to the floor. However Madonna then continued the performance as planned. She later took to Instagram to confirm that she was well, posting [...] "Thanks for the good wishes! I'm fine". Richard Smirke from Billboard praised the performance and Madonna's recovery, saying that [...] " [...] didn't let the fall affect her performance and quickly recovered to deliver a slickly choreographed routine that mirrored the matador theme of her recent Grammy Awards performance." [...] Madonna explained on The Jonathan Ross Show that she was told to start walking towards the stage further than originally planned. Hence her team thought that the cape could have slid off and tied it tightly round her neck. The singer had two choices when the cape did not come undone, [...] "I could either be strangled or fall, and I chose to fall". Madonna endured a whiplash and added that she [...] "smacked the back of my <b>head.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> had a man standing over me with a flashlight until about 3 am to make sure I was compos mentis". The singer jokingly added that she would not use any cape for further performances and attributed her prompt recovery to having good core strength and her daily exercise routine. The accident led to an increase in viewership of the awards show. According to the British Phonographic Industry, the event resulted a 95% increase in Twitter activity about the show compared with the previous year, with an exchange of 7.8million tweets, while 6.8million viewers tuned in to watch the performance. The singer's fall was voted the most shocking [...] "Celebrity Moment of 2015" [...] by UK's Channel 5.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2011, {{days before}} the release of The Hangover Part II, {{director}} Todd Phillips said that [...] "there already are plans for a third film but no script or start date". About the possibility of The Hangover Part III, Phillips stated, [...] "If we were to do a third one, if the audience, if the desire was there, I {{think we have a}} very clear idea where that would head. It's certainly not in the same template that you've seen these movies. The third would be very much a finale and an ending. The most I could say about it, what's in my <b>head,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> haven't discussed it with these actors, {{is that it is not}} following that template but very much a new idea.

2500|$|The {{script was}} written by Victor Miller, who later went on to write for several {{television}} soap operas, including Guiding Light, One Life to Live and All My Children. Miller delighted in inventing a serial killer {{who turned out to}} be somebody's mother, a murderer whose only motivation was her love for her child. [...] "I took motherhood and turned it on its <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think that was great fun. Mrs. Voorhees was the mother I'd always wanted—a mother who would have killed for her kids." [...] Miller was unhappy about the filmmakers' decision to make Jason Voorhees the killer in the sequels. [...] "Jason was dead from the very beginning. He was a victim, not a villain." [...] The idea of Jason appearing at the end of the film was initially not used in the original script, and was actually suggested by makeup designer Tom Savini. Savini stated that [...] "The whole reason for the cliffhanger at the end was I had just seen Carrie, so we thought that we need a 'chair jumper' like that, and I said, 'let's bring in Jason'".|$|E
2500|$|During the Fragile Tour, Wakeman bought {{four books}} {{at an airport}} bookstall in Richmond, Virginia, {{including}} one about Henry VIII and his six wives titled The Private Life of Henry VIII (1964) by Scottish writer Nancy Brysson Morrison. As he read about Anne Boleyn on the subsequent flight to Chicago, a theme he recorded in November 1971 ran through his mind which he wrote on some hand drawn ledger lines and played during the sound check and the subsequent concert. Said Wakeman, [...] "I had been searching for a style to write in and suddenly I found it in writing music about these six ladies...I would concentrate {{on one of the}} wives and then music just came into my <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> would write it down. Sometimes I was flying, other times I was on stage, or {{just in front of the}} piano at home ... The six wives theme gave me the thread, the link, I needed to give me a reason for putting these pieces of music together." [...] He explains the album's concept further in its liner notes: [...] "The album is based around my interpretations of the musical characteristics of the wives of Henry VIII. Although the style may not always be in keeping with their individual history, it is my personal conception of their characters in relation to keyboard instruments." [...] Wakeman elaborated and wrote the music as if he was doing a surreal painting, [...] "sketches of how I felt about them at the time".|$|E
2500|$|Billie Whitelaw {{worked with}} Beckett for 25 years on such plays as Not I, Eh Joe, Krapp's Last Tape, and Footfalls and Rockaby. She first met Beckett in 1963. In her {{autobiography}} she describes {{their first meeting}} in 1963 was [...] "trust at first sight". Beckett went on to write many of his experimental theatre works for her. She came {{to be regarded as}} his muse, the [...] "supreme interpreter of his work", perhaps most famous for her role as the mouth in Not I. She said of the play Rockaby: [...] "I put the tape in my <b>head.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> sort of look in a particular way, but not at the audience. Sometimes as a director Beckett comes out with absolute gems and I use them a lot in other areas. We were doing Happy Days and I just did not know where in the theatre to look during this particular section. And I asked, and he thought for a bit and then said, 'Inward' [...] ". She said of her role in Footfalls: [...] "I felt like a moving, musical Edvard Munch painting and, in fact, when Beckett was directing Footfalls he was not only using me to play the notes but I almost felt that he did have the paintbrush out and was painting." [...] "Sam knew that I would turn myself inside out to give him what he wanted", she explained. [...] "With all of Sam's work, the scream was there, my task was to try to get it out." [...] She stopped performing his plays in 1989 when he died.|$|E
