Sulfur in the assumed form of ammonium sulfate accounted for 67 % of the average <b>fine</b> <b>particle</b> mass and had a very high correlation with <b>fine</b> <b>particle</b> mass (r= 0. 99). Other measured species, includiqg carbon and nitrate, made only minor contributions to the fine mass. Peak sulfate concentrations, averaged over 6 -h intervals, exceeded 50 [mu]g m- 3. Nitric acid concentrations showed strong daytime maxima and on a 24 h basis were about four times those of <b>fine</b> <b>particle</b> nitrate.

The fuzzy c-mean (FCM) clustering algorithm is used to classify fourteen-year (2001 – 2014) observations, totally of 6, 732 records, into six aerosol types. They are identified as <b>fine</b> <b>particle</b> nonabsorbing, two kinds of <b>fine</b> <b>particle</b> moderately absorbing (fine-MA 1 and fine-MA 2), <b>fine</b> <b>particle</b> highly absorbing, polluted dust, and desert dust aerosol. These aerosol types exhibit obvious optical characteristics difference. While five of them show similarities with aerosol types identified elsewhere, the polluted dust aerosol has no comparable prototype. Then the membership degree, a significant parameter provided by fuzzy clustering, is used to analyze internal variation of optical properties of each aerosol type. Finally, temporal variations of aerosol types are investigated. The dominant aerosol types are polluted dust and desert dust in spring, <b>fine</b> <b>particle</b> nonabsorbing aerosol in summer, and <b>fine</b> <b>particle</b> highly absorbing aerosol in winter.

5|$|Some animals {{actively}} seek to hide by decorating {{themselves with}} {{materials such as}} twigs, sand, or pieces of shell from their environment, to break up their outlines, to conceal the features of their bodies, and to match their backgrounds. For example, a caddis fly larva builds a decorated case and lives almost entirely inside it; a decorator crab covers its back with seaweed, sponges and stones. The nymph of the predatory masked bug uses its hind legs and a 'tarsal fan' to decorate its body with sand or dust. There are two layers of bristles (trichomes) over the body. On these, the nymph spreads an inner layer of <b>fine</b> <b>particles</b> and an outer layer of coarser particles. The camouflage may conceal the bug from both predators and prey.|$|E

These experiments were conducted over 8 two-day periods during February 11 – 26, 1999, using filter-based samplers and cascade impactors operated at ambient relative humidity {{which was in the}} range of 80 – 89 % relative humidity over 83 % of the period sampled. <b>Fine</b> <b>particle</b> concentrations (D_a< 1. 8 μm) averaged 17. 7 (± 0. 22) μg m^(− 3) and varied between 8. 4 (± 0. 33) – 24. 7 (± 0. 21) μg m^(− 3) over the period studied. Sulfate ion and carbonaceous aerosols are the largest contributors to the <b>fine</b> <b>particle</b> mass concentration, accounting for 33 – 37 % and 26 – 27 % of the fine mass, respectively.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} organic compound-based receptor {{model is}} developed that can simultaneously apportion the source contributions to atmospheric gas-phase organic compounds, semivolatile organic compounds, <b>fine</b> <b>particle</b> organic compounds, and <b>fine</b> <b>particle</b> mass. The model {{is applied to}} ambient data collected at four sites in the south coast region of California during a severe summertime photochemical smog episode, where the model determines the direct primary contributions to atmospheric pollutants from 11 distinct air pollution source types. The 11 sources included in the model are gasoline-powered motor vehicle exhaust, diesel engine exhaust, whole gasoline vapors, gasoline headspace vapors, organic solvent vapors, whole diesel fuel, paved road dust, tire wear debris, meat cooking exhaust, natural gas leakage, and vegetative detritus. Gasoline engine exhaust plus whole gasoline vapors are the predominant sources of volatile organic gases, while gasoline and diesel engine exhaust plus diesel fuel vapors dominate the emissions of semivolatile organic compounds from these sources during the episode studied at all four air monitoring sites. The atmospheric <b>fine</b> <b>particle</b> organic compound mass was composed of noticeable contributions from gasoline-powered motor vehicle exhaust, diesel engine exhaust, meat cooking, and paved road dust with smaller but quantifiable contributions from vegetative detritus and tire wear debris. In addition, secondary organic aerosol, which is formed from the low-vapor pressure products of gas-phase chemical reactions, {{is found to be}} a major source of <b>fine</b> <b>particle</b> organic compound mass under the severe photochemical smog conditions studied here.

40|$|Two {{chemical}} {{mass balance}} receptor models are developed which {{can determine the}} source contributions to atmospheric pollutant concentrations using organic compounds as tracers. The first model uses particle-phase organic compounds to apportion the primary source contributions to atmospheric fine particulate organic carbon concentrations and <b>fine</b> <b>particle</b> mass concentrations. The second receptor model simultaneously uses both volatile gas-phase hydrocarbons and particle-phase organic compounds as tracers to determine source contributions to non-methane organic gases in the atmosphere. Both models are applied to data collected in California's San Joaquin Valley during two severe wintertime air pollution episodes. Source contributions to <b>fine</b> <b>particle</b> air quality are calculated for two urban sites, Fresno and Bakersfield, and one background site, Kern Wildlife Refuge. Primary particle emissions from hardwood combustion, softwood combustion, diesel engines, meat cooking, and gasoline-powered motor vehicles contribute on average 79 % of the airborne <b>fine</b> <b>particle</b> organic compound mass at the urban sites during both episodes with smaller but still measurable contributions from <b>fine</b> <b>particle</b> road dust and natural gas combustion aerosol. Anthropogenic primary particle sources contribute less than 10 % of the <b>fine</b> <b>particle</b> mass concentration at the background site. The combined gas-phase and particle-phase organic compound receptor model shows that gasoline-powered motor vehicle exhaust and gasoline vapors are the largest contributors to non-methane organic gases concentrations followed by natural gas leakage. Smaller but statistically significant contributions to organic vapors from wood combustion, meat cooking, and diesel exhaust also are quantified...|$|R
