25|$|The Group is the {{executive}} body of Mercosur, and is coordinated by the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of the member states. Its basic duties are to cause compliance with the Asuncion Treaty and to take resolutions required for implementation of the decisions made by the Council. Furthermore, it can initiate practical measures for trade opening, coordination of macroeconomic policies, and negotiation of agreements with nonmember states and international agencies, participating when need be in resolution of controversies under Mercosur. It {{has the authority to}} organize, coordinate and supervise Work Subgroups and to call special meetings to deal with issues of interest. Composition: The Common Market Group shall be made up of four permanent members and four alternates from each member state, representing the following public agencies: (i) the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; (ii) the Ministry of Economy, or the equivalent (from industry, foreign affairs and/or economic coordination); and (iii) the Central Bank. The members of the Common Market Group appointed by a given member state will constitute the National Section of the Common Market Group for that particular nation. Meetings: The Common Market Group will meet ordinarily at least once every quarter in the member states, in rotating alphabetical order. Special meetings may be freely called at any time, at any previously scheduled place. The meetings will be coordinated by the Head of the Delegation of the <b>host</b> <b>member</b> <b>state.</b> Decision Making: Common Market Group decisions shall be made by consensus, with the representation of all member states. The official Mercosur languages will be Portuguese and Spanish, and the official version of all work papers will be prepared {{in the language of the}} country hosting the meeting.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{case-law}} of the EU Court of Justice (ECJ) on {{the rights}} of third-country nationals (TCNs) reveals the introduction of an 'integration exception': guarantees of equal treatment of TCNs are not applicable if the measures causing uneqaul treatment aim to promote the TCNs' integration in the <b>host</b> <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> As a result equal treatment of TCNs, including in the field of social rights, is made subject to a requirement of prior integration. This chapter analyses the case law on the integration exception and sheds light on its doctrinal and theoretical implications.

Several mechanisms would be feasible, such as the student-proposing deferred acceptance mechanism. Fernández-Huertas Moraga and Rapoport (2014, 2015) recommend the country-proposing deferred acceptance mechanism by which countries would first propose visas for refugees, and refugees would decide whether to accept them or not in successive rounds. In practice, the mechanism simply requires collecting the preferences of both countries and refugees or asylum seekers. These preferences would {{take the form of}} a ranking of preferred destinations for refugees, in particular stating clearly which countries they would be unwilling to move to at all, and a ranking of preferred types of refugees for <b>hosting</b> <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> The algorithm for the mechanism can then be programed and run in a centralized way, and the solution would be exactly the same as the solution to the game of proposals and counter-proposals.|$|R

40|$|The {{author in}} its Dissertation thesis {{deals with the}} concept of worker under the free {{movement}} rights in EU law. Following the introduction, the thesis itself focuses on the positive and negative delimitation of the concept. One of the core chapters of the "positive part" tries to find an answer on the research question whether any "Keck-like" principle exists as a criterion for defining obstacles to the free movement of workers. The aim of the chapter is to find an answer what shall be subsumed under the obstacles to free movement of workers and what are <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> left with to regulate freely on their territories. In regard with the negative delimitation of the concept, the author deals with the diversion between workers and non-economically active citizens of the EU.

40|$|While {{the case}} {{law of the}} Court of Justice has been {{supportive}} of foreign incorporations and cross-border corporate mobility in Europe, many problems still persist in practice. This report analyses these practical problems and the relevant domestic rules, followed by normative recommendations. First, the statistical analysis revealed that corporate mobility is only a partial reality in the EU. Second, an empirical survey of lawyers from all <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> found, inter alia, that there is considerable legal uncertainty regarding {{the subject matter of}} this report in many of the <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> and that respondents support a possible harmonisation of conflict of laws rules. Third, the comparative part of the report provides a thorough analysis of the conflict of laws rules applicable to companies in all 28 <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> based upon reports drafted by national correspondents from each <b>Member</b> <b>State.</b> Fourth, in the normative analysis, we recommend harmonisation of the relevant conflict of laws rules in a new ‘Rome V Regulation’. This should generally be based on the incorporation theory, but it should also provide tools to protect the public interests of <b>host</b> <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> The study also provides suggestions for a possible directive on seat transfers...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s, certain European Union (EU) {{initiatives}} {{such as the}} Erasmus programme provided the opportunity to {{a great number of}} academics, researchers and students to move for {{a relatively short period of}} time to other EU <b>member</b> <b>states</b> in order to enhance their skills and improve their career potential (a phenomenon known as ‘brain circulation’). The popularity of particular <b>member</b> <b>states</b> such as Italy, Spain, Germany and the United Kingdoom has gradually created an influx of highly skilled staff especially from the less developed EU <b>member</b> <b>states,</b> from Southern Europe and the former Eastern European countries. The proposed changes in the EU Higher Education and Research frameworks during the 1990 s and the 2000 s encupsulated in the Bologna and Lisbon initiatives respectively, have had controversial results. In addition, the internationalisation and to a great extent the (competitive) commercialisation of Higher Education (HE) has left many EU <b>member</b> <b>states</b> behind since they failed to reform their national HE systems. A masive exodus of academics and researchers was observed from 2008 until 2017, mainly from the countries that suffered more the consequeses of the economic crisis (Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece and Cyprus). The destination (host) countries included primarily locations within the EU, with the most popular being the the UK and Germany. The mass emigration of academic staff within and outside the EU (‘brain drain’) is causing loss of highly skilled human capital with catastrophic consequenses for the sending (home) countries.

40|$|Benefit tourism as a {{problematic}} aspect in the EU Benefit tourism {{is a topic}} which has gotten {{quite a lot of}} media attention lately, has influenced the lives of mobile EU citizens as well as the EU itself in connection with the brexit. The aim of this thesis is to provide the reader with a comprehensive portrait of the topic, and to explore how is this phenomenon reflected in the case-law of the Court of Justice of the EU. In addition to dealing with the political context and the notion of benefit tourism, this thesis explores the free movement of persons based on both, the economic and the non-economic basis. The focus of the thesis lays on the case-law of CJEU relative to the access of economically inactive EU citizens to the social assistance systems of the <b>host</b> <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> particularly the judicial chain Brey - Dano - Alimanovic - García-Nieto. These judgments are revolutionary in a way, because for the first time, the Court took into account also the "public finances" argument which has been raised by the <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> for years and the CJEU has always been adamant on rejecting it in favour of wider interpretation of social rights.

40|$|Directive 114 / 08 on the {{identification}} and designation of European Critical Infrastructures (ECI) and {{the assessment of the}} need to improve their protection provides a common approach for assessing those infrastructures which destruction or disruption would have a significant impact not only on the <b>hosting</b> <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> but also on one or more neighbouring ones. This new branch of the EU framework require <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> and its Infrastructures' Operators to put in place new efforts in order to fulfill the goals of the Directive and, above all, the need to collaborate in order to identify and designate the ECIs and the need to draft a so-called "Operator Security Plan" for the designated infrastructures. All the <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> have implemented this Directive, but the overall assessment gives back a very patchy snapshot: success stories and strong commitment shown by very proactive <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> contrast with examples of pure formal compliance. The diversification of national implementation is in line with the principle of institutional autonomy; however, this substantive fragmentation in the legislation of the different <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> does not help the achievement of the goals set in the directive itself. This paper aims at addressing the main issues of such a fragmented implementation of the Directive 114 / 08 /EC and assessing its critical hurdles. The paper therefore searches for the reference models (previous European legislations, best practices and standards) {{that could be used for}} efficiently drafting those OSPs; and then, it studies which lessons can be learned from those <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> which deal with the protection of vital infrastructures in very effective and efficient instruments. When discussing these issues, the paper focuses on the Romanian experience as a case study of strong commitment to the European policies. In Romania, in fact, when transposing the Directive into national law (ORDONANTA DE URGENTA 98 / 2010), the government has taken the opportunity to amend the National framework about CIP (extending it to 10 sectors). This choice extends the same identical model for {{the identification}}, designation and protection of both National and European CIs and implies that all the designated National Critical Infrastructures shall draft Operator Security Plans.
