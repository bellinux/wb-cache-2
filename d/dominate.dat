5|$|This shark's {{behavior}} and social structure {{is not well}} understood. In South Africa, white sharks have a dominance hierarchy depending on the size, sex and squatter's rights: Females <b>dominate</b> males, larger sharks <b>dominate</b> smaller sharks, and residents <b>dominate</b> newcomers. When hunting, great whites tend to separate and resolve conflicts with rituals and displays. White sharks rarely resort to combat although some individuals have been found with bite marks that match those of other white sharks. This suggests that when a great white approaches too closely to another, they react with a warning bite. Another possibility is that white sharks bite to show their dominance.|$|E

A graph is a weak <b>dominating</b> pair graph {{if it has a}} <b>dominating</b> pair. Further, a graph {{is called a}} <b>dominating</b> pair graph if each of its connected induced subgraphs is a weak <b>dominating</b> pair graph. <b>Dominating</b> pair graphs form a class of graphs containing interval, permutation, cocomparability, and asteroidal triple-free graphs. Our purpose is to study the structural properties of <b>dominating</b> pair graphs. Our main results are a polar theorem for the <b>dominating</b> pairs in weak <b>dominating</b> pair graphs and an existence theorem for minimum cardinality connected <b>dominating</b> sets that induce a simple path in connected <b>dominating</b> pair graphs of diameter not equal to three. Furthermore, we present a forbidden induced subgraph characterization of chordal <b>dominating</b> pair graphs...|$|R

A connected <b>dominating</b> set is a <b>dominating</b> set such that the induced subgraph of the set is a connected graph. A graph is called distance-hereditary if every induced path is a shortest path. In this note, we give a complete description of the (inclusionwise) minimal connected <b>dominating</b> sets of connected distance-hereditary graphs in the following sense: If G is a connected distance-hereditary graph that has a <b>dominating</b> vertex, any minimal connected <b>dominating</b> set is a single vertex or a pair of two adjacent vertices. If G {{does not have a}} <b>dominating</b> vertex, the subgraphs induced by any two minimal connected <b>dominating</b> sets are isomorphic. In particular, any inclusionwise minimal connected <b>dominating</b> set of a connected distance-hereditary graph without <b>dominating</b> vertex has minimal size. In other words, connected distance-hereditary graphs without <b>dominating</b> vertex are connected well-dominated. Furthermore, we show that if G is a distance-hereditary graph that has a minimal connected <b>dominating</b> set X of size at least 2, then for any connected induced subgraph H it holds that the subgraph induced by any minimal connected <b>dominating</b> set of H is isomorphic to an induced subgraph of G[X]...|$|R

This work is motivated by cooperative communication in ad hoc networks whereby transmitting independent copies of a packet generates diversity and combats the effects of fading.

Then, several heuristic algorithms, global and local, for constructing a small extended <b>dominating</b> set are proposed. These are nontrivial extensions of the existing algorithms for the regular <b>dominating</b> set problem. The application of the extended <b>dominating</b> set in efficient broadcasting is also discussed. The performance analysis includes an analytical study in terms of approximation ratio and a simulation study of the average size of the extended <b>dominating</b> set derived from the proposed algorithms.
