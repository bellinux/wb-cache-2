40|$|January,. 19 5 o Summary. [...] An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} into the flutter characteristics of an idealised tab {{system in which the}} three degrees of freedom normal translation of the lifting surface, rotation of the control surface, and rotation of the tab are represented. Specific cases of this idealised system represent similar idealised forms of the standard trimming, spring, servo, and <b>geared</b> <b>tab</b> systems. From a consideration of tile relationships existing between the systems, criteria for flutter prevention have been developed from the criteria evolved earlier for trimming tabs 1. As initially derived, the criteria are applicable to the stick-fixed condition (in the case of spring and servo-tabs), to the case with no aerodynamic balance on either control surface or tab, and to tile case where the control surface is statically balanced about its hinge. Comparison is made between the criteria for spring-tabs and tile existing Collar-Sharpe criteria~, ~. Design implications are deduced from the criteria for spring-tabs, and the general application of the criteria to actual systems is considered in some detail. A comprehensive survey of the results is given in section 11. Points of major importance are as follows: [...] (a) The criteria are liberally provided with generalised constants whose values can if necessary be adjusted i...|$|E
50|$|A {{tab stop}} on a {{typewriter}} is a location where the carriage movement is halted by mechanical <b>gears.</b> <b>Tab</b> stops are set manually, and pressing the tab key causes the carriage {{to go to}} the next tab stop. In text editors on a computer, the same concept is implemented simplistically with automatic, fixed tab stops.|$|R
50|$|All control {{surfaces}} of the aircraft are aerodynamically balanced via set-back hinges and <b>geared</b> <b>tabs.</b> The flaps and airbrakes are operated using the aircraft's hydraulics, while the ailerons, elevators, and rudder are manually-actuated. The design of the control circuits allows for an Collins-built A.P.103 autopilot to be incorporated. Each aircraft is typically equipped with a de-icing system, which uses a mixture of bleed air from the engines, TKS fluid for general airframe, and AC electric windshield heating to prevent ice formation. From the type's introduction to service, weather radar was incorporated into the aircraft's avionics fit out. Some operators, such as the Royal Air Force, have equipped their 125s with electronic countermeasures to defend against hostile missile attacks upon the aircraft.|$|R
40|$|A {{method to}} design sidestick {{controllers}} for general aviation aircraft with reversible flight controls is proposed. The {{use of a}} sidestick {{in this type of}} flight vehicle generally increases the stick forces required for maneuvering; this is due to a reduction in the moment arm of application of the force. In the present study, the reduction of stick forces is achieved by incorporating <b>geared</b> <b>tabs</b> in the control-surface design. A complete analysis using the rigid-body aircraft longitudinal equations of motion and stick-force equation in coupled form is carried out. Lateral stick forces are predicted by solving the single-degree-of-freedom roll approximation and aileron stick-force equations. Data are presented for configurations with various tab areas and a wide range of gearing ratios. The results indicate that the method can be used successfully for geared-tab design and stick-force prediction. It is shown that gearing-ratio selection is critical but that tab area does not {{have a significant impact on}} the magnitude of stick forces and stick force to stick deflection gradients...|$|R

The damping device has been applied to a modern fighter-type jet-powered airplane. The rudder was made to float with the relative wind by the addition of trailing-edge strips. In order to amplify the floating tendency (by reducing the restoring moment), a highly <b>geared</b> balancing <b>tab</b> was incorporated.

2500|$|As the Spitfire {{gained more}} power {{and was able to}} fly at greater speeds the {{possibility}} was that pilots would encounter aileron reversal so the Supermarine design team set about redesigning the wings to counter this possibility. The original wing design had a theoretical aileron reversal speed of , which was somewhat lower than that of some contemporary fighters. The new wing of the Spitfire F Mk 21 and its successors was designed to help alleviate this problem; the wing's stiffness was increased by 47%, and a new design of aileron using piano hinges and <b>geared</b> trim <b>tabs</b> meant that the theoretical aileron reversal speed was increased to [...]|$|R

40|$|The design, {{fabrication}} {{and flight}} testing of a powered elevator {{system for the}} Augmentor Wing Jet STOL Research Aircraft (AWJSRA or Mod C- 8 A) are discussed. The system replaces a manual spring tab elevator control system that was unsatisfactory in the STOL flight regime. Pitch control in the AWJSRA is {{by means of a}} single elevator control surface. The elevator is used for both maneuver and trim control as the stabilizer is fixed. A fully powered, irreversible flight control system powered by dual hydraulic sources was designed. The existing control columns and single mechanical cable system of the AWJSRA have been retained as has been the basic elevator surface, except that the elevator spring tab is modified into a <b>geared</b> balance <b>tab.</b> The control surface is directly actuated by a dual tandem moving body actuator. Control signals are transmitted from the elevator aft quadrant to the actuator by a linkage system that includes a limited authority series servo actuator...|$|R
