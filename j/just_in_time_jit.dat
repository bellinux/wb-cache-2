40|$|Although {{inventory}} management has significantly {{developed in the}} past years as a management discipline, its application is still minimal in the service industry and government. In contrast, {{it is an important}} tool for any company that is running a competitive business. The management of some companies considers inventory as an asset, not a liability. In addition, in companies in which the use and application of inventory models are common, they can still experience inventory problems. This paper analyzes the weakness of the traditional and most popular inventory model: The Economic Order Quantity model (EOQ). Many of the inventory models available are difficult to understand because they are based on complicate mathematical and statistical formulas. The benefits that computer software have simplifying the use of mathematical formulas are diminished because some of them do not include special applications or solutions when a variation in the assumption of the models is present. When a company implements The <b>Just</b> <b>in</b> <b>Time</b> philosophy (<b>JIT),</b> the management of inventory does not rest in complex formulas. Inventory experts need to emphasize the application of the models instead of the statistical derivation. They also need to be more aggressive in making managers, students and government authorities more aware of managing the inventory levels effectively. The responsibility of good inventory levels is not the sole task of the Operations Department, but the obligation of all the people in a company. Good inventory levels are now a measure of business competitiveness. The goal must be to increase the service level {{and at the same time}} reduce the inventory investment...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objectives}} of this thesis are {{to determine how}} and why world class manufacturing (WCM) practices are implemented, and to examine potential links between the introduction {{of these kinds of}} practices and performance measurement systems. There is theoretical and empirical evidence to suggest that WCM practices can be categorised into one or more of: total quality management (TQM), <b>just</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> manufacturing (<b>JIT)</b> and employee involvement (El). Four different WCM implementation modes are also identified in the literature. Research in the areas of management control and performance measurement suggest that in order for companies to assess the benefit of implementing WCM practices, there is an increasing necessity for them to use both financial and non-financial measures effectively. This literature thus provides the basis for the theoretical framework used in the study. The complete rubber mouldings segment of the Irish automotive component manufacturing industry is examined using a case-based design, to address both the initial research questions and the research propositions developed following literature reviews. The empirical data includes information from: preliminary interviews in academia, consultancy and government agencies; in-company interviews; plant tours; and a performance measurement questionnaire administered to three management levels in each of the five organisations studied. The findings suggest that firms can utilise both a main and secondary mode to introduce WCM practices, and that the overall implementation mode used is both affected by and affects other variables. This thesis contributes to research in a number of ways. First it provides an indepth study of WCM practices and performance measurement in an Irish context. It also develops and applies a classification of the implementation modes used to introduce WCM practices. Finally, it identifies internal and external factors associated with both the introduction of WCM practices as well as the performance measurement system utilised...|$|R
