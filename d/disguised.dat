5000|$|The play {{exploits}} {{the plot}} device of gender <b>disguise</b> and cross-dressing {{that was so}} common in English Renaissance drama — though Chapman manages to double and re-double the cross-dressing trick. Two characters cross-dress, one male, one female.

40|$|Prior {{research}} indicates that <b>disguise</b> negatively affects lineup identifications, but the mechanisms by which <b>disguise</b> works have not been explored, and different <b>disguises</b> have not been compared. In two experiments (Ns = 87 and 91) we manipulated degree of coverage by {{two different types of}} disguise: a stocking mask or sunglasses and toque (i. e., knitted hat). Participants viewed mock-crime videos followed by simultaneous or sequential lineups. <b>Disguise</b> and lineup type did not interact. In support of the view that <b>disguise</b> prevents encoding, identification accuracy generally decreased with degree of <b>disguise.</b> For the stocking <b>disguise,</b> however, full and 2 / 3 coverage led to approximately the same rate of correct identifications [...] which suggests that disrupting encoding of specific features may be as detrimental as disrupting a whole face. Accuracy was most affected by sunglasses and we discuss the role metacognitions may have played. Lineup selections decreased more slowly than accuracy as coverage by <b>disguise</b> increased, indicating witnesses are insensitive to the effect of encoding conditions on accuracy. We also explored the impact of <b>disguise</b> and lineup type on witnesses' confidence in their lineup decisions, though the results were not straightforward...|$|R
40|$|The romances {{dealt with}} in Part I were written between 1225 and {{approximately}} 1500. They are examined from individual texts to show what functions the theme of <b>disguise</b> performed within the narrative, and what literary and moral concerns they reflect in English authors. The discussion, divided under headings, examines the educative use of <b>disguise,</b> <b>disguise</b> used to determine and alter the nature of society, and episodes of individuals concealing their identity {{in order to prove}} themselves. Following sections deal with the comic use of <b>disguise,</b> with <b>disguise</b> episodes which contain social comment, with <b>disguise</b> symbolising the inner state of the individual, and with romances whose central concern is identity. Finally, there is an examination of the few examples where <b>disguise</b> features as a stock literary convention. <b>Disguise</b> in these romances, is defined as the assumption of alien dress, and also the witholding, sometimes unintentional, of identity. Part II looks at some sources of <b>disguise</b> themes in legends, popular tales and monastic writings, also at some themes having their origins in myth and ritual. This part finally deals with apparent literary conventions of <b>disguise</b> which are, however, found commonly used in contemporary social life. Part III assesses the later social and literary influence of the <b>disguise</b> theme. Chapter 6 examines its political use as gaining monarchical prestige and national unity, discusses its influence upon the changing form of the tournament, and traces its contribution {{to the development of the}} masque. The final chapter examines its use in the secular drama evolving contemporaneously with the masque, the Moral Interlude. Techniques of <b>disguise,</b> soon to become important in the Elizabethan period of high drama, were shared by writers of romance and interlude alike. Tudor dramatists, borrowing in other respects from romances, betray a similar debt in their use of the romance <b>disguise</b> theme. <p...|$|R

Aware of Indra's intention, Karnan yet donates both the items he was born with and which would make him invincible.

Enraged, he renders Karnan incapable of using the Brahmastra when most needed, and banishes him.|$|E
