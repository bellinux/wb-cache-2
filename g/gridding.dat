50|$|In the UK, {{the five}} <b>grids</b> {{operated}} thus. <b>Grid</b> 1 acted as the oscillator <b>grid</b> {{in conjunction with}} <b>grid</b> 2 which acted as its anode. <b>Grid</b> 4 accepted the incoming signal with the remaining two <b>grids,</b> 3 and 5 connected together (usually internally) which acted as screen <b>grids</b> to screen the anode, <b>grid</b> 4 and <b>grid</b> 2 from each other. Because <b>grid</b> 2 was a 'leaky' anode in that it allowed part of the modulated electron stream through, the oscillator was coupled into the mixing section of the valve. In fact, in some designs, <b>grid</b> 2 consisted of just the support rods, the actual <b>grid</b> wire itself being omitted.|$|R

40|$|Today {{basically}} two <b>grid</b> concepts {{rule the}} world: ser-vice <b>grids</b> and desktop <b>grids.</b> Service <b>grids</b> offer an infras-tructure for <b>grid</b> users, thus require notable management {{to keep the}} service running.

50|$|Grid {{models are}} {{commonly}} used to produce color-coded contour maps by averaging the regions between cells (Figure 4).

50|$|The {{single most}} {{important}} parameter that influences {{the performance of a}} anti-scatter <b>grid,</b> is the <b>grid</b> ratio. The <b>grid</b> ratio is the ratio of the height to the width of the interspaces (not the <b>grid</b> bars) in the <b>grid.</b> <b>Grid</b> ratios of 8:1, 10:1, and 12:1 are most common on radiography. A 5:1 <b>grid</b> is most common for mammography. The <b>grid</b> is essentially a one-dimensional Collimator and increasing the <b>grid</b> ration increases the degree of collimation. Higher <b>grid</b> ratios provide better scatter cleanup, but they also result in greater radiation doses to the patient.|$|R

50|$|Adaptive <b>gridding</b> allowsfor the {{concentration}} of computing power on regions of specialinterest. Mesh refinement captures the complex flow features that occur at the leading edgeof a flow, as well as locations where rapid changes in topography induce large mass and momentum fluxes.

5000|$|This dynamic {{technique}} of adapting computation precision to specific requirements has been accredited to Marsha Berger, Joseph Oliger, and Phillip Colella who developed an algorithm for dynamic <b>gridding</b> called local adaptive mesh refinement.

40|$|Scalable <b>Grid</b> Computing allows distributed, {{heterogeneous}} computational {{resources to}} be shared and coordinated. Recent standardizations by the Global <b>Grid</b> Forum (GGF), such as the Open <b>Grid</b> Service Architecture (OGSA), introduce standardized, portable, and interoperable computing to the <b>grid</b> environment by extending the web service paradigm. The extention of the web service paradigm to the <b>grid</b> computing environment is known as <b>Grid</b> Services. <b>Grid</b> services enable remote clients to access services deployed on a <b>grid</b> in a standardized format.

40|$|Computing <b>grids</b> must deliver non-trivial {{qualities of}} service, {{in terms of}} {{response}} time, security, reliability, and coordination of various <b>grid</b> resources. <b>Grid</b> meta-schedulers {{play a crucial role}} into the execution of applications, because they match <b>grid</b> application jobs with available <b>grid</b> resources. However, a typical <b>grid</b> application is not an isolated single <b>grid</b> job, but a composition of multiple <b>grid</b> jobs. Existing <b>grid</b> schedulers provide match making algorithms tailored only for independent <b>grid</b> jobs, with limited support for complex workflow submission and management. This paper presents TSM-SIM, a two-stage metascheduler simulator for <b>grid</b> workflow applications.

50|$|In {{a series}} of papers, Marsha Berger, Joseph Oliger, and Phillip Colella {{developed}} an algorithm for dynamic <b>gridding</b> called local adaptive mesh refinement. The algorithm begins with the entire computational domain covered with a coarsely resolved base-level regular Cartesian grid. As the calculation progresses, individual grid cells are tagged for refinement, using a criterion that can either be user-supplied (for example mass per cell remains constant, hence higher density regions are more highly resolved) or based on Richardson extrapolation.|$|E
50|$|The key {{difference}} between grid models and block models {{is that a}} gridded surface (e.g. a stratigraphic contact) cannot fold or wrap under itself whereas an isosurface within a block model can. Stated differently, when dealing with grids, there can only be one z-value for any given xy coordinate. On the other hand, when dealing with block models, there can only be one g-value for any given xyz coordinate. Another major difference is that <b>gridding</b> is computationally fast while block modeling can be very slow.|$|E

50|$|During {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s Gardiner {{started to go}} on regular {{fortnightly}} sketching field trips with his Box Hill TAFE colleagues Sue Shaw and Laurel McKenzie. They travelled to the You Yangs, nearby Anakie and the Brisbane Ranges, situated between Melbourne and Geelong. During this time he had stopped making woodcuts altogether as the cutting and printing became physically too demanding.

50|$|In general, {{triangular}} and hexagonal grids {{are constructed}} {{so as to}} better approach the goals of equal-area (or nearly so) plus more seamless coverage across the poles, which {{tends to be a}} problem area for square or rectangular grids since in these cases, the cell width diminishes to nothing at the pole and those cells adjacent to the pole then become 3- rather than 4-sided. Criteria for optimal discrete global <b>gridding</b> have been proposed by both Goodchild and Kimerling in which equal area cells are deemed of prime importance.|$|E
50|$|A {{wind rose}} is a graphic tool used by meteorologists {{to give a}} succinct view of how wind speed and {{direction}} are typically distributed at a particular location. Historically, wind roses were predecessors of the compass rose (found on maps), as there was no differentiation between a cardinal direction and the wind which blew from such a direction. Using a polar coordinate system of <b>gridding,</b> the frequency of winds over a time period is plotted by wind direction, with color bands showing wind speed ranges. The direction of the longest spoke shows the wind direction with the greatest frequency.|$|E
