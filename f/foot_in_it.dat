According to a local legend, King Afonso I (Afonso Henriques) exclaimed to incite his troops storming the stronghold: Coragem! Já estamos com o pé nela! (Courage! We have already set a <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>it!).</b> A more plausible hypothesis is, however, that penela is a diminutive of penha, a place selected to build a fortress on.|$|E

2500|$|Principal {{photography}} started mid-October 2011, {{and took}} place at Joss Whedon's residence in Santa Monica, California. On the choice of location, he told Studio 360, [...] "First of all, my wife built that house. And I knew from the moment I set <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> that I would want to film something there. Because it's all in one place, that place informs the mood and the feeling and {{the look of the}} picture so much, and I was really already comfortable with that". Whedon and his wife, Kai Cole, produced the film through their studio Bellwether Pictures. It was filmed entirely in a black-and-white palette over a period of 12 days, in conjunction with cinematographer Jay Hunter. Whedon shot it while on a contractual vacation from the post-production of The Avengers. The cast and crew were informed to keep the project a secret until production was finished. They wrapped their last day of filming on October 23, 2011.|$|E

2500|$|Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore (1731–1771) {{inherited}} {{from his father}} the title Baron Baltimore and the Proprietary Governorship of the Province of Maryland in 1751. Frederick Calvert wielded immense power in Maryland, which was then a colony of the Kingdom of Great Britain, administered directly by the Calverts. Frederick's inheritance coincided with a period of rising discontent in Maryland, amid growing demands by the legislative assembly {{for an end to}} his family's authoritarian rule. Frederick, however, remained aloof from the colony and never set <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> in his lifetime. He lived a life of leisure, writing verse and regarding the Province of Maryland {{as little more than a}} source of revenue. The colony was ruled through governors appointed by Calvert. His frequent travels made him difficult to contact and meant that Maryland was largely ruled without him. His personal life was extremely scandalous by the standards of the time, and this contributed to growing unrest in his colony. In 1758, his wife [...] "died from a hurt she received by a fall out of a Phaeton carriage" [...] while accompanied by her husband. Although Frederick was suspected of foul play, no charges were ever brought.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{hold that}} Ludwig {{was murdered by}} his enemies while {{attempting}} to escape from Berg. One account suggests that the king was shot. The King's personal fisherman, Jakob Lidl (1864–1933), stated, [...] "Three years after the king's death I was made {{to swear an oath}} that I would never say certain things — not to my wife, not on my deathbed, and not to any priest … The state has undertaken to look after my family if anything should happen to me in either peacetime or war." [...] Lidl kept his oath, at least orally, but left behind notes which were found after his death. According to Lidl, he had hidden behind bushes with his boat, waiting to meet the king, in order to row him out into the lake, where loyalists were waiting to help him escape. [...] "As the king stepped up to his boat and put one <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> a shot rang out from the bank, apparently killing him on the spot, for the king fell across the bow of the boat." [...] However, the autopsy report indicates no scars or wounds found on the body of the dead king; on the other hand, many years later Countess Josephine von Wrba-Kaunitz would show her afternoon tea guests a grey Loden coat with two bullet holes in the back, asserting it was the one Ludwig was wearing. Another theory suggests that Ludwig died of natural causes (such as a heart attack or stroke) brought on by the cool water (12°C) of the lake during an escape attempt.|$|E
2500|$|His down-to-earth manner was {{attested to}} by a White House butler who {{recalled}} that, {{on a visit}} in 1979, Philip had engaged him and a fellow butler in a conversation, and poured them drinks. As well as a reputation for bluntness and plain speaking, Philip is noted for occasionally making observations and jokes that have been construed as either funny, or as gaffes: awkward, [...] politically incorrect or even offensive, but sometimes perceived as stereotypical of someone of his age and background. In {{an address to the}} General Dental Council in 1960, he jokingly coined a new word for his blunders: [...] "Dontopedalogy  is  the science of opening your mouth and putting your <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> a science which I have practised for a good many years." [...] Later in life he suggested his comments {{may have contributed to the}} perception that he is [...] "a cantankerous old sod". The historian David Starkey has described him as a kind of [...] "HRH Victor Meldrew". For example, in May 1999 British newspapers accused Philip of insulting deaf children at a pop concert in Wales by saying, [...] "No wonder you are deaf listening to this row." [...] Later Philip wrote, [...] "The story is largely invention. It so happens that my mother was quite seriously deaf and I have been Patron of the Royal National Institute for the Deaf for ages, so it's hardly likely that I would do any such thing." [...] When he and the Queen met Stephen Menary, an army cadet blinded by an IRA bomb, and the Queen enquired how much sight he retained, Philip quipped: [...] "Not a lot, judging by the tie he's wearing". Menary later said: [...] "I think he just tries to put people at ease by trying to make a joke. I certainly didn't take any offence." [...] During a state visit to the People's Republic of China in 1986, in a private conversation with British students from Xi'an's North West University, Philip joked, [...] "If you stay here much longer, you'll go slit-eyed." [...] The British press reported on the remark as indicative of racial intolerance, but the Chinese authorities were reportedly unconcerned. Chinese students studying in the UK, an official explained, were often told in jest not to stay away too long, lest they go [...] "round-eyed". His comment had no effect on Sino-British relations, but it shaped his own reputation.|$|E
