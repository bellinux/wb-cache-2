5|$|White's father, Hampshire County Clerk of Court John Baker White, {{learned of}} the {{advancement}} of Union Army forces on Romney, and became concerned {{for the safety of}} the county's records.

In fall 1864, the county's record books were rescued by White and his company as Union Army troops were in the process of destroying them.
