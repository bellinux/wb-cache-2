5|$|Developed {{over many}} centuries, Kraków {{provides}} a showcase setting for many historic styles of architecture. As the city expanded, so too did the architectural achievements of its builders. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> {{reason that the}} variations in style and urban planning are so easily recognisable.|$|E
5|$|A common idea in {{the comics}} is that Bruce saw a Zorro film with his parents before they were murdered. Nolan {{explained}} that by ignoring that idea – which he stated is not found in Batman's first appearances – it {{emphasized the importance of}} bats to Bruce and that becoming a superhero is a wholly original idea on his part. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason Nolan believes other DC characters do not exist in the universe of his film; otherwise, Wayne's reasons for taking up costumed vigilantism would have been very different.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe saliceticola {{grows in}} {{mycorrhizal}} association with willow trees, and it <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> that {{the species is}} named. However, particular species favoured by the fungus are unclear and may include beech and alder taxa. The mushrooms grow from the ground, often among mosses or detritus. I.saliceticola was first described in 2009, and within the genus Inocybe, the species {{is a part of}} the section Marginatae. The species has been recorded in Finland and Sweden and is relatively common in some areas.|$|E

5|$|It is {{important}} for forensic anthropologists {{to take into account}} all available markers in the determination of sex due to the differences that can occur between individuals of the same sex. For example, it is possible that a female may have a slightly more narrow than normal pubic arch. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that anthropologists usually classify sex as one of five possibilities: male, may be male, indeterminate, may be female, or female. In addition, forensic anthropologists are generally unable to make a sex determination unless the individual was an adult at the time of death. The sexual dimorphisms present in the skeleton begin to occur during puberty and are not fully pronounced until after sexual maturation.|$|E
5|$|The {{small size}} of the airport is perhaps best {{illustrated}} {{with the fact that}} a Boeing 757 cannot taxi past another aircraft to parking positions. As a result, controllers are responsible not only for ensuring that valuable space is utilised, but also ensuring that other aircraft are kept circling until larger aircraft are parked. Despite these limitations, the airport successfully handles ten to twenty times more traffic than airports of a comparable size. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that plans to relocate the airport are so important in the short-term scale. In 2006, a NIS 5.5 million renovation programme of Eilat Airport's terminal and runway was undertaken, designed to sustain the airport until it is replaced in the near future.|$|E

25|$|By 1840, {{the area}} of Nova Scotia Gardens had {{degenerated}} into a notorious slum. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that the philanthropist, Angela Burdett-Coutts purchased the land, and, after the leases expired, established Columbia Market in 1869.|$|E
25|$|The term Implementer was the self-given name of {{the creators}} of the text {{adventure}} series Zork. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that game designers and programmers {{can be referred to}} as an Implementer (video games), often shortened to Imp, rather than a writer.|$|E
25|$|Noseclips {{can prevent}} water from {{getting in the}} nose. However, this is {{generally}} only used for synchronised swimming. Using noseclips in competitive swimming can cause a disadvantage to most swimmers. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that noseclips are only used for synchronised swimming and recreational swimming.|$|E

25|$|Despite their effectiveness, non-water agents do not {{cleanse the}} hands of organic material, but simply {{disinfect}} them. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water at preventing the spread of many pathogens, since the pathogens still remain on the hands.|$|E
25|$|A Catechumen (from Latin catechumenus, Greek κατηχουμενος , instructed) is one {{receiving}} {{instruction in}} {{the principles of the}} Christian religion with a view to baptism. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that those who are already validly baptized in another Christian Faith are not known as Catechumens, but rather Candidates.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{independence}} of local communities, Jewish ethnicities, even when they circumscribe differences in liturgy, language, cuisine and other cultural accoutrements, are more often a reflection of geographic and historical isolation from other communities. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that communities are referred to by referencing the historical region in which the community cohered when discussing their practices, regardless of where those practices are found today.|$|E

25|$|The Catholic Church and {{the ancient}} Christian Churches see priestly {{ordination}} as a sacrament dedicating the person ordained to a permanent relationship of service, and, like Baptism and Confirmation, having an ontological effect on the person. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that a person may be ordained {{to each of the}} three orders only once. They also consider that ordination can be conferred only on males.|$|E
25|$|Go Seigen {{began his}} {{rise to the}} top of {{professional}} go world early. By the time he was 18 he was already a top-flight player belonging to a very small elite. In 1933, along with his great friend Kitani Minoru, Go Seigen developed and popularized the Shinfuseki that broke away from the traditional opening patterns. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> very important contribution that Go Seigen and Kitani Minoru are recognized as the fathers of modern go.|$|E
25|$|Intravenous sodium {{bicarbonate}} is an aqueous solution that is sometimes used for cases of acidosis, or when insufficient sodium or bicarbonate ions {{are in the}} blood. In cases of respiratory acidosis, the infused bicarbonate ion drives the carbonic acid/bicarbonate buffer of plasma to the left and, thus, raises the pH. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that {{sodium bicarbonate}} is used in medically supervised cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Infusion of bicarbonate is indicated only when the blood pH is markedly (<7.1–7.0) low.|$|E

25|$|Kula {{exchange}} {{is the only}} way for an individual to achieve local prestige without local political action. But this prestige is fleeting and does not transform into permanent differences in rank because women's participation is minor and Kula shells lack cosmological authentication. It is not Kula shells but women's cloth wealth that is connected with matrilineal ancestors. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that women retain high prestige and authority despite the fame of male Kula exchange players.|$|E
25|$|While {{it works}} in {{preventing}} speech, {{a person who has}} been stuff gagged can easily spit it out by pushing it with his/her tongue. However, it <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that the stuff gag is one of the safest gags to use during self bondage, as the person with his/her hands tied can still spit the gag out if he/she feels any kind of discomfort. However, the risks of asphyxiation and choking are still present for someone who is not careful.|$|E
25|$|The most {{accurate}} figures usually {{belong to the}} air arm fighting over its own territory, where many wrecks can be located, and even identified, and where shot down enemy are either killed or captured. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> reason that at least 76 of the 80 aircraft credited to Manfred von Richthofen can be tied to known British losses—the German Jagdstaffeln flew defensively, on their own side of the lines, {{in part due to}} General Hugh Trenchard's policy of offensive patrol.|$|E
