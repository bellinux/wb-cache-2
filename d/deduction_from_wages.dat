As soon as it became clear that excessive <b>deductions</b> <b>from</b> <b>wages</b> as well as payments by workers for materials used in the work were not illegal, and that deductions or payments by way of compensation to employers or by way of discipline might legally (with the single exception of fines for lateness for women and children, regulated by the Employers and Workmen Act 1875) even exceed the degree of loss, hindrance or damage to the employer, it also came clearly into view that further legislation was desirable to extend the principles {{at the root of the}} Truck Acts.

40|$|AbstractThe {{price is}} the decisive {{parameter}} {{in evaluating the}} competition {{for the implementation of}} construction works. It's clear and correct determination is an important principle of project management and the basis for success of construction projects. The method of determining the price of the construction work with the aid of so-called ‘calculation formula’ has been for many decades commonly used in Czech construction industry as a basic tool for pricing. It is based on the situation when the person performing the construction work is an employee of the contractor (within the meaning of the Labour Code). All the items of the calculation formula of particular construction work can be derived from the standards used by a company, costs known in advance (contractual <b>wages,</b> statutory <b>deductions</b> <b>from</b> <b>wages,</b> machinery work, overhead costs) and the intended profit. The situation is different in case of a natural person who works on his/her own, within the meaning of The Trade Licensing Act. Apart from overall costs, part of his/her “wage” (remuneration) must cover the cost of living. In this article, the authors use the principle of retrograde calculation and propose a method whereby a self-employed person is also able to accurately calculate the cost of a construction work. Part of the calculation is also the determination of net income after subtracting all statutory deductions. In the future, the use of the suggested calculation with provability of sub-items can become a tool for increasing competitiveness of the self-employed...|$|R

50|$|Payroll {{taxes are}} taxes imposed on {{employers}} or employees, {{and are usually}} calculated {{as a percentage of}} the salaries that employers pay their staff. Payroll taxes generally fall into two categories: <b>deductions</b> <b>from</b> an employee’s <b>wages,</b> and taxes paid by the employer based on the employee's wages. The first kind are taxes that employers are required to withhold <b>from</b> employees' <b>wages,</b> also known as withholding tax, pay-as-you-earn tax (PAYE), or pay-as-you-go tax (PAYG) and often covering advance payment of income tax, social security contributions, and various insurances (e.g., unemployment and disability). The second kind is a tax that is paid from the employer's own funds and that is directly related to employing a worker. These can consist of fixed charges or be proportionally linked to an employee's pay. The charges paid by the employer usually cover the employer's funding of the social security system, and other insurance programs. The economic burden of the payroll tax falls almost entirely on the worker, regardless of whether the tax is remitted by the employer or the employee, as the employers’ share of payroll taxes is passed on to employees in the form of lower wages than would otherwise be paid.|$|R

50|$|The {{debate on}} Ashley's motion was {{markedly}} non-partisan. Responding Graham said that, although {{the problem was}} a national one, the government would for the moment bring forward measures only for the two areas of education {{in which the state}} already had some involvement; the education of workhouse children and the education of factory children. The measures he announced related to England and Wales; Scotland had an established system of parochial schools run by its established church, with little controversy, since in Scotland there was no dissent on doctrine, only on questions of discipline. To allow for the provision of efficient schools where voluntary efforts had failed, the 'education clauses' of his Factory Education Bill allowed for trust schools to be set up. These would be initiated by voluntary effort, and - as previously for efficient voluntary schools - a third of capital costs could be supplied by a government grant; Graham proposed that in addition another third could be met by a government loan to be repaid from the poor rates. The running costs of such a school would be met by the <b>deductions</b> <b>from</b> children's <b>wages</b> allowed by the 1833 Act, supplemented by a charge on the poor rates. The trustees would be the Anglican parish priest and two of his churchwardens and four trustees (of whom two should preferably be mill-owners) nominated by the magistrates. The default religious education in these schools would be Anglican, but parents would be allowed to opt their children out of anything specifically Anglican; if the opt-out was exercised, religious education would be as in a British School. Once a trust school was open in a factory district, factory children in that district would have to provide a certificate that they were being educated at it or at some other school certified as 'efficient'.|$|R

Indirect protection to workers {{is no doubt in}} many cases afforded in organized industries by the action of the Conseils de Prud'hommes. Belgium. - In 1848 in Belgium the Commission on Labour proposed legislation to limit, as in France, the hours of labour for adults, but this proposal was never passed. Belgian regulation of labour in industry remains essentially, in harmony with its earliest beginnings in 1863 and onwards, a series of specialized provisions to meet particular risks of individual trades, and did not, until 1889, give any adherence to a common principle of limitation of hours and times of labour for [...] " [...] protected [...] " [...] persons. This was in the law of 13 December 1889, which applies to mines, quarries, factories, workshops classed as unhealthy, wharves and docks, transports. As in France, industrial establishments having a charitable or philanthropic or educational character are included. The persons protected are girls and women under 21 years, and boys under 16; and women over 21 only find a place in the law through the prohibition of their employment within four weeks after childbirth. As the hours of labour of adult women remain ordinarily unlimited by law, so are the hours of boys from 16 to 21. The law of Sunday rest dated 17 July 1905, however, applies to labour generally in all industrial and commercial undertakings except transport and fisheries, with certain regulated exceptions for (a) cases of breakdown or urgency due to force majeure, (b) certain repairs and cleaning, (c) [...] perishable materials, (d) retail food supply. Young workers are excluded from the exceptions. The absolute prohibitions of employment are: for children under 12 years in any industry, manufacturing or mining or transport, and for women and girls under 21 years below the surface in working of mines. Boys under. 16 years and women and girls under 21 years may in general not be employed before 5 A.M. or after 9 P.M., and one day in the seven is to be set apart for rest from employment; to these rules exception may be made either by royal decree for classes or groups of processes, or by local authorities in exceptional cases. The exceptions may be applied, generally, only to workers over 14 years, but in mines, by royal decree, boys over 12 years may be employed from 4 A.M. The law of 1889 fixes only a maximum of 12 hours of effective work, to be interrupted by pauses for rest of not less than 12 hours, empowering the king by decree to formulate more precise limits suited to the special circumstances of individual industries. Royal decrees have accordingly laid down the conditions for many groups, including textile trades, manufacture of paper, pottery, glass, clothing, mines, quarries, engineering and printing works. In some the daily limit is 10 hours, but in more 102 or I I hours. In a few exceptionally unhealthy trades, such as the manufacture of lucifer matches, vulcanization of india-rubber by means of carbcn bi-sulphide, the age of exclusion from employment has been raised, and in the last-named process hours have been reduced to 5, broken into two spells of 21. hours each.|$|R
