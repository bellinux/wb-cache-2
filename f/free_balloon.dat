He abandoned the Air Corps upon receiving his desired assignment as a gunnery instructor at the field artillery school at Fort Sill.

25|$|On 2 September 1925, Shenandoah {{departed}} Lakehurst on {{a promotional}} {{flight to the}} Midwest that would include flyovers of 40 cities and visits to state fairs. Testing of a new mooring mast at Dearborn, Michigan, {{was included in the}} schedule. While passing through an area of thunderstorms and turbulence over Ohio early in the morning of 3 September, during its 57th flight, the airship was caught in a violent updraft that carried it beyond the pressure limits of its gas bags. It was torn apart in the turbulence and crashed in several pieces near Caldwell, Ohio. Fourteen crew members, including Commander Zachary Lansdowne, were killed. This included every member of the crew of the control cabin (except for Lieutenant Anderson, who escaped before it detached from the ship); two men who fell through holes in the hull; and several mechanics who fell with the engines. There were twenty-nine survivors, who succeeded in riding three sections of the airship to earth. The largest group was eighteen men who made it out of the stern after it rolled into a valley. Four others survived a crash landing of the central section. The remaining seven were in the bow section which Commander (later Vice Admiral) Charles E. Rosendahl navigated as a <b>free</b> <b>balloon.</b> In this group was Anderson who—until he was roped in by the others—straddled the catwalk over a hole.|$|E

The Hindenburg disaster is frequently cited {{as an example of}} the hydrogen safety risks posed by hydrogen. The high cost of helium (compared to hydrogen) has led researchers to re-investigate the safety issues of using hydrogen as a lift gas: with good engineering and good handling practices, the risks can be significantly reduced.|$|R

50|$|Although a <b>free</b> <b>balloon</b> travels at {{the speed}} of the wind, it is {{travelling}} with the wind so to a passenger the air feels calm and windless.

40|$|Measurements of the {{electrical}} {{characteristics of the}} atmosphere above the surface have been made for over 200 years, {{from a variety of}} different platforms, including kites, balloons, rockets and aircraft. From these measurements, {{a great deal of information}} about {{the electrical}} characteristics of the atmosphere has been gained, assisting our understanding of the global atmospheric electric circuit, thunderstorm electrification and lightning generation mechanisms, discovery of transient luminous events above thunderstorms, and many other electrical phenomena. This paper surveys the history of atmospheric electrical measurements aloft, from the earliest manned balloon ascents to current day observations with <b>free</b> <b>balloons</b> and aircraft. Measurements of atmospheric electrical parameters in a range of meteorological conditions are described, including clear air conditions, polluted conditions, non-thunderstorm clouds, and thunderstorm clouds, spanning a range of atmospheric conditions, from fair weather, to the most electrically active. ...|$|R

40|$|Electroscope and Geiger counter {{observations}} {{have been}} taken with <b>free</b> <b>balloons</b> at geomagnetic latitudes of 3 °, 17 °, and 25 °N.

(2) Vertical coincidence measurements give rise to markedly different values for the relative amounts of incident energy at various latitudes, {{as compared with the}} electroscope or single counter data. (3) Within the experimental error, no difference was obtained between the vertical coincidence curves at 3 ° and 17 °, and thus no new energy lies in the primary energy spectrum between the limits of 17 and 15 Bev.
