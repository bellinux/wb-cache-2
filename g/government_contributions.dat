25|$|The rest of {{the costs}} of these {{highways}} are borne by general fund receipts, bond issues, designated property taxes, and other taxes. The federal contribution comes overwhelmingly from motor vehicle and fuel taxes (93.5percent in 2007), and it makes up about 60percent of the contributions by the states. However, any local <b>government</b> <b>contributions</b> are overwhelmingly from sources besides user fees. The portion of the user fees spent on highways themselves covers about 57percent of their costs, with about one-sixth of the user fees being sent to other programs, including the mass transit systems in large cities. Some large sections of Interstate Highways that were planned or constructed before 1956 are still operated as toll roads. Others have had their construction bonds paid off and they have become toll-free, such as in Connecticut (I‑95), Maryland (I‑95), Virginia (I‑95), and Kentucky (I‑65).|$|E

He wrote that the Russian leadership had taken the decisions that caused the Russo-Georgian war between September 1999 and June 2003. After the appointment of Vladimir Putin in August 1999 as Prime minister, the Russian government changed its attitude towards Georgia. Whatever Saakashvili's <b>government</b> <b>contributions</b> to {{the deterioration of the}} Russia-Georgia relations, neither he or his colleagues held positions in the Georgian government before November 2003.

By supplying South Ossetia with heavy military equipment in February 2003, the Russian government chose the military solution to the conflict with Georgia. Mostly the Russian-Abkhaz-South Ossetian coalition made the first moves, to which Georgians responded.

In exchange for those conditions, he would get City Council to change its position. On February 12, 1981, City Council approved a motion stating it was [...] "not unalterably opposed to a limited STOL operation" [...] 14–9. Council's conditions on the service included a ban on jets; no runway expansion; no bridge or tunnel to the airport; and careful regulation on flight paths, takeoffs and landings would be imposed.
