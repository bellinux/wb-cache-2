25|$|For Fitzpatrick, {{the key to}} {{establishing}} financially viable models for university presses and modes of scholarly publishing more generally is the reconceptualization of the university’s mission. Universities must recognize that their mission is, {{in addition to the}} production of knowledge, the communication of knowledge. Fitzpatrick conceptualizes scholarship as an ongoing conversation between scholars that can only continue if participants have the means to contribute to it. Publishing and disseminating information via the university press is one possible mode of communication. This reconceptualization of the university’s mission <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>and</b> <b>parcel</b> to the restructuring of its press’s functioning. If the university is reimagined as a center of communication, rather than principally as a credential-bestowing organization, its central mission becomes the production and dissemination of scholarly work. In this rethinking, the press has a future as the knowledge-disseminating organ of the university. For this to happen, the press must be integrated within the university and be provided sufficient funding so that its mission is not financially based but, rather, aligns with that of the university.|$|E

500|$|Until recently, {{the full}} panoply of {{potential}} federal resources {{had not been}} brought to bear effectively on corruption schemes {{at the state and}} local level. These schemes are at least as corrosive of the governmental process as corruption at the federal level. From the time of Tammany Hall this country has been painfully aware of the existence of corrupt practices in many of our metropolitan areas, and of the [...] "machines" [...] and [...] "rings" [...] which siphon off millions of dollars from public treasuries for private gain. Most state and local prosecutors, beset by inadequate resources and the overwhelming demands of a rising rate of street crime, are simply unable to deal with this type of corruption.

The same declarations are being used for both motions and the motion {{appears to be an}} alternative pleading to the previous motion. Both are asking for an experimental procedure." [...] The following day, Greer denied the first motion as well, citing that an affiant doctor for Michael cautioned that fMRI was an experimental procedure that should be conducted in an academic setting, because Schiavo had already undergone swallowing tests and failed, and because VitalStim had only been performed on patients who were not in a PVS. Greer noted that [...] "most of the doctor affidavits submitted are based on their understanding of Schiavo's condition from news reports or video clips they have seen. Many are obviously not aware of the medical exams undertaken for the 2002 trial." ...|$|E

Two years since, Dr. Wace said that he believed the story as it stands; and consequently he holds, as a part of divine revelation, that the spiritual world comprises devils, who, under certain circumstances, may enter men and be transferred from them to four-footed beasts.
