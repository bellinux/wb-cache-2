5|$|I {{should say}} I {{wanted to write}} poetry in the {{beginning}} because I {{had fallen in love}} with words. The first poems I knew were nursery rhymes and before I could read them for myself <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to love the words of them. The words alone. What the words stood for was of a very secondary importance... I fell in love, that is the only expression I can think of, at once, and am still at the mercy of words, though sometimes now, knowing a little of their behaviour very well, I think I can influence them slightly and have even learned to beat them now and then, which they appear to enjoy. I tumbled for words at once. And, when I began to read the nursery rhymes for myself, and, later, to read other verses and ballads, I knew that I had discovered the most important things, to me, that could be ever.|$|E

Through the cession of Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria (the Treaty of Craiova) in early September, Greater Romania in the shape it had at the end of World War <b>I,</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to an end.|$|E
25|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, and when food is locally abundant, the ducks may congregate in small flocks, sometimes {{of up to}} about a hundred. Murphy noted:On December 20th, 1912, I photographed a pair of teals feeding in a trickle of water which ran through tall tussock grass from the melting edge of a glacier. The birds were well hidden by the screen of grass, and I almost stumbled over them before seeing them. They appeared quite unconcerned, however, and continued prodding about in the mud. When <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> within two steps of them, they raised their heads and waddled farther off among the hummocks, from where they peered out through drooping grass. All but the bright eyes and yellow bills blended completely with the surroundings. Matthews has well said that their pattern fits in so thoroughly with the environment that it is sometimes only {{the movement of the}} conspicuous yellow bill that calls one’s attention to their presence. Many observers have noted the birds’ preference to lose themselves in the grass when they are approached, rather than to seek safety in the air, and it is likely that before the arrival of men and guns at South Georgia they used their wings only for relatively short and infrequent flights.|$|E

500|$|Gandhi {{credited}} Shrimad Rajchandra, a {{poet and}} Jain philosopher, as his influential counsellor. In Modern Review, June 1930, Gandhi wrote about their first encounter in 1891 at Dr. P.J. Mehta's residence in Bombay. Gandhi exchanged letters with Rajchandra {{when he was in}} South Africa, referring to him as Kavi (literally, [...] "poet"). In 1930, Gandhi wrote, [...] "Such was the man who captivated my heart in religious matters as no other man ever has till now." [...] 'I have said elsewhere that in moulding my inner life Tolstoy and Ruskin vied with Kavi. But Kavi's influence was undoubtedly deeper if only because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> in closest personal touch with him.' ...|$|E
500|$|When, {{several years}} after its passage, the 1873 law became a {{political}} issue, some {{of those involved in}} enacting it, including Sherman and Linderman, stated that there had been no intent to end bimetallism in the elimination of the authority for private citizens to have silver bullion coined into dollars. They argued that the 1853 legislation had ended the practice of having bullion struck into smaller-denomination coins; the 1873 act simply rectified an omission and eliminated a coin with a low mintage that did not circulate. They were not always consistent in their denials: Boutwell wrote in his memoirs that [...] "in 1873 <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to believe that it was wise for every nation to recognize, establish, and maintain the gold standard... hence it was that I determined to abandon the idea of a double [...] standard.|$|E
500|$|During his procrastinations with Koussevitzky, Sibelius {{continued}} {{to work on the}} symphony. In 1931 he again spent time in Berlin, writing to Aino in May 1931 that [...] "the symphony is advancing with rapid strides". Progress was interrupted by illness, but {{towards the end of the}} year Sibelius was confidently asserting that [...] "I am writing my eighth symphony and I am full of youth. How can this be explained?" [...] In May 1933, as he {{continued to}} deny Koussevitzky, Sibelius wrote in his diary that he was deeply immersed in composition: [...] "It is as if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> home... I'm taking everything in another way, more deeply. A gypsy within me. Romantic." [...] Later that summer he informed a journalist that his new symphony was nearly complete: [...] "It will be the reckoning of my whole existence – sixty-eight years. It will probably be my last. Eight symphonies and a hundred songs. It has to be enough." ...|$|E

500|$|Lancashire's final role {{under her}} ITV {{contract}} was Gertrude Morel in {{an adaptation of}} D.H. Lawrence's 1913 novel Sons and Lovers, airing in January 2003. The portrayal–her first of a mother with adult children– followed Gertrude's transformation from a young bride into a fifty-something woman ravaged by her life experiences of poverty and domestic abuse. Lancashire re-read the novel several times prior to filming, and identified with the themes of filial and marital relationships she {{had been unable to}} appreciate as a GCSE student. The miniseries gave her a sense of conviction in her career path, stating ahead of the broadcast in 2002: [...] "whatever the reason I do what I do, I felt <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to a point where I could stop searching after this". Reviewing the serial Paul Hoggart of The Times wrote that Lancashire [...] "steals the show" [...] with a [...] "performance of immense subtlety and quiet strength, proof, if we still needed it, that she has matured into a terrific actress." [...] Conversely Andrew Billen, writing in New Statesman, wrote that [...] "Sarah Lancashire was no revelation at all", purely because she had [...] "long since proved herself a formidable actress".|$|E
500|$|Beckinsale rose to fame in 2001 with {{a leading}} role in the war film Pearl Harbor as a nurse torn between two pilots, played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett. She was drawn to the project by the script: [...] "It's so unusual these days to read a script that has those old-fashioned values to it. Not morals, but movie values. It's a big, {{sweeping}} epic....You just never get the chance to do that." [...] Director Michael Bay initially had doubts about casting the actress: [...] "I wasn't sure about her at first...she wore black leather trousers in her screen test and I thought she was a little nasty...it was easy to think of this woman as a slut." [...] He eventually decided to hire her because she wasn't [...] "too beautiful. Women feel disturbed when they see someone’s too pretty." [...] He asked her to lose weight during filming. In a 2004 interview, the actress noted that his comments were [...] "upsetting" [...] and said she wore leather trousers because [...] "it was snowing out. It wasn't exactly like I had my nipple rings in." [...] She felt grateful that she had not had to deal with such criticism at a younger age: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> on to a movie set at [...] age and someone had said, 'You're a bit funny-looking, can you go on a diet?'—I might have jumped off a building. I just didn't have the confidence to put that into perspective at the time." [...] However, speaking in 2011, she said she was [...] "very fond" [...] of Bay. Pearl Harbor received negative reviews. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised [...] "the avid eyed, ruby lipped Kate Beckinsale, the rare actress whose intelligence gives her a sensual bloom; she's like Parker Posey without irony." [...] A.O.Scott of The New York Times noted that [...] "Mr.Affleck and Ms.Beckinsale do what they can with their lines, and glow with the satiny shine of real movie stars." [...] However, Mike Clark of USA Today felt that the [...] "usually appealing Kate Beckinsale" [...] is [...] "inexplicably submerged—like her hospital colleagues—under heaps of tarty makeup that even actresses of the era didn't wear." [...] The film was a commercial success, grossing $449 million worldwide.|$|E

2500|$|Informed {{about his}} death, M.N. Roy wrote: [...] "I could {{not forget the}} {{injunction}} of the only man I ever obeyed almost blindly JatinDa's heroic death [...] must be avenged. Only a year had passed since then. But in the meantime <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to realise that I admired JatinDa because he personified, perhaps without himself knowing it, the best of mankind. The corollary to that realisation was that Jatinda's death would be avenged if I worked for the ideal of establishing a social order in which the best in man could be manifest." ...|$|E

So I {{decided to make a}} real treasure, of gold, bury it in the ground and paint real puzzles to lead people to it.

Premiji's writings gradually made me realise that I had the wrong notion. This was the foremost reason for me to be attracted towards him.|$|E
2500|$|The {{exhibition}} attracted large attendances and interest, {{and then}} Allen lectured on the works during its tour. La Revue Moderne, a French modern art journal, profiled her in 1931. The New York Times called {{her work in}} the Australian Art exhibition [...] "arrestingly modern" [...] — this was {{in contrast to the}} conservative works of other Australian artists. In a later interview with The Advertiser, on 17 June 1936, Allen mentioned all the art work exhibited had non-Australian scenery and had titles such as [...] "Landscape in Spain" [...] and [...] "Bosky Dells in Surrey". She elaborated, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> upon as much as a single kangaroo I would have hailed it with delight".|$|E
2500|$|Later this {{affinity}} for Great Britain prompted Buechner to make frequent sojourns and {{visits to the}} United Kingdom. [...] He cultivated profound, enduring, and mutually supportive relationships with prominent Britons. [...] He spoke regularly at Westminster Abbey and Salisbury and was friendly with former deans, The Very Rev. Michael Mayne (Westminster) and The Very Rev. Hugh Dickinson (Salisbury). In fact, his most recent collection, The Yellow Leaves, was dedicated {{to the memory of}} Michael Mayne and, with love, to his wife Allison. [...] In that work, Buechner expresses [...] "the feeling that from the beginning I had had in England that in some sense <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> home, the feeling I had always had, in Westminster Abbey especially, that all the dead past enshrined there was far from dead in me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ellison was {{recalled}} to the squad, but {{omitted from}} the XI for the fourth Test at Old Trafford, [...] "fortunately", in his opinion: [...] "I say [...] fortunately because I never liked bowling at Old Trafford; {{it was more of}} a [...] spinner's wicket." [...] Only 24 wickets fell in the match, and both Jonathan Agnew and Paul Allott, rivals for a fast-bowling place, went wicketless. In the event, both Agnew and Allot were {{omitted from the}} next XI and Ellison was recalled for the fifth test. He remembers: [...] "When we got to Edgbaston I was advised not to play by Bernard Thomas (England physio) as I had a heavy cold. He thought I would not get through five days.

She later wrote in her autobiography The Million Dollar Mermaid that [...] "he was smart, handsome, dependable...and dull. I respected his intelligence, and his dedication to a future career in medicine. He loved me, or so he said, and even asked me to marry him." [...] They were married in the San Francisco suburb of Los Altos on June 27, 1940. On their split she said [...] "I found, much to my relief, that all I needed for my emotional and personal security was my own resolve and determination. I didn't need a marriage and a ring. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> to realize all too quickly that Leonard Kovner {{was not a man}} I could ever really love."

2500|$|Chakraverti's public {{declaration}} {{that she was}} a [...] witch came at a time, when India still considered the word [...] "witch", taboo. Author Kumkum Bhandari said that [...] "Ipsita was a pioneer. Remember, call someone a 'witch' and you could be in for slander. Legally. But she was easily accepted. Partly because of her packaging and presentation—she is elegant, articulate and poised. People listen when she speaks. [...] Life and magic course through and around her. Being a witch is about ripping away layers of social conditioning, gender limitations and protective shields. It is, in a sense about moving towards being the complete and total woman. There is intensity, conviction and passion in the way Ipsita talks about witchcraft, or Wicca—the Craft of the Wise—and its relevance throughout history." [...] Chakraverti also observes that [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>come</b> from a different rung of society, or was illiterate, the reaction wouldn't be the same. I have observed that it is always the person they will accept, and then the word Wicca. Witches are not born, they are made. Or perhaps they sculpt themselves." [...] According to her, every strong woman can be considered a witch. [...] "A witch is the total woman. Strong daring women who have dared to live their own life, whatever it is. Jacqueline Kennedy, Indira Gandhi, Marilyn Monroe, Madonna, Namita Gokhale, Kiran Bedi—all of them could count as witches." [...] Chakraverti has argued that Wicca is the first feminist movement in history and the oldest women-oriented branch of learning.|$|E
