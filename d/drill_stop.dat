40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo test a {{modified}} otologic drill under different drilling conditions {{for its ability}} to identify <b>drilling</b> faults and <b>stop</b> <b>drilling.</b> MethodsBased on force analysis and previous works, anotologic drill was modified and equipped with three sensors. Under various conditions, the drill was used to simulate three drilling faults and normal drilling, and signals from the drill were analyzed to extract the characteristic signal. A multi–sensor information fusion system and a stop program were designed to recognize <b>drilling</b> faults and <b>stop</b> <b>drilling.</b> ResultsSignals from each sensor changed consistently in response to drilling condition changes, with high repeatability and regularity. The average identification rate was 72. 625 %, 68. 575 %, 70. 5 % and 81. 3 % respectively for the three simulated drilling faults and normal <b>drilling.</b> The <b>stop</b> program <b>stopped</b> <b>drilling</b> in 0. 2 ~ 0. 3 seconds when a drilling faults was detected. ConclusionsThis study shows that the forces acting on the drill bit change predictably in the three simulated drilling conditions; that using suitable BP neural networks, the drilling faults can be reliably identified, and that a stop program based upon characteristic signal recognition can <b>stop</b> <b>drilling</b> quickly upon detecting drilling faults. This lays a foundation for development of a system capable of predicting drilling faults and automatic drill control. Further studies are being undertaken for practical application of such a system...|$|R
30|$|The gel {{strength}} Gel 0 / 10 (initial 0  s/ 10  min) is the shear stress of drilling mud that is measured at low shear rate after the drilling mud is static {{for a certain}} period of time.

50|$|Fatigue cracks {{that have}} begun to {{propagate}} can sometimes be <b>stopped</b> by <b>drilling</b> holes, called <b>drill</b> <b>stops,</b> {{in the path of}} the fatigue crack. This is not recommended as a general practice because the hole represents a stress concentration factor which depends on the size of the hole and geometry, though the hole is typically less of a stress concentration than the removed tip of the crack. The possibility remains of a new crack starting in the side of the hole. It is always far better to replace the cracked part entirely.|$|R
40|$|Many {{failures}} in engineering applications or machine components {{have been caused}} by a crack initiated from points at which stress was concentrated. As the stress concentration level is higher than a critical value, continuous crack-growth results in failure in the machine components. Crack initiation behavior has been evaluated to prevent an early failure of machine equipment. Delaying the crack initiation is important for the maintenance of machine elements {{as well as for the}} detection of crack initiation. Hence, the main objective of this study is to investigate the delay of crack using <b>stop</b> <b>drilled</b> holes. The investigation was based on the diameter of the <b>stop</b> <b>drilled</b> holes and the arrangement of the <b>stop</b> <b>drilled</b> holes. Both experiment and finite element analysis were done in order to validate the result. The experiment was carried out by using tensile test to obtain maximum applied load to the specimen while the finite element analysis was analyzed by using ALGOR V 22 software to obtain the stress of the specimen. The experimental results and the finite element analysis results show that the crack initiation life of the specimen was longer when the diameter of the <b>stop</b> <b>drilled</b> holes increased. The further the location of the <b>stop</b> <b>drilled</b> holes with the slits location, the longer crack initiation life of the specimen. Thus, the influence of the <b>stop</b> <b>drilled</b> holes on the crack initiation life has been evaluated...|$|R

To enhance the fatigue life of a cracked plate the process of <b>stop</b> <b>drilling</b> the crack tips, cold expanding the resulting holes and inserting interference-fit steel plugs has dramatically increased fatigue resistance.

40|$|In {{the last}} years the cost for rig rental has become very high. To reduce total cost it has been {{necessary}} to increase the cost efficiency when drilling to improve profit. One way to improve profit {{is to reduce the}} nonproductive time related to faults and failures which could occur during drilling. In addition many of the oil fields in the north sea are starting tail production where the pressure window are small which means that managed pressure drilling or under balanced drilling must be used. This thesis combines fault tolerant control and managed pressure drilling to see if it is feasible to continue drilling with fault in the system. The fault tolerant control system is based on model matching. Simulation is done of choke blocked in closed position such that back pressure pump is used to control the bottom hole pressure. Simulation is done with MATLAB. This to see if it is possible to use back pressure pump if the choke is blocked to such that drilling can proceed even if there is a choke failure which normally would result <b>drilling</b> <b>stop.</b> A simple hydraulic model is used in the simulation. The model does not apply actuator dynamics. The results where positive, back pressure can be used to control bottom hole pressure during managed pressure drilling.

The performer is chained to the frame with her torso in line with the drilling axis. A cover, consisting of translucent paper stretched on a circular frame, is attached to the apparatus in front of the performer, obscuring the centre of her torso. The machine is then started: the drill bit rotates and the machine begins advancing slowly towards the performer. Then the device appears to go out of control and speed up (sometimes with pyrotechnics for added drama).
