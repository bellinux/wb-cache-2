25|$|It was Neil's {{last season}} {{and it was a}} shame that his amazing career should end in an uncharacteristic {{outburst}} of bad temper against Ted Dexter. I never did {{get to the bottom of}} the row but perhaps it was just because he and Ted were total opposites as people. All I know is that his press comments on Ted lost him a lot of friends. These attacks upset the MCC players more than anything else that happened on that tour, and for Neil to retire from the game on this sour note was disappointing for those who had played with an against him, and for the public who had enjoyed his performances. For all this, you couldn't help admiring some of Neil's knocks, including his sixth Test century against England. He was nearly always exciting to watch because he was the sort of batsman who was supremely capable of winning or saving a match. He was also good to bowl to because he <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> chance; he played shots and he took risks. And his fielding was quite brilliant; in this series, it was easily the best on either side. He stopped some wonderful shots in the covers and took some terrific catches. It was just sad to see such a talented man consumed by such bitterness.|$|E

In England, she was warmly welcomed by George V, who declared that [...] "apart {{from the common}} aims, which we pursue, there are other and dear ties between us. Her Majesty the Queen, my dear cousin, is British born." [...] Similarly, Marie wrote that {{the day of her}} arrival in England was [...] "a great day for me, one of emotions, sweet, happy and the same time glorious emotions to come back as Queen to my own country, to be received officially, in all honour and enthusiastically into the bargain – to feel your heart swell with pride and satisfaction, to feel your heart beat and tears start into your eyes, while something <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> lump into your throat!" [...] These state visits were a symbolic recognition of the prestige Romania had gained after World War I. Whilst visiting Geneva, Marie and Ferdinand became the first royals to enter the newly established headquarters of the League of Nations.|$|E

500|$|Weiss {{said that}} they wanted to depict a {{full-fledged}} battle, [...] "From the beginning we knew that one thing we'd never had on the show was a true medieval pitched battle where two sides bring all the forces they can into play in some battlefield that's somehow negotiated or agreed upon and they go at each other until one of them wins and the other one loses. This is a staple of human history, and we started to look through film samples of it. There really wasn't one that both made you feel {{what it was like to}} be there on the ground and <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> sense of the geography of the battle." [...] According to Benioff, they also wanted to demonstrate the role luck plays in battle, [...] "Just to feel the kind of randomness of it where there's arrows falling from everywhere, people are getting killed, people are getting trampled by horses, and so much of it is just luck. Jon Snow is a very skilled combatant, but part of the reason he survives this battle is just he gets lucky".|$|E
500|$|To {{eliminate}} dialogue {{trees from}} System Shock, the team prevented the player from ever meeting a living non-player character (NPC): {{the plot is}} instead conveyed by e-mail messages and log discs, {{many of which were}} recorded by dead NPCs. Here, Grossman took influence from Edgar Lee Masters' Spoon River Anthology, a collection of poems written as the epitaphs of fictional individuals. Grossman later summarized the idea as [...] "a series of short speeches from people, that when put together, <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> history of a place." [...] The removal of conversations was an attempt by the team to make the game a more [...] "integrated whole" [...] than was Ultima Underworld--one with a greater focus on immersion, atmosphere and [...] "the feeling of 'being there'". They sought to [...] "plunge [...] into the fiction and never provide an opportunity for breaking that fiction"; and so they tried to erase the distinction between plot and exploration. Church considered this direction to be an organic progression from Ultima Underworld, and he later said, [...] "On some level it's still just a dungeon simulator, and we're still just trying to evolve that idea." [...] Shortly before production began, Tribe bassist Greg LoPiccolo was contracted to work on the game's music. He had visited his friend Rex Bradford at the company, and was spontaneously asked by the game's programmers—many of whom were fans of the band—if he would take the role. The game entered production in February 1993. Although Grossman was heavily involved in the game's early planning, he {{had little to do with}} its production, aside from providing assistance with writing and voice acting.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} by commentators; some reviewers praised it for its composition, while other critics {{felt that the}} lyrics were not profound. Billboard Chuck Taylor called the song [...] "instantly memorable" [...] and praised its instrumentation for being different [...] "from the scores of adolescent thrust-rockers currently dominating the scene." [...] Dubbing it [...] "elegant, timeless pop/rock", Taylor qualified it as [...] "one of the great discoveries of the year", while Pete Waterman, writing for The Guardian in 2007, stated it was [...] "one of [...] favourite songs of recent years". Eric R. Danton from the Hartford Courant [...] classified it as the best track on the album, while Erlewine called it [...] "the template {{for the rest of}} his debut". In contrast, Wilson Kung said the song [...] "pales in comparison to some of the truly strong songs" [...] on the album Daniel Powter. Alan Connor of BBC News Magazine said it is a typical sentimental song but that in [...] "Bad Day"'s case [...] "there's even less detail". He said the song [...] "is so low on the specifics, there are some couplets that feel like they've been translated from a foreign language, possibly by a computer". A writer for The Daily Edge called it [...] "a song so sweet it <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> toothache", while a reviewer from The Scotsman called it a [...] "horrible song". Bill Lamb said it [...] "feels genuine" [...] but [...] "if you are looking for depth, this is not your song", Chris Lee of the Los Angeles Times said the song is [...] "baleful but soulful", and People commented: [...] "'Bad Day' may be catchy enough to overcome its trite lyrics".|$|E

2500|$|Following the killing, Harambe became {{subject of}} {{multiple}} viral memes. Vox wrote in November that Harambe has an [...] "undeniable status as 2016’s meme of the year." [...] As People magazine wrote: [...] "Harambe continues {{to live on}} in the collective mind of the internet, entering into a rarefied state of venerated meme status." [...] One of the most widespread memes was noted by The Washington Post and New York magazine who observed a proliferation of over-the-top and fake tributes to Harambe. [...] "The idea is, the more intense and more sincere-seeming the expression of mourning is, the funnier the joke." [...] For example, the [...] "Dicks out for Harambe" [...] meme {{can be seen as}} a fake tribute to an incident that would normally engender sincere mourning. As Aja Romano of Vox wrote, [...] "If you were a progressive, the Harambe meme <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> chance to mock what you viewed as the hypocritical haranguing of the mainstream while avoiding real issues of social justice; and if you were a conservative, the Harambe meme <b>gave</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> chance to mock liberal hysteria." [...] One meme is a play on conspiracy theories, such as [...] "Bush did Harambe", a reference to the 9/11 conspiracy theories. In Australia, people joked about supporting Harambe's corpse as a write-in candidate on the ballot for the federal election. Public Policy Polling included Harambe in their polling for the U.S. presidential election. The dead gorilla had 5% support in late July 2016 (ahead of Green Party nominee Jill Stein) and 2% in August 2016 (tied with Stein).|$|E
2500|$|The {{first day}} of {{negotiations}} was originally planned to last just two hours, from 6:00pm to 8:00pm VLAT, after which the two delegations would break for dinner and then retire for the night before resuming talks the next morning. The negotiations had been so productive, however, that the Soviets and the Americans agreed to forgo dinner and continue the talks, ultimately taking three short breaks that evening instead of one long one to eat. The Americans, afraid that the Sanatorium had been bugged, elected to take their breaks outside, despite the sub-zero temperatures. During one of the breaks, Brezhnev presented Ford with , and while Ford was quite impressed {{by the quality of}} the work he did not think it looked much like him.
