40|$|Work-related vehicle crashes are {{a common}} cause of {{occupational}} injury. Yet, there are few studies that investigate management practices used for light vehicle fleets (i. e. vehicles less than 4. 5 tonnes). One of the impediments to obtaining and sharing information on effective <b>fleet</b> safety <b>management</b> {{is the lack of}} an evidence-based, standardised measurement tool. This article describes the initial development of an audit tool to assess <b>fleet</b> safety <b>management</b> practices in light vehicle fleets. The audit tool was developed by triangulating information from {{a review of the literature}} on <b>fleet</b> safety <b>management</b> practices and from semi-structured interviews with 15 fleet managers and 21 fleet drivers. A preliminary useability assessment was conducted with 5 organisations. The audit tool assesses the <b>management</b> of <b>fleet</b> safety against five core categories: (1) management, systems and processes; (2) monitoring and assessment; (3) employee recruitment, training and education; (4) vehicle technology, selection and maintenance; and (5) vehicle journeys. Each of these core categories has between 1 and 3 sub-categories. Organisations are rated at one of 4 levels on each sub-category. The <b>fleet</b> safety <b>management</b> audit tool is designed to identify the extent to which fleet safety is managed in an organisation against best practice. It is intended that the audit tool be used to conduct audits within an organisation to provide an indicator of progress in managing fleet safety and to consistently benchmark performance against other organisations. Application of the tool by fleet safety researchers is now needed to inform its further development and refinement and to permit psychometric evaluation. 17 page(s...|$|R
