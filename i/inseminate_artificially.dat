Lactating females from 3 Kansas locations were utilized. Crossbred Angus cows (n = 212) from the Agriculture Research Center in Hays (ARCH; location 1); Angus-Hereford crossbred cows (n = 249) from the Kansas State University Cow-Calf Unit (location 2); and purebred Angus, Hereford, and Simmental cows (n = 144) from the Kansas State University Purebred Beef Unit (location 3) were used in this study.

Cows within each location were blocked by parity and assigned randomly within blocks to be artificially inseminated (AI) at 4 different times after the PGF 2 [Alpha] injection of the protocol: 48, 56, 64, or 72 h. Pregnancy diagnosis occurred at 32 and 63 d after insemination. Blood samples were collected 9 to 10 d and just before the first GnRH injection. Radioimmunoassays were performed on the blood sera samples to determine progesterone concentrations. Progesterone concentrations determined that approximately 60 % of cows were cycling at the initiation of the study. A difference in cyclicity was observed with regards to age as well as body condition score. Pregnancies per AI (P/AI) at d 32 varied according to location and cycling status. Pregnancy loss between d 32 and 63 also was greatest for cows inseminated at 48 and 72 h. As pregnancy rates at d 63 increased with the 56 - and 64 -h treatments, pregnancy loss decreased. A significant difference in calving interval was detected among treatments, the shortest calving interval at 56 h. Results indicated that in most situations, the 56 - and 64 -h treatments presented the most desirable outcomes. The 56 -h treatment presented the greatest number of P/AI for younger cows (≤ 3 yr), but for older cows, inseminations anytime 56 h or later produced the most P/AI. Overall pregnancy rates at d 63 were greatest for the 56 -h treatment, with the fewest pregnancy losses. Given the interactions that seem to exist among location, cycling status, and age, further work is necessary to better define these relationships with the applied protocol...|$|E

Of the original 591 heifers, 14 % were culled.

Heifers were <b>inseminated</b> <b>artificially</b> (AI) during 30 days followed by 30 days of natural mating. Heifers given PG on day 17 after MGA had a first-service conception rate of 69. 9 % compared with 65. 8 % for heifers given PG on day 19.

40|$|Summary &mdash; According {{to early}} records, horses were <b>inseminated</b> <b>artificially</b> long before other large {{domestic}} animals. By {{the end of}} the l 9 th century, there were reports from several European coun-tries of artificial insemination being used in mares but it was in Russia, {{in the first decade of}} the present century, that the technique was first developed for serious commercial use. Between the 2 world wars, there was extensive use of Al not only in the Soviet Union but also in a number of cen-tral European and Balkan countries. After 1945, Al in Europe declined in parallel with the use of the horse as a farm animal. By 1962, it was estimated that the total number of mares being <b>inseminated</b> <b>artificially</b> throughout the world was 750 000 of which 80 % were in China. At that time, the number of cows being bred by Al had risen to over 58 million. There are a number of reasons, apart from the obvious commercial ones, why Al has proved less popular for horses than for cattle. There is wide variability in survival of spermatozoa from individual stallions following freezing and thawing. Only 30 % of a group of stallions regularly produced semen that retained good motility following freezing. In addition, although the mechanics of insemination are easy in the mare, oestrus detection in the absence of a stallion can be difficult. Therefore, because the length of oestrus varies considerably and the relationship between it and ovulation is much less precise than in other large domestic ani...|$|R

Fifty three pregnant buffaloes (G 1, n = 32; G 2, n = 21) were followed to verify the birth rate. Data were analyzed by Chi-square test. The conception rate, the accessory CL rate and the birth rate were higher in G 2 than in G 1 (P< 0. 05).
