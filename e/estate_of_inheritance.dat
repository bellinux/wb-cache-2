5000|$|Before the Law of Property Act 1925, a {{freehold}} estate transferable to the owner's [...] "heirs and assigns" [...] (that is, successors by inheritance, or purchase gift, respectively), was a fee simple estate. When transfer, by inheritance or otherwise, {{was limited to}} lineal descendants ("heirs of the body" [...] or [...] "heirs of the blood") of {{the first person to}} whom the estate was given, it was a fee tail estate.

60|$|This act {{is worthy}} of {{attention}} {{on account of the}} singularity of some of its provisions. Being sent for education to any Popish school or college abroad, upon conviction, incurs (if the party sent has any <b>estate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inheritance)</b> a kind of unalterable and perpetual outlawry. The tender and incapable age of such a person, his natural subjection to the will of others, his necessary, unavoidable ignorance of the laws, stands for nothing in his favor. He is disabled to sue in law or equity; to be guardian, executor, or administrator; he is rendered incapable of any legacy or deed of gift; he forfeits all his goods and chattels forever; and he forfeits for his life all his lands, hereditaments, offices, and estate of freehold, and all trusts, powers, or interests therein. All persons concerned in sending them or maintaining them abroad, by the least assistance of money or otherwise, are involved in the same disabilities, and subjected to the same penalties.|$|E
60|$|To {{begin with}} the first great {{instrument}} of national happiness and strength, its industry: I must observe, that, although these penal laws do, indeed, inflict many hardships on those who are obnoxious to them, yet their chief, their most extensive, and most certain operation is upon property. Those civil constitutions which promote industry are such as facilitate the acquisition, secure the holding, enable the fixing, and suffer the alienation of property. Every law which obstructs it {{in any part of}} this distribution is, in proportion to the force and extent of the obstruction, a discouragement to industry. For a law against property is a law against industry,--the latter having always the former, and nothing else, for its object. Now as to the acquisition of landed property, which is the foundation and support of all the other kinds, the laws have disabled three fourths of the inhabitants of Ireland from acquiring any <b>estate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> for life or years, or any charge whatsoever on which two thirds of the improved yearly value is not reserved for thirty years.|$|E

50|$|From 1290 to {{the reign}} of Henry VIII, there is no statute of the first {{importance}} dealing with real <b>estate.</b> The reign <b>of</b> Henry VIII, like that of Edward I, is signalized by three acts, the effects of which continue to this day. The one which has had the most lasting influence in law is the Statute of Uses, intended to provide against secrecy of sales of land. As a necessary sequel, the Statute of Enrollments required all bargains and sales of land be duly enrolled. Bargain and sale {{was a form of}} equitable transfer which had for some purposes superseded the common law feoffment. It applied only to <b>estates</b> <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> and not to terms of years. The unforeseen effect of the act of 1535, Enrolment of Bargains of Lands, etc. was to establish as the ordinary form of conveyance until 1841 the conveyance by lease and release. Uses having become legal estate by the Statute of Uses, and therefore no longer devisable, the Statute of Wills (explained by the Wills Act of 1542) was passed to remedy this inconvenience. At least as late as 1911, it remained law as to wills made before 1838.|$|R

50|$|He was {{now living}} in open warfare with the {{residing}} Canons of Lichfield, who served him on 19 February 1667-8 with formal articles of complaint. The success with which the Dean set at defiance all complaints of his conduct, and his brother’s position at Court, caused then a general expectation at Durham and Lichfield {{that he would be}} promoted to the next vacant bishopric.And that was realised in the following year, for when Sir Henry Wood concluded with Lord Treasurer Clifford the treaty for the marriage of his only surviving child Mary to the King’s eldest son by the Duchess of Cleveland, {{it was part of the}} bargain that the vacant bishopric of Lichfield should be given to his brother. Accordingly, the Dean was elected Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry on 9 June 1671, and was consecrated at Lambeth on 2 July by the Archbishop of Canterbury.At the same time and place, Dr. Nathaniel Crew (afterwards Lord Crew and Bishop of Durham) was consecrated Bishop of Oxford. He was a prelate of the same type as Bishop Wood, and resembled him in many circumstances of his career. They were both cadets of influential families, and owed their advancement to family interest at Court without any pretension to professional merit. Both eventually succeeded to great <b>estates</b> <b>of</b> <b>inheritance,</b> and died without issue. Each of these Bishops was regarded by the Clergy of his time as a scandal to his order and the Church, but is remembered for munificence and for charitable foundations which are still in existence.|$|R

50|$|In law, a {{base fee}} is a {{freehold}} <b>estate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> which is limited or qualified by {{the existence of}} certain conditions. In modern property law the commonest example of a base fee is an estate created by a tenant in tail, not in possession, who bars the entail {{without the consent of}} the protector of the settlement. Any attempt to bar the entail without the consent of the Protector would only be partially successful. Though he bars his own issue (the rights of the future tenants in tail), he cannot bar any remainder or reversion, and the estate (i.e. the base fee) thus created is determinable on the failure of his issue in tail. The base fee can be defined as rights that would last {{for as long as the}} fee tail would have lasted, but which will end when the line of descent stipulated in the fee tail ran out.|$|E

50|$|While {{technically}} {{property was}} divided into separate property and community property upon solemnizing of the marriage, early settlers often had no separate property, or brought plots of land that were virtually worthless into their marriages and reaped the benefit of such land only after years of combined labour. Thus, in practice, much separate property was incorporated into the marital community to avoid future disputes about added values and so forth. Even in subsequent generations, when land was more developed and children each inherited a portion <b>of</b> the family <b>estate,</b> <b>inheritances</b> <b>of</b> family land were often treated as movable property and therefore incorporated into subsequent marital communities, complicating patterns <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> and linking families together in intricate ways.|$|R

5000|$|In the Avegnor case, the Louisiana Supreme Court {{held that}} {{there was such a}} privity between a person whose life estate had been {{condemned}} under the Act of July 17, 1862, and his heirs, that the latter were bound by a suit and decree to enforce a mortgage executed by their ancestor containing the pact de non alienando, to which the ancestor alone had been made a party defendant. It is sustained by Wallach v. Van Riswick, ubi supra, as will appear by the following passages from that Court's opinion:"If it be contended that the heirs of Charles S. Wallach," [...] the person whose property had been condemned,"cannot take by descent unless their father, at his death, was seized of an <b>estate</b> <b>of</b> <b>inheritance,</b> e.g., reversion or a remainder, it may be answered that even at common law it was not always necessary that the ancestor should be seized to enable the heir to take by descent. Shelley's Case is that where the ancestor might have taken and been seized, the heir shall inherit. Fortescue, J., in Thornby v. Fleetwood, 1 Str. 318.""If it were true that at common law the heirs could not take in any case where their ancestor was not seized at his death, the present case must be determined by the statute. Charles S. Wallach was seized of the entire fee of the land before its confiscation, and the act of Congress interposed to take from him that seizing for a limited time. That it was competent to do, attaching the limitation {{for the benefit of the}} heirs. It wrought no corruption of blood. In Lord de la Warre's Case, 11 Coke 1a, it was resolved by the justices""{{that there was}} a difference betwixt disability personal and temporary and a disability absolute and perpetual, as where one is attainted of treason and felony, that is an absolute and perpetual disability, by corruption of blood, for any of his posterity to claim any inheritance in fee simple, either as heir to him or any ancestor above him, but when one is disabled by Parliament (without any attainder) to claim the dignity for his life, it is a personal disability for his life only, and his heir, after his death, may claim as heir to him or to any ancestor above him.""There is a close analogy between that case and the present.""Without pursuing this discussion further, we repeat, that to hold that any estate or interest remained in Charles S. Wallach after the confiscation and sale of the land in controversy, would defeat the avowed purpose of the confiscation act and the only justification for its enactment, and to hold that the joint resolution was not intended for the benefit of his heirs exclusively, to enable them to take the inheritance after his death, would give preference to the guilty over the innocent. We cannot so hold." ...|$|E
