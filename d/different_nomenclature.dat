40|$|The {{availability}} of the complete sequence of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome has allowed a comprehensive analysis of the genes encoding cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins in this organism. On {{the basis of this}} complete inventory a new nomen-clature for the yeast ribosomal proteins is presented. In the past, cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins of the yeast Saccharo-myces cerevisiae have been characterized using different two-dimensional electrophoretic separation methods. As a consequence, at least three <b>different</b> <b>nomenclatures</b> for yeast ribosomal proteins came into existence, viz. according to Kruiswijk and Planta (1), Warner and Gorenstein (2), and Otaka and Osawa (3), as indicated in Table 1, second column, from left to right, respectively.
