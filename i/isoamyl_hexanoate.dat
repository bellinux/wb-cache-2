40|$|Teran PTP is a {{protected}} wine with a recognized traditional denomination produced from a grapevine variety ‘Refošk’ in winegrowing district Kras in Slovenia (European Union, 2009; Pravilnik, 2008). The aromatic profile of 82 Teran PTP wines produced in years 2011, 2012 and 2013 was monitored. Intotal {{the content of}} 16 volatile compounds was determined. The volatile compounds from wine were extracted following the liquid-liquid extraction and determined with a GC-MS method. The odour activity values and relative odour contributions were calculated for each volatile compound identified. Among sensorial important volatiles the highest odour activity values were determined for ethyl octanoate, ethyl <b>hexanoate,</b> <b>isoamyl</b> acetate and ethyl butyrate. Other research papers also showed, that all red wines investigated except one contained ethyl octanoate, ethyl <b>hexanoate,</b> <b>isoamyl</b> acetate and ethyl butyrate above sensory thresholds. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} red wine {{phenolic}} extracts on the stability of wine volatile esters and terpenes was examined. Muscat (white) and Xinomavro (red) wines were enriched with each extract at 120 or 200 mg/L, and stored in open bottles at 20 °C for 3 and 2. 5 days, respectively. Moreover, a model wine medium containing <b>isoamyl</b> acetate, ethyl <b>hexanoate</b> and linalool was enriched with each extract at 100 mg/L, and stored in sealed bottles at 20 °C for 45 – 90 days. All samples were analysed for volatiles using SPME along with GC-MS analysis. Phenolic composition of wine extracts was determined using HPLC-DAD. No effect on the concentration of any volatiles was observed {{as a result of}} the addition of each extract in each wine or the model medium. A wine extract rich in phenolic acids and another one rich in anthocyanins and flavanols inhibited the decrease of volatile esters and terpenes in one or both wines and the model medium. Among them were several important for the aroma of wine such as ethyl acetate, <b>isoamyl</b> acetate, ethyl <b>hexanoate,</b> ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate and linalool. The results presented here indicate that wine phenolic acids, and anthocyanins or flavanols may be taken into account as potent inhibitors of the disappearance of volatile esters and terpenes in wines...|$|R
40|$|The {{contents}} {{and composition of}} essential oils obtained from Heracleum sosnowskyi and Heracleum mantegazzianum (Apiaceae) were examined. essential oils were investigated by the GC/MS method. The composition of hogweeds’ essential oils was examined {{in order to determine}} toxic compounds that could have a direct influence on the health of people and animals living in close proximity to both species. It was found that the essential oils, except for derivatives of coumarins, contain numerous toxic compounds, e. g. isobutyl isobutyrate, <b>isoamyl</b> butyrate, hexyl <b>hexanoate,</b> 1 -hexadecanol etc. No significant differences were found in the chemical composition of the examined seed samples of Heracleum, which confirms the suggestions that the species can be closely related...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{series of}} silica-based {{materials}} were employed as sorbents within solid-phase microextraction vials. The {{aim of the}} study was to evaluate the effect of an additional phase on the distribution of the volatile and less volatile analytes. The adsorption of six probe molecules, namely <b>isoamyl</b> acetate, ethyl <b>hexanoate</b> (ethyl caproate), phenylethyl alcohol, ethyl octanoate (ethyl caprilate), 2 -phenylethyl acetate, and ethyl decanoate, was monitored by detecting the desorbed amount on a DVD-CAR-PDMS fiber from Pilsen beer. The microextraction process involved the presence of different silica-based phases produced via different methods: xerogel produced by hydrolytic and non-hydrolytic routes, aerogel, pyrogenic, and precipitated silica. The resulting data are discussed in correlation with sorbent texture properties (specific area and pore diameter). The modification of silica with alkyl groups also affects the preconcentrated amount of the target molecules in the headspace. The presence of sorbents was shown to affect the analyte signal more than the addition of NaCl or the use of ultrasound...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of high-pressure homogenisation on the aroma retention of mixed sodium caseinate-whey protein (2 % + 2 % w/v) emulsions. For this purpose, raw and pasteurised emulsions, with different fat contents (5 %, 8 % and 15 % w/v) and subjected to different homogenisation pressures (0, 18, 100 and 150 MPa), were produced. The retention of seven aroma compounds (hexanal, benzaldehyde, diacetyl, ethyl butyrate, <b>isoamyl</b> acetate, ethyl <b>hexanoate</b> and ethyl octanoate) was evaluated by static headspace gas chromatography. Results showed that aroma release was affected by the presence and the quantity of the lipid phase. As regards homogenisation, an increase in the retention of hexanal with homogenisation pressure was observed and interactions between hexanal and caseinate were suggested. Benzaldehyde showed significant changes in headspace partition with increasing pressure only in the 5 % fat content emulsions, whereas no homogenisation effect on aroma retention was observed for diacetyl or esters...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA novel {{dynamic model}} was {{developed}} for predicting the synthesis kinetics of the principal aroma compounds produced by yeasts during winemaking fermentations: isobutanol, isoamyl alcohol, <b>isoamyl</b> acetate, ethyl <b>hexanoate</b> and ethyl octanoate. The parameters of the model were identified from nine fermentations performed at temperatures between 18 and 30 degrees C and with different initial nitrogen contents, {{in the range of}} 70 to 410 mgN/L. The model was validated in six independent experiments with conditions in the same range. Predictions were accurate for these volatile compounds: the mean difference between experimental and estimated values for fermentative aroma synthesis throughout the process was below 10 %, for both the fermentations used to build the model and those used for validation. This model is the first to simulate the production kinetics of fermentative aromas and provides new insight into the synthesis of these volatile compounds. It will facilitate the development of innovative strategies for controlling the production of those aromas in winemaking, through management of the principal control factors: assimilable nitrogen content and temperature during the alcoholic fermentation...|$|R
40|$|Five yeast strains {{isolated}} from agave juice were studied for their fermentative and aromatic capacity. The experiments were performed using agave juice supplemented with ammonium sulphate, as is commonly done in tequila distilleries. Three strains classified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed high biomass and ethanol production, {{as well as}} higher ethanol tolerance than those classified as Kloeckera africana and Kloeckera apiculata, which showed scarce growth. The results suggest that Kloeckera strains were affected by nutritional limitation and/or toxic compounds present in agave juice. Agave juice analyses showed a lower amino acid content than those reported in grape juice. S. cerevisiae strains produced predominantly amyl and isoamyl alcohols, n-propanol, 2 -phenyl ethanol, succinic acid, glycerol, methanol, <b>isoamyl</b> acetate, ethyl <b>hexanoate,</b> acetaldehyde and isobutanol, whereas Kloeckera strains showed a high production of acetic acid, 2 -phenyl ethyl acetate and ethyl acetate. The methanol concentration was significantly different among the yeasts studied. The diversity between three S. cerevisiae strains were higher for the aromatic profile than for genetic level and kinetic parameter. On the other hand, the diversity of Kloeckera yeasts were lower than Saccharomyces yeasts even when belonging to two different species...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBesides deacidifying wine, Oenococcus oeni bring {{significant}} changes in the chemical composition of wine by releasing esters by the action of their own esterases. The impact of O. oeni esterases remains relatively unexplored. Four esterase genes were identified from O. oeni genome (estA 2, estA 7, estC, and estB). The dual objective of this study was, first to use a genetic tool enabling the expression of esterase genes in enological conditions and, second, to investigate the impact of O. oeni esterase gene expression during winemaking on wine aromatic profile. Both estA 2 and estA 7 genes were successfully cloned and expressed in O. oeni and recombinant strains were inoculated in Aligote wine to initiate malolactic fermentation (MLF). Ester profile of experimental wine was established by SPME-GC-MS. EstA 2 caused significant decreases in the concentrations of <b>isoamyl</b> acetate, ethyl <b>hexanoate,</b> isobutyl acetate, and hexyl acetate, by 42. 7 %, 23. 4 %, 51. 5 %, and 28. 9 %, respectively. EstA 2 has preferential hydrolytic activity toward acetate esters from higher alcohols. EstA 7 has synthetic activity toward hexyl acetate with a significant 22. 7 % increase. This study reports the first efficient expression system enabling the production of a functional protein in O. oeni in enological conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} (-) - and (+) -methyl jasmonate on the bioformation of {{selected}} volatile esters in strawberry was evaluated. To that end, post-harvest treatments of strawberry fruits with (-) - and (+) -methyl jasmonate vapors were accomplished. The selected esters were ethyl 2 -methyl butanoate, <b>isoamyl</b> acetate, ethyl <b>hexanoate</b> and hexyl acetate. The results obtained {{were compared with}} those provided by the treatment of strawberries with the commercial racemic mixture, i. e., (-/+) -methyl jasmonate. In addition, untreated samples were analyzed {{to be used as}} a control. Although the target esters were differently affected by the three treatments depending on the ester considered, a general trend could be observed. The levels of ethyl 2 -methyl butanoate and isoamyl acetate decreased significantly with respect to the control sample with both (-) -methyl jasmonate and (+) -methyl jasmonate treatments. However, the variation in the concentrations of ethyl hexanoate and hexyl acetate depended on whether the (-) - or the (+) -enantiomer of methyl jasmonate was used in the treatment. These results reflect different activity of both methyl jasmonate enantiomers on the enzymes regulating strawberry ester biosynthesis. The application of methyl jasmonate enantiomers is here proposed as a possible mean to minimize strawberry aroma alterations and/or losses during post-harvest and storage. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{reports on the}} {{composition}} of volatiles of most grape marcs (bagaceiras) commercially available in Portugal. These spirits, which are a valuable by-product of the winemaking industry, are obtained via steam-distillation of grape pomace after storage under anaerobic conditions for a given period of time. An impetus for this research is the increasingly strict European legal standards pertaining to the levels of health hazard volatile compounds (e. g., methanol) {{and the lack of}} comprehensive studies on this topic for Portuguese bagaceiras. Assays were performed by gas/liquid chromatography for alcohols (methanol, 2 -butanol, 1 -propanol, 2 -methyl-propanol, allylic alcohol, 1 -butanol, 2 -methyl- 1 -butanol, 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol, hexanol,trans- 3 -hexenol,cis- 3 -hexenol,trans- 2 -hexenol, and 2 -phenyl-ethanol), carboxylic acids (isobutyric, isovaleric, hexanoic, octanoic, decanoic, and dodecanoic acids), esters (ethyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, <b>isoamyl</b> acetate, ethyl <b>hexanoate,</b> hexyl acetate, ethyl lactate, ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate, diethyl succinate, 2 -phenyl-ethyl-acetate, and ethyl dodecanoate), as well as for an aldehyde (ethanal) and its acetal (diethoxy- 1 - 1 -ethane). The average values obtained for Portuguese bagaceiras(and the corresponding ranges) were comparable with corresponding values for grape pomaces manufactured in other Mediterranean countries (viz. Spain). The mean contents of methanol were ca. 3389 mg/liter, a value below the accepted threshold of 5000 mg/liter for a 50 % (v/v) ethanol-containing grape marc (EC Regulation No. 1576 / 89) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{differences}} among young wines from berries at 3 heights (fruit-zone 1 (FZ 1) : 140 - 200 cm above the ground; FZ 2 : 80 - 140 cm; FZ 3 : 20 - 80 cm) on Vitis vinifera L. cv Merlot and Chardonnay were assessed {{to evaluate the}} influence of berry-heights on the final wine quality. Stir bar sorptive extraction coupled with gas chromatography&# 8211;mass spectrometry (SBSE-GC/MS) was used to analyse the characteristics of wine aromas. The results revealed that berry-heights exert significant influence on ethyl octanoate, <b>isoamyl</b> acetate, ethyl <b>hexanoate,</b> and ethyl butanoate in various- FZ Merlot wines and beta-damascenone in the Chardonnay -FZ wines. As a result, FZ 1 wines of Merlot are more aromatic than the other FZ wines and had the highest floral and fruity series intensity. For the Chardonnay wines, fruity and sweet series were highly intense in the FZ 1 wines. The PCA results demonstrated {{a high degree of}} differences in the aroma of various- FZ wines of the 2 grape cultivars, especially the Merlot variety, which indicates a need to separate the berries from the different- FZs. These results suggest that wineries should consider the possibility of separating berries from different-heights to produce wines of distinctive quality. Furthermore, this knowledge about the volatile composition of young wines offers a means of evaluating the aroma potential of wines from berries taking into account their position along the vines...|$|R
40|$|Bottle {{refermentation}} which imparts beer effervescence {{and resistance}} against infection and oxidation {{is also known}} to improve flavor profile and stability. By this process, some stale off-flavors exhaled by aldehydes (trans- 2 -nonenal, 3 -methylthiopropionaldehyde, 3 - methylbutanal [...] ) are reduced into alcohols (1, 2). Unfortunately, yeast esterases can also strongly affect the beer fruity character by hydrolyzing <b>isoamyl</b> acetate, ethyl <b>hexanoate</b> and ethyl octanoate (1, 2). Thiols {{are known to have}} a strong impact on the overall aroma of fermented beverages (3). More than ten polyfunctional thiols were detected in fresh lager beers (4). The thiols profile of refermented beer has been little studied. In this work, the polyfunctional thiol contents of commercial and pilot beers submitted or not to bottle refermentation were compared. A strong organoleptic impact of the bottle refermentation process was evidenced in all samples by a training panel (70 %). A specific pHMB thiols extraction (5) was applied and the extracts analyzed by GC-MS, GC-PFPD and GColfactometry (AEDA). A large number of sulfanylalcools, sulfanylacetates and sulfanylcarbonyles revealed produced during the refermentation process, especially after three weeks. Among them, 3 -sulfanylpropanol reached a FD olfactometric values up to 32768. According to their beta-sulfanyl structures, hop cystein adducts are suspected to be hydrolyzed by refermentation yeast-derived lyases. Therefore, a better control of the refermentation process requires both an excellent control of yeast vitality and a strict selection of the hop varieties...|$|R
40|$|Torulaspora delbrueckii is {{becoming}} widely recommended for improving some specific characteristics of wines. However, {{its impact on}} wine quality is still far from satisfactory at the winery level, mostly because it is easily replaced by S. cerevisiae-like yeasts during must fermentation. New T. delbrueckii killer strains were here isolated and selected for winemaking. They killed S. cerevisiae yeasts {{and were able to}} dominate and complete the fermentation of sterile grape must. Sequential yeast inoculation of non-sterile white must with T. delbrueckii followed by S. cerevisiae did not ensure T. delbrueckii dominance or wine quality improvement. Only a single initial must inoculation at high cell concentrations allowed the T. delbrueckii killer strains to dominate and complete the must fermentation to reach above 11 % ethanol, but not the non-killer strains. None of the wines underwent malolactic fermentation as long as the must had low turbidity and pH. Although no statistically significant differences were found in the wine quality score, the S. cerevisiae-dominated wines were preferred over the T. delbrueckii-dominated ones because the former had high-intensity fresh fruit aromas while the latter had lower intensity, but nevertheless nice and unusual dried fruit/pastry aromas. Except for ethyl propanoate and 3 -ethoxy- 1 -propanol, which were more abundant in the T. delbrueckii–dominated wines, most of the compounds with fresh fruit odour descriptors, including those with the greatest odour activity values (<b>isoamyl</b> acetate, ethyl <b>hexanoate,</b> and ethyl octanoate), were more abundant in the S. cerevisiae–dominated wines. The low relative concentrations of these fruity compounds made it possible to detect in the T. delbrueckii–dominated wines the low-relative-concentration compounds with dried fruit and pastry odours. An example was γ-ethoxy-butyrolactone which was significantly more abundant in these wines than in those dominated by S. cerevisiae...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Washington State UniversityThe {{influence}} of beer fraction interactions, chemical composition, and {{their combined influence}} on the sensory and chemical quality of beer was examined. Model beer solutions with varying levels of carbohydrate and protein content and known levels of volatile compounds were prepared. The model beer solutions were evaluated by a trained panel for sensory attributes, while the concentration of the volatile flavor compounds was determined by solid phase microextraction (SPME), solid phase dynamic extraction (SPDE) coupled to gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) coupled to gas chromatography flame ionization (GC/FID). Results were modeled by principal component analysis (PCA), and relationships between the instrumental and sensory variables were analyzed by partial least squares regression (PLSR). Results showed that the non-volatile fraction {{had a significant effect}} on volatile compound release and aroma perception. PCA showed that differentiation between samples was mainly due to protein content, and PLSR analysis indicated a weak correlation between the sensory and instrumental data. For instrumental analysis, the performance of SBSE and SPME for beer volatile fraction analysis was compared for various parameters, including linearity, limit of detection, repeatability, and recovery of four compounds (<b>isoamyl</b> acetate, ethyl <b>hexanoate,</b> myrcene, benzaldehyde) typically found in beer. Both methods were characterized by high linearity (r > 0. 996) and repeatability (RSD = 1. 76 to 10. 66 %). Higher recoveries were obtained by SBSE, and limits of detection were 1. 8 to 2. 8 times lower when compared to SPME. Both methods were used to analyze commercial lager beer, and results showed that SBSE has higher recovery efficiency, therefore showing promise for the analysis of beer volatiles. A headspace SPDE-GC/MS method for the analysis of the volatile fraction of beer was developed and optimized. The optimization step was carried out using two level full factorial and Doehlert designs for the determination of the optimum extraction conditions, and the optimized method was used for the analysis of five commercial beers, and a variety of compounds from different chemical classes were extracted from each sample, reflecting the difference in volatile profile among beers brewed with different raw materials, adjuncts, and brewing conditions.
