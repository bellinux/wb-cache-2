40|$|This {{essay is}} {{questioning}} {{if the state}} as an unsecured creditor <b>in</b> a <b>bankruptcy</b> proceeding, according {{to the principle of}} equal treatment, has the same rights as the other unsecured creditors. The principle of equal treatment means that creditors with unsecured claims are supposed to have mutually equal rights to <b>dividends</b> <b>in</b> a <b>bankruptcy.</b> <b>In</b> the Swedish <b>bankruptcy</b> law from 1987 there are recycling rules which means that some legal actions taken by the bankrupt debtor before the bankruptcy can be recycled to the bankruptcy estate. These rules do not apply on taxes. This essay analyzes whether the state should have this advantage or not. Another issue that’s discussed in this essay {{is whether or not the}} opinion of the Court of Appeal that a right of recourse on a claim for a paid Governmental wage guarantee exists before a bankruptcy should be established by the Supreme Court. This essay also analyzes if the rule which statutes that a company representative can become personally liable for the company tax debts should be abolished or not, since this rule means that the taxes on a larger scale than other claims are paid before the bankruptcy...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} <b>dividend</b> changes <b>in</b> {{an emerging}} market: Thailand. We begin {{by considering the}} possible effects of the Thai corporate environment on dividend policy. We develop a theoretical model that considers {{the relationship between the}} strength of investor power and <b>dividends</b> <b>in</b> an agency cost/free cashflow framework. This allows us to consider the conditions for the outcome (positive relationship) or substitute (negative relationship) models, as discussed by La Porta et al. (2000). Our model also allows us to consider the expropriation hypothesis, in which the presence of large controlling shareholders may actually reduce outside investor power, leading to lower dividends. We then turn to our empirical analysis. Employing a large sample of companies that changed <b>dividends</b> <b>in</b> Thailand during the period 1996 – 2009, we test for the signaling, free cashflow and life-cycle hypotheses. A further contribution of our analysis is that we consider the impact of investor power and ownership on <b>dividends</b> <b>in</b> Thailand. Overall, we find little support for the signaling hypothesis, but we find considerable support for the free cashflow and life-cycle hypotheses. Our analysis of ownership variables suggests that increasing investor power (for example, high ownership concentration together with the presence of domestic institutional ownership) results <b>in</b> higher <b>dividends,</b> <b>in</b> support of the outcome model, rather than the substitution or expropriation models...|$|R
