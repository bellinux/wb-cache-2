500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} in North America on DVD and Blu-ray in March 2009 by Magnet Films, and in the United Kingdom in August by Momentum Pictures. The American discs feature both the original Swedish dialogue and an English dubbed version, while the European versions feature only the Swedish, and an audio-descriptive track in English. Icons of Fright reported that the American release had been criticized for using new, oversimplified English subtitles instead of the original theatrical subtitles. Following customer complaints, Magnet stated that they would release an updated version with the original theatrical subtitles, but will not exchange current discs. Director Alfredson also expressed his dissatisfaction with the DVD subtitles, calling it a [...] "turkey translation". [...] "If you look on the 'net, people are furious about <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> done", he added. The UK release retains the theatrical subtitles.|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, Layfield {{was hired}} by CNBC to be a contributor. During a WWE house show in Munich, Germany early in June 2004, {{in an attempt to}} draw heel heat, he gave the crowd several Nazi salutes while goose-stepping around the ring. Such a display is illegal in Germany, and CNBC fired Layfield {{as a result of the}} controversy. In an {{interview}} with The Washington Post, Layfield explained [...] "I'm a bad guy [...] I'm supposed to incite the crowd. I've done it for decades. I really didn't think anything of – I know <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> I've lived [...] I've been to Dachau, seen those places where they exterminated millions of Jews.

Paul watched her go up the road between the hedges--a little, quick-stepping figure, and his heart ached for her, that she was thrust forward again into pain and trouble. And she, {{tripping}} so quickly in her anxiety, felt {{at the back of her}} her son's heart waiting on her, felt him bearing what part of the burden he could, even supporting her.

Their lives are, as far as I can see, no whit higher or more worthy than that of their own serfs, from whom they differ only that they eat more, drink more, and sleep on softer beds. Earl Harold expects better things than that of me, and I want to make myself worthy of being one of those in whom he can place {{confidence}} and on whom he can depend in case of trouble. I have heard him say <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> for England that our thanes are, in learning and culture, so far behind the nobles of other countries, and that if England is ever to take her place among great nations it must be by her thanes first raising themselves to the level of the nobles abroad, who are the counsellors of their kings. I can never hope to be anything like Earl Harold, who is the wisest and greatest of Englishmen, but I do hope so to fit myself that some day he may think me worthy of trust and confidence." ...|$|E

Those two-legged creatures know where those feeding-grounds are just as well as we do, and they hide there with their terrible guns just as they did when we were coming south. But it is much worse now, very much worse. You see, when we were going the other way, if we found them at one place we could go on to another, but when we are going north we cannot always do that. We cannot go any faster than Jack Frost does. Sometimes we are driven out of a place by the bang, bang of the terrible guns and go on, only to find that we have caught up with Jack Frost, and that the ponds and the rivers are still covered with ice. Then there is nothing to do but to turn back to where those terrible guns are waiting for us. We just HAVE to do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Madame spoke no {{more that}} morning. A {{telegram}} had come. Her {{son and daughter}} would arrive next morning early. They waited {{for a moment of}} consciousness to tell her; but the day went by, and in spite of oxygen and brandy it did not come. She was sinking fast; her only movements were a tiny compression now and then of the lips, a half-opening of the eyes, and once a smile when the parrot spoke. The rally came at eight o'clock. Mademoiselle was sitting by the couch when the voice came fairly strong: [...] "Give my love to my dear soldiers, and take them their francs out of my purse, please. Augustine, take care of Polly. I want to see if the emerald ring fits you. Take it off, please"; and, when it had been put on the little finger of the sobbing girl: [...] "There, you see, it does. That's very nice. Your sweetheart will like that when you have one. What do you say, Mademoiselle? My son and daughter coming? All that way?" [...] The lips smiled a moment, and then tears forced their way into her eyes. [...] "My darlings! How good of them! Oh! what a cold journey they'll have! Get my room ready, Augustine, with a good fire! What are you crying for? Remember what Polly says: 'Keep smiling!' Think <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> for the poor soldiers if we women go crying! The Queen never cries, and she has ever so much to make her!" ...|$|E

5000|$|De Villeneuve is {{repeatedly}} {{mentioned by}} Peter Cook on the Derek and Clive Come Again recording. This is because in 1977, de Villeneuve was employed by Phonogram Records {{in the capacity}} of Head of Public Relations & Publicity. Phonogram's was due to release Kevin Godley & Lol Creme's 'Consequences', a record on which Cook had worked, writing and playing all the male characters for a drama that filled three of the six sides. However, de Villeneuve repeatedly condemned the album and said <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> This is why Peter Cook says 'Justin de Villeneuve watch out!' and 'Justin de Villeneuve is my friend!' ...|$|R

6000|$|... 1. Lightnings {{here are}} to be taken for the illuminations of the Spirit in the gospel (Heb 10:32). As it is said {{in the book of}} Psalms, 'They looked unto him,' on the throne, 'and were lightened' (Psa 34:5). Or, as it is said in other places, 'The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven, the {{lightnings}} lightened the world' (Psa 77:18). And again, 'His lightnings enlightened the world, the earth saw and trembled' (Psa 97:4). This lightning therefore communicates light to them that sit in darkness. 'God,' saith the apostle, 'who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ' (2 Cor 4:6). It was from this throne that the light came that struck Paul off his horse, when he went to destroy it and the people that professed it (Acts 9:3). These are those lightnings by which sinners are made to see their sad condition, and by which they are made to see the way out of it. Art thou then made to see thy condition <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> and that the way out of it is by Jesus Christ? for, as I said, he is the throne of grace. Why then, come orderly in the light of these convictions to the throne from whence thy light did come, and cry there, as Samuel did to Eli, 'Here am I, for thou has called[13] me' (1 Sam 3:8). Thus did Saul by the light that made him see; by it he came to Christ, and cried, 'Who art thou, Lord?' and, 'What wouldst thou have me do?' (Acts 9:5,6). And is it not an encouragement to thee to come to him, when he lights thy candle that thou mightest see the way; yea, when he doth it on purpose that thou mightest come to him? 'He gives light to them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death,' what to do? 'to guide our feet into the way of peace' (Luke 1:79). This interpretation of this place seems to me most to cohere with what went before; for first you have here a throne, and one sitting on it; then you have the elders, and in them presented to you the whole church, sitting round about the throne; then you have in the words last read unto you, a discourse how they came thither, and that is, by the lightnings, thunderings, and voices that proceed out of the throne.|$|E
60|$|He {{accompanied}} me to {{the different}} schools, and as we walked up the long Toledo, and threaded {{our way through the}} sprightly Neapolitan crowd, he told me of the origin of the schools, and of the peculiar difficulties encountered in their foundation and maintenance. They are no older than the union of Naples with the Kingdom of Italy, when toleration of Protestantism was decreed by law; and from the first, their managers proceeded upon a principle of perfect openness and candor with the parents who wished {{to send their children to}} them. They announced that the children would be taught certain branches of learning, and that the whole Bible would be placed in their hands, to be studied and understood. In spite of this declaration of the Protestant character of the schools, the parents of the children were so anxious to secure them the benefits of education, that they willingly ran the risk of their becoming heretics. They were principally people of the lower classes,--laborers, hackmen, fishermen, domestics, and very small shopkeepers, but occasionally among them were parents able to send their children to other schools, yet preferring the thorough and conscientious system practiced in these. So the children came, and thanks to the peaceful, uncombative nature of Italian boys, who get on with much less waylaying and thumping and bullying than boys of northern blood, they have not been molested by their companions who still live the wild life of the streets, and they have only once suffered through interference of the priests. On complaint to the authorities the wrong was promptly redressed, and was not again inflicted. Of course these poor little people, picked up out of the vileness and ignorance of a city that had suffered for ages the most degrading oppression, are by no means regenerate yet, but there seems to be great hope for them. Now at least they are taught a reasonable and logical morality--and who can tell what wonders the novel instruction may not work? They learn for the first time that it is a foolish shame to lie and cheat, and it would scarcely be surprising if some of them were finally persuaded that Honesty is the best Policy--a maxim that few Italians believe. And here lies the trouble,--in the unfathomable, disheartening duplicity of the race. The children are not quarrelsome, nor cruel, nor brutal; but the servile defect of falsehood fixed by long generations of slavery in the Italians, is almost ineradicable. The fault is worse in Naples than elsewhere in Italy; but <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> everywhere, not merely travellers, but all residents in Italy, must bear witness.|$|E
