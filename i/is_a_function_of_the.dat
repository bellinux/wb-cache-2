5|$|The 8 {{compartment}} Bühlmann - based UWATEC ZH-L8 ADT MB PMG decompression {{model in}} the Scubapro Galileo dive computer processes the dive profile and suggests an intermediate 2-minute stop that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>function</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tissue nitrogen loading at that time, {{taking into account the}} accumulated nitrogen from previous dives. Within the Haldanian logic of the model, at least three compartments are offgassing at the prescribed depth - the 5 and 10 minute half time compartments under a relatively high pressure gradient. Therefore, for decompression dives, the existing obligation is not increased during the stop.|$|E

5|$|The {{combination}} of these two opposite torques creates a resulting yaw torque on the front wheel, and its direction <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>function</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> side-slip angle of the tire, the angle between the actual path of the tire and the direction it is pointing, and the camber angle of the tire (the angle that the tire leans from the vertical).

5|$|New oceanic crust, {{closest to}} the mid-oceanic ridges, is mostly basalt at shallow levels and has a rugged topography. The {{roughness}} of this topography <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>function</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{rate at which the}} mid-ocean ridge is spreading (the spreading rate). Magnitudes of spreading rates vary quite significantly. Typical values for fast-spreading ridges are greater than 100mm/yr, while slow-spreading ridges are typically less than 20mm/yr. Studies have shown that the slower the spreading rate, the rougher the new oceanic crust will be, and vice versa. It is thought this phenomenon is due to faulting at the mid-ocean ridge when the new oceanic crust was formed. These faults pervading the oceanic crust, along with their bounding abyssal hills, are the most common tectonic and topographic features {{on the surface of the}} Earth. The process of seafloor spreading helps to explain the concept of continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|When two proteins' {{distance}} matrices {{share the}} same or similar features in approximately the same positions, they {{can be said to}} have similar folds with similar-length loops connecting their secondary structure elements. DALI's actual alignment process requires a similarity search after the two proteins' distance matrices are built; this is normally conducted via a series of overlapping submatrices of size 6x6. Submatrix matches are then reassembled into a final alignment via a standard score-maximization algorithm— the original version of DALI used a Monte Carlo simulation to maximize a structural similarity score that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>function</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distances between putative corresponding atoms. In particular, more distant atoms within corresponding features are exponentially downweighted to reduce the effects of noise introduced by loop mobility, helix torsions, and other minor structural variations. Because DALI relies on an all-to-all distance matrix, it can account for the possibility that structurally aligned features might appear in different orders within the two sequences being compared.|$|E
