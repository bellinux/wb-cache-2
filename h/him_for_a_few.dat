5|$|Breathitt {{was educated}} {{at home and}} in the public schools of his native state. His family moved to Logan County, Kentucky in 1800, and he {{continued}} his education there. In early adulthood, he was appointed as a deputy surveyor in Illinois Territory. He then returned to Kentucky to teach in a country school. He invested his income in land purchases, and shortly amassed enough wealth to sustain <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years. Financially stable, he resolved to read law under Judge Caleb Wallace. He was admitted to the bar of Russellville, Kentucky in 1810 and opened his practice there.|$|E
5|$|At Bound for Glory, Anderson {{failed in}} his attempt to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship when Jeff Hardy, with Hulk Hogan, and Eric Bischoff's assistance, pinned him in a {{three-way}} match (which also included Kurt Angle) to win the title, ending his partnership with Hardy in the process. On the October 21 edition of Impact!, Anderson was given an opportunity to earn a shot at Hardy and the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Turning Point; {{all he had to do}} was survive an Ultimate X match with Fortune member Kazarian. Kazarian managed to win the match, following interference from his stable mates, but Anderson persevered and thus earned himself a World Heavyweight title shot against Hardy, who attacked him after the match. However, during the attack, Anderson suffered a legitimate concussion, which would sideline <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks and prevented him from taking part in the title match.|$|E
5|$|Following a coup by disgruntled {{military}} officers, Constantine I abdicated for {{a second}} time on 27 September 1922. With several other members of his family, including Queen Olga, he went into exile in Italy and his eldest son succeeded <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months on the throne as George II. Within months, Constantine died in Italy. One of Olga's sons, Prince Andrew, was among those arrested by the new regime. Many defendants in the treason trials that followed the coup were shot, including senior politicians and generals. Foreign diplomats assumed that Andrew was also in mortal danger, and George V of the United Kingdom, Alfonso XIII of Spain, the French president Raymond Poincaré and Pope Pius XI sent representatives to Athens to intercede on his behalf. Andrew, though spared, was banished for life and his family (including the infant Prince Philip, later Duke of Edinburgh and consort of Queen Elizabeth II) fled into exile in December 1922 aboard a British cruiser, HMS Calypso.|$|E

5|$|Later, Charlie finds Liam high on heroin with groupies. Charlie {{kicks the}} groupies out, and tells Liam that he's {{done with the}} band. Liam says to Charlie that he, Liam, is Drive Shaft, and that nobody knows who the bass player (Charlie) is. He goes on to tell Charlie that without the band, Charlie is nothing, which spurs Charlie to use heroin for the first time. Years later, Charlie visits Liam's house in Australia and wants Liam to rejoin Drive Shaft for a {{comeback}} tour. Liam declines, but the band can't do the tour without him. He criticizes Charlie for still using drugs, and Charlie blames Liam for getting him started with drugs. Liam asks Charlie to stay with <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks, saying that Sydney has some good rehab programs and {{that he can get}} Charlie help. Charlie angrily leaves, saying he has a plane to catch.|$|E
25|$|However, {{this did}} not affect RKO's plans for Astaire, first lending <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days to MGM in 1933 for his {{significant}} Hollywood debut, where he appeared as himself dancing with Joan Crawford in the successful musical film Dancing Lady. On his return to RKO, he got fifth billing after fourth billed Ginger Rogers in the 1933 Dolores del Río vehicle Flying Down to Rio. In a review, Variety magazine attributed its massive success to Astaire's presence:The main point of Flying Down to Rio is the screen promise of Fred Astaire... He's assuredly a bet after this one, for he's distinctly likable on the screen, the mike is kind to his voice and as a dancer he remains {{in a class by}} himself. The latter observation will be no news to the profession, which has long admitted that Astaire starts dancing where the others stop hoofing.|$|E
25|$|Yifat finally becomes pregnant. Roi {{has turned}} ultra-orthodox {{and has an}} {{arranged}} marriage. Amir quits {{his job as a}} teacher, finds a new one as Reut's secretary and finally receives a lifelong tuition to study in a seminary. Nati has a new roommate, a poet named Azaria, who was abandoned by his fiancée, Tehila. Nati falls in love with Tehila but cannot convince her to see him for she vowed to remain single until Azaria finds a new partner. Nati encourages Reut to date Azaria, who begins to exploit her for her money. After becoming drunk, he confesses that he does not love her and she abandons him. Tehila starts seeing Nati; he is finally ready to commit and proposes to her, and she seems to accept. Hodaya encounters Avri again. He cancels his own planned wedding and asks her to marry him instead. Hodaya backs off once more, just {{a few days before the}} ceremony, leaving him heartbroken. Amir becomes friends with a boy at his yeshiva and goes to work in a ranch in the Negev with <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks. Hodaya receives a radio show of her own, becomes stressed and quits. Yifat admonishes her for her constant wavering. Tehila speaks with Azaria, and informs Nati they decided to resume their relationship. Nati sinks into depression. Yifat delivers her baby prematurely; Reut and Hodaya stay with her while Nati drives off to fetch Amir. He must stay in the empty ranch while Amir drives back to Jerusalem. Reut comes to bring him back, and they both reconcile while staying in the desert. Hodaya, who heeded Yifat's words, gets her job back and reunites with Avri. Amir and Yifat prepare to take their newborn son home.|$|E

500|$|Orme showed {{great promise}} as a yearling, with trainer John Porter {{saying he had}} great {{expectations}} for him after only having <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months.

500|$|In 1884, Norman {{took over}} the {{management}} of Joseph Merrick, otherwise known as the [...] "Elephant Man", and exhibited <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks until police closed down the show. Merrick later went to live at the London Hospital {{under the care of}} Sir Frederick Treves. In his 1923 memoirs, Treves portrayed Norman as a cruel drunk who ruthlessly exploited his acts. Norman refuted this characterisation and said that he provided Merrick (and his other [...] "freaks") with a means of making money independently. Norman continued a successful career as a showman and later became an auctioneer of novelty shows and circuses.|$|E
2500|$|Ossian Sweet and his wife, Gladys, {{moved into}} the house on September 8, 1925. A group of neighbors in the community, aware of Sweet's {{imminent}} arrival, had vowed to keep blacks out of the neighborhood, stating that they intended to maintain [...] "the present high standards of the neighborhood." [...] Sweet knew of the neighbors' antipathy (telling his brother that he was [...] "prepared to die like a man"), and arranged for some friends and relatives to stay with <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days. He also brought along guns and ammunition.|$|E

2500|$|A {{few years}} later, Latif left Afghanistan for Qadian to meet Ahmad before {{starting}} on the Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca). After having stayed at Qadian with <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> months, {{he returned to}} Afghanistan to proselytise to his King. Upon reaching Khost, he wrote to some courtiers who decided to have him arrested and brought to Kabul. The Emir asked him to renounce his beliefs and recant, but Latif refused. [...] He was then stoned to death before a large crowd. Ahmad's followers claim that Kabul experienced a cholera epidemic within a month of the stoning.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{he is now}} on {{a closer}} social {{standing}} to Blackadder than before, he still receives the same (and possibly more) level of abuse as his Elizabethan ancestor. Blackadder punches him; kicks him; breaks a milk-jug over his head; smashes a huge turnip on his head; roasts <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> minutes on a spit; {{grabs him by the}} shirt collar; threatens to cut him up into strips and tell the prince that he [...] "walked over a very sharp cattle grid in an extremely heavy hat"; and promises five minutes of hellish tortures involving a small pencil, surpassing anything possible from Beelzebub over all eternity. However, he does seem to have a higher level of friendship with Blackadder than the other series.|$|E
2500|$|On 9 April 1998, Mayall {{was injured}} after {{crashing}} a quad bike {{near his home}} in Devon. Mayall's daughter Bonnie and her cousin had asked him to take them for a ride on the bike—a Christmas gift from his wife—but he refused because there was already a spit of rain falling, indicating further rain, and he went on out alone. Mayall remembered nothing about the accident. His mind remained [...] "a total blank." [...] His wife Barbara looked out of the window and saw him lying on the ground trapped beneath the quad, apparently turned over on top of him. Mayall tells the story that his wife believed it was just his silly joking and she initially left <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> minutes. But Mayall was airlifted to Plymouth's Derriford Hospital, with two haematomas and a fractured skull. During the following 96 hours, he was kept sedated to prevent movement which could cause pressure on his brain. His family was warned that he could die or have brain damage. He was in a coma for several days. After five days doctors felt it safe to bring Mayall back to consciousness.|$|E

2500|$|Murat Kurnaz {{was born}} in Bremen, Germany, and grew up there. He was {{considered}} a Turkish citizen because his parents were immigrants, but they had {{lived and worked in}} Germany for years. He was a legal German resident and married a Turkish woman in Germany. In October 2001 Kurnaz at age 19 traveled from Germany to Pakistan, hoping to study at the Mansura Center (which turned him down); he spent the next two months as a tablighi, a Muslim pilgrim sojourning from mosque to mosque. In December 2001, while Kurnaz was on a bus to the airport to return to Germany, Pakistani police at a checkpoint detained him. After questioning <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> days, they [...] turned him over to American soldiers. [...] Later Kurnaz learned that, after its invasion of Afghanistan following the 9/11 attacks, the United States had distributed fliers there and in Pakistan promising “enough money {{to take care of your}} family, your village, your tribe for the rest of your life” as a bounty for suspected terrorists. [...] Kurnaz says [...] "a great number of men wound up in Guantánamo as a result." [...] One of Kurnaz's interrogators at Guantanamo confirmed that he'd been [...] "sold" [...] for a $3,000 bounty.|$|E
2500|$|On October 17, 2016, Bermúdez Zacarías went on {{a morning}} jog nearby his home in Metepec, an upscale exurb [...] outside of Mexico City. As he was {{crossing}} a side {{street in front of}} a private residential neighborhood entrance, a man dressed in black ran up to him from behind and shot him at point-blank range {{in the head with a}} 9 mm pistol. Bermúdez Zacarías was able to turn his head briefly before the gunman delivered the shot in the back of his head. The judge fell to the ground bleeding and curled into fetal position before rolling on his back and spreading his legs and arms. The assassin then ran back and startled a cyclist and a pedestrian before catching up with his accomplice, who was waiting for him from a distance, before fleeing the scene. While Bermúdez Zacarías was on the ground, a car stopped next to <b>him</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> seconds before continuing its course. A second vehicle turned towards the street Bermúdez Zacarías was on, but continued driving inside the residential neighborhood after stopping momentarily. The security guards from the residential neighborhood then called an ambulance. He was transported to Regional Hospital 251 of the Mexican Social Security Institute in Metepec, but doctors confirmed that he died before reaching the hospital. The murder scene was cordoned by the Metepec municipal police, the State of Mexico police, and members of the State of Mexico Attorney General Office. All three law enforcement agencies conducted an investigation at the street where Bermúdez Zacarías was gunned down.|$|E
