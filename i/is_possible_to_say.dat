25|$|The ED {{period is}} the first for which it <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{something}} about the ethnic composition {{of the population of}} Southern Mesopotamia. This {{is due to the fact}} that texts from this period contain sufficient phonetic signs to distinguish separate languages. They also contain personal names, which can potentially be linked to an ethnic identity. The textual evidence suggests that Southern Mesopotamia during the ED period was primarily occupied by Sumerians, who spoke Sumerian (a language isolate). It is still debated whether the Sumerian language was already in use during the Uruk period.|$|E

25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> with a {{high degree}} of {{confidence}} that photographs of three-dimensional objects, including artistic works, will be treated by a court as themselves original artistic works, and as such, will be subject to copyright. It is likely that a photograph (including a scan – digital scanning counts as photography for the purposes of the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988) of a two dimensional artistic work, such as another photograph or a painting will also be subject to copyright if a significant amount of skill, labour and judgment went into its creation.|$|E
2500|$|The most well studied infinitary {{logic is}} [...] In this logic, quantifiers {{may only be}} nested to finite depths, as in first-order logic, but {{formulas}} may have finite or countably infinite conjunctions and disjunctions within them.

2500|$|Similarly, Pope John Paul II {{said of the}} Paul VI {{revision}} of the liturgy: [...] "This work was undertaken {{in accordance with the}} conciliar principles of fidelity to tradition and openness to legitimate development, and so it <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the reform of the Liturgy is strictly traditional and 'in accordance with the ancient usage of the holy Fathers'." ...|$|E

50|$|When ordinal {{utilities}} are used, differences in utils (values taken {{on by the}} utility function) are treated as ethically or behaviorally meaningless: the utility index encodes a full behavioral ordering between members of a choice set, but tells nothing about the related strength of preferences. In the above example, it would only <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that juice <b>is</b> preferred to tea to water, but no more.|$|R

2500|$|In various languages, it is {{seen that}} the verbs {{participating}} in the causative alternation are verbs that denote movement or a change of state or degree. However, not all change of state verbs are anticausatives and therefore, not all change of state verbs participate in the causative alternation. For instance, a change of state verb like 'bloom' does not show causative alternation {{as it is a}} pure unnacusative. It <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that [...] "The cactus bloomed," [...] but it is ungrammatical to say that [...] "The warm weather bloomed the cactus." ...|$|E
2500|$|Much of {{the story}} engages with the {{philosophical}} idealism of George Berkeley, who questioned whether it <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that a thing exists {{if it is not}} being perceived. (Berkeley, a philosopher and, later, a bishop in the Protestant Church of Ireland, resolved that question to his own satisfaction by saying that the omnipresent perception of God ensures that objects continue to exist outside of personal or human perception.) Berkeley's philosophy privileges perceptions over any notion of the [...] "thing in itself." [...] Immanuel Kant accused Berkeley of {{going so far as to}} deny objective reality.|$|E
2500|$|In linguistics, an honorific (abbreviated [...] ) is a {{grammatical}} or morphosyntactic {{form that}} encodes the relative social {{status of the}} participants of the conversation. Distinct from honorific titles, linguistic honorifics convey formality , social distance, politeness , humility , deference, or respect through the choice of an alternate form such as an affix, clitic, grammatical case, change in person or number, or an entirely different lexical item. A key feature of an honorific system is that one can convey the same message in both honorific and familiar forms—i.e., it <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something like (as in an oft-cited example from Brown and Levinson) [...] "The soup is hot" [...] {{in a way that}} confers honor or deference on one of the participants of the conversation.|$|E

60|$|Nowadays it <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> very unorthodox things {{indeed in}} an Anglican pulpit unchallenged. There remains no alert doctrinal {{criticism}} in the church congregations. It was possible, therefore, for the bishop to say all that follows without either hindrance or disturbance. The only opposition, indeed, came from within, {{from a sense of}} dreamlike incongruity between the place and the occasion and the things that he found himself delivering.|$|E
60|$|It is very {{difficult}} to classify THE MAN WHO WAS THURSDAY. It <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that it is a gripping adventure story of murderous criminals and brilliant policemen; but it was to be expected that the author of the Father Brown stories should tell a detective story like no-one else. On this level, therefore, THE MAN WHO WAS THURSDAY succeeds superbly; if nothing else, it is a magnificent tour-de-force of suspense-writing.|$|E
6000|$|... § LXXXIX. In the {{appliance}} of this universal principle {{to what we}} have at present in hand, it is to be noted, that all written or writable law respecting the arts is for the childish and ignorant: that in the beginning of teaching, it <b>is</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that this or that must or must not be done; and laws of color and shade may be taught, as laws of harmony are to the young scholar in music. But the moment a man begins to be anything deserving the name of an artist, all this teachable law has become a matter of course with him; and if, thenceforth, he boast himself anywise in the law, or pretend that he lives and works by it, it is a sure sign that he is merely tithing cummin, and that there is no true art nor religion in him. For the true artist has that inspiration in him which is above all law, or rather, which is continually working out such magnificent and perfect obedience to supreme law, as can in no wise be rendered by line and rule. There are more laws perceived and fulfilled in the single stroke of a great workman, than could be written in a volume. His science is inexpressibly subtle, directly taught him by his Maker, not in any wise communicable or imitable.[23] Neither can any written or definitely observable laws enable us to do any great thing. It is possible, by measuring and administering quantities of color, to paint a room wall so that it shall not hurt the eye; but there are no laws by observing which we can become Titians. It is possible so to measure and administer syllables, as to construct harmonious verse; but there are no laws by which we can write Iliads. Out of the poem or the picture, once produced, men may elicit laws by the volume, and study them with advantage, to the better understanding of the existing poem or picture; but no more write or paint another, than by discovering laws of vegetation they can make a tree to grow. And therefore, wheresoever we find the system and formality of rules much dwelt upon, and spoken of as anything else than a help for children, there we may be sure that noble art is not even understood, far less reached. And thus it was with all the common and public mind in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. The greater men, indeed, broke through the thorn hedges; and, though much time was lost by the learned among them in writing Latin verses and anagrams, and arranging the framework of quaint sonnets and dexterous syllogisms, still they tore their way through the sapless thicket by force of intellect or of piety; for it was not possible that, either in literature or in painting, rules could be received by any strong mind, so as materially to interfere with its originality: and the crabbed discipline and exact scholarship became an advantage to the men who could pass through and despise them; so that in spite of the rules of the drama we had Shakspeare, and in spite of the rules of art we had Tintoret,--both of them, to this day, doing perpetual violence to the vulgar scholarship and dim-eyed proprieties of the multitude.|$|E

From which, it could <b>be</b> <b>possible</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the peak in the sample represents ethanol.|$|R
