Recent research by McGraw, Larsen, Kahneman and Schkade (2010) revealed that the occurrence of loss aversion relies on psychological measures and scales. Specifically, loss aversion was present only {{when there was a}} possibility for comparing losses and gains directly (employing unipolar scales) – contextual comparability. Previous studies, however, explored the variation of risky preferences as a function of psychological comparability (Stewart, Chater & Brown, 2006; Kusev, van Schaik,Ayton, Dent & Chater, 2009; Kusev & van Schaik, 2011). Experiment one was designed to test loss aversion for judgements of feelings with non-monetary and monetary, unipolar and bipolar scales. We found that the mismatch (non-comparability) between perceived decision scenario and judged <b>decision</b> <b>content</b> eliminates loss aversion. Experiment two further explored the psychological comparability hypothesis by controlling for levels of comparability between perceived decision scenario and judged <b>decision</b> <b>content.</b> The results revealed inconsistent loss aversion; psychological comparability (between perceived decision scenario and evaluated <b>decision</b> <b>content)</b> and not contextual comparisons fuelled loss averse judgement...|$|E

Specifically that gain and loss expected judgements, {{in response to a}} mixed monetary gamble, are processed in isolation (bipolar scales) and do not induce decision biases. However, when the judgement options are forced into the same contextual space (unipolar scales), prompting direct comparisons, they induce loss-averse judgements.

40|$|A commonly-held view of Supreme Court {{decision-making}} is {{that the}} median justice on the Court controls the content of opinions. This view rests on an application of median voter theorem – typically applied to legislative decision-making or party positioning – in the judicial context.

In particular, judges simultaneously vote on an outcome (the judgment) and sign onto a rationale (the opinion). We demonstrate that if judicial preferences across these two aspects of a case are discontinuous – that is, if justices do not switch their vote on the outcome in exchange for concessions on rationale – the median justice typically does not determine the content of Supreme Court decisions.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} provide an {{explanation}} for the contents of three foreign policy decisions implemented under the government of general Ernesto Geisel (1974 - 79). It does so by analyzing the decision-making process which led Brazil l) to abstain in the Meetings of Consultation of American Foreign Ministers for voting the lifting of sanctions against Cuba; 2) to restore diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China; and 3) to recognize Angola's MPLA government. The central hypothesis of the thesis is that, although the doctrine of the regime (National Security Doctrine/NSD) has shaped the general conduct of the government, {{it is not enough to}} explain the changes in the main lines of foreign policy. It is necessary to analyze the decision making arena where those changes were indeed defined. The first part of the thesis seeks to review the literature on Brazilian foreign policy under the military regime and to present the perspective of analysis. Then the origins and contents of the NSD, in particular its external components, are presented. In addition, it aims to describe the general structure of the decision making arena under Geisel's government, and the main aspects of the foreign policy implemented during this administration. The following three chapters then seek to reconstruct the decision-making process aiming to retrieve from the analysis of the bargains among the bureaucratic role-players, the meaningful elements of the <b>decision</b> <b>contents.</b> The conclusion then claims that it was President Geisel's leadership, along with his Foreign Minister, which was able to oust the "ideological frontiers" precept from the core of the NSD, in spite of its admitted importance during the Cuban case. Furthermore it disputes the premise which states that the existence of a given ultimate consensus among the decision-makers based on the Doctrine is able to explain, on domestic grounds, the foreign policy of "Responsible Pragmatism". It does so by maintaining that the way whereby a new consensus around foreign policy was developed within the decision making arena is, in itself, a crucial element in understanding the <b>decision</b> <b>contents...</b>|$|R

We compared the risks taken for precautionary decisions with those taken for equivalent monetary gambles.

This result indicates a failure of the descriptive invariance axiom of expected utility theory. For precautionary decisions, people overweighted small, medium-sized, and moderately large probabilities-they exaggerated risks. This effect is not anticipated by prospect theory or experience-based decision research (Hertwig, Barron, Weber, & Erev, 2004). We found evidence that exaggerated risk is caused by the accessibility of events in memory: The weighting function varies {{as a function of the}} accessibility of events.

40|$|This {{research}} compared {{decision making}} processes in six Chinese state-owned enterprises {{during the period}} 1985 to 1988. The research objectives were: a) To examine changes in the managerial behaviour {{over a period of}} 1985 to 1988 with a focus on decision-making; b) Through this examination, to throw light on the means by which government policies on economic reform were implemented at the enterprise level; c) To illustrate problems encountered in the decentralization programme which was a major part of China's economic reform. The research was conducted by means of intensive interviews with more than eighty managers and a survey of documents relating to specific decisions. A total of sixty cases of decision-making were selected from five decision topics: purchasing of inputs, pricing of outputs, recruitment of labour, organizational change and innovation, which occurred in 1985 (or before) and in 1988 / 89. Data from the interviews were used to investigate environmental conditions, relations between the enterprise and its higher authority, interactions between management and the party system, the role of information, and effectiveness of regulations and government policies on enterprise management. The analysis of the data indicates that the decision processes in the different enterprises have some similarities in regard to actor involvement, the flow of decision activities, interactions with the authorities, information usage and the effect of regulations. Comparison of the same or similar decision contents over time indicates that the achievement of decentralization varied according to the topic of decision. Managerial authority was delegated to enterprises when the authorities relaxed their control over resource allocation. When acquisition of necessary resources is dependent upon the planning system or the decision matter is sensitive, because it involves change to the institutional framework (e. g. the Party), then a high degree of centralization was retained, resulting in a marginal change in managerial behaviour. The economic reform failed to increase decision efficiency and effectiveness of decision-making. The prevailing institutional frameworks were regarded as negative to the change. The research argues that the decision process is likely to be more contingent on the <b>decision</b> <b>content</b> than the organization. Three types of decision process have been conceptualized, each of them related to a certain type of <b>decision</b> <b>content.</b> This argument gives attention to the perspectives of institution and power in a way which facilitates an elaboration of organizational analysis.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of decision-makers'culture on their {{implicit}} choice of how to make decisions. In a content analysis of major decisions described in American and Chinese twentieth-century novels, we test a series of hypotheses based on prior theoretical and empirical investigations of cross-cultural variation in human motivation and decision processes. The data show a striking degree of cultural similarity in the relationships between <b>decision</b> <b>content,</b> situational characteristics and the decision mode(s) employed, but also support several hypotheses about cultural differences. As predicted, Chinese decision-makers more frequently used role-based logic (a form of recognition-based decision-making) to arrive at decisions, {{by virtue of their}} greater awareness of and need for relational obligations. The hypothesis (based on conjectures about Chinese thinking style and personality differences) that Chinese decision-makers would show more rule- and case-based decision-making (two other variants of recognition-based decision-making) than decision-makers in American novels was also supported. After controlling for other predictor variables, there also was support for the hypothesis (based on comparative analyses of Chinese and Western philosophy) that analytic modes which base decisions on the calculation of best consequences would be used less frequently by Chinese decision-makers. There was no evidence of greater prevention focus in Chinese decisions. These and other observed cultural similarities and differences in the dynamics of decision mode selection have implications for the study and practice of decision-making in managerial settings.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Background: Decision {{aids are}} {{structures}} education packages designed to foster {{shared decision making}} between patient physician. They are often used when there is confusion or disagreement associated with the values patients assigned to, and the evidence on, the various outcomes of the intervention in question. Blood transfusion relation to elective surgery {{is an area that}} requires both physicians and patients to carefully consider different treatment options. The issues of variation in transfusion practices, different personal values in regards to receiving blood, and the uncertainty as to whether the benefits of technologies aimed at minimising allogeneic blood use (e. g. pre-operative autologous donation or PAD) outweigh the potential harms justify attempts to design a patient decision aid in this area. Aims: The overall aim of the thesis was to develop and pilot test a decision aid describing blood transfusion options to patients planning any type of major elective surgery (such as hip replacement or heart bypass). A series of studies and reviews were necessary to adequately inform the development of the decision aid. Hence, additional aims of the thesis were: to investigate whether the manner in which treatment effects are presented influence the healthcare decisions made by patients (information framing).; To systematically review the evidence on the benefits and harms of PAD (e. g. need for allogeneic/autologous blood, other clinical outcomes).; To examine the attitudes, beliefs, understanding and possible misconceptions of the general public, patients, special interest group members (e. g. Hepatitis C Council), and physicians regarding blood transfusion. Methods: The following studies were undertaken to inform the development of the decision aid: a systematic review and meta-analysis exploring the impact of information framing on patient treatment decision making; a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled observational studies on PAD; and a survey (administered as a computer assisted telephone interview) of the views and opinions of physicians, patients, patients, and the public about blood transfusion. Decision aid development was guided by the Ottawa Decision Support Framework. The initial evaluation stages involved drafting and re-drafting the <b>decision</b> <b>content</b> by a group of experts in the fields of haematology, internal medicine, epidemiology, and health psychology. The final draft of the decision aid was reviewed by health professionals and patients who were about to have or had recently undergone major elective surgery. Participants provided feedback on its acceptability and identified areas for improvement during a semi-structures telephone interview. The decision aid was also quality assessed using the CREDIBLE criteria. Results: The results of a systematic review on information framing indicated that numerical data should be presented in {{more than one way to}} ensure patients form an accurate perception of treatment worth. In general, surgical and medical treatments tended to be preferred when information was expressed in a survival (positive) frame compared to a mortality (negative) frame, or when expressed as relative risk reduction (RRR) as opposed to absolute risk reduction (ARR) or number needed to treat (NNT) frames. The systematic review of controlled observational studies on PAD produced similar results to those from randomised controlled trials: PAD statistically significantly decreased the need for allogeneic blood yet increased the likelihood of receiving any transfusion (allogeneic/autologous) compared to usual care. Most studies (75 %) did not use a transfusion protocol and seven studies reported using a more liberal protocol for the transfusion of autologous blood compared to allogeneic blood. Due to the paucity of research examining other clinical outcomes such as infection and thrombosis, there is insufficient data to determine the impact PAD may have on these outcomes. In surveys with patients, special interest group members and the public, one-third of respondents voiced concern with receiving an allogeneic blood transfusion, and most respondents overestimated the probability of contracting HIV and HCV through a blood transfusion when compared to other events of equal risk (e. g. being struck by lightning). Approximately 80 % of respondents preferred PAD due to the perception that it eliminated all risks associated with a blood transfusion, is 100 % compatible, and that it helps others through contributing to the blood supply. Although approximately half of the physicians interviewed used a transfusion trigger or protocol, individual patient characteristics were the main factor driving the decision of whether to transfuse. However, some respondents were critical of those who either did (or did not) use protocols, while others modified the "science of the guidelines" according to the needs of the individual. The final draft of the decision aid asked patients to consider the point at which they would prefer to receive a blood transfusion after major elective surgery (using haemoglobin values or transfusion "triggers" as a guide) and to decide whether or not to use PAD. The decision aid, "Blood Transfusion Options for Planned Surgery: A Decision Aid for Patients", consisted of a 32 -page A 5 size booklet and 28 -minute audio tape or CD. The decision aid included the following sections: information about blood and blood loss; facts about blood transfusions; blood transfusions an you; your transfusion preference after surgery; approaches to replacing blood less; the differences between volunteer-donated and self-donated blood; adverse effects of blood transfusion; frequently asked questions; steps in decision making; and scientific references. A decision slip was included at the back of the booklet for patients to complete and return to their surgeon. Patients felt that the decision aid removed fears and common misconceptions associated with blood transfusion by providing them with more knowledge and realistic expectations of transfusion risks. Importantly, health professionals and patients felt that the information in the decision aid was presented in a balanced way and that it did not coerce patients to choose one particular option over another. Pilot data revealed that although the decision aid was generally well received, a number of revisions will be required before successful implementation. Important changes include; updating all information for recency; providing better explanations of numerical data; reducing the amount of information where appropriate; tailoring the decision aid for use in orthapaedic surgery (due to reduced utilisation rates of PAD); and clarifying the role of transfusion triggers in the decision aid, including whether it is appropriate to involved patients in that stage of the decision making process. The format of the decision aid also needs to be reconsidered (i. e. computer-based or continue with print and audio material) as costs and time restraints were highlighted as potential barriers to its use in practice. Based on the CREDIBLE criteria, the decision aid requires an updating policy, accessible documentation of the development process, and formal evaluation using a before-after pilot-study/randomised controlled trial. Conclusion: The task of developing and evaluating a decision aid on blood transfusion was found to be very complex and demanding. For instance, a number of in-depth studies were needed to adequately inform decision aid development and the decision aid still requires formal evaluation. However, the findings from the research undertaken in the thesis also reinforced the need for a decision aid on blood transfusion - the evidence on the benefits and harms of blood transfusion and PAD is controversial, practice variation exists, and personal values influenced patient and physician views of blood transfusion and PAD. Despite receiving positive feedback from health professionals and patients, the decision aid requires some significant modifications. Reduced utilisation rates of PAD indicate that a generic decision aid for procedures other than major orthopaedic surgery may not be relevant in practice. Although the issues surrounding blood transfusion justify the need for a decision aid, the desire for both patients and physicians for limited patient involvement regarding the decision of when to give a blood transfusion (using transfusion triggers as a guide) suggests that the aims of the decision aid in this area need to be reconsidered. However, as the number of older Australians undergoing major elective surgery rises due to population ageing, the availability of decision aids that adequately inform patients of the benefits and harms of blood transfusion and the option of PAD will be imperative. With further revision and evaluation, this decision aid should fulfill its promise as an effective tool for education patients about blood transfusion...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the determinants of SPMS disclosures by examining whether significant relationships exist between voluntary SPMS disclosure practice and various corporate characteristics including profitability, age, size and industry. It also aims to explore whether uncertainty in the business environment arising from the onset of the global financial crisis may affect disclosure <b>decisions.</b> <b>Content</b> analysis of publicly available data is conducted focusing on the Top 100 publicly listed firms in Australia. Logistic regressions are used to test the hypotheses developed based on the predictions from voluntary disclosure and socio-political theories. The results show that firm age, size and industry prominence are significantly related to SPMS disclosures. However, the suggestion that business uncertainty may affect SPMS disclosures is not supported...|$|R

We find that when group members make an anonymous individual decision {{on whether or not}} to contribute to the group success, within-group cheap talk communication significantly reduces miscoordination and free-riding. To measure how much miscoordination remains when communication is allowed, we employ a control treatment where we remove coordination and free-riding incentives by having group members reach a unanimous group decision on how much to contribute. We find that group level contributions are not significantly different in the two cases. Communication therefore completely eliminates miscoordination and free-riding within groups and leads group members to act as one agent in making <b>decisions.</b> <b>Content</b> analysis of group communication reveals that groups explicitly designate specific contributors following a rotation scheme and they understand the essence of implementing mixed strategy equilibrium.
