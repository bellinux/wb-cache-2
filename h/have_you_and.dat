While {{he is in his}} bedroom, she snoops around and finds a woman's dressing robe in his closet. She then notices a photograph of Gil and Sara together on the fridge. When Grissom emerges from his room, she asks him [...] "How long <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> Sara been together?" [...] He tries to make a quick exit but not before she tells him she'd always thought he was a lonely bachelor, to which his response is to laugh and leave.|$|E

[...] "I never figured out who 'Heath Ledger' is on film: 'This is what you expect when you hire me, {{and it will be}} recognizable'... People always feel compelled to sum you up, to presume that they <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> can describe you. That's fine. But there are so many stories inside of me and a lot I want to achieve outside of one flat note." ...|$|E
2500|$|The idea to base {{the album}} around the {{folklore}} {{concept of the}} seventh son of a seventh son came to bassist Steve Harris after he read Orson Scott Card's Seventh Son. Harris states, [...] "It was our seventh studio album and I didn't have a title for it or any ideas at all. Then I read {{the story of the}} seventh son, this mystical figure that was supposed to have all these paranormal gifts, like second sight and what <b>have</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> it was more, at first, that it was just a good title for the seventh album, you know? But then I rang [...] and started talking about it and the idea just grew." ...|$|E

2500|$|Explaining the {{decision}} to start the series with the teenagers as juniors, Schwahn said, [...] "Lucas and Nathan were important players on the [...] team, the most important, and I just couldn't see that happening to freshmen." [...] He also {{wanted to keep the}} characters in high school longer, saying, [...] "I know a lot of the shows that we started with, the kids are out of high school now and into college and what <b>have</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> I always thought that there was a loss of energy when that happened. It's hard to have everyone go to the same college and everyone stay together for whatever reason, or you lose some of your principles." [...] Schwahn wanted to reinvigorate the show. [...] "The show in many ways has been refaced and reinvigorated. It's very much a twenty-something show now with some relevant adult characters, and I really like that energy for the show," [...] he said, and elaborated: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1958, Crews {{joined the}} UC Berkeley English Department, where he taught for 36 years before {{retiring}} as its chair in 1994. Crews was an anti-war activist from 1965 to about 1970 and advocated draft resistance as co-chair of Berkeley’s Faculty Peace Committee. Though he shared the widespread assumption during the mid-1960s that psychoanalytic theory was a valid account of human motivation {{and was one}} of the first academics to apply that theory systematically to the study of literature, Crews gradually came to regard psychoanalysis as a pseudoscience. This convinced him that his loyalty should not belong to any theory but rather to empirical standards and the skeptical point of view. Throughout his career, Crews has brought his concern for rational discourse to the study of various issues, from the controversy over recovered memory, the credibility of the Rorschach test, and belief in alien abductions to the Theosophical Society, creationism, and “intelligent design.” He has also advocated for clear writing based on standards of sound argument and rhetorical effectiveness rather than adherence to rigid school-book rules. “What interests me is general rationality,” said Crews,General rationality requires us to observe the world carefully, to consider alternative hypotheses to our own hypotheses, to gather evidence in a responsible way, to answer objections. These are habits of mind that science shares with good history, good sociology, good political science, good economics, what <b>have</b> <b>you.</b> <b>And</b> I summarize all this in what I call the [...] "empirical attitude." [...] It's a combination of feeling responsible to the evidence that is available, feeling responsible to go out and find that evidence, including the evidence that is contrary to one's presumptions, and responsibility to be logical with one's self and others. And this is an ideal that is not so much individual as social. The rational attitude doesn't really work when simply applied to one's self. It is something that we owe to each other.|$|E
