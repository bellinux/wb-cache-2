5|$|Shortly {{before the}} French Revolution, dishes like bouchées la Reine gained prominence. Essentially royal cuisine {{produced}} by the royal household, this is a chicken-based recipe served on vol-au-vents created {{under the influence of}} Queen Marie Leszczyńska, the wife of Louis XV. This recipe is still popular today, as are other recipes from Queen Marie Leszczyńska like consommé la Reine and <b>filet</b> d'aloyau braisé à la royale. Queen Marie is also credited with introducing lentils to the French diet.|$|E
5|$|Plante {{also wrote}} {{extensively}} on hockey. He wrote hockey columns starting {{early in his}} career and was published in La Voix de Shawinigan, Le Samedi, and Sport Magazine. He alienated local reporters by writing a column for the local paper during his time as coach of the Quebec Nordiques. His seminal work, Goaltending, was published in 1972 in English, with the French edition (entitled Devant le <b>filet)</b> published in 1973. In his book, Plante outlined a program of goaltender development that included off-ice exercises, choice of equipment, styles of play, and game-day preparation. He also advised on best coaching methods for both young and advanced goaltenders. His book remained popular with coaches and players and was reprinted in both French and English in 1997, 25years after it was first published.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the demographic trend of longer lifespans and an expanding older market, and to its child-centered image, McDonald's {{made a conscious decision}} to attempt to market its food to a more adult audience. Rather than change its existing menu items or marketing strategy, the company decided to create a new line of sandwiches with what would hopefully be perceived as more sophisticated ingredients.

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} detect {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOCs) during spoilage of chicken breast <b>filets</b> under modified atmosphere packaging (MAP, (70 % O 2; 30 % CO 2)). Storage tests were conducted at 6 °C in a household refrigerator. Measurements were made using untreated chicken breast <b>filets</b> and using <b>filets</b> inoculated with either Pseudomonas fluorescens or Escherichia coli bacteria. The gas space above the sample was adsorbed once a day on Tenax® TA and analyzed using thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD-GC/MS). During storage, 60 {{volatile organic compounds}} of hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, ethers, and sulfur-containing compounds were detected. It was shown {{that the presence of}} most hydrocarbons and aldehydes declined during storage time, whereas most of the alcohols, ketones, sulfur-containing compounds, esters, and ethers increased. Some of these detected VOCs could act as indicators to describe the freshness loss of the product. The best spoilage markers for spoiled chicken breast <b>filets</b> under MAP were 2 -methyl- 1 -propanol, 2 -methyl- 1 -butanol, 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol, 3 -hydroxy- 2 -butanone, ethyl acetate, 2 -butanone, and sulfur-containing compounds...|$|R

Ben through a curve ball half way through the challenge and expected a poached egg from each challenger. Fenton went all out and attempted a damper similar to a <b>filet</b> mignon wrapped in bacon. Coconut hotcakes with balsamic glazed fruit and a chipolata rolled in an egg net. Jason's plate was also distinguished, although his egg turned out brown due to the new wok and acidic lime juice. Jason's food was presented best but it was Fenton's big personality that won over the judges and earned {{a place in the}} top 10.|$|E

40|$|Fish-borne {{illness is}} {{associated}} with pathogenic bacteria, Vibrio spp., transmitted from contaminated aquaculture water to fish. But {{little is known about}} the correlation between water quality in aquaculture and subsequent bacterial contamination in fish products. The degree of bacterial transmission from Vibrio spp. contaminated aquaculture water to fish was investigated. V. anguillarum, V. parahaemolyticus, and V. vulnificus were administered to aquaculture water and the amounts of Vibrio spp. and total bacteria in the aquaculture water and fish <b>filets</b> were assessed using a multiplex real-time PCR assay. Following the challenge, the counts of total bacteria and Vibrio spp. simultaneously increased in both the water and fish <b>filets</b> with levels of bacteria in the fish directly proportional to that in the water. The total bacterial population in the water decreased to pre-challenge levels over time. However, Vibrio spp. counts in fish <b>filets</b> were nearly unchanged during the same time period. There is a strong correlation between the amount of bacteria that are present in aquaculture waters and those that can be observed in the subsequent fish muscle tissue. In addition, the numbers of Vibrio spp. in the random sampled aquaculture fish <b>filets</b> were highly associated with the levels in the aquaculture water. Consequently, populations of total bacteria and Vibrio spp. in aquaculture water is highly correlated with bacterial number of aquacultured fish product, therefore the surveillance of Vibrio populations in the aquaculture water could be an indicator of the microbial contaminations of fish <b>filets...</b>|$|R
