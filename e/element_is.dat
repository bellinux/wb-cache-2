Relative positioning means that the web developer specifies an X and Y offset from the usual position of the element. Fixed positioning means that the <b>element</b> <b>is</b> placed relative to the browser window, and scrolls with the window rather than {{with the rest of}} the page.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the name Glastonbury is unclear but when the {{settlement}} is first recorded in the 7th and the early 8th century, it was called Glestingaburg. The burg <b>element</b> <b>is</b> Anglo-Saxon and could refer either to a fortified place such as a burh or, more likely, a monastic enclosure; however the Glestinga <b>element</b> <b>is</b> obscure, and may derive from an Old English word or from a Saxon or Celtic personal name. It may derive from a person or kindred group named Glast.|$|E

5|$|Chromium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Cr and atomic number 24. It {{is the first}} element in group 6. It is a steely-grey, lustrous, hard and brittle metal which takes a high polish, resists tarnishing, and has a high melting point. The name of the <b>element</b> <b>is</b> derived from the Greek word χρῶμα, chrōma, meaning color, because many chromium compounds are intensely colored.|$|E
5|$|Dalton {{proposed}} that each chemical <b>element</b> <b>is</b> composed of atoms of a single, unique type, {{and though they}} cannot be altered or destroyed by chemical means, they can combine to form more complex structures (chemical compounds). This marked the first truly scientific theory of the atom, since Dalton reached his conclusions by experimentation and examination of the results in an empirical fashion.|$|E

5|$|For 80 of the {{chemical}} elements, at least one stable isotope exists.

Elements 43, 61, and all elements numbered 83 or higher have no stable isotopes.|$|E
5|$|In nature, cobalt is {{frequently}} associated with nickel, {{and both are}} characteristic components of meteoric iron, though cobalt is much less abundant in iron meteorites than nickel. As with nickel, cobalt in meteoric iron alloys may have been well enough protected from oxygen and moisture to remain as the free (but alloyed) metal, though neither <b>element</b> <b>is</b> seen in that form in the ancient terrestrial crust.|$|E

Straight tapering fluted legs joined by a block at the seat rail and architectural mouldings, characterize the style, in which each <b>element</b> <b>is</b> a discrete entity. Louis Delanois, Jean-Claude Sené and Georges Jacob were three leading chairmakers in the 1770s and 80s.|$|E

Zinc is a chalcophile, meaning the element has a low affinity for oxides and prefers to bond with sulfides.

Sphalerite, which {{is a form of}} zinc sulfide, is the most heavily mined zinc-containing ore because its concentrate contains 60–62% zinc.|$|E

5|$|There are few {{surviving}} {{records of}} Blackstone's undergraduate term at Oxford, but the curriculum of Pembroke College {{had been set}} out in 1624, and Prest notes that it was probably still followed in 1738, so Blackstone would have studied Greek, science, logic, rhetoric, philosophy, mathematics, geography and poetry. Blackstone was particularly good at Greek, mathematics and poetry, with his notes on William Shakespeare being included in George Steevens' 1781 edition of Shakespeare's plays. Many of Blackstone's undergraduate texts survive, and they include few legal texts, instead being wide-ranging; politics, current affairs, poetry, geometry and controversial theological texts.
