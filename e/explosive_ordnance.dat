5|$|Near the Canadian {{side of the}} {{restored}} trenches is a small memorial plaque dedicated to Lieutenant-Colonel Mike Watkins MBE. Watkins was head of <b>Explosive</b> <b>Ordnance</b> Disposal at the Directorate of Land Service Ammunition, Royal Logistic Corps, and a leading British <b>explosive</b> <b>ordnance</b> disposal expert. In August 1998, he died in a roof collapse near a tunnel entrance while undertaking a detailed investigative survey of the British tunnel system {{on the grounds of}} the Canadian National Vimy Memorial site. Watkins was no stranger to the tunnel system at Vimy Ridge. Earlier the same year, he participated in the successful disarming of 3 tonnes of deteriorated ammonal explosives located under a road intersection on the site.|$|E

5|$|Beryllium is non-magnetic. Therefore, tools {{fabricated}} out of beryllium-based {{materials are}} used by naval or military <b>explosive</b> <b>ordnance</b> disposal teams for work on or near naval mines, since these mines commonly have magnetic fuzes. They are also found in maintenance and construction materials near magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines {{because of the high}} magnetic fields generated. In the fields of radio communications and powerful (usually military) radars, hand tools made of beryllium are used to tune the highly magnetic klystrons, magnetrons, traveling wave tubes, etc., that are used for generating high levels of microwave power in the transmitters.|$|E
5|$|Many years later, in September 2002, {{one of the}} unexploded torpedoes that U-47 {{had fired}} during the attack on Royal Oak rose to the surface from its resting place on the bottom. The unexploded torpedo, minus its warhead, {{gradually}} drifted towards the shore, where it was spotted by a crewman aboard the Norwegian tanker Petrotrym. A Royal Navy tugboat intercepted the torpedo, and after identifying it as having belonged to U-47 63 years earlier, EOD (<b>explosive</b> <b>ordnance</b> disposal) personnel discarded it a mile from shore.|$|E

He was promoted to lieutenant in 1973. Having graduated as a Bachelor of Science in 1975, he served a tour with 22 Air Defence Regiment, Royal Artillery, with responsibility for the regiment's new Rapier missiles.

5|$|The 1st Sustainment Brigade (1SB) in {{garrison}} at Fort Riley {{is composed}} of four subordinate battalions. The 1st Special Troops Battalion (STB) contains a Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC), 267th Signal Company, and the 24th Transportation Company. The 1st STB and the 541st Combat Sustainment Support Battalion are permanently assigned to the 1SB. The 1SB has an Administrative Control Minus (ADCON-) Training and Readiness (TRA) relationship with the 84th <b>Explosive</b> <b>Ordnance</b> Disposal (EOD) Battalion and the 1st Infantry Division Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion (1DHHB). Thanks to the brigade's modular design, it is also capable of gaining additional subordinate units upon deployment to a theater of operations.|$|E
5|$|After Point Grey and Point Orient {{were turned}} over to the RVN on 14 July only Point Cypress and Point Marone were left in Division 13. On that day the {{remaining}} two cutters were given orders to report to the lower Mekong Delta and provide support for operations in the Than Phu Secret Zone. On 19 and 20 July the crews of both cutters consisted of a full complement of 13 RVN sailors and 5 Coast Guardsmen including the commanding officers. Kit Carson Scouts were also embarked, making the decks very crowded. The Scouts were put ashore on a search and destroy mission and the cutters backed them up with gunfire from their decks and the cutter small boats. The raid was successful, netting several captured Viet Cong troops and boxes of documents. A week later both cutters with Australian Army <b>explosive</b> <b>ordnance</b> disposal soldiers aboard cruised the My Thanh River and destroyed fortifications.|$|E
5|$|Tomić {{was ordered}} to form an aerial unit of the Šumadija Division on 16 August. On 22 October, {{he became the first}} Serbian pilot to face enemy {{anti-aircraft}} fire when his Blériot XI was targeted by Austro-Hungarian field batteries. The first Serbian escadrille was formed in Belgrade the same day. Tomić went on to participate in multiple combat missions, dropping <b>explosive</b> <b>ordnance</b> on Austro-Hungarian military positions and supply lines. In May 1915, a number of French pilots came to Serbia to help the country's war effort. Tomić was assigned to Požarevac airfield following the arrival of the French and flew missions over the Banat. A soldier named Milutin Mihailović was assigned to fly with him as a military observer. On 9 June, Tomić downed one German plane. Six days later, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant. He shot down another German plane on 23 June. In total, Tomić and Mihailović flew nineteen combat missions over the Banat between early May and late August 1915.|$|E

More recently it has been part of 33 Engineer Regiment (EOD). The latter is a hybrid unit, containing both Regular and Reserve subunits. 217 Squadron is based at Ilford in London and Southend-on-Sea in Essex.

40|$|As research, development, test, {{acquisition}} and evaluation (RDTA&E) of unmanned systems experiences increased attention by the Department of Defense (DoD), {{elements within the}} acquisition community are responding by mapping out changes to management systems, including fundamental policy shifts, to support the expanding role of robots on the battlefield.
