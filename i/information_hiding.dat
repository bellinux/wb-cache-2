25|$|The {{rise of the}} {{structured}} programming movement led to many other structured approaches applied to software design. The techniques of structured analysis and structured design are outgrowths of {{structured programming}} concepts and techniques, and of the early ideas about modular design. Principles of modularity were strengthened by Larry Constantine's concepts of coupling (to be minimized between modules) and cohesion (to be maximized within modules), by David Parnas's techniques of <b>information</b> <b>hiding,</b> and by abstract data types. A number of tools and methods employing structured concepts were developed, such as Structured Design, Jackson's Structured Programming, Ross' Structured Analysis and Design Technique (SADT), Yourdon's Structured Method, Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM), and James Martin's Information Engineering. The field of software metrics is often considered as a direct influence of the structured programming movement on software engineering in the 1970s.|$|E

Felten withdrew the presentation from the workshop, reading a brief statement about the threats instead. SDMI and other copyright holders denied that they had ever threatened to sue Felten.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a best approach for Least Significant Bit (LSB) based on image steganography that enhances the existing LSB substitution techniques {{to improve the}} security level of <b>hidden</b> <b>information.</b> It is {{a new approach to}} substitute LSB of RGB true color image. The new security conception <b>hides</b> secret <b>information</b> within the LSB of image where a secret key encrypts the <b>hidden</b> <b>information</b> to protect it from unauthorized users. In general, in LSB methods, <b>hidden</b> <b>information</b> is stored into a specific position of LSB of image. For this reason, knowing the retrieval methods, anyone can extract the <b>hidden</b> <b>information.</b> In our paper, <b>hidden</b> <b>information</b> is stored into different position of LSB of image depending on the secret key. As a result, it is difficult to extract the <b>hidden</b> <b>information</b> knowing the retrieval methods.

40|$|Abstract — Steganography is {{the process}} of hiding a secret message within a larger one {{in such a way that}} someone cannot know the {{presence}} or contents of the hidden message. The purpose of Steganography is to protect the <b>hidden</b> <b>information</b> from the outside world and the security will increase if the secret information can’t be retrieved even if the attacker has the idea of embedding method. The proposed technique is a new approach which is a combination of region based edge adaptive LSB steganography with Huffman coding. In this method some pixels of secret <b>information</b> are <b>hidden</b> in the edge pixels of RGB colour image in each of the three colour components by performing XOR on least significant two bits of edge pixels and other pixels of the secret <b>information</b> are <b>hidden</b> in the LSB of non-edge pixels. As a result it is difficult to retrieve the <b>hidden</b> <b>information</b> because the <b>hidden</b> <b>information</b> is kept in two different categories of pixels. It has been shown by the experimental results that the quality of image is not degraded even after the addition of secret data...|$|R
