5|$|I {{certainly}} don't see gay {{and lesbian}} history starting with Stonewall... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to <b>have</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> call a point of origin... it's more complex than saying that {{it all started with}} Stonewall.|$|E
500|$|He {{has worked}} as a concept {{designer}} on films, including Watchmen, Star Trek, , Cloverfield, and Avatar. Cloverfield director Matt Reeves noted they hired Page to design the [...] "creature" [...] that appears in the film, commenting, [...] "We would go into his office and he would <b>have</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> affectionately referred to as his 'Wall of Terror.' On the wall were all sorts of bits of color, and as you got closer suddenly your interest turned to revulsion because those pictures were like pictures of intestines and eyeballs and pieces of animals. What he was doing was having a biological, evolutionary basis for every aspect of the creature." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{was this}} huge scandal that {{originally}} [...] "Halo" [...] {{was meant to}} go to Leona. That was never the case... That song was written for Beyoncé. What happened was that Beyoncé waited long enough to record that song... I thought {{this would be a}} brilliant first single for Leona, which it would <b>have...</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> did was foolishly say to Leona's camp, [...] "I have it on hold for another A-list artist and I'm pretty sure they'll take it, but if they don't, I just {{want to know if you}} like it enough to consider it". I sent it to them and they flipped on it. They loved it and instantly said they wanted to do it. I was like, [...] "Wait, wait, wait, no, it's not free yet!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Until {{you spoke}} to Estella the other day, and until I saw in you a looking-glass that showed me <b>what</b> <b>I</b> once felt myself, I did not know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done. <b>What</b> <b>have</b> <b>I</b> done! <b>What</b> <b>have</b> <b>I</b> done! ...|$|R

500|$|Notorious {{scenes in}} the play include [...] "the china scene", a {{sustained}} double entendre dialogue mostly heard from off stage, where Horner is purportedly discussing his china collection {{with two of his}} lady friends. The husband of Lady Fidget and the grandmother of Mrs. Squeamish are listening front stage and nodding in approval, failing to pick up the double meaning which is obvious to the audience. Lady Fidget has already explained to her husband that Horner [...] "knows china very well, and has himself very good, but will not let me see it lest I should beg some. But I will find it out, and <b>have</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> came for yet" [...] (IV.iii.110). Dialogue such as this made [...] "china" [...] a dirty word in common conversation, Wycherley later claimed.|$|E
500|$|When Liz tells Tracy {{that he has}} a {{life with}} his family and should enjoy it, after Tracy tries to have sex with her in order to restore his womanizing reputation, she tells him [...] "You know what I have? A Sims family that keeps getting murdered." [...] The Sims is a video game in which players create virtual people called [...] "Sims" [...] and places them in houses and helps direct their moods and satisfy their desires. Tracy {{responds}} [...] "One day, you will <b>have</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have because you are an amazing, strong, intelligent woman, like Hilary... from Fresh Prince of Bel-Air." [...] The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air was a series that previously aired on NBC, and the Hilary character was a dull-witted individual who lacked intelligence. Before going their separate ways, Liz discovers that Wesley's last name is Snipes, but Wesley tells her that it is a name more fitting for a [...] "pale English guy", than actor Wesley Snipes. Liz and Wesley also attend a second run of the movie Hot Tub Time Machine, which provokes arguments between them despite their mutual enjoyment of the film.|$|E
2500|$|Pietersen {{was born}} to an English mother, Penny, and an Afrikaner father, Jannie. Pietersen had a strict and well-disciplined childhood, along with his three {{brothers}} Tony, Greg and Bryan; he learned valuable lessons from this [...] "fantastic" [...] approach to parenting, and said: [...] "Discipline is good. It taught me that I didn't always have to <b>have</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted; that what I needed was different from what I wanted." [...] Bryan plays club and second XI cricket in England.|$|E
6000|$|... "If my honour {{was not in}} your hands," [...] I said, [...] "I {{would leave}} you this instant, and never see you again. You <b>have</b> spoken of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> done. <b>What</b> <b>have</b> <b>I</b> done?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Until {{you spoke}} to her the other day, and until I saw in you a looking-glass that showed me <b>what</b> <b>I</b> once felt myself, I did not know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done. <b>What</b> <b>have</b> <b>I</b> done! <b>What</b> <b>have</b> <b>I</b> done!"

2500|$|Gabriel Flores (February 8, 1930 [...] December 14, 1993) was a {{prominent}} Mexican painter and muralist born in Guadalajara, Jalisco. Between 1956 and 1993, his murals focused on historical and universal themes, {{as well as the}} ability of art functioning as social commentary. In the 1960s, {{at the height of his}} career, he created his magnum opus Los Niños Héroes, depicting the sacrifice of six child soldiers during the Mexican-American War. Gabriel Flores described himself, saying [...] "I do not want much; I <b>have</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> like, above all my freedom." ...|$|E
2500|$|Swift {{explained}} to Billboard. [...] "I {{think the reason}} I said that was because I made the record {{exactly the same way}} I made the last three. I knew I hadn't jumped out of my comfort zone, which at the time was writing alone and working with Nathan. [...] the song was a real turning point for Red the album. When I wrote that song my mind started wandering to all the places we could go. If I were to think outside the box enough, go in with different people, I could learn from and have what they do rub off on me as well as <b>have</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> do rub off on them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Frame's writing {{became the}} focus of {{academic}} criticism from the late 1970s, with approaches ranging from Marxist and social realist, to feminist and poststructuralist. In later years, book-length monographs on Frame were published. These included Patrick Evans’s bio-critical contribution for the [...] "Twayne's World Authors Series," [...] Janet Frame (1977), Gina Mercer's feminist reading of the novels and autobiographies, Janet Frame: Subversive Fictions (1994), and Judith Dell Panny's allegorical approach to the works, I <b>have</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> gave: The fiction of Janet Frame (1992). A collection of essays edited by Jeanne Delbaere was first published in 1978, with a revised edition released under the title The Ring of Fire: Essays on Janet Frame in 1992. That same year, Dunedin's University of Otago hosted a conference dedicated to a discussion of Frame's work. Many of the papers were published in a special issue of The Journal of New Zealand Literature.|$|E

6000|$|... "You don't understand. <b>What</b> <b>have</b> <b>I?</b> <b>What</b> <b>have</b> <b>I</b> to save me? You can fight. Fighting is man's work. But women--women are different....

60|$|FAITH. I'll <b>have</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> like now, {{not what}} you think's good for me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps I ask too much," [...] he went on. [...] "Perhaps it isn't really {{possible}} to <b>have</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want. Men {{and women are}} too different. You can't understand--you don't understand--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Milray," [...] she said, {{pinching}} {{the edge}} of the table by which she sat, a little nervously, and banging her head a little, [...] "I think I can <b>have</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want." ...|$|E

60|$|I silently reconsidered {{the strange}} {{narrative}} which {{had just been}} related to me.

6000|$|If he {{had picked}} out the most {{inappropriate}} word in the whole dictionary to describe the lady whom I had met on the beach, [...] "Eccentricity" [...] would have been that word.

60|$|THE SERPENT. Listen. I {{will tell}} you a great secret. I am very subtle; and I have thought and thought and thought.
