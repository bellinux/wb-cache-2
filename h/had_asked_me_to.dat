500|$|Even {{to the end}} of his life, Speer {{continued}} to question his actions under Hitler. In his final book, Infiltration, he asks, [...] "What would have happened if Hitler <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> make decisions that required the utmost hardness?... How far would I have gone?... If I had occupied a different position, to what extent would I have ordered atrocities if Hitler had told me to do so?" [...] Speer leaves the questions unanswered.|$|E
500|$|Coincidentally Larry Hama, then {{an editor}} at Marvel, had begun to design {{characters}} and background for a series concept he was pitching that would be entitled Fury Force, about a team of futuristic super-soldiers affiliated with S.H.I.E.L.D., an existing Marvel Universe property combining military and science fiction genre elements. As Hama tells it, he got the job of writing for the series because Marvel had asked every other available creator to write it {{and no one else}} would. Unable to find other writing work, he later said that, [...] "If they <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> write Barbie, I would have done that, too." ...|$|E
2500|$|Keaton {{met with}} more {{success in the}} medium of still photography. Like her {{character}} in Annie Hall, Keaton had long relished photography as a favorite hobby, an interest she picked up as a teenager from her mother. While traveling in the late 1970s, she began exploring her avocation more seriously. [...] "Rolling Stone <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> take photographs for them, and I thought, 'Wait a minute, what I'm really interested in is these lobbies, and these strange ballrooms in these old hotels.' So I began shooting them", she recalled in 2003. [...] "These places were deserted, and I could just sneak in anytime and nobody cared. It was so easy and I could do it myself. It was an adventure for me." [...] Reservations, her collection of photos of hotel interiors, was published in book form in 1980.|$|E
2500|$|Her Majesty the Queen [...] <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> form a {{government}} and I have accepted.|$|R
60|$|The Khedive's mother <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> talk to {{you about}} a man called Abdul Said.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{should have}} thought it a greater compliment, and liked it better, if you <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> lunch with you alone," [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|I had {{got past}} being {{surprised}} at anything which might happen. If he <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{take his place}} upon the imperial throne I could only have nodded my busby.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{keep track}} of your growl, I {{might be able to}} tell you," [...] remarked the Lion sleepily. [...] "But frankly, Toto, I {{supposed}} you were taking care of it yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can, on {{the most}} indisputable, the most startling evidence--on the {{authority}} of Danville's own act. You <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> speak out--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I go into {{opposition}} again," [...] Borrowdean answered, [...] "it {{will be my}} own choice. Mannering <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{join his}} Cabinet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady Cantrip <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be at Custins in {{the middle}} of October. They say it is about the best pheasant-shooting in England." ...|$|R
60|$|But we didn't {{see very}} much of one another on that occasion. There was {{something}} in the air between us that made a faint embarrassment; the mere fact, perhaps, that she <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come up.|$|E
6000|$|... "A fine pass we are come to!" [...] cried Dr. May, half amused, half irate. [...] "I {{should like}} to know what I should have said at your age if the head-master <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> dinner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would have}} been very hard on me," [...] she said, [...] "if Olive <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> carry to you the news of your rejection. That is what I did for the others, I suppose you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{brother and}} the {{management}} of the club <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> pitch for Salisbury the remainder of the season. I shall be happy to--if----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wonder {{then that}} you should <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come forward again after what I did about the Irish land question," [...] said Phineas.|$|R
6000|$|... "I rather thought," [...] he said, [...] "of {{going into}} Norwich, {{if you could}} spare <b>me.</b> Captain Holt <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> lunch at the Barracks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How severe of you! Well, entre nous, I didn't {{break my}} heart about him; yet if he <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{do what you}} mean by your looks (and very {{expressive}} and kind they are, too), I wouldn't have said no." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Carroll <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{photograph}} {{his place}} for him when the apple orchards were in bloom. He has a picturesque old-fashioned country house behind a lawn of the most delightful old trees and flanked on each side by the orchards. So I went one June afternoon, with all my accoutrements, prepared to [...] "take" [...] the Carroll establishment in my best style.|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] replied Margaret, [...] "is a very {{different}} thing. If you <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> marry you, and, after thinking it over for a long while, I had answered Yes, which of course I should not have done, then, perhaps, before we were married you might have--Well, Peter, you have begun at the wrong end, which is very shameless and wicked of you, and I shall never speak to you again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{the devil}} am I to do? The {{governor}} <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{go down to}} Tretton, and I can't go without a five-pound note in my pocket." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Lady Tresham is all right," [...] he answered. [...] "I suppose I {{shall see}} you to-night {{if you are}} staying there. They <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> dinner!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very well, ma'am,' said Mrs Griffith, getting up. 'You're {{at liberty}} to think what you please, but I shall not come to church again. Mr Friend, the Baptist minister, <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go to his chapel, and I'm sure he won't treat me like that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only I did {{not want}} to go; my will was all the other way about. I had so newly thrown off the incubus of responsibility: I was still so fresh a renegade from duty that the {{daylight}} clearness of what I OUGHT to do had no power at all to touch my will. My will was to live, to gather pleasures and make my dear lady happy. But though this sense of vast neglected duties had no power to draw me, it could make me silent and preoccupied, it robbed the days I had spent of half their brightness and roused me into dark meditations in the silence of the night. And as I stood and watched Evesham's aeroplanes sweep to and fro--those birds of infinite ill omen--she stood beside me watching me, perceiving the trouble indeed, but not perceiving it clearly her eyes questioning my face, her expression shaded with perplexity. Her face was grey because the sunset was fading out of the sky. It was no fault of hers that she held me. She <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go from her, and again in the night time and with tears she <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go.|$|E
60|$|In {{the first}} place (as I have already said), I disliked him. In the second place, {{he was too old}} to be a fit {{companion}} for my other two pupils--both lads in their teens. In the third place, he <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> receive him at least three weeks before the vacation came to an end. I had my own pursuits and amusements in prospect during that interval, and saw no reason why I should inconvenience myself by setting them aside.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{possible}} that I might," [...] she said, [...] "but I won't. Haven't I told you that I don't approve of this affair of yours? My cousin {{is in love with}} Miss March, and all I should do for you would be directly against him. Aunt so managed things this morning that I was actually obliged to give you an opportunity to be with her, but I had intended going with Roberta to the woods, as she <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "MR. JULIAN GRAY <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> tell him, {{and to tell}} you, Mr. Holmcroft, how my {{troubles}} began. They began {{before my}} recollection. They began with my birth.|$|R
6000|$|... "O, Mrs. Day, Fancy <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{bring out}} the hartshorn, please, because she has stung her lip!" [...] said Dick, {{a little closer to}} Mrs. Day's face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--Mr. Greystock. He <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me.</b> He <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be his wife. I {{thought he}} loved me. I hoped he did, at least. Oh dear, I did so hope it! And he does!" ...|$|R
6000|$|This evening I {{read to you}} {{the poem}} which you <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> [...] read. You sat before me with your brown head leaning on your [...] hands and your eyes cast down. I stole dear glances at you [...] between the lines. When I {{finished}} I put a red, red rose from [...] your garden between the pages and crushed the book close on [...] it. That poem will always be dear to me, stained with the [...] life-blood of a rose-like hour.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do I owe no {{forbearance}} to a {{woman who}} asks a favour of me?" [...] Amelius went on. [...] "If a man <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> steal into the house on tiptoe, I should have said--well! I should have said something I had better not repeat. If a man had stood between me and the door when you came back, I should have taken him by the collar and pulled him out of my way. Could I do that, if you please, with Mrs. Farnaby?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{found the}} Vicomte much {{exercised}} {{in mind as}} {{to the meaning of}} Marsac's extraordinary behaviour, and I was relieved to see that he, at least, could conjecture no cause for it. In reply to the questions with which he very naturally assailed me, I assured him that it {{was no more than a}} matter of a misunderstanding; that Monsieur de Marsac <b>had</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> meet him at Grenade in two days' time, and that I should then, no doubt, be able to make all clear.|$|E
6000|$|... "I await my family's congratulations," [...] she said, {{with her}} head in the air. [...] "Mr. Raffles Haw has been here, and he <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be his wife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is true. Mr. Thorndyke {{has offered}} me an apology, which I am forced to believe sincere. He <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be his wife! I {{was sorry for}} him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Monsieur Fletcher," [...] he said, when {{he reached}} Philip, [...] "the prince <b>has</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{say that it is}} his wish that you shall ride forward, and {{accompany}} him." ...|$|R
