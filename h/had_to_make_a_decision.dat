At this point, the band <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> whether to stay on at university, or quit their courses and move to London to turn professional. Pearne was not keen to abandon his studies, so decided to leave the group.|$|E

500|$|... 2006: In an {{interview}} with ESPN in January, after the Packers had finished with a 4-12 record, Favre admitted that if he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> right away he would not come back. He {{went on to say}} [...] "There's other days, I go, 'What if it's crunch time, two minutes left, do you want the ball?' I don't know if I do." [...] In March, Favre hears Phil Simms say on Sirius Radio that as long as Favre can physically play the game, he should. Shortly thereafter, Favre confirms he would return to play. After the Packers defeated the Chicago Bears the last game of the season 26-7, Favre choked up during {{an interview}} with Andrea Kremer by saying [...] "If today's my last game, I want to remember it. It's tough. It's tough. I'll miss these guys. I'll miss this game. I just want every one to know that...I didn't plan on doing this. Way to put me on the spot." [...] Asked if he was indeed going to retire, Favre responded [...] "We'll see. We'll see. I don't want to say anything right now." [...] After the game, a Packers teammate said that Favre was just as emotional in a speech after the Seattle Seahawks game in 2005 at Lambeau Field when he was all but certain he was going to retire.|$|E

500|$|The {{first season}} aired {{earlier in the}} United States than elsewhere, thus in early 1993, Rysher TPE, the {{distributor}} that had sold the series to the American market, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> about financing a new season. At this point, the European partners still had not aired the first season, so the decision fell to Rysher. Willing to take the risk, Rysher {{announced that it would}} produce a second season. The France/Canada co-production agreement of the previous season was reconstituted, albeit with some different partners. Gaumont Television (France), Rysher TPE (United States) and Reteitalia (Italy) agreed to renew their participation to a new season. French leading channel TF1 was forced to cancel its participation because it was no longer legally allowed to qualify a show filmed in English as French content, and was replaced by French smaller channel M6, which was still allowed to do so. RTL Plus (Germany) and Amuse Video (Japan) were also no longer part of the co-production, but Gaumont Television president Christian Charret signed Filmline International (Canada) as a new partner. As a result of this new co-production agreement, with less wealthy partners, the budget of the season decreased from US$26.1 million the previous year to $22 million. Half of the funding came from French and other European sources; income per episode from international sales, which had reached $800,000 in the previous season, decreased as well. According to The Hollywood Reporter, pre-production started in April 1993, and filming in June the same year. Like the first season, the second season was divided into two segments; the first segment was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada (as the fictional city of Seacouver, Washington, United States), and the second in Paris, France, to secure an acceptable share of European content as part of the co-production agreement. Creatively, the second season was intended to be more action-oriented than the first, but lead actor Adrian Paul refused to do [...] "another kung fu series," [...] insisting that more romance and history be brought in the scripts.|$|E

[...] It was found that this was in accordance with the law, but that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> for which electorate he would sit. On 15 July 1876, Grey announced that he would represent Thames, and he moved that a by-election be held in Auckland West for the seat that he would vacate there.|$|E
2500|$|The {{game was}} demoed at the 1998 Macworld Expo. In June 1998, The Washington Times {{reported}} {{the game was}} set to be released on Macintosh and PC in September of that year. It would eventually be released on October 21, 1998. The game was made available directly to schools, along with other edutainment titles by Lucas Learning. In March 1999, the game was [...] "currently available wherever software is sold". In June 1999, the game was noted as being sold at two-store specialty groups. The game was marketed and packaged as an entertainment title, and was advertised in gaming magazines and Family PC. While the developers thought the game blurred the line between entertainment and education, this originally presented an issue for the marketers as they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> whether to place the game on the clearly divided [...] "game" [...] and [...] "education" [...] shelves; it helped that Lucas Learning were able to leverage LucasArts' success and the Star Wars name to get into retail stores such as Walmart and Costco.|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} of Ethel initially {{remained on the}} show for 12 years, although her appearances towards the end became more widely spaced and she only returned to the show intermittently. Off-screen Gretchen Franklin retired, however 3 years after her last brief appearance Ethel was reintroduced to the show for one final and highly controversial storyline. The storyline involved her old friend Dot helping her to commit suicide. When Ethel Skinner became ill in September 2000, she asked Dot to help her when the time finally came for her to pass away. Dot <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> that went against her moral and religious beliefs. In the end Dot decided that friendship was more important and so she helped Ethel die peacefully. Written by Simon Ashdown and directed by Francesca Joseph the episode ended with a touching scene in which Ethel tells a weeping Dot [...] "you're the best friend I ever had". The finishing touch {{was the use of}} an alternative end title music, replacing the dramatic drum beats with a war time orchestral piece. The ramifications of this storyline were immense for the {{character of}} Dot, and the consequences of her actions were examined in detail - which included a crisis of faith. Such was the controversy surrounding this storyline that the University of Glamorgan uses the plot as part of their new approach to the study of British criminal law. Part of the law foundation course involves studying the soap opera and giving students the chance to decide if Dot Cotton's character is guilty of murder.|$|E
