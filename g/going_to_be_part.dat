Along with this, the sex appeal that {{was originally}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> of Lightning's look was transferred to Fang to give Lightning a more hard-edged persona. Fang is voiced by Rachel Robinson in English, and Mabuki Andou in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Although {{initially}} {{skeptical about}} the role, Perrineau took it after Lost creator J. J. Abrams told him more about it. Much of the first season arc for Michael was rewritten; he was originally <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> of a love triangle with Korean couple Sun (Yunjin Kim) and Jin (Daniel Dae Kim), but positive fan reaction to the couple meant this storyline was dropped. After Michael leaves the Island in season two, Perrineau knew {{he would return to}} Lost at some point; he felt there was more to tell of Michael's story. Reception for the character was mixed. However, Perrineau's acting was praised.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 2009, it was speculated that van der Vaart would leave Real Madrid after being told he was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> of the team's plans by coach Manuel Pellegrini. His number 23 jersey was even handed to Esteban Granero in preseason, leaving him without a squad number. Towards {{the end of the}} summer {{transfer}} window, however, he eventually came to an agreement with Real Madrid to stay with the club after the squad size had been reduced to 25 players as Dutch compatriots Wesley Sneijder, Arjen Robben and Klaas-Jan Huntelaar were forced to leave the club. Van der Vaart was handed his original number 23 jersey while Granero was given number 24. After a wait of four games, Van der Vaart was finally included in Pellegrini's squad list to face Villarreal on 23 September. An injury to Kaká gave Van der Vaart a chance to establish himself as a key player for Los Blancos again. On 20 December, he scored two goals in a 6–0 win against Real Zaragoza. He scored his last goal for Real Madrid against Málaga on 16 May 2010. Van der Vaart stated his desire to stay at Real Madrid, at least until the end of his contract.|$|E

500|$|Outside Japan, Destiny 2 was {{released}} in China and South Korea by Sony Computer Entertainment in 2003: the Korean version {{was released}} on March 27, and the Chinese version was released on August 14. The game was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> of a world tour by Sony Computer Entertainment to promote {{the next generation of}} role-playing games, but the tensions between America and Iraq at the time and the consequent risks of a terrorist attack caused them to cancel the trip. Asked at the launch event whether an overseas version of the game was being developed, producer Makoto Yoshizumi said he was [...] "not certain". The PSP port {{was released in}} South Korea by Namco Bandai Games's local branch on March 5, 2007. Neither the original nor the port has been released in the west, making it one of three mainline Tales titles to remain exclusive to Japan.|$|E
500|$|When the {{producers}} were auditioning actors for roles in Lost, Harold Perrineau {{was in the}} area. The producers called it a [...] "natural move" [...] to have him audition. Although initially skeptical about the show, he took the role when Lost creator J. J. Abrams explained more about it. Perrineau was attracted to the role because [...] "'s a guy that's {{in a lot of}} conflict and we're not exactly sure why". In season one, Michael was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> of a love triangle with Sun and Jin, however this was dropped after positive fan reaction to Sun and Jin's relationship. The storyline is revisited in the [...] mobisode [...] "Buried Secrets", which shows Michael and Sun almost kissing. Michael and Jin were going to be enemies throughout all of the season, but {{the producers}} felt Perrineau and Daniel Dae Kim had good chemistry, so the storyline was changed to them becoming friends. Perrineau called filming the first season [...] "one of [...] best years as a working actor".|$|E
500|$|Fi {{was created}} before the {{implantation}} of Wii MotionPlus, {{when she was}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> of some different undefined gameplay concepts unrelated to motion control. Her design {{was based on the}} design of the Master Sword, referencing her origins as the sword's spirit. [...] She also served as an alternative explanatory voice as Link was a silent protagonist. According to staff, Fi's technical dialogue for each area of the game was written by different people, verbal inconsistencies arose that needed addressing, so Fujibayashi adjusted them all so she sounded consistent. Nearly all of Fi's dialogue was ultimately written by Fujibayashi. Ghirahim was designed to be similar to the Dark Link character from Ocarina of Time: he could read Link's movements, requiring players to think strategically to defeat him rather than simply swinging Link's sword around randomly. Character designs were far more detailed than in previous Zelda titles. Clothing was frequently designed to complement backgrounds, such as Zelda's pink and red dress in the opening. The game's use of warm colors and brushstroke-like aesthetics was inspired by impressionist artwork, pioneered in the 19th century by painters such as Claude Monet: a particular element cited by Miyamoto was the sky, which he called a tribute to the work of Paul Cézanne. The basic starting point for the art style was the fact of it being a fantasy world. The final version was referred to as a balance between the more overt cartoon styling of [...] and Twilight Princess, where the cartoon shading was transferred onto an older version of Link. The team settled this artstyle as it would properly portray the more exaggerated actions of some characters and general swordplay while preserving Link's mature appearance.|$|E

500|$|Producers of Mad Men {{approached}} January Jones {{to portray}} Betty Draper, Don's {{wife and the}} mother of their two children. Jones avouched that portraying the character would give the audience an opportunity to see a dark side of her nature. She initially auditioned for the role of Peggy Olson, which was later given to fellow cast member Elisabeth Moss. [...] "It got down between Elisabeth Moss and myself, and it was obviously more suited to her, but Matthew had said, you know, there’s this other role, of the wife." [...] Jones signed a seven-year contract with the show, although her character originally had two lines in [...] "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes." [...] Weiner eventually edited the script to accommodate her desires. [...] "It’s such a testament to his ability," [...] Jones stated. [...] "He just took something out of thin air, which makes me think now that he had to have had an idea that the wife was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> of the show, because I kind of took the job with the promise that Betty would {{be a part of the}} show. When you sign a seven-year contract, you want to make sure you’re in the show." [...] Christina Hendricks was brought in to play Joan Holloway, the office manager and head of Sterling Cooper's secretarial pool. While Hendricks had previously made recurring appearances on ER before being on Mad Men, her acting career had been largely inactive, and Hendricks' agent urged her not to participate in the project. [...] "They said to me, 'AMC [...] doesn't have any other big shows—why would you do this instead of taking something that's a better bet?' I said, 'Look, I've gone with the one that's the better bet in the past—let's go with the really good script this time.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Sarah Chatfield, who {{wanted to do a}} Tom and Jerry-like video, where the human character is cut off at the waist. Hence Allen was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> of it originally. However, she did appear on the video. The singer declared on her official blog that, I did a video shoot for the next single, which is Alfie, and that was quite a lot of fun, Alfie was played by a puppet and the whole thing looks like an episode of a mixture Tom and Jerry and Roger Rabbit, you'll understand when you see it. The whole day was a pleasurable experience [...] The video starts off with an opening title parodying Looney Tunes and shows Allen in the kitchen preparing a cup of tea, while Alfie, impersonated by a puppet, smokes in his miniature bedroom, watching television. The singer enters the room and takes away his bong, as he unsuccessfully tries to get it back. Next, Allen irons his tuxedo and marks a job announcement called [...] "The Puppet Show" [...] in the newspaper, as the lyric [...] "You need to get a job because the bills need to get paid" [...] is sung. Meanwhile, Alfie is in his bed, staring at a magazine in which there are undressed dolls, titled [...] "Roxy & Babs get it on!" [...] and proceeds to masturbate. Allen walks in on him with the newspaper and suit as he does so, but immediately exits out of embarrassment. With the start of the bridge, puppet birds sing outside the home, while Alfie sneaks out of his room and tries to get beer out of the refrigerator, but is ultimately caught by Allen. She then takes off his [...] "stupid fitted cap", as he scrawls a picture of her, which is also the cover of [...] "Littlest Things". The final scene happens at night, in the kitchen, where Allen is lying on the floor, watching her brother dance. After the last lyrics, [...] "Please don't despair, my dear, mon frere" [...] is sung, he punches her and the video ends.|$|E

[...] He expanded on these difficulties stating, [...] "The thing that we didn’t really plan on — because we weren’t aware that we were going to switch Supergirl from CBS to CW and it was really <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>part</b> of it — that was the one show that didn't have built-in shut-down days, so all the other ones did...
