5|$|Bastei Verlag, enamoured by {{the success}} of Bessy, asked Vandersteen to provide a second weekly series. With the {{popularity}} of superheroes, especially Batman, in Belgium and Germpany in these years, Vandersteen proposed a spinoff series of Suske en Wiske, based on Jerom, the strongman of the series. Called Wastl in German, 173 stories were produced between 1968 and 1972, with a publication that reached 150,000 copies at its summit. The best of these stories were published in Dutch as well, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was done with the later Bessys, but the weakness of the stories ended the series after only four years.|$|E

Clark's relationship with Lex Luthor was symbolic, as the two shared a yin and yang type of relationship. In the pilot, Clark first saved Lex from drowning after a car accident; at the end of the episode, Lex saved Clark when he was strung up in the cornfield and immobilized by kryptonite. His relationship with Lex was tested by his lack of honesty, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was with Lana for the first six seasons; the same could be said for Lex's dishonesty with Clark. Both characters wanted to be completely honest with each other, but knew they could not, which inhibited their friendship.|$|E
5|$|The only track {{left after}} the {{demolishing}} {{was a short}} section at Lier Station, which remained until the station closed in 1973. The old Lier Station has been preserved. The section between Reenskaug, located a few hundred meters (yards) from Lier Station, to Landfald has become the suburban street Lijevegen. From Landfall to Egge, the right-of-way is an overgrown path. From Egge to Muggerud, the right-of-way is used as the street Banevegen. In 1993, the right-of-way from Muggerud to Rønningen was rebuilt as a hiking and riding path. The branch towards Tronstad Bruk has been converted to a street, {{although most of the}} right-of-way north of Rønning has disappeared, as it has been reclaimed as agricultural land, particularly north of Sylling. The station area at Svangstand in intact, with the station building looking <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> did in 1904. Other station buildings have been converted to homes or commercial buildings.|$|E

Customer input played a large part into the design of the third generation Taurus' interior.|$|E

500|$|Contemporary {{constitutional}} scholar George Williams criticises the court's literal {{interpretation of}} the provision {{and others in the}} Constitution, saying the court has [...] "transformed the Constitution into a wasteland of civil liberties". Williams argues that as an [...] "express guarantee of personal freedom", the provision should be interpreted broadly and promote [...] "individual liberty over the arbitrary exercise of legislative and executive power". [...] Academics Gonzalo Villalta Puig and Steven Tudor have called for the court to broaden Section116 by finding in it an implied right to the freedom of thought and conscience. In their view most Australians correctly [...] "believe that the Constitution protects the right to freedom of thought and conscience <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> protects other civil and political freedoms", and that the court should give effect to that belief. They argue there is precedent for the court finding implied constitutional rights, such as the 1992 case of Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth, where the court found that the Constitution guaranteed the freedom of political communication.|$|E
500|$|Whether the {{collection}} has a unified structure {{has been a}} source of debate among Hemingway critics. According to Reynolds {{the collection}} should be [...] "read as a predictable step in any young author's career" [...] and the pieces considered as [...] "discrete units". Yet he admits that Hemingway's remarks, and the complexity of the structure, suggests the stories and vignettes were meant to be an interconnected whole. In a letter to Pound in August 1923, Hemingway told him he had finished the full set of eighteen vignettes, saying of them, [...] "When they are read together, they all hook up... The bulls start, then reappear, then finish off. The war starts clear and noble <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> did... gets close and blurred and finished with the feller who goes home and gets clap." [...] He went on to say of [...] "in our time" [...] that [...] "it has form all right". On October 18, 1924, he wrote to Edmund Wilson, [...] "Finished the book of 14 stories with a chapter of 'In Our Time' between each story– that is the way they are meant to go– to give the picture of the whole before examining it in detail".|$|E
500|$|Dissenting, Justice Scalia {{would have}} held that {{although}} Abramski made a false statement by claiming {{that he was the}} buyer/transferee, since Alvarez was lawfully able to buy the gun, the statement is not [...] "with respect to any fact material to the lawfulness of the sale," [...] which is the requirement in §922(a)(6). Additionally, the dissent criticized the government's use of the [...] "agency law" [...] principle to determine that Abramski was a third party’s common-law agent for Alvarez. Instead, the dissent believed that common English should be used to interpret statutes, and therefore, under the statue, Abramski was the [...] "person" [...] buying the gun, not Alvarez. Furthermore, the dissent did not think that the statute is [...] "rendered meaningless" [...] simply because one can buy a gun on behalf of another, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> is not rendered meaningless when one gifts a gun. The dissent also wondered why the majority wouldn't agree that this is yet another loophole to a statute that has so many loopholes, and argued that perhaps it was congress' intent to only limit the actual person at the counter. The dissent also stated that even if the majority had the proper interpretation of the statute, the ambiguity should be resolved in favor of lenity. Regarding the Section 924 charges, the dissent explained that the statute clearly lists what the dealer is required to maintain on record, and that {{the answer to the question}} of whether he is the actual buyer is not on the list. The dissent stated that the majority's interpretation ultimately carried the text too far. [...] "f the bureaucrats responsible for creating Form 4473 decided to ask about the buyer’s favorite color, a false response would be a federal crime."

Similarly, Nathan S. of the website DJ Booth wrote that the song was suitable for [...] "ecstatic" [...] fans to sing along without efforts during a stadium concert: [...] "This {{is the kind of}} chorus that's going to be sung at full force in traffic jams for months to come, and while XO may be relatively more subdued, that call and response is destined to be a monster when performed live, right down to the way her voice shows a little wear, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> would {{at the end of a}} show." [...] Jody Rosen writing for Vulture found a [...] "cavernous widescreen" [...] anthemic pop sound in the song further saying that its chorus sounded like it was specifically made for an Olympics opening ceremony. Carrie Battan of Pitchfork described the song as a [...] "stadium-filling" [...] one and classified it as one of Beyoncés [...] "decorous moments". Joe Lynch from Fuse described [...] "XO" [...] as the [...] "most uplifting" [...] pop song since Florence and the Machine's [...] "Shake It Out" [...] (2011). He praised the electronic flourishes, saying that they managed to [...] "keep the music from veering into banal territory" [...] and concluded that the song has a [...] "quirky" [...] sound previously unheard on other material by Beyoncé.
