5|$|In November 2010, Walker joined League Two side Stevenage on loan until January 2011. He {{made his}} club debut {{just a day}} after signing for the club, {{starting}} in Stevenage's televised FA Cup tie away at AFC Wimbledon. It {{was to be a}} scoring debut for Walker, scoring a free-kick that went <b>in</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> post to give Stevenage the lead in a 2–0 victory. He made his first league appearance for Stevenage in the club's 1–0 home loss to Northampton Town in December 2010, a game in which Walker hit the crossbar from a free-kick. Despite being due to stay at Stevenage until the beginning of January 2011, Walker was recalled by his parent club Watford on 23 December, in order to provide cover for the injured Stephen McGinn. Walker made two appearances for Stevenage, scoring one goal, as his loan spell at the club was disrupted by fixture postponements.|$|E
5|$|The hosts Arsenal played Paris Saint-Germain in {{the later}} game. Although the {{visitors}} dominated play in the first 45 minutes, they went behind at the cusp of half-time, when Arsenal midfielder Mathieu Flamini scored. He collected the ball from Nicklas Bendtner and his first-time shot went <b>in</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> post. Wenger tweaked his team's formation after the break from their customary 4–4–2 to 4–4–1–1 and made five changes to his team. He positioned right-back Emmanuel Eboué as a midfielder, and Alexander Hleb behind Bendtner. Arsenal's performance improved {{in the second half}} and they doubled their lead through Bendtner in the 70th minute. Goalkeeper Manuel Almunia immediately denied Pauleta with a stretching save at the far post, but could not prevent Péguy Luyindula from scoring. Arsenal held on to win by two goals.|$|E
5|$|Weather systems {{affecting}} Newfoundland usually {{originate from}} the west, over mainland Canada, {{or from the}} southwest, from {{the east coast of}} the United States. Cyclonic storms consist of an area of low atmospheric pressure characterized by inward spiraling winds that rotate counter clockwise in the northern hemisphere. Such storms passing to the south of the island bring strong northeasterly winds sweeping <b>in</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> open North Atlantic Ocean. These storms are sometimes referred to as Nor'easters and are responsible for the worst of Newfoundland's weather. High winds sweeping over a large surface of ocean can build up very large waves. The frequency and severity of storms is greatest between November and March, although they may occur at any time of the year.|$|E

5|$|York drew 1–1 {{away with}} Carlisle, {{who took the}} lead early {{in the first half}} through Jason Kennedy, before Summerfield {{equalised}} for York on 87 minutes after Fewster's shot hit the post. Nolan left by mutual consent, before Hendrie had his loan extended {{to the end of the}} season. Platt returned to Harrogate on a one-month loan, while Ľubomír Šatka, a Slovakia under-21 international, joined one a one-month youth loan from Newcastle. Former Scotland international striker Derek Riordan, who last played for East Fife, was signed on a contract until the end of the season, after impressing during a two-week trial. York moved within three points of safety after beating Stevenage 2–1 at home, McEvoy scoring the opening goal in the 15th minute with a shot from 12yards. Keith Keane scored an equaliser for Stevenage on 78 minutes, before Galbraith scored the winning goal in the third minute of stoppage time, with a low shot <b>in</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> post from the edge of the penalty area.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the 2010–11 season, Bostwick {{scored in}} a {{pre-season}} friendly against Hitchin Town, {{and made his}} first league appearance in the club's 2–2 draw with Macclesfield Town, playing the whole match. He scored his first goal {{of the season in}} the club's first ever Football League victory, in a 3–1 win against Stockport County, scoring with a shot from 30yards to double Stevenage's lead just before the interval. In November 2010, Bostwick provided two assists for Stevenage's goals in the club's 3–0 win away at local rivals Barnet. Bostwick scored his second goal of the 2010–11 season in Stevenage's 3–1 FA Cup win over Newcastle United in January 2011. Bostwick picked up a loose pass and rifled a shot that went <b>in</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> post from 25yards out to give Stevenage a two-goal lead. A month later, he scored his third goal of the season in a 4–0 win against Cheltenham Town, cutting in from the right and drilling a low shot across the face of goal and past the goalkeeper. Bostwick played a total of 51 matches during the 2010–11 season, scoring three goals. This included three appearances in the 2010–11 League Two play-offs following Stevenage's sixth-placed finish. Following a 3–0 aggregate victory over Accrington Stanley, Stevenage earned promotion to League One after a 1–0 win against Torquay United at Old Trafford on 28 May 2011, with Bostwick playing the whole match.|$|E
5|$|Albion's sole goalscoring {{opportunity}} {{of the second}} half came afterwards; Clark took the ball on a lengthy run before crossing it into the box, across an open goal with no Albion player there to tap the ball in and put the game beyond QPR's reach. Fifteen minutes {{from the end of the}} match QPR equalised, Marsh's shot with his right foot went <b>in</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> post. A corner followed for QPR who were now dominating Albion with their style of play. Allen crossed it in to Lazarus, but the Albion goalkeeper saved the shot with his legs. With eight minutes to go, one of Albion defenders mis-kicked the ball in their own penalty area. Hunt rushed in for the chance but Sheppard once again saved the game for Albion. The ball ran free to Mike Lazarus who tapped the ball into the back of an empty net to increase the scoreline to 3–2 in QPR's favour. A final attack from QPR came in the closing moments of the game as Lazarus took the ball past two defenders and into the box, his subsequent shot hit the outside of the post and went wide.|$|E

25|$|Located {{along the}} Loire River {{near the town}} of Angers, the region of Anjou has a mild {{continental}} climate with some maritime influences due to its close proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. This influence is tempered by the forests of the Vendée department to the southwest which absorbs the brunt of the rainfall and winds coming <b>in</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic. Annual rainfall totals for the region usually hover around 19inches (500mm). The vineyard soils close to the Loire River are composed primarily of carboniferous rock and schist. Chenin blanc, in particular, seems to do well in this soil type.|$|E

25|$|The first {{knockout}} round draw {{took place}} on 21 December, and paired Manchester United with Lyon of France. The last (and only) time United were paired with Lyon was in the group stage of the 2004–05 UEFA Champions League, in which the away tie finished as a 2–2 draw, while United won the home leg 2–1. The away leg was played on 20 February, and saw Lyon go 1–0 up in the 54th minute, through a Karim Benzema shot that went <b>in</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> post.

It {{was more of a}} shock then that Middlesbrough were the side to advance through to the fifth round courtesy of a 2–1 victory. Boro winger Adam Johnson spurned several chances before Afonso Alves chipped the goalkeeper on the stroke of half-time. Wolves headed home an equaliser in the second half, but substitute Marvin Emnes fired <b>in</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> post seven minutes from time.|$|E

25|$|The Anderson Valley {{is one of}} California's coolest {{wine growing}} regions in the state being deeply {{influenced}} by the cool Pacific fog coming <b>in</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> coast. Early plantings of Chardonnay, Gewurztraminer, and Pinot Noir in the 1960s and 1970s {{led to the formation}} of a handful of wineries by 1980. The potential for sparkling wine production became apparent in the 1980s when Champagne house Louis Roederer selected Anderson Valley for its California operation Roederer Estate. The Champagne firm scouted California extensively for years trying to find a region with the most climatic similarities to the Champagne region of France. Pinot Noir - grown for both sparkeling and still wine production - is the dominant varietal for the region. A 2015 vineyard census determined that 87 of 91 vineyard properties in the region grow Pinot Noir.|$|E
25|$|On 12 December, Aliadière {{received}} {{the ball from}} a poor clearance by Sochaux goalkeeper Simon Pouplin and found Alain Traoré, who fizzed a long-range effort <b>in</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> left-hand post, giving Lorient a 1–0 lead; Lorient {{went on to win}} 2–0 and moved up to fourth in the Ligue 1 table. Lorient continued their ascent up the Ligue 1 table with a 2–0 defeat of Saint-Étienne on 16 December, Aliadière opening the scoring in the 20th minute after defeating two defenders and finishing past the goalkeeper. In the January transfer window, Aliadière was linked to a return move to England by joining Middlesbrough's rival Newcastle United, due to personal reasons, but the move was rejected by the club. Eventually, he remained at the club throughout the transfer window and said that transfer speculation did not affect his form, and even hints to play for the France national team.|$|E
25|$|Winmar {{donated the}} jumper {{he was wearing}} in the {{photograph}} to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) in 1998. Prior to the commission's disbanding in 2005, Geoff Clark, the chairman of ATSIC at the time, removed the framed jumper from the commission's offices in Canberra {{to his home in}} Warrnambool, Victoria. Clark was forced to return the jumper to Winmar, which was later donated to the National Museum of Australia, where it featured <b>in</b> <b>Off</b> <b>the</b> Walls, an exhibit of Indigenous Australian art. In May 2012, the jumper was auctioned by Sotheby's, but was passed in after the bidding reached A$95,000. In September of the same year, Museum Victoria purchased the jumper for $100,000, with the intention to display it at the First Peoples exhibition at Melbourne Museum in July 2013. However, the authenticity of the jumper has been questioned, with the St Kilda Football Club published a statement in March 2005 suggesting that the jumper given to ATSIC {{may not have been the}} actual jumper worn during the game, citing differences between sponsors' logos present on the jumper. Similar questions were raised prior to the jumper's auction in 2012.|$|E

25|$|The return {{game against}} was played {{a week later}} on 17 March 2016 at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium. Defender Adil Rami opened the scoring as he stooped to head a José Antonio Reyes corner <b>in</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> post. The match then slipped out of Basel's reach inside two minutes {{at the end of}} the first half. Reyes danced through the Basel defence and his low cross gave Kévin Gameiro an easy finish from close range. A minute later, Michael Krohn-Dehli {{advanced}} with a quick run and was the provider of the cross that found Gameiro. The striker's header came back off the underside of the crossbar and bounced in off his leg to make it 3–0 at half-time. Basel showed only small signs of a fightback. Luca Zuffi's effort from 25 yards out was still rising as it flew over the crossbar. Breel Embolo missed two chances late in the game as the Swiss side were dumped out of the competition. The result extended Sevilla's run of Europa League home wins to 11 – the longest in the competition's history and put a dent in Basel's impressive away record in Europe this season.|$|E
25|$|On October 4, 2007, Staal {{made his}} National Hockey League debut for the New York Rangers, {{as well as}} for Head Coach Tom Renney, who would use him in that first season {{primarily}} in a defensive role. Staal would record his first NHL point against the Washington Capitals on November 1, 2007, when Chris Drury deflected his shot in for a goal, earning Staal an assist. Staal scored his first NHL goal on November 14, 2007, against the New Jersey Devils at the Prudential Center. His wrist shot from the left faceoff circle sailed over the outstretched glove of goaltender Martin Brodeur and deflected <b>in</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> crossbar. Assisting on his first goal in the NHL were teammates Scott Gomez and Brendan Shanahan. During 2007–08, Staal was one of 16 rookies selected to participate in the YoungStars competition at the 2008 NHL All-Star Game in Atlanta, where he scored a goal and added an assist. Staal finished his rookie season with ten points on the strength of two goals and eight assists; he also established himself as a reliable defender, posting a positive plus/minus rating at +2, as the Rangers qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs. He saved his best for the playoffs, with his first NHL playoff goal and two assists to help the Rangers defeat the Devils in five games during the Eastern Conference Quarter-finals. The goal was important — in the pivotal Game 4, Staal's slapper broke a 3–3 deadlock late in the third period and stood to be the game-winning goal in a 5–3 victory that gave the Rangers a 3–1 lead in the series. Like his first regular season goal, it also came against Martin Brodeur. However, despite their win over the Devils in the Conference Quarter-finals, the Rangers would fall to the eventual Stanley Cup runner-up Pittsburgh Penguins in the Eastern Conference Semi-finals.|$|E
25|$|The Hertfordshire outfit made it 10 games unbeaten with a 40 {{victory over}} Hayes & Yeading. Striker Charlie Griffin scored {{twice in the}} first-half, and {{completed}} his hat-trick from the penalty spot in the 70th minute. Michael Bostwick added a fourth in injury-time. Another victory followed a week later, as Stevenage beat Salisbury City 31 at Broadhall Way. Mark Roberts scored his first goal of the season on his 50th appearance for the club just before the interval, before the visitors levelled through substitute Chris Flood after half-time. Charlie Griffin scored his fourth goal in two games to give the Hertfordshire outfit the lead, before Chris Beardsley added a third with his first touch after good work from Yemi Odubade. Three days later, the side drew 00 with Wrexham at Broadhall Way. Another draw followed 10 days later, as Stevenage drew 11 with Kettering Town at Rockingham Road. Joel Byrom gave Borough the lead courtesy of a second-minute free-kick. The home side equalised in the latter stages of the first-half through Moses Ashikodi to ensure {{a share of the}} spoils. After a two-week break from the league, Stevenage got back to winning ways with a 53 win over Gateshead at Broadhall Way. The visitors took the lead seven minutes before half-time, Charlie Griffin heading into his own net following Craig Baxter's dangerous free-kick. Two minutes later Griffin atoned for his error by finishing neatly over Paul Farman. Stevenage took the lead five minutes later; Mitchell Cole providing Yemi Odubade with a simple tap-in; his first goal at Broadhall Way. On the stroke of half-time Griffin headed in Scott Laird's inviting cross to ensure a two-goal lead going into the break. However, the away side pulled a goal back through Daryl Clare, before Griffin completed his hat-trick with a drilled free-kick that went <b>in</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> post. Clare pounced on a fumbled free-kick to make it 43, before Michael Bostwick scored his fifth goal of the season to make it 53. Stevenage then travelled to The New Lawn to face Forest Green Rovers a week later. Lee Boylan's fourth-minute goal ultimately proved to be the winner as Borough ran out 10 winners.|$|E
