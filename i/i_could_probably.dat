500|$|To {{prepare for}} filming, Doherty watched former Beverly Hills, 90210 co-star Tori Spelling's reality show about her {{relationship}} with husband Dean McDermott and Keeping Up with the Kardashians. In a New York Daily News interview, she resisted comparisons to Kim Kardashian's publicized wedding and divorce from basketball player Kris Humphries. Doherty described the series as a documentary, rather than a reality show, saying {{that she was an}} actor rather than a reality personality. She also called the project [...] "the best wedding video in the world". Before its premiere, Barry Walsh of Realscrean.com described it as a docuseries. The show received additional publicity when Spelling offered to plan Doherty's wedding during an interview with Entertainment Tonight Canada: [...] "I'll do the wedding, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>probably</b> comment on the wedding she'd want 20 years ago, but that wouldn't make any sense." ...|$|E
500|$|Actor James Anderson {{was cast}} as Oliver. Before {{assuming}} the role, he shadowed a real F1 doctor on ward rounds – an experience he found difficult. [...] "We were approaching beds {{in which people}} were waking up from heart attacks and coming around quite distressed sometimes. It was really difficult {{to be there with}} a patient. It's harder than you think and I got quite emotional." [...] Anderson underwent such extensive training with the programme's medical advisors that he jested in June2009, [...] "If I started medical training now, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>probably</b> graduate as a doctor coming out of the show!" [...] The actor experienced [...] "an extended period of anxiety" [...] upon joining the series, and recalls: [...] "It took me about six months to have any sense {{of what was going on}} and then the second six months to feel comfortable [...] but only because it's such a well-oiled machine. You're coming in as a little cog, so you have to discover how to work in that and that takes a while." ...|$|E

500|$|Saadiq toured {{for about}} two years to promote The Way I See It, {{performing}} in venues throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia. He was originally apprehensive at the prospect of touring extensively, having toured minimally as a solo act. He reconsidered at the advice of his rhythm guitarist Rob Bacon, which he recounted in an interview for the Los Angeles Times: [...] "The money was just OK, so I was like, 'I don't know – <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>probably</b> stay home and find something better,' But then Rob reminded me, 'You know, all those cats you love, that's exactly what they did. Little Richard? He played 10 shows a day at the Apollo.' I said, 'OK, let's go.'" [...] To complement his songs' style, Saadiq adopted a vintage soul image and, having studied footage of classic soul groups and album sleeves, donned old-fashioned attire and performed R dance moves at shows. He wore a yellow tailored suit, while his nine-piece backing band wore black suits. The band included a horn section and backup singer Erika Jerry.|$|E
500|$|Brett Ratner {{was hired}} to direct in September 2002, {{originally}} expressing an interest in casting an unknown for the lead role, while filming was to start sometime in late 2003. Christopher Reeve joined as project consultant, citing Tom Welling, who portrayed the teenage Clark Kent in Smallville, as an ideal candidate. Reeve added [...] "the character {{is more important than}} the actor who plays him, because it is an enduring mythology. It definitely should be an unknown." [...] Ratner approached Josh Hartnett, Jude Law, Paul Walker and Brendan Fraser for Superman, but conceded that finding a famous actor for the title role had proven difficult because of contractual obligations to appear in sequels. [...] "No star wants to sign that, but as much as I've told Jude and Josh my vision for the movie, I've warned them of the consequences of being Superman. They'll live this character for 10 years because I'm telling one story over three movies and plan to direct all three if the first is as successful as everyone suspects." [...] Hartnett in particular was offered $100million for a three-picture deal. Walker explained that [...] "I could have made a gazillion dollars on that franchise. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>probably</b> have bought my own fleet of jets or my own island. You know what? I don't need it." [...] David Boreanaz, Victor Webster and Ashton Kutcher auditioned, along with Keri Russell as Lois Lane, but Kutcher decided not to pursue the role, citing scheduling conflicts with That '70s Show, the Superman curse and fear of typecasting, while Boreanaz had to back out due to obligations with Angel. James Marsden stated in a 2006 interview that at one point he was approached by Ratner. Although it was never formally announced, Matt Bomer confirmed he was in the running for the lead role, being Ratner's preferred choice at the time. Bomer would later voice the character in the 2013 animated film [...] Amy Adams had also auditioned for Lois Lane, and would eventually win the role eight years later when she was cast in Man of Steel.|$|E

2500|$|... "Don't Tell Me" [...] {{was written}} by Madonna, Mirwais Ahmadzaï and Joe Henry, Madonna's brother-in-law. The demo of the song, {{entitled}} [...] "Stop", was first created by Henry at his home studio with string samples. Later, Henry played the demo {{for his wife and}} she said, [...] "You know, I can really hear Madonna singing this song.

[...] However, he claimed, [...] "If I was going to pitch something to her, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>probably</b> dig something up, but it certainly wouldn't be this." [...] Later, his wife sent Madonna a copy of the demo, but it was so musically different from the record she was making that she didn't know how she could make any use out of it. After some time, he was talking to Madonna on the phone and she asked to rearrange the track to fit in better with the album, recording the song months later.

They can write and record at any moment in time, they can get Ray Luzier in to play drums and I can take it {{for a week or two}} and write vocals or sing it. So it's as easy as them kind of recording everything, which is actually probably tough because they're constantly working with Scott on Stone Temple Pilot stuff. So the band is always there, you know what I mean, we're alive, we talk, Dean and I are constantly in communication. Ray Luzier, every time I see him he's like [...] "Man that Army of Anyone record is still, people still come up to me and talk about that Army of Anyone record".

60|$|Before I {{get to the}} higgledy-piggledy point, as Mr. Howells {{suggested}} I do, I want {{to thank}} you, gentlemen, for this very high honor you are doing me, and I am quite competent to estimate it at its value. I see around me captains of all the illustrious industries, most distinguished men; {{there are more than}} fifty here, and I believe I know thirty-nine of them well. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>probably</b> borrow money from--from the others, anyway. It is a proud thing to me, indeed, to see such a distinguished company gather here on such an occasion as this, when there is no foreign prince to be feted--when you have come here not to do honor to hereditary privilege and ancient lineage, but to do reverence to mere moral excellence and elemental veracity-and, dear me, how old it seems to make me! I look around me and I see three or four persons I have known so many, many years. I have known Mr. Secretary Hay--John Hay, as the nation {{and the rest of his}} friends love to call him--I have known John Hay and Tom Reed and the Reverend Twichell close upon thirty-six years. Close upon thirty-six years I have known those venerable men. I have known Mr. Howells nearly thirty-four years, and I knew Chauncey Depew before he could walk straight, and before he learned to tell the truth. Twenty-seven years ago, I heard him make the most noble and eloquent and beautiful speech that has ever fallen from even his capable lips. Tom Reed said that my principal defect was inaccuracy of statement. Well, suppose that that is true. What's the use of telling the truth all the time? I never tell the truth about Tom Reed--but that is his defect, truth; he speaks the truth always. Tom Reed has a good heart, and he has a good intellect, but he hasn't any judgment. Why, when Tom Reed was invited to lecture to the Ladies' Society for the Procreation or Procrastination, or something, of morals, I don't know what it was--advancement, I suppose, of pure morals--he had the immortal indiscretion to begin by saying that some of us can't be optimists, but by judiciously utilizing the opportunities that Providence puts in our way we can all be bigamists. You perceive his limitations. Anything he has in his mind he states, if he thinks it is true. Well, that was true, but that was no place to say it--so they fired him out.|$|E

60|$|I think I may {{modestly}} conclude, {{that whatever}} errors there may be, {{either in the}} design, or writing of this play, they are not those which have been objected to it. I think also, that I am not yet arrived {{to the age of}} doting; and that I have given so much application to this poem, that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>probably</b> let it run into many gross absurdities; which may caution my enemies from too rash a censure, and may also encourage my friends, who are many more than <b>I</b> <b>could</b> reasonably have expected, to believe their kindness has not been very undeservedly bestowed on me. This is not a play that was huddled up in haste; and, to shew it was not, I will own, that, besides the general moral of it, which is given in the four last lines, there is also another moral, couched under every one of the principal parts and characters, which a judicious critic will observe, though I point not to it in this preface. And there may be also some secret beauties in the decorum of parts, and uniformity of design, which my puny judges will not easily find out: let them consider in the last scene of the fourth act, whether I have not preserved the rule of decency, in giving all the advantage to the royal character, and in making Dorax first submit. Perhaps too they may have thought, that it was through indigence of characters that I have given the same to Sebastian and Almeyda, and consequently made them alike in all things but their sex. But let them look a little deeper into the matter, and they will find, that this identity of character in the greatness of their souls was intended for a preparation of the final discovery, and that the likeness of their nature was a fair hint to the proximity of their blood.|$|R
