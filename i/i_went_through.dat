I consider that <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> all stages, from popcorn to dance, club and pop music, so I considered that I have reached a maturity which allows me to release a song which I like, which makes me move in a club and makes me want to hear it on the radio, and I'm very fulfilled.|$|E
25|$|The {{desirability}} of hiring directors over 60 is fairly diminished in this marketplace. At the same time, I hadn't had a good-sized hit {{in quite a}} while. And, frankly, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> a couple of experiences that left me pretty disgusted with it all, and I was thinking the time had passed. I was just sitting at home reading magazines and {{looking out the window}} — a couple of projects I had had just fallen apart — when I got a call from Sly, who had sent me a script.|$|E
25|$|In a June 2016 interview, Kiedis {{stated that}} he at first regretted writing Scar Tissue saying “I did regret the book for a while as there was some pain caused then, I started seeing the long term {{positive}} reverberating. People were reading it in hospitals, in prisons and schools and it was having a positive effect. I realised that {{the whole point of}} writing that book wasn’t for me, but to show that somebody can go all the way down and come all the way back and have a productive, successful happy interesting life. And so whatever shame, pain or difficulty or discomfort <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through,</b> then it was worth it because I get so many people coming up to me saying their kids had read it and got their act together because of it.” Kiedis has stated that due to the subject matter in his book, especially his reflections on his sexual relationships, that he hopes that his family hasn't read his book. “I have asked everyone in my family not to read the book.” Kiedis said.|$|E

Breaking a femur is always serious in itself but an open break in an athlete of high level going flat out, that tears the muscles. At 180 beats , there was a colossal amount of blood being pumped, which meant my leg was full of blood. I'm just grateful that the artery was untouched.|$|E

500|$|The song [...] "Aagadu" [...] {{was filmed}} on Mahesh and few dancers at the Jindal Steel Factory, Bellary in October 2013. This {{became the first}} Telugu film to be shot there and also made the factory a notable {{location}} for the song shoots of Kannada films such as Rana Vikrama (2015), Ranna (2015), and Mr. Airavata (2015). Both the song and fight sequences were filmed in 23 days. Mahesh {{and the members of}} the film's unit had fallen sick and continued work using antibiotics. Mahesh called it the [...] "most strenuous schedule <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> in my life", and added, [...] "For every shot, they had to get the dust up to get the right visual.

Monáe has stated that the album signifies [...] "breaking the chains that enslave minorities of all types". She has said of recording the album, [...] "Overall, this music came from various corners of the world—from Turkey to Prague to Atlanta—places we were on tour. While recording, we’d experiment with different sounds. Once we became engulfed in the sound, we all had an emotional connection to the album. It has definitely transformed my way of thinking, the way that I approach the stage and overall, my life".|$|E

500|$|In 1999, {{the novel}} was adapted into an {{illustrated}} hardback children's book by Janet Schulman, illustrated by Steve Johnson and Lou Fancher, {{and published by}} Simon & Schuster {{as part of its}} [...] "Atheneum Books for Young Readers" [...] imprint. In the adaptation, Schulman attempted to retain some of the lyrical feel of the original novel. She notes that rather than rewrite the novel, she [...] "replicated Salten's language almost completely. I reread the novel a number of times and then <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> and highlighted the dialogue and poignant sentences Salten had written." [...] Doing so retained much of the novel's original lyrical feel, though the book's brevity did result in a sacrifice of some of the [...] "majesty and mystery" [...] found in the novel. The illustrations were created to appear as realistic as possible, using painted images rather than sketches. In 2002, the Schulman adaptation was released in audiobook format by Audio Bookshelf, with Frank Dolan as the reader.|$|E
500|$|Although Cindy Williams {{was cast}} as Laurie Henderson, the actress {{hoped she would}} get the part of Debbie Dunham, which ended up going to Candy Clark. Mackenzie Phillips, who portrays Carol, was only 12 years old, and under California law, {{producer}} Gary Kurtz had to become her legal guardian {{for the duration of}} filming. For Bob Falfa, Roos cast Harrison Ford, who was then concentrating on a carpentry career. Ford agreed to take the role on the condition that he would not have to cut his hair. The character has a flattop in the script, but a compromise was eventually reached whereby Ford wore a stetson to cover his hair. Producer Francis Ford Coppola encouraged Lucas to cast Wolfman Jack as himself in a cameo appearance. [...] "George Lucas and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> thousands of Wolfman Jack phone calls that were taped with the public," [...] Jack reflected.

Lovato has stated that [...] "Don't Forget" [...] {{is one of the}} songs on Don't Forget that she relates to the most, and that she felt [...] "a lot of emotion while recording it". In an interview with PopEater, she elaborated, [...] "Everyone goes through the experience of falling in love, but then the other person just walks away, and goes somewhere else. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>through</b> an experience like that and wanted to write about it. I got over it, and now a year later I don't have those feelings about that person anymore."
