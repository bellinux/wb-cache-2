5|$|A second {{important}} decision in which Owsley was a participant {{was the case}} of Blair, etc. v. Williams, which invalidated the Kentucky Replevin Act of 1820. This law granted debtors a two-year <b>grace</b> <b>period</b> in repaying their debts unless their creditors would accept notes from the Bank of Kentucky. Owsley and his colleagues opined that this law was in violation of the Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The decision was extremely unpopular with the Commonwealth's citizens, but it was re-affirmed by the court's opinion in the related case of Lapsley v. Brashcars and Barr.|$|E

5000|$|Extensive {{changes were}} also {{made to the}} {{possibilities}} for the legal remedy of the failure to observe various time limits within the European patent system. Most particularly, the failure to pay various fees (filing fee, designation fee, search fee and examination fee) were, until the coming into force of the EPC 2000, excluded from the standard legal remedies of further processing [...] and re-establishment of rights. Under the EPC 1973, the failure to observe the time limits for paying these fees could only be remedied by strict <b>grace</b> <b>periods.</b> These <b>grace</b> <b>periods</b> have now {{been replaced by the}} application of further processing [...] and, if the further processing time limit is missed, re-establishment of rights, which although not directly applicable to the time limit missed originally, is applicable to the failure to observe the time limit for further processing.|$|R

5|$|On March 6, 2014, the FCC {{announced}} that it would hold a vote on March 31 on a proposal to ban joint sales agreements involving television stations outright, making them attributable to FCC ownership limits if the senior partner sells 15% or more of advertising time of a competing junior partner station in the JSA; the ban applies to both existing sharing agreements under such a structure as well as pending station transactions that include a JSA. Station owners would be given a two-year <b>grace</b> <b>period</b> to unwind or modify joint sales agreements in violation of the policy; coordinated retransmission consent negotiations between two of the four highest-rated stations in a single market would also be barred under the proposal. Wheeler also proposed an expedited process to review joint sales agreements on a case-by-case basis, granting a waiver of the rules if a broadcaster can prove a particular joint sales agreement arrangement serves the public interest.|$|E
5|$|The IFC makes {{loans to}} {{businesses}} and private projects generally with maturities of seven to twelve years. It determines a suitable repayment schedule and <b>grace</b> <b>period</b> for each loan individually to meet borrowers' currency and cash flow requirements. The IFC may provide longer-term loans or extend grace periods if a project is deemed to warrant it. Leasing companies and financial intermediaries may also receive {{loans from the}} IFC. Though loans have traditionally been denominated in hard currencies, the IFC has endeavored to structure loan products in local currencies. Its disbursement portfolio included loans denominated in 25 local currencies in 2010, and 45 local currencies in 2011, funded largely through swap markets. Local financial markets development is one of IFC’s strategic focus areas. In line with its AAA rating, it has strict concentration, liquidity, asset-liability and other policies. The IFC committed to approximately $5.7 billion in new loans in 2010, and $5 billion in 2011.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish fleet arrived off Roatán at 6am on March 13, {{and after}} its {{defenders}} fired several ineffectual cannon shots, the Santa Maltilda {{and the other}} ships anchored out of range. At 8am Gálvez sent his second-in-command on the 'Santa Matilda' Enrique MacDonell, who spoke English, in to request the surrender of the island's defenders. The defenders asked for six hours to consider their options, which Gálvez granted. After that time had elapsed MacDonell came back with word that the defenders refused to surrender and were prepared to stand their ground 'to the death'. The Spanish were not surprised as their sailors had noticed the English appeared to be preparing defenses during <b>grace</b> <b>period.</b> An Immediate attack was not possible due to high winds and rough seas, so Gálvez then held council of his eleven officers, and a plan of attack was formulated.|$|E
25|$|Usually, if a {{cardholder}} is late {{paying the}} balance, finance charges will be calculated and the <b>grace</b> <b>period</b> does not apply.

One method used to cause payment posting delays was to was to have customers submit payments by mail to a more distant payment center (such as having Ohio customers send their payments to a Arizona address instead of an address in Ohio or even Illinois) or intentionally understaff select payment centers so that it was not possible to process payments very quickly.|$|R
25|$|The court first {{considered}} clause 2.1 in the Development Agreement. They noted that, {{while on}} its face it seemed to create in Burger King a right to terminate {{in the event of}} non-compliance by Hungry Jack's, it was actually subject to a number of qualifications, and that there were other procedures within the agreement for dealing with situations of non-compliance. The court disagreed with Burger King's broad reading of the consequences of a breach of clause 2.1, concluding that such an interpretation would mean that Hungry Jack's could not take advantage of the <b>grace</b> <b>period,</b> and that a narrower view should be preferred. Accordingly, they found that since Burger King had not allowed the 12-month <b>grace</b> <b>period</b> to expire, its termination was not effective.|$|E

50|$|Consolidation loans have longer terms {{than other}} loans. Debtors can choose terms of 10 - 30 years. Although the monthly {{repayments}} are lower, {{the total amount}} paid over the term of the loan is higher than would be paid with other loans. The fixed interest rate is calculated as the weighted average of the interest rates of the loans being consolidated, assigning relative weights according to the amounts borrowed, rounded up to the nearest 0.125%, and capped at 8.25%. Some features of the original consolidated loans, such as postgraduation <b>grace</b> <b>periods</b> and special forgiveness circumstances, are not carried over into the consolidation loan, and consolidation loans are not universally suitable for all debtors.|$|R

5000|$|After 1997, {{there was}} a {{reduction}} in the use of closure policy by Israel, which led to an employment growth and an expansion of the West Bank and Gaza economy. After the signing of the Wye River Memorandum, a new donors' conference was convened, and over $2 billion was pledged to the PNA for 1999-2003. Nevertheless, overall donor disbursements fell in 1998-2000, and the 1998 disbursements=to-commitments ratio was the lowest since 1994. As for international institutions, they began to play a bigger role in the international funding process, in spite of the decline in the absolute value of these institutions' total commitments. After 1997, the need for donor support for the current budget and employment generation programs receded due to the PA's improved fiscal performance, and attention was focused instead on infrastructures to the detriment of institution building. Donors' activity was also characterized by a decline in support for PNGOs, and by a preference to concessionary loans (instead of grants) with generous <b>grace</b> <b>periods,</b> long repayment periods and low interest rates ...|$|R
40|$|This {{past year}} has seen {{significant}} increases in RCU’s realtime capabilities, particularly the ability to preempt RCU read-side critical sections. There have even been some cases where use of RCU improved realtime latency (and performance and scalability as well), in contrast to earlier implementations, which seemed only {{to get in the}} way of realtime response. That said, there is still considerable room for improvement, including (1) loweroverhead rcu_read_lock() and rcu_read_ unlock() primitives, (2) more scalable graceperiod detection, (3) better balance of throughput and latency for RCU callback invocation, (4) lower per-structure memory overhead and (5) priority boosting of RCU read-side critical sections. This latter is needed to prevent lowpriority tasks from blocking <b>grace</b> <b>periods,</b> resulting in out-of-memory events, due to being preempted for too long while in an RCU readside critical section. This paper describes ongoing work to address these five issues, including some interesting failures in addition to a number of unexpected successes. The ultimate goal of providing a single RCU implementation that covers all workloads is tantalizingly close, but is not yet within our grasp. It is safe to say that the very wide variety of workloads supported by Linux TM provides substantial challenges to the design and implementation of synchronization primitives like RCU!...|$|R
40|$|Timely {{disclosure}} of financial statement information {{is a critical}} requirement for firms and well-functioning capital markets. Yet, every quarter or year, a non-trivial number of firms are late in filing their financial statements. This paper identifies and probes various capital market consequences for late filings of quarterly and annual financial statements. It examines the short- and long-window reaction to late filings, {{as well as how}} equity investors process statements accompanying late filing announcements, such as managers declaring intentions to file within/outside SEC’s allowed <b>grace</b> <b>periods.</b> The paper documents that delayed quarterly filings have distinctly different valuation implications than delayed annual filings over the short and long run, and that accounting problems play a unique role in signaling the seriousness of the delay. It also shows that investors do not accept managements’ delay-related assertions at face value, and that delayed filing announcements signal continued poor performance that is not fully reflected in stock prices at the time the announcements are made. One particularly surprising finding is that stock prices drop significantly as soon as firms signal late statement filings via the regulatory form, even when management declares it will meet the extended deadline. Overall, this paper sheds new light on important capital market consequences of filing financial statements late...|$|R
