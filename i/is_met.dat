Delhi's groundwater level is falling and its population density is increasing, so residents often encounter acute water shortage. Research on Delhi suggests that {{up to half of}} the city's water use is unofficial groundwater.In Delhi, daily domestic solid waste production is 8000tonnes which is dumped at three landfill locations by MCD. The daily domestic waste water production is 470MGD and industrial waste water is 70MGD. A large portion of the sewage flows untreated into the Yamuna river.|$|E

5|$|Providing an {{adequate}} water supply for Hong Kong {{has always been}} difficult because the region has few natural lakes and rivers, inadequate groundwater sources (inaccessible in most cases due to the hard granite bedrock found in most areas in the territory), a high population density, and extreme seasonable variations in rainfall. Thus about 70 percent of water demand <b>is</b> <b>met</b> by importing water from the Dongjiang River in neighbouring Guangdong province. In addition, freshwater demand is curtailed {{by the use of}} seawater for toilet flushing, using a separate distribution system.|$|E
5|$|Ranging {{behavior}} can also exhibit seasonal variability. During the hot, wet season, females range widely, either {{alone or in}} groups of up to six individuals. In the cool, dry season, smaller core groups stabilize in order to occupy concentrated areas. Therefore, during seasons when fruit is abundant, subgroups are larger while scarcity <b>is</b> <b>met</b> with more solitary behavior. This suggests that although their feeding ecology is inflexible, being tied to widely distributed, patchy, and sometimes scarce fruit, ruffed lemurs instead adapt the social system in order to survive.|$|E
