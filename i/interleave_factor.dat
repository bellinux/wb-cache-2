One notable peculiarity of these modes is a direct result of Apple founder Steve Wozniak's chip-saving design. Many home computer systems of the time (as well as today's PC-compatible machines) had architecture which assigned consecutive blocks of memory to non-consecutive rows on the screen in graphic modes, i.e., interleaving. Apple's text and graphics modes are based on two different <b>interleave</b> <b>factors</b> of 8:1 and 64:1.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we explore}} the loss {{behavior}} encountered in transmitting real-time {{voice over the}} Internet and propose a new loss-concealment scheme to improve its received quality. One known technique to conceal loss is to send interleaved streams of voice samples and reconstruct missing or late samples by interpolation at the receiver. Based on this method, we propose a new transformation-based reconstruction algorithm. Its basic idea is for the sender to transform an input voice stream, according to the interpolation method used at the receiver and the predicted loss behavior, before interleaving the stream. The transformation is derived by minimizing reconstruction error in case of loss. We show that our method is computationally efficient and can be extended to various <b>interleaving</b> <b>factors</b> and interpolation-based reconstruction methods. Finally, we show performance improvements of our method by testing it over the Internet. Index Terms — Interleaving, Internet, linear interpolation...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{identifies}} the trade-offs encountered in transmitting images in real-time over the Internet and proposes two approaches to solve them. Image delivery over the Internet can use either the TCP or the UDP protocol. Delivery by TCP causes no image quality degradations, but has long delays {{when there are}} packet losses. On the other hand, although UDP has shorter delays, its delivery is not preferred {{because it does not}} recover lost packets during transmission, thus causing serious quality degradations. In this thesis, we address the quality-delay trade-offs by using multiple description coding (MDC) and unequal error protection (UEP), together with the UDP protocol, to deliver JPEG 2000 images over the Internet. We first analyze Internet traffic data and determine a proper <b>interleaving</b> <b>factor</b> by which UDP packets are interleaved in order for losses to be below a certain threshold. We then propose an MDC scheme with a new reconstruction strategy carried out in the frequency domain, thereby avoiding sample-domain segmentation, which is a major cause for performance degradations in previous sample-domain MDC schemes. An optimized reconstruction-based transform for the new scheme is also derived and incorporated into our proposed MD...|$|R

Delivery by TCP gives superior decoding quality but with very long delays when the network is unreliable, whereas delivery by UDP has negligible delays but with degraded quality when packets are lost.

40|$|High-speed analog-to-digital {{converters}} (ADCs) are key enabling {{blocks for}} emerging wideband applications in communication, high-end instrumentation, and medical imaging. Larger signaling bandwidth improves system performance and necessitates high-speed ADCs for accurate digitization. As an example, current state-of-the-art oscilloscopes have an acquisition bandwidth exceeding 60 GHz with effective sample rates greater than 100 GS/s. This places significant difficulty {{in the design}} of sample-and-hold (S/H) and analog-to-digital conversion circuitry that can operate at such high speeds while providing moderate resolution. As a result, the front-end of these systems are often complex, multi-chip solutions that are fabricated in expensive processes such as indium-phosphide (InP). With the increased demand for battery-operable, low-power systems it is desirable to have these high-performance signal acquisition systems in a fully-integrated CMOS implementation in order to harness the power of scaling as dictated by Moore's law. To achieve this, several advancements on current data conversion techniques need to be made. In this thesis, we explore the design and optimization of a frequency-interleaved ADC (FI-ADC) as an alternative to conventional high-speed ADC architectures, which are often heavily time-interleaved. Due to the large <b>interleaving</b> <b>factor</b> and timing sensitivity, the conventional architectures are often very power hungry and offer typical resolutions of 4 bits or less. FI-ADCs, in which the input signal is divided into various frequency bands which are independently digitized and digitally recombined, show less susceptibility to jitter, the primary bottleneck in high-speed ADCs. System simulations have shown a potential improvement in SNR performance for a frequency-interleaved ADC versus a direct sampling, time-interleaved architecture. The focus of this thesis is to provide a fundamental understanding of the operation of the FI-ADC and investigate the similarities and differences to the conventional time-interleaved ADC in respect to design complexity, design challenges and overall performance...|$|R

40|$|Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) {{serve as}} the {{interfaces}} between the analog natural world and the binary world of computer data. Due to this essential role, ADC circuits have been well studied over 40 years, and many problems associated with them have already been solved. However in recent years, a new species of ADCs has appeared, and since then attracted lots of attention. These are ultra-high-speed (often greater than 40 GS/s) time-interleaved ADCs of low or medium resolution (around 6 to 8 bit) built in CMOS processes. Although such ADCs {{can be used in}} high-speed electronic measurement equipment and radar systems, the recent driving force behind them is next generation 100 Gbps/ 400 Gbps fiber optical transceivers. These transceivers take advantage of ultra-high-speed ADCs and digital-signal-processors (DSPs) to enable ultra-high data-rate communications in long-haul networks (city-to-city, transcontinental, and transoceanic fiber links), metro networks (fibers that connect enterprises in metropolitan areas), and data centers (fiber links within data center infrastructures). At such high sampling rate, massively time-interleaved successive-approximation ADC (SAR ADC) architecture has emerged as the dominant solution due to its excellent power efficiency. Several recent works has demonstrated success in achieving high sampling rate. However, the sampling network has become the bottleneck that limits the input bandwidth in these ADCs. It is apparent that conventional switch-based track-and-hold (T&H) circuit cannot satisfy the > 20 GHz bandwidth requirement. In addition, it is unclear what the optimal interleaving configuration is. Each state-of-the-art design adopts a different interleaving configuration – from straightforward conventional 1 -rank interleaving to 2 -rank hierarchical sampling or even 3 ranks. How to partition <b>interleaving</b> <b>factors</b> among different ranks has not yet been investigated. Furthermore, asynchronous SAR sub-ADCs are often used in these designs to push the sampling rate even further. The well-known sparkle-code issues caused by comparator meta-stability in asynchronous SARs can significantly increase the Bit-Error-Rate (BER) of the transceivers unless power hungry error correction coding are implemented in the system. Although many works in the literature attempted to deal with the meta-stability in asynchronous SARs, the effectiveness of these approaches have not been fully demonstrated. In this thesis, I will first propose a new cascode-based T&H circuits to improve the ADC bandwidth beyond the limit of conventional switch-based T&H circuits. Then, a system design and optimization methodology of hierarchical time-interleaved sampling network is presented in the context of cascode T&H. To deal with sparkle-code issue in asynchronous SAR sub-ADCs, a new back-end meta-stability correction technique is employed. An extensive statistical analysis is provided to verify the correction algorithm can greatly reduce sparkle-code error-rates. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed circuits and techniques, two prototype ADCs have been implemented. The first 7 b 12. 5 GS/s hierarchically time-interleaved ADC in 65 nm CMOS process demonstrates 29. 4 dB SNDR and > 25 GHz bandwidth. The later 6 b 46 GS/s ADC in 28 nm CMOS employs asynchronous SAR sub-ADC design with back-end meta-stability correction. The measurement results show it achieves sparkle-code error free operation over 1 e 10 samples in addition to achieving > 23 GHz bandwidth and 25. 2 dB SNDR. The power consumption is 381 mW from 1. 05 V/ 1. 6 V supplies, and the FOM is 0. 56 pJ/conversion-step...|$|R
