5|$|The {{elements}} in group 12 are usually {{considered to be}} d-block elements, but not transition elements as the d-shell is full. Some authors classify these elements as main-group elements because the valence electrons are in ns2 orbitals. Nevertheless, they share many characteristics with the neighboring group 11 elements on the periodic table, which are almost universally considered to be transition elements. For example, zinc shares many characteristics with the neighboring transition metal, copper. Zinc complexes merit inclusion in the Irving-Williams series as zinc forms many complexes with the same stoichiometry as complexes of copper(II), albeit with smaller stability constants. There is little similarity between cadmium and silver as compounds of silver(II) are rare {{and those that do}} exist are very strong oxidizing agents. Likewise the common oxidation state for gold is +3, which precludes there being much common chemistry between mercury and gold, though there are similarities between mercury(I) and gold(I) such as the formation of linear dicyano complexes, −. According to IUPAC's definition of transition metal as an element whose atom has an incomplete d sub-shell, or which can give rise to cations with an incomplete d sub-shell, zinc and cadmium are not transition metals, while mercury <b>is.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> because only mercury is known to have a compound where its oxidation state is higher than +2, in mercury(IV) fluoride (though its existence is disputed, as later experiments trying to confirm its synthesis could not find evidence of HgF4). However, this classification is based on one highly atypical compound seen at non-equilibrium conditions and is at odds to mercury's more typical chemistry, and Jensen has suggested {{that it would be better}} to regard mercury as not being a transition metal.|$|E
25|$|Usually, the {{stronger}} a metal is, the less pliable it <b>is.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> {{not the case}} with copper. A unique combination of high strength and high ductility makes copper ideal for wiring systems. At junction boxes and at terminations, for example, copper can be bent, twisted, and pulled without stretching or breaking.|$|E

25|$|In chemistry, {{there are}} five {{important}} symmetry operations. The identity operation (E) consists of leaving the molecule as it <b>is.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> equivalent to any number of full rotations around any axis. This is a symmetry of all molecules, whereas the symmetry group of a chiral molecule consists of only the identity operation. Rotation around an axis (Cn) consists of rotating the molecule around a specific axis by a specific angle. For example, if a water molecule rotates 180° around the axis that passes through the oxygen atom and between the hydrogen atoms, {{it is in the}} same configuration as it started. In this case, , since applying it twice produces the identity operation. Other symmetry operations are: reflection, inversion and improper rotation (rotation followed by reflection).|$|E
25|$|Knowing {{the meaning}} of a lexical item {{therefore}} means knowing the semantic entailments the word brings with it. However, it is also possible to understand only one word of a semantic field without understanding other related words. Take, for example, a taxonomy of plants and animals: it is possible to understand the words rose and rabbit without knowing what a marigold or a muskrat <b>is.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> applicable to colors as well, such as understanding the word red without knowing {{the meaning of}} scarlet, but understanding scarlet without knowing the meaning of red may be less likely. A semantic field can thus be very large or very small, depending on the level of contrast being made between lexical items. While cat and dog both fall under the larger semantic field of animal, including the breed of dog, like German shepherd, would require contrasts between other breeds of dog (e.g. corgi, or poodle), thus expanding the semantic field further.|$|E
500|$|Like other Iskut-Unuk River Cones, The Volcano is not {{monitored}} closely {{enough by}} the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active its magma system <b>is.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> {{partly because it}} {{is located in a}} remote region and no major eruptions have occurred in Canada in the past few hundred years. [...] As a result, volcano monitoring is less important than dealing with other natural processes, including tsunamis, earthquakes and landslides. However, with the existence of earthquakes, further volcanism is expected and would probably have effects on the surrounding landscape. Because of these concerns, significant support from Canadian university scientists have resulted in the construction of a baseline of knowledge on the state of volcanoes in Canada.|$|E

500|$|By 1989, the Peace Candle {{had become}} so {{dilapidated}} that it was hardly able to sustain the winter weather. Strong winds in November had shaken the structure {{so much that the}} wax dripping fixtures atop the candle had fallen off. On November 16, 1989, Mayor Sal Panto Jr. announced on WEST's Voice of the People show that the Peace Candle would not go up another year because the support structure was too weak and the Easton Area Christmas Committee was not receiving enough donations to pay for repairs. The committee was now receiving an average of $3,000 a year in donations, which was used to maintain the existing candle. Panto said, [...] "The sad reality <b>is,</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the last year." [...] However, new fundraising efforts were started to raise $20,000 to build a new Peace Candle. Local businesses and unions volunteered their time and materials to work on it, with the Lehigh Valley Carpenters Union working up to 100 hours a week for about five weeks to have the candle ready for the 1990 holiday season.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Hidden Place" [...] was {{directed}} by Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin and co-directed by M/M (Paris). It was shot in London over four days in February 2001. It was originally planned for a song from Selmasongs, but Björk felt the project was more appropriate for Vespertine. The video consists of close-up shots panning around Björk's face, as fluids flow {{in and out of}} her facial orifices. M/M (Paris) explained the concept behind the video:We always wanted to get as close to her as we could, as we all felt she had never been portrayed as the [...] "real" [...] and beautiful woman she <b>is.</b> <b>This</b> <b>is</b> somehow taboo, to observe a pop star with no makeup from a distance of half an inch.

500|$|In {{reporting}} on Ballo's death, United Press International noted, [...] "Critics say the break-you-down-build-you-up recruitment tool of Scientologists is controversial." [...] The issue received {{a significant amount}} of coverage in Norway news publications; and media attention focused criticism on the Church of Scientology. Both Verdens Gang and Dagbladet devoted several cover stories investigating the matter. News media received criticism regarding the amount of coverage given to the incident. A representative of the National Association for Suicide Survivors in Norway regarded it as excessive. News editor of Dagbladet, Peter Raaum, defended the amount of news coverage given to the incident: [...] "We write about this because the survivor has made criticism of the Scientology test that Kaja took just before she took her life. The family wanted a debate about this. What makes this so important is this test. What kind of test <b>is</b> <b>this?</b> <b>Is</b> it so reprehensible, and significant to what happened? If it is, I mean it's something that's extremely important to focus on." [...] Ballo's family agreed to discuss the incident with the media.
