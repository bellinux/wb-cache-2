40|$|In this paper, thick <b>film</b> <b>chip</b> {{resistors}} {{with two}} different types of solder alloys namely SnPb and SnAgCu have been evaluated for the effects of the solder alloy elemental composition on the solder joint failures under cyclic temperature loading conditions. The creep properties of both solders have been modelled using the Garofalo equation and the creep strain energy density has been extracted and used as the damage indicator for lifetime prediction. Three thick <b>film</b> <b>chip</b> resistors of different sizes have been modelled and the effect of device size on the failures in the solder joints has been analysed. In addition, both thermal cycling and thermal shock conditions have been modelled in order to simulate effects of extreme harsh conditions and the total damage has been calculated using the Miner's law of linear damage accumulation. Based on the modelling results, the most vulnerable places in the solder joints where the failures may originate and propagate have been identified. Empirical lifetime models have used to predict the life time of the resistor solder joints...|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{continuous}} trend of miniaturization and high density interconnect PCBs, chip resistors are getting smaller and smaller. The resistive layer dimensions {{have been reduced}} and its small thickness is dependant by the technological manufacturing process, therefore transient electrical events like Electrostatic Discharge Pulses (ESD) can change the initial properties of the resistive layer, {{which leads to a}} modification of the resistance value or damaging the layer, causing chip resistor failure. This paper presents an analysis for the thermal and electrical behavior of thick and thin <b>film</b> <b>chip</b> resistors, by applying DC- current and rectangular pulses of short width and high voltage and current amplitudes.

40|$|A {{quantitative}} analysis of thick <b>film</b> <b>chip</b> resistors is presented regarding design and construction. Critical reliability and performance data are compared for two techniques used to adjust final resistance tolerance — abrasive trimming and laser trimming. Additional enhanced performance characteristics are discussed for diamond sawing versus laser scribing methods of die separation, and 3 -sided versus 5 -sided surface mount terminations, including nickel barrier and solderability aspects. This analysis will provide vital information for component engineers working with parts specifications for thick film passive components. Additionally, specification guidelines are defined based upon each given packaging and electrical application for optimum performance {{and reliability of}} a thick film passive component. These guidelines are specified for applications involving epoxy die attach, eutectic die attach, wire bonding, and surface mount reflow soldering. Some typical pitfalls that occur when using an incorrectly specified component for a given application are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Inorganic-organic {{polymers}} with {{barrier properties}} against water vapor, excellent electrical data and good adhesion to various substrate materials have been developed. Tailored modifications {{of these materials}} provide an excellent protective coating for thin film capacitors. Several mm thick, expensive, encapsulations could be replaced by thin coatings. The polymer coating allows the use of thin <b>film</b> <b>chip</b> capacitors in surface-mount technology. As a measure for {{the efficiency of the}} coating, the capacitance decrease under controlled humidity has been used. The influence of the material composition, the type of catalyst during sol-gel processing and the curing conditions have been studied. Adhesion and water vapor permeation properties of the polymers and rheological properties of the coating solutions have been investigated. A protective coating is developed, which increases the withstandnesss of capacitors against humid conditions by a factor of about 30 (compared to uncoated capacitors) and shows no crack formation during thermal cycling...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} issues of resistors properties is the value stability under different electrical and non electrical influences. Mechanical and/or thermal stress together with the electrical one represents the main factors that have a major contribution in resistor value stability. With shrinking resistor geometries of discrete, integrated and integral passives, the electrical stress gains more and more importance, especially under short duration voltage pulses. The analytical test technique of transmission line pulsers (TLP) allows, on the basis of square pulses, the in-situ monitoring of the voltages and currents at the DUT during pulsing and helps to gain fundamental insights into the electrical behavior. The influence of the pulse width and height on the current-voltage behavior was investigated on thick <b>film</b> <b>chip</b> resistors of different values and sizes.
