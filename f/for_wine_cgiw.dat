40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to reveal the shifts in climate {{suitability}} <b>for</b> <b>wine</b> production affecting Romanian <b>wine</b> growing regions. <b>For</b> this, we analyzed the spatial distribution over Romanian territory of the oenoclimate aptitude index (IAOe) for the 1961 to 1990 and 1991 to 2013 time periods. The IAOe has been calculated based on gridded data at 10 × 10 [*]km resolution of average daily temperature, precipitation and sunshine duration between 1961 – 2013, originating from about 150 weather stations across Romanian territory and recorded in the ROCADA database. The study reveals: northward shifts and to higher altitudes of suitability <b>for</b> <b>wine</b> production; the appearance of new areas suitable <b>for</b> <b>wine</b> production; the expansion or the shrinkage of the current areas suitable <b>for</b> <b>wine</b> production; shifts in classes of suitability <b>for</b> <b>wine</b> production in the current wine regions and appearance of premises of replacing their specific varieties and traditional wine type production; the tendency to level climate suitability at regional scale by diminishing suitability <b>for</b> white <b>wines</b> and replacing it with climate suitability <b>for</b> red <b>wines.</b> The study provides a solid support for developing strategies to adapt Romanian viticulture to climate change...|$|R
40|$|The demand <b>for</b> <b>wine</b> is {{generally}} estimated on an aggregate level {{as a single}} commodity. How-ever, as recent history shows us, the demand <b>for</b> <b>wine</b> not only varies considerably by varietal, but also by price point within each varietal. As a result, although estimates of the demand <b>for</b> <b>wine</b> may be benefi cial to the wine industry as a whole, they provide little benefi t to individual wine pro-ducers. Using scan data of purchases from US retail chain stores, this paper uses store keeping unit (sku) level data to overcome the limitations of prior research on the demand <b>for</b> <b>wine</b> by providing estimates for the demand <b>for</b> <b>wine</b> by varietal and price point. We also provide estimates of own price effects, income effects as well as cross price effects by color, varietal and price point.
