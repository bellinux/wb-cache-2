25|$|The speed, {{and thus}} the kinetic energy of a single object is frame-dependent (relative): it can take any non-negative value, by {{choosing}} a suitable inertial frame of reference. For example, a bullet passing an observer has kinetic energy in the reference frame of this observer. The same bullet is stationary {{from the point of}} view of an observer moving with the same velocity as the bullet, and so has zero kinetic energy. By contrast, the total kinetic energy of a system of objects cannot be reduced to zero by a suitable choice of the <b>inertial</b> <b>reference</b> frame, unless all the objects have the same velocity. In any other case the total kinetic energy has a non-zero minimum, as no <b>inertial</b> <b>reference</b> frame can be chosen in which all the objects are stationary. This minimum kinetic energy contributes to the system's invariant mass, which is independent of the reference frame.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the theory}} of relativity, due to their {{constant}} movement and height relative to the Earth-centered, non-rotating approximately <b>inertial</b> <b>reference</b> frame, the clocks on the satellites are affected by their speed. Special relativity predicts that the frequency of the atomic clocks moving at GPS orbital speeds will tick more slowly than stationary ground clocks by a factor of , or result in a delay of about 7 μs/day, where the orbital velocity is v = 4km/s, and c = the speed of light. The time dilation effect has been measured and verified using the GPS.|$|E
25|$|In {{practical}} terms, the equivalence of <b>inertial</b> <b>reference</b> frames {{means that}} scientists within a box moving uniformly cannot determine their absolute velocity by any experiment (otherwise the differences {{would set up}} an absolute standard reference frame). According to this definition, supplemented with the constancy {{of the speed of}} light, inertial frames of reference transform among themselves according to the Poincaré group of symmetry transformations, of which the Lorentz transformations are a subgroup. In Newtonian mechanics, which {{can be viewed as a}} limiting case of special relativity in which the speed of light is infinite, inertial frames of reference are related by the Galilean group of symmetries.|$|E
25|$|After {{detailed}} {{forensic analysis}} of the FDR data, the flight control primary computer (FCPC) software and the air data <b>inertial</b> <b>reference</b> unit (ADIRU), {{it was determined that}} the CPU of the ADIRU corrupted the angle of attack (AOA) data. The exact nature was that the ADIRU CPU erroneously relabelled the altitude data word so that the binary data that represented 37,012 (the altitude {{at the time of the}} incident) would represent an angle of attack of 50.625 degrees. The FCPC then processed the erroneously high AOA data, triggering the high-AOA protection mode, which sent a command to the electrical flight control system (EFCS) to pitch the nose down.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is shown}} that [...] remains true in {{relativistic}} calculation despite other differences.

25|$|The {{problems}} {{involved are}} not always so trivial. Special relativity predicts that an observer in an <b>inertial</b> <b>reference</b> frame doesn't see objects he would describe as moving faster {{than the speed of}} light. However, in the non-inertial reference frame of Earth, treating a spot on the Earth as a fixed point, the stars are observed to move in the sky, circling once about the Earth per day. Since the stars are light years away, this observation means that, in the non-inertial reference frame of the Earth, anybody who looks at the stars is seeing objects which appear, to them, to be moving faster than the speed of light.|$|E
25|$|They {{supersede}} the Galilean {{transformation of}} Newtonian physics, which assumes an absolute {{space and time}} (see Galilean relativity). The Galilean transformation is a good approximation only at relative speeds {{much smaller than the}} speed of light. Lorentz transformations have a number of unintuitive features that do not appear in Galilean transformations. For example, they reflect the fact that observers moving at different velocities may measure different distances, elapsed times, and even different orderings of events, but always such that the speed of light is the same in all <b>inertial</b> <b>reference</b> frames. The invariance of light speed is one of the postulates of special relativity.|$|E
25|$|An {{inertial}} frame of reference, in classical physics, is {{a frame of}} reference in which bodies, whose net force acting upon them is zero, are not accelerated, that is they are at rest or they move at a constant velocity in a straight line. In analytical terms, it is a frame of reference that describes time and space homogeneously, isotropically, and in a time-independent manner. Conceptually, in classical physics and special relativity, the physics of a system in an {{inertial frame}} have no causes external to the system.
