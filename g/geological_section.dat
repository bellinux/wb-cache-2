2500|$|Darwin overcame illness {{to attend}} the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting at Oxford in May 1847, to discuss the [...] "Sketch" [...] with Hooker. Darwin {{attended}} the <b>geological</b> <b>section</b> which featured a talk by Robert Chambers on ancient beaches. An observer at the meeting reported that Chambers [...] "pushed his conclusions to a most unwarrantable length and got roughly handled on account of it by Buckland, De la Beche, Sedgwick, Murchison, and Lyell. The last told me afterwards that he did so purposely that [...] might see that reasonings {{in the style of}} the author of the Vestiges would not be tolerated among scientific men." [...] This was a clear warning from Darwin's Cambridge friends.|$|E
2500|$|In 1815 he {{published}} the first geological map of Britain, {{based on a}} John Cary map. It covered the whole of England and Wales, and parts of Scotland. While {{this was not the}} world's first geological map (a map of the United States by William Maclure was published six years earlier), Smith's was the first geological map covering such a large area. [...] Conventional symbols were used to mark canals, tunnels, tramways and roads, collieries, lead, copper and tin mines, together with salt and alum works. The various geological types were indicated by different colours, applied by hand. Nevertheless, the map is remarkably similar to modern geological maps of England. He published his Delineation of the Strata of England in the same year. [...] In another of his books Strata Identified by Organized Fossils (London 1816-1819) he recognised that strata contained distinct fossil assemblages which could be used to match rocks across regions. In 1817 he drew a remarkable <b>geological</b> <b>section</b> from Snowdon to London.|$|E

It was also stated by Mr. S. B. J. Skertchley in his Physical System of the Universe, p. 363 (1878); but we both founded it on what I now consider the erroneous doctrine that actual glacial epochs recurred each 10,500 years during periods of high excentricity.|$|E

60|$|If then, {{there be}} {{some degree of}} truth in these remarks, we {{have no right to}} expect to find in our {{geological}} formations, an infinite number of those fine transitional forms, which on my theory assuredly have connected all the past and present species of the same group into one long and branching chain of life. We ought only to look for a few links, some more closely, some more distantly related to each other; and these links, let them be ever so close, if found in different stages of the same formation, would, by most palaeontologists, be ranked as distinct species. But I do not pretend that I should ever have suspected how poor a record of the mutations of life, the best preserved <b>geological</b> <b>section</b> presented, had not the difficulty of our not discovering innumerable transitional links between the species which appeared at the commencement and close of each formation, pressed so hardly on my theory.|$|E
60|$|My route lay {{along the}} east flank, {{overhanging}} {{the valley of the}} Rungmo river. Looking east, the amphitheatre of hills from the ridge I had crossed was very fine; enclosing an area some four miles across and 4000 feet deep, clothed throughout with an impenetrable, dark forest: there was not one clear patch except near the very bottom, where were some scattered hamlets of two or three huts each. The rock is everywhere near the surface, and the road has been formed by blasting at very many places. A wooded slope descends suddenly {{from the edge of the}} road, while, on the other hand, a bank rises abruptly to the top of the ridge, alternately mossy, rocky, and clayey, and presenting a good <b>geological</b> <b>section,</b> all the way along, of the nucleus of Dorjiling spur, exposing broken masses of gneiss. As I descended, I came upon the upper limit of the chesnut, a tree second in abundance to the oak; gigantic, tall, and straight in the trunk.|$|E
60|$|Pundim has a {{tremendous}} precipice to the south, which, to judge from its bareness of snow, must be nearly perpendicular; and it presented a superb <b>geological</b> <b>section.</b> The height of this precipice I found by angles with a pocket sextant to be upwards of 3,400 feet, and that of its top to be 21,300 above the sea, and consequently only 715 feet {{less than that of}} the summit of Pundim itself (which is 22,015 feet). This cliff is of black stratified rocks, sloping to the west, and probably striking north-west; permeated from top to bottom by veins of white granite, disposed in zigzag lines, which produce a contortion of the gneiss, and give it a marbled appearance. The same structure may be seen in miniature on the transported blocks which abound in the Sikkim rivers; where veins of finely grained granite are forced in all directions through the gneiss, and form parallel seams or beds between the laminae of that rock, united by transverse seams, and crumpling up the gneiss itself, like the crushed leaves of a book. The summit of Pundim itself is all of white rock, rounded in shape, and forming a cap to the gneiss, which weathers into precipices.|$|E

60|$|It is all-important to {{remember}} that naturalists have no golden rule by which to distinguish species and varieties; they grant some little variability to each species, but when they meet with a somewhat greater amount of difference between any two forms, they rank both as species, unless they are enabled to connect them together by the closest intermediate gradations; and this, from the reasons just assigned, we can seldom hope to effect in any one <b>geological</b> <b>section.</b> Supposing B and C to be two species, and a third, A, {{to be found in}} an older and underlying bed; even if A were strictly intermediate between B and C, it would simply be ranked as a third and distinct species, unless {{at the same time it}} could be closely connected by intermediate varieties with either one or both forms. Nor should it be forgotten, as before explained, that A might be the actual progenitor of B and C, and yet would not necessarily be strictly intermediate between them in all respects. So that we might obtain the parent-species and its several modified descendants from the lower and upper beds of the same formation, and unless we obtained numerous transitional gradations, we should not recognise their blood-relationship, and should consequently rank them as distinct species.|$|E
