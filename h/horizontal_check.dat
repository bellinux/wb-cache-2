This paper proposed the implement of {{hydraulic control system}} for large-scale railway maintenance equipment based on PLC. This implement pursued the purpose of accurate control of hydraulic working units of large-scale railway maintenance equipment. Large-scale railway maintenance equipment should always work in efficient statement. Focusing on this requirement, the reliability design of hardware for current leakage and impulse current which is proposed in the paper is necessary. This paper proposed Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) for relative <b>horizontal</b> <b>check</b> of working units linking bridge. This paper also proposed the method to prevent the current leakage and impulse current. As for hydraulic valves, this paper proposed PID algorithm to realize the control of Analogue Closed-Loop...|$|E
40|$|This article {{applies the}} principal-agent model {{to examine the}} {{discretion}} of the European External Action Service (EEAS) agent vis-à-vis the Member State (MS) principals in the negotiation of the EU-Moldova Association Agreement including the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA). The EEAS was allocated various responsibilities in each of these policy areas. While the EEAS is in charge of negotiations on political association, it does not lead in the area of free trade talks; the Directorate General for Trade of the European Commission plays a greater role in this process. Moreover, in the areas of sectoral cooperation pertinent to the EU-Moldova Association Agreement, the EEAS has to rely extensively on the expertise of the European Commission's Directorates General. The European Commission therefore functions as a <b>horizontal</b> <b>check</b> with regard to the EEAS. The article finds that in order to monitor and control the EEAS' action throughout the negotiation of the EU-Moldova Association Agreement, the MS employ ex ante and ex post mechanisms. The control exercised by the MS and the checks applied by the Commission considerably limit the EEAS' discretion in pursuing the Association Agreement and the DCFTA between the EU and Moldova. Besides applying the principal-agent model, the original empirical research of this article contributes {{to the understanding of the}} EU's post-Lisbon foreign policy institutional architecture...|$|E
40|$|A {{test area}} close to Philadelphia, USA, has been flown with an UltraCamX from the extreme low flying {{elevation}} of 310 m above ground. This leads to images with 22 mm ground sampling distance (GSD). The required end lap of 60 % corresponds just to 84 m. The imaging {{sequence of the}} UltraCamX with 1. 6 sec enables with the minimal flying speed of 220 km/hour only a base of 98 m, by this reason each flight line was flown twice {{in the same direction}} at 20 % end lap. In this way combining the 2 flights per strip a 60 % end lap was achieved. The area is covered also at 60 % lateral overlap. 44 targeted ground control points {{with a standard deviation of}} the coordinate components of 1. 5 cm and better are available in the 210 used images. An automatic aerial triangulation with LPS has been made. Detailed analysis with the Hannover program for bundle block adjustment BLUH showed systematic image errors requiring an improvement of the UltraCam-specific additional parameters. Finally by bundle adjustment with self calibration a standard deviation of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>check</b> point coordinates of approximately 14 mm corresponding to 0. 6 GSD and in Z up to 26 mm corresponding to 1. 2 GSD has been reached for the check points measured in the average in 6 images. This extreme accuracy is limited by the identification and the accuracy of the ground control and check points. The TDI was able to compensate the very fast forward motion; no obvious reduced image quality in flight direction could be seen. Radiometric image quality for these high resolution images were also conducted by assessing the image quality in terms of edge analysis. This allows the determination of the effective resolution for the panchromatic and the pan-sharpened images. 1...|$|E

40|$|Fragile {{states are}} characterised {{by a great}} {{potential}} for crisis that endangers human security and {{the achievement of the}} Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It is increasingly being recognized that external actors should stay involved, either directly or indirectly; at the same time, though, new entry points and approaches are needed (the stay engaged, but differently principle). Donor behavior in cases of fragile statehood can be based on two key parameters: (a) the effectiveness of state institutions, (b) the legitimacy of the respective government. In order not to create parallel and hybrid structures, donors are well-advised, in general, to focus on existing structures and coordinate their political priorities with the governments (systems and policy alignment). However, lack of development orientation, widespread corruption, or markedly repressive rule may make such a cooperation a highly problematic proposition. Thus, it will in a substantial number of cases also be necessary to engage with partners beyond the state, i. e. with nonstate groups, the private sector, and local governmental units. A major task for development cooperation is the (re-) creation of capabilities in six governance arenas: security, political, judicial, administrative, social, and economic governance. This must be approached on a country-by-country basis, based on empirical assessments of the current situation, and preferably drawing on the knowledge of local experts. Despite this qualification some cross-cutting priorities are identified within the study: (re) establishment of the state monopoly on the legitimate use of forces and efforts to combat ordinary crime; a functioning separation of powers (<b>horizontal</b> <b>checks</b> and balances); respect for the rule of law, and legal empowerment of citizens; efforts to combat corruption and to eliminate criminal economies. Donors' ability to {{have a positive impact on}} fragile states remains limited, unless they pursue coherent policies on the national level and coordinate more effectively on the international level. The development of common country strategies, the clarification of responsibilities as well as harmonised analysis and decision-making mechanisms in the case of 'states at risk' are steps in the right direction...|$|R

This reversal of the sign of the slip direction at each boundary corresponds to the concept of “slip deficit” for seismic crustal deformation (e.g., Matsu’ura et al. 1986).|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{requirement for}} the integration of unmanned aircraft into civil airspace is the capability of aircraft to remain well clear {{of each other and}} avoid collisions. This requirement has led to a broad recognition of the need for an unambiguous, formal definition of well clear. It is further recognized that any such definition must be interoperable with existing airborne collision avoidance systems (ACAS). A particular class of well-clear definitions uses logic checks of independent distance thresholds as well as independent time thresholds in the vertical and horizontal dimensions to determine if a well-clear violation is predicted to occur within a given time interval. Existing ACAS systems also use independent distance thresholds, however a common time threshold is used for the vertical and <b>horizontal</b> logic <b>checks.</b> The main contribution of this paper is the characterization {{of the effects of the}} decoupled vertical time threshold on a well-clear definition in terms of (1) time to well-clear violation, and (2) interoperability with existing ACAS. The paper provides governing equations for both metrics and includes simulation results to illustrate the relationships. In this paper, interoperability implies that the time of well-clear violation is strictly less than the time a resolution advisory is issued by ACAS. The encounter geometries under consideration in this paper are initially well clear and consist of constant-velocity trajectories resulting in near-mid-air collisions...|$|R

For pressures at which the molecular mean free path is smaller than the wire diameter, the results appear to satisfy a relation of a form derived for free-molecule heat conduction.

The Interactive Graphics Intersection Design System (IGIDS) is a computer software program developed for TxDOT that assists engineers in the analysis and design of individual, at-grade intersections. IGIDS was initially developed under several RMC 3 – Geometric Design, Environmental, Hydraulics, and Right-of-Way projects.

30|$|Coming back {{to policy}} implications, notice that {{horizontal}} mergers are commonly proposed and usually accepted {{in case there}} is no substantial lessening of competition or the merger is a necessary condition to achieve efficiency gains. Since the isolated strategic effects do not allow to clear horizontal mergers, we resort to considering efficiency effects linked to <b>horizontal</b> mergers to <b>check</b> the conditions antitrust authorities should impose to clear them for the case of n= 2. To tackle this issue we consider a price index to evaluate unilateral effects of a merger which takes into account, on the one hand, the diversion ratio and the pre-merger margin index and, on the other, the pass-through rate. We find that both the diversion ratio and the pre-merger margin index are greater in a composite good industry, compared to a regular good industry. Thus, despite being counter intuitive, firms’ market power is greater in a four-firm composite good industry than in a standard duopoly of a regular good. The pass-through rate, however, is lower in a composite good industry. An important {{result is that the}} marginal cost saving required for a horizontal merger in order not to increase prices is greater in a composite good industry than in a regular good one. Antitrust authorities should request, therefore, higher savings levels in the case of horizontal mergers in composite good markets.|$|R

The test involved 96 female college students. The stimuli were made with the i-Designer com-puter program. The panels tested the computer screen images of all manikins wearing pants.

Three factors (lower-body compensation, abdomen highlight, and length compensation) influenced the visual effect pant styles and geometric patterns. The skinny style and large vertical stripe evaluated pos-itively in elongated height and leg length and a slimmer overall body. It was shown that the vertical stripe pattern was evaluated as more positive than the horizontal stripe pattern in the visual effect; particularly, the results showed distinct aspects in the classic pants style. The mutual influence of the visual effect (according to pants style and geometric pattern) were indicated as two factors of lower-body compensation and length compensation.

Many studies on driver speed behaviour are found in the scientific literature, and researchers have addressed roadway alignment consistency for travel safety in context with real operating speeds. This paper illustrates an experimental analysis conducted on the State Highway “Tirrenia Inferiore” in Southern Italy without spiral transition curves between geometric tangent and circular elements on the <b>horizontal</b> alignment, to <b>check</b> a new prediction consistency model. Two consistency measures were developed and compared with the results available in scientific literature: the first was the relative area bounded by the speed profile and the average weighted speed; the second was the standard deviation of operating speeds in each design element along the entire road investigated. Combining these two previous measures and following an extensive sensitivity analysis, a consistency model was developed and thresholds for good, acceptable and poor road consistency can be proposed. The consistency prediction model was related to numbers of crashes occurred from 2003 to 2010. It was found that as design consistency increased, number of crashes decrease significantly. Consistency model can be use for this purpose during the geometric design process or during the evaluation process for two-lane rural highways...|$|R

The CARDS project will produce high-quality upper-air data for the research community and for policy-makers. The authors intend to produce a dataset which is: easy to use, as complete as possible, as free of random errors as possible. They will also attempt to identify biases and remove them whenever possible. In this report, they relate progress toward their goal. They created a robust new format for archiving upper-air data, and designed a relational database structure to hold them. The authors have converted 13 datasets to the new format and have archived over 10, 000, 000 individual soundings from 10 separate data sources.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the political and}} security impacts of the devolution of power to Russiagass regions since 1993. By reviewing the basis of Russiagass federal structure the author identifies how {{the nature of the}} structure {{and the manner in which}} it evolved have led to the emergence of local tsars who have few <b>horizontal</b> or vertical <b>checks</b> on their power. The thesis analyzes the impact that strong regional leaders have had within their regions, to include their impact on free and fair elections, free press, individualsgas rights, and rule of law. The author finds that the lack of checks on the regional leadersgas abuses of power within the regions destabilizes the country by only further encouraging them to expand their power into realms intended to be under the control of the federal government, to include the military and foreign policy. The resultant injection of regional leadership into these matters threatens the security of Russia by inhibiting the ability of the central government to field a cohesive military force and pursue cogent foreign policy.

5000|$|Almost all blades are decorated, {{although}} not all blades are decorated on the visible part of the blade. Once the blade is cool, and the mud is scraped off, the blade has designs and grooves cut into it. One {{of the most important}} markings on the sword is performed here: the file markings. These are cut into the tang (nakago), or the hilt-section of the blade, during shaping, where they will be covered by a tsuka or hilt later. The tang is never supposed to be cleaned: doing this can cut the value of the sword in half or more. The purpose is to show how well the blade steel ages. A number of different types of file markings are used, including <b>horizontal,</b> slanted, and <b>checked,</b> known as ichi-monji, ko-sujikai, sujikai, ō-sujikai, katte-agari, shinogi-kiri-sujikai, taka-no-ha, and gyaku-taka-no-ha. A grid of marks, from raking the file diagonally both ways across the tang, is called higaki, whereas specialized [...] "full dress" [...] file marks are called kesho-yasuri. Lastly, if the blade is very old, it may have been shaved instead of filed. This is called sensuki. While ornamental, these file marks also serve the purpose of providing an uneven surface which bites well into the hilt which fits over it, and is made from wood. It is this pressure fit for the most part that holds the hilt in place, while the mekugi pin serves as a secondary method and a safety.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{undertake}} simplified design and assessment of cofferdam under vertical surcharge {{in the form of}} virtual project. Cofferdam constructed on the sea shore must be able to withstand all loads to enable construction of cut and cover tunnel. As a part of the design it is required to assess ground conditions and it is necessary to review feasibility of the structure on the sea. The construction will be described in construction phases and graphically demonstrated in construction sequence drawing. Because the structure is designed for life time of five years, temperature load on struts is studied in the thesis and further considered in structural analysis. Furthermore, it is required to compare analytical models from GEO 5 and PLAXIS. Horizontal frame is analysed separately in Scia Engineer. Structural members – cofferdam wall, waler beam and strut are checked in this thesis. For the design of the cofferdam wall second order theory is considered. All mentioned requirements were accomplished with help of corresponding Eurocodes, books and technical advice. Results of this work are feasible and it was possible to design all members to enable construction of the cut and cover tunnel. The phasing was designed such that deformation of the cofferdam is minimalized and use of machinery is limited to machines on temporary platforms. Comparison of two different analytical models showed that different soil modelling has great effect on internal forces, even though the shape of the bending curve is very similar, values obtained from PLAXIS software are much higher.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the theta angle {{as a solution to}} the U(1) A problem in the Lagrangian of QCD indicates a violation of Charge-Parity in strong interactions, which is not observed leading to the strong CP problem. From experimental results, the neutron electric dipole moment and thus the theta angle is orders of magnitude more strict that expected. A solution to this invokes a new global symmetry, the Peccei-Quinn symmetry. The spontaneous breaking of this symmetry at a speciﬁc energy scale predicts the existence of a light, neutral and weakly interacting Nambu-Goldstone boson, the axion. The characteristic of the axion, its mass and its coupling constant, are inversely proportional to the breaking fa of the energy scale. Axions are expected to be copiously produced in stellar cores, escape and carry away amounts of energy from the star. Therefore they constitute an energy dissipation mechanism which aﬀects their evolution and sets bounds in the axion mass and coupling. Axions might be created in reactions taking place inside the sun. The average energy of the expected axion solar ﬂux is calculated equal to 4. 2 keV. Depending on their density and mass, they may constitute a candidate for the cold dark matter in the universe. CERN Axion Solar telescope (CAST) is an astroparticle experiment at CERN running since 2003 and its main purpose is the search for axions. The detection technique is based on the Primakoﬀ eﬀect. Inside a strong electric and magnetic ﬁeld the coupling of two photons could lead to an axion production and vice versa the axion couples with a virtual photon producing a real detectable photon. The main component of CAST is a 10 -meter LHC prototype magnet, with a twin aperture that reaches a magnetic ﬁeld of 8. 8 T. The magnet is placed on a moving platform and can be moved up to± 8 ◦ vertically and± 40 ◦ horizontally. The magnet can track the sun 90 minutes during sunrise and sunset. The remaining hours are dedicated to background measurements. In the ﬁrst phase the experiment operated with vacuum inside the magnet bores, thus exploring the axion mass range up to 0. 02 eV. In order to extend CAST sensitivity to higher axion masses, the magnet bores were ﬁlled with a buﬀer gas, at ﬁrst with 4 He and then with 3 He. For the ﬁrst time, the limit entered the QCD axion model band and the KSVZ line was crossed. In the third phase of the experiment 4 He was used in order to revisit the results of phase two, with improved sensitivity and longer exposure time. During the fourth phase, CAST took data with vacuum in the magnet pipes using for the ﬁrst time sub-keV detectors. CAST has made a ﬁrst dedicated sub-keV search for solar chameleons based on the Primakoﬀ eﬀect. CAST has completed the search for solar axions. Searches are now focused on relic axions using the haloscope technique. Up to now haloscope searches have used solenoid magnets to provide the magnetic ﬁeld with cylindrical cavities. In the case of CAST, rectangular cavities will be inserted inside the dipole magnet. The conversion probability is signiﬁcantly enhanced if it occurs in a cavity resonant to the energy of the ALP. To cover a wide range of axion masses a tuning mechanism will be used for diﬀerent frequencies. In the ﬁrst chapter a brief introduction on axions and their properties is presented. A description of the various subsystems and the results of the experiment are included in chapter 2. Chapter 3 refers to the data acquisition system and the control systems in CAST. This chapter includes detailed description of the Slow Control, the Solar Tracking Software and the <b>Horizontal</b> laser <b>check</b> program. The properties of the Silicon Drift Detector, which was installed in the experiment in 2013 and it is currently used in the CAST laboratory, are presented in chapter 4.
