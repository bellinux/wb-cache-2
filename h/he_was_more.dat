5|$|After his divorce, Vainio's life slowly {{began to}} change. Creatively <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> {{prolific}} than ever in the late 1970s and 1980s. He began composing in addition to writing lyrics. He worked a lot with Veikko Samuli and Jaakko Salo, and Salo started arranging songs Vainio had written.|$|E
5|$|Bush portrayed {{himself as}} a {{compassionate}} conservative, implying <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> centrist than other Republicans. He campaigned on a platform that included bringing integrity and honor back to the White House, increasing {{the size of the}} United States Armed Forces, cutting taxes, improving education, and aiding minorities. By early 2000, the race had centered on Bush and McCain.|$|E
5|$|On {{other issues}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> liberal, such as {{supporting}} moves to abolish penal laws against dissenting Christians. He also opposed efforts to bar those {{found guilty of}} adultery from remarriage.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> passive when <b>he</b> defends. Rather than tackle a player, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> {{likely to}} shadow him, thus pushing him back. This mentality earns him both praise and criticism.|$|R

5|$|Against Walpole's wishes, but to George's delight, Britain reopened {{hostilities}} with Spain in 1739. Britain's {{conflict with}} Spain, the War of Jenkins' Ear, {{became part of}} the War of the Austrian Succession when a major European dispute broke out upon the death of Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI in 1740. At issue was the right of Charles's daughter, Maria Theresa, to succeed to his Austrian dominions. George spent the summers of 1740 and 1741 in Hanover, where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> able to intervene directly in European diplomatic affairs in his capacity as elector.|$|E
5|$|At {{a meeting}} of local Democrats in Bardstown, Kentucky, in 1859, Brown was {{nominated}} to oppose Joshua Jewett for Jewett's seat in the House of Representatives. Despite Brown's protests that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> than a year younger than the legal age to serve, he was elected over Jewett by about two thousand votes. He did not take his seat until the second congressional session because of his age. He {{became a member of}} the Douglas National Committee in 1860 and engaged in a series of debates with supporters of John C. Breckinridge for president, including Breckinridge's cousin, William Campbell Preston Breckinridge.|$|E

5|$|Born to Irish immigrants, Talbot was {{minimally}} educated, {{working in}} textile mills {{from an early}} age. He entered into a partnership with his brother, founding the Talbot Mills of Billerica in 1857. He became politically active, partly due to issues with the mills, and served two terms as Lieutenant Governor, acting as Governor {{for part of the}} second term after Governor William B. Washburn won election to the United States Senate. Talbot was a strong temperance advocate, and his veto of a popular alcohol licensing bill contributed to his loss in the 1874 gubernatorial race. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> successful in 1878 against divided opposition, serving a single lackluster term.|$|E
5|$|Broder Lysholm Knudtzon (5 October 178820 March 1864) was a Norwegian merchant, {{politician}} and benefactor. Born {{into one of}} Trondheim's wealthiest mercantile families, he travelled to England where he developed a great admiration of English language and literature. Despite his commercial background <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> drawn towards the fields of politics, culture and art. He nevertheless administrated his father's family firm, acting as foreign correspondent with {{little interest in the}} everyday business. In England he befriended Lord Byron and came {{under the influence of the}} English national liberal movement. Prior to his death, he bequeathed his entire library and several artworks to the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters.|$|E
5|$|Eardwulf's {{whereabouts}} {{after his}} recovery are not known. In surviving King Æthelred's anger <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> fortunate than Ælfwald's sons, who were drowned on Æthelred's orders in 791. Osred returned from exile but was betrayed, {{and killed by}} Æthelred's command on 14 September 792. Æthelred himself was assassinated on 18 April 796, perhaps at Corbridge, by conspirators led by the dux Ealdred. Æthelred was followed as king by Osbald, whose antecedents are unknown: he was deposed after twenty-seven days and fled {{to the land of}} the Picts with a few supporters.|$|E

5|$|He {{could be}} charming or vulgar, {{ebullient}} or sullen, {{he was given}} to public displays of rage (often contrived) and to soaring hyperbole in his rhetoric. But whatever he was, however he came across, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> human than his predecessor or even than most of his foreign counterparts, and {{for much of the}} world that was enough to make the USSR seem less mysterious or menacing.|$|E
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> {{directly}} involved in the activities of the commissioned raiders, ships of the Confederate States Navy that were sent out to destroy rather than capture enemy commerce. He first proposed their use as early as April 18, 1861. The first raider, , avoided the Union blockade at New Orleans on June 30, 1861. From then until after the war was over, the small group of raiders plundered Union shipping, inflicting damage on the American Merchant Marine that persists to the present day. They failed of their primary purpose, however, because Welles maintained the Union blockade, and international trade continued as before, carried in ships flying foreign flags.|$|E
5|$|In October 2015, The Boston Globe first {{reported}} that Wolf was considering {{not running for}} re-election. Weeks later in November, Wolf confirmed that he would remain in office, but would not seek re-election in 2016. Wolf's political aspirations were prodded shortly after handily winning re-election in 2014, though he said <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> focused on serving his constituents than considering future office. After rumors that Wolf would not seek re-election in 2016 in order {{to focus on a}} run for governor in 2018 began circulating, Senate President Stan Rosenberg suggested it was because Wolf wanted to focus more on running his airline company.|$|E

5|$|In {{both the}} Test and county matches during the 1948 tour, Johnston carried the {{heaviest}} workload, bowling nearly 200 overs {{more than any}} other squad member. He was the leading wicket-taker in all first-class matches with 102 wickets at 16.42, and the last Australian to take a century of wickets on a tour of England. His average was only slightly inferior to that of Lindwall, who took 86 wickets at 15.68. The roles Johnston fulfilled are borne out in his economy rate and strike rate. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> economical than Miller and Lindwall, who took wickets more frequently.|$|E
5|$|In his roles at the ICTY and ICTR he had {{to design}} prosecutorial {{strategies}} for both those ground-breaking tribunals, from scratch. In doing so, he sought to be scrupulously even-handed – a goal <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> easily able to achieve at ICTY than at ICTR. He built his strategy at both courts {{to a large degree}} on that pursued by the prosecutors at the Nuremberg Tribunal of 1945–46. He served as the chief prosecutor of the two tribunals until September 1996. Among his most notable legal achievements as chief prosecutor was securing the recognition of rape as a war crime under the Geneva Convention.|$|E
5|$|Junior Johnson, {{owner of}} one of the top NASCAR teams, {{approached}} Kulwicki {{at the beginning of the}} 1990 season to try to get him to replace Terry Labonte in the No. 11 Budweiser Ford. Kulwicki declined, stating that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> interested in running his own team. He won his second Cup race at Rockingham on October 21, 1990, and finished eighth in points that year, his first finish in the top10 points in a season. In 29races, he had thirteen top10 finishes and onepole position.|$|E

30|$|B: But {{we have to}} {{know this}} that some people only to give just like you said in teamwork. Some people they give because they want to make you feel like <b>he</b> <b>is</b> cleverer than you, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> {{stronger}} than you, and <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> powerful than you. So he choose to give not because he wants to make this thing better, just want to show that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> powerful than you. That’s a kind of abnormal kind of giving.|$|R
5|$|Miguel {{confirmed}} {{that it was}} the first album where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> involved in the tracks' composition. In addition to Miguel co-writing several of the record's tracks, he was assisted by other composers including Armando Manzanero, Juan Carlos Calderón, and Arturo Perez. Recording took place at the A Studios, Cello Studios, Ocean Way Recording, Watersound, and the Record Plant in Hollywood, California with Miguel handling the production himself.|$|E
5|$|Minton did {{not enjoy}} the limited {{influence}} of his judicial role in the later years of his term, when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> frequently in the minority in voting on cases. After the deaths of Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson and Justice Robert Jackson, Minton found himself with little support for many of his opinions, which led him to begin considering retirement.|$|E
5|$|Returning to {{play for}} Northamptonshire, he was less effective. Hampered by a knee injury, which necessitated surgery after the English season, and {{suffering}} from many dropped catches, he took 50 first-class wickets {{at an average of}} 26.14, but his performance compared unfavourably with other bowlers on the team. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>more</b> effective in the NatWest Trophy, a one-day competition that Northamptonshire won that season, in which he conceded fewer than two runs per over across five games.|$|E
