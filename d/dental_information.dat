The evaluation of dental clinic services was done internally and externally.

The results of this study showed that <b>dental</b> clinic <b>information</b> system at the Health Polytechnic before system development was not accessible, timely, accurate, and relevant. The results of quantitative analysis revealed that organization resources, structure, roles and functions, and route of information could support information system development.

40|$|Background: Mutations in the APC gene cause {{familial}} adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an {{autosomal dominant}} colorectal cancer predisposition associated {{with the development of}} hundreds to thousands of adenomatous colorectal polyps beginning in childhood or adolescence. Both malignant and non-malignant extracolonic manifestations are associated with APC gene mutations, including approximately 17 % of individuals with various dental anomalies. The availability of <b>dental</b> anomaly <b>information</b> in the medical record remains to be evaluated. Methods: Medical records were reviewed for documentation of dental anomalies. Dental questionnaires were mailed to 271 individuals with FAP at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC) to assess self-reported dental phenotype. Demographic data was obtained from chart review and included current age or age at death, age at diagnosis of FAP, sex, surgical procedure for polyposis, available <b>dental</b> phenotype <b>information,</b> date of last contact at UTMDACC, and APC gene mutation and codon. Results: The response rate to the dental questionnaire was 21 %. The majority of individuals (82 %) were did not have <b>dental</b> anomaly <b>information</b> available in the medical record. Forty-four (16 %) had self-reported dental anomalies in either the medical record or on the dental questionnaire. The most frequently reported anomalies were dental crowding and supernumerary teeth. Conclusion: Our findings are consistent with previous reports of the prevalence of dental anomalies in individuals with FAP. The results {{of this study indicate that}} dental anomalies in individuals with FAP are not consistently recorded in the medical record. Ultimately, consistent documentation of these anomalies in the medical record can aid in detection of FAP in individuals for whom genetic testing is not available.

RESULTS: Only 36. 6 % (209 / 571) {{of the respondents were}} able to correctly identify the appropriate place for treatment of dental injury. 55. 2 % of the respondents knew the suitable time for treatment. Only 24. 7 % of the respondents possessed the knowledge of how to correctly manage fractured teeth. Only 23. 6 % of them knew how to manage displaced teeth. 62. 5 % of them correctly answered that knocked-out deciduous teeth should not be replanted to the original position, but few of them (23. 6 %) knew that permanent teeth should be replanted.
