25|$|Domestic <b>{{knitting}}</b> <b>machines</b> use the {{weft knitting}} method which produces a fabric similar to hand knitting. Knitting proceeds {{more quickly than}} in hand knitting, where (usually two) straight needles are held in the hand and each stitch is manipulated individually across the row. <b>Knitting</b> <b>machines</b> work an entire row of loops in a single movement.|$|E
25|$|Industrially, {{metal wire}} is also knitted into a metal fabric {{for a wide}} range of uses {{including}} the filter material in cafetieres, catalytic converters for cars and many other uses. These fabrics are usually manufactured on circular <b>knitting</b> <b>machines</b> that would be recognized by conventional knitters as sock machines.|$|E
25|$|There are {{numerous}} types of <b>knitting</b> <b>machines,</b> ranging from simple spool or board templates with no moving parts to highly complex mechanisms controlled by electronics. All, however, produce {{various types of}} knitted fabrics, usually either flat or tubular, and of varying degrees of complexity. Pattern stitches can be selected by hand manipulation of the needles, or with push-buttons and dials, mechanical punch cards, or electronic pattern reading devices and computers.|$|E

2500|$|The fabric {{produced}} using a <b>knitting</b> <b>machine</b> is of a {{more even}} texture than hand-knitted fabric, which is particularly noticeable on large areas of plain stockinette stitch, and can be an advantage. [...] Some stitch patterns (e.g., tuck stitches) are much easier to produce with a <b>knitting</b> <b>machine.</b> [...] Others (e.g. garter stitch) can also be produced with <b>machine</b> <b>knitting</b> but can take a little longer but still much faster than hand knitting. [...] The standard gauge 200-needle <b>machine</b> can <b>knit</b> the finest yarns up to a good sport-weight, while the heavier yarns knit better on a mid-gauge or bulky <b>knitting</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|R
25|$|Robert Hyde Greg and John Greg, sons of Samuel Greg of Quarry Bank Mill, {{who owned}} {{about a third}} of Reddish by 1857, opened Albert Mills for cotton {{spinning}} in 1845. Moor Mill, manufacturing <b>knitting</b> <b>machines,</b> was built around the same time. William Houldsworth's Reddish Mill for cotton spinning was opened in 1864. Hanover Mill was built in 1865 for cotton spinning, but in 1889 was converted to make silk, velvet, woven fur etc.|$|E
25|$|Nolde {{arrived on}} a {{steamship}} in 1880 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He {{was drawn to}} the German speaking communities of southeastern Pennsylvania and quickly found employment as a weaver for the Louis Kraemer Woolen Mills near Reading. Nolde soon rose {{to the top of the}} corporate ladder at Kraemer Mills, from there he was able to acquire much of the machinery that Kraemer Mills had used in their hosiery business. Nolde established his own hosiery factory in Reading in 1888, just eight years after leaving Germany. Nolde took on some partners, Jacob Lorah and George Horst, and was able to expand his hosiery business. His operation, Nolde and Horst Company, employed 500 workers who operated about 400 <b>knitting</b> <b>machines</b> in 1897.|$|E

2500|$|In {{very simple}} cases, {{knitting}} {{can be done}} without tools, using only the fingers to do these tasks; however, knitting is usually carried out using tools such as knitting needles, <b>knitting</b> <b>machines</b> or rigid frames. [...] Depending on their size and shape, the rigid frames are called stocking frames, knitting boards, knitting rings (also called knitting looms) or knitting spools (also known as knitting knobbies, knitting nancies, or corkers). [...] There is also a technique called knooking of knitting with a crochet hook that has a cord attached to the end, to hold the stitches while they're being worked. Other tools are used to prepare yarn for knitting, to measure and design knitted garments, or to make knitting easier or more comfortable.|$|E
2500|$|House left Wheeler and Wilson in 1869 {{and turned}} his {{attention}} to developing a machine that could knit various-sized goods, both flat and tubular. At the time, there were no machines on the market doing that type of work. In 1870, the Armstrong and House Manufacturing Company was organized and a shop was built to produce the new <b>knitting</b> <b>machines.</b> [...] Five patents were issued to House from 1869 to 1872, among them was one for a new system of knitting stockings in a continuous tube. The process would first knit the leg, then form a mitered heal, then the foot and mitered toe then a leg, and so on. The toe was then separated from the leg by drawing a thread leaving all the loops ready to close.|$|E
2500|$|If {{they are}} not secured, the loops of a knitted course will come undone when their yarn is pulled; {{this is known as}} ripping out, {{unravelling}} knitting, or humorously, frogging (because you 'rip it', this sounds like a frog croaking: 'rib-bit'). To secure a stitch, at least one new loop is passed through it. Although the new stitch is itself unsecured ("active" [...] or [...] "live"), it secures the stitch(es) suspended from it. A sequence of stitches in which each stitch is suspended from the next is called a wale. To secure the initial stitches of a knitted fabric, a method for casting on is used; to secure the final stitches in a wale, one uses a method of binding/casting off. During knitting, the active stitches are secured mechanically, either from individual hooks (in <b>knitting</b> <b>machines)</b> or from a knitting needle or frame in hand-knitting.|$|E

In the workroom on this Saturday afternoon a number of the young women were engaged in mending their own garments. After their period of probation many of these girls are sent out to situations found for them by the Army.|$|E
