5|$|Tunney {{announced}} that a coin toss {{would be used to}} decide who faced Yokozuna for the belt first. If Luger won, he would face Yokozuna first. Hart would then wrestle his brother Owen Hart before facing the winner of the Luger-Yokozuna match. If Hart won the coin toss, he would <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> title shot, and Luger would wrestle Crush earlier on the card. On the January 31, 1994 episode of Monday Night Raw, Luger won the coin toss and the right to face Yokozuna first.|$|E
5|$|Passport to Pimlico is set {{during a}} {{heatwave}} {{that occurred in}} Britain in 1947, but, despite this, filming took place during 1948's abnormally wet summer. The poor weather caused delays in production, {{which led to the}} film being over-time and over-budget. Shooting started early each day, in an attempt to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> successful shot completed before 9:00 am. An average of ten takes a day were taken, in an attempt to get two and a half minutes of usable film per day. There were arguments between Cornelius and Balcon throughout the production, because Balcon was unhappy with what he saw as poor direction. Cornelius left Ealing Studios after working on Passport to Pimlico and did not work for the studio again.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{learns that}} his father took all the family money and fled to Argentina with his mistress. Left {{to pick up the}} pieces, Andy sells off family heirlooms, and is upset that he has to sell the family boat for lack of any other means for his mother to support herself. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) convinces him that before he sells the boat, they should take it out for one last sunset cruise, and they drive to Stamford, Connecticut, where the boat is docked. Andy starts to hoist the main sail, but is stopped by a broker who is to sail it to the Caribbean for the buyer. With Erin's encouragement, Andy decides to take the boat to the Caribbean himself. He then finds his drunken brother Walter (Josh Groban) passed out in the liquor closet. Walter comes to and tells Andy he wanted to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> relapse out of the way before {{checking}} into rehab. Andy invites him on the trip, saying they both need family time together and leaves, thanking Erin for her encouragement. Erin says to the camera that she would have loved to go with him if he asked. Back in the office that evening, Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) asks Erin to join him for drinks, and she accepts.|$|E

5|$|The next {{match was}} a Falls Count Anywhere match between Randy Savage and Crush. The rules stated that any time a wrestler was pinned, he {{then had to}} make it back inside the ring within sixty seconds or he would lose the match. Savage tried to attack Crush before the bell rang, but Crush {{reversed}} the attack. He used a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker to injure Savage and then dropped Savage across the guard rail to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> pinfall. While Savage was returning to the ring, Mr. Fuji hit him with the Japanese flag to stall him. Savage made it back to the ring with two seconds remaining, so the match continued. Inside the ring, Crush tried to throw salt in Savage's eyes, but Savage countered by throwing the salt in Crush's eyes. Savage then performed a diving elbow drop and rolled Crush outside of the ring for the pinfall. Fuji helped revive Crush, which allowed Crush to return to the ring before the count had expired. Savage and Crush then brawled down the aisle and into a room backstage. Savage scored a pinfall and tied Crush's legs to a pulley. Crush was left hanging upside down and could not return to the ring, so Savage was declared the winner.|$|E
25|$|The New York Knicks {{were the}} first winner of the lottery in 1985. They {{selected}} Georgetown University standout Patrick Ewing with their first overall pick. However, speculation arose that the NBA had rigged the lottery so that the Knicks would be assured to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> pick. Even though the envelope system was highly criticized, it was used until 1989 before being replaced by the weighted lottery system in 1990.|$|E

25|$|The {{separate}} condenser showed dramatic {{potential for}} improvements on the Newcomen engine but Watt was still discouraged by seemingly insurmountable problems before a marketable engine could be perfected. It {{was only after}} entering into partnership with Matthew Boulton that such became reality. Watt told Boulton about his ideas on improving the engine, and Boulton, an avid entrepreneur, agreed to fund development of a test engine at Soho, near Birmingham. At last Watt had access to facilities and the practical experience of craftsmen who were soon able to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> engine working. As fully developed, it used about 75% less fuel than a similar Newcomen one.|$|E

25|$|The {{journalist}} and BBC Radio 4 presenter John Humphrys has long stated that his career ambition is to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> full {{interview with the}} Queen. In 2006, the Queen came close to an orthodox interview when she agreed to be portrait-painted by the later-disgraced Australian artist and personality Rolf Harris, who engaged in small talk with her, on film, and with palace permission. It was shown on the BBC, CBC, and ABC. Their conversation ventured little beyond previous portraits of the Queen and royal art history in general, and the Queen's responses to Harris's conversational overtures were notably crisp and monosyllabic. The 1992 BBC documentary on the Queen, , directed by Edward Mirzoeff on the fortieth anniversary of her accession, attracted record audiences for a factual programme.|$|E
25|$|After the 1984 coin flip, {{which was}} {{won by the}} Houston Rockets, the NBA {{introduced}} the lottery system to counter the accusations that the Rockets and several other teams were deliberately losing their regular season games {{in order to secure}} the worst record and consequently the chance to obtain the first pick. The lottery system involved a random drawing of an envelope from a hopper. Inside each of the envelopes was the name of a non-playoff team. The team whose envelope was drawn first would <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> pick. The process was then repeated until the rest of the lottery picks were determined. In this system, each non-playoff team had an equal chance to obtain the first pick. The rest of the first-round picks were determined in reverse order of the win-loss record.|$|E

As there was no click, it is likely that Captain Tsu pulled out the CVR circuit breaker before leaving the cockpit. The NTSC and NTSB investigators thought that if Captain Tsu was responsible for the crash, he must have made up some excuse to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> Officer to leave the flightdeck prior to disabling the FDR (which would have immediately triggered a Master Caution on both pilots' control panels), so his actions would not be noticed.

25|$|To {{fill the}} Canucks' roster for their inaugural season, the league held an Expansion Draft in the {{preceding}} summer. A draft lottery was held on June 9, 1970, determining who between the Canucks and Sabres would <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> selection in the Expansion Draft, {{as well as the}} 1970 NHL Amateur Draft; the Sabres won both spins. With his first selection in the Expansion Draft, Canucks General Manager Bud Poile chose defenceman Gary Doak. Among the other players chosen by Vancouver were centre Orland Kurtenbach, who was named the Canucks' first captain, as well as defenceman Pat Quinn, who later became the team's general manager and coach in the 1990s. Two days later, on June 11, 1970, the Canucks made defenceman Dale Tallon their first-ever Amateur Draft selection. Tallon played three seasons with the club before being traded away to the Chicago Black Hawks. By comparison, the Sabres chose centre Gilbert Perreault with the first overall selection they won from the lottery; Perreault {{went on to become a}} nine-time All-Star and member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.|$|E

The two new teams took part in a roulette wheel spin to determine who would <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> pick. Ultimately, the Canucks were allocated numbers 1-10 on the wheel, while the Sabres had 11-20. When league president Clarence Campbell spun the wheel, he initially thought the pointer landed on 1 and started to congratulate the Vancouver delegation. [...] However, Sabres coach/general manager Punch Imlach asked Campbell to check again. As it turned out, the pointer was on 11. [...] Imlach had chosen 11 for the roulette wheel spin because it was his favourite number. This was the first year the Montreal Canadiens did not have a priority right to draft Québécois junior players. Consequently, Perreault was available and taken first overall by the Sabres.|$|E

Instead, devotees go to the nearby Brahmagiri to see the Lord in the four-handed form of Alarnath, a depiction of Vishnu. Devotees then <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> glimpse of the Lord only on the day before Rath Yatra, which is called Navayouvana. It is a local belief that the gods suffer from fever after taking an elaborate ritual bath, and they are treated by the special servants, the Daitapatis, for 15 days. Daitapatis perform special nitis (rites) known as Netrotchhaba (a rite of painting the eyes of the triad). During this period cooked food is not offered to the deities.|$|E
