25|$|Central Bedfordshire Council (then Bedfordshire County Council) {{acquired}} the old church in 1977. The site continued {{to suffer from}} vandalism, as well as <b>fly-tipping,</b> under Council ownership. In 2010, local activism led to plans {{for the church to}} acquire a new function. It was proposed to convert it into a bothy to provide overnight accommodation for walkers on the Bedfordshire Greensand Ridge walk, with a full-time warden on site. However, there were concerns that the Council {{would not be able to}} afford the £75,000 that it would have to spend on such a project.|$|E

The Midland Metro has two stops nearby - Winson Green Outer Circle and Handsworth Booth Street. Kitchener Street which, until they were demolished in 1980, ran between terraced houses, was gated in January 2009 under section 129A of the Highways act 1980 - a measure intended by Sandwell MBC to prevent extensive <b>fly-tipping.</b>|$|E
25|$|A token {{remnant of}} Snape Wood {{was left behind}} {{in the middle of the}} new estate, amounting to little more than a small fenced-in copse with three {{pathways}} leading through it. Owned by the local authority, Nottingham City Council, the site was designated a Local Nature Reserve, but years of neglect have left the site rubbish-strewn and in need of a structured management plan. Despite constant <b>fly-tipping</b> and a lack of proactive conservation, this site surprisingly supports a wide variety of wildlife, from rare wildflowers to mammals such as grey squirrels, hedgehogs and urban foxes, as well as up to 20 different species of bird. In February 2009, plans to set up a community group to take ownership for the maintenance and conservation of the site on behalf of the local authority were moved forward.|$|E
25|$|There {{were also}} {{physical}} {{problems with the}} estate. Whilst the design and layout had exacerbated {{some of the problems}} such as crime, there were also issues with the quality of construction of the buildings. The design of the estate was based around three main roads - Farnborough Road, Tangmere Drive and Yatesbury Avenue - which were wide and straight, lending themselves to joyriders. Many pockets of the estate were hidden from view allowing muggings to take place, as well as drug dealing and drug taking. They became litter traps and <b>fly-tipping</b> could occur with ease. The design of individual buildings was also of concern, {{with a wide range of}} issues such as the ease of access for arsonists to the rubbish chutes of the maisonettes, which posed a safety hazard to residents. Issues regarding the construction of the buildings were noticed early into the estate's life. In the early 1970s, many homes were starting to experience damp and others were flooded as a result of leaking roofs. In the maisonettes, heating bills were between £300-500 quarterly and the homes remained cold in the winter. These issues regarding the construction were not confined to just the estate, but most other estates constructed in the Bison construction system. Birmingham City Council was eventually depleted of funds for the maintenance of the blocks and lift breakdowns became common, and were further aggravated by repairers refusing to work without security enforcement. They were also reports of teenage troublemakers setting fire to the staircases in the tower blocks. In 1991, a large concrete panel fell from one of the tower blocks and, although nobody was injured, it was reported locally and helped spark efforts for the regeneration of the estate to begin.|$|E

50|$|As {{the cost}} of {{disposing}} of household rubbish and waste increases, so does {{the number of individuals}} and businesses that fly-tip, and the UK government has made it easier for members of the public to report <b>fly-tipping.</b> The fine or punishment is normally defined by the local council that operates in the local area in which the rubbish was dumped. According to the BBC, <b>fly-tipping</b> costs councils in England and Wales more than £50m annually (2016).|$|E

50|$|The Elveden Estate {{continues}} {{to be one of}} the country's largest farms.

5000|$|Fly tipping. Fly tipping has {{increased}} over recent years within the Forest {{and there is}} some suggestion that this could be linked to the decreased provision of municipal refuse sites within local areas. During the year 2013/2014 there were 666 recorded incidents of <b>fly-tipping,</b> which cost £212,213.58; to put that into context, Epping Forest was 'overspent' on its £4.255m budget by £398,000.|$|E
50|$|Pond Road is {{so named}} for a pond that existed up until the 1970s when it was drained and {{subsequently}} attracted <b>fly-tipping.</b> Local residents remembered it had previously contained {{a wide variety of}} insect life, amphibians and fish, and attracted kingfishers. With the aid of local and county council grants it was re-established in 2003 and is now known as Fuller's Vale Wildlife Pond.|$|E
50|$|The {{consultation}} {{findings showed}} there was majority support {{within the community}} for introducing quantity-based MSW charging as a policy tool to facilitate waste recovery and reduction, yet the implementation details such as concerns about environmental hygiene issues and <b>fly-tipping</b> had diverse views. In {{the light of the}} findings, the government decided that a quantity-based MSW charging system should be the broad direction in pursuing domestic waste reduction.|$|E
50|$|In March 2014, The Guardian {{reported}} on how food hygiene inspectors {{found a small}} windowless bedroom behind the busy kitchen of a Sam's branch in east London, and that combined with imported chicken pieces enabled chicken shops to offer low prices to keep poor consumers happy, even if local councils were not. In November 2013, Sam's Chicken were fined £1750 by Ealing Council for <b>fly-tipping</b> of 35 rubbish sacks over seven nights, the shop owner had previously been fined in 2011.|$|E
50|$|The quarry {{is known}} for its {{geological}} exposures, and was originally about a mile long extending into Kiln Wood, which is to the north of this reserve. The southernmost part of the quarry was used as a public landfill site and destroyed and the northernmost part became under threat from <b>fly-tipping.</b> The Nature Conservancy Council designated the site an SSSI and unertook rehabilitation work. The Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust purchased the site in 1981. The Forest of Dean District Council provided grant aid.|$|E
5000|$|The {{scheme was}} {{established}} in 1999 on a fly-tipped, vandalised site at 39b Consort Road. The building {{had in the past}} been a doss-house or [...] "spike", a [...] "shelter of last resort" [...] serving the unemployed, homeless, and urban poor for over a century. At the time of its reoccupation, the building had been derelict for a decade and its exterior grounds used for <b>fly-tipping.</b> On arrival, the members of the scheme immediately cleared them using a JCB digger.|$|E

5000|$|Charging {{for waste}} can also {{sometimes}} result in illegal dumping (<b>fly-tipping)</b> or the waste being passed to unlicensed or illegal disposal methods. [...] In practice, increased litter, open burning, and illegal dumping {{have not been}} observed by most pay-as-you-throw communities, especially when combined with easier recycling and composting. [...] Municipalities in Massachusetts have typically observed a reduction in trash larger than the increase in recycling, but this {{is believed to be}} due to people formerly bringing in trash from other communities (where presumably there is no free pickup) to the homes of friends and relatives.|$|E

5000|$|The law {{protecting}} SSSIs now covers everyone, {{not just}} public bodies {{and the owners}} and occupiers of SSSIs. Previously, activities by [...] "third parties" [...] were not illegal under the SSSI legislation. This meant that damaging activities such as <b>fly-tipping,</b> intensive bait-digging or trail biking on an SSSI were only prevented if done (or permitted) by the owner or occupier - not if done by trespassers or under public rights. The effect was, for example to allow control of legal trail biking on SSSIs (where damaging to the interest), but not illegal trail biking. This loophole was closed by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 and section 19 of the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004.|$|E
50|$|Forensic {{geophysics}} {{is increasingly}} {{being used to}} detect near-surface objects/materials related to either a criminal or civil investigation. The most high-profile objects in criminal investigations is the search for clandestine burials of murder victims, {{but it can also}} include locating unmarked burials in graveyards and cemeteries, a weapon used in a crime, or indeed buried drugs or money stashes. Civil investigations are more usually looking to determine the location, amount and (more tricky) the timing of illegally dumped waste, which include physical (e.g. <b>fly-tipping)</b> and liquid contaminants (e.g. hydrocarbons). There are many geophysical methods that could be employed, depending upon the target and background host materials. Most commonly Ground Penetrating Radar is used but this may not always be an optimal search detection technique.|$|E
50|$|The Blue Lagoon is a Local Nature Reserve which attracts many {{visitors}} every day. Schoolchildren in Bletchley are often taken on trips {{to learn about}} the history of this site. It was formed in the winter of 1946 when the site, a former clay pit of the London Brick Company, filled up when the Water Eaton brook broke its banks. It is now used to train divers from the Milton Keynes Sub-Aqua club, who have planted two cars, a bus and a light aircraft in its depths to be explored. Because of the obligation to accept waste from London, the adjacent landfill site has increased in size up to the fence {{on the west side of}} the lagoon. The reserve is also prone to <b>fly-tipping</b> and vandalism.|$|E
