40|$|First of all, I {{would like}} to thank my thesis adviser Harry Atwater for his great mentorship and {{guidance}} over the years. While he is an extremely busy professor holding about twenty students in his research group and a lot of domestic and international travels for seminars and conferences, he never hesitated to discuss with me when I knocked on <b>his</b> <b>office’s</b> <b>door.</b> Our discussion often went over 1 hour in his tight schedule, but he did not stop until we reached clear conclusions and decided what to do next.

60|$|Feeling {{slightly}} uneasy {{as well as}} astonished, {{he stood}} still for, perhaps, a minute, gazing about him.

Crossing the room he looked into the safe.|$|R
