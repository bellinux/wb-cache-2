40|$|The {{conventional}} {{method of}} grading Harumanis mango is time-consuming, costly and affected by human bias. In this research, an in-line system {{was developed to}} classify Harumanis mango using computer vision. The system was {{able to identify the}} irregularity of mango shape and its estimated mass. A group of images of mangoes of different size and shape was used as database set. Some important features such as length, height, centroid and parameter were extracted from each image. Fourier descriptor and size-shape parameters were used to describe the mango shape while the disk method was used to estimate the mass of the mango. Four features have been selected by stepwise discriminant analysis which was effective in sorting regular and misshapen mango. The volume from water displacement method was compared with the volume estimated by image processing using paired t-test and Bland-Altman method. The result between both measurements was not significantly different (P > 0. 05). The average correct classification for shape classification was 98 % for a training set composed of 180 mangoes. The data was validated with another testing set consist of 140 mangoes which have the success rate of 92 %. The same set was used for evaluating the performance of mass estimation. The average success rate of the classification for grading based on its mass was 94 %. The results indicate that the <b>in-line</b> <b>sorting</b> system using machine vision has a great potential in automatic fruit sorting according to its shape and mass...|$|E
40|$|Perfect {{quality control}} of food {{becomes more and}} more a matter of course. Foreign materialslike pieces of rocks, insects, plastics, carton etc. have to be {{identified}} and sorted out. For many years, near-infrared spectroscopy has been a widely-used analytical offline method for quality inspection for small samples in the food and agriculture industry. Up to now, high-speed automatic sorting machines work usually on the basis of visual inspection, not near-infrared inspection. This article describes how an <b>in-line</b> food <b>sorting</b> system can be developed on the basis of hyperspectral imaging data. We focus on analyzing the vast amount of data to yield minimum band selection with optimal classification results required for an industrial sorter...|$|R
