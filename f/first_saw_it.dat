25|$|The {{city now}} known as Mexico City was founded as Tenochtitlan by the Aztecs in 1325 and a century later became the {{dominant}} city-state of the Aztec Triple Alliance, formed in 1430 and composed of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan. At its height, Tenochtitlan had enormous temples and palaces, a huge ceremonial center, residences of political, religious, military, and merchants. Its population was estimated at least 100,000 and perhaps as high as 200,000 in 1519 when the Spaniards <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|On {{the island}} of Manhattan {{as it was when}} Europeans <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> the Great Kill formed from three small streams that united near present-day Tenth Avenue and 40th Street, and then wound through the low-lying Reed Valley, renowned for fish and waterfowl, to empty into the Hudson River at a deep bay on the river at the present 42nd Street. The name was {{retained}} in a tiny hamlet called Great Kill, which became a center for carriage-making, while the upland to the south and east became known as Longacre, the predecessor of Longacre Square (now Times Square).|$|E
25|$|In 1875, Longo {{obtained}} {{as a gift}} {{a painting}} portraying Our Lady of the Rosary, with Saint Dominic and Saint Catherine of Siena. Sister M. Concetta de Litala of the Monastery of the Rosary at Porta Medina had been holding it for the Dominican priest Alberto Radente. Radente had acquired it from a junk-shop dealer in Naples for a very small sum. The painting was in bad condition and Longo wrote of his immediate distaste of the poor artistic quality when he <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it.</b> However, he accepted the gift to conserve funds and to not insult the Sister Concetta. Longo raised funds to restore the image {{and placed it in}} the church in an effort to encourage pilgrimages.|$|E

25|$|During {{his time}} at Glemham, Crabbe {{composed}} several novels, none of which were published. After Glemham, Crabbe moved {{to the village of}} Rendham in Suffolk, where he stayed until 1805. His poem The Parish Register was all but completed while at Rendham, and The Borough was also begun. 1805 was the last year of Crabbe's stay in Suffolk, and it was made memorable in literature by the appearance of the Lay of the Last Minstrel by Walter Scott. Crabbe <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> in a bookseller's shop in Ipswich, read it nearly through while standing at the counter, and pronounced that a new and great poet had appeared. In October 1805, Crabbe returned {{with his wife and two}} sons to the parsonage at Muston. He had been absent for nearly 13 years, of which four had been spent at Parham, five at Great Glemham, and four at Rendham.|$|E
25|$|Rusk first climbed Mount Stuart in 1920. When he <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> in 1894, Rusk {{desired to}} climb it; however, other matters, {{including}} the McKinley expedition, {{prevented him from}} climbing it. That same year, 1920, the Cascadians mountaineering club was formed and with Rusk as a leading member, they decided that a record box {{should be taken to}} the summit. Rusk climbed Stuart with Rolfe Morse Whitnall in July and although Whitnall was unable to make the summit, Rusk was successful and placed the record box on the summit. Their success inspired the club to send another party later that year on Labor Day. This party consisted of Clarence Truitt, Harold Carey, Vern Mason, Joseph R. Vincent, Rolland Whitmore, Wayne E. and Fern Richardson, Rolfe and Alice Whitnall, and Rusk. The whole party made the summit, even though they had some close calls and were forced to bivouac part of the way down the mountain. Rusk climbed Stuart again the next year with Wayne Richardson, Truitt, Rolfe Whitnall, Max Hiscock, and Jimmie Frisque. That year, they climbed earlier in the season, the 29th of May, than any party before and many thought that there was still too much snow to climb at that time in the season. All but Whitnall made the summit. Rusk led another much larger party up Stuart on May 29, 1922.|$|E

500|$|In April, Judge Wickersham {{arrived on}} a trip looking for a {{location}} for the courthouse, jail, and government offices for the Third District courts. He later described his first view of the settlement: [...] "A half-dozen new squat log structures, a few tents ... a small clearing in the primitive forest—that was Fairbanks as I <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> on April 9, 1903." [...] Wickersham examined Chena as a potential site for the government offices, but he settled on Fairbanks, partially because Barnette's partner and brother-in-law, Frank Cleary, gave Wickersham a choice piece of land valued at between $1,500 and $2,000. Wickersham asked Cleary to name the two main streets in town Cushman and Lacey, after U.S. Representatives Francis W. Cushman of Washington and John F. Lacey of Iowa.|$|E

Although {{he is often}} {{credited}} with shooting the drum-dance sequence, Ramnoth left the studio in August 1947 (before the scene was conceived). Director Singeetham Srinivasa Rao told film critic Baradwaj Rangan that he disliked Chandralekha when he <b>first</b> <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> and recognised it as a classic only after 25 years, [...] "a fact that the audiences realised in just two minutes."

[...] Warner Bros. executives, however, were worried that the content would be [...] "too weird" [...] or [...] "too artsy" [...] {{for the general public}} and favored a more traditional premise in contrast to the experimental approach Sednaoui took. The video was ultimately released without being edited by the record label; since then it has been widely credited as being a considerable factor in the Red Hot Chili Peppers' success and greatly increased their international popularity. Journalist Jeff Apter noted the video's [...] "funky brew of goofy looks, a subtle invasive hook, Flea's spindly fingered baseline and Kiedis' crotch-hugging shorts made the clip essential viewing across MTV throughout the last few months of 1991."
