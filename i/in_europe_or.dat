5|$|The {{development}} of women's football in Africa faces several challenges, including {{limited access to}} education, poverty amongst women, inequalities and human rights abuses targeting women. Funding is another issue impacting the game in Africa, where most financial assistance comes from FIFA and not national football associations. Another challenge is the retention of football players. Many women footballers leave the continent to seek greater opportunity <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>or</b> the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{taking of}} black swans to Europe in the 18th and early 19th centuries brought the birds {{into contact with}} another aspect of European mythology: the {{attribution}} of sinister relationships between the devil and black-coloured animals, such as a black cat. Black swans {{were considered to be}} a witch's familiar and often chased away or killed by superstitious folk. This may explain why black swans have never established a sizeable presence as feral animals <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>or</b> North America.|$|E
5|$|A {{geothermal}} heat pump can extract enough heat from shallow ground {{anywhere in the}} world to provide home heating, but industrial applications need the higher temperatures of deep resources. The thermal efficiency and profitability of electricity generation is particularly sensitive to temperature. The most demanding applications receive the greatest benefit from a high natural heat flux, ideally from using a hot spring. The next best option is to drill a well into a hot aquifer. If no adequate aquifer is available, an artificial one may be built by injecting water to hydraulically fracture the bedrock. This last approach is called hot dry rock geothermal energy <b>in</b> <b>Europe,</b> <b>or</b> enhanced geothermal systems in North America. Much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers.|$|E

5|$|Blackcurrants {{were once}} {{popular in the}} United States as well, but became less common in the 20th century after currant farming was banned in the early 1900s, when blackcurrants, as a vector of white pine blister rust, were {{considered}} {{a threat to the}} U.S. logging industry. The federal ban on growing currants was shifted to jurisdiction of individual states in 1966, and was lifted in New York State in 2003 through the efforts of horticulturist Greg Quinn. As a result, currant growing is making a comeback in New York, Vermont, Connecticut and Oregon. However, several statewide bans still exist including Maine, New Hampshire, Virginia, Ohio, and Massachusetts. Since the American federal ban curtailed currant production nationally for nearly a century, the fruit remains largely unknown in the United States, and has yet to regain its previous popularity to levels enjoyed <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>or</b> New Zealand. Owing to its unique flavour and richness in polyphenols, dietary fibre and essential nutrients, awareness and popularity of blackcurrant is once again growing, with a number of consumer products entering the U.S. market.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century, prosperous patrician {{families}} of merchants, bankers, or industrial investors, many of German origin, still conducted large-scale business operations <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>or</b> lent money to Polish noble interests, including the royal court. Some regions were highly urbanized {{in comparison to}} {{most of the rest of}} Europe. In Greater Poland and Lesser Poland at the end of the 16th century, for example, 30% of the population lived in cities. 256 towns were founded, most in Red Ruthenia. The townspeople's upper layer was ethnically multinational and tended to be well-educated. Numerous sons of burghers studied at the Academy of Kraków and at foreign universities; members of their group are among the finest contributors to the culture of the Polish Renaissance. Unable to form their own nationwide political class, many blended into the nobility in spite of the legal obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Following the French Revolution in 1789, a {{political}} organisation {{was formed in}} Ireland named the Society of United Irishmen. Crossing social and religious boundaries, this organisation embraced republican principles with the stated goal of removing British government control from Ireland. When Britain went to war with the French Republic in 1793, the organisation was declared illegal and driven under cover, many of its senior members going into exile <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>or</b> America. These men continued to call for armed resistance to the British government, and in 1796 persuaded the French Directory to launch the Expédition d'Irlande, a large scale invasion of Ireland. The expedition was a disaster, with thousands of French soldiers drowned without a single man successfully landed. Subsequently, the French-controlled government of the Batavian Republic, formerly the Dutch Republic, was persuaded to make an attempt on Ireland in October 1797, but their fleet was intercepted and defeated by Admiral Adam Duncan at the Battle of Camperdown.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the spread}} of such ideas was {{forbidden}} in the Spanish territories, as was the sale of related books or their unauthorized possession. Spain instituted those bans when it declared war on France after the execution of LouisXVI and retained them after the peace treaty of 1796. News {{of the events of}} 1789 and copies of the publications of the French Revolution spread around Spain despite efforts to keep them at bay. Many enlightened criollos came into contact with liberal authors and their works during their university studies, either <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>or</b> at the University of Chuquisaca (modern Sucre). Books from the United States found their way into the Spanish colonies through Caracas, owing to the proximity of Venezuela to the United States and the West Indies.|$|E
5|$|In the camp, {{the detainees}} {{suffered}} from tropical diseases and inadequate food and clothing. Jewish {{organizations such as}} the South African Jewish Board of Deputies, the Jewish Agency, and the Zionist Federation, sent food, clothing, medicine, and religious items to the detainees. Initially, a ban on interaction between the sexes was enforced; the men were held in a former jailhouse and the women in adjacent iron huts. After the ban was lifted, 60 children were born in the camp. In total, 128 prisoners died in the camp, and were buried in the Jewish section of St. Martin Cemetery. At the end of World War II, the detainees were given the choice of returning to their former homes <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>or</b> immigrating to Palestine. Most chose Palestine, and on August 6, 1945, 1,320 landed in Haifa.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} who {{originally}} suggested the yellow, green and red, but the idea is usually attributed to Lithuanian exiles living elsewhere <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>or</b> in the United States during the 19th century. These three colors were frequently used in folk weavings and traditional dress. At the Great Seimas of Vilnius of 1905, this flag was favored over the Vytis banner as {{the flag of the}} Lithuanian nation. The Vytis, strongly advocated by Jonas Basanavičius, was not chosen for three reasons: the first was that as part of the drive for national identity, the Seimas wished to distance itself somewhat from the flag of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which also encompassed now-distinct nations such as Belarus, and Ukraine. The second issue was the choice of the color red by revolutionaries who aligned themselves with Marxist or Communist causes. And finally, the flag with Vytis would be too complicated and could not be easily sewn.|$|E

5|$|Once {{purchased}} by Sightholders (which is a trademark term {{referring to the}} companies that have a three-year supply contract with DTC), diamonds are cut and polished in preparation for sale as gemstones ('industrial' stones are regarded as a by-product of the gemstone market; they are used for abrasives). The cutting and polishing of rough diamonds is a specialized skill that is concentrated in {{a limited number of}} locations worldwide. Traditional diamond cutting centers are Antwerp, Amsterdam, Johannesburg, New York City, and Tel Aviv. Recently, diamond cutting centers have been established in China, India, Thailand, Namibia and Botswana. Cutting centers with lower cost of labor, notably Surat in Gujarat, India, handle a larger number of smaller carat diamonds, while smaller quantities of larger or more valuable diamonds {{are more likely to be}} handled <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>or</b> North America. The recent expansion of this industry in India, employing low cost labor, has allowed smaller diamonds to be prepared as gems in greater quantities than was previously economically feasible.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{soundtrack of}} Ocarina of Time {{was published by}} Pony Canyon and released in Japan on December 18, 1998. It comprises one compact disc with 82 tracks. A US version was also released, although with fewer tracks and different packaging artwork. Many critics praised the music in Ocarina of Time, although IGN was disappointed that the traditional Zelda overworld theme was not included. In 2001, {{three years after the}} initial release of Ocarina of Time, GameSpot labeled it {{as one of the top}} ten video game soundtracks. The soundtrack, at the time, was not released <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>or</b> Australia. In 2011, however, a 51-track limited edition soundtrack for the 3DS version was available in a free mail out through a Club Nintendo offer to owners of the 3DS edition, as an incentive to register the product. The original musical theme for the Fire Temple area was altered before release of the game, due to Nintendo's policy of not including real religious references in their products, with the altered theme simply removing the chanting samples.|$|E
