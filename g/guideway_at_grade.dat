50|$|According to {{government}} school performance indicators, Stafford Grammar School {{is one of}} the top schools in Staffordshire. In 2010, 100% of A-level results were <b>at</b> <b>grades</b> A*-E with 68% being <b>at</b> <b>grades</b> A*-B, <b>at</b> AS level 98% of results were <b>at</b> <b>grades</b> A-E with 64% being <b>at</b> <b>grades</b> A-B and 97% of GCSE results were <b>at</b> <b>grades</b> A*-C with 53% being <b>at</b> <b>grades</b> A/A*. 100% of students achieved the benchmark of 5 or more GCSE passes <b>at</b> <b>grades</b> A*-C including English and Mathematics. In the academic year that finished in June 2006 the school was ranked top in Staffordshire based on league table results. In 2009, 95% of pupils at the school gained five or more GCSEs <b>at</b> <b>grade</b> C or above, placing it second in the county's ranking of secondary schools.|$|R
25|$|In Transrapid vehicle {{versions}} TR08 and earlier, when travelling {{at speeds}} below , the vehicle levitation system and all on-board vehicle electronics were supplied with power through physical {{connections to the}} track <b>guideway.</b> <b>At</b> vehicle speeds above , all on-board power was supplied by recovered harmonic oscillation of the magnetic fields created from the trackâ€™s linear stator. (Since these oscillations are parasitic, they cannot be used for vehicle propulsion). A new energy transmission system, version TR09, has since been developed for Transrapid, in which maglev vehicles now require no physical contact with the track guideway for their on-board power needs, regardless of the maglev vehicle speed. This feature helps to reduce on-going maintenance and operational costs.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a {{framework}} to analyze the interaction between an actively controlled magnetic levitation vehicle and a guideway structure under gusty wind. The equation of motion is presented for a 30 -dof maglev vehicle model consisting of one cabin and four bogies. In addition, a lateral electromagnetic suspension (EMS) system is introduced to improve the running safety and ride quality of the maglev vehicle subjected to turbulent crosswind. By using the developed simulation tools, the effects of various parameters on the dynamic response of the vehicle and guideway are investigated in the case of the UTM maglev vehicle running on a simply supported guideway and cable-stayed guideway. The simulation results show that the independent lateral EMS and associated control scheme are definitely helpful in improving the running safety and ride quality of the vehicle under gusty wind. In the case of the cable-stayed <b>guideway,</b> <b>at</b> low wind speed, vehicle speed is the dominant factor influencing the dynamic responses of the maglev vehicle and the <b>guideway,</b> but <b>at</b> wind speed over 10 [*]m/s, wind becomes the dominant factor. For the ride quality of the maglev vehicle, wind is also the most influential factor...|$|R
