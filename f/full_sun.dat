5|$|E. reichenbachii prefer <b>full</b> <b>sun</b> {{and require}} little water. They thrive in dry, well-drained, gravelly, clay, and loam soils, and near rock outcroppings. They are cold and heat tolerant, and grow well under glass. They are drought resistant, but {{susceptible}} to mealybugs and scale insects.|$|E
5|$|Successful birch {{cultivation}} {{requires a}} climate cool enough {{for at least}} the occasional winter snowfall. As they are shallow-rooted, they may require water during dry periods. They grow best in <b>full</b> <b>sun</b> planted in deep, well-drained soil.|$|E

5|$|Not {{commonly}} cultivated, it adapts {{readily to}} garden conditions and tolerates most soils in part-shade or <b>full</b> <b>sun.</b> The colours of the inflorescences in bud, {{and timing of}} flowers into winter give it horticultural value, as does its reddish new growth. Larger plants have taller flower spikes. It is propagated readily from seed, with young plants taking {{five to seven years}} to flower from seed. Pruning can improve the shrub's appearance, and it is a potential bonsai subject.|$|E
5|$|Adenanthos cuneatus {{was taken}} to Great Britain in 1824, and has been grown in {{cultivation}} in Australia and the western United States. Its attractive bronzed or reddish foliage is its main horticultural feature, along with its ability to attract birds to the garden. It requires a well-drained position to do well, but will grow in <b>full</b> <b>sun</b> or semi-shade, and tolerates both sand and gravelly soils. George Lullfitz, a Western Australian nurseryman, recommends growing it as a rambling ground cover in front of other shrubs, or in a rockery.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they grow}} {{naturally}} on deep sandy soils, the species has proved adaptable to other deep, well-drained soils, especially where natural slopes assist drainage. Despite their natural occurrence in woodland, waratahs flower best in <b>full</b> <b>sun,</b> although they tolerate the dappled shade of eucalypts. Heavy pruning after flowering reinvigorates {{the plants and}} promotes more profuse flowering in the next season. Waratah blooms are highly susceptible to damage from wind, and benefit from some protection from prevailing winds. Waratah blooms attract birds to the garden. The species is readily propagated from fresh seed, but cultivars must be reproduced from cuttings to remain true-to-type.|$|E

5|$|Banksia acanthopoda {{is little}} known in cultivation, {{although}} it has been successfully grown and propagated at The Banksia Farm in Mount Barker, Western Australia, and at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Cranbourne, Melbourne. It is a sprawling and untidy shrub, but its habit can be improved by pruning. Its prominent yellow flower heads appear from July to October in cultivation, and have potential for use in the cut flower industry. It prefers a well-drained soil in <b>full</b> <b>sun</b> or light shade, and will tolerate dry conditions once established. Propagation is by seed; seeds take three to five weeks to germinate, and have a germination rate of 80 to 90 percent.|$|E
5|$|Banksia aculeata grows slowly, {{generally}} taking five to {{six years}} to flower from seed, {{though there is a}} report of it flowering in three years at Strathmerton in Victoria. Regarding its potential as an ornamental plant, Alex George observes that the flowers are brightly coloured but have a short life and are obscured by the foliage, which is quite prickly. He nonetheless considers both the new foliage and the infructescence attractive. This species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal soil pH range is from 5.5 to 6.5. It prefers <b>full</b> <b>sun,</b> although it will grow in partly shaded situations, producing fewer flowers. It will tolerate light pruning.|$|E
5|$|Propagation is by seed, {{although}} these {{are hard to}} obtain. Seeds do not require any treatment before sowing, and take around 23 days to germinate. Cuttings yield unpredictable results. The plant itself prefers a deep, sandy, well-drained soil with a pH of 6.0–7.0. It requires <b>full</b> <b>sun,</b> but some protection from the wind is recommended, as this is a fast-growing plant with spindly branches that are easily damaged by wind. A more compact form {{can be obtained by}} pruning the top quarter each year. This species has little appeal to the cut flower industry because of its prickly foliage, and its tendency to drip nectar.|$|E

50|$|The {{habitat of}} the purple copper {{butterfly}} is found primarily in altitudes above 900 m (3000 ft), and are generally seen with {{exposure to the}} <b>full</b> day <b>sun</b> (often with a west to north appearance), and with extremes of cold such as regular winter snowfalls or heavy frosts where it feeds on a form of blackthorn.|$|R
5|$|Seeds do {{not require}} any treatment, and take 23 to 50 days to {{germinate}} in cultivation. Banksia caleyi is a medium- to slow-growing plant, taking {{four to five years}} to flower from seed. The flowers are attractive but are obscured by the foliage. This species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal soil pH range is from 6 to 7.5. It grows in <b>full</b> <b>sun</b> and partly shaded situations, and tolerates light pruning. Unlike many other Western Australian banksias, Banksia caleyi has had some degree of success in growing in more humid areas, such as Australia's east coast. It attracts pygmy and honey possums in the garden.|$|E
5|$|To the west, in Gujarat, diverse climate {{conditions}} obtain. The winters are mild, pleasant, and dry with average daytime temperatures around 29°C (84°F) and nights around 12°C (54°F) with virtually <b>full</b> <b>sun</b> and clear nights. Summers are hot and dry with daytime temperatures around 41°C (106°F) and nights no lower than 29°C (84°F). In {{the weeks before}} the monsoon temperatures {{are similar to the}} above, but high humidity makes the air more uncomfortable. Relief comes with the monsoon. Temperatures are around 35°C (95°F) but humidity is very high; nights are around 27°C (81°F). Most of the rainfall occurs in this season, and the rain can cause severe floods. The sun is often occluded during the monsoon season.|$|E
5|$|Hippeastrum {{species are}} {{concentrated}} in two centres of diversity, the main one in Eastern Brazil {{and the other in}} the central southern Andes of Peru, Bolivia and Argentina, on the eastern slopes and nearby foothills. Some species are found as far north as Mexico and the West Indies. The genus is thought to have originated in Brazil where at least 34 of the species have been found. Their habitat is mainly tropical and subtropical, though those species found south of the equator, or at sufficient altitude may be considered temperate. Hippeastrum is found {{in a wide range of}} habitats. Many are found in underbrush, while others prefer <b>full</b> <b>sun.</b> Hippeastrum angustifolium is an example of a species preferring flood areas, while other species prefer a drier habitat. There are also epiphytic species such as Hippeastrum aulicum, Hippeastrum calyptratum, Hippeastrum papilio and Hippeastrum arboricola, which require air circulation around their roots, which are in the subgenus Omphalissa.|$|E
