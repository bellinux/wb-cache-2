25|$|Undistracted, the besiegers {{meanwhile}} started digging covered trenches inward {{from the}} circumvallation line toward the hornworks of the fortress, {{which had been}} constructed by the Dutch themselves {{on the model of}} a star fort. Two of these trenches were dug toward the Ginnekenpoort (Ginneken Gate), one by French, the other by English mercenaries. The French finished their work on 27 August, the English one day later. <b>Fascines</b> were used to fill the moat. The French and English scaled the walls of the hornwork on 1 September. That same night, the French ambassador Girard de Charnacé, who commanded a French regiment of the besiegers, was adventitiously killed by a bullet to the head.|$|E
25|$|The {{main attack}} began in {{darkness}} {{and a heavy}} fog, but as the British neared the main enemy line the fog lifted, exposing them to withering artillery fire. Lt-Col. Thomas Mullins, the British commander of the 44th (East Essex) Regiment of Foot, had forgotten the ladders and <b>fascines</b> needed to cross the eight-foot-deep and fifteen-foot-wide canal and scale the earthworks, and {{in the dark and}} fog confusion descended as the British tried to close the gap. Most of the senior officers were killed or wounded, including Major General Samuel Gibbs, who was killed leading the main attack column on the right comprising the 4th, 21st, 44th and 5th West India Regiments, and Colonel Rennie who led a detachment of three light companies of the 7th, 43rd, and 93rd on the left by the river.|$|E

25|$|The {{outer walls}} were {{breached}} after {{only two days}} of mining, when Timur ordered the <b>fascines</b> supporting the tunnels lit. The result was an explosion that destroyed the wall and buried the defenders in rubble. Timur's forces then entered the city. After some desultory fighting, the Knights fled to their ships, while the Christian inhabitants were massacred. Some ships that were approaching the city with aid turned back {{in the face of}} the siege engines, either because of the danger of stone projectiles or because the heads of the massacred were launched at them. The city itself, or that part of it under crusader control, was completely destroyed. The siege had lasted nearly fifteen days. Some knights managed to escape on galleys, including the castellan, Íñigo de Alfaro.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{universal}} blame {{was assigned}} to Colonel Mullins, of the 44th Regiment, which was detailed under orders to prepare and have ready, and to carry to the front {{on the morning of}} the eighth, <b>fascines</b> and ladders with which to cross the ditch and scale the parapet, as the soldiers fought their way to the breastwork of the Americans. It was freely charged that the Colonel deserted his trust and at the moment of need was half a mile to the rear. It was then that Pakenham, learning of Mullins' conduct, placed himself at the head of the 44th and endeavored to lead them to the front with the implements needed to storm the works, when at around 500 yards away from the enemy front line, he fell wounded after being hit with grapeshot. On being assisted onto a horse, Pakenham was hit again and fell, this time mortally wounded.|$|E
25|$|Among tank units, {{equipped}} with the T-26, {{the actions of the}} 35th Light Tank Brigade (commander – colonel V.N. Kashuba, from January 1940 – colonel F.G. Anikushkin) were the most noteworthy. The brigade had 136 T-26 tanks of different models, 10 KhT-26 flame-throwing tanks and 3 ST-26 engineer tanks on 30 November 1939. In the beginning, the brigade was involved into combat for Kiviniemi and later it was redeployed to Hottinen area where its tanks, suffering high losses and shortage of repair facilities, supported the attacks of the 123rd and the 138th Rifle Divisions till the end of December. On 17 December 1939, Colonel V.N. Kashuba was heavily wounded while raised infantrymen hitting the dirt during the attack of Finnish defense line. In January tankers of the 35th Brigade evacuated and repaired their T-26s, practised in cooperation with artillery, engineer and rifle units (the last ones often retreated under enemy fire and left tanks alone), manufactured wooden <b>fascines</b> for trench crossing which were placed in special towed sleds. By the breakthrough of the main defensive positions of the Mannerheim Line, battalions of the brigade were attached to the 100th, the 113th and the 123rd Rifle Divisions.|$|E

500|$|As {{the range}} closed the Allies became easy {{targets for the}} Franco-Bavarian musket- and grape-shot; the {{confusion}} exacerbated by fizzing hand-grenades thrown down the slope by the defenders. To aid their assault, each Allied soldier carried a bundle of <b>fascines</b> (earlier cut from the Boschberg wood), with which to bridge the ditches {{in front of the}} breastworks to speed their passage. However, the <b>fascines</b> were mistakenly thrown into a dry gully– formed by the recent summer rains– instead of the Bavarians' defensive trench about 45 m (50yards) farther on. Nevertheless, the Allies continued to push forward, joining battle with the Bavarians in savage hand-to-hand fighting. Behind the defences the Elector's Guards and la Colonie's men bore the brunt of the attack so that, [...] "The little parapet which separates the two forces became the scene of the bloodiest struggle that could be conceived." [...] But the assault failed to penetrate the defences, and the Allies were forced to fall back to their lines.

500|$|Plans to {{re-route}} the outfall along a {{new channel}} which {{would meet the}} River Witham at The Scalp, near Boston, were authorised in 1794, but the money could not be raised at the time, due to the financial crisis caused by the French Wars. Grundy's shorter channel had been finished by 1810, improving both drainage and navigation. James Walker reported in 1835 on further improvements, making the recommendation that the river below Spalding should be constrained between high banks, so that the scouring action of the water would dredge its own channel. Rather than excavating, which he estimated would cost £70,000, he suggested using <b>fascines</b> made of thorn branches, around which silt would be deposited. Such a scheme would only cost £13,000, and the work went on for many years. The effects of the embankments had resulted {{in the bed of}} the river below Fosdyke being around [...] lower by 1845. In 1867, the River Welland Outfall Act enabled the trustees to raise money to repair the walls where the tide had washed away some of the fill behind the <b>fascines.</b> A dredger was employed between 1889 and 1890, which had been invented by a Mr Harrison, the superintendent of works.|$|E

500|$|The Schellenberg heights {{dominate}} the skyline {{to the northeast}} of Donauwörth– the walled town on {{the confluence of the}} Wörnitz and Danube rivers. With one flank of the hill protected by dense, impenetrable trees of the Boschberg wood, and the river Wörnitz and marshes protecting its southern and western quarters, the Schellenberg heights offer a commanding position for any defender. However, its oval shaped summit was flat and open, and its 70-year-old defences, including an old fort built by the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus during the Thirty Years' War, were neglected and in a dilapidated state. When the unexpected attack took place the bastions, the curtain, and the ditch were fairly complete along the long eastern face from the shore of the Danube to the wooded hilltop, but in the shorter section from the wood to the fort– the angle where Marlborough's attack was delivered– the earthwork had been more hastily made up of <b>fascines</b> of brushwood thinly covered with soil. The western section of the lines ran steeply downhill from the fort to the city walls. Here, there was little to show in terms of defences, but to compensate the line could be protected by a flanking fire from the town. (See 'Schellenberg' map below.) ...|$|E
2500|$|... 43rd Division {{was next}} tasked with {{capturing}} Xanten. Again, {{the town was}} protected by an anti-tank ditch. Lieutenant-Colonel Henniker had 553 Fd Co build a 70-foot (20m) Bailey on skids improvised by 207 Fd Pk Co. This was towed [...] down the road by two AVREs of 81st Assault Squadron, RE, from 79th Armoured Division, accompanied by an AVRE with a 'Jumbo' scissors bridge, two more AVREs with <b>fascines,</b> two armoured bulldozers and 20 three-ton lorries loaded with rubble. The intention was to launch the Bailey bridge over the gap where the road crossed the ditch, while the AVREs and a platoon of 260th Fd Co would make a second crossing. If the Bailey was unsuccessful the bulldozers would fill the crater with rubble. Half an hour before first light on 8 March, the engineer column advanced up the road behind the barrage with the assaulting infantry, supported by Churchill Crocodiles. It emerged that {{the gap in the}} road was in fact two craters, too long for the Bailey on skids, and the <b>fascines</b> failed to provide a passable crossing for tracked vehicles, despite the efforts of 260th Fd Co. However, the AVRE bridgelayer was successful in bridging the ditch some 50 yards (45m) from the crater, and the Crocodiles, tanks and infantry passed over. The redundant Bailey section on the road was pulled back with difficulty before 260 Fd Co's lorries could begin delivering rubble. Under heavy fire they constructed a crossing for wheeled vehicles by midday on 9 March. Xanten fell {{by the end of the}} day and by 10.40 on 11 March, no Germans remained west of the Rhine and they blew their last bridges over the river.|$|E
2500|$|West of the Yperlee Canal, the {{bridgehead}} {{consisted of}} a semi-circular work, which was built above ground, due to the waterlogged soil. Reinforced concrete shelters had been built and connected by a raised trench of concrete, earth and <b>fascines,</b> with a communication trench leading back to a command post. Several hundred yards forward on the causeway was a small blockhouse, joined to the work by a communication trench {{on the north side}} of the road. Barbed wire entanglements had been laid above and below the water in front of the post and blockhouse, astride the Noordschoote–Luyghem road.

Only a platoon of infantry should work with each tank, to avoid bunching when moving through lanes in barbed wire made by the tanks and that infantry should move in section files.

2500|$|Spitfire was one {{of eight}} gundalows built in Skenesborough (later renamed Whitehall). These gundalows, {{outfitted}} as gunboats, were built without plans though the shipwrights followed basic dimensions and instructions written by Benedict Arnold. The design of the American gunboats shows {{a balance between the}} need for rapid construction and effectiveness for their intended purpose. The gunboats all followed a common pattern. They were mostly decked over, with the middle third of the hull being open down to the bilge, thus dividing the deck into three sections. The low middle platform abaft the mast held the two broadside cannon (usually 9-pounders) and a fireplace. The guns were not opposite of each other in order to give more room to work them. The bow platform held the bow gun, usually a 9 or 12-pounder. Cannons were in short supply, so {{in the case of the}} gunboat [...] the bow gun was of Swedish origin cast about 100 years earlier. The stern platform held the helmsman and officers. This platform also held two arms chests. The rail caps had sockets for oarlocks, pivot guns and stanchions for awnings. Later on, <b>fascines</b> were added to the rail caps for protection against small arms fire. The gunboats carried positions for 12 oars, 6 per side. The rigging consisted of a single mast with a square mainsail and a topsail. To counteract the weight of the bow gun, the stern area held stones for ballast. Due to their square sails and flat, shallow bottoms the gunboats could only sail in wind blowing from astern.(Chapelle 1949:110f; Delgado 2001:97f; Nelson 2006:235ff, 250f) ...|$|E
