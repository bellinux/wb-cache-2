25|$|Conch is most {{indigenous}} to The Bahamas, and is typically served in fritter, salad, and soup forms. In addition to The Bahamas, conch is also eaten in the West Indies (Jamaica in particular); locals in Jamaica eat conch in soups, stews and curries. Restaurants {{all over the}} islands serve this particular meat. In the Dominican Republic, Grenada, and Haiti, conch is commonly eaten in curries or in a spicy soup. It is locally referred to as lambi. In The Turks and Caicos Islands, the Annual Conch Festival is held in November each year, located at the Three Queen's Bar/Restautant in Blue Hills. Local restaurateurs compete for {{the best and most}} original conch dishes, that are then judged by international chefs. Free sampling of the dishes follows the judging; along with those festivities, other competitions, events, and music performances occur well into the evening. In Puerto Rico, conch is served as a ceviche, often called ensalada de carrucho (conch salad), consisting of raw conch marinated in lime juice, olive oil, vinegar, garlic, <b>green</b> <b>peppers,</b> and onions. It is also used to fill empanadas.|$|E

500|$|The Armenian {{version of}} borscht {{is a hot}} soup made with beef stock, <b>green</b> <b>peppers</b> and other vegetables, {{which may or may}} not include beetroots, and flavored with parsley and cilantro.

In Chinese cuisine, a soup known as , or [...] "Russian soup", is based on red cabbage and tomatoes, and lacks beetroots altogether; also known as [...] "Chinese borscht", it originated in Harbin, close to the Russian border in northeast China, and has spread as far as Hong Kong. In Shanghai's Haipai cuisine, tomatoes are the main ingredient; beef and its broth, onions and cabbages are also added, while flour, rather than sour cream, is used for thickening.|$|E
500|$|Former Nice {{mayor and}} {{cookbook}} author Jacques Médecin was a strict salad traditionalist. His 1972 cookbook Cuisine Nicoise: Recipes from a Mediterranean Kitchen {{called for the}} salad to be served in a wooden bowl rubbed with garlic, and excluded boiled vegetables: [...] "never, never, I beg you, include boiled potato or any other boiled vegetable in your salade niçoise." [...] Médecin wrote that the salad should be made [...] "predominately of tomatoes" [...] which should be [...] "salted three times and moistened with olive oil". Hard-boiled eggs were added, and either anchovies or canned tuna, [...] but not both. He incorporated raw vegetables such as cucumbers, purple artichokes, <b>green</b> <b>peppers,</b> fava beans, spring onions, black olives, basil and garlic, but no lettuce or vinegar. According to Rowley Leigh, Médecin believed that salade niçoise [...] "was {{a product of the}} sun and had to be vibrant with the crisp, sweet flavours of the vegetables of the Midi." [...] Médecin advocated presenting the dish as a composed salad, [...] commenting, [...] "As the various ingredients that go into salade niçoise are of bright and contrasting colours, they can be arranged most decoratively in the salad bowl." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another item {{prepared}} like roti is bake or bakes or floats. A Guyanese or Trinidadian fry bake {{seems to}} be more similar to an Indian puri. A bake is made with butter or margarine and has a different ratio of flour to fat. It is made much quicker than roti and is usually made in the mornings. Dough is rolled out and cut into shapes or rolled into small rounds. Guyanese bakes are fried, but bakes {{from other parts of the}} West Indies can be baked in an oven. Bakes are usually paired with a quick fry-up for breakfast or dinner, stewed saltfish, or eggs ("western" [...] style, with onions, tomatoes, <b>green</b> <b>peppers).</b> Bakes are also made in other parts of the West Indies including Trinidad, Barbados and St. Vincent. In Trinidad and Tobago, a [...] "bake and shark" [...] is a popular street food sandwich in which fried shark is sandwiched between two halves of a sliced bake with a plethora of local condiments. Pepper sauce, shado beni, garlic sauce, tamarind and mango chutney are most common as well as lettuce, tomato and cucumber for fillers.|$|E

The flowers were every gay autumnal sort, especially dahlias, sometimes made into stiff bouquets, perhaps for church offerings.
