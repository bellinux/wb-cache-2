As with their World War II predecessors, the newer jet aircraft proved capable of providing close air support for <b>ground</b> <b>based</b> troops, and were instrumental in aiding UN ground forces during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir.|$|E
5|$|Increased fire {{monitoring}} through <b>ground</b> <b>based</b> and {{aerial reconnaissance}} has been implemented to quickly determine how a particular fire will be managed. Fire monitors first {{determine whether a}} fire is human-caused or natural. All human-caused fires are suppressed since they are unnatural, while natural fires are monitored. Fire monitors map the fire perimeter, record local weather, and examine the types of fuels burning {{and the amount of}} fuel available. Additionally, they investigate the rate of spread, flame lengths, fuel moisture content, and other characteristics of each fire. Monitors relay the information they gather to fire managers who then make determinations on future actions.|$|E
5|$|The {{first thing}} {{he had to do}} was {{determine}} the characteristics of the aircraft that would be used. There were only two Allied aircraft large enough: the British Avro Lancaster and the US Boeing B-29 Superfortress. The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) wanted to use the B-29 if at all possible, even though it required substantial modification. Ramsey supervised the test drop program, which began at Dahlgren, Virginia, in August 1943, before moving to Muroc Dry Lake, California, in March 1944. Mock ups of Thin Man and Fat Man bombs were dropped and tracked by an SCR-584 <b>ground</b> <b>based</b> radar set of the kind that Ramsey had helped develop at the Radiation laboratory. Numerous problems were discovered with the bombs and the aircraft modifications, and corrected.|$|E

5|$|It {{was planned}} to launch four {{satellites}} in December 1962. However, before the launches could take place, then Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara cancelled the program, due to concerns {{that it would}} not be able to operate if a full scale nuclear war broke out, and that only a small number of SAINTs could be launched at a time. The project had also gone over budget, spending over 100 million dollars, which was several times the funding that had been publicly reported. By the end of the 1960s, the concept of inspecting Soviet satellites was abandoned as the Soviets had begun installing destruction packages on their satellites, that would blow up both itself and the SAINT, by use of the APO-2 destruction system, which could either be set off by its operators in the USSR, or if it sensed that it was being scanned. The standard American military reconnaissance satellite was capable of scanning other satellites long range, along with <b>ground</b> <b>based</b> detection of satellites.|$|E
5|$|The Vietnam War saw the {{introduction}} of helicopter gunships which could be employed to support <b>ground</b> <b>based</b> forces, and the experience gained in Vietnam would spawn the creation of several aircraft {{during and after the}} war designed specifically to aid ground forces, including the AC-47 Spooky, Fairchild AC-119, Lockheed AC-130, and A-10 Thunderbolt II, all of which are operated by the Air Force, and the F/A-18 Hornet which is operated by the navy. In addition, the army and marine corps operate UH-1 Iroquois, AH-1 Cobra, and AH-64 Apache helicopters for close air support, and these helicopters can be stationed onboard amphibious assault ships to provide ship-to-shore air support for ground forces. These aircraft would later prove instrumental in aiding ground forces from the 1980s onwards, and would be involved in the 1991 Gulf War, the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Sharon {{began on}} 19 September with a Western Front style {{bombardment}} during which {{two thirds of}} the mainly <b>ground</b> <b>based</b> heavy artillery, supported by the firepower of two destroyers pounded Ottoman positions, while one third of the heavy artillery fired creeping barrages to cover the infantry assaults. The XXI Corps infantry attacked simultaneously along the front line from the Mediterranean coast where the 60th Division, launched an attack on the western coastal section of the front line defended by the Eighth Army's XXII Corps. During this Battle of Tulkarm the 60th Division breached the front and second line trenches to eventually capture Tulkarm, the site of the Eighth Army headquarters. On their right, the main Tabsor system of trenches held by the Ottoman XXII Corps was attacked and eventually captured during the Battle of Tabsor, by the 3rd (Lahore), 7th (Meerut), and the 75th Divisions. These three divisions subsequently advanced, despite the Ottoman XXII Corps being reinforced, to capture Et Tire and Masudiye Station. In the process of the battles for Tulkarm and Tabsor the 7th (Meerut) and 60th Divisions created a gap in the front line, for the Desert Mounted Corps to ride through. They rode north and eastwards to the rear to capture the defending Ottoman armies' lines of communication. The right flank of the attacking XXI Corps was protected from the Eighth Army's Asia Corps, by the 54th (East Anglian) Division and the French Colonial Détachment Français de Palestine et de Syrie holding and pivoting on the Rafat salient, during the Battle of Arara as the infantry battle progressed.|$|E

The minimum aircraft attenuation was found 15. 5 dB. This value increases 5. 5 dB, in average, under the wing of the aircraft. From the interference study, it is found that even from a distance of 286 km away, interference may be caused by the <b>ground</b> <b>base</b> station to the aircraft mobile terminal. Finally, in order to prevent that a <b>ground</b> <b>base</b> station will interfere to an on-board mobile terminal an additional attenuation of 12. 3 dB is at least required.

40|$|Often a {{scenario}} arises {{in which it}} is necessary to collection information from a hostile environment and the safest {{way to do this is}} the deployment of a small unmanned ground vehicle (UGV). In this situation the UGV will move around the environment while sending a live data stream back to the <b>ground</b> <b>base.</b> However, there can be limits on the maneuverability and range of the UGV making it difficult to complete this mission. To solve this problem unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are used to assist in both the deployment of the UGV as well as handling the connection between the UGV and a <b>ground</b> <b>base.</b> Specifically, the UAV’s will intercept the data stream from the UGV and relay it to the <b>ground</b> <b>base</b> using a linear mesh network allowing for the UGV to move farther from the <b>ground</b> <b>base.</b> Due to constraints on availability and usage of drones this project is being completed in simulation with the RAMS Simulator, a drone flight simulator modified to use an external mission control system (MCS). The focus of this project is to design a MCS that can be combined with a UAV that will make it complete this mission. The UAV will increase the efficiency of the deployment and usage of the UGV in hazardous environments. Collection of data in these situations will be easier and less dangerous for those involved.

Evidence of pronounced copper segregation in the Skylab A 1 weld samples, and the tantalum samples studied, indicates a weld microhardness (and hence strength) that is uniformly higher than the <b>ground</b> <b>base</b> results, which is in agreement with previous predictions.
