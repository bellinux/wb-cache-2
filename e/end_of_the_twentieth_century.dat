5|$|By the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> <b>century,</b> the {{mechanics}} of how dew condenses were much better understood. The key insight was that low-mass collectors which rapidly lose heat by radiation perform best. A number of researchers worked on this method. In the early 1960s, dew condensers made from sheets of polyethylene supported on a simple frame resembling a ridge tent were used in Israel to irrigate plants. Saplings supplied with dew and very slight rainfall from these collectors survived {{much better than the}} control group planted without such aids– they all dried up over the summer. In 1986 in New Mexico condensers made of a special foil produced sufficient water to supply young saplings.|$|E

5|$|The spit {{is moving}} towards the {{mainland}} at about 1m per year, {{and for the}} last two hundred years maps have been accurate enough for the encroachment of the sea to be quantified. Blakeney Chapel, just west of the reserve, was 400m (440yd) from the sea in 1817, but this had reduced to 195m (215yd) by the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> <b>century.</b> The landward movement of the shingle also means that the channel of the River Glaven becomes blocked increasingly often, leading to flooding of the reserve and Cley village. The Environment Agency considered a number of remedial options to protect these vulnerable areas, and a new route for the river to the south of its original line was completed in 2007 {{at a cost of about}} £1.5million.|$|E

At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> <b>century</b> the Scottish Churches Initiative for Union (SCIFU), between the Episcopal Church, the Church of Scotland, the Methodist Church and the United Reformed Church, put forward an initiative whereby there would have been mutual recognition of all ordinations and that subsequent ordinations would have satisfied episcopal requirements, but this was rejected by the General Assembly in 2003.|$|E
25|$|Instruments {{that have}} a five-string banjo neck on a wooden body (for example, a guitar, bouzouki, or dobro body) have also been made, such as the banjola. A 20th-Century Turkish {{instrument}} similar to the banjo is called the cümbüş—which has been made into eight different hybrid instruments, including guitar, mandolin, ukulele, and oud. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> <b>century,</b> a development of the five-string banjo was the BanSitar. This features a bone bridge, giving the instrument a sitar-like resonance. A recent innovation is the patented Banjo-Tam, invented by Frank Abrams of Asheville North Carolina combining a traditional five string banjo neck with a tambourine as a rim or pot.|$|E
25|$|By the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>twentieth</b> <b>century</b> Hastings, {{along with}} most of New Zealand was {{suffering}} from the recent economic downturn with industries and freezing works closing due to the agricultural subsidy reforms in the early 1980s. However, after multimillion-dollar regeneration projects and the employment of artists, Hastings has seen a change in its aesthetics. A CBD strategy was enforced to revitalise the central retail core, while promoting Havelock North as a 'luxury boutique' destination. The strategy proved extremely successful and Hastings vacancy rates hit an all-time low in 2005. The current goal of the council is to continue developing Hastings CBD to attract additional national chains, while attracting more cafes and entertainment venues is currently active in the eastern blocks of Heretaunga St.|$|E
