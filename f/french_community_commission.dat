25|$|The <b>French</b> <b>Community</b> <b>Commission</b> {{has also}} another capacity: some {{legislative}} {{powers of the}} French Community have been devolved to the Walloon Region (for the French language area of Belgium) and to the <b>French</b> <b>Community</b> <b>Commission</b> (for the bilingual language area). The Flemish Community, however, did the opposite; it merged the Flemish Region into the Flemish Community. This is related to different conceptions in the two communities, one focusing more on the Communities and the other more on the Regions, causing an asymmetrical federalism. Because of this devolution, the <b>French</b> <b>Community</b> <b>Commission</b> can enact decrees, which are legislative acts.|$|E
25|$|The {{region was}} placed on equal footing with the Flemish Region and the Walloon Region. Nonetheless, Brussels does not have its own community; rather the Flemish Community and the French Community both have {{jurisdiction}} in Brussels. The Flemish Community Commission (VGC) and the <b>French</b> <b>Community</b> <b>Commission</b> (COCOF) were to act on their respective Communities' behalf in Brussels. Brussels divides its funding for the Communities between them, with 20% going to the VGC, and 80% to the COCOF.|$|E
25|$|The French Community and the Flemish Community {{exercise}} their powers in Brussels through two community-specific public authorities: the <b>French</b> <b>Community</b> <b>Commission</b> (French: Commission communautaire française or COCOF) and the Flemish Community Commission (Dutch: Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie or VGC). These two bodies each have an assembly {{composed of the}} members of each linguistic group of the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region. They also have a board composed of the ministers and secretaries of state of each linguistic group in the Government of the Brussels-Capital Region.|$|E
50|$|Around 30 {{scientific}} {{projects are}} developed yearly at CORE financed {{in the form}} of grants and contracts by the public and private sector, including the Belgian Federal Government, e.g., the Belgian Federal Science Policy Office, the Fund for Scientific Research - FNRS, the Belgian <b>French</b> <b>Community,</b> the European <b>Commission,</b> e. g., the European Research Council, Framework Programmes, COST Actions, various Belgian and foreign public institutions, private enterprises, etc.|$|R
50|$|In the Brussels region, {{there is}} another form of {{intermediate}} government, constituted by institutions {{from each of the}} two competent communities. Those institutions (COCOF for the French-speakers and VGC for the Flemings) have similar competencies, although only COCOF has legislative powers, given by the <b>French</b> <b>Community.</b> For Brussels community matters common to both communities there is a Common <b>Community</b> <b>Commission.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Common <b>Community</b> <b>Commission</b> (Commission communautaire commune, Gemeenschappelijke Gemeenschapscommissie) is {{responsible}} for Brussels community matters that are common to both the <b>French</b> <b>Community</b> and the Flemish Community and for institutions that fall within the competencies of the Communities but do not belong exclusively to either Community in the Brussels-Capital Region of Belgium. Examples of this include the bilingual hospitals in the Brussels Region.|$|R

50|$|Unlike laws, decrees are {{not subject}} to royal assent.

25|$|A bi-communitarian public authority, the Common <b>Community</b> <b>Commission</b> (French: Commission communautaire commune, COCOM, Dutch: Gemeenschappelijke Gemeenschapscommissie, GGC) also exists. Its {{assembly}} {{is composed}} {{of the members of}} the regional parliament, and its board are the ministers – not the secretaries of state – of the region, with the minister-president not having the right to vote. This Commission has two capacities: it is a decentralised administrative public body, responsible for implementing cultural policies of common interest. It can give subsidies and enact by-laws. In another capacity, it can also enact ordinances, which have equal status as a national legislative act, in the field of the welfare powers of the communities: in the Brussels-Capital Region, both the <b>French</b> <b>Community</b> and the Flemish Community can exercise powers in the field of welfare, but only in regard to institutions that are unilingual (for example, a private French-speaking retirement home or the Dutch-speaking hospital of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel). The Common <b>Community</b> <b>Commission</b> is responsible for policies aiming directly at private persons or at bilingual institutions (for example, the centres for social welfare of the 19 municipalities). Its ordinances have to be enacted with a majority in both linguistic groups. Failing such a majority, a new vote can be held, where a majority of at least one third in each linguistic group is sufficient.|$|R

50|$|Chapter VIII, {{the last}} chapter of Title III of the Constitution, is titled The provincial and {{municipal}} institutions. As its title suggests, this chapter describes the organisation of {{the institutions of the}} provinces and the municipalities of Belgium. It contains the Articles 162 to 166. Article 162 establishes the principles of the organisation of the provincial and municipal institutions, such as the direct election {{of the members of the}} provincial and the municipal councils. Article 163 stipulates that the functions of the provincial organs are exercised in the extraprovincial Brussels-Capital Region by the institutions of the Flemish <b>Community,</b> the <b>French</b> <b>Community,</b> the Common <b>Community</b> <b>Commission</b> and the Region. Article 165 provides that the law can create agglomerations and federations of municipalities. It also describes the functioning of theseagglomerations and federations. Article 166 describes how the preceding article applies to the municipalities of the Brussels Region.|$|R
