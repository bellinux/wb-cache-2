60|$|It {{sometimes}} happens [however] {{that two}} different commodities have {{what may be}} termed a <b>joint</b> <b>cost</b> of production. They are both products of the same operation, or set of operations, and the outlay is incurred {{for the sake of}} both together, not part for one and part for the other. The same outlay would have to be incurred for either of the two, if the other were not wanted or used at all. There are not a few instances of commodities thus associated in their production. For example, coke and coal-gas are both produced from the same material, and by the same operation. In a more partial sense, mutton and wool are an example; beef, hides, and tallow; calves and dairy produce; chickens and eggs. Cost of production can {{have nothing to do with}} deciding the value of the associated commodities relatively to each other. It only decides their joint value. Cost of production does not determine their prices, but the sum of their prices. A principle is wanting to apportion the expenses of production between the two.|$|E

Starting with a summary of the theoretical analytical tools that exist on the subject, we have attempted to reengage the preoccupation of organisational managers regarding the allocation of joint costs. Reviewing the state of art has allowed us to distinguish two allocation logics for the <b>joint</b> <b>cost</b> of co-products.

However, the complexity and the subjectivity of <b>joint</b> <b>cost</b> allocation for co-products leaves us to believe that, while it is important to choose a particular method by taking into account the stated objectives, one must still remain sufficiently cautious before sanctioning any decision making necessary for performance evaluation in situations that infer the <b>joint</b> <b>cost</b> allocation for manufacturing. management accounting; <b>joint</b> <b>cost</b> allocation; co-products; joint costs; manufacturing industry; performance evaluation; manufacturing costs...|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} a general methodology for detecting indirect per unit costs of multi-product firms. The methodology {{rests on the}} law of "no distortion" of the decision making process invoked by SCAPENS (1991). The game theory approach (SHUBIK (1962), HAMLEN, HAMLEN, TSCHIRHART (1980)) has previously exploited the idea of neutrality of <b>joint</b> <b>cost</b> allocation. It constrains the allocated costs to be conditional to the decision making process of the firm (DEMSKI, FELTHAM (1976)). We admit here that the aim is the maximization of the profit. We use the law of "no distortion" to derive a cost allocation procedure that is neutral. It says that under a fixed decision objective the optimal action is the same whatever the <b>joint</b> <b>cost</b> is allocated or not. When the main objective of the firm is to optimize its profit, the condition of "no distorsion" of the profit maximization processis the following one. The proportionality of the allocated costs and the proportionality fot the marginal costs must be the same for all pairs of products. The only cost allocation method that replies on this understanding {{presents a}}s a procedure of distribution in proportion to the cost volume elasticities. This procedure involves that allocated costs reflect marginal costs. Moreover, it explicitly takes into account the impact of economies of scale. We show that the dependence between allocated costs, marginal costs and economies of scale, is intrinsic to the problem of the <b>joint</b> <b>cost</b> allocation. Therefore, this last one becomes truly relevant only when the <b>joint</b> <b>cost</b> fonction is not homogenous. The law of "no distortion" is very general since the rusulting neutral allocation rule is closely dependent upon the assumptions concerning the profit function. Thus, the methodology extends without difficulties to more sophisticated cases. For example, we could use the information contained in the complexity of the production process (may be expressed in terms of activity centers). One also could extend the analysis to the case where the economic environment is uncertain, risky and intertempora...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Nonprofit {{organizations}} {{are subject to}} an unrelated business income tax on the portion of their activities that {{is not related to}} their primary exempt purpose. Taxable activities are nonprofits ’ fastest growing revenue source although, on average, nonprofits report significant losses on these taxable operations. Prior research finds that these losses are largely caused by <b>joint</b> <b>cost</b> allocations from tax-exempt to taxable activities. We use these <b>joint</b> <b>cost</b> allocations as a measure of nonprofit tax reporting aggressiveness and find that these allocations are increasing in marginal tax rates, the use of paid preparers, financial need, and complementarities, and decreasing in audit risk and reputation. These findings have implications for the efficiency and equity of the tax on nonprofits ’ unrelated activities and suggest that, despite having differing overall objective functions, nonprofits respond to tax incentives in ways similar to for-profit corporations and individual taxpayers...|$|E
40|$|Transfusion {{services}} in England provide a joint platelet product {{and a more}} costly, but better quality, non-joint alternative. Unfortunately, management is unsure of the optimal manufacturing balance between the two because, for reasons of accounting expediency, all <b>joint</b> <b>costs</b> are allocated to red cells and none to platelets. Purchasers and users may be unaware of this problem because of supplementary costs, incurred beyond the split-off point, that create a finite transfer price. In response, this study introduces a consensus clinical view of joint blood product manufacture, as an alternative basis for allocating <b>joint</b> <b>costs,</b> and presents pilot data. When this model is examined {{in the context of}} the accounting literature a number of parallels emerge. Furthermore, the history of transfusion points strongly to the clinical outcome value of products as the overriding driver of short-term manufacturing as well as its long-term development, lending support to the use of clinical consensus in the derivation of allocations. This contrasts with the use of quantitative red cell demand as the main cost driver in the current transfusion service model...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} the <b>joint</b> <b>cost</b> allocation problem that arises when several lots or resources {{are available to}} serve different products or divisions. We provide a two-phase model, wherein the first phase the optimal set of lots to be acquired is chosen and given the optimal set, and the products using each acquired lot is also determined. In the second phase, a stable full cost allocation method is developed that will not induce the divisions to form coalitions to reduce the allocated joint costs. Utilizing the optimal dual solution of the lot selection phase, we provide a <b>joint</b> <b>cost</b> allocation mechanism based {{on the concept of}} propensity to contribute and show that this allocation is also stable. If in the first phase there is a dual gap, then we show that there is no cost allocation in the core.

40|$|The linear {{programming}} (LP) {{approach has been}} commonly proposed for <b>joint</b> <b>cost</b> allocation purposes. Within a LP framework, the allocation rules {{are based on a}} marginal analysis. Unfortunately, the additivity property which is required to completely allocate joint costs fails in presence of capacity, institutional or environmental constraints. In this paper, we first illustrate that the non allocated part can be interpreted as a type of producer's surplus. Then, by using the information contained in the Simplex tableau we propose an original two-stage methodology based on the marginal costs and the production elasticity of input factors to achieve an additive cost allocation pattern. The distinguished feature of our approach is that it requires no more information or iterative computations than what is provided by the final Simplex tableau. A real-type refinery case study is provided. Linear programming <b>Joint</b> <b>cost</b> allocation Additivity Dual variables Simplex method...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} of how to calculate the effective credit hour costs for different departments in Higher Learning Institutions was approached in this paper using Joint Costing and Activity-Based Costing techniques. The cost of the effective credit hour in the higher learning institutions was treated as <b>joint</b> <b>cost</b> problem. The main advantage of <b>joint</b> <b>cost</b> analysis is its ability to handle multiple faculties who are using common resources up to achieve split off so that each faculty has its own separable cost. The departments within the faculty were also treated as <b>joint</b> <b>cost</b> problem as these departments use common resources up to their split off point as well. The Activity-Based Costing system (ABC) then was used because of its ability to allocate the joint costs to the corresponding faculties and departments. Furthermore, the separable costs pertaining the different departments were added to calculate the departments ’ costs. We suggest that the annual effective departmental credit-hour cost to be calculated by dividing the annual total cost of the department by the annual effective number of credit hours taught in that department. The Knapsack model was applied at each cost level to determine the optimal cost driver set for the Activity-Based costing analysis such that a tradeoff between the precision and the cost of the information obtained from the analysis was reached. The proposed model was explained using a hypothetical example of a university containing 9 faculties such tha...|$|E

40|$|There {{exists a}} joint-cost {{allocation}} {{problem in the}} public sector, particularly highlighted by the cost-based national pricing of blood products in England, supposedly derived using volume-driven activity-based costing (ABC) : an approach criticised by the implementation criteria propounded for ABC within the academic literature. In contrast, {{we believe that the}} contributions of quality-associated operations-based drivers, described within ABC, together with the net realisable value method, usually recommended as the optimal joint-cost allocation method, provide the beginnings of a solution. This paper sets out a methodological development from this platform that links allocation decisions with the issue of value. The bipolar nature of the model is based upon the combination of two types of allocation. One allocates <b>joint</b> <b>costs</b> according to the altered value of source material when competing non-joint alternative products exist. The other allocates <b>joint</b> <b>costs</b> according to product outcome values ascertained separately for the physical specification elements that comprise each of the range of joint products. The overall emphases are on academic context, model generalisation, the facilitation of cost-effective choices between joint products and non-joint alternatives, and possible future trends in the application of the method.
