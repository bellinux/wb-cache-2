500|$|It is {{reported}} that, upon arriving at Thermopylae, the Persians sent a mounted scout to reconnoiter. The Greeks {{allowed him to}} come up to the camp, observe them, and depart. Xerxes found the scout's reports {{of the size of the}} Greek force, and that the Spartans were indulging in calisthenics and combing their long hair, laughable. Seeking the counsel of Demaratus, an exiled Spartan king in his retinue, Xerxes was told the Spartans were preparing for battle, and it was their custom to adorn their hair when they were about to risk their lives. Demaratus called them [...] "the bravest men in Greece" [...] and warned the Great King they intended to dispute the pass. He emphasized that he had tried to warn Xerxes earlier in the campaign, but the king had refused to believe him. He added that if Xerxes ever managed to subdue the Spartans, [...] "there is no other nation <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> which will venture to lift a hand in their defense." ...|$|E

500|$|The 1937–1938 film tie-in serial {{comic strip}} [...] "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" [...] written by Merrill De Maris, {{one of the}} writers of the film, is centred {{primarily}} around the relationship between Snow White and the Queen. It further explores {{the source of the}} Queen's descent into a murderous envy, as she learns that the Prince came to her castle seeking the most beautiful woman <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> and is shocked when he says he meant Snow White. Like in the abandoned film concept, the Queen (here actually named Grimhilde) has the Prince arrested. In her Witch form, she later tells the captive Prince that she is {{going to get rid of}} Snow White and make him hers, while the Prince is defiant and calls her a [...] "miserable hag". This scene is followed by his escape from prison, in much less dramatic circumstances than the film's drowning concept. The film was also adapted into an other comics including in 1969, 1983, and 1991.|$|E
