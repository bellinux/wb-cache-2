25|$|According to Planck, {{there are}} three main {{conceptual}} approaches to heat. One is the microscopic or kinetic theory approach. The other two are macroscopic approaches. One is the approach through the law of conservation of energy taken as prior to thermodynamics, with a mechanical analysis of processes, for example {{in the work of}} Helmholtz. This mechanical view is taken <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>as</b> currently customary for thermodynamic theory. The other macroscopic approach is the thermodynamic one, which admits heat as a primitive concept, which contributes, by scientific induction to knowledge of the law of conservation of energy. This view is widely taken as the practical one, quantity of heat being measured by calorimetry.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} palaeontological {{indications}} of the grazing. In general, the normal {{position of the}} head can {{be determined by the}} angle between a vertical plane coinciding with the occiput of the cranium, which is always vertical, and a plane through the base of the cranium. A right or acute angle would indicate a head held high for browsing leaves at various heights. Elasmotherium had the most obtuse angle of the Rhinocerotids. It could only reach the lowest levels and therefore must have grazed habitually. This morphological feature favours the identification of the one-horned beast depicted in Rouffignac Cave (shown <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article)</b> <b>as</b> Elasmotherium and lends some validity to the bison-like restorations based on it.|$|E

2500|$|The velar consonants [...] and [...] are {{pronounced}} differently {{when they}} appear immediately after a vowel {{and are not}} geminated. In these circumstances, [...] is pronounced as a velar fricative. [...] is pronounced as a fricative, or sometimes as an affricate. This fricative or affricate is more often pronounced further back, in the uvular place of articulation (although it is represented <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>as</b> [...] ). All of these possible realizations - velar ejective fricative, uvular ejective fricative, velar ejective affricate and uvular ejective affricate - are cross-linguistically very rare sounds.

2500|$|According {{to normal}} English usage (e.g. [...] "French-speaking Canadians"), [...] "Swedish-speaking Finns" [...] means [...] "Finnish {{citizens}} that speak Swedish as their mother tongue" [...] {{and does not}} include people who have learned it as a foreign language. According to normal English usage, this can be abbreviated to Swedish Finns and Swedish speakers, and these less cumbersome expressions are preferable even when addressing people in Nordic countries in English, as for example <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article,</b> <b>as</b> long as the meaning has been explained. The reason {{an explanation of the}} normal meaning of the English expression Swedish Finns is necessary in Scandinavia is because this is often confusingly used in English translations in Sweden and Finland to refer to Finns that have moved to Sweden and to the Finnish ethnic minority that has lived there for a long time. These people should instead be called [...] "Finnish immigrants" [...] and [...] "Finnish Swedes" [...] (or [...] "Finnish ethnic minority in Sweden") respectively according to modern, unambiguous English usage. The reason they are often still called [...] "Swedish Finns" [...] or [...] "Sweden Finns" [...] is the old usage that emphasised the ethnic origin of immigrants instead of their status as citizens of the new country, but this usage is confusing and diminishing, as explained above.|$|E
