5|$|Bulker hulls {{are made}} of steel, usually mild steel. Some {{manufacturers}} have preferred <b>high-tensile</b> <b>steel</b> recently {{in order to reduce}} the tare weight. However, the use of <b>high-tensile</b> <b>steel</b> for longitudinal and transverse reinforcements can reduce the hull's rigidity and resistance to corrosion. Forged steel is used for some ship parts, such as the propeller shaft support. Transverse partitions {{are made of}} corrugated iron, reinforced at the bottom and at connections. The construction of bulker hulls using a concrete-steel sandwich has been investigated.|$|E
5|$|Recent use of <b>high-tensile</b> <b>steel</b> allows {{building}} a structure with less material and weight while retaining similar strength. However, {{because it is}} thinner than regular steel, HT steel can corrode more easily, plus it can develop metal fatigue in choppy seas.|$|E

5|$|Gliders {{are often}} {{launched}} using a stationary ground-based winch {{mounted on a}} heavy vehicle. This method is widely used at many European clubs, often {{in addition to an}} aerotow service. The engine is usually powered by LPG, petrol or diesel, though hydraulic fluid engines and electrical motors are also used. The winch pulls in a 1,000 to 2,500-metre (3,000 to 7,500ft) cable, made of <b>high-tensile</b> <b>steel</b> wire or a synthetic fiber, attached to the glider. The cable is released at a height of about 35% of the cable length after a short, steep ride. A strong headwind will result in higher launches.|$|E

25|$|The Boarhound, {{designed}} by Captain Frank Barnwell, was a two-bay biplane which used {{a method of}} steel construction which involved <b>high-tensile</b> <b>steel</b> strips, rolled into cusped and flanged sections, which were riveted together to form longerons and struts.

25|$|Bristol's design, the Type 130, was a high-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane of all-metal construction. Bristol's last monoplane design, the 1927 Bagshot, {{had suffered}} {{from lack of}} torsional rigidity in the wings leading to aileron reversal. This led to an extensive research program at Bristol {{which resulted in a}} wing design with a stressed metal skin rivetted to an internal framework consisting of multiple spars and the ribs. This was the basis of the Bombay's wing, which had seven spars, with <b>high-tensile</b> <b>steel</b> flanges and alclad webs. The aircraft had a twin-tail and a fixed tailwheel undercarriage.|$|E

25|$|Kamorta was {{originally}} {{expected to be}} built using high-tensile imported steel. But lapses in imports lead it to be built by indigenously developed special grade <b>high-tensile</b> <b>steel</b> (DMR249A) produced by state-owned Steel Authority of India from its Bhilai Steel Plant. The ships employs very low under water voice signature and radar cross-section due to its ‘X’ form of hull and superstructure.

The hull of the ship encompassed the bulk of sensors and weapon systems that were also indigenously manufactured by various Indian industries.|$|E
25|$|Though {{faster and}} more {{advanced}} than the RAF's current front line biplane fighters, {{the design of the}} Hurricane's construction was already considered to be somewhat outdated when introduced to service and resembled those used on the earlier biplanes. Hawker had decided to employ its traditional construction techniques instead of radical measures such as the adoption of a stressed-skin metal exterior. The primary structure comprised a Warren truss box-girder that made use of <b>high-tensile</b> <b>steel</b> longerons and duralumin cross-bracing, which were mechanically fastened instead of welded. Over this, a secondary structure composed of wooden formers and stringers gave the fuselage a rounded external shape, which carried a doped linen covering. The majority of the external surfaces were linen, save for a section between the cockpit and the engine cowling that used lightweight metal panels instead.|$|E

5000|$|Prestressed {{concrete}} {{is a form}} {{of concrete}} used in construction which is [...] "pre-stressed" [...] by being placed under compression prior to supporting any loads beyond its own dead weight. [...] This compression is produced by the tensioning of high-strength [...] "tendons" [...] located within or adjacent to the concrete volume, and is done to improve the performance of the concrete in service. Tendons may consist of single wires, multi-wire strands or threaded bars, and are most commonly made from <b>high-tensile</b> <b>steels,</b> carbon fibre or aramid fibre. The essence of prestressed concrete is that once the initial compression has been applied, the resulting material has the characteristics of high-strength concrete when subject to any subsequent compression forces, and of ductile high-strength steel when subject to tension forces. This can result in improved structural capacity and/or serviceability compared to conventionally reinforced concrete in many situations.|$|R

40|$|As ships become larger, {{thicker and}} higher tensile steel plate {{are used in}} shipyard. Though special {{chemical}} compositions are required for <b>high-tensile</b> <b>steels,</b> recently they are made by the TMCP (Thermo-Mechanical control process) methodology. The increased Yield / Tensile strength of TMCP steels compared to the normalized steel of same composition are induced by suppressing the formation of Ferrite and Pearlite in favor of strong and tough Bainite while being transformed from Austenite. But this Bainite phase could be vanished by another additional thermal cycle like welding and heating. As thermal deformations are deeply related by yield stress of material, the study for prediction of plate deformation by heating should reflect the principle of TMCP steels. The present study {{is related to the}} development of an algorithm which could calculate inherent strain. In this algorithm, not only the mechanical principles of thermal deformations, but also the initial portion of Bainite is considered when calculating inherent strain. Distortion analysis results by these values showed good agreements with experimental results for normalized steels and TMCP steels during welding and heating. This algorithm has also been used to create an inherent strain database of steels in Class rule...|$|R
50|$|To harden by quenching, a metal (usually {{steel or}} cast iron) must be heated above the upper {{critical}} temperature {{and then quickly}} cooled. Depending on the alloy and other considerations (such as concern for maximum hardness vs. cracking and distortion), cooling may be done with forced air or other gases, (such as nitrogen). Liquids may be used, due to their better thermal conductivity, such as oil, water, a polymer dissolved in water, or a brine. Upon being rapidly cooled, a portion of austenite (dependent on alloy composition) will transform to martensite, a hard, brittle crystalline structure. The quenched hardness of a metal depends on its chemical composition and quenching method. Cooling speeds, from fastest to slowest, go from brine, polymer (i.e. mixtures of water + glycol polymers), fresh water, oil, and forced air. However, quenching a certain steel too fast can result in cracking, which is why <b>high-tensile</b> <b>steels</b> such as AISI 4140 should be quenched in oil, tool steels such as ISO 1.2767 or H13 {{hot work tool steel}} should be quenched in forced air, and low alloy or medium-tensile steels such as XK1320 or AISI 1040 should be quenched in brine.|$|R
