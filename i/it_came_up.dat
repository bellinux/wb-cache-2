5|$|Merrick was now {{homeless}} on {{the streets}} of Leicester. His uncle, a barber named Charles Merrick, heard of his nephew's situation, sought him out and offered him accommodation in his home. Merrick continued to hawk around Leicester {{for the next two years}} but his efforts to earn a living met with little more success than before. Eventually, his disfigurement drew such negative attention from members of the public that the Commissioners for Hackney Carriages withdrew his licence when <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> for renewal. With young children to provide for, Charles could no longer afford to support his nephew. In late December 1879, now 17 years old, Merrick entered the Leicester Union Workhouse.|$|E
5|$|Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC is an American music {{publishing}} company owned by Sony through Sony Entertainment. The company was founded as {{a division of}} Associated Television (ATV) in 1955 by Lew Grade. In 1985, Michael Jackson acquired ATV Music Publishing for $47.5million. Paul McCartney, who had told Jackson {{about the importance of}} owning publishing, admitted he felt somewhat undercut by the purchase, because ATV Music Publishing owned the publishing rights to most of The Beatles' songs, although he did not enter the bidding when <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> for sale in 1984.|$|E
5|$|The Holy Trinity Church {{experienced}} {{an increase in}} interest after the episode aired, with some viewers holding their own weddings there. Backpackers also visit the church during their holidays to see the nave where Scott and Charlene were married. The church has since been used again by Neighbours to film the weddings of Harold and Madge, Libby Kennedy (Kym Valentine) and Drew Kirk (Dan Paris) and Vanessa Villante (Alin Sumarwata) and Lucas Fitzgerald (Scott Major). Charlene's wedding dress was donated to the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery by Grundy television in 1989. It has since gone {{on display in the}} Powerhouse Museum and travelled to Victoria and the UK. A copy of the episode's script, autographed by Harding, fetched £2,000 when <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> for auction in London.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{entered the}} war in December 1941 and as they {{advanced}} south towards Papua, the 49th found itself under air attack. Throughout the Kokoda Track campaign, {{an attempt was made}} to fly elements of the battalion to Kokoda to support the 39th Battalion during the Battle of Kokoda, but this proved abortive. Later, troops from the 49th Battalion joined Honner Force, an ad hoc unit tasked with conducting long-range patrols along the Goldie River to prevent the Japanese from cutting the track, {{while the rest of the}} battalion established standing patrols between the Goldie and Laloki Rivers. Although no contact was made with the Japanese, the combat role helped improve the outlook of the soldiers and morale improved. Throughout the preceding months the battalion's strength had been increased and by September 1942 it had a strength of 37 officers and 818 other ranks, including a draft of 12 officers who had been posted from experienced Second Australian Imperial Force units in August. The battalion continued to expand throughout October and November, by which time more than half its personnel had volunteered to transfer to the AIF. Training opportunities remained limited, though, even as preparations were made to send the unit into battle. As the tide of the fighting in Papua turned towards the Allies, the 49th Battalion joined the fighting on the northern coast around Buna–Gona. On the Sanananda front, the US 126th Infantry Regiment had become encircled around a position known as the Huggins Road Block on the road to Sanananda. Several attacks were launched in early December to break through to the beleaguered unit, but these all ended in failure. As ammunition began to run low, the 49th Battalion, supported by the 55th/53rd Battalion, was thrown into the battle, launching a frontal assault early on the morning of 7 December 1942. Attacking with all four companies, the 49th suffered heavily as <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> against heavy machine-gun fire from well-sited and concealed Japanese positions. Over the course of five hours, the 49th lost over 60 per cent of its assault force and the attack failed. A second attempt, supported by armour, on 19 December also failed to break through and resulted in further casualties.|$|E

25|$|From 1986 until 2003, Amtrak {{managed the}} {{entirety}} of Boston's commuter rail. It did decently, though at times had strained relations with the MBTA. Quibbles centered on equipment failures, numbers of conductors per train, and who took responsibility when trains are late. Because of these bad relations and Amtrak's repeated announcements that the contract was unreasonable, few people were surprised at Amtrak's decision not to bid again for the commuter rail contract when <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> for renewal in 2003.|$|E

25|$|Ford Motor Company had {{conducted}} the right marketing study, but <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> {{with the wrong}} product {{to fill the gap}} between Ford and Mercury. By 1958, buyers had become fascinated with economy cars, and a large car like the Edsel was seen as too expensive to buy and own. When Ford introduced the Falcon in 1960, it sold over 400,000 units in its first year. Ford's investment in expanded plant capacity and additional tooling for the Edsel helped make the company's subsequent success with the Falcon possible.|$|E
25|$|Admiral Chambers {{on board}} the Montague, 4 November 1749, was taking an {{observation}} just before noon...he observed a large ball of blue fire about three miles distant from them. They immediately lowered their topsails, but <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> so fast upon them, that, before they could raise the main tack, they observed the ball rise almost perpendicularly, and not above forty or fifty yards from the main chains when it went off with an explosion, as great as if a hundred cannons had been discharged at the same time, leaving behind it a strong sulphurous smell. By this explosion the main top-mast was shattered into pieces and the main mast {{went down to the}} keel.|$|E
25|$|At Stambridge, {{the modern}} river {{transforms}} from a fairly small channel {{to a wide}} tidal estuary. This was once {{the site of a}} tide mill. The earliest records for such a mill at Stambridge date from 1500, but apart {{from the fact that it}} was rebuilt in 1762, few other details from this period are known. However, in 1809, a new four-storey timber-framed mill was erected on the site. William Hugh Rankin leased the mill in 1824, and after enlarging the mill pond in 1858, bought the mill for £4,500 when <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> for sale in 1867. The Rankin family owned and ran the mill until 1962. A steam-powered mill was built to supplement the tide mill in 1872, but it burnt down in 1878. It was replaced by a five-storey building, constructed of brick, which became the mainstay of the business. The tidal pound gradually silted up, but the tide mill continued to be used until around 1951.|$|E

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> for {{auction in}} December 1937, when it drew the {{attention}} of the Jewish-American businessman and bibliomane Lessing J. Rosenwald. Rosenwald was certain that, should the manuscript be obtained by the Nazi German administration, it would be used to justify anti-Semitism, and insisted that his auction agent spend whatever amount of money was necessary to secure it. This was done, with one of the outbid auction attendees later discovered to be an agent of the German government. As soon as the work arrived in the United States, Rosenwald shipped it to the American Jewish Historical Society, mandating that it be sealed and hidden for 50 years. When this time period expired, the Society auctioned the manuscript for $176,000 to Erica and Ludwig Jesselson, a pair of Jewish cultural collectors and patrons. The manuscript was then donated to Yeshiva University in 1988, where it remains. In 1992 it was used as a resource by R. Po-Chia Hsia, a European history professor, to author the book Trent 1475: Stories of a Ritual Murder Trial and contribute to scholarship around the trials in Trent.|$|E

Despite being hit more than 50 times, the tank's crew remained unhurt and were able to keep firing the tank's 2 pounder until they eventually had to abandon the tank and fall back with the infantry. At this point, the Australians withdrew.|$|E

[...] "When they were mixing it, we were sitting around and Bob Johnston came in and said, 'What {{do you want to}} call this?' And [...] just like said them out one at a time... Free association and silliness, I'm sure, played a big role." [...] Another Dylan chronicler, Oliver Trager, notes that besides spelling out the initials of Dylan's first name, the album title is also a riff on Brecht on Brecht, a stage production based on works by German playwright Bertolt Brecht that had influenced his early songwriting. Dylan himself has said of the title: [...] "Well, I don't even recall exactly how <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>up,</b> but I know it was all in good faith... I don't know who thought of that.

500|$|The episode {{uses the}} Extremis virus from Iron Man 3 as {{one source of}} power for the {{character}} of Mike Peterson.

[...] Additional sources of power for the character include: Chitauri technology, from The Avengers and Item 47; and super-soldier serum, from [...] and The Incredible Hulk. The events of The Avengers are referenced numerous times throughout the episode, and archive footage from the film is briefly used in an opening montage. Also, Coulson's flying car is a working model of the prototype seen in Captain America: The First Avenger.|$|E

On April 3, 1945, he appeared to present his arguments. Marshall's appeal made the case that no direct order was given to all 50 of the defendants to load munitions and that even if orders had been given to certain individuals, disobeying the orders could not constitute mutiny. He said that Coakley deliberately misled the court on the definition of [...] "mutiny" [...] and that the mass of evidence he introduced was hearsay, thus inadmissible. Marshall wrote that [...] "he accused were made scapegoats in a situation brought about by a combination of circumstances. [...] Justice can only be done in this case by a complete reversal of the findings." [...] Marshall said [...] "I can't understand why whenever more than one Negro disobeys an order it is mutiny." ...|$|E
500|$|Hannah was {{promoted}} to air marshal on 1January 1970, and succeeded Air Marshal Sir Alister Murdoch as Chief of the Air Staff. Murdoch had earlier recommended Hannah, {{known to be a}} strong advocate for Australian participation in the Vietnam War, for the position of Commander Australian Forces Vietnam when <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>up</b> for rotation at the end of 1969; the post went to an Army officer, and the Federal government ordered the withdrawal of the RAAF presence in Vietnam during Hannah's tour as CAS. In March 1970, the Minister for Defence, Malcolm Fraser, commissioned a review of naval air power. Hannah fundamentally disagreed with any suggestion that the Royal Australian Navy should operate land-based aircraft, claiming that he was arguing not from a partisan perspective but to ensure that Australia's limited defence resources were not spread across three services. Confidential RAAF papers from the time declared that its goal was always to [...] "avoid giving the Navy the opportunity to establish a land-based air force". Two years later, Hannah responded favourably to a recommendation from the Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, Admiral Sir Victor Smith, to use the soon-to-be-delivered F-111 bomber for maritime support, among other roles.|$|E
