5|$|A wasp is any insect of {{the order}} Hymenoptera and {{suborder}} Apocrita that <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> a bee nor an ant. The Apocrita have a common evolutionary ancestor and form a clade; wasps as a group do not form a clade, but are paraphyletic with respect to bees and ants.|$|E

5|$|A dwarf {{planet is}} a planetary-mass object that <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> a planet nor a natural satellite.

5|$|A {{metalloid}} is any {{chemical element}} which has properties in between those of metals and nonmetals, or {{that has a}} mixture of them.

Despite the lack of specificity, the term remains in use {{in the literature of}} chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Although Hurricane Vince {{developed}} {{in an unusual}} location in the northeastern Atlantic, well away from where tropical cyclones are usually found, it <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> the most northerly-forming nor the most easterly-forming Atlantic tropical storm; these records are held by Alberto of the 1988 season at 41.5°N, and Ginger of the 1967 season at 18.1°W, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Complex: These viruses {{possess a}} capsid that <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> purely helical nor purely icosahedral, {{and that may}} possess extra {{structures}} such as protein tails or a complex outer wall. Some bacteriophages, such as Enterobacteria phage T4, have a complex structure consisting of an icosahedral head bound to a helical tail, which may have a hexagonal base plate with protruding protein tail fibres. This tail structure acts like a molecular syringe, attaching to the bacterial host and then injecting the viral genome into the cell.|$|E

50|$|Vishnu {{appeared}} {{in the form of}} Narasimha - half human and half lion, at dusk (when it <b>was</b> <b>neither</b> day nor night), took Hiranyakashyapu at a doorstep (which <b>was</b> <b>neither</b> indoors nor outdoors), placed him on his lap (which <b>was</b> <b>neither</b> land, water nor air), and then eviscerated and killed the king with his lion claws (which <b>were</b> <b>neither</b> a handheld weapon nor a launched weapon). In this form, the boon of five special powers granted to Hiranyakashyapu were no longer useful. Prahlad and the kingdom of human beings were thus free from the compulsion and fear of Hiranyakashyapu, showing the victory of good over evil.|$|R

5|$|Even on a {{habitable}} {{planet with}} enough radioisotopes to heat its interior, various prebiotic molecules are required {{in order to}} produce life; therefore, the distribution of these molecules in the galaxy is important in determining the galactic habitable zone. A 2008 study by Samantha Blair and colleagues attempted to determine {{the outer edge of the}} galactic habitable zone by means of analyzing formaldehyde and carbon monoxide emissions from various giant molecular clouds scattered throughout the Milky Way; however, the data <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> conclusive nor complete.|$|E
5|$|Even though {{voices are}} often used, it <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> a concert opera nor a cantata, but a choral symphony. If there is singing, {{almost from the}} beginning, it is to prepare the listener's mind for the {{dramatic}} scenes whose feelings and passions are to be expressed by the orchestra. It is also to introduce the choral masses gradually into the musical development, when their too sudden appearance would have damaged the compositions's unity....|$|E

5|$|If any motion exists {{without a}} cause, then not every {{proposition}} will be either true or false. For {{that which has}} not efficient causes <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> true nor false. But every proposition is either true or false. Therefore, there is no motion without a cause. And if this is so, then all effects owe their existence to prior causes. And if this is so, all things happen by fate. It follows therefore that whatever happens, happens by fate.|$|E

5|$|Long, highly {{sensitive}} whiskers and front paws help the sea otter find prey by touch when waters are dark or murky. Researchers have noted when they approach in plain view, sea otters react more rapidly {{when the wind}} is blowing towards the animals, indicating the sense of smell is more important than sight as a warning sense. Other observations indicate the sea otter's sense of sight is useful above and below the water, although not as good as that of seals. Its hearing <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> particularly acute nor poor.|$|E

5|$|Phenomenalism is {{the theory}} that {{representations}} (or sense data) of external objects are all that exist. Such a view was briefly adopted by Bertrand Russell {{and many of the}} logical positivists during the early 20th century. A third possibility is to accept the existence of a basic substance that <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> physical nor mental. The mental and physical would then both be properties of this neutral substance. Such a position was adopted by Baruch Spinoza and was popularized by Ernst Mach in the 19th century. This neutral monism, as it is called, resembles property dualism.|$|E
5|$|Ragnarök is briefly {{referenced}} in stanza 40 of {{the poem}} Helgakviða Hundingsbana II. Here, the valkyrie Sigrún's unnamed maid is passing the deceased hero Helgi Hundingsbane's burial mound. Helgi is there with a retinue of men, surprising the maid. The maid asks if she is witnessing a delusion since she sees dead men riding, or if Ragnarök has occurred. In stanza 41, Helgi responds that it <b>is</b> <b>neither.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{cause of}} postmortem fetal {{extrusion}} {{is not completely}} understood, as the event <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> predictable nor replicable under experimental conditions. Evidence has accumulated opportunistically and direct observation is serendipitous. While {{it is possible that}} more than one cause can produce the same result, there is an accepted hypothesis, based on established research in the fields of biochemistry and forensic taphonomy, and further supported by observational research, that accounts for the taphonomic mechanisms that would result in the most often encountered cases of postmortem extrusion of a non-viable fetus.|$|E
5|$|Unlike our universe, {{which is}} now known to be {{expanding}} at an accelerating rate, anti-de Sitter space <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> expanding nor contracting. Instead it looks the same at all times. In more technical language, one says that anti-de Sitter space corresponds to a universe with a negative cosmological constant, whereas the real universe has a small positive cosmological constant.|$|E
5|$|Yates has {{cautioned that}} P. {{gracilis}} {{may be a}} metataxon, which means that there <b>is</b> <b>neither</b> evidence that the material assigned to it is monophyletic (belongs to one species), nor that it is paraphyletic (belongs to several species). This is the case because the holotype of P.(Sellosaurus) gracilis has no skull, and the other specimens consist of skulls and material that overlaps too little with the holotype to make it certain that {{it belongs to the}} same taxon. It is therefore possible that the known material contains more species belonging to Plateosaurus.|$|E
