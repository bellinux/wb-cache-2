This paper investigates the Holes Interaction Effect (HIE) and distribution effect on the sound absorption coefficient of microperforated panels when submitted to medium and high sound pressure levels (from 90 dB to 150 dB). It is experimentally demonstrated that though the HIE is mostly an added mass effect, the nonlinear resistance parameters depend on the separation distance between the holes. Analysis of the data shows that even with HIE, the nonlinear reactance dependency with velocity is very slight compared to the resistance-velocity-dependency. Microperforated panels of 2 mm thickness with varying pitches between holes were made and tested. Some classical models (based on Fok's functions) demonstrating holes interaction effects are compared to the experimental results performed with an impedance tube.

40|$|Most {{models for}} {{predicting}} the acoustic response of perforated panels {{are based on}} the assumption that there is no interaction between the holes. The common way of taking into account the perforates effects is the use of Fok's functions. The few papers that deal with these effects study the case of low sound pressure levels. This paper investigates the Holes Interaction Effects (HIE) of perforated and micro-perforated panels when submitted to high sound pressure levels. Analysis of the data yields to the fact that even with HIE, the nonlinear reactance dependency with velocity is very slight. The HIE can provide good absorption of the perforated panel backed by an air cavity at low and high sound pressure levels if the holes positions are well configured. Perforated panels of holes diameters less than 2 millimeters were built out of steel with different interstices (distance between two adjacent holes) and tested. Experimental results (performed with an impedance tube) in the cases of interaction are done and compared with the exact cases of no interactions. The results can be used for designing optimal perforated panels for <b>ducts</b> <b>silencers</b> for instance...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} the performance of bar-silencers in ventilation ducts, with and without mean flow. The goal of which was to determine a product which could be used on its own or in conjunction with current traditional methods for induct sound attenuation. A literature review was conducted on induct sound attenuation and bar-silencers. A test facility was established in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Canterbury. Modifications were made to an existing fan and duct rig to align it with ISO 7235 (1991) - Measurement procedures for <b>ducted</b> <b>silencers</b> - Insertion loss, flow noise and total pressure loss. A number of bar-silencers were tested in the test facility to determine both their insertion loss and pressure loss characteristics. Bar-silencers which varied in thickness, (such as, triangular shaped silencers) were confirmed to have an insertion loss across a greater range of frequencies, but lower peak absorption than ducting lined on two sides. It was found that the bar-silencers would not be a cost effective method of sound attenuation on their own, due to less effective noise absorption, higher material costs and higher pressure losses, than traditionally lined sections of ducting. However, the bar-silencers could be used in conjunction with traditional methods of sound attenuation to increase the attenuation or in low flow velocity ventilation exits where pressure losses are reduced...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} {{the application of}} a recently developed chart for determining the directional properties of sound emitted from the open end of a ventilation duct. When designing a <b>duct</b> <b>silencer</b> to reduce noise from a large vertical discharge duct, it is useful to note that the first 5 to 10 dBA noise reduction may result from directivity losses at 90 degrees and can be accurately predicted. In 1971 the first author conducted sound directivity tests with 300 and 600 mm diameter ducts and the results were made into a rough chart of Duct Directivity Losses that ultimately found its way into the NSW EPA Environmental Noise Control Manual (5 June 1985, page 207. 1). It is wrong in principle and rather inaccurate, but some users are unaware of its failings. Over the last 13 years further duct directivity testing has been conducted and a new duct directivity chart drawn. It is based on sound directivity testing on ducts of 305, 400, 610, 915 and 1220 mm diameter. The directivity data has been related to the sound power level of noise emitted from the duct and the spherical dispersion of sound energy. The new Duct Directivity Chart allows the directivity gain or loss to be obtained for any diameter from 100 mm to 10 metres, at angles from zero to 135 degrees without the need for complex calculations.

40|$|Central {{ventilation}} systems with heat recovery have shown their limits especially {{within the context}} of building energy retrofit. The difficulties to install these systems in existing buildings, to find available space for devices, air <b>ducts,</b> <b>silencers</b> and fire dampers and to independently control the air flow in each room according to the real ventilation needs have led to an increasing market for decentralized ventilation devices. A frequent criticism of decentralized devices is the poor ventilation effectiveness due to a high short-circuiting risk. Therefore, the University of Applied Sciences of Offenburg and the Frauhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems are evaluating together the inside air quality reached with decentralized {{ventilation systems}}. The tests described in this paper were performed in a test lab representing a single room were a decentralized ventilation system with heat recovery, heating and cooling functions was implemented. In a first part of the evaluation process, tests are realized to characterize the air distribution provided by the decentralized device by smoke visualization. The results are showing interesting differences between isothermal, heating and cooling cases. The characterization of air distribution in the volume of the room is not enough to evaluate the capacity of a ventilation system to provide a good inside air quality. Therefore, a second series of tests was performed with CO 2 as a tracer gas, enabling a more precise quantification of the ventilation effectiveness. The results show the CO 2 concentrations over time in zones with different air renewal levels for each of the 3 modes...|$|R
40|$|Today with rapid {{industrial}}ization, {{industrial noise}} {{has become a}} serious environmental problem in Sri Lanka. The noise which is generated by machines in industry is called as industrial noise. This excessive noise can interfere with communication between supervisors and employees. Continuous exposure to noise can cause fatigue, which often results in accidents and reduces the pace and quality of work. Noise affects negatively on the day today life of surrounding people, who have faced with many problems mentally and physically. Therefore, noise control {{is one of the}} major requirements to improve the living environment. Most of the developed countries use practical techniques to minimize the nuisance such as barrier walls, <b>duct</b> <b>silencers,</b> acoustical wall panel, soundproof curtains, sound enclosures for industrial machinery and other similar noise control treatments that are installed near the source to effectively reduce the sound level. However, Sri Lanka has not yet yielded much into this issue as noise reduction methods are costly. Therefore, it is necessary to find out cost effective methods to control industrial noise. This research was conducted to investigate the potential uses of Salvinia dust as natural sound reduction material, to give a solution for the existing industrial noise problems. Specimens having a size of 75 mm (diameter) x 25 mm (thickness) were made by using Salvinia dust. Salvinia dust was mixed with cement at a ratio of 1 : 1 and water was added. Noise Reduction Coefficient of these specimens were investigated by using an experimental set-up including signal generator, speaker and noise level meter. Noise reduction ability of the materials was quantified by using Noise Reduction Co-efficient (NRC). Variation of NRC with particle size, mix proportion and sample thickness were also investigated.

40|$|International audienceAn {{analytical}} model {{based on a}} homogenization process is used to predict and understand the behavior of finite length splitter/baffle-type silencers inserted axially into a rigid rectangular <b>duct.</b> Such <b>silencers</b> consist of a succession of parallel baffles made of porous material and airways inserted axially into a rigid duct. The pore network of the porous material in the baffle and the larger pores due to the airway {{can be considered as}} a double porosity (DP) medium with well-separated pore sizes. This scale separation leads by homogenization to the DP model, widely used in the porous material community. This alternative approach based on a homogenization process sheds physical insight into the attenuation mechanisms taking place in the silencer. Numerical comparisons with a reference method are used to show that the theory provides good results as long as the pressure wave in the silencer airways propagates as a plane wave parallel to the duct axis. The explicit expression of the axial wavenumber in the DP medium is used to derive an explicit expression for the optimal resistivity value of the porous material, ensuring the best dissipation for a given silencer geometry...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} and sound emission of a fan is {{strongly influenced by}} the installationeffect, which {{can be defined as}} the difference between the performance of a fan in ainstallation and the ideal configuration of the same fan. The factors that one should keepin mind while designing a fan system are many, but if some ground rules are followed thenoise can be drastically reduced. The choice of location for the equipment in the buildingis a critical decision and a less ideal location can result in expensive reconstructions and,or that spaces around the fan room can not be used for its initial purpose. A large fan withlower rotation speed will have lower sound emissions then a smaller fan with a higherrotation speed, for the same air flow. The sound and vibration emissions, as well as theenergy consumption of the fan will be at its lowest values when it is at its point ofmaximum efficiency. The outlet configuration of the duct from the fan should be straightand without dampers or <b>ducts</b> <b>silencers</b> that can create turbulence or a higher staticpressure close to the fan, which will decrease the fans performance drastically. The vibration isolation of the fan should be created and specified for the specificinstallation and not solely the fan characteristics. Proposals to predict and measure thestructure-borne sound pressure and transmissions in buildings have recently beenreleased. With a standard over the structure borne sound, the manufactures can declarethe source data for the fans under different operations. This brings that more accuratepredictions and calculations of the structure borne sound from installations can be done. Earlier calculation methods show big deviances between measured and calculated soundpressure in several cases. Above all the spread of the results is large, which makes themethod somewhat unreliable when sound rating spaces, regarding fan room noise. Calculations and predictions of the sound pressure in a fan room can, after proposals ofchange, be done with a deviation of  10 dBfor all frequencies between 63 and 4000 Hz. The method shows a tendency to overrate the sound pressure with a relatively smallspread of the results. It also shows signs to be able to predict the sound pressure in fanrooms with smaller fans then big fan units. Calculations of the increase of sound pressure that occur in the cavity between the floorstructure and the fan unit show big deviations it if is done for specific frequencies.

40|$|The Heat Ventilation Air Conditioning System (HVAC) {{is one of}} the ducting {{systems that}} are {{commonly}} found to make occupants in the building comfortable by controlling the temperature and air flow. However, noise is produced in the system and reaches the occupants inside the building, thus causing distraction, discomfort and uneasiness. There are HVAC silencers in the market, however the typical sound absorbing material used is mineral wool types. This research focuses on the <b>ducting</b> <b>silencer</b> with the sound absorbing material that made from Coconut fiber, Arenga Pinnata (Ijuk), Kenaf, Cotton and Rockwool. The compositions of these materials have been tested to identify its performance. The objective of this research is to compare the insertion loss in the HVAC by using various configurations. The materials have been tested separately at various frequencies {{to determine the effects of}} the forward airflow in the HVAC system in the transmission loss and to analyse the affect of the insertion loss on the straight and bend in the HVAC duct system. The experiment that was carried out follows the standard ASTM E 477. In this experiment, the sound absorbing material of Coconut fiber with different configuration has been investigated, followed by other types of sound absorptive materials such as Arenga Pinnata (Ijuk), Kenaf, Cotton and Rockwool. From the overall result and comparison, all the materials that tested on straight and bend ducting showed the same performance trends where at below frequency of 500 Hz the insertion loss was high at certain frequency only. The insertion loss increases steadily from 500 Hz until 6300 Hz and maintained until frequency 10000 Hz at around 6 dB to 40 dB. The insertion loss increase as the numbers of sound absorptive materials in the silencer increase but the 4 pieces configuration has been chosen as the best configuration because the air flow was higher around 60 % compared to configuration of 5 pieces. The insertion loss of 30 g Rockwool combined with 30 g Cotton was higher compared to other materials which are averagely 44. 8 % higher than Rockwool alone, 44. 1 % higher than Cotton alone, 35 % higher than Kenaf alone, 81. 4 % higher than combination of Arenga Pinnata and Kenaf, 65. 1 % higher than Coconut fiber alone, and 118. 9 % higher than Arenga Pinnata alone.

40|$|In {{many kinds}} of buildings, the {{ventilation}} is handled by a mechanical ventilation system. Such ventilation systems constitute a well known source of broadband noise. As awareness of the negative effects that subjection to low frequency noise can have on human well-being has increased, so too has the requirement for quieter ventilation installations. Traditionally, duct born noise is attenuated using passive resistive silencers. These passive silencers are valued {{for their ability to}} produce a high level of attenuation over a broad frequency range, however they tend to become large and bulky if designed for low frequency attenuation. The active noise control (ANC) technique is known for its ability to produce high levels of attenuation in the low frequency range even with a relatively moderate sized ANC system. On the other hand, ANC normally tends to be ineffective for higher frequencies. Accordingly, a combination of active- and passive techniques, i. e. the construction of a hybrid active/passive <b>silencer,</b> provides a <b>duct</b> <b>silencer</b> solution of manageable size which also covers the low frequency range. The ANC systems controller normally relies on adaptive digital signal processing. Even so, adequate levels of attenuation {{are not likely to be}} obtained if the installation of the ANC system is not designed to account for the physical factors that may degrade its performance. This thesis focuses on applying ANC in ventilation systems, with particular emphasis on analysis and installation design, for the purpose of reducing the influence of some of these degrading physical factors. The degrading factors which are of particular interest include: flow induced noise in the microphone signals, acoustic feedback between the control loudspeaker and reference microphone, and standing waves inside the ducts. With respect to installation design, focus is also placed upon industry requests on the ANC system. Taking this into consideration has led to a module based approach, in which the microphones and the loudspeaker are installed in separate modules based on standard duct parts. This thesis comprises four parts. The first describes initial investigations of potential microphone installations intended to reduce flow induced noise. The second part analyzes the influence of flow induced noise on the digital controller and presents further investigations of microphone modules. Further, results of measurements conducted in an acoustic laboratory according to an ISO-standard are presented. The attenuation produced by the ANC system was approximately 15 - 25 dB between 50 - 315 Hz even for airflow speeds up to 20 m/s. The third part of this thesis focuses on the possibility of using the passive silencer with which the ANC system is combined, to reduce acoustic feedback and standing waves. The fourth and final part investigates the possibility of using a passive silencer to reduce standing waves in the duct when the ANC system is not installed near the duct outlet...|$|R
40|$|Today {{mechanical}} ventilation systems are installed in many buildings {{to handle the}} ventilation. Such ventilation systems constitute a potential source of unwanted background noise in the buildings. In {{order to reduce the}} noise propagating through the <b>ducts</b> passive <b>silencers</b> are normally installed {{as a part of the}} ventilation system. However, the passive silencers are relatively ineffective in the low frequency range. A solution can be to use a combination of active noise control (ANC) and passive techniques where the ANC system extends the noise attenuation to include the low frequency noise. The construction of the ventilation systems can vary substantially between different buildings and may contain many different duct parts in different compositions etc. Hence, it may not be trivial to find a cost- and performance efficient installation of an ANC system in a ventilation system, e. g. to find a proper installation position of it and suitable passive silencers to combine it with, finding out if one or several ANC systems should be used, and so on. In order to make the design of a complete ventilation system (including one or several ANC systems) cost- and time efficient, an adequate mathematical model of the duct is required. The purpose of the model is to describe sound propagation in the duct. Such model can be built e. g. based on the two-port theory or by finite element method. In this paper initial investigations concerning modelling of standard duct parts were performed. Simulations were carried out to find parameters such as Noise Reduction etc., using both plane wave two-port theory and finite element modelling. The results of the simulations were compared with measurement results...|$|R
40|$|Heating, {{ventilating}} and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems {{represent a}} major source of inside buildings noise with a negative effect on the acoustical environment. Therefore, it is necessary to add attenuation to the system. This is provided by sound attenuators or silencers manufactured in different geometrical configurations and with various absorptive lining materials. The paper deals with the insertion loss, as a performance criterion for in-duct noise, of some dissipative silencers types. The measured data are compared in order to establish the efficiency of every tested silencer type. Third-octave band analysis of random noise of an air handling unit (AHU) from a HVAC system is realized without and with <b>silencers</b> (<b>ducts</b> fitted).

40|$|Sound {{generation}} and propagation in circular ducts for frequencies beyond the cut-on frequencies of several higher order acoustic modes is investigated. To achieve this, experimental and numerical set-ups are designed {{and used to}} research aeroacoustic interactions between in-duct components and to conceive noise mitigation strategies. Describing in-duct sound for frequencies with a moderate number of propagating modes is important, for example, for improving the noise emission from mid-size ventilation systems. Challenges that are largely unacknowledged in the literature involve efficient test rig design, quantification of limits in the methods, numerical modelling, and development of effective noise mitigation strategies for higher order modes. In this thesis, in-duct sound is mapped {{on a set of}} propagating pressure eigenmodes to describe aeroacoustic components as multi-ports with sound scattering (passive properties) and a source strength (active properties). The presented analysis includes genetic algorithms and Monte Carlo Methods for test rig enhancement and evaluation, multi-port network predictions to identify model limitations, and scale resolving (IDDES) and Linearized Navier Stokes computations for numerical multi-port eduction and the silencer design. It is first shown that test rig optimization improves the quality of multi-port data significantly. Subsequently, measurements on orifice plates are used to test the network prediction model. The model works with high accuracy for two components that are sufficiently separated. For small separations, strong coupling effects are observed for the source strength but not for the scattering of sound. The measurements are used for numerical validation, which gives reliable results for coupled and uncoupled systems. The total acoustic power of tandem orifices is predicted with less than 2 dB deviation and the passive properties for most frequencies with less than 5 % difference from the measurement. The numerical (FEM) models are also used to design a completely integrated silencer for spinning modes that is based on micro-perforated plates and gives broadband attenuation of 3 - 6 dB per <b>duct</b> diameter <b>silencer</b> length. The multi-port method is a powerful tool when describing aerodynamically decoupled in-duct components in the low- to mid-frequency range. Due to a robust passive network prediction, multi-port methods are particular interesting for the design of silencer stages. Furthermore, the demonstrated applicability to numerical data opens novel application areas. QC 20170522 IdealVen...|$|R

Their in-depth analyses {{are essential for}} the development of advanced noise control solutions. In this thesis, a package of efficient numerical modeling tools is developed based on the sub-structuring approach, {{in order to deal with}} complex structural-acoustical couplings among various subsystem components in a wide range of applications. A Compound Interface-Patch Transfer Function (CI-PTF) approach is proposed, highlighting its ability in handling mixed separations, such as those composed of rigid or flexible structures and apertures. Typical structural and acoustical subsystems are characterized as a few versatile subsystem modules, serving as the building blocks for constructing complex system configurations. The convergence, accuracy, and efficiency of the developed numerical tools are thoroughly validated. As an important non-fibrous sound absorbing material, micro-perforated panels (MPPs) and their in-situ sound absorption in coupled vibroacoustic systems are investigated. The MPP is modeled as an integral component of the system using the proposed CI-PTF approach. Numerical studies show that the actual sound absorption performance of the MPPs strongly depends on the surrounding environment, which unequivocally demonstrates that MPP cannot be simply considered as a locally reactive element in a complex vibroacoustic environment. For sound transmission control inside a <b>duct,</b> acoustic <b>silencers</b> are considered whose modeling is systematically tackled by the proposed numerical tools. Reactive silencers with rigid internal partitions are studied for their parametric influences and noise attenuation mechanisms. With the introduction of MPPs as dissipative elements, a unit cell treatment is proposed to model the complex side-branch configuration, and investigations reveal the hybrid attenuation mechanism of such device, which combines the reflection and absorption effects. Benefiting from the modular nature of the sub-structuring approach, the size of the perforated hole and the perforation ratio can be optimized to strike a balance between the dissipative and reactive effect, for ultimately achieving a desired Transmission Loss (TL) within a prescribed frequency range. The calculation accuracy for both reactive and hybrid MPP silencers using the proposed approach have been confirmed with finite element method (FEM) simulations and experiments. For the tuning and optimization of a silencer, the broadband TL performance realized by a number of cascade-connected sub-chambers is investigated. A theoretical basis for the description of the overall system TL is presented. The characteristics of the sub-chambers, along with the understandings of influences of the parameters, provide guidelines for their optimizations, and a desired broadband performance is achieved by connecting sub-chambers with optimized TLs to tackle different frequency regions. Based on the sub-chamber strategy, a multi-level approach for the design, analysis and optimization of acoustic silencers with cascaded sub-chambers is proposed. Through numerical case studies and a retrofitted design of a mining truck muffler, the effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated, which greatly reduces the design variables and computational costs compared with global design and optimization.
