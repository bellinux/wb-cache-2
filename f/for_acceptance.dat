5|$|After the trial, Manoj and Babli, {{accompanied}} {{by a team of}} five police officers assigned to them for protection, left for Chandigarh. The police left them at Pipli and slipped away. Suspecting foul play, Manoj and Babli did not continue toward Chandigarh, instead boarding a bus for Karnal. According to a statement filed by Chanderpati, later that day, around 3:40pm, she received a call from a Pipli telephone booth from Manoj, who said that the police had deserted them, and Babli's family members were trailing them, so they would try to take a bus to Delhi and call her back later. Babli asked <b>for</b> <b>acceptance</b> from Chanderpati, who replied affirmatively. That was the last time Manoj's family heard from the couple.|$|E
5|$|Chetham's educates {{students}} {{between the}} ages of 8 and 18, all of whom enter the School via musical audition only. Students receive a full academic education following the UK National Curriculum, alongside specialist group and individual music tuition. Although there is no academic criteria <b>for</b> <b>acceptance,</b> the school regularly obtains good exam results in both music and academic subjects. Almost all western instruments may be studied, including singing in the Sixth Form only or as a chorister at Manchester Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} run, the Navy {{decided to move}} the Chance Vought factory from Stratford, Connecticut to a much larger facility in Dallas, Texas which had been vacant {{since the end of}} World War II; this badly disrupted {{the production}} of the Pirate. The airframes were built in Stratford and trucked to Dallas where government-furnished equipment, such as the engines and afterburners, were installed. The completed aircraft were then taxied around the new plant's airfield, but the runway was deemed too short to handle jets. The aircraft had to be disassembled and trucked to an abandoned airfield at Ardmore, Oklahoma with a runway long enough <b>for</b> <b>acceptance</b> testing.|$|E

5|$|North of this station, two {{additional}} tracks are {{located within the}} right-of-way. One of the tracks is used to allow for Rockaway Park Shuttle trains to relay and {{to go back into}} service to the Rockaways, while the other track is called the Far Rockaway Test Track. The latter of the two tracks is used to test new subway cars {{to make sure that they}} are ready <b>for</b> <b>acceptance</b> into New York City Transit's fleet of subway cars.|$|E
5|$|Each town in {{the colony}} was {{considered}} a single church congregation; in later years, {{some of the larger}} towns split into two or three congregations. Church attendance was mandatory for all residents of the colony, while church membership was restricted to those who had converted to the faith. In Plymouth Colony, it seems that a simple profession of faith was all that was required <b>for</b> <b>acceptance.</b> This was a more liberal doctrine than some other New England congregations, such as those of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, where it was common to subject those seeking formal membership to strict and detailed cross-examinations. There was no central governing body for the churches. Each individual congregation was left to determine its own standards of membership, hire its own ministers, and conduct its own business.|$|E
5|$|The Vance {{plan was}} {{designed}} to stop fighting in Croatia and allow negotiations to proceed without the impact of ongoing hostilities. It offered no political solutions in advance. The plan entailed the deployment of the 10,000-strong United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) to the three major conflict areas designated as UN Protected Areas (UNPAs). The plan listed specific municipalities that were {{to be included in}} each UNPA, but the exact borders of each UNPA were not defined clearly because several municipalities were only to be partially included. The task of defining the exact borders of each UNPA was delegated to the UN liaison officers deployed in advance, in co-operation with authorities in each area. Creation of the UNPAs was necessary <b>for</b> <b>acceptance</b> of the plan by Milošević and Tuđman. The Serb-dominated authorities of Yugoslavia originally requested the deployment of a UN force along a zone between Serb and Croatian areas, reflecting the Serb desire to see the peacekeeping force securing the confrontation lines. Croatia wanted the UN force deployed along its international borders. The UNPAs served to formally satisfy both parties.|$|E

5|$|Vincent Clarkson, {{also known}} by the alter ego Valerie Davis, is a fictional {{character}} from the American soap opera Passions, which aired on NBC from 1999 to 2007 and on DirecTV in 2007–08. Created by the soap's founder and head writer James E. Reilly, Vincent was portrayed by Phillip Jeanmarie from 2006–2008. Valerie was played by Daphnée Duplaix from 2004–2008, and temporarily by Siena Goines in 2007. Jeanmarie originally auditioned {{for the role of}} a peeping tom before the role was expanded as the show progressed. Jeanmarie and Duplaix were both unaware that Vincent and Valerie were the same character until receiving the script and shooting the scenes. Jeanmarie approached playing Vincent through his abuse as a child by his grandfather Alistair Crane, interpreting him as a character constantly searching <b>for</b> <b>acceptance.</b> The character received a more uncertain response from the show's other cast members.|$|E
5|$|With {{the opening}} of the Platine rivers, Paraguay now found it {{possible}} to contract with European technicians and Brazilian specialists to aid in its development. Unhindered access to the outside world also enabled it to import more advanced military technology. During the greater part of the 1850s, the dictator Carlos López harassed Brazilian vessels attempting to freely navigate the Paraguay River. López feared that the province of Mato Grosso might become a base from which an invasion from Brazil could be launched. This dispute was also leverage with the Imperial government <b>for</b> <b>acceptance</b> of his territorial demands in the region. The nation also experienced difficulties in delimiting its borders with Argentina which wanted the whole Gran Chaco region: a demand which Paraguay could not accept, as this would entail surrendering more than half of its national territory.|$|E
