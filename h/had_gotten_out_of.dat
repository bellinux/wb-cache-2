However, Xenix was never sold to end users directly although it was licensed to many software OEMs for resale. It grew to become the most popular version of Unix, measured by the number of machines running it (note that Unix is a multi-user operating system, allowing simultaneous access to a machine by several users). By the mid-1980s Microsoft <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Unix business, except for an interest in SCO.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1970s, Ike Turner's {{excessive}} cocaine habit <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hand. During this period, Tina {{adopted the}} Nichiren Buddhism faith and chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo {{to help her}} deal with a stressful marriage and career. Due to Ike Turner's drug abuse, some shows were either canceled or postponed. In July 1976, Ike Turner had plans to leave United Artists Records for a five-year, $150,000 deal with Cream Records. The deal was to be signed on July 6. On July 1, 1976, Ike and Tina were en route from Los Angeles to Dallas where the Revue had a gig at the Dallas Statler Hilton. Ike and Tina {{got into a fight}} during their ride to the hotel. Shortly after arriving to the hotel, Tina fled from the hotel and later hid at a friend's house. On July 27, Tina sued for divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences.Ike claims in his book that Tina initiated the fight by purposely irritating him so that she'd have a reason to break up with him before they were scheduled to sign a new 5-year contract upon their return from Dallas.|$|E
25|$|Ribault made at {{once for}} St. Augustine with two hundred sailors and four hundred soldiers, which {{included}} the best men of the garrison at Fort Caroline. At dawn {{the next day he}} came upon Men√©ndez in the very act of attempting to pass the bar and to land a sloop and two boats filled with men and artillery from the San Salvador which had sailed at midnight with the San Pelayo. The tide was out and his boats so loaded that only by great skill was he able to cross it with his sloop, and escape; for the French, who had at once attempted to prevent his landing and thus to capture his cannon and the supplies he had on board, got so close to him, that they hailed him, and summoned him to surrender, promising that no harm should befall him. As soon as Ribault perceived that the boats <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his reach, he gave up the attempt and started in pursuit of the San Salvador, which was already six or eight leagues away.|$|E

25|$|Hawkeye remains {{with the}} Avengers for {{numerous}} adventures. He aids Avenger trainees Justice and Firestar {{to defeat the}} Taskmaster and Albino. Hawkeye later resigns the Avengers to assume leadership {{of the first generation}} of the Thunderbolts, who had broken away from the influence of Baron Helmut Zemo. Hawkeye trains the team in the fashion of former teammate Captain America, and shapes the team into a cohesive fighting unit. The Thunderbolts take on threats like the Masters of Evil, Graviton, and the Scourge of the Underworld. Hawkeye begins a romantic relationship with fellow Thunderbolts member Moonstone, who Hawkeye is proving to be a good influence on. Later, Hawkeye and the Thunderbolts travel to Hell to save the soul of Mockingbird. They defeat the demonic Mephisto, but Hawkeye is unable to find his wife. To ensure that his Thunderbolts are given full pardons, Hawkeye allows himself to be arrested in their place. The Thunderbolts' past crimes are erased on the condition that they retire from costumed heroics. The team reluctantly agrees. Later, when Hawkeye <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> prison, the team comes back together to defeat Graviton once again. Convinced that they are ready to be heroes in their own right, Hawkeye hands leadership of the Thunderbolts to Citizen V (whose mind was actually under the control of Baron Helmut Zemo) and leaves the team.|$|E

During the shooting of an underwater sequence, a few electrical lights were used. The electricians changed the lines, creating a short circuit which resulted in the death of one of the unit members.

[...] Max soon however has misgivings about his friend's new enthusiasms, having heard from eyewitnesses who <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Berlin that Jews were being beaten and their businesses boycotted. Martin responds, telling Max that, while they may be good friends, everybody knows that Jews have been the universal scapegoats, and [...] "a few must suffer for the millions to be saved." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Marvel Editor-In-Chief Joe Quesada, the [...] "Decimation" [...] {{event was}} {{designed}} {{to reduce the number}} of mutant characters in the Marvel Universe, which he felt <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hand after forty years of publishing. Most criticisms by fans have been aimed at inconsistencies regarding the roster of mutants who retained their powers after the event. For example, in the Generation M mini-series, several characters were considered depowered, even though they retained their physical mutations. The Civil War Files one-shot revealed that the US government's assessment of the number of mutants on Earth may not be accurate, which allowed Marvel to change the number of depowered mutants. Additionally, characters such as Namor and the Great Lakes Avengers, who are described as mutants but not particularly tied to the X-Men series of books, have not been affected by the event.|$|E

2500|$|While Karen was {{suffering}} from the anorexia nervosa that would ultimately kill her in 1983, in the late 1970s, Richard suffered from insomnia, panic attacks, depression, and an addiction to Quaalude, a sedative and hypnotic medication. Author James Gavin noted in his New York Times review of Randy L. Schmidt's biography Little Girl Blue: The Life of Karen Carpenter (2010): [...] "His mother {{is said to have}} given him his first pill," [...] an observation that was previously portrayed in the CBS-TV [...] television film The Karen Carpenter Story (1989) and commented on in several of that made-for-TV movie's reviews, which also noted that Agnes (their mother) had been taking them under prescription and thus thought they were safe. At the time he sought help, Carpenter had a doctor's prescription for Quaalude as sleep aid, but his use <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> hand.|$|E

60|$|Master Lord {{refused to}} answer, and I asked myself if Hiram {{could be so}} venturesome as to think it {{possible}} we might carry these two Tories <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the town.

A dark, glancing ripple wavered over the water; there was just enough swell to make seeing fish easy.|$|E

Later I went to Takahashi and asked to examine his jaw, fearing {{it might have been}} broken. This fear of mine, however, was unfounded. Moreover the Jap had recovered from his pain and anger. [...] "More better now," [...] he said, with a grin. [...] "Maybe my fault anyhow." ...|$|E
60|$|The threshing-machine burned like a {{house of}} cards. Farm-hands came running {{from all over the}} field. But nothing, manifestly, could be done to save the thresher. Anderson, holding his daughter's arm, calmly watched it burn. There was {{excitement}} all around; it had not been communicated, however, to the rancher. He looked thoughtful. The foreman darted among the groups of watchers and his distress was very plain. Dorn <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight. Lenore still held his coat and wondered what he was doing. She was thoroughly angry and marveled at her father's composure. The big thresher was reduced to a blazing, smoking hulk in short order.|$|E
