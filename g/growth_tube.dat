Detection efficiency was investigated ex-perimentally using different temperatures of the saturator and of the <b>growth</b> <b>tube.</b> The experiments showed that detection efficiency can be improved by increasing {{the temperature of the}} <b>growth</b> <b>tube</b> and decreasing the saturator temperature. Fitting a two-free parameter equation to the experimental data, the cut-sizes D 50 % were determined. The determined cut-sizes were comparable with the other three widely used fitting equations. The cut-sizes were studied by changing the <b>growth</b> <b>tube</b> temperature from 40 to 65  °C and varying the saturator temperature from 10 to 30  °C. For the purpose of the study, the instrument operation regime (saturator and <b>growth</b> <b>tube</b> temperatures) can be optimised by selecting the needed cut-size. The cut-sizes can be changed in a wide range. The smallest detected cut-size D 50 % was 4. 2  nm, and the largest 14. 6  nm. In the default operation regime, the instrument cut-size was 5. 9  nm. The detection efficiency of the studied TSI CPC  3785 was compared with the ultrafine TSI CPC  3786. The results showed that the studied CPC can be optimised to the regime having a smaller cut-size than the cut-size of the ultrafine CPC in the default regime.

Objectives: To determine if PPHN alters fetal pulmonary artery endothelial cell (PAEC) phenotype and impairs growth and angiogenesis in vitro, and if altered vascular endothelial growth factor– nitric oxide (VEGF–NO) signaling contributes to this abnormal phenotype. Methods: Proximal PAECs were harvested from fetal sheep that had undergone partial ligation of the ductus arteriosus in utero (PPHN) and age-matched control animals. <b>Growth</b> and <b>tube</b> formation 6 VEGF and NO stimulation and inhibition were studied in normal and PPHN PAECs. Western blot {{analysis was performed}} for VEGF, VEGF receptor- 2 (VEGF-R 2), and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) protein content.

VEGF and eNOS protein expression were decreased in PPHN PAECs, whereas VEGF-R 2 protein expression was not different. VEGF and NO increased PPHN PAEC <b>growth</b> and <b>tube</b> formation to values achieved in normal PAECs. VEGF inhibition decreased <b>growth</b> and <b>tube</b> formation in normal and PPHN PAECs.

Conclusions: PPHN in utero causes sustained impairment of PAEC phenotype in vitro, with reduced PAEC <b>growth</b> and <b>tube</b> formation and down-regulation of VEGF and eNOS protein.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{primarily}} concerned {{with the growth of}} bulk cadmium telluride (CdTe) crystals. The work relates to a modified physical vapour transport system which also enables the growth of ternary ll-VI compounds, in particular cadmium zinc telluride (CdZnTe). A computer simulation to model the CdTe growth process is developed, along with a system to measure the partial pressures in situ during growth. The modified Multi Tube Physical Vapour Transport (MTPVT) system, which is essentially a combination of the Markov annulus and Rosenberger flow restrictor designs, consists of two source tubes and a <b>growth</b> <b>tube</b> connected by a crossmember. This crossmember, which is optically heated, contains two capillaries which act as flow restrictors, and allows physical displacement, and therefore better thermal decoupling, of the source and growth areas. The growth of CdTe in the MTPVT system is investigated, in particular, factors affecting the optimal design for the <b>growth</b> <b>tube.</b> The design of the pedestal, on which the seed crystal is located, is of prime importance in preventing polycrystalline growth, and {{the size and shape of}} the seed crystal is also critical. Increasing the inner diameter of the <b>growth</b> <b>tube</b> from 32 mm to 52 mm reduces the effect of the annulus gap around the seed, and increases the controllability of the growth process. A computer simulation is used to model the vapour flow from the subliming source, through the capillary, and to the growing crystal and down the annulus. The trends predicted closely match those obtained experimentally, and imply, as expected, the growth process is controlled by the mass transport rate through the capillary. Further comparison with experiment gives an upper limit of 0. 45 eV for the activation energy of the incorporation of atoms into the CdTe seed, although no lower limit can be set. The partial pressure - optical density relationships are derived for Cd(_g), Zn(_g) and Te 2 (_g), with the 214 nm absorption line of Zn(_g) observed to deviate significantly from Beer’s Law. Optical monitoring during CdTe growth by a computer controlled optical absorption measurement system allows in situ monitoring of the partial pressures. The measurements of the source side partial pressures match those predicted by the computer simulation, with the partial pressure ratio of around 1. 7 also consistent with the model...|$|E

40|$|That sexual {{selection}} {{can be an}} active force in plant evolution is still under debate. When the number of pollen grains deposited onto a stigma exceeds the number of available ovules, competition among pollen grains for fertilizations will result in selection on traits that increase siring ability (e. g. pollen <b>tube</b> <b>growth</b> rate). The pistil {{can be regarded as}} an arena for pollen competition, where pistil size and shape have the potential to intensify competition and thereby increase the possibility of sorting among pollen donors. Pollen <b>tube</b> <b>growth</b> rate can function as a cue for female choice if there is a positive relationship between pollen <b>tube</b> <b>growth</b> rate and sporophytic quality of individual donors when this quality is reflected in the offspring.

In two-donor crosses, pollen <b>tube</b> <b>growth</b> rate had a strong influence on siring ability, which, in turn, was positively related to offspring seed production.

40|$|This thesis covers {{some of the}} {{development}} of a novel vapour growth system for the production of large, high quality crystals of cadmium telluride, focusing in particular on ampoule development, flow calibration, and mass transport studies. The Multi Tube Physical Vapour Transport system is an evolution of the Markov design, the unique feature being a U-Tube ampoule configuration which allows direct viewing of the crystal surface, and in-situ, non invasive vapour pressure monitoring. The system incorporates a capillary flow restrictor between source material and the growing crystal which allows the mass transport rate to be controlled almost independently of crystal temperature. The <b>growth</b> <b>tube</b> section of the ampoule has been modified to allow hardened platinum wires of well defined diameter to be inserted between the crystal holder (a conical plug with polished upper surface which fits into a ground glass socket in the <b>growth</b> <b>tube)</b> and ampoule wall, allowing the aimulus gap to be defined by the thickness of the wire. A shielding system for the vapour pressure monitoring system has been developed and tested which prevents cadmium or cadmium telluride (which has escaped from the growth ampoule via non perfect ground glass joints) from condensing on the sapphire windows of the outer vacuum jacket. The capillary flow restrictor has been calibrated for viscous, molecular and mixed flow regimes using several test gasses. This information has been used to model the mass transport of CdTe in 3 growth runs of the MTPVT system by integrating viscous and molecular flow rates with respect to time. The mass of CdTe transported from source to crystal during each run selected for study was in good agreement with the mass transport of CdTe predicted by the flow model...|$|E

Experimental investigations of vapor phase binary nucleation {{were carried out}} for both the methanesulfonic acid-water and the sulfuric acid-water systems. A rapid mixing device produced acid-water aerosols under isothermal conditions and at relative acidities (Ra), 0. 04 < Ra < 0. 65, relative humidities (Rh), 0. 01 < Rh < 0. 65, and temperatures, T = 20, 25 and 30 °C. The number concentration of the aerosol at the exit of the nucleation and <b>growth</b> <b>tube</b> is extremely sensitive to the binary nucleation rate. Thus at low particle concentrations, when condensation did not significantly change the saturation levels the binary nucleation rates were estimated from the number concentration data {{as a function of}} Ra, Rh and temperature. Particle size distributions were also measured and found to vary with the amount of acid and water present. An integral model considering both nucleation and growth simulated the experimental system and predicted the total number of particles, the total mass in the aerosol phase, and the mass average diameter at the exit of the nucleation and <b>growth</b> <b>tube.</b> The simulations reproduced the experimental results quite well for the methansulfonic acid-water binary, if the nucleation rate was adjusted by a temperature dependent correction factor which ranged from [ [...] . ] to [ [...] . ].

Classical homogeneous nucleation theory was extended to nonisothermal conditions by simultaneously solving cluster mass and energy balances. In vapor phase nucleation, the steady state nucleation rate was lower than the corresponding isothermal rate and this discrepancy increased as the pressure of the background gas decreased.

40|$|The Sequential Spot Sampler (S 3), a newly {{developed}} instrument to collect aerosols for time-resolved chemical composition measurements, was evaluated {{in the laboratory}} and field for the measurement of particulate sulfate and nitrate.

The well plate, as received from the field, is placed onto a needle-based autosampler that adds liquid for sample extraction and injects sample extract from each well onto an ion chromatograph for analysis. Laboratory evaluation for sulfate and nitrate ions showed that poly ether ether ketone (PEEK) used as well plate material does not contribute any artifacts; a 60 min extraction procedure leads to the recovery of sulfate and nitrate from the dry spots at above 95 % extraction efficiency; and samples stored frozen and analyzed up to 23  months later show less than a 10 % change in sulfate and nitrate concentrations. The limit of detection was 0. 5 µg m − 3 for sulfate and 0. 2 µg m − 3 for nitrate for a 1 h sampling period.

The effect of the inlet line pressure on the measured particle concentration was measured, and two separate regions inside the A 10, where supersaturation of working fluid can take place, were identified. The possibility of varying the lower cut-off diameter of the nCNC was investigated; by scanning the <b>growth</b> <b>tube</b> temperature, the range of the lower cut-off was extended from 1 – 2. 5 to 1 – 6  nm. Here we present a new inlet system, which allows automated measurement of the background concentration of homogeneously nucleated droplets, minimizes the diffusion losses in the sampling line and is equipped with an electrostatic filter to remove ions smaller than approximately 4. 5  nm.  Finally, our view of the guidelines for the optimal use of the Airmodus nCNC is provided...|$|E
40|$|The {{nematode}} Caenorhabditis elegans {{is one of}} {{the premier}} experimental model organisms today. In the laboratory, they display characteristic development, fertility, and behaviors in a two dimensional habitat. In nature, however, C. elegans is found in three dimensional environments such as rotting fruit. To investigate the biology of C. elegans in a 3 D controlled environment we designed a nematode cultivation habitat which we term the nematode <b>growth</b> <b>tube</b> or NGT- 3 D. NGT- 3 D allows for the growth of both nematodes and the bacteria they consume. Worms show comparable rates of growth, reproduction and lifespan when bacterial colonies in the 3 D matrix are abundant. However, when bacteria are sparse, growth and brood size fail to reach levels observed in standard 2 D plates. Using NGT- 3 D we observe drastic deficits in fertility in a sensory mutant in 3 D compared to 2 D, and this defect was likely due to an inability to locate bacteria. Overall, NGT- 3 D will sharpen our understanding of nematode biology and allow scientists to investigate questions of nematode ecology and evolutionary fitness in the laboratory...|$|E
40|$|It is {{now well}} {{established}} that the emission of sub-micrometric particulate matter entrained in flue gases of industry and vehicles exhausts, {{is one of the}} most critical treats for human health because of the toxicological effects of ultrafine particles on the respiratory system and their ability to cross alveoli’s membranes reaching the circulatory system too. Albeit this scenario, the traditional particle abatement devices are mainly designed and optimised to treat particles larger than 1 μm, but they are far less effective towards the sub-micrometric particles. In particular, the existing technologies are far less efficient in collecting sub-micrometric particles, especially in the range 0. 1 - 1 μm, called Greenfield gap. The aim of this work is the study of the heterogeneous condensation, a promising method that can be used to achieve very high particles removal efficiency with reduced costs: particles undergoing heterogeneous condensation increase their diameter by deposition of a liquid film on the particles surface, generating a liquid-solid aerosol with desired diameter. Therefore, this process can be used as a preconditioning technique to enlarge the particles diameter at micrometric size, allowing the use of conventional separators for gas cleaning. Although largely studied for its effect on atmospheric phenomena and for the application to particle measurement techniques (the CPC units), heterogeneous condensation has never been used at industrial scale as a method for gas cleaning. In this study, theoretical and experimental analyses on the heterogeneous condensation have been carried out. For this purpose instrumented lab scale equipment has been designed, constructed and tested. Experimental protocols and measurement techniques have been optimized. The core of the equipment is the <b>growth</b> <b>tube,</b> that consists in a glass tube where the particle laden gas flows comes into contact with a supersaturated water vapour environment, generated by a liquid film flowing on the tube internal walls. Preliminary experimental tests have been carried out to define adequate experimental protocols and to find out the most reliable techniques to measure the size and concentration of the liquid-solid aerosol in the water saturated gas that exists the <b>growth</b> <b>tube.</b> Afterwards, an experimental campaign has been carried out to study the heterogeneous condensation of soot particles produced by a ethylene-air premixed flame at different working conditions. Eventually, the experiments have been interpreted through a simplified theoretical model that allows a good description of observed results. Experimental and modelling results eventually provide preliminary guidelines for the design of a pilot scale unit to be tested for future experimentation...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} pollen {{germination}} and <b>tube</b> <b>growth</b> in the pistil involves {{a series of}} cell-cell interactions, some facilitating fertilization while others prohibiting pollen tube access to the female gametophyte, either because of incompatibility or {{as a result of}} mechanisms to avert polyspermy and to ensure reproductive success. Understanding pollen <b>tube</b> <b>growth</b> and guidance to the female gametophyte has long been a pursuit among plant biologists, and observations indicate that diverse strategies may be adopted by different plant species. Recent studies in Arabidopsis, maize, and Torenia fournieri suggest that low molecular weight secretory molecules probably play major roles in the short-range attraction of pollen tubes to the female gametophyte. The process of pollen <b>tube</b> <b>growth</b> in the pistil occurs beneath several cell layers so much of the information that conveys the intimate partnership between penetrating pollen tubes and the female tissues has come from fixed samples and observations of in vitro pollen <b>tube</b> <b>growth</b> responses to female factors. A unique glimpse of the in vivo pollen germination and <b>tube</b> <b>growth</b> process is provided here by intra-vital two-photon excitation (TPE) microscopy of pollinated Arabidopsis pistils that remained on intact plants. Further discoveries of critical factors of male or female origins and how they control the pollen <b>tube</b> <b>growth</b> and fertilization process will broaden our understanding of the common themes and diverse strategies that plants have evolved to ensure reproductive success. The advancement of imaging technology to monitor pollination and fertilization and the development of probes to monitor various aspects of the pollen <b>tube</b> <b>growth</b> process, including pollen intracellular dynamics, will allow us to superimpose details obtained from studying pollen <b>tube</b> <b>growth</b> in culture conditions to interpret and understand the in vivo events...|$|R
