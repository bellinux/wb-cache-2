5000|$|JPL also {{investigated}} [...] "ring sails" [...] (Spinning Disk Sail in {{the above}} <b>diagram),</b> <b>panels</b> attached {{to the edge of}} a rotating spacecraft. The panels would have slight gaps, about one to five percent of the total area. Lines would connect the edge of one sail to the other. Masses in the middles of these lines would pull the sails taut against the coning caused by the radiation pressure. JPL researchers said that this might be an attractive sail design for large manned structures. The inner ring, in particular, might be made to have artificial gravity roughly equal to the gravity on the surface of Mars.|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{the equipment and}} technique used in the author’s palynological carbonization studies. The equipment consists mainly of modified Zeiss microphotographie equipment. A photoelectric cell fitted with a field restrictor is {{used to measure the}} light absorption of a spore or pollen type. The light-absorption value {{is considered to be a}} measure of carbonization, and values of a standard spore or pollen type are used to construct a carbonization line for an individual well. Isocarbonization lines can be constructed in sections to show local or regional carbonization. Maps, block <b>diagrams,</b> <b>panel</b> <b>diagrams,</b> etc., can be constructed with either isocarbonization or carbonization contours. Carbonization is a low-grade metamorphic process; an understanding of this process and its effects can be useful to the petroleum industry. The primary advantage of the described technique is that the degree of carbonization of pollen-grains and spores is a measure of low-grade (organic) metamorphism in areas or intervals devoid of coal. In addition the technique is cheaper and faster than the usual chemical coal analyses. Samples normally taken in the petroleum industry, such as cores, sidewall cores, and cuttings, can be used in palynological carbonization studies. Palynological carbonization studies may be undertaken not only in strata in which palynological time correlations arc possible but also in areas or sections in which alteration is too great for routine palynological time correlation. The carbonization method is unsuccessful in extremely carbonized zones, where alteration makes standard types unrecognizable, or, of course, in strata devoid of pollen-grains and spores. The equipment and technique described here yield reasonably accurate and reproducible data that may shed some light on the temperature history of the organic material, the sediments, and the associated hydrocarbons...|$|R

The first three panels all show the scene with both Snoopy and Woodstock, and thus the spatial structure includes this whole viewpoint (depicted with the dotted line). Panel numbers in Fig.  1 correspond to the indices linking these structures throughout a parallel architecture (Cohn, 2015; Jackendoff, 2002).|$|R
30|$|The {{spectrum}} is also visualized in the mean-field-aligned (MFA) system in Fig.  6, spanning the mean magnetic field direction (the parallel direction) {{and the flow}} direction (in the perpendicular- 1 and parallel plane) in the same panel style as Fig. 5. Again, {{there is no clear}} organization in the wavenumber–frequency <b>diagram</b> (top <b>panels).</b> The wavevector spectrum in the MFA coordinate system indicates that a large amount of the fluctuation energy is associated with the wavevectors that are markedly perpendicular to the mean magnetic field and in the nearly streamwise sense (in the perpendicular- 1 direction). It is interesting to observe that the gyrotropy (axial symmetry around the mean magnetic field) is broken. The spectral energy shows an extension in the oblique direction from the flow direction. This direction happens to be the sunward and northward (toward the center of the plasma sheet) in the GSE coordinate representation (see Fig.  5).|$|R
30|$|To further {{verify the}} {{existence}} of the linear wave modes, the coherent wave components are studied using the dispersion relation diagram and the phase speed diagram for comparison with the MHD linear-mode waves. The dispersion relation diagram presents the distribution of frequencies and the wavevector angles from the mean magnetic field for the local spectral peaks {{as a function of the}} wavenumbers (Fig.  7). The dotted line in the wavenumber–frequency <b>diagram</b> (top <b>panel)</b> represents a reference dispersion relation. Field-aligned Alfvén waves with the relation ω = k V_ A are taken for the reference dispersion relation. The Alfvén speed is estimated around V_ A = 1390.6 km/s. The Doppler shift (which is at most a few hundreds of km/s, see Fig.  2) is not significant as the flow speed is sufficiently below the Alfvén speed. The coherent waves show both higher and lower frequencies than that of the Alfvén waves (on the reference dispersion relation in the top panel), and the wavevector angles are broadly distributed including quasi-parallel, oblique, quasi-perpendicular, and quasi-anti-parallel directions with respect to the mean magnetic field (bottom panel).|$|R
50|$|LabVIEW {{integrates}} {{the creation}} of user interfaces (termed front panels) into the development cycle. LabVIEW programs-subroutines are termed virtual instruments (VIs). Each VI has three components: a block <b>diagram,</b> a front <b>panel,</b> and a connector panel. The last is used to represent the VI in the block diagrams of other, calling VIs. The front panel is built using controls and indicators. Controls are inputs: they allow a user to supply information to the VI. Indicators are outputs: they indicate, or display, the results based on the inputs given to the VI. The back panel, which is a block diagram, contains the graphical source code. All of the objects placed on the front panel {{will appear on the}} back panel as terminals. The back panel also contains structures and functions which perform operations on controls and supply data to indicators. The structures and functions are found on the Functions palette and can be placed on the back panel. Collectively controls, indicators, structures, and functions will be referred to as nodes. Nodes are connected to one another using wires, e.g., two controls and an indicator can be wired to the addition function so that the indicator displays the sum of the two controls. Thus a virtual instrument can be run as either a program, with the front panel serving as a user interface, or, when dropped as a node onto the block <b>diagram,</b> the front <b>panel</b> defines the inputs and outputs for the node through the connector pane. This implies each VI can be easily tested before being embedded as a subroutine into a larger program.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} a closer introduction of the examinating methods of children´s diabetes. Nowadays, diabetes mellitus {{is considered to be}} one of the lifestyle deseases because of the frequent occurence in population and inappropriate life style. Several forms of diabetes can be distinguished. The most frequent desease children suffer from is diabetes mellitus type 1. This type does not produce any insulin which is important for the transformation of food into energy. The theoretical part of this work is devoted to the summary of the basic information about diabetes mellitus, clinical picture, diagnostic possibilities, different treatment, associated deseases, acute and chronic complications. The diabetics should not underestimate the diabetes and they should observe the regimen recommended by doctors because chronic complications of this desease might lead to serious complications causing death in some cases. The practical part focuses primarily on the diagnostic methods, both preanalytic and analytic. Twenty adolescent diabetics were examined in Stafila, s. r. o. laboratory. The measured results were put into tables and <b>diagrams.</b> Diabetic <b>panel</b> was carride out to five teenage diabetics from professor Velemínský´s surgery with the help of RNDr. Vrajová.

30|$|Post-AGB {{stars and}} {{background}} objects {{also tend to}} be the least luminous at 7.0 μm, which is visible in the diagram N 3 –L 24 vs. S 7 (middle panel of Fig. 5), but the luminosity of YSOs is comparable to the luminosity of AGB-stars. Also, multiple objects have a similar tendency as in 3.2 μm and they are among the most luminous stars, but, at 7.0 μm, some AGB stars {{also tend to be}} among the most luminous objects. YSOs and post-AGBs are “redder” than AGB stars and possible AGBs or similar giants. At 11 μm {{it is not clear what}} kind of objects are the most luminous because each group spans quite a wide range of luminosity. In the N 3 –S 11 vs. S 11 <b>diagram</b> (lower <b>panel</b> of Fig. 5) a tendency to form clouds by all groups stretching from a lower to a higher luminosity is visible. Most of the multiple objects and AGBs represent luminosities similar to the background objects, which are less luminous than YSOs. Yet, AGB stars, pulsating giants and multiple systems are well separated from post-AGB stars, YSOs and background objects. Multiple stellar systems, foreground objects, and AGB stars, occupy the “bluer” part of the diagram, while YSOs, post-AGB stars, and background objects, are found in the “redder” part. At 15.0 and 24.0 μm, all different types of objects are widely spread over the luminosity range and it is hard to distinguish the most luminous group.|$|R
40|$|Barind Tract, located north {{western part}} of Bangladesh, {{is one of the}} most diversified physiographic units of the country. The surface water supply in this part is {{particularly}} limited, so the irrigation is almost entirely depends on groundwater. However, over exploitation indicates falling groundwater heads in this area. The objective of present study is to examine the nature of the aquifer system Barind Tract of Bangladesh in order to assess the sustainability of groundwater yield. Borehole lithology data were collected, processed and analyzed for this purpose. Representative <b>panel</b> <b>diagram,</b> 3 -D stratigraphic and cross-sectional views were also prepared for necessary assessment of the variation of individual subsurface stratum in different locations. The study identified three subsurface geologic formations namely, a top clay layer, sand layer of different grain size and at the bottom an impermeable clay zone. Maps of formation thickness and index revealed that aquifer thickness is low in the north-western corner and in some places of middle of south-western corner. The thickness of sand formation in other places is recorded above 20 m. It is expect that the finding of the study will help groundwater resources development, planning and management in the area...|$|R

This system tests two types of sockets of control panel i. e. nonstandard socket and standard socket.

For testing of nonstandard type of socket system needs its wiring diagram, which is to be decoded by Image processing algorithm implemented in MATLAB.

The system checks „Normally closed ‟ and „Normally open ‟ status of pin pairs of control panel mentioned in the wiring diagram in case of non standard socket while in case of standard socket there is no such need of scanning the wiring diagram as it has universal wiring diagram, so those pin pairs are already mentioned in LabVIEW those need to be checked. Also use of other made hardware than national instruments with LabVIEW is described in nonstandard type socket testing...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The Quaternary {{deposits}} of the Hanoi area {{have been investigated}} {{in order to provide}} information required for the design of a groundwater-flow model. Limited sedimentological data exist from 32 destructive drillings carried out previously in the study area. The data base contains hydrographical and hydrogeological observations, but few sedimentological details. This is in contrast with the more seaward regions of the area where the Holocene {{deposits of}} the Red River plain has previously been studied. However, a comparison of the results obtained in this study with the previous studies indicates that the Hanoi sediment succession developed in an incised valley under conditions of rapid relative sealevel rise until ca. 7 - 6 a cal BP. The succession consists initially of alluvial floodplain deposits conformably overlain by mud deposited at the head of an estuary which filled with continuing rapid sea-level rise. Once the relative sea-level rise stabilized, fluvial deposition prograded over the adjacent estuarine mud. The development of a groundwater-flow model requires knowledge of the three-dimensional distribution of the various deposits. Despite the paucity of information with respect to sediment description, a model of the entire Quaternary sequence is presented in several lithostratigraphic crosssections and a <b>panel</b> <b>diagram.</b> The latter forms the basis {{for the construction of a}} contour map of the base of the Pleistocen...|$|R

40|$|Latex {{is a key}} {{product for}} many {{tropical}} countries, of which 80 % is produced by smallholders. Latex is produced by the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis). Given the 7 -year immature unproductive period, establishing a rubber plantation requires considerable investment by smallholders, emphasizing the need for sustainable management. The difficulty of performing an agronomic diagnosis of a tree crop is to obtain an accurate picture of current and past cultivation practices, {{to be able to}} assess their impacts on the agro-ecosystem as well as on sustainability. Smallholders do not usually keep records of latex yield or of their technical practices, making it impossible to perform a diagnosis based on productivity. As latex harvesting involves tapping the bark, which leaves scars on the trunk, we hypothesised that these morphological traces would be good indicators of current and past practices and would thus enable a diagnosis based on the economic lifespan of plantation. To this end, we formalised a tapping panel diagnosis that involved reproducing the scars on tapping <b>panel</b> <b>diagrams,</b> and analysing them using two indicators: the amount of virgin bark consumed and the number of tapping years that remained. We validated this tapping panel diagnosis in a sample of 25 smallholder plantations in Cameroon, where we characterised eight tapping management systems reflecting different levels of tapping intensity. The assessment of the respective share of each tapping practice on virgin bark consumption revealed major effects of tapping frequency and of shaving thickness. We showed that the tapping panel diagnosis used as a decision support tool can increase remaining tapping years by 33 % to 355 %. To conclude, the tapping panel diagnosis formalised {{here for the first time}} will be a useful support for the participatory development of innovating tapping management schemes involving both technicians and smallholders.

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanical}} {{response and}} fracture of metal sandwich panels subjected to multiple impulsive pressure loads (shocks) were investigated for panels with honeycomb and folded plate core constructions. The structural performance of panels with specific core configurations under multiple impulsive pressure loads is quantified by the maximum transverse deflection {{of the face}} sheets and the core crushing strain at mid-span of the panels. A limited set of simulations was carried out to find the optimum core density of a square honeycomb core sandwich panels under two shocks. The panels with a relative core density of 4 %– 5 % are shown to have minimum face sheet deflection for the loading conditions considered here. This {{was consistent with the}} findings related to the sandwich panel response subjected to a single intense shock. Comparison of these results showed that optimized sandwich panels outperform solid plates under shock loading. An empirical method for prediction of the deflection and fracture of sandwich panels under two consecutive shocks – based on finding an effective peak over-pressure – was provided. Moreover, a limited number of simulations related to response and fracture of sandwich panels under multiple shocks with different material properties were performed to highlight the role of metal strength and ductility. In this set of simulations, square honeycomb sandwich panels made of four steels representing a relatively wide range of strength, strain hardening and ductility values were studied. For panels clamped at their edge, the observed failure mechanisms are core failure, top face failure and tearing at or close to the clamped edge. Failure <b>diagrams</b> for sandwich <b>panels</b> were constructed which reveal the fracture and failure mechanisms under various shock intensities for panels subjected to up to three consecutive shocks. The results complement previous studies on the behavior and fracture of these panels under high intensity dynamic loading and further highlights the potential of these panels for development of threat-resistant structural systems...|$|R
40|$|The aim of Bachelor's thesis „Politician's editorials and {{advertisements}} {{before the}} elections in the Postimees 1992 - 2007 ” was to analyse the editorials and advertisements of politicians before Parliament elections throughout the years after Estonia regained its independence. The author of the thesis believed, that the editorials by politicians in the Postimees had decreased {{from one year to}} the next and that the politicians' advertisements have increased, and also that the Postimees own view point was largely dominated by the Isamaa Party in 1992, and starting in 1995 had mostly editorials from members of the Reform Party. Politicians's editorials and advertisements appearing in Postimees before national elections in the years 1992, 1995, 1999, 2003 and 2007 were used to fulfill the research objectives. The research methods used were content analysis and interviews. The analysis unit that was used for the content analysis was one polictician's editorial or advertisement. The essential categories were type of text and area discussed, party, the thickness of the newspaper edition and the year that newspaper was published. There were 51 Postimees editions that appeared before national elections, to be chosen from. Those individuals being interviewed were the Chief Editors and the managing editorial editors that were working at the Postimees during each of the election periods. The author was lucky enough to talk to each of the desired individuals for the research paper, except for Vahur Kalmre (Chief Editor of the Postimess in 1995) and Merit Kopli (Chief Editor of the Postimees in 2007). The goal of applying the conent analysis was to get an overview of what amount of politicians' advertisements as well as editorials were within the volume of the newspaper before the elections occurred, and from that, compare how much space the parties were given for their given views. The idea for the penetrating interviews, was to get commentary from the Chief Editors and managing editorial editors working at the Postimees during the years that elections were occurring, to find out the limitations that were placed for the politicians' editorials as well as the general conduct principles the newspaper had. The research results revealed that in 2003 and 2007, there was significantly fewer political advertisements as well as editorials before the national elections than in other election years. Namely, the amount of political advertisement and the importance of editorials grew until the 1999 elections, and since the 2003 elections, the amount of advertisement and editorial columns have decreased. It can be assumed that the decrease in advertisement does not {{have to do with the}} activity of the newspaper, even though the Postimees has played a big roll in the decrease of importance of opinion polls durnig elections. Firstly, the politicians' conscious deterrence from the opinion polls and secondly, politicians' active presentation of ideas in different formats (different rubriks, questionnaires, <b>diagrams,</b> interviews, <b>panel</b> discussions). Politicians have also ordered less advertisement and written fewer editorials for the paper, thanks to development of new forms of communcation as well as as the editorial staff active actions in introducing the programmes and ideas of different parties. With the support of the results of the conent analysis, it can also be concluded, that before the 1992 national elections, the Isamaa party member editorials did not outweigh other parties editorials, unlike in other election years where the Refrom party editorials considerably outweigh other parties in the Postimees. At the same time, the author would like to point out, that the amount and intercourse of party member editorials in other election years, has been very changeable. The author connected the disproportional presentation of party member editorials, with the development of environmental and media systems, the stance of the newspaper and the outlook on life as well as the topic of an editorial over the dominating party's balancing principle...|$|R
