A high density polyethylene (HDPE) <b>extrusion</b> blow <b>moulded</b> tamper evident container was studied using a finite element based analysis (FEA) {{in order to determine the}} optimized thickness distribution required for the blown part, considering its mechanical specifications.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for efficiency and energy savings can be satisfied by innovative lightweight construction, {{especially in the}} automotive and mechanical engineering sectors. One approach lies in the use and development of magnesium alloys for industrial applications, something which is made more difficult due to magnesium's high affinity for oxygen and its subsequent low corrosion resistance. In order to ensure corrosion protection appropriate to the requirements, thicker coatings which cannot be created using conventional coating processes need to be produced and the current preference is to fabricate these from aluminium. An additional aim {{is to create a}} protective layer to resist mechanical effects. This, based on its dimensioning and consequent higher percentage of mass, is required to contribute towards absorbing the bending and torsion load in the material bond. In addition, a substance to substance bond needs to be created between the cover and the core material. A bond with the required strength can only be expected if the transportation of material across the interface is made possible between the partners for bonding. Under specific technological conditions, it has proved possible to provide evidence of the formation of a distinctive diffusion zone between a wrought magnesium alloy AZ 31 and a standard aluminium alloy EN AW- 6060 [1]. Together with the chemical and contact conditions, the following restrictions, among others, are also important when it comes to triggering a solid body reaction of this nature, namely, almost "ideal" contact between the reactants, a high level of disorder in the lattice structure as well as the supply of a certain amount of energy (the so-called threshold energy) [2]. Consequently, a fundamental principle {{for the creation of a}} bond using metal forming is the targeted interaction of technological parameters which make the maximum increase in the interface surface possible under high standard compressive stresses. Another important aspect is the forming temperature which not only has a decisive influence on the flow behaviour of the partners for bonding but also supplies the necessary amount of energy to activate transport of the material. Under these conditions it was also possible to identify appropriate basic evidence of very rapid diffusion processes during forming, including the forming processes of <b>extrusion</b> <b>moulding</b> and lateral extrusion [3; 4]. The current results as far as indirect <b>extrusion</b> <b>moulding</b> is concerned show that a peripheral bond forms in the interface but that this is weakened by cracks. By applying hydrostatic <b>extrusion</b> <b>moulding</b> it proved possible to prevent inhomogeneities of this nature; however, it may be assumed that, as far as fault-free bonding is concerned, the process window is highly susceptible to error. For this reason provision has been made for tests with intermediate zinc layers for indirect <b>extrusion</b> <b>moulding</b> to enable their influence to be assessed under conditions that are less than ideal when it comes to achieving a perfect bond. Of major interest is the development of phases using an intermediate zinc layer in the interface, as well as their characteristics in the bonding system described...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough UniversityThe programme was concerned {{with the effects of}} processing variables on the structure and properties of coolant reservoir tanks. The work was concentrated on the <b>extrusion</b> blow <b>moulding</b> process and on propylene polymers, following an earlier similar research in the Institute on high density polyethylene. We have worked with a company which specialises in technical blow mouldings; the work has dealt with coolant tanks which are required for high temperature, high pressure service in the presence of antifreeze. It soon became apparent that the application made severe demands on polypropylene in that failure was possible by a variety of mechanisms, including environmental stress cracking and ductile blow-out failure. Additionally, the shaping process by <b>extrusion</b> blow <b>moulding</b> was not being carried out in the optimum way, either with respect to process economics or to product properties. Investigation of the surface texture of corn mercial tanks revealed that shrinkage from the mould occurred frequently due to inadequate holdon pressure; this loss of contact gives poor surface finish and retarded cooling. This phase of the research was supported by a programme carried out on the Bradford University equipment and by providing appropriate thermal data for the Bradford mathematical model for cooling. To reduce the cooling cycle time, the efficacy of internal cooling techniques, including forced air cooling and liquid carbon dioxide, was studied. Further, the possibility of shaping polypropylene in the supercooled region was investigated and a double extruder system was developed to examine the shear viscosity of supercooled polymers. The main concern has been failure caused by stress cracking and environmental stress cracking, especially of development grades of propylene polymers. The structures of various ethylene-modified polypropylenes have been elucidated, as have the relationship of structure' to processing history and its relevance to the severe stress cracking encountered. A new method for determining ethylene content of ethylene- propylene systems has been developed, as {{this is one of the}} important characteristics of ethylene modified polypropylene. The available processes of manufacturing the coolant reservoir tanks have been considered; in particular, competing methods of manufacture of <b>extrusion</b> blow <b>moulding</b> and injection moulding/welding have been compared. The design of coolant tanks, in particular the wall thickness required, has been examined. Stress analysis, supported by tensile failure and relaxation data, has been carried out to provide background to the failures encountered in practice. Finally, possible new candidate material for the coolant tank application, polypropylene-linear low density polyethylene (ethylene-octene copolymer) blends have been investigated...|$|R
