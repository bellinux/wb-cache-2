5|$|In 2001, Toronto City Councillor Paul Sutherland {{proposed}} to add two toll lanes <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>direction</b> along the parkway, from Highway401 to Eglinton Avenue. From Eglinton Avenue south, one lane <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>direction</b> would be added. The proposal was criticized by transportation experts such as Transport 2000 for encouraging driving to downtown. Sutherland estimated {{the cost of}} the proposal at $200 million.|$|E

The freeway loses one lane <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>direction</b> as the interstate passes {{the airport to}} the east. Two diamond interchanges at 700North and 2100North occur as the freeway approaches Davis County. Past 2100North, the freeway enters rural Salt Lake County, and the road curves to the northwest. An interchange at Legacy Parkway gives northbound I-215 motorists and southbound Legacy Parkway motorists their respective connections. The road turns east and loses one lane <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>direction.</b> There is a diamond interchange at SR-68 before the highway merges into northbound I-15 in North Salt Lake.|$|E
5|$|By 1959, {{the pattern}} of {{commuter}} services at Herne Hill had taken the shape it held into the 21st century: all-stops trains from Victoria to Orpington and from the City of London to Wimbledon and Sutton (but, unlike the modern Sutton Loop, via West Croydon). However, there was {{a decline in the}} number of electric trains on the Chatham Main Line through Herne Hill in the years after the war. Immediately after electrification in 1925, six trains used the route between Herne Hill and Shortlands <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>direction</b> during every off-peak hour.

The road briefly turns northeast before drifting north again and gaining one lane <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>direction.</b> Before passing Skypark Airport, the highway loses one lane <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>direction.</b> Redwood Road turns east onto 500 South and enters Bountiful. Past an interchange at I-15, the route gains one passing lane and turns south onto 200 West, a two-lane undivided road. The highway turns southwest and defaults onto southbound US-89 {{within the city}} of Woods Cross.|$|E

Following the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway, the station was served by four trains per day <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>direction</b> until closure in 1935.

5|$|In Hasbrouck Heights, {{the lanes}} split with the Bendix Diner located between the traffic lanes at the {{intersection}} of County Route 40 (Williams Avenue), the last traffic light on Route 17 before the New York state line. At the interchange with U.S. Route 46, which only features access to the eastbound direction of U.S. Route 46, Route 17 drops to two lanes <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>direction</b> and continues north with the lanes merging back together as the road interchanges with County Route 55 (Terrace Avenue) at an interchange. The road enters Hackensack with the lanes splitting again for the long interchange with Interstate 80. Along this strip, the road is again three lanes <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>direction</b> and includes an interchange with County Route 57 (Summit Avenue), crossing into Lodi. The lanes rejoin upon splitting from Interstate 80 with a lane dropping <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>direction</b> at the County Route 56 (Essex Street) interchange on the Maywood border. Route 17 continues north as a congested road through commercial areas, crossing into Rochelle Park where the route interchanges with County Route 62 (Passaic Street) at mile marker 11.46 before entering Paramus.|$|E

5|$|In {{the interim}} period, work went into {{expanding}} the six lane freeway through Toronto and Markham. In early 1998, the MTO {{announced plans for}} two contracts to widen Highway404 south of Highway7. The first contract converted the grass median into an additional lane <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>direction</b> with a central barrier between them. High-mast lighting was also installed, replacing the unique luminaires used on the freeway. The second contract resulted in an additional lane <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>direction</b> on the outside the existing freeway south of Steeles Avenue, making it ten lanes wide. The proposal to eventually convert the inner lanes into HOV lanes was announced at the same time.|$|E

Trains run continually, twenty-four hours a day, with the headway varying from two to four minutes, but with longer intervals (up to twenty minutes) during the night only.
