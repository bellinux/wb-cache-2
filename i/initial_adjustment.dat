In other words, the longer the initial fixed term, the more the bank would like to potentially adjust your loan.

30|$|Consistent {{with the}} {{regression}} models, contact about both general program/curriculum information and specific {{information on the}} child was positively predictive of <b>initial</b> social <b>adjustment</b> (0.16, p <  0.05).

Moreover, {{as reported in the}} first column of Table  5, the indirect effect from contact between teachers to social adjustment and, in turn, to academic adjustment was statistically significant (0.08, p <  0.05). In addition, as indicated in Table  4, <b>initial</b> social <b>adjustment</b> positively predicted mid-year assessments of social skills, providing a significant (see Table  5) indirect link from teacher contact to <b>initial</b> social <b>adjustment</b> to mid-year social skills.|$|R
40|$|The ν-Support Vector Regression (ν-SVR) is an {{effective}} regression learning algorithm, which {{has the advantage of}} using a parameter ν on controlling the number of support vectors and adjusting the width of the tube automatically. However, compared to ν-Support Vector Classification (ν-SVC) (Schölkopf et al., 2000), ν-SVR introduces an additional linear term into its objective function. Thus, directly applying the accurate on-line ν-SVC algorithm (AONSVM) to ν-SVR will not generate {{an effective}} initial solution. It is the main challenge to design an incremental ν-SVR learning algorithm. To overcome this challenge, we propose a special procedure called <b>initial</b> <b>adjustments</b> in this paper. This procedure adjusts the weights of ν-SVC based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions to prepare an initial solution for the incremental learning. Combining the <b>initial</b> <b>adjustments</b> with the two steps of AONSVM produces an exact and effective incremental ν-SVR learning algorithm (INSVR). Theoretical analysis has proven the existence of the three key inverse matrices, which are the cornerstones of the three steps of INSVR (including the <b>initial</b> <b>adjustments),</b> respectively. The experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that INSVR can avoid the infeasible updating paths as far as possible, and successfully converges to the optimal solution. The results also show that INSVR is faster than batch ν-SVR algorithms with both cold and warm starts...|$|R
2500|$|Inside the {{business}} caps are expressed most often by simply the three numbers involved that signify each cap. For example, a 5/1 Hybrid ARM {{may have a}} cap structure of 5/2/5 (5% <b>initial</b> cap, 2% <b>adjustment</b> cap and 5% lifetime cap) and insiders would call this a 5-2-5 cap. [...] Alternatively, a 1-year ARM might have a 1/1/6 cap (1% <b>initial</b> cap, 1% <b>adjustment</b> cap and 6% lifetime cap) known as a 1-1-6, or alternatively expressed as a 1/6 cap (leaving out one digit signifies that the <b>initial</b> and <b>adjustment</b> caps are identical).|$|R

Durán, as a 2-to-1 underdog, scored a knockdown against the defending champion just fifteen seconds into the opening round and battered him throughout the bout. He was well ahead on all three cards as the bell rang to end the 13th round, at which time Durán (apparently not hearing the bell) continued to throw a couple of extra punches as Buchanan lay on the ropes. As Duran continued punching, the referee, Johnny LoBianco, grabbed him to pull him away. He pulled down on Duran's arms, {{which led to a}} seemingly accidental low blow.

40|$|Abstract. In the CARINA (Carbon {{dioxide in}} the Atlantic Ocean) project, a new dataset with many {{previously}} unpublished hydrographic data from the Atlantic, Arctic and Southern Ocean was assembled and subjected to careful quality control (QC) procedures. Here, we present the dissolved oxygen measurements in the Atlantic region of the dataset and describe in detail the secondary QC procedures that aim {{to ensure that the}} data are internally consistent. This is achieved by a cross-over analysis, i. e. the comparison of deep ocean data at places that were sampled by different cruises at different times. <b>Initial</b> <b>adjustments</b> to the individual cruises were then determined by an inverse procedure that computes a set of adjustments that requires the minimum amount of adjustment {{and at the same time}} reduces the offsets in an optimal manner. The <b>initial</b> <b>adjustments</b> were then reviewed by the CARINA members, and only those that passed the following two criteria were adopted: (i) the region is not subject to substantial temporal variability, and (ii) the adjustment must be based on at least three stations from each cruise. No adjustment was recommended for cruises that did not fit these criteria. The final CARINA-Oxygen dataset has 103414 oxygen samples from 9491 stations obtained during 98 cruises covering three decades. The sampling density of the oxygen data is particularly good in the North Atlantic north of about 40 ◦ N especially after 1987. In contrast, the sample density in the South Atlantic is much lower.

5|$|After landing, Young and Duke began {{powering}} {{down some of}} the LM's systems to conserve battery power. Upon completing their <b>initial</b> <b>adjustments,</b> the pair configured Orion for their three-day stay on the lunar surface, removed their space suits and took initial geological observations of the immediate landing site.

The landing delay caused by the malfunction in the Command/Service Module's main engine necessitated significant modifications to the mission schedule. Apollo 16 would spend one less day in lunar orbit after surface exploration had been completed to afford the crew contingency time to compensate for any further problems and to conserve expendables. In order to improve Young's and Duke's sleep schedule, the third and final moonwalk of the mission was trimmed from seven hours to five.|$|R

Real economic efficiency could only be achieved by permitting and even forcing considerable immediate dislocations, whereas temporary compromises might lead to permanent structural burdens. However, excessive disruptions could jeopardize the economic and political stability required for a smooth unification process and might also cause streams of East Germans to move west. The government was never able to solve this dilemma. When it was forced to choose, it usually selected the more expensive and slower course to encourage persons to stay in the east.|$|E

40|$|To improve jumping performance, {{this paper}} {{presents}} a jumping robot with <b>initial</b> body posture <b>adjustment</b> and a self-righting mechanism.

50|$|One of the <b>initial</b> <b>adjustment</b> {{overlooked}} by many new users is the lenses vertical parallax, that {{must not be}} confused with the horizontal parallax (set manually by the left rocker button). Although the lenses should be perfectly aligned, by design, there is a small vertical axis error inherent for each camera body. This error implies that all pictures (and videos as well) taken with a wrong vertical parallax are harder to look at, because one eye is looking up while the other is looking down. To effectively correct this optical discrepancy, the camera offers a vertical parallax correction in its menu system: MENU/SET/OPT AXIS CONTROL. The best way to use this adjustment is to zoom at maximum, take a picture, then analyse it with a software stereoscopic player(using row or column interlaced view) to obtain the subject at the same vertical level.|$|E

We have examined wheather <b>initial</b> emotional <b>adjustment</b> and psychological needs would serve as a mediator of the relationship between attachment dimensions (anxiety and avoidance) and depressive symptoms. A sample consisted of 219 students (143 females) randomly selected from the University of Rijeka, Croatia, with mean age 19. 02 years. Participants provided self-report on the Experiences in Close Relationship Inventory and The Student Adaptation to College Questionnaire at the beginning of the first year of college, and The Basic Psychological Needs Satisfaction Scale and Beck Depression Inventory-II at the third year of college. Results of hierarchical regression analyses confirm that emotional adjustment had a full mediation effect on anxiety dimension and partial mediation on avoidance dimension. Only a partial mediation effect of psychological needs for autonomy and relatedness between attachment and depressive symptoms was found. The findings of this study give support to the researches indicating the importance of parental attachment for college students not only through its direct effects on depressive symptoms, but also through effects on the <b>initial</b> emotional <b>adjustment</b> and satisfaction of psychological needs. The results of the mediation analysis suggest that both attachment dimensions and emotional adjustment as well as psychological need satisfaction have a substantial shared variance when predicting depressive symptoms and that each variable also gives a unique contribution to depressive symptoms...|$|R
