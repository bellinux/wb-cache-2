40|$|Since {{induction}} motors are preferred over {{direct current}} {{machines in the}} view of cost and simplicity, they have widely been used in industry. In this paper, the speed of the three-phase induction motor has been controlled using an indirect z-source matrix converter. The method used for this purpose is flux control keeping the V/f ratio and regulating slippage. The effect of flux changes and reference velocity in this method has been taken into consideration and various <b>electric</b> <b>break</b> methods on the motor have been studied accordingly. Coefficients of PI controllers have been obtained in the proposed system for desirable response by PSO Algorithm. The proposed system with the respective converter has been simulated in SIMULINK environment using the information of an induction machine by MATLAB Software. The results show to using the proposed system and indirect z-source matrix converter, appropriate velocity and desirable torque are obtained in a short time. </p...|$|E

40|$|An {{existence}} of the charge-induced instability {{is well known for}} the 4 He crystal surface in the rough state. Much less is known about charge-induced instability at the 4 He crystal surface in the smooth well-faceted state below the roughening transition temperature. To meet the lack, we examine here the latter case. As long as the electric field normal to the crystal facet is below the critical value same as for the rough surface, the crystal faceting remains absolutely stable. Above the critical field, unlike absolutely unstable state of the rough surface, the crystal facet crosses over to the metastable state separated from new crushed state with a potential barrier proportional to the square of the linear facet step energy. The onset and development of the instability at the charged crystal facet has much in common with the nucleation kinetics of first-order phase transitions. Depending on the temperature, the <b>electric</b> <b>breaking</b> strength is determined either by thermal activation at high temperatures or by quantum tunneling at sufficiently low temperatures.

40|$|Scaling {{graphene}} down to nanoribbons is {{a promising}} route {{for the implementation}} of this material into devices. Quantum confinement of charge carriers in such nanostructures, combined with the <b>electric</b> field-induced <b>break</b> of symmetry in AB-stacked bilayer graphene, leads to a band gap wider than that obtained solely by this symmetry breaking. Consequently, the possibility of fabricating AB-stacked bilayer graphene nanoribbons with high precision is very attractive for the purposes of applied and basic science. Here we show a method, which includes a straightforward air annealing, for the preparation of quasi-free-standing AB-bilayer nanoribbons with different widths on SiC(0001). Furthermore, the experiments reveal that the degree of disorder at the edges increases with the width, indicating that the narrower nanoribbons are more ordered in their edge termination. In general, the reported approach is a viable route towards the large-scale fabrication of bilayer graphene nanostructures with tailored dimensions and properties for specific applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{variation}} of the aperture angle on spectral and magnetic properties of one-electron nanotube of the axially symmetrical conical shape {{in the presence of}} the electric and magnetic fields have been investigated based on a numerical solution of the Schrödinger equation in the effective mass approximation. We show that the energy spectrum and the magnetic dipole moment of the structure are changed dramatically with increase of the cone’s aperture angle due to the interplay between the diamagnetic and centrifugal forces, which push the electron at opposite directions. Particularly, the energy levels close to the ground state become quasi-degenerate, owing to a change of the hidden symmetry, induced by the magnetic field in this structure, when its morphology is converted from the cylindrical type to the conical one and the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations of the ground state energy and of the magnetic dipole moment are quenched.

40|$|We {{investigate}} here how {{the current}} flows over a bilayer graphene {{in the presence}} of an external electric field perpendicularly applied (biased bilayer). Charge density polarization between layers in these systems is known to create a layer pseudospin, which can be manipulated by the electric field. Our results show that current does not necessarily flow over regions of the system with higher charge density. Charge can be predominantly concentrated over one layer, while current flows over the other layer. We find that this phenomenon occurs when the charge density becomes highly concentrated over only one of the sublattices, as the <b>electric</b> field <b>breaks</b> layer and sublattice symmetries for a Bernal-stacked bilayer. For bilayer nanoribbons, the situation is even more complex, with a competition between edge and bulk effects for the definition of the current flow. We show that, in spite of not flowing trough the layer where charge is polarized to, the current in these systems also defines a controllable layer pseudospin. Comment: 9 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
