5|$|Portrait of Monsieur Bertin is an 1832 oil-on-canvas {{painting}} by Jean-Auguste-Dominique <b>Ingres.</b> It depicts Louis-François Bertin (1766–1841), the French writer, art collector {{and director of}} the pro-royalist Journal des débats. <b>Ingres</b> completed the portrait during his first period of success; having achieved acclaim as a history painter, he accepted portrait commissions with reluctance, regarding them as a distraction from more important work. Bertin was a friend and a politically active member of the French upper-middle class. <b>Ingres</b> presents him as a personification of the commercially minded leaders of the liberal reign of Louis Philippe I. He is physically imposing and self-assured, but his real-life personality shines through– warm, wry and engaging to those who had earned his trust.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ingres</b> was self-critical and {{consumed}} by self-doubt. He often took months {{to complete a}} portrait, leaving large periods of inactivity between sittings. With Bertin, he agonised in finding a pose to best convey both the man's restless energy and his age. At least seven studies survive, three are signed and dated. <b>Ingres</b> was a master draftsman and the sketches, if not fully realised, are highly regarded in their own right. The sketches are exemplary in their handling of line and form, and similar in size.|$|E
5|$|It was {{completed}} within a month, during Ingres' frequent visits to Bertin's estate of retreat, Le Château des Roches, in Bièvres, Essonne. <b>Ingres</b> made daily visits, as Bertin entertained guests such as Victor Hugo, his mistress Juliette Drouet, Hector Berlioz, and later Franz Liszt and Charles Gounod. <b>Ingres</b> later made {{drawings of the}} Bertin family, including a depiction of his host's wife and sketches of their son Armand and daughter-in-law, Cécile. The portrait of Armand evidences his physical resemblance to his father.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year <b>Ingres</b> sought to capitalise {{on the success}} of his Bertin portrait. He showed his ambitious history painting The Martyrdom of Saint Symphorian at the 1834 Salon, but it was harshly criticised; even Ingres' admirers offered only faint praise. Offended and frustrated, <b>Ingres</b> declared he would disown the Salon, abandon his residence in Paris for Rome, and relinquish all current positions, ending his role in public life. This petulance was not to last.|$|E
5|$|Louis-François Bertin was 66 in 1832, {{the year}} of the portrait. He befriended <b>Ingres</b> either through his son Édouard Bertin, a student of the painter, or via Étienne-Jean Delécluze, Ingres' friend and the Journals art critic. In either case the genesis of the {{commission}} is unknown. Bertin was a leader of the French upper class and a supporter of Louis Philippe and the Bourbon Restoration. He was a director of the Le Moniteur Universel until 1823, when the Journal des débats became the recognised voice of the liberal-constitutional opposition after he had come to criticize absolutism. He eventually gave his support to the July Monarchy. The Journal supported contemporary art, and Bertin was a patron, collector and cultivator of writers, painters and other artists. <b>Ingres</b> was sufficiently intrigued by Bertin's personality to accept the commission.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} had {{a prolonged}} genesis. <b>Ingres</b> agonised over the pose and made several preparatory sketches. The final work faithfully captures the sitter's character, conveying both a restless energy and imposing bulk. It is an unflinchingly realistic depiction of ageing and emphasises the furrowed skin and thinning hair of an overweight man who yet maintains his resolve and determination. He sits in three-quarter profile against a brown ground lit from the right, his fingers are pronounced and highly detailed, while the polish {{of his chair}} reflects light from an unseen window.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{study has}} Bertin standing and leaning {{on a table}} in an almost Napoleonic pose. His hard, level stare is already established, but the focus seems to be on his groin rather than his face. It is obvious that <b>Ingres</b> struggled with the sketch; the head is on a square of attached paper which must have replaced an earlier cut-out version, and other areas have been rubbed over and heavily reworked. The next extant drawing shows Bertin seated, but the chair is missing. The last extant sketch is the closest to the eventual painting, with a chair, though his bulk has not yet been filled out.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} is composed in monochrome, muted colours; predominately blacks, greys and browns. The exceptions are {{the whites of}} his collar and sleeves, the reds in the cushion and the light reflecting on the leather of the arm-chair. In 19th-century art, vivid colour was associated with femininity and emotion; male portraiture tended towards muted shades and monochrome. Bertin leans slightly forward, boldly staring at the viewer {{in a manner that}} is both imposing and paternal. He seems engaged, and poised to speak, his body fully towards the viewer and his expression etched with certainty. Influenced by Nicolas Poussin's 1650 Self-Portrait with Allegory of Painting, <b>Ingres</b> minutely details the veins and wrinkles of his face. Bertin is in three-quarter profile, against a gold–brown background lit from the right. He rests on a curved-back mahogany chair, the arms of which reflect light falling from the upper left of the pictorial space.|$|E
5|$|Velázquez's {{portrait}} is {{a staging}} {{of a private}} moment of intimacy and a dramatic departure from the classical depictions of sleep and intimacy found in works from antiquity and Venetian art that portray Venus. However, the simplicity with which Velázquez displays the female nude—without jewellery {{or any of the}} goddess's usual accessories—was echoed in later nude studies by <b>Ingres,</b> Manet, and Baudry, among others. In addition, Velázquez's depiction of Venus as a reclining nude viewed from the rear was a rarity before that time, although the pose has been painted by many later artists. Manet, in his stark female portrayal Olympia, paraphrased the Rokeby Venus in pose and by suggesting the persona of a real woman rather than an ethereal goddess. Olympia shocked the Parisian art world when it was first exhibited in 1863. Olympia gazes directly out at the viewer, as does Velázquez's Venus, only through the reflection of the mirror.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} based on sex {{difference}} in ways of seeing, perceiving, and representing nudity and the theme of the nude. A sex difference is seen in different representations of female and male nudes on the one hand, {{and on the other hand}} in the different ways men and women view the naked body. Until the twentieth century, male figures were represented less often than female images. Female nudes have been the main subject in the tradition of western painting. This reflects the sexual dichotomy between viewing, more connected with the male side, and the body, more connected with the female side. Sex differences are highlighted through a comparison of <b>Ingre’s</b> famous nineteenth-century painting Grande Odalisque and one of the most popular feminist posters of the twentieth century: Do Women Have to be Naked to Get into the Met. Museum? by the activist artistic group Guerrilla Girls. The question is how the nakedness of the female nude in the poster by Guerrilla Girls differs from the nudity of <b>Ingre’s</b> Odalisque, to which the women artists referred. The Guerrilla Girls work indicates how it is possible to oppose the established binary structures of men as subjects in the roles of artists, spectators, collectors, and owners of artworks on the one hand, and women as objects in the roles of passive and nude models on the other...|$|R

25|$|<b>Ingres</b> {{was born}} in Montauban, Tarn-et-Garonne, France, the first of seven {{children}} (five of whom survived infancy) of Jean-Marie-Joseph <b>Ingres</b> (1755–1814) and his wife Anne Moulet (1758–1817). His father was a successful jack-of-all-trades in the arts, a painter of miniatures, sculptor, decorative stonemason, and amateur musician; his mother was the nearly illiterate daughter of a master wigmaker. From his father the young <b>Ingres</b> received early encouragement and instruction in drawing and music, and his first known drawing, a study after an antique cast, was made in 1789. Starting in 1786 he attended the local school École des Frères de l'Éducation Chrétienne, but his education was disrupted by the turmoil of the French Revolution, and {{the closing of the}} school in 1791 marked the end of his conventional education. The deficiency in his schooling would always remain for him a source of insecurity.|$|E
25|$|The {{dispute between}} the two {{painters}} and schools reappeared at the 1827 Salon, where <b>Ingres</b> presented L'Apotheose d'Homer, an example of classical balance and harmony, while Delacroix showed The Death of Sardanapalus, another glittering and tumultuous scene of violence. The duel between the two painters, each considered {{the best of his}} school, continued over the years. Paris artists and intellectuals were passionately divided by the conflict, although modern art historians tend to regard <b>Ingres</b> and other Neoclassicists as embodying the Romantic spirit of their time.|$|E

40|$|Electron cloud {{activity}} {{has been observed}} in some positron storage rings but not in others. It {{is a major concern}} for the LHC. In this paper the electron cloud problematics is treated purely analytica lly. The equilibrium electron cloud density is derived from the standard photon production rate, taking into account the photo-electric yield and the process of secondary emission. A fundamental <b>ingre</b> dient in the derivation is the Kollath{ 2] energy spectrum of the secondary emission. The phenomenon of space charge is discussed as well. The transverse acceleration of the electrons by the bunches is used to introduce the concept of closely and sparsely bunched beams. There is a fundamental difference between them, especially {{from the point of view}} of power deposition. Expressions for an equivalen t transverse impedance and imaginary tune shift are derived. Finally the analysis is confronted with electron cloud observations in existing positron machines (DAPHINE, PF, BEPC) before it is applied to the LHC. It comes out rather clearly that the nominal 25 ns bunch spacing in the LHC does not offer enough safety margin in terms of power deposition in the beam screen and that the alternative of 5 0 ns deserves serious consideration...|$|R
40|$|Rats of 3 strains {{were fed}} diets of natural <b>ingre.</b> dients in 4 {{different}} laboratories. The diets con· tained {{different levels of}} protein and energy within ranges comparable {{to those found in}} existing laboratory diets. Energy level over the range examined appeared to exert greatest influ-ence on bodyweight gain, but had no effect on food intake. The diet with the highest amino acid content was consumed in smaller amounts than the other diets. Foed utilization was less efficient in the lower energy diets. Fat deposition was reduced in animals fed the lowest energy diet. It is concluded that energy level of the diet exerts an effect on the rate of bodyweight gain in rats, but that for longer-term studies a reduced energy level may be beneficial by leading to smaller fat deposits with consequent increase in longevity. While requirements of laboratory animals for micro-nutrients have in certain cases been studied in considerable detail (NRC, 1977; 1978) their requirements for the major nutrients, protein and energy- and particularly the inter-relationship between the two- has been largely neglected. Many of the laboratory animal diets in common use to-day were formulated empirically, drawing largely on information obtained from monogastric farm animals. For example, calculated values for metabolizable energy in diets for laboratory animals are commonly based on figures for chickens o...|$|R

It is typically fatal within 2 – 5 years of symptom onset. The incidence of ALS is largely uniform across most parts of the world, but an increasing ALS incidence during the last decades has been suggested. Although recent genetic studies have substantially improved our understanding of the causes of ALS, especially familial ALS, an important role of non-genetic factors in ALS is recognized and needs further study. In this review, we briefly discuss several major genetic contributors to ALS identified to date, followed by a more focused discussion on the most commonly examined non-genetic risk factors for ALS. We first review factors related to lifestyle choices, including smoking, intake of antioxidants, physical fitness, body mass index, and physical exercise, followed by factors related to occupational and environmental exposures, including electromagnetic fields, metals, pesticides, β-methylamino-L-alanine, and viral infection. Potential links between ALS and other medical conditions, including head trauma, metabolic diseases, cancer, and inflammatory diseases, are also discussed. Finally, we outline several future directions aiming to more efficiently examine the role of non-genetic risk factors in ALS.

No study so far has been directed toward real-life experience of outpatients receiving anticoagulants for VTE in France. Methods: This is an observational descriptive real-life epidemiological study, using three validated questionnaires (Morisky Medication Adherence Scale- 8, EQ- 5 D, and part 2 of the Perception of Anticoagulant Treatment Questionnaire), to assess adherence, quality of life, and satisfaction in 100 VTE outpatients receiving anticoagulation therapy by VKA (primary or switched from DOAC to VKA) or by DOAC (primary or switched from VKA to DOAC). Results: Patients were very much satisfied with their treatment in both DOAC and VKA groups. Despite advantages of DOACs, therapeutic adherence was only moderate. The best adherence scores were observed in the primary VKA switched to DOAC for at least 3 months (S-DOAC) subgroup. Quality of life was better in the DOAC group mainly because of the absence of the requirement for blood testing. Most of the complaints concerned the pain/discomfort dimension in the VKA group and anxiety/depression dimension in the DOAC group. Conclusion: Patients were satisfied with their anticoagulant treatment, especially when they were involved in choosing the anticoagulant, and the treatment suited them. Quality of life of patients in the DOAC group was better than in the VKA group, but adherence remains to be improved. This study highlights the importance of the physician–patient relationship, pretreatment initiation, and follow-up of any anticoagulation therapy throughout.

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{providing}} fundamental information con ern ing the manufacture, composition, and consumption of the major Kenyan traditional fermented beverages. In Chapter 1, the reader is introduced to Kenya, its population and climate, and several aspects of its agriculture underlying this study. Chapter 2 offers {{an overview of the}} major fermented beverages con sumed in Kenya. A distinction is made between traditional and foreign fermented beverages. Both groups of products include beers and wines, as well as spirits. The traditional fermented beverages play an important role, particularly in the rural daily life, they are cheap and are usually prepared from locally available <b>ingre</b> dients such as honey, maize, millets or palm-sap. Their age-old manufacturing techniques are known through oral tradition and are often quite primitive. The final products are obtained by way of uncontrolled fermentations, and are mostly consumed in a stage of active fermentation. Except for the spirits, the traditional fermented beverages have only a short shelf-life since excessive souring soon renders them unacceptable. Most foreign fermented beverages have been introduced into Kenya during the period of colonial administration; nowadays, a number are manufactured locally, on a large industrial scale. In Chapter 3, mention is made of recent measures taken by the Kenyan Government to curb alcoholism through prohibition and clo sure of beer halls, and to increase productivity. These measures tend to favour the illegal trade in traditional fermented bever agesand,in particular, the consumption of illicit traditional spirit of dubious quality. The aims of the ensuing study are formulated in Chapter 4, and include providing insight in the consumption of the major Kenyan traditional fermented beverages, their nutritive value, and their possible harmfulness to health. Furthermore, a study will be made of ways of improving upon the quality and shelf-life of a selected traditional beer of superior nutritive value. In Chapter 5, an estimate is made of the total consumption of alcoholic beverages in Kenya. It is shown that the traditional fermented beverages represent a major proportion of the total con sumption of alcohol. This is not surprising since the traditional products are relatively cheap and can be afforded by the majority of the Kenyan public. In the same chapter, it is observed that the consumption of alco hol in Kenya is moderate, compared with other countries. The nutrient content of selected traditional and foreign beverages is compared in Chapter 6. It is concluded that the traditional beer Busaa has the highest nutritive value, particularly when considering its protein, vitamin B 2 , and niacin contents. The nutritive value of the traditional spirit Chang'aa is the least. The consumption of Chang'aa occupies a major proportion of the total quantity of alcohol consumed in Kenya. The chemical composition of this spirit is studied in some further detail in Chapter 7. In particular, the fusel oil content of Chang'aa is studied, as well as the effect of ingredients and distilling techniques on its occurrence in this spirit. In Chapters 8, 9, and 10 several aspects of the manufacture of the traditional beer Busaa are dealt with. In Chapter 8, some microbiological aspects of the traditional manufacture of this beer are discussed. In particular, attention is given to the dominant yeasts and bacteria, involved in the stages of fermentation and subsequent spoilage. In Chapter 9, experimental work is described, aimed at the development of a process for the manufacture of bottled and preserved Busaa. The malt used as ingredient for Busaa is usually obtained from finger millet. In most other African countries however, sorghum is used for such purpose. Although sorghum is easily available in Kenya as well, the Busaa brewers nevertheless prefer the use of finger millet malt for the brewing of Busaa. In Chapter 10 therefore, the germination characteristics and the brewing potential of finger millet and sorghum are compared. Barley is also included in this comparative study, since it is grown in Kenya as ingredient for the manufacture of foreign lager beers. In Chapter 11, the major findings from the study are discussed, and conclusions and recommendations are formulated with regard to a possible control of the consumption of traditional fermented beverages. On the one hand, these are aimed at a reduction and subsequent gradual abolishment of home-brewing of traditional fermented beverages. On the other hand, the consumption of cheap traditional fermented beverages of high nutritive value such as Busaa, is advocated to be allowed to continue off-licence on a restricted scale. Such products should offer a cheap, high-grade substitute for other, less appropriate, products which would eventually be phased out. It is finally observed that an upgrading of the quality and shelf-life of the former beverages would facilitate an adjustment of the present consumption pattern...|$|R
