40|$|Shallow lakes display {{hysteresis}} {{in their}} response to <b>phosphorous</b> <b>loading.</b> Gradual increases in the nutrient content of the lake can appear to have {{little effect on the}} oligotrophic state of the lake until a point at which the lake suddenly flips to a eutrophic state. Ecotaxes on <b>phosphorous</b> <b>loading</b> have been suggested as means to maintain the lake in the socially desirable state - oligotrophic or not - when society can agree on a common welfare function. In this paper, we consider the case where society is divided into two interest groups and is thus unable to agree. In particular, the communities that share the use of the lake disagree on the relative importance of the shallow lake acting as a waste sink for phosphorous run-off as opposed to other ecosystem service. A dynamic game in which communities maximize their use of the lake results in a Nash equilibrium where the lake is in a eutrophic state when in fact the Pareto-optimum would be for the lake to be in an oligotrophic state. The tax that would induce, in a non-cooperative context, all of society's members to behave {{in such a way as}} to achieve a Pareto-optimal outcome is derived. Further, both types of communities lobby to have their preferred level of tax applied based on their relative preferences for a clean lake and <b>phosphorous</b> <b>loading.</b> The effects of the lobbying on the application of the optimal tax are investigated for particular values of relative preferences and the relative size of each group.

The paper presents a GIS method for estimating the total <b>phosphorous</b> (TP) <b>load</b> from proxy data representing sub-catchment land use and census data. The modelled load of TP is compared to the actual transfer of TP in the Pilica River system. The results shows that the metrics of connectivity between river system and dwelling areas as well as settlement density in the sub-catchments are useful predictors of the total <b>phosphorous</b> <b>load.</b> The presence of a large reservoir in the middle course of the river can disrupt nutrient transport along a river continuum by trapping and retaining suspended sediment and its associated TP load.

In the Great Salt Lake Basin the delicate balance between precipitation and evaporation that controls lake level fluctuations is a sensitive indicator of changes in hydrologic processes and amplifies the effects of structured low-frequency climate variability, thus providing a sensitive barometer of long term climate change. A number of existing projects build synergy towards an integrated observing infrastructure in the Great Salt Lake Basin {{for the study of}} integrated hydrologic and environmental processes. This presentation will describe the work we are doing to integrate these projects to establish a Hydrologic Observatory. This presentation will also describe the Little Bear River test bed project which is one of eleven test bed projects awarded by the National Science Foundation that comprise the WATer and Engineering Research System network (WATERS network). A test bed project is a pilot study that allows key questions and methods to be tested before larger scale application. The Little Bear River test bed project is installing a set of “smart” sensors, connected to a central database, that will frequently collect data on the easily measured characteristics of streamflow, turbidity, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen.

However, this approach is costly and generates additional waste. Therefore, inexpensive and sustainable methods for wastewater post-treatment are wanted. The artificial aquatic food-web that performs wastewater phycoremediation by algae and subsequent biomass harvest by filter-feeding organisms not only requires low energy consumption but also produces biomass for treatment process cost recovery. Still, the knowledge on its performance at different scales and under different climates are limited. In this review, the application possibilities of the artificial aquatic food-web for domestic wastewater post-treatment is discussed, focusing on its use in cold climate regions. Considering the reduced biological activity of aquatic organisms at low ambient temperature, possible solutions for its performance and prospect application at low temperatures are suggested.

40|$|Beneficial Management Practices (BMPs) are {{important}} measures for reducing agricultural non-point source (NPS) pollution. However, selection of BMPs for placement in a watershed requires optimizing available resources to maximize possible water quality benefits.

In this study, an optimization model, consisting of a multi-objective genetic algorithm, ε-NSGA-II, in combination with the Soil Water and Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the parallel computation technique, is developed and tested in the Fairchild Creek watershed in southern Ontario of Canada. The two objectives are to minimize BMPs costs and maximize total <b>phosphorous</b> <b>load</b> reduction. The parallel computation allows the run of multiple SWAT models simultaneously and can reduce the ε-NSGA-II optimization time significantly to achieve the objective.

The combination of two datasets resulted in a full description of the estuaries water quality parameters from the mouth to the upper boundary, including an extended fresh water tidal part.

The study was performed {{on behalf of the}} Eel River Watershed Association, in response to specific concerns regarding eutrophication of the watershed. These concerns are focused on increased nutrient loading caused by a recently constructed Waste Water Treatment Facility, as well as increased development (i. e., golf courses and residential).

Because most of the nutrient load is received by the western basin, a sharp trophic gradient developed in the lake: the western part is hypertrophic, while the eastern remains meso-eutrophic. The paper describes the phytoplankton changes {{in the last four years}} (1989 - 1992) both in the hypertrophic and meso-eutrophic parts of the lake. Floristic changes of the last 60 years, long term trends of quantitative changes change and short-term (daily) responses of phytoplankton to weather changes are discussed with special attention to Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii, a key species in the lake. The paper concludes that the management program that was started in 1983 to restore the lake and during which the external P load was reduced by about 40 % has so far not resulted in significant improvement in water quality, for the P accumulated in the sediment in the period of high external load still supports the development of high late summer algal crops...|$|R

Since the early 2000 ’s there has been a resurgence of Cladophora growth in near-shore Lake Michigan.

40|$|Includes bibliography. Phosphate is an {{essential}} nutrient for photosynthetic plant growth. However if over-supplied in a water body, it leads to excessive algal growth, a condition is termed eutrophication. Eutrophication is not only unsightly, but renders the water less usable. Most of the highly eutrophied water bodies with a high phosphorus load still receive up to 90 of their phosphorus input from effluents discharged by sewage treatment works (Pretorius, 1983). The phosphorus content of domestic sewage originates from two main sources, namely human waste {± 60) and detergents {± 40) (Heynike and Wiechers, 1986). There is an argument for a ban on phosphate in detergents to reduce the phosphate load on sewage treatment plants and thereby limit phosphate discharges via treated municipal effluent. The removal of phosphate from detergent formulations has been an effective way in many countries of reducing the <b>phosphorous</b> <b>load</b> to receiving waters. In South Africa, detergent manufacturers are anticipating consumer pressure to reformulate their detergent products to eliminate phosphate. The two possible replacements for phosphates are zeolite 4 A and high surface area {HSA) calcite.

The process of solid transformation and {{properties of materials}} prepared from ammonium hydrogen phosphate (AMP) -impregnated samples were {{compared with those of}} phosphide made from phosphoric acid (PAC) -impregnated samples.

In total, 14 measures are included for nitrogen (N) reductions and 12 for phosphorous (P) reduction, {{out of which}} six measures affect both nutrients. Calculations show that land use measures provide low cost measures for N reductions and P free detergents and improved sewage cleaning for P reductions. Two types of targets are chosen for calculation of minimum cost solutions: overall reductions of nutrient to the Baltic Sea and reductions to specific basins. Three different assumptions on adjustments among basins to exogenous load changes are made for basin specific targets; no adjustment, partial first-order adjustment, and total steady state adjustment. For a given nutrient reduction in percent, both estimated total cost and cost effective allocation of reduction in loads to different basins vary considerably depending on target setting. However, costs of different measures, and thereby estimated minimum cost solutions are sensitive to parameter values on leaching, retention, and abatement cost and capacity. Sensitivity analyses show that minimum costs of nitrogen reductions are mainly affected by changes in assumed abatement capacity of land use measures, and costs of phosphorus reductions are sensitive to cleaning cost at sewage treatment plants...|$|R

40|$|As {{a country}} in the Mediterranean region, Turkey must face the {{effects of climate change}} on water quality and quantity. Decision support systems are {{accepted}} as useful and practical tools for the protection and management of water resources. The need for such tools is rapidly emerging in conjunction with industrial developments in Turkey. Against this background, the empirical area-differentiated phosphorus model MEPhos developed for the mid-European site conditions was transferred and adapted for a representative study area in Turkey, the Porsuk reservoir catchment. Adaption included the development of a model approach to consider the P input into surface waters from septic tanks. For this purpose, several field campaigns were carried out to define characteristic P emission coefficients for septic tanks. In addition, the soil phosphorus content of the top soil was defined to generate reliable input data for the modelling of the P input into surface water via soil erosion in agricultural areas. According to the MEPhos model results, mean annual <b>phosphorous</b> <b>loads</b> of all types of point sources dominate with a percentage of around 57 %. Erosion contributes to 40 % of the total P load and displays the most significant diffuse input pathway. The validation studies conducted between 2007 and 2011 showed a satisfying agreement with the observed values. After validation, the efficiency of measures to reduce P inputs into the Porsuk reservoir was analysed. It was found that most measures to prevent soil erosion seem to be appropriate, whereas measures to reduce P input from point sources seem to be less efficien...|$|R
40|$|Decomposition of {{leaf litter}} {{plays a major}} role in carbon and {{nutrient}} cycling and in fuelling food webs. Environmental conditions may influence decomposition rates directly by influencing rates of biological reactions, and indirectly by influencing consumer communities. This study assessed how climate influences the relationship between estuarine nutrient enrichment and decomposition. Eelgrass (Zostera muelleri) and mangrove (Avicennia marina) leaves from a common source were deployed within two estuaries with anthropogenically enhanced and two with largely unmodified nutrient loadings, at each of two temperate latitudes of New South Wales, Australia. The latitudes were separated by ~ 1000 km and differed in mean water temperature by ~ 2 °C. Mass loss of litter was assessed after 13, 27 and 65 days, and the invertebrate communities colonizing the bags were censused at 13 and 65 days. At the end of the experiment, mass loss of seagrass blades was greater in nutrient enriched estuaries of the lower latitude than in higher latitude estuaries or those that were relatively unmodified. Mass loss of mangrove leaves was greater in the low latitude or nutrient enriched estuaries than in the largely unmodified estuaries of the higher latitude. Aspects of the abiotic environment, in particular temperature and <b>phosphorous</b> <b>loading,</b> were key correlates of litter mass loss, with only weak relationships between mass loss and macroinvertebrate communities. These results suggest that the sensitivity of decomposition processes to estuarine modification may be dependent on climatic setting, and the dominant litter resources present. Manipulative experiments are now needed to confirm the environmental conditions under which nutrient impacts on decomposition are exacerbated. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{behaviour}} of primary producers in coastal lagoons due to changes of external control parameters—phosphorous external load and maximum tidal flow rate—is investigated {{by using a}} eutrophication model. The eutrophication model allows the simulation of the temporal evolution of the concentration of the following species: a) in the water column: dissolved oxygen, vegetal organic carbon, particulate and dissolved organic carbon, dissolved phosphorous and hydrogen sulphide; b) in sediments: dissolved oxygen, particulate and dissolved organic carbon, dissolved and adsorbed phosphorous, hydrogen sulphide. The vegetal organic carbon is distinguished in three components related to the main groups of primary producers, namely eelgrass, macroalgae and microalgae, having different modalities of nutrient uptake and kinetics parameters depending on the S/V ratio. Diagrams representing the ecosystem dynamic response to the changes of the control parameters were constructed by simulations. The response diagrams suggest the existence of regime shifts which border different ecosystem stability ranges, characterized by the dominance of a specific group of primary producers and by different ecosystem vulnerability at summer water anoxia. A catastrophic bifurcation or abrupt regime shift—evidenced by Poincar`e sections obtained mapping, at a prefixed time period, {{the values of the}} concentration of the species—occurs for a critical value of the control parameter and manifests itself as an abrupt change of the dominant species from eelgrass to macroalgae. An analogous abrupt change from eelgrass to macroalgae occurs for a critical value of the tidal flowrate assumed as control parameter in simulations conducted for an assigned value of external <b>phosphorous</b> <b>load...</b>|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{behaviour}} of a lagoon ecosystem is investigated {{by using an}} eutrophication model. The <b>phosphorous</b> external <b>load</b> is assumed as control parameter. The response diagram, obtained by simulation, varying the value of control parameter, shows the existence of different ranges of stability of the ecosystem, characterized by the dominance of a specific group of primary produces and by a different ecosystem vulnerability to Summer water anoxia. A catastrophic bifurcation occurs for a critical value of the control parameter, which manifests as an abrupt change of the dominant specie from eelgrass to macroalgae. The serious consequences of such a selection in terms of eutrophication processes, anoxic crisis vulnerability and management policies for ecosystems subject to alternate states are emphasised...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{lakes and}} rivers in urban areas suffer from {{excessive}} loading of phosphorus carried by stormwater runoff. This excess phosphorous results in undesirable conditions in these water bodies including bloom of algae and eutrophication. Rain gardens and sand filters can remove contaminants such as heavy metals and sediments. However, they are not effective in removing phosphorous. One new method to remove phosphorous from stormwater runoff is through the implementation of iron enhanced rain gardens. In this best management practice, the sand layer in a rain garden is mixed with iron shavings at a 5 % by weight. The purpose of this project is to develop computer models to simulate the phosphorous removal process of rain gardens. The project involves researching the chemical and physical parameters of the different elements of rain gardens and their interaction with the different forms of phosphorous. These characteristics {{will be used to}} build graphical and numerical models of rain gardens. Two models; the first representing a traditional rain garden and the second representing an iron enhanced rain garden are developed. COMSOL Multiphysics®, an advance finite element analysis software will be used to solve the numerical models. Experimental data will be used to calibrate the computer models. The models can then be used to study or predict the removal efficiencies of rain gardens under different <b>phosphorous</b> <b>loading</b> conditions without the need for conducting further field or laboratory experimentation studies. Upon verification that the model accurately reflects the phosphorous removal, it can then be used as a tool to assist in the design of similar rain gardens for phosphorous removal applications...|$|R
40|$|Excess {{of organic}} matter and {{nutrients}} in water promotes eutrophication process bserved in the Ardila River. It was classified as much polluted being critical for Alqueva-Pedrogão System. The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate the transported nutrients loads in a transboundary watershed using the SWAT (soil and water assessment tool) model and to determine the contribution of nutrients load in the entire watershed. Ardila watershed is about 3, 711 km 2 extended from Spain (78 %) to the eastern part of Portugal (22 %). It was discretized into 32 sub-basins using automated delineation routine, and 174 hydrologic response units. Monthly average meteorological data (from 1947 to 1998) were used to generate daily values through the weather generator Model incorporated in SWAT. Real daily precipitation (from 1931 to 2003) was introduced. The model was calibrated and verified for flow (from 1950 to 2000) and nutrients (from 1981 to 1999). Model performance was evaluated using statistical parameters, such as NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency) and root mean square error (R 2). Calibration and verification flow results showed a satisfactory agreement between simulated and measured monthly date from 1962 to 1972 (NSE = 0. 8; R 2 = 0. 9). The results showed that the most important diffuse pollution comes from the two the main tributary (Spain). The estimated nitrogen and <b>phosphorous</b> <b>loads</b> contribution per year was respectively 72 % and 59 % in Spain and 28 % and 41 % in Portugal. The SWAT model was revealed to be a useful tool for an integrated water management approach that might be improved taking into count the WFD (water framework directive) ...|$|R
40|$|Transformation of the {{phosphorous}} {{compounds in}} Lake Balaton {{was described in}} the mathematical model BALSECT (Balaton Sector Model). This model, which deals with five types of phosphorous compounds [...] dissolved inorganic P, dissolved organic P, nonliving particulate organic P, bacterial P, and phytoplankton P [...] reflects the basic interactions between these compounds {{in accordance with the}} consecutive conversion of phosphorous compounds in the water environment. The rates of change in the phosphorous transformation processes are modeled to be dependent on and regulated by environmental factors such as temperature, radiation, water balance, and nutrient watershed load. The model also takes into account the wind action on the horizontal interbasin transport of phosphorus as well as phosphorous exchange between sediment and water. The measurements of temperature, radiation, wind, water balance, and <b>phosphorous</b> <b>loading</b> were used to examine the feasibility of the model in reproducing the phosphorous dynamics in the fourth basin of Lake Balaton for the environmental conditions of 1976 - 1978. The improved version of the possible watershed nutrient loading was used in this study. On the basis of the analysis of the turnover time values, the details of the cycling of the individual phosphorous compounds and the total P are presented in this report. The explanation of the trends in the phosphorous cycling in the terms of turnover time is considered useful and important for understanding the regime of the phosphorous transformation within the Lake Balaton Ecosystem for the different environmental conditions and changeable nutrient loading. Thus, the simulation results and calculated values of turnover time may be used for the formulation of suggestions concerning the water quality management of this lake...|$|R
