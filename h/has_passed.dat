5|$|A merging draft, BioCode, was {{published}} in 1997 {{in an attempt to}} standardize nomenclature in these three areas, but has yet to be formally adopted.

A revised BioCode that, instead of replacing the existing codes, would provide a unified context for them, was proposed in 2011. However, the International Botanical Congress of 2011 declined to consider the BioCode proposal. The ICVCN remains outside the BioCode, which does not include viral classification.|$|E

Standing {{water can}} cause the spread of disease, and {{transportation}} or communication infrastructure may have been destroyed, hampering clean-up and rescue efforts. Nearly two million people have died globally due to tropical cyclones. Despite their devastating effects, tropical cyclones are also beneficial, by potentially bringing rain to dry areas and moving heat from the tropics poleward. Out at sea, ships {{take advantage of their}} known characteristics by navigating through their weaker, western half.|$|E

An amnesty for possession and usage of these drugs was in effect until October 2008, at which point they became completely illegal.|$|E

While the Brahmin was being taken for cremation, his widow bowed down to Tulsidas on the way who addressed her as Saubhagyavati (a woman whose husband is alive). The widow told Tulsidas her husband had just died, so his words could not be true. Tulsidas said that the word <b>has</b> <b>passed</b> his lips and so he would restore the dead man to life. He asked everybody present to close their eyes and uttered the name of lord Rama, on doing which the dead Brahmin was raised back to life.|$|E

5|$|In the United Kingdom, a bill is {{presented}} for royal assent after it <b>has</b> <b>passed</b> all the required stages {{in both the}} House of Commons and the House of Lords.

Officially, assent is granted by the sovereign or by Lords Commissioners authorised to act by letters patent. It may be granted in parliament or outside parliament; in the latter case, each house must be separately notified before the bill takes effect.|$|E

5|$|Originally, NY5 entered Buffalo {{from the}} south on Fuhrmann Boulevard and Michigan Avenue and {{followed}} South Park Avenue and Main Street through the city before rejoining its modern alignment at Goodell Street. In the mid-1950s, a new limited-access highway was constructed along Fuhrmann Boulevard from Lackawanna to the Buffalo River. At the river, the new roadway broke from Fuhrmann and continued directly into downtown, returning to grade level two blocks south of Niagara Square. The expressway, known as the Buffalo Skyway, became part of a rerouted NY5 by 1956. Visually, the Skyway cuts off the city from the Buffalo inner harbor. In 2008, there was momentum to tear it down, but the momentum <b>has</b> <b>passed.</b>|$|E
