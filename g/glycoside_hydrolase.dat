25|$|Lactase (also {{known as}} lactase-phlorizin hydrolase, or LPH), {{a part of}} the β-galactosidase family of enzymes, is a <b>glycoside</b> <b>hydrolase</b> {{involved}} in the hydrolysis of the disaccharide lactose into constituent galactose and glucose monomers. Lactase is present predominantly along the brush border membrane of the differentiated enterocytes lining the villi of the small intestine. In humans, lactase is encoded by the LCT gene.|$|E

In three species studied, Cephalotus follicularis, Nepenthes alata and Sarracenia purpurea, {{there has been}} convergence at the molecular level. Carnivorous plants secrete enzymes into the digestive fluid they produce. By studying phosphatase, <b>glycoside</b> <b>hydrolase,</b> glucanase, [...] RNAse and chitinase enzymes {{as well as a}} pathogenesis-related protein and a thaumatin-related protein, [...] the authors found many convergent amino acid substitutions. These changes were not at the enzymes' catalytic sites, but rather on the exposed surfaces of the proteins, where they might interact with other components of the cell or the digestive fluid. The authors also found that homologous genes in the non-carnivorous plant Arabidopsis thaliana tend to have their expression increased when the plant is stressed, leading the authors to suggest that stress-responsive proteins have often been co-opted in the repeated evolution of carnivory.|$|E
2500|$|The {{metabolism}} of {{amino acids}} and breakdown of sugars by yeasts {{has the effect}} of creating other biochemical compounds that can contribute to the flavor and aroma of wine. These compounds can be considered [...] "volatile" [...] like aldehydes, ethyl acetate, ester, fatty acids, fusel oils, hydrogen sulfide, ketones [...] and mercaptans or [...] "non-volatile" [...] like glycerol, acetic acid and succinic acid. Yeast also has the effect during fermentation of releasing <b>glycoside</b> <b>hydrolase</b> which can hydrolyse the flavor precursors of aliphatics (a flavor component that reacts with oak), benzene derivatives, monoterpenes (responsible for floral aromas from grapes like Muscat and Traminer), norisoprenoids (responsible for some of the spice notes in Chardonnay), and phenols.|$|E
