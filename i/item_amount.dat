40|$|The {{classical}} statistical correlation is {{an efficient}} technique for linking simple numerical data sets via a single correlation coefficient. The modem schemes for money laundering, financial fraud are becoming very sophisticated and are changed all the time. To {{be able to}} discover such schemes we need to deal simultaneously with a diverse set of numeric and non-numeric data types that include different numeric data types, ordered sets, graph structures, texts, schemes, plans, and other information. Often any individual evidence does not reveal a suspicious pattern and does not guide investigation in forensic accounting. In contrast correlation {{of two or more}} evidences with each other and background knowledge can reveal a suspicious pattern. A new area of Link Discovery (LD) emerged recently is a promising new area for such tasks. This paper outlines design of such a new technique called Hybrid Evidence Correlation (HEC). It combines first-order logic (FOL), probabilistic semantic inference (PSI) and negative rules for designing HEC to deal with rare suspicious patterns. The approach is illustrated with an example of discovery of suspicious patterns. Computational efficiency of the algorithm is justified by a computational experiment. Conceptual advantages of the algorithm such as completeness have been reported in previous mathematical analysis of the base concepts of the algorithm. The approach was successfully tested for detecting transactions fraud on synthetic data.

40|$|In certain {{academic}} systems, {{a student}} can enroll for an exam {{immediately after the}} end of the teaching period or can postpone it to any later examination session, so that the grade is missing until the exam is not attempted. We propose an approach for the evaluation in itinere of a student's proficiency accounting also for non-attempted exams. The approach is based on considering each exam as an item, so that responding to the <b>item</b> <b>amounts</b> to attempting the exam, and on an Item Response Theory model that includes two latent variables corresponding to the student's ability and the propensity to attempt the exam. In this way, we explicitly account for non-ignorable missing observations as the indicators of item response also contribute to measure the ability. The two latent variables are assumed to have a discrete distribution defining latent classes of students that are homogeneous in terms of ability and priority assigned to exams. The model, which also allows for individual covariates in its structural part, is fitted by the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. The approach is illustrated through the analysis of data about the first-year exams of freshmen of the School of Economics at the University of Florence (Italy).

Methods: All students (n = 289) were invited to take part of the study, and 207 (71. 63 %) effectively participated, being 152 (73. 4 %) females. At the day of data collection, the students answered The Dental Environmental Stress Questionnaire (DES) and unstimulated saliva samples were collected for determination of salivary flow rate and SIgA concentration and secretion rate. Results: Mean DES scores were higher in females (78. 97 ± 16. 42), but no correlations between the sum of DES scores and salivary parameters were observed (P= 0. 08). A moderate inverse relationship was observed between SIgA secretion rates and the subscales Academic Performance (P= 0. 01), Interpersonal relationships (P= 0. 02) and Difficulties and Insecurities about Professional Future (P= 0. 05).
