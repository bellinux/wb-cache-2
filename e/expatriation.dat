5|$|The Court found {{support for}} its {{position}} {{in the history of the}} unratified Titles of Nobility Amendment. The fact that this 1810 proposal had been framed as a constitutional amendment, rather than an ordinary act of Congress, was seen by the majority as showing that, even before the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress did not believe that it had the power to revoke anyone's citizenship. The Court further noted that a proposed 1818 act of Congress would have provided a way for citizens to voluntarily relinquish their citizenship, but opponents had argued that Congress had no authority to provide for <b>expatriation.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{propensity}} of using expatriates as {{one type of}} international transfer assignees {{in the context of}} service offshoring operations. It proposes a theoretical framework that explains the choice of using expatriates {{as a function of the}} five main characteristics of offshoring projects: the objectives pursued with offshoring - cost savings, service and process improvement, or innovation and learning -, the type of task offshored - more or less advanced -, the host country risks – the inter-firm relationship or the environmental uncertainty to the offshoring firm -, the offshore governance mode - captive or outsourcing -, and the size of the project. The framework also incorporates firm level moderating factors that are experience (with offshoring and with <b>expatriations)</b> and size. Research propositions provide a framework for companies and researchers to approach international transfer assignment decisions for service offshoring activities in a more systematic way. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{international}} {{tax reform}} proposal introduced by Sen. Max Baucus (D-MT) on November 19, 2013 contains several significant innovations {{that promise to}} define {{the terms of the}} debate for the foreseeable political future. It is therefore worth examining in detail even if it seems unlikely that progress toward meaningful reform can be achieved very soon. The major component of the proposal is a move toward territoriality coupled with two alternative anti-profit shifting options, option Y and option Z. This article will argue that option Y represents a significant step forward and can be the basis of adopting a territorial regime, while option Z is deeply flawed and risks further profit shifting unconstrained by the current limits on repatriating profits. Other important innovations in the Baucus proposal include a new destination based tax on Controlled Foreign Corporations (CFCs) on their sale of goods and services into the US; a major modification of the PFIC rules and other simplification measures; and a significant rollback of the portfolio interest exemption. This article will analyze each of these elements of the proposal and then offer some suggestions for further improvement. The two major missing elements from the proposal are additional broad limitations on inbound base erosion and preventative measures against corporate <b>expatriations...</b>|$|R
40|$|Washington Irving’s collection, The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. (1819 - 20), {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} and most influential texts to have achieved acclaim {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic. Its most famous stories, which include “Rip Van Winkle” and “The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,” are considered to be classics in their own right and are still popular. At the heart of the collection, however, is its narrator Geoffrey Crayon, a New Yorker travelling to England, and especially London, for the first time in order to experience its grand museums and libraries, its stunning architecture, and the sedate yet rarified country house lifestyle of the landed gentry: in short, all of the things he could not have experienced in contemporary America. Once in England, however, Crayon is struck by his increasing feelings of exile and loneliness, and retreats into his artistic intentions as solace. Notably, the collection’s most enduring stories in the collection are set in America: even as Crayon distances himself physically from his homeland he is drawn to it as an artistic subject, as though he cannot really see America until he leaves it. This feeling of artistic exile, as presented in The Sketch Book, is strikingly modern in tone for a text which is over 170 years old, and not only precedes later literary <b>expatriations</b> but anticipates developments in narrative studies, with respect to short-story theory and the composite novel. Irving negotiates the preferences, assumptions, and historical experience of each audience by steeping his social and cultural criticism in the universal realms of storytelling and mythology. In an age of emergent cultural nationalism, Irving seeks to establish both himself and his narrator as transatlantic writers. His desire to craft a truly transatlantic work, however, becomes a blatantly pastoral act, which turns the very presence of narrative into an anachronism. In our own time of emergent cultural nationalism, recent critical revival of Irving has explored his position as a postcolonial writer, but without the fullest realization of the narrative theories that bring to the fore precisely how Irving’s work manages the diverse needs of its transatlantic audiences, or without much consideration of its fictive author. A reading of specifically transnational sketches from The Sketch-Book from the perspective of contemporary narrative theory, but informed by their place in time, identifies and foregrounds the significance of the sociopolitical narrativity and literary pastoralism that emerges from Irving’s – and Crayon’s – transatlanticism...|$|R

25|$|Senator Joe Lieberman, a Connecticut {{independent}} {{and chairman of}} the Senate Homeland Security Committee, introduced bipartisan legislation under which Americans joining or working with foreign terrorist groups would be stripped of their U.S. citizenship. Identical legislation is being introduced in the United States House of Representatives by Pennsylvania Congressmen, Jason Altmire, a Democrat, and Charlie Dent, a Republican. Lawmakers said that revoking citizenship would block terrorism suspects from using U.S. passports to re-enter the U.S., and make them eligible for prosecution before a military commission instead of a civilian court. The measure, named the Terrorist <b>Expatriation</b> Act, was immediately criticized by Muslim advocacy groups, who said it would unjustly target Muslim Americans and other minority groups. “In my opinion it is xenophobic and unconstitutional and un-American,” said Mahdi Bray, executive director of the Muslim American Society. The bill is an amendment to a 1940 law which stripped citizenship from individuals who joined either Japanese or German armies.|$|E
25|$|The Convention {{featured}} fierce debates, {{the arguments}} raged throughout Virginia {{in the press}} and they were widely reported nationally. Direct popular election of governor was supported by Whig Congressman John Minor Botts. He was opposed by Richmond Junta Democrat Richard L.T. Beale who argued against the natural equality of all men, and the “plundering propensities” of the multitude seeking a “majority of mere numbers”. Although for direct election of Governor, Henry A. Wise was more fearful of the eastern slave-holders loss of control in the General Assembly. He believed that “protection of slavery, not the liberalizing of Virginia’s Constitution, was the most significant business before the convention.” Albert G. Pendleton suggested that nearly 100,000 citizens of the western counties were disenfranchised by the 1830 Constitution, and that malapportionment led to the lack of internal improvements needed in west. Muscoe R.H. Garnett opposed expanding the franchise to prohibit internal improvements that might benefit the western counties. James Barbour objected to extending the franchise to white westerners because support for outright emancipation had originated from there in the past. Even with proposals for freed slave <b>expatriation</b> to Africa, Barbour doubted any assurances from the west for the long run preservation of slavery.|$|E
500|$|Ever {{since the}} {{affirmation}} by Congress, in the <b>Expatriation</b> Act of 1868, that individuals had an inherent right to <b>expatriation</b> (giving up of citizenship), it {{has historically been}} accepted that certain actions could result in loss of citizenship.

The dissenters argued that the principle of jus sanguinis (that is, the concept of a child inheriting his or her father's citizenship by descent regardless of birthplace) had been more pervasive in U.S. legal history since independence.

500|$|Fabulous Histories (later {{known as}} The Story of the Robins), Trimmer's most popular work, was first {{published}} in 1786, and remained in print until the beginning of the 20th century. It tells the story of two families, a robin family and a human family, who learn to live together congenially. Most importantly, the human children and the baby robins must learn to adopt virtue and to shun vice. For Trimmer, practising kindness to animals as a child would hopefully lead one to [...] "universal benevolence" [...] as an adult. According to Samuel Pickering, Jr., a scholar of 18th-century children's literature, [...] "in its depiction of 18th-century attitudes toward animals, Mrs. Trimmer’s Fabulous Histories was the most representative children’s book of the period". [...] The text expresses most of the themes that would come to dominate Trimmer's later works, such as her emphasis on retaining social hierarchies; as Tess Cosslett, a scholar of children's literature explains, [...] "the notion of hierarchy that underpins Fabulous Histories is relatively stable and fixed. Parents are above children in terms of authority, and humans above animals, in terms both of dominion and compassion: poor people should be fed before hungry animals… [...] the hierarchical relation of men and women is not so clearly enforced." [...] Moira Ferguson, a scholar of the 18th and 19th centuries, places these themes in a larger historical context, arguing that [...] "the fears of the author and her class about an industrial revolution in ascendance and its repercussions are evident. Hence, [...] text attacks cruelty to birds and animals while affirming British aggression abroad. [...] …The text subtly opts for conservative solutions: maintenance of order and established values, resignation and compliance from the poor at home, <b>expatriation</b> for foreigners who do not assimilate easily." [...] A second overarching theme in the text is rationality; Trimmer expresses the common fear of the power of fiction in her preface, explaining to her childish readers that her fable is not real and that animals cannot really speak. Like many social critics during the 18th century, Trimmer was concerned about fiction's potentially damaging impact on young readers. With the rise of the novel and its concomitant private reading, there was a great fear that young people and especially women would read racy and adventurous stories without the knowledge of their parents and, perhaps even more worrisome, interpret the books as they pleased. Trimmer therefore always referred to her text as Fabulous Histories and never as The Story of the Robins in order to emphasize its reality; moreover, she did not allow the book to be illustrated within her lifetime—pictures of talking birds would only have reinforced the paradox of the book (it was fiction parading as a history). Yarde has also speculated that most of the characters in the text are drawn from Trimmer's own acquaintances and family.|$|E
