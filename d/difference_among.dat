25|$|The city {{experiences}} {{the most prominent}} <b>difference</b> <b>among</b> seasons and between temperature extremes among all Brazilian capitals. One {{reason for that is}} the highest latitude, which also contributes for the occurrence of 14 hours of daylight in December and 10 hours in June. The population is occasionally dangerously exposed to extremely high UV radiation.|$|E
25|$|According to Ehrman, a more {{important}} <b>difference</b> <b>among</b> the Gospels is with the book of John. He argues that the concept that Jesus existed before his birth, was a divine being, and became human is only claimed in the Gospel of John. However, most scholars disagree, locating pre-existent and divine Christology within the Pauline epistles and synoptic gospels.|$|E
25|$|Slovenia {{is among}} the European {{countries}} with the most pronounced ageing of population, ascribable to a low birth rate and increasing life expectancy. Almost all Slovenian inhabitants older than 64 are retired, with {{no significant difference between}} the genders. The working-age group is diminishing in spite of immigration. The proposal to raise the retirement age from the current 57 for women and 58 for men was rejected in a referendum in 2011. In addition, the <b>difference</b> <b>among</b> the genders regarding life expectancy is still significant. The total fertility rate (TFR) in 2014 was estimated at 1.33 children born/woman, which is lower than the replacement rate of 2.1. The majority of children are born to unmarried women (in 2016, 58.6% of all births were outside of marriage).|$|E

25|$|The area {{is part of}} {{the slopes}} around the Popocatépetl volcano. The highest {{elevations}} are in the north, descending gradually to the south, east and west. Major elevations include Yoteco (2110 masl), Boyero (1824 masl) and Mirador (1882 masl). There are formations of volcanic rock, including basalt. Surface water consists of runoff from Popocateptl into streams and small rivers, many of which have formed deep ravines such as the one named Yecapixtla, which begins in the State of Mexico and passes through Zahuatlán and Mexquemeca. before emptying into the Cuautla River. Other streams include Arcos de Ortiz, Malpaso or La Cuera and Del Negro. Other named ravines in the territory include Xococotla, Atlamaxa, Las Animas, Tepanche, Xalpa, Tamalera, and Remudadero. There are also a number of fresh water springs such as Chirimoyo, Las Pilas, La Tenería, La Mora, and Tepetlapa. In general, climate is warm and humid with rains falling principally from June to October. Average temperature is 19.6C, and annual rainfall is between 800 and 1000mm. There is little <b>difference</b> <b>among</b> the seasons in temperature. Overall, the north tends to be somewhat cooler than the south due to altitude. Much of the municipality is covered in pine and holm oak forest, with some other species such as amate (a type of fig) tree, casahuates and guamuchiles. Most other vegetation is deciduous. Most of the area’s wildlife has been extinguished with only various insects and reptiles to be found wild.|$|E
500|$|A heated {{nomination}} battle emerged between Clinton and Barack Obama. Ferraro became livid and distraught {{when one}} of her daughters voted for Obama in the Massachusetts primary, saying [...] "What is the matter with you? You know Hillary. You have seen my involvement with her." [...] When her daughter responded by noting that Obama was inspirational, Ferraro snapped, [...] "What does he inspire you to do, leave your husband and three kids and your practice and go work for Doctors Without Borders?" [...] This {{was seen as an}} example of a generational <b>difference</b> <b>among</b> American women; in contrast to Ferraro's generation, younger women saw nothing special about electing a woman president (especially one with Clinton's past history) compared to what writer Anne Kornblut called [...] "the milestone of electing an African American president". According to Kornblut, younger voters saw [...] "Clinton [...] both a relic of that era and a victim of its success. She was the wrong woman at the wrong time; she was a Clinton; she hadn't gotten there on her own".|$|E
500|$|William S. Andrews of Syracuse was a 69-year-old judge, {{noted for}} his scholarship, {{who had been}} on the Court of Appeals since 1917. The son of Charles Andrews, a former Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, William Andrews is best remembered today because he wrote an opinion in Palsgraf. In that dissent, he was joined by Judges Frederick E. Crane and John F. O'Brien. Andrews began with a brief recitation of facts: that a {{railroad}} employee had negligently dislodged the package, the contents of which the trainman was unaware, and the subsequent explosion broke the scale and injured the plaintiff, [...] "an intending passenger". Andrews noted the fundamental <b>difference</b> <b>among</b> the judges concerning the law of negligence: whether there must be a duty to the plaintiff, the breach of which injured her, and whether, when there is an act that is a threat to the safety of others, the doer of it should be [...] "liable for all its proximate consequences, even where they result in injury to one who would generally be thought to be outside the radius of danger". Andrews believed that if there was a negligent act, the proximate cause of injury to the plaintiff, that should establish liability.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the final}} week of the election, several polls had Price ahead.

Burkhalter and McCallum {{were not on the}} final ballot. On July 11, 2004, a televised debate was held between the remaining candidates. The election was then held on July 20. While early voting results showed Lamutt in the lead, Price overtook him {{by the end of the}} night and finished in first with 35% of the vote. Lamutt came in second, earning 28% of the vote, and Clay took third with 21% of the vote. Because Price failed to earn over 50% of the vote, a run-off election between him and Lamutt was scheduled for August 10.|$|E
2500|$|President Richard Nixon made an unannounced {{visit to}} Xenia {{a few days}} later. It {{would be the first}} (and only) city {{affected}} by the 1974 Super Outbreak that he would visit. Upon inspecting the damage, he said: [...] "As I look back over the disasters, I saw the earthquake in Anchorage in 1964; I saw the hurricanes... Hurricane Camille in 1969 down in Mississippi, and I saw Hurricane Agnes in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. And it is hard to tell the <b>difference</b> <b>among</b> them all, but I would say in terms of destruction, just total devastation, this is the worst I have seen." [...] President Nixon immediately declared Xenia a disaster area. Although the Federal Disaster Relief Act was already introduced in 1973, it still had not passed Congress. The 1974 Super Outbreak disaster was a catalyst for accelerated passage of the act through Congress in 1974, according to Nixon. It took several months for the city to recover from the tornado, {{with the help of the}} Red Cross and the Ohio National Guard assisting the recovery efforts. Most of the town was quickly re-built afterward. In recognition of their coverage of the tornado under difficult circumstances, the staff of the Xenia Daily Gazette won the Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Reporting in 1975. The Xenia tornado was one of two rated F5 that affected Ohio during the outbreak, the other striking the Cincinnati area (see Cincinnati/Sayler Park area tornado, below). [...] Xenia was later struck by two other tornadoes—both a smaller one in April 1989 and a larger one in September 2000, which was an F4 twister that killed one and injured about 100 in an area parallel to and just north of the 1974 path. Before the 1974 storm, the city had no tornado sirens. After the F5 tornado hit on April 3, 1974, ten sirens were installed across the area.|$|E
