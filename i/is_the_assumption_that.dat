Methods and resultsThe Taiwanese cohort of RIAT consisted of 8922 patients with untreated/uncontrolled essential hypertension recruited from 22 centers in the country. At the first visit, physicians selected target BP and antihypertensive treatment, and at the next three visits they measured BP and modified treatment/provided justification for not modifying treatment. Mean target BP selected by physicians was 134. 6 / 84. 6  ±  5. 1 / 5. 0  mmHg, respectively. Patients’ individual risk stratification determined the BP goals. More patients achieved targets according to the physicians’ opinion than based on actual BP measurements: visit 2 – 50. 6 % vs. 48. 6 %; visit 3 – 58. 4 % vs. 55. 2 %; and visit 4 – 61. 2 % vs. 57. 0 %. At each visit, treatment remained unchanged for > 60 % patients not reaching target; the most common reason for this at visit 2 <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> time <b>was</b> too short to assess new drug therapy and at visits 3 and 4 <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> target <b>was</b> reached/had almost been reached. ConclusionAbout 40 % Taiwanese hypertensive patients in RIAT did not reach BP targets after an average of 4 months’ follow-up.

25|$|As {{a result}} of {{multiple}} male mating, multiple paternities were observed in species as {{a result of}} convenience polyandry. Convenience Polyandry Hypothesis <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> there is a greater cost for females when, refusing male mating attempts than in choice mating. It is the situation in which females adjust their mating rate to balance the costs of male harassment. It has been suggested that convenience polyandry would increase when females are weaker than males, decreasing the costs of sexual aggression. Convenience polyandry is seen in several arthropod species, like water striders (Gerris buenoi).|$|E
25|$|A common {{method to}} achieve this is the self-consistent {{multiple}} scattering approach. One essential point in this approach <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> the scattering properties of the surface, i.e. of the individual atoms, are known in detail. The main task then reduces to {{the determination of the}} effective wave field incident on the individual scatters present in the surface, where the effective field is the sum of the primary field and the field emitted from all the other atoms. This must be done in a self-consistent way, since the emitted field of an atom depends on the incident effective field upon it. Once the effective field incident on each atom is determined, the total field emitted from all atoms can be found and its asymptotic value far from the crystal then gives the desired intensities.|$|E
25|$|Another key {{concept in}} social {{cognition}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> reality is too complex to easily discern. As a result, {{we tend to}} see the world according to simplified schemas or images of reality. Schemas are generalized mental representations that organize knowledge and guide information processing. Schemas often operate automatically and unintentionally, and can lead to biases in perception and memory. Expectations from schemas may lead us to see something that is not there. One experiment found that {{people are more likely to}} misperceive a weapon in the hands of a black man than a white man. This type of schema is actually a stereotype, a generalized set of beliefs about a particular group of people (when incorrect, an ultimate attribution error). Stereotypes are often related to negative or preferential attitudes (prejudice) and behavior (discrimination). Schemas for behaviors (e.g., going to a restaurant, doing laundry) are known as scripts.|$|E

25|$|An {{oversight}} in {{the application}} of the no-hair theorem <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> the relevant degrees of freedom accounting for the entropy of the black hole must be classical in nature; what if they were purely quantum mechanical instead and had non-zero entropy? Actually, this is what is realized in the LQG derivation of black hole entropy, and {{can be seen as a}} consequence of its background-independence – the classical black hole spacetime comes about from the semiclassical limit of the quantum state of the gravitational field, but there are many quantum states that have the same semiclassical limit. Specifically, in LQG it is possible to associate a quantum geometrical interpretation to the microstates: These are the quantum geometries of the horizon which are consistent with the area, , of the black hole and the topology of the horizon (i.e. spherical). LQG offers a geometric explanation of the finiteness of the entropy and of the proportionality of the area of the horizon. These calculations have been generalized to rotating black holes.|$|E
500|$|Official {{municipal}} boundaries were first drawn up in 1832 in the Netherlands after a cadastre was formed. The Municipalities Act of 1851, written by prime minister Thorbecke, {{led to the}} disappearance of small municipalities. Throughout the years, less populous municipalities have been merged. They were either added to the larger neighbouring cities or multiple smaller municipalities merged into a larger new municipality with a new name. The number of municipalities reduced from 1,209 in 1850 to 537 in 2000; [...] there are 388 municipalities. During this time, multiple mergers occurred simultaneously in large parts of individual provinces; the {{municipal boundaries}} were basically redrawn in these regions. In the 19th and {{large parts of the}} 20th century, municipal mergers were forced by the central government. This policy changed in the end of the 20th century; local support for the merger is now {{a large part of the}} decision-making process. The larger, merged municipalities are intended to handle an increasing workload because more public services are delegated from higher levels of government to the municipalities. Another reason for municipal mergers <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>assumption</b> <b>that</b> larger municipalities are more efficient in performing their tasks than smaller ones.|$|E
