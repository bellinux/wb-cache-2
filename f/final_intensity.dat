40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between reproductive behaviour and working career of {{the woman on the}} basis on data deriving from the Fertility Survey carried out in Italy in 1995 / 96. In the Italian context, characterised both by the fertility in the world and a low women participation to the labour force, the study of the dynamic relationship between fertility and work participation is very relevant, considering the complex development of the Italian society, both for the women and labour market condition. By means of a logistic multilevel multiple-spell duration model, our analysis shows that the educational/work process influences the timing of the transition to motherhood: women tend to bear their first child after the conclusion of the educational process. Moreover, having a job after this process represents a cause of a greater delay in the moment of child bearing, but the <b>final</b> <b>intensity</b> of the process is quite similar whatever is the educational /working pattern. &# 13; The working path changes both the timing and the <b>final</b> <b>intensity</b> of the second child, and these effects are quite different in the North, Centre and South of Italy.

For this purpose, the rendering is accomplished on GPU by using OpenGL’s Framebuffer Objects. This framework may be useful for interactive educational systems or for medical record printings. ...|$|E

The electron cloud is located at the beam center and up to 1 % of the particles can be trapped by the magnetic field.

40|$|One of {{the factors}} which may limit the {{intensity}} in the Fermilab Recycler is a fast transverse instability. It develops within a hundred turns and, in certain conditions, {{may lead to a}} beam loss. The high rate of the instability suggest that its cause is electron cloud. We studied the phenomena by observing the dynamics of stable and unstable beam, simulating numerically the build-up of the electron cloud, and developed an analytical model of an electron cloud driven instability with the electrons trapped in combined function di-poles. We found that beam motion can be stabilized by a clearing bunch, which confirms the electron cloud nature of the instability. The clearing suggest electron cloud trapping in Recycler combined function mag-nets. Numerical simulations show that up to 1 % of the particles can be trapped by the magnetic field. Since the process of electron cloud build-up is exponential, once trapped this amount of electrons significantly increases the density of the cloud on the next revolution. In a Recycler combined function dipole this multi-turn accumulation allows the electron cloud reaching <b>final</b> <b>intensities</b> orders of magnitude greater than in a pure dipole.

40|$|In this thesis, {{a series}} of (48 - 60 h) {{numerical}} simulations {{of a family of}} frontal cyclogenesis events that occurred over western Atlantic Ocean during 13 - 15 March 1992 are conducted using a nested-grid version of the PSU/NCAR mesoscale model (MM 4) with a fine-mesh grid size of 30 km. It is shown that MM 4 captures very well the genesis, track and intensity of three secondary cyclones, their associated thermal structure and precipitation pattern as well as their surface circulations. It is found that an upper-level potential vorticity (PV) ring {{plays an important role in}} determining the initiation and track of the frontal cyclones. The cyclones appear to form as a consequence of the superposition of upper-level PV anomalies on the low-level intense baroclinicity in the cold sector behind the slow moving primary cold front, and then they propagate into colder air towards the parent cyclone's center. It is also found that as the MFC intensifies, a mesoscale trough is induced in the low-to-middle troposphere, creating a favorable phase lag between the new pressure trough and a slow moving thermal wave. This phase lag provides a baroclinic conversion mechanism by which the system's kinetic energy could increase rapidly at the expense of available potential energy. Diagnosis of sensitivity experiments reveals (i) dry dynamics determines the initiation and track of the frontal cyclones, accounting for about 59 % of the <b>final</b> <b>intensity</b> of the MFC; (ii) the low-level baroclinicity and the upper-level PV anomalies are near-equally important in the genesis of the dry systems; (iii) the Ekman spin-down tends to slow substantially the development of the frontal cyclones; and (iv) surface heat and moisture fluxes could produce a significant impact (i. e., 59 %) on the <b>final</b> <b>intensity</b> of the cyclones in the presence of latent heat release, but its impact is small in the dry dynamical framework.
