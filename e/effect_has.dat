5|$|In {{psychological}} assessments, the birthday-number <b>effect</b> <b>has</b> {{been exploited}} to measure implicit self-esteem. The Number Preference Task {{is often used}} {{in combination with the}} more popular Letter Preference Task, sometimes jointly called the Initials and Birthday Preference Task (IBPT). The most popular method to measure implicit self-esteem is the Implicit Association Test.|$|E
5|$|People who eat a healthy, Japanese, or Mediterranean diet have a {{lower risk}} of AD. A Mediterranean diet may improve {{outcomes}} in those with the disease. Those who eat a diet high in saturated fats and simple carbohydrates (mono- and disaccharide) have a higher risk. The Mediterranean diet's beneficial cardiovascular <b>effect</b> <b>has</b> been proposed as the mechanism of action.|$|E

Compositing desktop <b>effects</b> <b>have</b> been enabled by default where hardware and drivers support them. Automatic checks confirm that compositing works before enabling it on the workspace.|$|R
5|$|Termites use {{sophisticated}} {{means to}} control the temperatures of their mounds. As discussed above, the shape and orientation of the mounds of the Australian compass termite stabilises their internal temperatures during the day. As the towers heat up, the solar chimney effect (stack effect) creates an updraft of air within the mound. Wind blowing across {{the tops of the}} towers enhances the circulation of air through the mounds, which also include side vents in their construction. The solar chimney <b>effect</b> <b>has</b> been in use for centuries in the Middle East and Near East for passive cooling, as well as in Europe by the Romans. It is only relatively recently, however, that climate responsive construction techniques have become incorporated into modern architecture. Especially in Africa, the stack <b>effect</b> <b>has</b> become a popular means to achieve natural ventilation and passive cooling in modern buildings.|$|E
5|$|The birthday-number {{effect is}} the {{unconscious}} tendency {{of people to}} prefer the numbers in the date of their birthday over other numbers. First reported in 1997 by Japanese psychologists Shinobu Kitayama and Mayumi Karasawa, the birthday-number <b>effect</b> <b>has</b> been replicated in various countries. It holds across age and gender. The effect is most prominent for numbers over 12.|$|E

5|$|A woman's {{fertility}} is {{also affected}} by her age. As a woman's total egg supply is formed in fetal life, to be ovulated decades later, {{it has been}} suggested that this long lifetime may make the chromatin of eggs more vulnerable to division problems, breakage, and mutation than the chromatin of sperm, which are produced continuously during a man's reproductive life. However, despite this hypothesis, a similar paternal age <b>effect</b> <b>has</b> also been observed.|$|E
5|$|Antioxidants, such as {{vitamins}} C and E, {{have been}} proposed {{to protect against the}} disease, but results of studies have been contradictory and no positive <b>effect</b> <b>has</b> been proven. The results regarding fat and fatty acids have been contradictory, with various studies reporting protective effects, risk-increasing effects or no effects. There have been preliminary indications that the use of anti-inflammatory drugs and calcium channel blockers may be protective. A 2010 meta-analysis found that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (apart from aspirin), have been associated with at least a 15 percent (higher in long-term and regular users) reduction of incidence of the development of Parkinson's disease.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} abundance, seamounts {{are one of}} the most common marine {{ecosystems}} in the world. Interactions between seamounts and underwater currents, as well as their elevated position in the water, attract plankton, corals, fish, and marine mammals alike. Their aggregational <b>effect</b> <b>has</b> been noted by the commercial fishing industry, and many seamounts support extensive fisheries. There are ongoing concerns on the negative impact of fishing on seamount ecosystems, and well-documented cases of stock decline, for example with the orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus). 95% of ecological damage is done by bottom trawling, which scrapes whole ecosystems off seamounts.|$|E

5|$|Discovered in 1985 by the Belgian {{psychologist}} Jozef Nuttin, the name-letter <b>effect</b> <b>has</b> been {{replicated in}} dozens of studies, involving subjects from over 15 countries, using four different alphabets. It holds across age and gender. People who changed their names many years ago tend to prefer the letters of both their current and original names over non-name letters. The effect is most prominent for initials, but even when initials are excluded, the remaining letters of both given and family names still tend to be preferred over non-name letters.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational {{redshift}} {{was first}} measured {{in a laboratory}} setting in 1959 by Pound and Rebka. It is also seen in astrophysical measurements, notably for light escaping the white dwarf Sirius B. The related gravitational time dilation <b>effect</b> <b>has</b> been measured by transporting atomic clocks to altitudes of between tens {{and tens of thousands}} of kilometers (first by Hafele and Keating in 1971; most accurately to date by Gravity Probe A launched in 1976).|$|E
5|$|In {{psychological}} assessments, the name-letter <b>effect</b> <b>has</b> {{been exploited}} to measure self-esteem. There {{are two types}} of self-esteem: explicit self-esteem (a person's deliberate and conscious evaluation of themselves) and implicit self-esteem. Because by definition implicit self-esteem is not accessible to introspection, measures of it do not rely on direct self-reports but on the degree to which objects associated with the self generate positive versus negative thoughts.|$|E

5|$|Most {{people like}} themselves; the {{birthday}} {{is associated with}} the self, and hence the numbers in the birthday are preferred, {{despite the fact that they}} appear in many other contexts. People who do not like themselves tend not to exhibit the birthday-number effect. A similar effect, the name-letter <b>effect,</b> <b>has</b> been found for letters: people tend to prefer the letters that are part of their name. The birthday-number effect and the name-letter effect are significantly correlated. In psychological assessments, the Number Preference Task is used to estimate implicit self-esteem.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people like}} themselves; {{the name is}} {{associated}} with the self, and hence the letters of the name are preferred, {{despite the fact that they}} appear in many other words. People who do not like themselves tend not to exhibit the name-letter effect. A similar <b>effect</b> <b>has</b> been found for numbers related to birthdays: people tend to prefer the number signifying the day of the month on which they were born. Alternative explanations for the name-letter effect, such as frequent exposure and early mastery, have been ruled out. In psychological assessments, the Name Letter Preference Task is widely used to estimate implicit self-esteem.|$|E
5|$|Nuttin {{frames the}} cause {{in terms of}} ownership, which has roots in {{economic}} psychology. The endowment <b>effect</b> <b>has</b> found that people ascribe more value to things merely because they own them. Nuttin puts the name-letter effect down to people automatically liking and valuing anything that is connected to them. As such, the name-letter effect {{is just one example}} of a more general mere-ownership effect. In which case, various verifiable predictions follow.|$|E

5|$|Recently, a {{population}} of Burmese pythons became established in Everglades National Park. Substantial American alligator populations in the Everglades may be a contributing factor in keeping the python populations low, preventing {{the spread of the}} species up north. While events of predation by Burmese pythons on young alligators have been observed, no evidence of a net negative <b>effect</b> <b>has</b> been seen on overall American alligator populations.|$|E
5|$|Regional airports, such as Edinburgh Airport, have {{experienced}} strong growth in CAT operations in recent years. These operations are commercially and operationally incompatible with GA, {{and although there}} is no evidence of deliberate discrimination, the <b>effect</b> <b>has</b> been to discourage or exclude it. GA aircraft are being subject to significant increases in charges, including the imposition of handling fees in some cases. Some airports restrict or deny GA parking, and others limit or refuse certain GA activity. As a result, light GA aircraft are now rarely or never seen at large, busy international airports such as Heathrow, Stansted, Gatwick and Manchester.|$|E
5|$|Seamounts {{may thus}} be vital {{stopping}} points for some migratory animals, specifically whales. Some recent research indicates whales may use such features as navigational aids throughout their migration. For {{a long time}} it has been surmised that many pelagic animals visit seamounts as well, to gather food, but proof of this aggregating <b>effect</b> <b>has</b> been lacking. The first demonstration of this conjecture was published in 2008.|$|E
