40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{different}} aspects of air movements in building components. The investigation shows to what degree the concept of fluid mechanics {{can be applied to}} problems concerning air flows in building Components. The applicable parts of fluid mechanics are presented as thoroughly as possible. Based on this concept, routines are outlined to make it possible to handle complex flow and pressure distribution problems. Both manual and computer calculation routines are described and the way they can be used is demonstrated in a number of examples. Experimental investigations concerning determination of surface roughness of plates - instead of that of pipes which almost always has been investigated earlier were carried out. A test device for this purpose was designed and tested on a number of building materials. Also magnitudes of contraction and bend loss factors were investigated experimentally. Since, in practice, pressure differences acting across building components are seldom steady the influence of fluctuating pressure differences was investigated theoretically. The analysis shows that rapid fluctuations influence the flow rate only a little. If the fluctuations are slow it is possible to calculate the flow rate as if the problem was a steady state one, using time averaged pressure difference values. Leakaqe characteristics of different building components are reviewed and the air leakage behaviour of whole building envelopes is discussed. The great effect of <b>entrance,</b> <b>bend,</b> exit and orifice pressure losses is emphasized, and their influences on both leakage rate and flow characteristics are shown. An additional part of the so called pressurization test, taking the form of the leakage rate - pressure difference curve into account, is suggested. Such a procedure could imply a new possibility of detecting larqe, and maybe hidden, flow paths giving rise to substantial contributions to the total leakage rate of a building. Some tables are also included. They cover surface roughness, permeability and porosity data of different building materials. An extensive list of references is given...|$|E

Detailed heat transfer coefficient distributions are measured for three different entrance geometries: S-shape <b>entrance,</b> 90 degree <b>bend</b> <b>entrance</b> and a twisted entrance with changing AR. Both smooth and ribbed channels are used in a two pass channel configuration. A baseline straight-entry channel {{is used as a}} reference for comparison. The tests are done for Reynolds number ranging from 15000 to 55000. The ribs are placed at an angle of 45 ° to the mainstream flow. The results show that the effects of entrance geometry persist throughout the first pass (up to a distance of 9 times the hydraulic diameter) for the smooth channel. All the entrance geometries provided enhancement in heat transfer compared to the straight fully developed entrance, with the 90 degree <b>bend</b> <b>entrance</b> providing the highest enhancement. The effect of entrance is less pronounced for the ribbed test section case with the effects confined more in the early developing regions. The 90 degree <b>bend</b> <b>entrance</b> and the twisted-entry cases enhance heat transfer for the ribbed test section, while the S-shape entrance reduces the heat transfer for the ribbed test section relative to the straight entry channel...|$|R

Measurements of velocities and water surface elevations on a dense grid allowed, for the first time, the quantification of fluxes and forces that influence flow structure. Experiments without vegetation showed superelevation of water surface along the outer bank due to centrifugal effects, accompanied by longitudinal variations in water-surface gradients associated with width changes, as the channel was narrower near the bend inflection and wider near the apex.

40|$|A {{brief summary}} of {{conclusions}} drawn from this work is as follows: 1. The coefficient of discharge increases directly as the operating head on a siphon spillway while discharging into deep water, and decreases rapidly with increase of head when discharge is in shallow water and air. The rate of discharge increases with the head, and approaches a nearly constant value for higher heads. Similar tests made on the model without the air trap seal {{has the effect of}} increasing the rate of discharge when discharging into air, and a slight increase of the coefficient of discharge at lower heads. 2. Better means of measuring pressure must be sought, and until then, accurate means of obtaining losses from point to point are not available. A Pitot tube exploration seems the best suggestion. The maximum losses are in the <b>entrance,</b> throat, and <b>bend</b> over the crest. Q = AV does not hold for ordimry piezometer tube measurements, and Bernoulli's theorem may not be applied. 3. The principles of similitude my be applied to the siphon, and the scale factor may be increased to 4, with all characteristics remaining the same. The discharge varies as the five halves power of the scale factor...|$|R
40|$|In the {{previous}} canonical formulation of beam dynamics for an electron bunch moving ultrarelativistically through magnetic bending systems, {{we have shown}} that the transverse dynamics equation for a particle in the bunch has a driving term which behaves as the centrifugal force caused by the particle's initial potential energy due to collective particle interactions within the bunch. As a result, the initial potential energy at the <b>entrance</b> of a <b>bending</b> system, which we call pseudo (kinetic) energy, is indistinguishable from the usual kinetic energy offset from the design energy in its perturbation to particle optics through dispersion and momentum compaction. In this paper, in identifying this centrifugal force on particles as the remnant of the CSR cancellation effect in transverse particle dynamics, we show how the dynamics equation in terms of the canonical momentum for beam motion on a curved orbit is related to the Panofsky-Wenzel theorem for wakefields for beam motion on a straight path. It is shown that the effect of pseudo energy spread can be measurable only for a high-peak-current bunch when the pseudo slice energy spread is appreciable compared to the slice kinetic energy spread. The implication of the pseudo slice energy spread for bunch dynamics in magnetic bends is discussed...|$|R
40|$|This MSc thesis report {{discusses}} a greenfield deep-sea port {{development in}} a developing country along a shallow oceanic coast. A port layout is developed based on a fictional cargo forecast. In the interest of port adaptivity, this layout is kept flexible as possible. The design is subsequently checked with regard to wave penetration and morphology. The wave modelling shows {{that it is possible}} to achieve a sufficiently calm wave climate inside the port, by making use of the interaction between waves and the port’s approach channel. Morphological analysis indicates that a large amount of maintenance dredging will be required to keep the channel at guaranteed depth; this negatively influences the feasibility of the port development. The port layout is based on guidelines and design rules. It features a container terminal, a multi-purpose terminal, three dry bulk terminals and a liquid bulk terminal. The bulk terminals are located downwind of the other terminals. Due to long cargo dwell times, large terminal areas are required. The layout can be expanded step-wise and most terminals can be converted or re-purposed. The breakwater layout is optimised; it extends into the sea beyond the closure depth, preventing immediate bypassing of sediment. The approach channel is designed as a one-way system with a guaranteed depth of - 17 m MSL. This depth necessitates a very long dredged channel; the channel length is more than sixteen kilometres. The channel is designed completely according to PIANC guidelines. The main part of the channel is orientated in the dominant wave direction. Near the port <b>entrance</b> it <b>bends</b> and then enters the port at an angle of 55 ° with the dominant wave direction. The channel shows unexpected interactions with the long swell waves: the waves attune on the channel edge and are subsequently focused on the port entrance, enhancing wave penetration. This interaction is related to wave refraction. The refraction modes depend strongly on the critical wave angle; which is related to changes in water depth. The wave-channel interaction is thoroughly investigated. This investigation leads to measures which can reduce wave penetration. Civil Engineering and GeosciencesHydraulic Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|A set of {{large-scale}} laboratory experiments {{were conducted to}} study channel meander migration. Factors affecting the migration of banklines, including the ratio of curvature to channel width, bend angle, and the Froude number were tested in the experiments. The effect of each factor {{on the evolution of}} channel plan form was evaluated and quantified. The channel bankline displacement was modeled by a hyperbolic function with the inclusion of an initial migration rate and a maximum migration distance. It is found that both the initial migration rate and maximum migration distance exhibit a Gaussian distribution along a channel bend. Correlations between the distributions and the controlling parameters were then studied. Two sets of equations were developed for predicting the initial migration rate and the maximum migration distance. With the initial migration rate and maximum migration distance being developed as a function of geometric and flow parameters, a hyperbolic-function model can be applied to estimate the bankline migration distance. The prediction of channel centerline migration was also developed in this study. The channel centerline was represented with a combination of several circular curves and straight lines. Each curve with the radius of curvature and bend angle was used to describe the channel bend geometry. HEC-RAS was applied to estimate the flow hydraulic properties along the channel by adjusting the channel bed slope. The intersections of two consecutive centerlines were found to be the inflection points of the centerline migration rate. Phase lag to the <b>bend</b> <b>entrance</b> was measured and correlated with the bend length and water depth. The migration rate between two successive inflection points demonstrated a growth and decay cycle.

The results showed that the prediction equation provides agreeable results to the centerline migration of natural rivers...|$|R
40|$|Ceramic {{tape and}} thick film {{technologies}} provide a convenient and flexible {{means for the}} fabrication of three-dimensional microfluidic devices with integrated sensing and actuating elements. Flow conduits, passive and active stirrers, and mesoscopic impactors were developed and fabricated with low temperature co-fired ceramic tapes. The fluid flow through these devices was studied both theoretically and experimentally. ^ Specifically, friction factor correlations were obtained for water flow through straight microchannels with rectangular cross-sections and around bends. The flow topology as the fluid went around bends was studied in detail. The bends induce counter-rotating vortices that stretch and deform material lines; therefore, bends {{can play a role}} in enhancing mixing. Unfortunately, at low Reynolds numbers, the vortices decay quickly and one needs to employ a large number of bends to achieve effective stirring. Since it is not practical to simulate fluid flow through large number of bends using direct numerical simulations, a mapping of the fluid particles from the bend 2 ̆ 7 s <b>entrance</b> to the <b>bend</b> 2 ̆ 7 s exit was computed. By repetitive application of this map together with a rotational map, it was possible to simulate the flow through large numbers of bends with various orientations. A prototype stirrer was fabricated with ceramic tapes, and the stirring effect was demonstrated qualitatively. Since the bend-stirrer is not effective at very low Reynolds numbers, a peristaltic stirrer was also investigated. The peristaltic stirrer consists of a closed cavity in which liquid motion is induced by transmitting traveling waves through the cavity 2 ̆ 7 s walls. The flow field in the cavity was determined analytically and numerically for small and large wall deformations, respectively. Finally, an impactor for the inertial separation of air-borne particles was modeled, analyzed, fabricated, and tested. The results of the computations and experiments were summarized in efficiency curves that depict the fraction of collected particles as a function of their size. ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the heyday}} of steamboats along the Mississippi River, {{it would take a}} boat several hours to travel the 20 miles of Turnbull's Bend, after which it would have progressed only a mile or so from the <b>entrance</b> to the <b>bend.</b> To reduce travel time, Captain Henry M. Shreve, a river {{engineer}} and namesake of Shreveport, Louisiana, dug a canal in 1831 through the neck of Turnbull's Bend; this canal became known as Shreve's Cut. At the next high water, the Mississippi roared through this channel. The upper portion of Turnbull's Bend became the smaller Upper Old River while the lower portion became the larger Lower Old River. At first, the Lower Old River would flow eastward, to the Mississippi, until 1839, when locals began removing a log jam that was obstructing the Atchafalaya River. The project was finished in 1840. After that, the Lower Old River would flow eastward to the Mississippi when the Red River was high and the Mississippi was low, and westward to the Atchafalaya when the Mississippi was high and the Red River was low. Over time, the number of days when the river flowed east to the Mississippi decreased and the number of days when the river flowed west increased, until eventually the Lower Old River flowed west over half the time. By 1880, it rarely flowed eastward and was now rapidly capturing {{more and more of the}} flow of the Mississippi. With this extra intake of water, the channel of the Atchafalaya River was worn deeper and wider throughout the 1800s and early 1900s. Between 1850 and 1950, the flow increased from <10% of the Mississippi to 30%, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began work on the Old River Control Structure (ORCS) to prevent the Atchafalaya becoming the main channel of the Mississippi. In 1963, the The ORCS was completed, and it completely sealed off the Old river. However, a lock, a diversion channel, and flood spillway were installed to allow barges to pass between the Atchafalaya and Mississippi.|$|R
40|$|To {{quantify}} {{primary side}} aerosol retention, an Eulerian/Lagrangian approach {{was used to}} investigate aerosol transport in a compressible, turbulent, adiabatic, internal, wall-bounded flow. The ARTIST experimental project (Phase I) served as the physical model replicated for numerical simulation. Realizable k-? and standard k-? turbulence models were selected from the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, FLUENT, to provide the Eulerian description of the gaseous phase. Flow field simulation results exhibited: a) onset of weak secondary flow accelerated at <b>bend</b> <b>entrance</b> towards the inner wall; b) flow separation zone development on the convex wall that persisted {{from the point of}} onset; c) centrifugal force concentrated high velocity flow {{in the direction of the}} concave wall; d) formation of vortices throughout the flow domain resulted from rotational (Dean-type) flow; e) weakened secondary flow assisted the formation of twin vortices in the outflow cross section; and f) perturbations induced by the bend influenced flow recovery several pipe diameters upstream of the bend. These observations were consistent with those of previous investigators. The Lagrangian discrete random walk model, with and without turbulent dispersion, simulated the dispersed phase behavior, incorrectly. Accurate deposition predictions in wall-bounded flow require modification of the Eddy Impaction Model (EIM). Thus, to circumvent shortcomings of the EIM, the Lagrangian time scale was changed to a wall function and the root-mean-square (RMS) fluctuating velocities were modified to account for the strong anisotropic nature of flow in the immediate vicinity of the wall (boundary layer). Subsequent computed trajectories suggest a precision that ranges from 0. 1 % to 0. 7 %, statistical sampling error. The aerodynamic mass median diameter (AMMD) at the inlet (5. 5 ?m) was consistent with the ARTIST experimental findings. The geometric standard deviation (GSD) varied depending on the scenario evaluated but ranged from 1. 61 to 3. 2. At the outlet, the computed AMMD (1. 9 ?m) had GSD between 1. 12 and 2. 76. Decontamination factors (DF), computed based on deposition from trajectory calculations, were just over 3. 5 for the bend and 4. 4 at the outlet. Computed DFs were consistent with expert elicitation cited in NUREG- 1150 for aerosol retention in steam generators...|$|R
