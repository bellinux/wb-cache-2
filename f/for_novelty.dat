5|$|Orchestras {{continued}} to use noise {{in the form of}} a percussion section, which expanded though the 19th century: Berlioz was perhaps the first composer to thoroughly investigate the effects of different mallets on the tone color of timpani. However, before the 20th century, percussion instruments played a very small role in orchestral music and mostly served for punctuation, to highlight passages, or <b>for</b> <b>novelty.</b> But by the 1940s, some composers were influenced by non-Western music as well as jazz and popular music, and began incorporating marimbas, vibraphones, xylophones, bells, gongs, cymbals, and drums.|$|E

25|$|The {{implications}} of people's preference <b>for</b> <b>novelty</b> for human relationships are not straightforward and obvious. Evidence that people desire novelty comes primarily {{from studies of}} people's reactions to art objects and the like. This is different when it concerns human beings and social relationships because people can shift attention away from already familiar novel objects, while doing so in human relationships is difficult or not possible. But novel art objects {{are very different from}} people. If a piece of art becomes overly stimulating, we can simply shift our attention elsewhere. This is not a viable option should our spouse suddenly begin treating us as if we were someone else, for such treatment would pose serious questions about the integrity of people's belief systems. Consequently, people probably balance competing desires for predictability and novelty by indulging the desire <b>for</b> <b>novelty</b> within contexts in which surprises are not threatening (e.g., leisure activities), while seeking coherence and predictability in contexts in which surprises could be costly—such as in the context of enduring relationships.|$|E
25|$|The drummers and {{the rhythms}} they played served as accompaniment for dance bands, which played ragtime and various dances, with jazz coming later. It was common in these bands {{to have two}} drummers, one playing snare drum, the other bass. Eventually, however, due to various factors (not {{the least of which}} being the {{financial}} motivation), the number of drummers was reduced to one, and this created the need for a percussionist to play multiple instruments, hence the drum set. The first drum sets also began with military drums, though various other accessories were added later {{in order to create a}} larger range of sounds, and also <b>for</b> <b>novelty</b> appeal.|$|E

25|$|However, {{because a}} variety of artists and {{artisans}} have been creating alebrijes in their own styles, the craft {{has become part of}} Mexico's folk art repertoire. No two alebrijes are exactly alike. Outside of the Linares family, one of the most noted alebrije artists is Susana Buyo, who learned to work with cardboard and papier-mâché at one of the Linares family workshops. Known as the “Señora de los Monstruos” by the local children in Condesa, an upscale neighborhood of Mexico City, she is a native Argentinan and naturalized Mexican citizen. Her work can be found across Mexico City and elsewhere, such as those in Europe. Her work differs from that of the Linares in that many of her designs include human contours and many with expressions more tender than terrifying. She also uses nontraditional materials such as feathers, fantasy stones and modern resins, both <b>for</b> <b>novelty</b> and for durability.|$|E
25|$|Marcus {{had much}} {{love and respect}} for his adoptive father. The tribute he gives Pius in the first book of the Meditations is the longest of any. He would have more {{influence}} on the young Marcus than any other person.From my father: gentleness and unshaken resolution in judgments taken after full examination; no vainglory about external honours; love of work and perseverance; readiness to hear those who had anything {{to contribute to the}} public advantage; the desire to reward every man according to his desert without partiality; the experience that knew where to tighten the reign, where to relax. Prohibition of unnatural practices, social tact and permission to his suite not invariably to be present at his banquets nor to attend his progress from Rome, as a matter of obligation, and always to be found the same by those who had failed to attend him through engagements. Exact scrutiny in council and patience; not that he was avoiding investigation, satisfied with first impressions. An inclination to keep his friends, and nowhere fastidious or the victim of manias but his own master in everything, and his outward mien cheerful. His long foresight and ordering of the merest trifle without making scenes. The check in his reign put upon organized applause and every form of lip-service; his unceasing watch over the needs of the empire and his stewardship of its resources; his patience under criticism by individuals of such conduct. No superstitious fear of divine powers nor with man any courting of the public or obsequiousness or cultivation of popular favour, but temperance in all things and firmness; nowhere want of taste or search <b>for</b> <b>novelty.</b>|$|E
500|$|It {{should be}} emphasized, however, that for Whitehead God is not {{necessarily}} tied to religion. [...] Rather than springing primarily from religious faith, Whitehead saw God as necessary for his metaphysical system. [...] His system required that an order exist among possibilities, an order that allowed <b>for</b> <b>novelty</b> {{in the world and}} provided an aim to all entities. [...] Whitehead posited that these ordered potentials exist in what he called the primordial nature of God. [...] However, Whitehead was also interested in religious experience. [...] This led him to reflect more intensively on what he saw as the second nature of God, the consequent nature. [...] Whitehead's conception of God as a [...] "dipolar" [...] entity has called for fresh theological thinking.|$|E

500|$|A {{contemporary}} review {{from the}} Tamil monthly magazine Kalaimanram praised AVM <b>for</b> <b>novelty</b> and called Andha Naal a daring venture. The Tamil weekly Kumudam (dated 1 May 1954) praised Meiyappan for recognising [...] "young talents" [...] like Balachander and Seetharaman. However, the reviewer criticised AVM for not publicising {{the film as}} a thriller; he asserted that had the film been publicised in such manner, the fans {{would not have been}} horrified by the absence of songs in the film. The reviewer's verdict was [...] "Success of art; failure of narrative". The same month, a meeting was organised by the Film Fans Association in Madras to congratulate Meiyappan, Balachander, the actors and the other crew members. V. C. Gopalaratnam, the president of the association, praised Meiyappan for his [...] "pioneering spirit" [...] in producing a film without songs or dances. The Tamil magazine Gundoosi said that, for fans who were wondering whether there would be a day when a shorter film without songs and dance would be produced that had a narrative beyond the traditional love story, [...] "That Day has come. Such a cinema of renaissance is Andha Naal". The writer also appreciated Maruti Rao's cinematography and Meiyappan's courageous effort, and asked fans to support such a film if they [...] "really want Tamil cinema to progress". The Indian Express praised the script by Seetharaman, the performances of Ganesan, Pandari Bai and Sambandam, the absence of songs and dance, and concluded that the film was [...] "remarkable for some fine and original ideas in photography".|$|E
