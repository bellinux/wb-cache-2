500|$|Firstly {{conceived}} and still used today for optical storage devices (CD-RW drives, DVD drives, etc.), several manufacturers offer external portable USB hard disk drives, or empty enclosures for disk drives. These offer performance comparable to internal drives, {{limited by the}} current number and types of attached USB devices, and by the upper limit of the USB interface (in practice about 30MB/s for USB 2.0 and potentially 400MB/s or more for USB 3.0). These external drives typically include a [...] "translating device" [...] that bridges between a drive's interface to a USB interface port. Functionally, the drive appears to the user much like an internal drive. Other competing standards for <b>external</b> <b>drive</b> connectivity include eSATA, ExpressCard, FireWire (IEEE 1394), and most recently Thunderbolt.|$|E

50|$|Fan drives can be {{internal}} or <b>external.</b> Internal <b>drives</b> have the motor inside the autoclave in an unheated chamber. A thick wall of insulation keeps the heat out, and the motor is under full autoclave pressure. <b>External</b> <b>drives</b> require a shaft seal {{to carry the}} drive shaft through the pressure vessel wall. Internal drives are simpler, result in slightly less floor space taken, and impose a small but essential cooling load; <b>external</b> <b>drives</b> require more elaborate drive shaft arrangements and use high pressure seals.|$|R

50|$|TiVo was not {{designed}} to have an <b>external</b> <b>drive</b> disconnected once it has been added, because data for each recording is spread across both {{the internal and external}} disk drives.

5000|$|The Macintosh <b>External</b> Disk <b>Drive</b> is the {{original}} {{of a series of}} external 3.5" [...] floppy disk drives manufactured and sold by Apple Computer exclusively for the Macintosh series of computers introduced in January 1984. Later, Apple would unify their <b>external</b> <b>drives</b> to work cross-platform between the Macintosh and Apple II product lines, dropping the name [...] "Macintosh" [...] from the drives. Though Apple had been producing <b>external</b> floppy disk <b>drives</b> prior to 1984, they were exclusively developed for the Apple II, III and Lisa computers using the industry standard 5.25" [...] flexible disk format. The Macintosh <b>external</b> <b>drives</b> were the first to widely introduce Sony's new 3.5" [...] rigid disk standard commercially and throughout their product line. Apple produced only one <b>external</b> 3.5" [...] <b>drive</b> exclusively for use with the Apple II series called the Apple UniDisk 3.5.|$|R

The Apple 3.5" [...] Drive (A9M0106), is an 800K <b>external</b> <b>drive</b> released in unison with the Apple IIGS computer, and replaced the beige-colored Macintosh 800K <b>External</b> <b>Drive.</b> It works {{on both the}} Apple IIGS {{as well as the}} Macintosh. It came in a case similar to the UniDisk, but in Platinum gray. Like the UniDisk 3.5, the Apple 3.5" [...] Drive includes Apple II-specific features such as a daisy-chain connector which allows two drives to be connected to an Apple II computer, and the presence of a manual disk eject button. The Macintosh however could still only accommodate one <b>external</b> <b>drive,</b> and ignores use of the eject button. But, unlike the Macintosh 800K <b>External</b> <b>Drive,</b> the Apple 3.5" [...] Drive can be used natively with the 64K ROM stock Macintosh 128K & 512K without the HD20 INIT, but only with 400K MFS formatted disks. Designed as a universal <b>external</b> <b>drive</b> replacement, the Apple 3.5" [...] Drive was eventually compatible with the remaining Apple II models in production upon the introduction of the Apple IIc Plus and the Apple II 3.5 Disk Controller Card for the Apple IIe.|$|E

The EX itself supplied power to the <b>external</b> <b>drive,</b> so only Tandy's unit was usable with the EX. The <b>external</b> <b>drive</b> was the standard 360 KB 5.25 inch format; in 1988 a compatible 720 KB 3.5 inch model was offered. A useful feature for the EX and later systems was the ability to boot off either drive, as the drives could be logically swapped when the system booted, so that the drive that was normally drive B: became drive A:, and vice versa, and the drives remained swapped until the system was powered off or reset.|$|E
