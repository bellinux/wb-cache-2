40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} whether {{body mass index}} (BMI) or body fat percentage <b>estimated</b> <b>from</b> BMI, skinfolds, or leg-to-leg bioimpedance are good indicators of nutritional status in adult patients with cystic fibrosis. Body fat percentage measured by whole-body bioimpedance {{was used as the}} reference method. Design: Cross-sectional study using four methods to estimate body fat percentage. All patients filled out a food frequency and a physical activity questionnaire for assessment of their habitual food intake and energy requirements, respectively. Subjects/Setting: Thirty-five adult patients (23 men/ 12 women) with cystic fibrosis, age range 18 to 46 years, were measured during their yearly visit at the outpatient clinic of the Cystic Fibrosis Center in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Statistical Analysis: Mean±standard deviation was calculated for all measurements and 95 % confidence intervals for differences between methods. Bland-Altman plots were used to assess differences between the measures of body composition and Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to determine the relationships between them, and between the energy requirements and the energy intakes. Results: For men the whole-body body fat percentage reference was 14. 1 %± 3. 0, body fat percentage <b>estimated</b> <b>from</b> BMI was 15. 8 %± 4. 3, body fat percentage <b>estimated</b> <b>from</b> skinfolds was 8. 6 %± 4. 8, and body fat percentage <b>estimated</b> <b>from</b> leg-to-leg bioimpedance was 13. 1 %± 4. 9. For women the whole-body body fat percentage reference was 24. 0 %± 5. 9, body fat percentage <b>estimated</b> <b>from</b> BMI was 25. 1 %± 4. 0, body fat percentage <b>estimated</b> <b>from</b> skinfolds was 17. 0 %± 4. 8, and body fat percentage <b>estimated</b> <b>from</b> leg-to-leg bioimpedance was 25. 0 %± 6. 9.

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm was first observed on October11 {{in the central}} Atlantic Ocean, northeast of the Lesser Antilles and southeast of Bermuda.

5|$|A {{vigorous}} tropical wave {{exited the}} west coast of Africa on September 3. It quickly developed an area of deep convection with a well-defined circulation, which prompted it being classified a tropical depression on September4. At the time it was situated hundreds of miles south of Cape Verde at a very low latitude of 7.2°N. Initial intensification was slow as the system moved northwestward, a movement caused by a large mid-level trough over the central Atlantic. On September5 the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Isidore. Subsequently, it intensified at a faster rate, becoming a hurricane on September6. The following day, satellite <b>estimates</b> <b>from</b> the Dvorak technique suggested a peak intensity of 100mph (165km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 978 mbar (hPa; 28.88 inHg).|$|E
5|$|Although the eye feature became {{obscured}} and banding features {{appeared to}} be dissipating six hours after becoming a hurricane, the NHC predicted rapid intensification. As the eye became visible on satellite imagery early on August23, winds increased to 100mph (155km/h), and Fausto became a Category 2 hurricane. Although the convective cloud tops had warmed slightly late that day, wind speeds continued to increase, and intensity estimates made at the University of Wisconsin were as high as 145mph (230km/h), though the National Hurricane Center was in agreement with <b>estimates</b> <b>from</b> all three Dvorak Technique agencies (the Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch (TAFB), the Satellite Analysis Branch (SAB), and the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA)), which estimated winds at 115mph (185km/h).

After moving ashore, the storm turned more to the north and rapidly weakened over land. By 12:00UTC on November9, the JTWC discontinued advisories. The storm weakened into a depression over the northern Bihar state early on November10. On the next day, the system degenerated into a remnant low, by which time the system had turned to the northeast and spread into Nepal.

In Saint Croix, a roadway section leading into Enfield Green collapsed, temporarily cutting the neighborhood off to traffic until a makeshift roadway was created the next day. In La Vallée, on the island's north shore, floods and landslides affected low-lying areas.
