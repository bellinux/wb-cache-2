5|$|The adult caddisfly is a {{medium-sized}} insect with membranous, hairy wings, which {{are held in}} a tent-wise fashion when the insect is at rest. The antennae are fairly long and threadlike, the mouthparts are reduced in size and the legs have five tarsi (lower leg joints). Adults are nocturnal and are attracted to light. Some species are strong fliers and can disperse to new localities, but many fly only weakly. Adults are usually short-lived, most being non-feeders and equipped only to breed. Once mated, the female caddisfly lays eggs in a <b>gelatinous</b> <b>mass,</b> attaching them above or below the water surface depending on species. The eggs hatch in a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|Ascocoryne sarcoides is {{a species}} of fungus in the family Helotiaceae. The species name {{is derived from the}} Greek sarkodes (fleshy). Formerly known as Coryne sarcoides, its taxonomical history has been {{complicated}} by the fact that it may adopt both sexual and asexual forms. Colloquially known as jelly drops or the purple jellydisc, this common fungus appears as a <b>gelatinous</b> <b>mass</b> of pinkish or purple-colored discs. Distributed widely in North America, Europe and Asia, A.sarcoides is a saprobic fungus and grows in clusters on the trunks and branches of a variety of dead woods. Field studies suggest that colonization by A.sarcoides of the heartwood of black spruce confers some resistance to further infection by rot-causing fungi. A.sarcoides contains the antibiotic compound ascocorynin, shown in the laboratory to inhibit the growth of several Gram-positive bacteria.|$|E
25|$|The {{vitreous}} is the transparent, colourless, <b>gelatinous</b> <b>mass</b> {{that fills}} {{the space between}} the lens of the eye and the retina lining the back of the eye. It is produced by certain retinal cells. It is of rather similar composition to the cornea, but contains very few cells (mostly phagocytes which remove unwanted cellular debris in the visual field, as well as the hyalocytes of Balazs of the surface of the vitreous, which reprocess the hyaluronic acid), no blood vessels, and 98–99% of its volume is water (as opposed to 75% in the cornea) with salts, sugars, vitrosin (a type of collagen), a network of collagen type II fibres with the mucopolysaccharide hyaluronic acid, and also a wide array of proteins in micro amounts. Amazingly, with so little solid matter, it tautly holds the eye.|$|E

6000|$|... "On the 11th of February, lat. 60° 52' S., long. 80° 20' E., and March 3, lat. 53° 55' S., long. 108° 35' E., the {{sounding}} instrument came up {{filled with a}} very fine cream-coloured paste, which scarcely effervesced with acid, and dried into a very light, impalpable, white powder. This, when examined under the microscope, was found to consist almost entirely of the frustules of Diatoms, some of them wonderfully perfect in {{all the details of}} their ornament, and many of them broken up. The species of Diatoms entering into this deposit have not yet been worked up, but they appear to be referable chiefly to the genera Fragillaria, Coscinodiscus, Choetoceros, Asteromphalus, and Dictyocha, with fragments of the separated rods of a singular silicious organism, with which we were unacquainted, and which made up {{a large proportion of the}} finer matter of this deposit. Mixed with the Diatoms there were a few small Globigerinoe, some of the tests and spicules of Radiolarians, and some sand particles; but these foreign bodies were in too small proportion to affect the formation as consisting practically of Diatoms alone. On the 4th of February, in lat. 52°, 29' S., long., 71° 36" [...] E., a little to the north of the Heard Islands, the tow-net, dragging a few fathoms below the surface, came up nearly filled with a pale yellow <b>gelatinous</b> <b>mass.</b> This was found to consist entirely of Diatoms of the same species as those found at the bottom. By far the most abundant was the little bundle of silicious rods, fastened together loosely at one end, separating from one another at the other end, and the whole bundle loosely twisted into a spindle. The rods are hollow, and contain the characteristic endochrome of the Diatomaceoe. Like the Globigerina ooze, then, which it succeeds to the southward in a band apparently of no great width, the materials of this silicious deposit are derived entirely from the surface and intermediate depths. It is somewhat singular that Diatoms did not appear to be in such large numbers on the surface over the Diatom ooze as they were a little further north. This may perhaps be accounted for by our not having struck their belt of depth with the tow-net; or it is possible that when we found it on the 11th of February the bottom deposit was really shifted a little to the south by the warm current, the excessively fine flocculent débris of the Diatoms taking a certain time to sink. The belt of Diatom ooze is certainly a little further to the southward in long. 83° E., in the path of the reflux of the Agulhas current, than in long. 108° E.|$|E

50|$|Adults {{normally}} do not feed, but some species {{are known to}} feed on nectar. They can be found flying around at night, because they are nocturnal, and can be caught using light traps.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Gelatinous</b> egg <b>masses</b> {{are common}} {{in a number of}} animal phyla. However, they are {{virtually}} unknown in marine bivalves, with structures that could be thought of as gelat-inous egg masses being reported for only five species. We describe the <b>gelatinous</b> egg <b>mass</b> and intracapsular development in the tropical lucinid Phacoides pectinatus. The embryos devel-oped within individual capsules embedded in a large flimsy, spherical mass. Swimming veligers hatch at 198 mm shell length. They did not feed, settled within several days of hatch-ing, and metamorphosis was completed within 2 weeks of hatching. <b>Gelatinous</b> egg <b>masses</b> might be detected in members of more lucinid species if studies of development included field or in vivo observations of reproduction in addition to producing embryos by stripping the gonads. Additional key words: Bivalvia, Lucinidae, development, Caribbean, Heterodonta <b>Gelatinous</b> egg <b>masses</b> are thought to confer a num-ber of advantages in aquatic environments. They can provide protection either mechanically; via embedded chemical defenses (Ebel et al. 1999), antibacterial compounds (Benkendorff et al. 2001), or sunscreens (Przeslawski et al. 2004); and from desiccation (Peche-nik 1979). In addition, the gel and spacing increases oxygen diffusion between embryos in comparison with clusters of eggs that lack gel (Chaffee & Strathmann 1984; Moran & Woods 2007). The utility of <b>gelatinous</b> egg <b>masses</b> is supported {{by the fact that they}} have evolved multiple times among a diversity of animals including arenicolid, ne-reid, sabellid, and maldanid polychaetes (Strathmann & Strathmann 1989), several families of fishes (Breder & Rosen 1966), and various insects with aquatic development. <b>Gelatinous</b> egg <b>masses</b> are particularly common in molluscs, and are almost ubiquitous among cephalopods and opisthobranch gastropods, in addition to occurring in trochids and members of the caenogastropod littorinid genera Lacuna TURTON...|$|R
50|$|Phyllodesmium horridum {{feeds on}} sea fans (gorgonians) {{of the genus}} Melitodes (family Melithaeidae). It has also been {{reported}} to feed on gorgonians of the genus, Acabaria (also family Melithaeidae). The egg ribbon is a <b>gelatinous</b> <b>mass</b> with many small white eggs.|$|E
50|$|The {{infection}} in leaves usually remains latent until the leaves drop, but leaf spots {{may be found}} on older leaves. The leaf lesions usually produce ascospores, but sometimes produce pycnidia. These pycnidia release pycnidiospores (conidia) in a <b>gelatinous</b> <b>mass.</b> Under wet conditions, the <b>gelatinous</b> <b>mass</b> dissolves and the spores are dispersed by splashes of water. This splash-dispersal method limits reinfection to nearby fruit or leaves of the same tree.Fruit infections remain latent until fruit maturity. Upon maturing, the mycelium grows into the outer rind, {{also known as a}} flavedo. Here in the flavedo, circular lesions form, which are sometimes accompanied by pycnidia. It {{is important to note that}} while ascospores can infect fruit, they have not yet been observed developing on fruit.|$|E
50|$|Males {{call from}} {{vegetation}} above streams. Clutch size {{is up to}} 35 eggs; eggs are green and encased in a <b>gelatinous</b> <b>mass.</b> Eggs are laid on the lower surface of leaves. After hatching the tadpoles fall into the stream below. Males appear sometimes to guard the eggs.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the eastern}} seaboard of the United States, at the first warm rain of spring, the spore horns become <b>gelatinous</b> <b>masses</b> and produce their teliospores. [...] Wind carries the spores to apple leaves at {{about the time that}} apple buds are in the pink or early blossom stage. Upon {{reaching}} apple buds or leaves, the spores attach themselves to the young leaves, germinate, and enter the leaf or fruit tissues. Infection takes place in as little as four hours under favorable conditions. Yellow lesions develop in one to three weeks.|$|R
50|$|The {{animals are}} {{simultaneous}} hermaphrodites, and fertilization occurs internally. A <b>gelatinous</b> egg <b>mass</b> is released during spawning, and the eggs float freely until hatching. Their embryonic shells are lost {{within the first}} few days after hatching.|$|R
50|$|The Trochidae are dioecious, and the {{fertilization}} occurs externally by {{the release}} of eggs and sperm.

50|$|Colloid nodules are {{distinguished}} by an apparently <b>gelatinous</b> <b>mass</b> of colloid both surrounding and contained within follicular cells.

50|$|The river chub {{presence}} in a stream is a good indicator of water quality. They are intolerant of pollution, turbidity and siltation, and require a minimum pH 6.0. They provide ecological services to mussels (as glochidia host), and nest associates, {{some of which may}} not spawn in its absence. Fresh-water mussels release small masses of microscopic larvae known as glochidia in a loose gelatinous matrix. The glochidia encyst on the gills of river chubs where they metamorphose into juveniles and then drop off. It is suspected that the river chub feeds on the <b>gelatinous</b> <b>masses</b> as it does drifting insects. The river chub is host to mussels including the endangered fine-rayed pigtoe, Tennessee clubshell and probably many other amblemine glochidia.|$|R
50|$|P. maculata is a {{predator}} and scavenger, feeding on invertebrate prey and {{the bodies of}} small dead animals.

500|$|The American {{botanist}} Edward Angus Burt {{published a}} detailed description of the development of C.columnatus in 1896. He found that the egg consists of cortical and [...] systems continued upward from the mycelial strand in the earliest stage. The cortical layer gives rise to the outer layer of the volva, the cortical plates and the pseudoparenchyma (thin-walled, usually angular, randomly arranged cells that are tightly packed) of the receptaculum. The medullary portion gives rise to the <b>gelatinous</b> <b>masses</b> of the <b>gelatinous</b> layer of the volva, to the gleba, and to the gelatinous tissue of the chambers of the receptaculum. The elongation of the receptacle begins at the base and after its elongation, the gleba hangs suspended from the arch of the receptaculum by medullary tissue constituting the chamber masses of the receptacle.|$|R
50|$|The {{vitreous}} humour is a transparent, colorless, <b>gelatinous</b> <b>mass</b> that fills {{the space in}} the eye between the lens and the retina. It is present at birth.

5000|$|The crista ampullaris {{itself is}} a {{cone-shaped}} structure, covered in receptor cells called [...] "hair cells". Covering the crista ampullaris is a <b>gelatinous</b> <b>mass</b> called the cupula.

40|$|The free lipid {{content of}} {{extracts}} from the spawn of 17 molluscs were analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. These extracts encompass the encapsulated embryos and extraembryonic structures from benthic <b>gelatinous</b> egg <b>masses</b> and leathery egg capsules covering five taxonomic groups. Palmitic and stearic acids were the dominant {{saturated fatty acids}} and oleic acid was the principal unsaturated acid found in the spawn. Cholesterol was the dominant sterol and the only sterol found in the spawn from every species. Extracts from <b>gelatinous</b> egg <b>masses</b> were found to contain proportionally more fatty acids compared to leathery egg capsules. No unsaturated fatty acids were found {{in any of the}} leathery egg capsules, including five neogastropods and one littorinimorph. Unsaturated fatty acids were present in all of the <b>gelatinous</b> egg <b>masses,</b> including two other littorinimorphs. This is the first study to demonstrate that unsaturated fatty acids possess significant bacteriolytic activity against four aquatic pathogens. Encapsulated Anaspidea egg masses contain relatively high concentrations of these unsaturated fatty acids and a lipid mixture modeled on these extracts was strongly bacteriolytic at concentrations down to 0. 0001 mg/ml. By comparison, lipid mixtures modeled on extracts from the spawn of four other molluscan taxa with higher proportions of saturated fatty acid and cholesterol, were only partially active against some of the bacteria at 0. 1 mg/ml. Thus, unsaturated fatty acids could explain the antimicrobial activity previously reported in lipid extracts of some, but not most, molluscan spawn. MDS ordination and ANOSIM revealed significant taxonomic differences in the composition of free lipids from molluscan spawn, suggesting that lipid analyses may be useful in future systematic studies of the Mollusca...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} and remodeling of the embryonic valves {{is a complex}} and dynamic process that occurs within a constantly changing hemodynamic environment. Defects in embryonic and fetal valve remodeling are {{the leading cause of}} congenital heart defects, yet very little is known about how fibrous leaflet tissue is created from amorphous <b>gelatinous</b> <b>masses</b> called cushions. Microenvironmental cues such as mechanical forces and extracellular matrix composition play major roles in cell differentiation, but almost all research efforts in valvulogenesis center around genetics and molecular approaches. This review summarizes what is known about the dynamic mechanical and extracellular matrix microenvironment of the atrioventricular and semilunar valves during embryonic development and their possible guidance roles. A variety of new computational tools and sophisticated experimental techniques are progressing that enable precise microenvironmental alterations that are critical to complement genetic gain and loss of function approaches. Studies at the interface of mechanical and genetic signaling in embryonic valvulogenesis will likely pay significant dividends, {{not only in terms of}} increasing our mechanistic understanding, but also lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for patients with congenital valve abnormalities...|$|R
