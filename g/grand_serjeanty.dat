50|$|When the {{military}} tenure of knight-service was abolished at the Restoration of the Monarchy by King Charles II (1649-1651), that of <b>grand</b> <b>serjeanty</b> was retained, doubtless {{on account of}} its honorary character, it being then limited in practice {{to the performance of}} certain duties at coronations, the discharge of which as a right has always been coveted, and the earliest record of which is that of the coronation of Queen Eleanor of Provence in 1236. The most conspicuous are those of Queen's Champion, appurtenant to the manor of Scrivelsby, long held by the Dymoke family, and of supporting the king's right arm, appurtenant to the manor of Worksop.|$|E
5000|$|A buttery was {{a service}} {{room in a}} large medieval house in which barrels, bottles, or butts of {{alcoholic}} drink were stored, and from which they were served into the Great Hall. The [...] "butler" [...] was anciently the household officer {{in charge of the}} buttery, and possibly for its provisionment (i.e., the sourcing and purchasing of wine), and was required to serve wine to his lord and guests at banquets. In the royal household such officer was termed the [...] "Marshal of the Buttery" [...] and was often a post discharged under the feudal land tenure of <b>grand</b> <b>serjeanty.</b> In less important households such an officer was termed the yeoman of the buttery.|$|E
50|$|The constableship {{was granted}} as a <b>grand</b> <b>serjeanty</b> with the Earldom of Hereford by the Empress Matilda to Miles of Gloucester, and was carried by his heiress to the Bohuns, Earls of Hereford and Essex. They had a {{surviving}} male heir, {{and still have}} heirs male, but due {{to the power of}} the monarchy the constableship was irregularly given to the Staffords, Dukes of Buckingham; and on the attainder of Edward Stafford, the third Duke, in the reign of King Henry VIII, it became merged into the Crown. Since that point it has not existed as a separate office, except as a temporary appointment for the Coronation of a monarch; in other circumstances the Earl Marshal exercises the traditional duties of the office.|$|E
5000|$|The word [...] "fee" [...] {{is derived}} from fief, meaning a feudal landholding. Feudal land tenures existed in several varieties, most of which {{involved}} the tenant having to supply some service to his overlord, such as knight-service (military service). If the tenant's overlord was the king, <b>Grand</b> <b>Serjeanty,</b> then this might require providing many different services, such as providing horses {{in time of war}} or acting as the king's ceremonial butler. These fiefs gave rise to a complex relationship between landlord and tenant, involving duties on both sides. For example, in return for receiving his tenant's fealty or homage, the overlord had a duty to protect his tenant. When feudal land tenure was abolished all fiefs became [...] "simple", without conditions attached to the tenancy.|$|E
50|$|Another {{possibly}} related 12th- and 13th-century Denys family {{held the}} manor of Sock Dennis near Ilchester, in Somerset, from the Beauchamp family, feudal barons of Hatch Beauchamp. White Hall Hospital in Ilchester {{was founded in}} about 1217-1220 by William Dacus/Le Deneis of Sock Dennis, following his gift of a house and other property. During the reigns of Henry II (1154-1189) and Richard I (1189-1199), the royal forest of Petherton Park, near Bridgwater in Somerset, was held from the crown by Osbert and William Dacus by <b>grand</b> <b>serjeanty</b> of being the king's Forester of Petherton. The Somerset Denys family seems to have died out soon after in the male line. No trace of their armorials has survived from which to make a link to other families of the same name.|$|E

50|$|King Henry {{preferred}} Hugh de Lacy over Strongbow in {{the positions}} of Justiciar and of Constable of Dublin Castle. The grant was {{on the basis of}} <b>grand</b> <b>serjeanty</b> for his services as bailiff to the King. De Lacy chose the barons Robert Fitz-Stephen, Maurice FitzGerald, Meiler Fitzhenry and Miles FitzDavid to garrison the city. This kept them apart from Strongbow. On 17 April 1172, Henry sailed from Ireland never to return. Hugh also returned to England in late 1172 and spend much of the following year fighting for Henry in France. He was sent over to Ireland as procurator-general in 1177, Richard de Clare having died shortly before. The grant of Meath was now confirmed, with the addition of Offelana, Offaly, Kildare, and Wicklow. This left Hugh in possession of most of the over-kingdom of Leinster, in addition to the Kingdom of Meath, with exception of the city of Dublin and the southern principalities of Ossory and Hy-Kinsellagh (Uí Ceinnselaig) (centred on the modern county of Wexford).|$|E
5000|$|In the Peerage of England, Peerage of Ireland, Peerage of Great Britain and the Peerage of the United Kingdom, barons {{form the}} lowest rank, placed {{immediately}} below viscounts. A female of baronial rank has the title baroness. In {{the kingdom of}} England, the medieval Latin word , baronis was used originally to denote a tenant-in-chief of the early Norman kings who held his lands by the feudal tenure of [...] "barony" [...] (in Latin per baroniam), and who was entitled to attend the Great Council (Magnum Concilium) which by the 13th century had developed into the Parliament of England.Feudal baronies (or [...] "baronies by tenure") are now obsolete in England and without any legal force but any such historical titles are held in gross, {{that is to say}} are deemed to be enveloped within a more modern extant peerage title also held by the holder, sometimes along with vestigial manorial rights and tenures by <b>grand</b> <b>serjeanty.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The sovereign's domestics {{were his}} {{officers}} of state, and the leading dignitaries {{of the palace}} were the principal administrators of the kingdom. The royal household itself had, in its turn, grown out of an earlier and more primitive [...] "thegnhood", and among the most eminent and powerful of the king's thegns were his [...] "dishthegn," [...] his [...] "bowerthegn," [...] and his horsethegn or staller. In Normandy {{at the time of}} the Conquest a similar arrangement, imitated from the French court, had long been established, and the Norman dukes, like their overlords the kings of France, had their seneschal or steward, their chamberlain and their constable. After the Norman Conquest, the ducal household of Normandy was reproduced in the royal household of England; and since, in obedience to the spirit of feudalism, the great offices of the first had been made hereditary, the great offices of the second were made hereditary also, and were thenceforth held by the grantees and their descendants as holder of tenure in <b>grand</b> <b>serjeanty</b> of the crown.|$|E
50|$|The land {{forfeited}} to the Conqueror was re-granted by {{him to be}} held by knight-service due to the king, not to the {{mesne lord}} as in European continental feudalism. In 1086 at the council of Salisbury all the landholders swore fealty to the crown. In the full vigour of feudalism the inhabitants of England were either free or not free. The free inhabitants held their lands either by free tenure or by a tenure which was originally that of a non-free inhabitant, but attached to land {{in the possession of}} a free man. Free tenure was either military tenure, called also tenure in chivalry, or socage (including burgage and petit serjeanty), or frankalmoin, by which ecclesiastical corporations generally held their land. The non-free inhabitants were called in the Domesday Book servi, cotarii, or bordarii, and later nativi or villani, the last name being applied to both free men and serfs. All these were in a more or less dependent condition. The free tenures all exist at the present day, though, as will appear later, the military tenures have shrunk into the unimportant and exceptional tenure of <b>grand</b> <b>serjeanty.</b> The non-free tenures are to a certain extent represented by copyhold.|$|E
5000|$|In 1481 Kittisford {{passed to}} the Blewett family on the {{marriage}} of Agnes Sydenham, daughter and heiress of John Sydenham, toNicholas Blewet of Lottisham. The Blewett family had long been seated at nearby Greenham and at nearby Holcombe Rogus in Devon. Walter Blewet, a descendant of Nicholas, as is recorded in his inquisition post mortem, held at his death the manor of Kittisford, and the advowson of the Church of St. Nicholas thereto belonging and a messuage and one hundred acres of land called South Cothay in the parish of Kittisford, held from the overlord [...] "Eleanor, Countess of Northumberland" [...] (apparently Eleanor Poynings, widow of Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland (1421-1461)), by <b>grand</b> <b>serjeanty</b> of one pair of spurs to be paid yearly. His son and heir was Nicholas Blewett (born 1451). In St. Nicholas' Church, Kittisford, survives a monumental brass to Richard Bluett (d.1524) and his wife Agnes Verney. Richard Bluett (d.1524) was the younger son of Walter Bluett of Holcombe Rogus by his wife Jane St Maur, daughter of John St Maur by his wife Elizabeth Brooke, daughter of Thomas Brooke (c.1391-1439), MP for Dorset and Somerset.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} the ceremony at the coronation of an English king dates from the accession of King Richard II (1377-1399). On that occasion, the Champion was Sir John Dymoke (died 1381), who held the manor of Scrivelsby in Lincolnshire, in right of his wife Margaret, granddaughter of Joan Ludlow, who was a daughter and co-heiress of Philip Marmion, 5th Baron Marmion of Tamworth (died 1291), the last baron. The Marmion family claimed descent from the lords of Fontenay, hereditary Champions of the Dukes of Normandy, and were feudal barons of Tamworth in Nottinghamshire, seated at Tamworth Castle and also held the manor of Scrivelsby in Lincolnshire. The right to the Championship was disputed with the Dymoke family by Sir Baldwin de Freville, whose family succeeded that of Marmion as feudal barons of Tamworth, who was descended from Joan Marmion, a daughter and co-heiress of Philip Marmion (d.1291), by her husband Alexander de Freville (d.1328). The Court of Claims eventually decided in favour of the tenant of Scrivelsby because Scrivelsby was held from the king by the feudal tenure of <b>grand</b> <b>serjeanty,</b> that is to say, its tenure demanded the rendering of a special service, namely acting as King's Champion.|$|E
5000|$|In Ireland, most originally-feudal titular baronies {{have long}} {{disappeared}} through obsolescence or disuse. The Lordship of Fingal was granted to Walter de Lacy, Lord of Meath for seven knight's fees, [...] "although the lords thereof hold elsewhere in capite", {{according to the}} unusual grant in 1208 by King John as Lord of Ireland, who allowed de Lacy to retain custody of his fees. [...] Fingal at the time spread from the River Liffey to the River Delvin, north of Dublin, similar to the administrative boundary of today's County Fingal (minus Dublin City) created from part of County Dublin in 1994. A small number of other titular baronies also continued to exist either as submerged titles {{of members of the}} Peerages of Ireland, Great Britain or the United Kingdom, or as titles held by <b>grand</b> <b>serjeanty,</b> such as, originally, Fingal. Those few that thus survive at all are traditionally considered [...] "incorporeal hereditaments", and may continue to exist as interests or estates in land, registrable as such upon conveyance or inheritance under the Registry of Deeds of the Government of Ireland, although increasingly these are seen today as titles held in gross as personal rights, and not as real interests in land.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the reign}} of King Henry I (1100-1135) the manor of Bicton, near Exeter, was granted by the king to John Janitor, who held the manor by the feudal tenure of <b>grand</b> <b>serjeanty</b> {{requiring}} him to provide a county jail, which was an honourable position of trust. The Latin noun Janitor means [...] "door-keeper", generally understood in the sense janitor carceris, [...] "door-keeper of a jail". Thus the tenant took his surname from his form of tenure. The county prison was later transferred to a building beneath Exeter Castle in the county capital Exeter, but the feudal tenant of Bicton was nevertheless for many centuries required to meet part of the repair and maintenance costs of the newly sited jail. The Devon topographer John Swete (d.1821) stated that Dennis Rolle Esq.

50|$|The central {{region of}} Devon was {{occupied}} by the Saxons soon after 682 AD. It was divided into vast estates, and one of these divisions included all land {{within the boundaries of}} the rivers Teign and Bovey, with Moreton as its major settlement. The present parish of over 6,000 acres (24 km2) is the residue of that ancient royal estate. It remained a royal estate immediately after the Norman Conquest of 1066, as is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it is listed as the 45th of the 72 Devonshire holdings of King William the Conqueror. The manor was held by <b>grand</b> <b>serjeanty</b> from the king by Richard de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster (1259-1326) during the reign of King Edward I (1272-1307), for the annual yielding of one sparrow hawk. After that time it was the seat of Sir Philip de Courtenay (d.1314), second son of Sir Hugh de Courtenay (died 1292) feudal baron of Okehampton, by his wife Eleanor le Despenser (died 1328), sister of Hugh le Despenser, 1st Earl of Winchester, and younger brother of Hugh de Courtenay, 1st/9th Earl of Devon (1276-1340) of Tiverton Castle. He died without progeny when Moreton Hampstead was inherited by his elder brother the 1st Earl of Devon, who gave Moreton Hampstead to his third son Robert de Courtenay, who made it his seat. Robert's grandson William de Courtenay (1377-1388) died without progeny, and eventually the manor became the property of Sir Philip Courtenay (1340-1406) of Powderham, 5th or 6th son of Hugh Courtenay, 2nd Earl of Devon (1303-1377). Thenceforth it descended with Powderham and in the time of Pole (d.1635) was a possession of Francis Courtenay (1576-1638), de jure 4th Earl of Devon.|$|E
5000|$|The {{serjeanty}} changed {{during the}} minority of King Henry III to the counting the King's chessman and storing them away after a game. John Russell of Kingston Russell was a household knight of King Richard I from {{at the latest}} 1195 then also of his brother King John and then of his infant son King Henry III, of whose household he became steward. In the capacity of Household Knight he acted {{as part of the}} backbone of the king's army, as a temporary castellan, sheriff, diplomat and general trouble-shooter. He thus served as Constable of Sherborne Castle, and Governor of Corfe Castle, both in Dorset. He undertook an important diplomatic assignment in 1220 to recover Princess Joan, infant sister of Henry III, from the court of Hugh X of Lusignan to whom she had been betrothed and by whom then rejected. Russell died in 1224. He married Rose Bardolph, da. of Thomas Bardolph and widow of Henry de Pomeroy, feudal baron of the large barony of Berry Pomeroy in Devon, consisting of 32 knight's fees. The marriage to this widow of a tenant-in-chief was likely to have been a reward from the king for Russell's services, and brought Russell a life-interest in her large dower lands. John Russell was granted as a further royal mark of gratitude the marriage of one of the heiresses of James de Newmarch, feudal baron of North Cadbury, who had died in 1216 without male heir, leaving 2 infant heiresses, whose marriages became the property of the king by feudal custom. The wardship of the eldest daughter Isabelle was granted by King John to John Russell, who married her to his eldest surviving (3rd.) son Ralph, the marriage of the other daughter Hawise having been acquired by John de Bottrell/Bottreux. The Newmarch lands were thus split in half, one moiety consisting of nearly 17 knight's fees, in Gloucestershire (including Dyrham), Somerset, Buckinghamshire, Wiltshire and Berkshire going to the Russells, with the second half, including the caput of North Cadbury, being confirmed to Bottrell by Henry III in 1218, per the Close Rolls.
