5|$|The Red <b>Ensign</b> of Singapore {{is a civil}} <b>ensign</b> used by privately owned, non-military {{ships that}} are {{registered}} in Singapore. The overall design of the <b>ensign</b> is a modification of the national flag, with {{the ratio of the}} width to the length extended to 1:2. The <b>ensign</b> was created by law in 1966. The use of this <b>ensign</b> is regulated by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA). According to the MPA, the Red <b>Ensign</b> is the only <b>ensign</b> to be used on Singaporean civilian ships, and the national flag is not an acceptable substitute. The <b>ensign</b> must be hoisted on all Singaporean ships on entering or leaving port.|$|E
5|$|Vessels at sea {{do not use}} the {{national}} flag as an <b>ensign.</b> Merchant vessels and pleasure craft fly a civil <b>ensign</b> of red charged in white with {{a variant of the}} crescent and stars emblem in the centre. Non-military government vessels such as coast guard ships fly a state <b>ensign</b> of blue with {{the national}} flag in the canton, charged with an eight-pointed red and white compass rose in the lower fly. Naval warships fly a naval <b>ensign</b> similar to the state <b>ensign,</b> but in white with a red compass rose emblem.|$|E
5|$|A naval <b>ensign</b> {{has been}} used by Lithuania {{starting}} in 1992. The <b>ensign</b> has a white background charged with a blue cross, with the national flag in the canton. The width of each cross is 1/7th of the total width of the <b>ensign,</b> with the ratio being 1:2. Historically, this flag was used as the <b>ensign</b> of the Kaunas Yacht Club, but with a different ratio of 2:3. The naval jack consists of a white field, charged with a blue anchor covered by the naval badge of Lithuania. The badge consists of the Columns of Gediminas in yellow on a red disc. A masthead pennant have been adopted by the Lithuanian Navy to use on their ships.|$|E

Other defaced <b>ensigns</b> were used by vessels of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, the Humber Conservancy, Custom House, the Board of Trade, Lloyd's of London, the Post Office, submarine cable laying ships, and other departments including War Office Ordnance. The flag of Australia and those of its states as well as the flag of New Zealand are defaced blue <b>ensigns.</b> Several yacht clubs are also entitled to fly blue <b>ensigns</b> defaced by their club badge.|$|R

5|$|In 1966, a {{year after}} Singapore's {{independence}} from Malaysia, a document entitled Singapore Merchant Marine <b>Ensign</b> and numbered Misc. 5 of 1966, was laid before Parliament on 6 September 1966 by the Deputy Prime Minister. The document created a civil <b>ensign</b> {{that was to be}} used on ships registered in Singapore. The Red <b>Ensign</b> has been in use since then.|$|E

5|$|The Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF), {{established}} independently in 1952, {{has only}} the plain sun disc as its emblem. This {{is the only}} branch of service with an emblem that does not invoke the rayed Imperial Standard. However, the branch does have an <b>ensign</b> to fly on bases and during parades. The <b>ensign</b> was created in 1972, which was the third used by the JASDF since its creation. The <b>ensign</b> contains the emblem of the branch centered on a blue background.|$|E
5|$|According to the Parliamentary paper Misc. 5 of 1966, the {{background}} of the <b>ensign</b> is red with the ratio of its width to its length being one by two. In contrast, the ratio of the national flag of Singapore is two by three. In the centre of the <b>ensign</b> is a white ring, which surrounds a crescent and five stars also coloured white. The five stars are arranged such that they form a pentagon in the middle. The crescent and stars are taken from the national flag, although in the <b>ensign</b> the crescent appears underneath rather than {{to the left of the}} stars. According to a 1999 circular National Colours for Singapore Ships issued by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), the red colour of the civil <b>ensign</b> is the same as that of the national flag. The shade of red has been defined by the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts as Pantone 032.|$|E

25|$|Masters, primero pilotos, were {{originally}} ranked as <b>ensigns,</b> {{while the second}} masters, segundo pilotos, were ranked below officers but above petty officers. Later the masters were given rank as lieutenant commanders or lieutenants, while the second masters were ranked as sub-lieutenants or <b>ensigns</b> according to seniority. Master's assistant lacked formal rank. From 1821 masters ranked as lieutenants, second masters as sub-lieutenants, and third masters as <b>ensigns.</b> Promotion from the navigation corps to the sea officer corps was not unusual.|$|R

25|$|As was {{the case}} {{throughout}} the British Empire, the Red and Blue <b>Ensigns</b> were the official flags for merchant and government vessels at sea, and the British Admiralty authorised them to be defaced in the fly with the shield from the South African coat of arms. These <b>ensigns</b> were {{not intended to be}} used as the Union's national flag, although they were used by some people as such. Although these <b>ensigns</b> were primarily intended for maritime use, they were also flown on land.|$|R

5|$|Following {{the planned}} {{transfer}} of sovereignty over Hong Kong, plans were drawn up in the 1990s for a new flag to replace the blue <b>ensign.</b> Following a public competition, a red flag with a bauhinia {{was chosen as the}} new flag of Hong Kong. This new flag gained formal legal status replacing the blue <b>ensign</b> at the handover on 1 July 1997.|$|E
5|$|In the Springtime of the Peoples {{during the}} Revolutions of 1848, revolutionaries {{took to the}} streets, many flying the tricolour.

Also, a naval war <b>ensign</b> used these colours.|$|E

5|$|A {{well-known}} {{variant of}} the sun disc design is the sun disc with 16 red rays in a Siemens star formation, which was also historically used by Japan's military, particularly the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy. The <b>ensign,</b> known in Japanese as the , was first adopted as the War flag on May 15, 1870, and was used {{until the end of}} World WarII in 1945. It was re-adopted on June 30, 1954, and is now used as the war flag and naval <b>ensign</b> of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) and the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF). In Korea and China, this flag still carries a negative connotation. The JMSDF also employs the use of a masthead pennant. First adopted in 1914 and readopted in 1965, the masthead pennant contains a simplified version of the naval <b>ensign</b> at the hoist end, {{with the rest of the}} pennant colored white. The ratio of the pennant is between 1:40 and 1:90.|$|E
