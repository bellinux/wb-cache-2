5|$|The Liberian Air Force was {{formally}} dissolved in 2005 {{as part of}} the armed forces demobilization programme, though it had effectively ceased to exist during the civil war. For many years only the United Nations Mission <b>in</b> <b>Liberia</b> (UNMIL) operated military aircraft <b>in</b> <b>Liberia</b> - Mi-8 transport and Mi-24 attack helicopters from Roberts International Airport with several subsidiary locations. With the reduction in strength of UNMIL ahead of its anticipated closure of operations in March 2018, these services were wound down.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, {{seasoned}} diplomat James K. Bishop {{was appointed}} US Ambassador to Somalia. In 1967, Bishop {{was at the}} US Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon when the Six-Day War erupted, which prompted the evacuation of about 3,600 Americans in 33 hours; Bishop was one of 26 diplomats and Marines that remained in the city during the conflict. Ambassador Bishop also gained valuable experience organizing evacuations of several embassies in the 1980s while serving as Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Africa. In his previous post, as US ambassador to Liberia, Bishop was overseeing the voluntary evacuation of embassy staff and civilians as a civil war <b>in</b> <b>Liberia</b> spread, when he left in March 1990. Ambassador Bishop returned to Washington to prepare for his new appointment to Somalia, but he was soon appointed to a taskforce {{to deal with the}} crisis <b>in</b> <b>Liberia,</b> which included a gradual evacuation of American civilians and a rapid closure of the embassy in August.|$|E
5|$|Ben Ammi Ben-Israel {{established}} the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem in Chicago, Illinois, in 1966, {{at a time}} when black nationalism was on the rise {{as a response to the}} Civil Rights Movement. In 1969, after a sojourn <b>in</b> <b>Liberia,</b> Ben Ammi and about 30 Hebrew Israelites moved to Israel. Over the next 20 years, nearly 600 more members left the United States for Israel. As of 2006, about 2,500 Hebrew Israelites live in Dimona and two other towns in the Negev region of Israel, where they are widely referred to as Black Hebrews. In addition, there are Hebrew Israelite communities in several major American cities, including Chicago, St. Louis, and Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|From 1945 to 1964, the {{officers}} appointed were nearly all college graduates. From 1951, {{there was a}} US military mission based <b>in</b> <b>Liberia</b> to assist in training the AFL. A Reserve Officers' Training Corps was established in 1956 with units at the University of Liberia in Monrovia and the Booker Washington Institute in Kakata. By 1978 the program had been redesignated the Army Student Training Program (ASTP) and had a total of 46 students at the University of Liberia, the Booker Washington Institute, and three smaller institutions. However {{it was not until}} the late 1960s that the Tubman Military Academy was established in Todee District, upper Montserrado County, as an officer training facility.|$|E
50|$|In August 1853, Harris {{was elected}} to one of Montserrado County's seats <b>in</b> <b>Liberia's</b> House of Representatives. A few months into his term on April 25, 1854, however, he was killed when {{he was struck by}} {{lightning}} during a violent thunderstorm.|$|R

5|$|The Liberian open registry, {{founded in}} 1948, was {{the brainchild of}} Edward Stettinius, who had been Franklin D. Roosevelt's Secretary of State during World War II. Stettinius created a {{corporate}} structure that included The Liberia Corporation, a joint-venture with the government of Liberia. The corporation was structured so that one-fourth of its revenue would go to the Liberian government, another 10% went to fund social programs <b>in</b> <b>Liberia,</b> and the remainder returned to Stettinius' corporation. The Liberian registry was created at a time when Panama's registry was becoming less attractive for several reasons including its unpopularity with the U.S. labor movement and European shipping concerns, political unrest in Panama, and increases in its fees and regulations.|$|E
5|$|With {{a view to}} {{enhancing}} educational developments <b>in</b> <b>Liberia,</b> in late 1963 {{and early}} 1964, Massaquoi spent six months in the United States on an education scholarship, visiting fine arts colleges and university departments of anthropology and sociology, mainly {{in the east and}} mid-west. In 1968, while living in Monrovia, Liberia, with her daughter Vivian Seton and her grandchildren, Massaquoi suffered a stroke. This pressed Seton into having the 700 pages of her mother's unpublished autobiography microfilmed, calling on the assistance of colleagues at the University of Liberia. Massaquoi retired from the university in the summer of 1972, receiving an honorary Doctor of Humanities degree. She was also decorated as a Grand Commander of the Grand Star of Africa by the president of Liberia.|$|E
5|$|Muller {{was destined}} to step into his father's {{footsteps}} and become a businessman. He first attended the private institution Delfos followed by the Hogere Burgerschool (high school) in Rotterdam, before continuing his education in Germany, at the Hohe Real Schule in Frankfurt-am-Main, to specialise in trade and business. After finishing his studies with good results, he continued his training with internships in business firms in Liverpool, Manchester, and Marseilles. His first serious job came when his father called him back to Rotterdam in 1882, to become interim manager of the Handels Compagnie Mozambique (Trading Company Mozambique), an ill-performing trading firm doing business in Mozambique. In 1882/'83 Muller travelled to East Africa and visited all the trading posts and establishments of the firm, changing business practices. At {{the end of his}} trip he made an extensive tour of South Africa, visiting Natal, Zululand, Transvaal, the Orange Free State, and the Cape Colony. On his return to Rotterdam he advised the directors of the company on business opportunities. Subsequently he was appointed co-director of the reconstituted company, now called the Oost-Afrikaansche Compagnie (East African Company), as well as deputy manager in his father's firm, Hendrik Muller & Co., which had important trading interests <b>in</b> <b>Liberia</b> and elsewhere in West Africa.|$|E

5|$|While the UN was {{reluctant}} to engage with the F-FDTL, several bilateral donors have assisted the force's development. Australia has provided extensive training and logistical support to the F-FDTL since it was established, and currently provides advisors who are posted to the F-FDTL and Ministry of Defence and Security. Portugal also provides advisors and trains two naval officers each year in Portugal. China provided US$1.8million in aid to the F-FDTL between 2002 and 2008 and agreed {{to build a new}} US$7million headquarters for the force in late 2007. East Timor is one of Brazil's main destinations for aid and the Brazilian Army is responsible for training the F-FDTL's military police unit (Maubere Mission). The United States also provides a small amount of assistance to the F-FDTL through the State Department's International Military Education and Training Program. While Malaysia has provided training courses and financial and technical aid, this assistance was suspended after the 2006 crisis. Under current arrangements Portugal provides the F-FDTL with basic and advanced training while Australia and other nations provide training in specialised skills. As of 2013 the East Timorese government had posted a single member of the F-FDTL to serve overseas as an observer with the United Nations Mission <b>in</b> <b>Liberia.</b> In 2015 the government was considering joining Australia's Pacific Patrol Boat Program.|$|E
