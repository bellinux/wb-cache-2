500|$|The pessimism {{expressed}} by Phillips and Mecklin surprised Frederick Nolting, who preceded Lodge as the US ambassador in Saigon. Nolting said that Phillips' account [...] "surprised the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> I couldn't believe my ears." [...] Nolting asserted that Mecklin was psychologically vulnerable to being brainwashed {{because he had}} recently split with his wife. At the time, Mecklin was living with journalists David Halberstam and Neil Sheehan of The New York Times and UPI respectively. Halberstam and Sheehan both won Pulitzer Prizes and were strident critics of Diệm.|$|E
500|$|At Sutter's July 2006 {{induction}} to the Hall, Smith {{talked with}} reporters about his chances for election. Like many others, he commented {{that he was}} puzzled {{that he had not}} yet been selected. [...] "This confuses the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> But I've always been baffled by it", he said. Smith's candidacy may have been hampered by the number of outstanding relievers on the ballot; Sutter had earned increasing vote totals for nine years before Smith appeared on the ballot, and Gossage—who first appeared on the ballot three years before Smith—has received greater support in each year from 2004 until his induction in 2008.|$|E
500|$|Of the end result, Spotnitz said [...] "I {{was very}} pleased with the way it was executed, and I {{think it was a good}} mystery. He later wrote that he [...] "liked [...] more as time has gone on." [...] Director Rob Bowman {{admitted}} to being tired and not inspired by the time this episode—the second to last of the season—was produced. This lack of interest later resulted in the episode taking extra time to finish. Bowman later recalled that the most difficult aspect of the episode was filming the climactic human sacrifice scene, if only because of the ceremonial mask featured. He explained, [...] "the mask scared the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> only because I thought, 'Boy, if I don't shoot this right, it's going to be silly." ...|$|E

500|$|Still in {{a shallow}} dive, I {{observed}} another P-38 and an Me 109 going round and round. It seemed that the 38 needed help so I started down. At about , [...] the Jerry, still way out of my range, turned under me and slightly to the right. I rolled over on my back, following him and gave him an ineffective burst at long range. By this time I was traveling in excess of [...] My left window blew out, scaring the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> I thought I {{had been hit by}} some of the ground fire I had observed in the vicinity. I regained control of the aircraft and pulled out above a wheat field. I tried to contact the flight to get myself recognized, but observed an Me 109 making a pass at me from about seven o'clock high. I broke left as well as my plane could and the Jerry overshot. I straightened out and gave him a burst. He chandelled steeply to the left and I shot some more. He passed right over me and I slipped over in an Immelmann. As I straightened out at the top, I saw the pilot bail out.|$|E
500|$|Barkley is {{an outspoken}} {{supporter}} of gay rights. In 2006, he told Fox Sports: [...] "I'm a big advocate of gay marriage. If {{they want to}} get married, God bless them." [...] Speaking to Wolf Blitzer on CNN two years later, he said: [...] "Every time I hear the word 'conservative,' it makes me sick to my stomach, because they're really just fake Christians, as I call them. That's all they are. ... I think they want to be judge and jury. Like, I'm for gay marriage. It's none of my business if gay people want to get married. I'm pro-choice. And I think these Christians, first of all, they're not supposed to judge other people. But they're the most hypocritical judge of people we have in the country. And it bugs the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> They act like they're Christians. They're not forgiving at all." [...] During a 2011 Martin Luther King, Jr. Day double-header on TNT, Barkley responded to a statement made by Dr. King's daughter Bernice, by saying, [...] "People try to make it about black and white. [...] he talked about equality for every man, every woman. We have a thing going on now, people discriminating against homosexuality in this country. I love the homosexuality people. God bless the gay people. They are great people." ...|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{headed for}} a group of Japanese aircraft, and due to a {{combination}} of clouds and smoke, he unintentionally entered the middle of the formation of seven or eight A6M Zeros. A Japanese rear-gunner from a dive bomber fired at Taylor's aircraft and one of the bullets came within an inch of Taylor's head and exploded in the cockpit. One piece went through his left arm and shrapnel entered his leg. Taylor reflected on the injuries in a 2001 interview, saying [...] "It was of no consequence; it just scared the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> for a minute." [...] A few years after the interview, Taylor received from his crew chief two other slugs that had been found behind his seat. Welch shot down the dive bomber aircraft that had injured Taylor, and Taylor damaged another aircraft (his second probable kill) before pulling away to assist Welch with a pursuing A6M Zero fighter. The Zero and the rest of its formation soon broke off the pursuit and left to return to their carriers as Taylor neared Welch. Taylor continued to fire on several Japanese aircraft until he ran out of ammunition. Both pilots headed back to Haleiwa. After landing and driving back to Wheeler, Taylor and Welch passed by their squadron commander, Major Gordon H. Austin, who noticed that they were wearing their tuxedo attire. Unaware of their earlier dogfights, he shouted at the two men, saying [...] "Get back to Haleiwa! You know there's a war on?" [...] The two pilots explained what they had done, and the commander thanked them. In a 2003 interview, Taylor reflected on his actions: [...] "I wasn't in the least bit terrified, {{and let me tell you}} why: I was too young and too stupid to realize that I was in a lot of danger." ...|$|E

Referring to the comparison, Minogue said: [...] "t is hard to be compared {{all the time to}} Kylie. On the other hand, however, people will always try to compare you to somebody. Look at Britney and Christina." [...] In an interview with Elle in April 2009, Kylie criticised X Factor judge Louis Walsh for his jibes at her sister: [...] "I'm so proud of my sister and it annoys the <b>hell</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> when comparisons between us are made. In England you lot don't know where she came from. She was on TV every week from 7 years old. It makes it harder for her when she gets Louis Walsh's rather pathetic jibes – one of which is she hasn't had a hit record and that's just not true." [...] She also denied rumours that she did not get on with Cheryl Cole or former judge Sharon Osbourne as [...] "so cheap".|$|E
