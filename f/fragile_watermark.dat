Yeo and Yeung [34] were first to propose a <b>fragile</b> <b>watermarking</b> method to perform authentication of 3 -D polygonal meshes. Although their method can authenticate the integrity of 3 -D polygonal meshes, it cannot be used for localiza-tion of changes. In addition, it is unable to distinguish malicious attacks from incidental data processings. In this paper, we trade off the causality problem in Yeo and Yeung’s method for a new <b>fragile</b> <b>watermarking</b> scheme. The proposed scheme can not only achieve localization of malicious modifications in visual inspection, but also is immune to certain incidental data processings (such as quantization of vertex coordinates and vertex reordering). During the process of watermark embedding, a local mesh parameteriza-tion approach is employed to perturb the coordinates of invalid vertices while cautiously maintaining the visual appearance of the original model. Since the proposed embedding method is indepen-dent of the order of vertices, the hidden watermark is immune to some attacks, such as vertex reordering.

The modifications can therefore be detected in the blocks that have been tampered with. The literature includes many authentication techniques for detecting modifications only. In this paper, we propose a method for recovering the damaged blocks using the magnitudes of DFT coefficients. If a given block is considered to be damaged, we divide it into 2 x 2 blocks, and replace the magnitude of the DFT coefficient F(0, 0) with the predicted magnitude close to the original image. As the F(0, 0) coefficients are always real, we quantize them and round them off. An index map and a small set of DFT coefficients from the original image are employed for image recovery and are sent from the sender to the receiver using a public key scheme. As an image authentication system, we will use the scheme proposed by Wong and Memon.
