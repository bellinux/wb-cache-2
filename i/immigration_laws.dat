40|$|About the book: This book {{examines}} <b>immigration</b> <b>law</b> from {{a gender}} perspective. It shows how <b>immigration</b> <b>law</b> situates gender conflicts outside the national order, projecting them onto non-western countries, exotic cultures, clandestine labour and criminal organizations. In doing so, <b>immigration</b> <b>law</b> sustains {{the illusion that}} gender conflicts have moved beyond the pale of European experience. In fact, the classical feminist themes of patriarchy, the gendered division of labour and sexual violence are still being played out {{at the heart of}} Europe's societies, involving both citizens and migrants. This collection of essays demonstrates how the seemingly marginal perspective of <b>immigration</b> <b>law</b> highlights Europe's unresolved gender conflicts and how a gender perspective can help us to rethink <b>immigration</b> <b>law...</b>|$|R

He was never prosecuted for crimes related to the Salmonella attack.|$|E
5|$|Children of Men is a 2006 British-American dystopian thriller film {{directed}} and co-written by Alfonso Cuarón. The screenplay, based on P. D. James' 1992 {{novel of the}} same name, was credited to five writers, with Clive Owen making uncredited contributions. The film takes place in 2027, where two decades of human infertility have left society {{on the brink of}} collapse. Illegal immigrants seek sanctuary in the United Kingdom, where the last functioning government imposes oppressive <b>immigration</b> <b>laws</b> on refugees. Owen plays civil servant Theo Faron, who must help a refugee (Clare-Hope Ashitey) escape the chaos. Children of Men also stars Julianne Moore, Michael Caine, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Charlie Hunnam.|$|E

40|$|<b>Immigration</b> <b>law</b> does {{lag behind}} in the {{advancement}} of public law, but not in all respects. While <b>immigration</b> <b>law</b> is idiosyncratic in many ways, this Article finds <b>immigration</b> <b>law</b> in the administrative law mainstream {{when it comes to}} its troubles with nonlegislative rules (sometimes called guidance documents). There are concerns throughout administrative law that agencies use such rules to bind regulated parties practically, even if not legally, without the procedural protections of notice and comment. This Article analyzes immigration troubles with nonlegislative rules and makes three main contributions. First, it casts new light on the negative effects of guidance documents by viewing administrative law through the lens of <b>immigration</b> <b>law.</b> In <b>immigration</b> <b>law,</b> the cons of guidance documents play out in the context of some of life’s most fundamental questions: where and with whom to live and to work. Second, by showing how administrative <b>law</b> manifests in <b>immigration</b> <b>law,</b> this Article concludes that <b>immigration</b> <b>law’s</b> troubles cannot be divorced from the mainstream administrative law debate over nonlegislative rules. Third, this Article also evaluates a procedure new to immigration law: the draft memorandum for comment. Through the draft memorandum for comment procedure, the public may comment on draft guidance documents, but is not afforded the full protections of notice-and-comment rulemaking. While the new procedure is a pragmatic and positive step for <b>immigration</b> <b>law,</b> this Article highlights that nonlegislative rules are not the only administrative tool available and argues for greater priority for notice-and-comment rulemaking in <b>immigration</b> <b>law...</b>|$|R

5|$|John Williamson was {{released}} early, in 1955, and deported to England, {{although he had}} lived in the United States since the age of ten. Irving Potash moved to Poland after his release from prison, then re-entered the United States illegally in 1957, and was arrested and sentenced to two years for violating <b>immigration</b> <b>laws.</b> Robert G. Thompson skipped bail, was captured in 1953, and sentenced to an additional four years. He died in 1965 and U.S. Army officials refused him burial in Arlington National Cemetery. His wife challenged that decision, first losing in U.S. District Court and then winning in the Court of Appeals. Defense attorney George W. Crockett Jr. later became a Democratic congressman from Michigan.|$|E
5|$|Drake Doremus was {{inspired}} to make Like Crazy {{by the end of}} his eight-year long-distance relationship with Desiree Pappenscheller, who lived in London while Doremus lived in Los Angeles. Many elements of the film resemble their real-life relationship, such as frequent travelling between Los Angeles and London, trouble with American <b>immigration</b> <b>laws,</b> a brief marriage, a trip to Santa Catalina Island (where Jacob takes Anna in the early stages of their relationship), and the gift of a bracelet (in the film, a bracelet is given to Anna by Jacob). The story was co-written by Ben York Jones, who had also been involved in long-distance relationships. Together, they assembled a 50-page outline of the film which read more like a short story than a traditional screenplay. The outline included backstory, plot points, specific scene objectives, themes and emotional moments, but had minimal dialogue.|$|E
25|$|A growing {{population}} of Indians, primarily of the Sikh religion, were also required {{to abide by}} <b>immigration</b> <b>laws</b> starting in 1908, {{despite the fact that}} they were subjects of the British Empire. This culminated in the 1914 Komagata Maru incident, in which most of 376 immigrants on the Komagata Maru, most of them from the Punjab in India were not permitted to disembark because they had not complied with <b>immigration</b> <b>laws</b> that required that they come by a continuous passage from their home country.|$|E

40|$|In {{an effort}} to explain the massive growth of {{immigration}} imprisonment, this Essay explores the use of race and class as tools for policing <b>immigration</b> <b>law.</b> The Essay does this by contemplating the effect of an <b>immigration</b> <b>law</b> scheme that, at its most fundamental, requires sorting desirable immigrants from undesirable immigrants, and that, in recent years, has accomplished this sorting through increased reliance on criminal records. Placing these two features of contemporary <b>immigration</b> <b>law</b> {{within the context of}} two decades-old forms of indisputably racialized policing—mass incarceration of black and brown people for criminal law violations and the Supreme Court's sanctioning of racial profiling in <b>immigration</b> <b>law</b> policing—the Essay concludes that it was inevitable for penal imprisonment trends to taint <b>immigration</b> <b>law</b> enforcement with raced and classed mass incarceration...|$|R
40|$|Sub-federal {{enforcement}} of <b>immigration</b> <b>law</b> has expanded {{significantly in the}} last decade raising questions concerning policing, rights violations, and remedies. While the Fourth Amendment has historically provided an avenue for potentially suppressing evidence obtained in violation of a criminal defendant’s civil rights, its applicability in the immigration removal context has been circumscribed. Thus, the avenues {{to protect the rights of}} unauthorized noncitizens in immigration removal proceedings are less clear where sub-federal agents act outside of their authorization, particularly in the context of Secure Communities, and enforce <b>immigration</b> <b>law.</b> In the context of immigration exceptionalism, racial profiling has historically played a unique role in <b>immigration</b> <b>law.</b> The lack of adequate measures to deter rights violations where sub-federal agents enforce <b>immigration</b> <b>law</b> raises questions concerning the relationship between criminal and <b>immigration</b> <b>law,</b> and the importance of deterring civil rights violations such as racial profiling, in immigration enforcement. This article will examine the problem of sub-federal law enforcement agents’ use of criminal law violations as a pretext to enforce <b>immigration</b> <b>law</b> and the lack of adequate deterrence of civil rights violations...|$|R
25|$|Although {{migrants}} from Asia {{have been in}} parts of the contemporary United States since the 17th century, large-scale immigration did not begin until the mid-18th century. Nativist <b>immigration</b> <b>laws</b> during the 1880s–1920s excluded various Asian groups, eventually prohibiting almost all Asian immigration to the continental United States. After <b>immigration</b> <b>laws</b> were reformed during the 1940s-60s, abolishing national origins quotas, Asian immigration increased rapidly. Analyses of the 2010 census have shown that Asian Americans are the fastest growing racial or ethnic minority in the United States.|$|E
