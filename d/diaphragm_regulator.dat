Environmental sealing of the diaphragm main spring chamber using a soft secondary diaphragm and hydrostatic transmitter or a silicone, alcohol or glycol/water mixture antifreeze liquid in the sealed spring compartment can be used for a <b>diaphragm</b> <b>regulator.</b> Silicone grease in the spring chamber can be used on a piston first stage. The Poseidon Xstream first stage insulates the external spring and spring housing from the rest of the regulator, so that it is less chilled by the expanding air, and provides large slots in the housing so that the spring can be warmed by the water, thus avoiding the problem of freezing up the external spring.|$|E
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{inhalation}} {{the bellows}} bottoms out and activates an addition valve, in much {{the way that a}} <b>regulator</b> <b>diaphragm</b> activates the demand valve, to make up the gas discharged by the inner bellows. This type of rebreather therefore tends to operate at a minimal volume.|$|R
50|$|The {{feed gas}} is {{supplied}} by a depth compensated first stage regulator which takes {{gas from the}} cylinder and reduces the pressure to 3 bar above ambient pressure.A linkage connected to the bellows rotates a cam against the control spring in the dosage regulator, to adjust the spring force on the dosage <b>regulator</b> <b>diaphragm.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Front cover {{illustrations}} (one shown here, one {{linked to}} in its caption) for the novel obviously inspired by contemporary diving apparatus show its life-support backpack as a correctly drawn old-type open-circuit two-cylinder aqualung as used for scuba diving with manifold and large round regulator and A-clamp. The artist avoided the error {{found in most}} comic-strip drawings of old-type aqualungs, of drawing each breathing tube coming directly from a cylinder top and no regulator. But to make this type of aqualung (as shown here) work in space, its regulator's existing perforated [...] "wet-side" [...] cover {{would have to be}} replaced by a sealed cover with a spring-loaded exit valve to keep a breathable pressure on the [...] "wet" [...] side of the <b>regulator</b> <b>diaphragm.</b> And the whole breathing system would have to be checked for leaks which would be harmless in scuba diving but would blow in space vacuum.|$|R
50|$|Two stage {{regulators}} are two single stage regulators in one that operate {{to reduce the}} pressure progressively in two stages instead of one. The first stage, which is preset, reduces {{the pressure of the}} supply gas to an intermediate stage; gas at that pressure passes into the second stage. The gas now emerges at a pressure (working pressure) set by the pressure adjusting control knob attached to the <b>diaphragm.</b> Two stage <b>regulators</b> have two safety valves, so that if there is any excess pressure there will be no explosion. A major objection to the single stage regulator is the need for frequent torque adjustment. If the supply pressure falls, the outlet pressure increases, necessitating torque adjustment. In the two stage regulator, there is automatic compensation for any drop in the supply pressure. Single stage regulators may be used with pipe lines and cylinders. Two stage {{regulators are}} used with cylinders and manifolds.|$|R
