5|$|Arnold, {{convinced}} that Crown Point {{was no longer}} viable {{as a point of}} defense against the large British force, destroyed and abandoned the fort, moving the forces stationed there to Ticonderoga. General Carleton, rather than shipping his prisoners back to Quebec, returned them to Ticonderoga under a <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>truce.</b> On their arrival, the released men were so effusive in their praise of Carleton that they were sent home to prevent the desertion of other troops.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Stillman's run was {{a turning}} point. Prior to this battle, Black Hawk had not been {{committed}} to war. Now he determined to avenge {{what he saw as}} the treacherous killing of his warriors under a <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>truce.</b> After Stillman's defeat, American leaders like President Jackson and Secretary of War Lewis Cass would not consider a diplomatic solution; they wanted a resounding victory over Black Hawk to serve as an example to other Native Americans who might consider similar uprisings.|$|E
5|$|After Christmas 1914, {{sporadic}} {{attempts were}} made at seasonal truces; a German unit attempted to leave their trenches under a <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>truce</b> on Easter Sunday 1915, but were warned off by the British opposite them, {{and later in the}} year, in November, a Saxon unit briefly fraternised with a Liverpool battalion. In December 1915, there were explicit orders by the Allied commanders to forestall any repeat of the previous Christmas truce. Individual units were encouraged to mount raids and harass the enemy line, whilst communicating with the enemy was discouraged by artillery barrages along the front line throughout the day. The prohibition was not completely effective, however, and a small number of brief truces occurred.|$|E
60|$|Wondering, and displeased at a sight so {{unexpected}} and singular--for it was customary to leave all <b>flags</b> <b>of</b> <b>truce</b> and other communications from the enemy at an appointed place without the barriers--the baron looked eagerly round for some {{one of whom}} he might inquire {{the cause of this}} alarming novelty.|$|R

5|$|Now {{under the}} command of Hill, and {{accompanied}} by two German prisoners acting as interpreters, the Australians proceeded down the road under a <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>truce</b> and persuaded the garrisons of two more trenches to surrender, but not before another skirmish in which the Germans counter-attacked, wounding three more Australians, one fatally. During the firefight one of the unarmed German interpreters was killed by the Australians, as were several of the Melanesians. The advance continued and another group of defenders was encountered and disarmed by nightfall. By 19:00the Australians reached the radio station which was found abandoned; the mast had been dismantled, although the instruments and machinery remained intact. The surviving defenders had abandoned the defences and withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|The B-class {{boats were}} deemed {{redundant}} once more capable submarines arrived in early 1915 and most returned to Malta. B6 and B11, however, {{were sent to}} Alexandria where they conducted patrols along the Libyan coast to prevent arms deliveries to rebellious tribesmen. During one incident on 16 August 1915 a party of Arabs and officers in European uniforms were spotted displaying a <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>truce.</b> The two submarines anchored and Lieutenant Holbrook was rowed ashore to talk to them. They opened fire, killing one man and wounding three, including Holbrook. The submarines were soon withdrawn from this task as they were totally unsuitable for this duty, lacking any deck armament at all.|$|E

In order to preserve its remaining strength, the Chinese 191st Division was forced to pull back by , surrendering the control of Hill 217 without a fight. At first light more than 120 Chinese dead and wounded lay around the Australian defences and {{in contrast to the}} savage fighting during the night, Chinese stretcher parties were allowed to come forward and collect their wounded under a <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>truce.</b> The Australians had been victorious but were now exhausted after five days of heavy fighting.|$|E

5|$|As the Batavian force {{prepared}} to sail, on 16 August Elphinstone's fleet appeared off the bay, {{led by the}} scouting frigate Crescent. He {{sent a letter to}} Lucas demanding his surrender but this was refused. Ascertaining the strength of the Batavian force, on 17 August Elphinstone led his fleet into the bay in line of battle and brought the line to anchor at close gunshot range from Lucas's ships. Trapped between the coast and the British, Lucas immediately raised a <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>truce.</b> He then sent an officer to negotiate terms with Elphinstone. By 17:00, hopelessly outnumbered and his crews in open rebellion, Lucas agreed to terms that dictated an almost unconditional surrender of the Batavian force. Elphinstone furthermore refused Lucas's request for cartels to immediately send his crews back to the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|In 1760, British {{relations}} with the Cherokee, which had been moderately friendly for several decades, grew sour after several Cherokee chiefs were imprisoned and killed in South Carolina. In early 1760, the Cherokee laid siege to Fort Loudoun, a remote outpost {{in what is now}} Tennessee. The garrison held out until August of that year, but was forced to surrender due to lack of provisions. A relief column under Archibald Montgomerie failed to reach the fort after burning the Cherokee Lower Towns and being stopped at the Battle of Echoee. In spite of the garrison leaving the fort under a <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>truce,</b> the Cherokee killed 22 of its members on their march home in retaliation for the colonists' earlier killing of 22 Cherokee held as prisoners at Fort Prince George (South Carolina).|$|E

Hidden in the chest is an orb, which glows brighter as Bok activates it, causing Picard to be hit by a wave of pain. Dr. Crusher orders him back to the Enterprise. Data meanwhile finds a discrepancy in the Stargazers logs stating that the Ferengi were attacked under a <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>truce.</b> Upon further investigation, Data and La Forge report to Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) that the logs were certainly faked. Dr. Crusher and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) discuss the Captain, and Wesley shows them some unusual activity from the Ferengi ship. They head to inform Riker to alert him to the signals, who is informed by the Enterprise computer that Picard has transported to the Stargazer.|$|E
50|$|The ship also {{functioned as}} a {{receiving}} ship for receiving other steamers under <b>flags</b> <b>of</b> <b>truce,</b> taking captured United States POWs to Harrison's Landing for exchange. Steamers under <b>flags</b> <b>of</b> <b>truce</b> would stop at the Patrick Henry to get their permit to continue downriver, and then return and discharge liberated former Confederate States prisoners.The Patrick Henry was specially modified {{to serve as the}} school ship in May 1862 when she was sent to the Rocketts Navy Yard in Richmond. All but four of her guns had been mounted at the naval battery at Drewry's Bluff on the James River. The four remaining guns were used for gunnery drills and training of the midshipmen, and served to assist, when necessary, in the defense of that river location. Two class rooms made of pine boards were mounted amidships on the gun deck between the paddlewheel boxes, and an oversized fully rigged mast was placed forward for sail handling and training. Finally a small launch armed with a twelve-pound howitzer was kept on davits for training.|$|R
50|$|Gyles’ {{knowledge}} of and fluency in the Indian dialects of Acadia made him invaluable to the governing authorities of New England when war broke out again in 1701. During Queen Anne's War, he was with March in the Northeast Coast Campaign (1703).

60|$|Darkness {{had set in}} now, and Ney, {{finding it}} {{impossible}} {{to make his way}} further, and feeling sure that had the Emperor been still at Krasnoi he would have sent a force to his assistance, fell back into the forest. His position was a desperate one; the scanty supply of provisions with which they had started was exhausted, and they were in an unknown country, surrounded by foes, without a guide, without carriage for the wounded, without an idea of the direction in which to march. The Russian general sent in two <b>flags</b> <b>of</b> <b>truce,</b> offering him terms of capitulation which would save the life of himself and of his brave soldiers. Ney, however, was not yet conquered. He detained the messengers with the <b>flags</b> <b>of</b> <b>truce,</b> lest they might take news to their general of the position of his force, and then, with all capable of the exertion, continued his march. They passed in silence within half a mile of the Cossack fires, and reaching a village on the Dnieper, attempted the passage; but the ice broke under the first gun, and it was necessary to abandon the whole of the artillery and every vehicle.|$|R
5|$|The two Italian cruisers {{approached}} {{the harbor and}} fired a blank shot at the Ottoman vessels lying there. Upon sighting the Italian ships, the Ottoman commander on Avnillah sent out a launch under a <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>truce</b> {{to communicate with the}} enemy. While negotiating, the Ottoman commander ordered Angora to position itself near the harbor's mole. At 07:30, Admiral Revel ordered the Ottoman launch to return with an ultimatum addressed to the Wāli of Beirut informing him to surrender his two warships by 09:00. The message was received by the Wali at 08:30. The Wali {{was in the process of}} issuing an order of surrender but this was not received by the Italians by the deadline. Accordingly, at 09:00, the Italians began their attack on the Ottoman ships in the harbor.|$|E
5|$|Sailing from Malacca on 20 November, Pellew's {{squadron}} {{passed along}} the Javan coast for 15 days, reaching Panka Point on 5 December and sending a boat under a <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>truce</b> into Griessie with {{instructions for the}} Dutch commander to surrender his ships. Captain Cowell refused, and ordered the boat party to be arrested. He then sent a Dutch officer aboard Culloden to inform Pellew of his actions. In response, Pellew determined to attack the port and ordered that Culloden and Powerful be lightened by the removal of unnecessary stores {{to enable them to}} sail into the shallow straits. On 6 December, the British squadron moved steadily towards Griessie through the Madura Strait, coming under fire from heated cannonballs from a battery of nine cannon situated at Sambelangan on Madura Island. Returning fire with his full squadron, Pellew rapidly silenced the battery without loss or significant damage to his ships and as the squadron approached Griessie, a message from the civilian governor in Sourabaya reached Pellew, reversing Cowell's orders, releasing the captured boat party and unconditionally surrendering the ships in the harbour.|$|E
5|$|Unknown to Montgomery, he was {{promoted}} to major general on December 9 for his victories at St. Johns and Montreal. After Montgomery was unable to convince Carleton to surrender, he placed several mortars a few hundred yards outside the walls of the city. The shelling of the city began on December 9, but after several days it had failed to make a serious impact on the walls, the garrison, or the civilian population. With the shelling having little effect, Montgomery ordered the emplacement of another battery closer towards the city walls, on the Plains of Abraham, despite the fact it offered little natural cover from returning fire. On December 15, the new batteries were ready and Montgomery sent a party of men under the <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>truce</b> to ask for the city's surrender. However, they were turned away. Montgomery then resumed firing on the city, but the effect was little better. When the new batteries were hit by more effective fire from the British, Montgomery ordered their evacuation.|$|E

50|$|At this point, Providencia’s {{residents}} {{sent out}} two <b>flags</b> <b>of</b> <b>truce,</b> requesting terms. The next day (25 May), Díaz accepted {{the surrender of}} the fort along with 40 guns, 380 slaves, and all English goods on the island. The 770 inhabitants surrendered on the understanding they would be repatriated to Europe; the Spanish commander-in-chief installed a new garrison under Vice Admiral de Ojeda. Díaz’s fleet then prepared to weigh, except for the Portuguese Ajuda, which attempted to desert its Spanish consorts but was wrecked on Providencia’s reefs. Furious, Díaz ordered two of its officers shot and their bodies displayed on the twisted wreckage {{as a warning to}} other wouldbe runaways.|$|R
5|$|Once his {{squadron}} {{arrived in}} Tripoli, Silvori sent the Tritone {{into the harbor}} under a <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>truce</b> in order to begin negotiations with Karamanli's government. With assurances from the resident British consul {{that they would be}} safe, Silvori went ashore on the 26th and met the Tripolitanian envoy, General Haggi Mohammed. Although negotiations at first seemed to be going well, the next day Karamanli sent a note with suggested terms that essentially abrogated the peace treaty that British Admiral Edward Pellew had negotiated on Sardinia's behalf after the Bombardment of Algiers in 1816. Seeing that Karamanli had no intention of offering acceptable terms, Sivori decided his best course of action would be to attack Tripoli. Before returning to his squadron Sivori managed to get the British consul to take under his protection what Sardinians remained in Tripoli. Salvori's force had a significant advantage over the Tripolitanian fleet, which only had a 12-gun brig and a pair of 6-gun schooners defending the harbor. Despite the disadvantage in naval power, Karamanli had significant forces ashore and several forts and shore batteries defending the harbor. Upon returning to his vessel, Salvori gave Karamanli a four-hour ultimatum that he would bombard the city unless better peace terms were offered by the Tripolitanians.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the battle, Linois used overland messengers to request {{the assistance of}} the Spanish fleet at Cadiz under Admiral Jose de Mazzaredo. Linois and Saumarez also embarked on a program of refitting and repairing their damaged squadrons in preparation for a resumption of the action. At Gibraltar, the wounded were transferred to the naval hospital and the dead buried in the gravesite later to be known as Trafalgar Cemetery. Saumarez ordered that the most damaged of the surviving ships, Pompée and Caesar, be laid up in dock and their crews distributed among the remaining ships to ensure that they could be repaired as rapidly as possible, a situation made necessary in part due to the seizure of many of Gibraltar's shipwrights in the Bay of Gibraltar when they were sent to aid Hannibal in the last stages of the battle. The entire squadron needed extensive repairs, their requirements met by Captain Alexander Ball, naval commissioner at Gibraltar. Captain Jahleel Brenton of Caesar protested this order and Saumarez permitted him to continue with repairs: Caesars crew worked all day and in regular shifts throughout the night for the next week to ensure that when Saumarez sailed again, Caesar sailed with him, the crew having replaced the ship's damaged masts in just four days. Saumarez also sent a boat under a <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>truce</b> in to Algeciras to arrange for the repatriation under parole of Ferris and his officers. Following a brief correspondence between Linois and the British admiral, the captured British officers, including Ferris and Cochrane, were sent to Gibraltar, later joined by the wounded British sailors captured on Hannibal. Ferris was immediately sent to Britain on HMS Plymouth with despatches, to await the court-martial for the loss of his ship. He and his officers were completely exonerated.|$|E
5|$|With Willoughby's ambush plan ruined, the {{scattered}} boats sought to rejoin Nereide, passing directly through the French squadron. Although several boats {{were in danger}} of being run down by the French ships and one even bumped alongside Minerve, all eventually rejoined Nereide safely. However, the opportunity to cause significant damage to the French in the narrow channel had been lost, with Bellone joining the squadron in passing through the channel with minimal resistance. In addition to British losses in the explosion at the fort, two men had been killed and one wounded on Nereide. French losses were more severe, Minerve suffered 23 casualties and Ceylon eight. With both sides recognising that further action was inevitable, Willoughby sent a boat to Sirius requesting additional assistance and Duperré sent a message overland with Lieutenant Morice, requesting support from Hamelin's squadron (Morice fell from his horse during the mission and was severely injured). Command of Victor passed to Henri Moisson. In the afternoon, Willoughby used mortars on Île de la Passe to shell the French squadron, forcing Duperré to retreat into the shallow harbour at Grand Port and Willoughby subsequently sent officers into Grand Port on 21 August under a <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>truce,</b> demanding the release of Victor, which he insisted had surrendered and should thus be handed over to the blockade squadron as a prize. Duperré refused to consider the request. One French ship had failed to enter the channel off Grand Port: the captured East Indiaman Windham. Early on 21 August, her French commander attempted to shelter in Rivière Noire. Sirius spotted the merchant ship under the batteries there and sent two boats into the anchorage, stormed the ship and brought her out without a single casualty, despite the boarding party having forgotten to take any weapons with them and being only armed with wooden foot-stretchers wielded as clubs.|$|E

25|$|On the Batavian {{right wing}} of General Daendels, {{absolutely}} nothing happened that day, as the inundations made his lines impenetrable.

As on the Batavian left wing the battle had clearly started, Daendels considered this an abuse of the <b>flag</b> <b>of</b> <b>truce.</b> Besides, Don turned out to have papers on his person that could be considered to be of a seditious nature. Daendels therefore arrested Don as a spy and sent him to Brune's headquarters. Don was incarcerated in the fortress of Lille and only years later exchanged for the Irish rebel James Napper Tandy.|$|E
