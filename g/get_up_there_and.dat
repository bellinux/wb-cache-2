Ebert endorsed Barack Obama for re-election as President in 2012.|$|E

500|$|The song's {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Anthony Mandler, and shot on an indoor soundstage in Castaic, California on April 23, 2008. The concept for the video was [...] "high-end erotica". In an interview with James Montgomery for MTV News whilst on set of the music video, Levine provided a summary of what the video would entail, saying: [...] "It's this kind of ultra-glamorous, photography-based, late-'70s/ early-'80s situation. It's really stylish and really beautiful... It's the most choreographed thing I've ever done, because usually I just <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> screw around. But with Rihanna, it's completely different and so cool." [...] In response, Rihanna continued to say that [...] "I don't {{do a lot of}} videos where I have so much chemistry with the other artist, and this is only my second duet in a video... It's really intense, because you have to work with each other so much. It's new for me, but I'm enjoying it." ...|$|E

Sometimes this move sees the first wrestler climb up on the turnbuckle himself getting even higher before the second wrestler <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> jumps off him.|$|R
5000|$|Joel Stroetzel stated about Adam's stage {{personality}} saying: [...] "Adam {{likes to}} take the piss out of things. Just {{wants to have a}} good time—kind of act like an asshole, but in a funny way. He likes to get people going, egg the crowd on. He <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> calls the crowd ‘pussies’ and all this stuff. But coming from a guy wearing short shorts and a cape, you gotta take things like that in stride." ...|$|R

Mariah Carey, who was often compared to Houston, said, [...] "She [...] {{has been a}} big influence on me." [...] She later told USA Today that [...] "none of us would sound the same if Aretha Franklin hadn't ever put out a record, or Whitney Houston hadn't." [...] Celine Dion who was the third member of the troika that dominated female pop singing in the 1990s, did a telephone interview with Good Morning America on February 13, 2012, saying [...] "Whitney's been an amazing inspiration for me. I've been singing with her my whole career, actually. I wanted to have a career like hers, sing like her, look beautiful like her." [...] Beyoncé told the Globe and Mail that Houston [...] "inspired [...] to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> do what [...] did". She also wrote on her website on the day after Houston's death, [...] "I, like every singer, always wanted to be just like [...] Her voice was perfect. Strong but soothing. Soulful and classic. Her vibrato, her cadence, her control. So many of my life's memories are attached to a Whitney Houston song. She is our queen and she opened doors and provided a blueprint for all of us." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Saddler. [...] "Mr. Chairman, we've got ONE clean man left, anyway, out of {{the late}} aristocracy; and he needs money, and deserves it. I move that you appoint Jack Halliday to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> auction off that sack of gilt twenty-dollar pieces, and give the result to the right man--the man whom Hadleyburg delights to honour--Edward Richards." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the other}} hand, Mr. Choate is descended from those Puritans who {{landed on a}} bitter night in December. Every year those people used to meet at a great banquet in New York, and those masters of mind in oratory had to make speeches. It was Doctor Depew's {{business}} to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> apologise for the Dutch, and Mr. Choate {{had to get up}} later and explain the crimes of the Puritans, and grand, beautiful times we used to have.|$|E

5000|$|Oldsmobile's Bob Somers {{recalled}} a meeting he attended with Beltz at the GM building in downtown Detroit, introducing the XP-90, {{otherwise known as}} the [...] "all-plastic" [...] car. After Beltz and Somers' presentation, the board turned the proposed project down, and Somers said, [...] "Roche's M., chairman of the GM board at the time man <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> and he's got a flimsy overhead transparency. It's got figures I can't even read - little tiny numbers... the guy <b>gets</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> goes whish, right through it. He gets all done and nobody knows what he said. Roche says, 'And that's why we're {{not going to do}} it.' And John says, 'Jesus Christ, not only can I not read it, I didn't understand it.' Right in front of the chairman of the board... So that was John Beltz." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But they won't {{disappear}} {{before the}} school concert. How am I to <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> recite? You {{know there is}} one line in my recitation, 'She waved her lily-white hand,' and I have to wave mine when I say it. Fancy waving a lily-white hand all covered with warts. I've tried every remedy I ever heard of, but nothing does any good. Judy Pineau said if I rubbed them with toad-spit it would take them away for sure. But how am I to get any toad-spit?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll set {{you right}} on that point very quick. People take the figurative {{language}} of the Bible and the allegories for literal, {{and the first thing}} they ask for when they get here is a halo and a harp, and so on. Nothing that's harmless and reasonable is refused a body here, if he asks it in the right spirit. So they are outfitted with these things without a word. They go and sing and play just about one day, and that's the last you'll ever see them in the choir. They don't need anybody to tell them that that sort of thing wouldn't make a heaven--at least not a heaven that a sane man could stand a week and remain sane. That cloud-bank is placed where the noise can't disturb the old inhabitants, and so there ain't any harm in letting everybody <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> cure himself as soon as he comes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{day after}} his death, {{on the first day}} of Eliminations, his {{opponent}} Tony Schumacher, performed drag racing's version of a [...] "missing man" [...] formation, idling down the track out of respect to Johnson. During the final round, event winner Cory McClenethan, who was in the lane opposite Johnson during his last ride down the track, stated very clearly, [...] "And I'll tell you something else, when I <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> get that trophy, it's going to Alan Johnson.

5000|$|... "Man, listen, it's so {{sensitive}} {{and it will}} reveal its secrets {{if you try to}} <b>get</b> <b>up</b> in <b>there</b> <b>and</b> learn it...and learn the sound and contact. You can't play it like a piano 'cause that's another thing all together - The notes are the same but, see, that electricity puts another 'jammie' on you, you know what I mean? You must deal with touch and so many other thing...and I was very frustrated at first." ...|$|R
5000|$|The next theme, Motown, {{proved to}} be a {{challenge}} for Gear. She sang [...] "Sir Duke" [...] by Stevie Wonder and although she received mediocre comments from the judges, she was safe and without a trip to the bottom three. Some of the judges' comments include [...] "This girl can really sing," [...] from Zach Werner and [...] "You <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> you just have this vibe about you, and you be Jenny. You can't judge Jenny Gear. It's just impossible," [...] from Jake Gold.|$|E

We know you've endorsed him, but don't <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> say it's your moral obligation that you go on Tuesday to vote for Jim Florio.'" [...] After public outcry and calls for an investigation, Rollins partially retracted some of these claims telling People magazine (March 31, 1997, Vol. 47, No. 12) that his comments were [...] "an exaggeration {{that turned out to}} be inaccurate." ...|$|E

[...] To compound matters, the game was played in Bright's home ballpark, Yankee Stadium.|$|E
5000|$|On the MuchMusic appearance, Alannah Currie {{spoke about}} some of the unused {{features}} of the video. [...] "The video was funny.

And then they built this enormous 12 foot skirt, I wanted to have these men coming out from under my skirt, and they edited that down to make it a bit more acceptable. I wanted to be the original hell's angel, it didn't quite come off. I always get disappointed by our videos." ...|$|R
