5|$|Normal {{coagulation}} is {{initiated by}} the release of tissue factor from damaged tissue. Tissue factor binds to circulating factor VIIa. The combination activates factor X to factor Xa and factor IX to factor IXa. Factor Xa (in the presence of factor V) activates prothrombin into thrombin.

40|$|A {{range of}} microgels with two {{different}} functionalities were synthesized, and their utility in novel bioapplications was examined. Cationic microgels with varying properties {{were developed by}} tuning synthesis conditions. Their size and primary amine content was analyzed, and one microgel system was selected as a model construct. Its primary amine groups were conjugated to two dyes with properties favorable for utilization as contrast agents in photoacoustic imaging. The concentration of contrast agent in single particles was determined. The implications of a high local dye concentration in the generation of high intensity photoacoustic signals, are discussed. The second bioapplication involved the targeted delivery of fibrinolytics to <b>fibrin</b> <b>clots,</b> {{in order to bring}} about dissolution of abnormal thrombi. For this purpose, core/shell microgels with carboxylic acid groups in their shells were synthesized in three size ranges. Following this, their dimension based differential localization in and around porous <b>fibrin</b> <b>clots</b> was examined. Fibrin-specific peptides were then conjugated onto the shells of these particles and the conjugates were shown to demonstrate strong interactions with the <b>fibrin</b> <b>clots.</b> The microgels conjugated to the peptide with the highest binding affinity to fibrin, were observed to bring about disruption of <b>fibrin</b> <b>clots,</b> merely through interference in the dynamic interactions among clot fibers, due to the equilibrium nature of the fibrin polymer.

40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} {{standardised}} and reproducible model of intra-abdominal infection and abscess formation in rats. Design: Experimental study. Setting: University hospital, The Netherlands. Subjects: 36 adult male Wistar rats. Interventions: In 32 rats, peritonitis was produced using two different concentrations of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis) incorporated in <b>fibrin</b> <b>clots</b> (E. coli: 1 x 10 (5) {{colony forming units}} (CFU) /ml or 1 x 10 (8) CFU/ml, B. fragilis: 1 x 10 (8) CFU/ml). Four rats with <b>fibrin</b> <b>clots</b> without bacteria served as uninfected controls. Main outcome measurements: Macroscopy and bacterial counts in peritoneal fluid, blood, and <b>fibrin</b> <b>clots</b> after 24 hours, 4 days, 7 days, and 4 weeks. Results: Macroscopically, {{there were signs of}} intra-abdominal infection and abscesses. With the higher starting concentration of E. coli, macroscopic signs were more pronounced and in nearly all rats bacterial counts in peritoneal fluid and <b>fibrin</b> <b>clots</b> showed persistently high numbers of E. coli and B. fragilis for at least 7 days (E. coli = 2 x 10 (3) to 1 x 10 (6) CFU/ml and 5 x 10 (7) to 9 x 10 (8) CFU/clot; B. fragilis = 1 x 10 (3) to 1 x 10 (6) CFU/ml and 5 x 10 (7) to 6 x 10 (8) CFU/clot).

25|$|Normal {{platelets}} {{can respond}} to an abnormality on the vessel wall rather than to hemorrhage, resulting in inappropriate platelet adhesion/activation and thrombosis: {{the formation of a}} clot within an intact vessel. This type of thrombosis arises by mechanisms different than those of a normal clot: namely, extending the <b>fibrin</b> <b>clot</b> of venous thrombosis; extending an unstable or ruptured arterial plaque, causing arterial thrombosis; and microcirculatory thrombosis. An arterial thrombus may partially obstruct blood flow, causing downstream ischemia, or may completely obstruct it, causing downstream tissue death.|$|E
25|$|Under homeostatic conditions, {{the body}} is {{maintained}} in a finely tuned balance of coagulation and fibrinolysis. The activation of the coagulation cascade yields thrombin that converts fibrinogen to fibrin; the stable <b>fibrin</b> <b>clot</b> being the final product of hemostasis. The fibrinolytic system then functions to break down fibrinogen and fibrin. Activation of the fibrinolytic system generates plasmin (in the presence of thrombin), {{which is responsible for}} the lysis of fibrin clots. The breakdown of fibrinogen and fibrin results in polypeptides called fibrin degradation products (FDPs) or fibrin split products (FSPs). In a state of homeostasis, the presence of plasmin is critical, as it is the central proteolytic enzyme of coagulation and is also necessary for the breakdown of clots, or fibrinolysis.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{function}} of platelets is {{to contribute to}} hemostasis: the process of stopping bleeding {{at the site of}} interrupted endothelium. They gather at the site and unless the interruption is physically too large, they plug the hole. First, platelets attach to substances outside the interrupted endothelium: adhesion. Second, they change shape, turn on receptors and secrete chemical messengers: activation. Third, they connect to each other through receptor bridges: aggregation. Formation of this platelet plug (primary hemostasis) is associated with activation of the coagulation cascade with resultant fibrin deposition and linking (secondary hemostasis). These processes may overlap: the spectrum is from a predominantly platelet plug, or [...] "white clot" [...] to a predominantly <b>fibrin</b> <b>clot,</b> or [...] "red clot" [...] or the more typical mixture. The final result is the clot. Some would add the subsequent clot retraction and platelet inhibition as fourth and fifth steps to the completion of the process and still others a sixth step wound repair.|$|E
40|$|The {{penetration}} of ceftazidime, administered in {{a dose of}} 100 mg/kg intramuscularly, into cardiac vegetations and subcutaneously implanted <b>fibrin</b> <b>clots</b> was compared in rabbits with experimental Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis. Significant pharmacokinetic differences between the time-concentration curves for the two compartments were observed. Concentrations of ceftazidime in vegetations peaked at 30 min after dosing at a level slightly lower than that in plasma and thereafter declined in parallel with concentrations in plasma throughout the 8 -h sampling period. Concentrations in <b>fibrin</b> <b>clots</b> increased more slowly than those in plasma and vegetations, reaching a maximum at 120 min. This {{was followed by a}} slow elimination phase yielding concentrations in excess of concurrent plasma and vegetation levels and a greater area under the curve. These features were observed for both large (2 -ml volume) and small (0. 1 -ml volume) clots. Contrary to previous reports, these observations suggest that <b>fibrin</b> <b>clots</b> do not provide an accurate model for predicting antibiotic concentrations in cardiac vegetations produced in endocarditis and that concentrations of antimicrobial agents in vegetations can be predicted more accurately from concomitant plasma levels...|$|R

30|$|Although skin graft {{fixation}} using {{fibrin sealant}} has proved useful for graft take, fibrin sealant is not widely used compared with sutures or skin staples, {{primarily due to}} difficulty in obtaining sealant containing low-concentration thrombin. Fibrin sealant contains thrombin and fibrinogen as active components; when these 2 ingredients are mixed, <b>fibrin</b> <b>clots</b> are formed (Sierra et al. 2000). When thrombin concentration is high, <b>fibrin</b> <b>clots</b> are formed quickly, whereas, when thrombin concentration is low, they are formed slowly. According to previous studies, low-concentration fibrin sealant containing approximately 4  IU/mL thrombin is recommended because <b>fibrin</b> <b>clots</b> are formed slowly, permitting graft placement. In addition, because such sealant is easy to manipulate, the graft take rate can be enhanced (Mittermayr et al. 2006; Grabosch et al. 1994). When undiluted fibrin sealant which contains a thrombin concentration of 400  IU/mL {{is applied to the}} human body, clots are formed quickly; thus, such sealant is used clinically as a hemostatic agent. Some fibrin sealants containing 4  IU/mL thrombin are restrictedly available in Europe. As an alternative, autologous blood can be collected to prepare the sealant, but the preparation process is complicated and time-consuming.|$|R
