40|$|This work {{presents}} the experimental validation and updating of a flexible multibody model ideated for {{taking into account}} <b>installation</b> <b>conditions</b> of industrial serial planar manipulators without resorting to cumbersome modeling. The flexibility of the frame, the manipulator is fixed to, is modeled over {{the flexibility of the}} joints, that is introduced as lumped stiffness. In particular, the flexible frame is included in the model by using a Component Mode Synthesis methodology, in which only the natural modes of vibration and the static constrain modes are accounted. The flexible multibody model has been developed because these commercial machines are mainly used to perform low-speed tasks, and they are designed by taking into account their flexibility at most in the joints. Unfortunately, there are particular <b>installation</b> <b>conditions</b> in which even low-speed tasks can generate low-frequency vibrations that highly interfere with the task.

The experimental tests consist of several modal analyses, together with acceleration and laser Doppler measurements in operational conditions. This methodology takes into account the <b>installation</b> <b>conditions</b> through the model of the flexible frame, and gives a tool for studying ad-hoc solutions which prevent the occurrence of unwanted low-frequency vibrations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, the {{dynamics}} of a SensAble Tech-nologies PHANToM Premium 1. 5 haptic device is experi-mentally identified and analyzed. Towards this purpose, the dynamic model derived in [1] is augmented with a friction model and is linearly parameterized. The identified model predicts joint torques with over 95 % accuracy and produces an inertia matrix that is confirmed to be positive-definite within the device workspace. In addition, user hand force estimates with and without including the identified dynamics are compared with the measured values. The experiments are also conducted for other typical <b>installation</b> <b>conditions</b> of the device, such as with force sensor mounted at the end-effector, using gimbal and counter-balance weight, and upside-down installation of the device. The contribution of different dynamic terms such as inertial, Coriolis and centrifugal, gravitational, and Coulomb and viscous friction for different installations are demonstrated and discussed. The identified dynamic model {{can be used for}} hand force estimation, accurate gravity counter balancing for different <b>installation</b> <b>conditions,</b> and model-based control systems design for haptic simulation and teleoperation applications.

Measurements of specific boundary resistance and specific boundary reactance on commercial acoustic materials, using the auto-spectra and cross-spectra functions of a sound intensity p-p probe, were done with the purpose of determining the sound diffuse field absorption coefficient from experimental data.
