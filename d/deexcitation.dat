5000|$|The {{mechanism}} underlying {{this phenomenon}} is not fully understood. However, the phenomenon of persistent luminescence must not be mistaken with fluorescence and phosphorescence (see for definitions [...] and [...] ). Indeed, in fluorescence, the lifetime of the excited state is {{in the order of}} a few nanoseconds and in phosphorescence, even if the lifetime of the emission can reach several seconds, the reason of the long emission is due to the <b>deexcitation</b> between two electronic states of different spin multiplicity. For persistent luminescence, it has been {{known for a long time}} that the phenomenon involved energy traps (such as electron or hole trap) in a material which are filled during the excitation. After the end of the excitation, the stored energy is gradually released to emitter centers which emit light usually by a fluorescence-like mechanism.|$|E
5000|$|The {{physical}} process {{that cause the}} propagation of a hadron shower are considerably different from the processes in electromagnetic showers.

Neutral pions amount, on average to 1/3 of the produced pions and their energy is dissipated in the form of electromagnetic showers.

40|$|We {{describe}} a novel application of laser-spectroscopy {{to investigate the}} electric fields and the properties of relatively dilute plasmas under high-power pulses at the nanosecond time scale. The method is based on resonant laser-pumping combined with electron excitations and <b>deexcitations</b> by the plasma electrons, which allows for simultaneous observations of various line intensities (due to both allowed and forbidden transitions). These observations, together with novel line-shape calculations recently developed, allow for obtaining the electron density, electron temperature, and electric fields.

The study is carried out in a coaxialpulsed-plasma configuration (a Plasma Opening Switch).

5000|$|Among the {{properties}} listed above, the light output {{is the most}} important, as it affects both the efficiency and {{the resolution of the}} detector (the efficiency is the ratio of detected particles to the total number of particles impinging upon the detector; the energy resolution is the ratio of the full width at half maximum of a given energy peak to the peak position, usually expressed in %). The light output is a strong function of the type of incident particle or photon and of its energy, which therefore strongly influences the type of scintillation material to be used for a particular application. The presence of quenching effects results in reduced light output (i.e., reduced scintillation efficiency). Quenching refers to all radiationless <b>deexcitation</b> processes in which the excitation is degraded mainly to heat. The overall signal production efficiency of the detector, however, also depends on the quantum efficiency of the PMT (typically ~30% at peak), and on the efficiency of light transmission and collection (which depends on the type of reflector material covering the scintillator and light guides, the length/shape of the light guides, any light absorption, etc.). The light output is often quantified as a number of scintillation photons produced per keV of deposited energy. Typical numbers are (when the incident particle is an electron): ≈40 photons/keV for , ~10 photons/keV for plastic scintillators, and ~8 photons/keV for bismuth germanate (...) [...]|$|E

40|$|Efficient {{detection}} of spectator fragments {{is key to}} the main topics at an electron-ion collider (eIC).

Whereas he could measure the ∼ 4 MeV energy loss by the electron due to excitation of nuclear energy levels (Figure 1), even the energy spread of the incident beam would prevent such an inclusive selection of quasielastic events at an eIC. The only available tool is fragment detection. Since, in our example, one finds that ∼ 100 % of <b>deexcitations</b> go through γ’s or 1 neutron, rarely to 2 neutron and never to protons(due to Coulomb barrier suppression), the eIC design should emphasize their detection.

In the present work spin-labeling techniques, specifically the use of electron-spin-polarized metastable He(23 S) atoms, coupled with spin analysis of the ejected electrons, are used to probe the dynamics of He(23 S) <b>deexcitation</b> at a variety of surfaces. Such measurements, coupled with studies of the <b>deexcitation</b> of He(21 S) and He(23 P) atoms at Cu(100) and Au(100) show that each species deexcites exclusively through resonance ionization followed by Auger neutralization. The data also provide the first direct confirmation of spin correlation in the Auger neutralization of ions outside a paramagnetic surface. Two proposed models for spin correlation are discussed and potential experimental tests for distinguishing between them are suggested. Studies of SPMDS at surfaces comprising layers of Ar or Xe atoms frozen onto a cryogenically cooled substrate are described and exhibit behavior similar to that observed in gas phase Penning ionization studies indicating that ejection results, in part, from surface Penning ionization (SPI).
