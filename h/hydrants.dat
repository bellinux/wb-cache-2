5|$|On {{the night}} of 6November 1995, a fire {{broke out in the}} Rova compound, {{destroying}} or severely damaging all of its buildings. Once the flames had been extinguished, all that remained of the original structures were the stone shells of the royal chapel and Manjakamiadana. Fire-fighters arrived late at the scene. Their capacity to douse the fire was hampered by the discovery that their fire hoses did not properly fit onto the nearby <b>hydrants.</b> In addition, the water pressure at the <b>hydrants</b> was significantly reduced due to Analamanga hilltop's high elevation. As the fire-fighters battled the flames, numerous bystanders ran into Rova compound buildings to retrieve artefacts of historic and cultural significance. Approximately 1,675 objects were saved out of an estimated total of 6,700. Some pillaging is believed to have occurred. On {{the night of}} the fire, the body of one of the queens was found in the public square in the centre of the city. A funeral vigil was held the following day for these royal remains. The remains were later identified as belonging to Ranavalona III, and have since been re-interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga.|$|E
5|$|Experimental {{electric}} fire-engines {{were made}} for testing in France, Germany and England starting {{in the latter part}} of the nineteenth century. Siemens Brothers Company of London built and experimented with an electric fire engine in 1891. It was shown at the Royal Naval Exhibition in England in 1892. The Paris Fire Department experimented with a self-propelled electric fire engine in 1899. The French electric fire engine, known to them as the automobile pump, was first exhibited at the 1900 World's Fair in Paris and became very popular during its first six months of successful operation. It was demonstrated that this electric fire-engine allowed firemen to begin to extinguish a fire four minutes earlier than a steam fire engine. The fire-engine was self-propelled by on board batteries, and carried a water tank with hundreds of gallons of water that could be used immediately at the site of the fire. The hoses were then connected to the city fire <b>hydrants</b> for more water if needed for a large fire. In 1901, the Paris Fire Department put an electric fire engine into successful operation that also had a hook-and-ladder wagon. It had an electric motor-driven water pump to which hoses were attached for the firemen to use.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix {{played a}} notable {{role in the}} {{response}} to the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. At 5:04 pm on October 17, 1989, a major earthquake rumbled through the San Francisco Bay Area. One of the hardest-hit locations was the Marina District of San Francisco; a densely populated neighborhood built up primarily in the 1920s on rubble, sand and debris dumped {{at the edge of the}} bay following the 1906 earthquake. A number of buildings collapsed, and firefighters were called to rescue trapped residents. Subsequent to a sharp aftershock, a fire broke out in a three-story building at Divisadero and Jefferson, threatening nearby buildings. Fire engines connected their hoses to the city's seawater-based Auxiliary Water Supply System (AWSS) and began to quench the fire, but an explosion caused the structure to collapse onto the fire hydrant. Fire crews were forced back, and with the assistance of off-duty police and civilian volunteers they ran hoses four blocks away to alternate sources. Further explosions caused other structures to collapse onto the newly laid hoses. At about the same time, other fire companies in the Marina were reporting water pressure problems with both the AWSS and the regular municipal water system. The AWSS was suffering from broken underground lines and from a 20% loss in stored water volume—both from earthquake damage—and from broken high pressure <b>hydrants</b> caused by building collapses. At 6:16 pm Phoenix was called to assist.|$|E

5|$|The flood made {{national}} news. The {{most familiar}} footage is possibly {{of the fire}} that started on April 19 in downtown Grand Forks, surrounded by floodwaters, where eleven buildings and sixty apartments were destroyed. The Grand Forks Herald building was totally destroyed in the fire, along with 120 years of archives. Firefighters {{were not able to}} begin extinguishing the fire immediately as they had to evacuate nearly forty people in one of the nearby apartment complexes who had defied the evacuation order. Additionally, their tankers were unable to reach the buildings due to the height of the floodwater and the water pressure from the hoses and fire <b>hydrants</b> was too weak to extinguish the flames. The National Guard placed the fire trucks on several tractor-trailers to prevent them from flooding, which allowed the firefighters to assist in extinguishing the fire. Also, two aircraft rescue and firefighting trucks from the Grand Forks International Airport were brought in to fight the fire because their engines were higher up off the ground, and thus did not get clogged by the flood waters. The firefighters received assistance several hours after the fire started by a fire-bombing plane that dropped retardant and helicopters who made sixty drops totaling 120,000 gallons of water. Three of the firefighters were treated for hypothermia after treading through the cold temperatures of the flood water. The fire was later determined to have been caused by an electrical problem that had resulted from the large amounts of floodwater.|$|E

5000|$|Fire <b>hydrant</b> meters are a {{specialized}} type of portable turbine meter {{attached to a}} fire <b>hydrant</b> to measure water flowing out of the <b>hydrant.</b> The meters are normally made of aluminium to keep their weight low and usually have a 3" [...] capacity.

In any case, periodic inspection of lubricants is recommended. Lubrication is generally done with a food-grade non-petroleum lubricant to avoid contamination of the distribution system.|$|R

50|$|Aircraft refuelers can {{be either}} a {{self-contained}} fuel truck, or a <b>hydrant</b> truck or cart. Fuel trucks are self-contained, typically containing up to 10,000 US gallons of fuel and have their own pumps, filters, hoses, and other equipment. A <b>hydrant</b> cart or truck hooks into a central pipeline network and provides fuel to the aircraft. There is a significant advantage with <b>hydrant</b> systems when compared to fuel trucks, as fuel trucks must be periodically replenished.|$|R
40|$|Background: Dehydration {{occurs when}} the body loses fluids at a greater rate than it takes in. For some patients, {{achieving}} an acceptable fluid balance is difficult without assistance and they rely on interventions by health professionals. Literature indicates that dehydration {{has long been a}} well researched area; however, there is still an apparent lack of knowledge throughout healthcare staff and evidence from more recent publications indicate that this remains a prevalent issue within nursing care. Aim: To undertake an acceptability study of the <b>Hydrant</b> with elderly inpatients. Methods: A qualitative study was undertaken to explore the acceptability and ease of use of a ‘novel’ hands free drinking aid called the <b>Hydrant.</b> After experiencing difficulties in recruitment, a revised study was designed. This used a sample of 20 participants from a Health Care of the Older Person ward. Structured face to face interviews were conducted {{with the use of a}} recording sheet. The interview compromised of open and closed questions as well as rating scales. These were designed to ascertain the participants’ normal drinking habits as well as their views on the acceptability and ease of use of the <b>Hydrant.</b> Findings: The research gave an interesting insight into what and when patients usually drank. When initially presented with the <b>Hydrant</b> participants gave many positive comments however when the opportunity arose to use the <b>Hydrant</b> participants experienced great difficulty. After receiving some training they found the <b>Hydrant</b> easier to use however many still struggled. Conclusion: The study outcomes showed that the <b>Hydrant</b> was not a usable product for the elderly who had either poor sucking ability and/or poor bite. The <b>Hydrant</b> was also poor in terms of acceptability, 90 % of participants preferred to use a traditional water jug instead of the <b>Hydrant...</b>|$|R

25|$|One {{reason for}} the fire's {{duration}} {{was the lack of}} national standards in fire-fighting equipment. Although fire engines from nearby cities (such as Philadelphia and Washington, as well as units from New York, Wilmington, and Atlantic City) responded, many were useless because their hose couples failed to fit Baltimore <b>hydrants.</b> As a result, the fire burned over 30 hours, destroying 1,526 buildings and spanning 70 city blocks.|$|E
