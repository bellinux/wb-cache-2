25|$|In 1820, Godwin {{published}} Of Population: An Enquiry Concerning the Power of Increase in the Numbers of Mankind as a rebuttal to Malthus' essays. Godwin's main {{argument was}} against Malthus' notion that population tends to grow exponentially. Godwin believed that for population to double every twenty-five years (as Malthus had asserted {{had occurred in}} the United States, due to the expanse of resources available there), every married couple {{would have to have}} at least eight children, given the rate of childhood deaths. Godwin himself was one of thirteen children, but he did not observe the majority of couples in his day having eight children. He therefore concluded:In reality, if I had not taken up the pen with the express purpose of confuting all the errors of Mr Malthus’s book, and of endeavouring to introduce other principles, more cheering, more favourable to the best interests of mankind, and better prepared to resist the inroads of vice and misery, I might close my argument here, and lay down the pen with this brief remark, that, when this author shall have produced from any country, the United States of North America not excepted, a register of marriages and births, from which it shall appear that there are on an average eight births to a marriage, then, and not till then, can <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> just reason to admit his doctrine of the geometrical ratio.|$|E

"I {{have decided}} to act as co-counsel, and to make this opening statement, not because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> illusions about my legal abilities, but, rather, because {{there are things that}} I must say to you. I have spent many days and nights behind bars {{thinking}} about this trial, this outrage. And in my own mind, only someone who has been so intimately a victim of this madness as I have can do justice to what I have to say." ...|$|E
500|$|During the Verizon Ladies First Tour {{which also}} {{featured}} Alicia Keys, Missy Elliott and Tamia, Beyoncé performed [...] "Naughty Girl" [...] {{as part of}} the concert's set list. Before starting to sing, she asked the audience: [...] "Do <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> naughty girls in the house tonight? Her DJ yelled: [...] "Do the A-Town stomp!" [...] Beyoncé then walked onto the stage with some female dancers. As she sang, more dancers appeared on smaller, circular platforms while fire shot from the floor and a long, rectangular screen merged video of flames with images of the performers. Beyoncé then performed portions of Vanity 6's song [...] "Nasty Girl" [...] (1982) as a small dance break. The song was included on the set list of Beyoncé's Dangerously in Love World Tour that began in late 2003. During the tour, she appeared suspended from the ceiling of the arena and was lowered into a red lounger.|$|E

2500|$|On 9 October 2007, it was {{reported}} that Nobilo had announced he would be coming out of retirement, and attempt to gain a card for the U.S. PGA Tour through qualifying school. However, in a statement issued on the Golf Channel's website, Nobilo denied the report: [...] "I have not, nor did <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> intention of entering this years PGA Tour Qualifying school." ...|$|E
2500|$|After his crash at Spa, Stewart {{became an}} outspoken {{advocate}} for auto racing safety. Later, he explained, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> legacy {{to leave the}} sport I {{hope it will be}} seen to be an area of safety because when I arrived in Grand Prix racing so-called precautions and safety measures were diabolical." [...] By Stewart's reckoning, a driver who raced for five years had a two-thirds chance of being killed in a crash.|$|E
2500|$|Iravatham Mahadevan, another {{historian}} who supports the Dravidian hypothesis, says, [...] "we may hopefully {{find that the}} proto-Dravidian roots of the Harappan language and South Indian Dravidian languages are similar. This is a hypothesis [...] But I have no illusions that I will decipher the Indus script, nor do <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> regret". According to Mahadevan, a stone celt discovered in Mayiladuthurai (Tamil Nadu) has the same markings {{as that of the}} symbols of the Indus script. The celt dates to early 2nd millennium BCE, post-dating Harappan decline. Mahadevan considers this as evidence of the same language being used by the neolithic people of south India and the late Harappans.|$|E

2500|$|The writer Al Aronowitz, {{while working}} on a profile of Jane Fonda for The Saturday Evening Post in the 1960s, asked Henry Fonda about method acting: [...] "I can't {{articulate}} about the Method", he told me, [...] "because I never studied it. I don't mean to suggest that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> feelings {{one way or the}} other about it...I don't know what the Method is and I don't care what the Method is. Everybody's got a method. Everybody can't articulate about their method, and I can't, if I have a method—and Jane sometimes says that I use the Method, that is, the capital letter Method, without being aware of it. Maybe I do; it doesn't matter." ...|$|E
2500|$|The piano, Gould said, [...] "is not an {{instrument}} for which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> great love as such... I have played it all my life, {{and it is the}} best vehicle I have to express my ideas." [...] In the case of Bach, Gould admitted, [...] " [...] fixed the action in some of the instruments I play on—and the piano I use for all recordings is now so fixed—so that it is a shallower and more responsive action than the standard. It tends to have a mechanism which is rather like an automobile without power steering: you are in control and not it; it doesn't drive you, you drive it. This is the secret of doing Bach on the piano at all. You must have that immediacy of response, that control over fine definitions of things." ...|$|E
2500|$|For Yeats she was, like Maud Gonne, {{a poetic}} muse, whose {{resonate}} voice {{was perfect for}} reciting his poetry. He found in her [...] "a tranquil beauty like that of Demeter's image near the British Museum reading-room door, and an incomparable sense of rhythm and a beautiful voice, the seeming natural expression of the image." [...] In his review of A Sicilian Idyll, Yeats wrote, [...] "Mrs. Edward Emery (Florence Farr) …won universal praise with her striking beauty and subtle gesture and fine delivery of the verse. Indeed her acting was the feature of the whole performance that struck one most, after the verse itself. I {{do not know that}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> word too strong to express my admiration for its grace and power…I have never heard verse better spoken." [...] Both men wrote leading parts in their plays for Farr, who used her influence with Annie Horniman to have them produced.|$|E

2500|$|Despite a {{temporary}} cooling of {{tensions in the}} Irish camp after Keane's change of heart, things soon took {{a turn for the}} worse. Keane immediately gave an interview to leading sports journalist Tom Humphries, of the Irish Times newspaper, where he expressed his unhappiness with the facilities in Saipan and listed the events and concerns which had led him to leave the team temporarily. McCarthy took offence at Keane's interview and decided to confront Keane over the article in front of the entire squad and coaching staff. Keane refused to relent, saying that he had told the newspaper what he considered to be the truth and that the Irish fans deserved {{to know what was going}} on inside the camp. He then unleashed a stinging verbal tirade against McCarthy: [...] "Mick, you're a liar... you're a fucking wanker. I didn't rate you as a player, I don't rate you as a manager, and I don't rate you as a person. You're a fucking wanker and you can stick your World Cup up your arse. The only reason <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> dealings with you is that somehow you are the manager of my country! You can stick it up your bollocks." [...] Niall Quinn observed in his autobiography that [...] "Roy Keane's 10-minute oration ... was clinical, fierce, earth-shattering to the person on the end of it and it ultimately caused a huge controversy in Irish society." [...] But at the same time, he was also critical of Keane's stance, saying that, [...] " [...] left us in Saipan, not the other way round. And he punished himself more than any of us by not coming back." ...|$|E
