His guitar playing is loud and aggressive, uses pioneering distortion and feedback techniques, employs long solos, has shifts in volume and texture, and {{is driven by}} emotion and impulse. These characteristics were eagerly learned and applied by {{the new wave of}} 1960s British artists and later became basic attributes of blues-rock music and its offspring, hard rock and heavy metal music. Jeff Beck realized in the early 1960s that [...] "I didn't know a Strat could sound like that—until I heard Buddy's tracks on the Blues From Big Bill's Copa Cabana album" [...] (a reissue of the album 1963 Folk Festival of the Blues) and that [...] "It was the total manic abandon in Buddy's solos.

While wishing Uhtred could stop being used by so many larger forces and instead follow his own desires, Edmonds knows {{that would be the end}} of The Saxon Tales, and there are more tales to tell. [...] "It’s hard enough to write one novel, but it’s downright difficult to pen five of them consecutively with the same characters and themes and keep the writing fresh and interesting. 'Difficult' isn't even the word; 'impossible' <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> ... This is not to denigrate THE BURNING LAND in any way; it’s superior entertainment (if you like your entertainment blood-stained and brutal). Uhtred is a fully-realized character, capable of great bravery and great foolishness, mixed in with—as he might describe himself—the deviousness of Loki and the thunder of Thor’s hammer in battle. And Cornwell’s eye for period detail and his capacity for pulling off deft reverses are still in place, which helps to keep the narrative turning briskly along." ...|$|E
5000|$|The use of {{the term}} [...] "mysticism" [...] {{provoked}} hostility from the Roman Catholic Church, which used the term in the sense of being strictly limited to the spiritual sphere, without any political influence. But in Gianis conception of mysticism, he claimed it was in the political sphere without fear of overlap between the two worlds. Giani stated: [...] "Neither the Church should make policy, nor the State must make religion. Fascist Catholics, therefore, Catholics, or fascists, whichever <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> but Fascists: let us remember." [...] The Bishop Onofrio Buonocore stated that he viewed Fascist mysticism as [...] "the testimony of an Italy no longer divided, but renewed and reconciled under the papal insignia and littoriali". In February 1937, the Cardinal of Milan, Ildefonso Schuster, gave a speech at the School of Fascist Mysticism. Many years of friction took place between the Catholic Church and the Fascist Regime, erupting into open conflict in 1931, after Mussolinis withdrawal of several concessions his regime made to the Catholic Church in a 1929 Concordat.|$|E

Searching for integrable vortex pairs systems on Liouville surfaces is in order. The vortex pair system on a triaxial ellipsoid extends Jacobi's geodesics. Is it Arnold-Liouville integrable?

40|$|The {{protracted}} {{dispute over}} the degree of independence of language acquisition from sensory experience often degenerates into an unsavory cavalcade of exaggerated claims, tendentious rhetoric, and absurd parodies of opposing views. 1 In this chapter we try to distinguish between partisan polemics and research programs. If {{either side of the}} partisan dispute about the acquisition of syntax were as stupid as the opposing side alleges, the free-for-all would not be worthy of serious attention; but in fact we think there are two important complementary research programs for syntax acquisition involved here. We are skeptical about recent triumphalist claims for linguistic nativism, and this may lead to us being mistaken for defenders of some sort of “empiricism. ” 2 But touting empiricist stock is not our project.
