"The Doctor, the Widow and the Wardrobe" [...] {{was written}} by head writer and {{executive}} producer Steven Moffat, who {{wanted it to be}} [...] "the most Christmassy Christmas special ever". He stated that [...] "nothing is more fun to write" [...] than the Doctor at Christmas, as he considered it [...] "his kind of day. Everything's bright and shiny, everybody's having a laugh, and nobody minds <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> a really stupid hat". The story is partly inspired by The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (from The Chronicles of Narnia) by C. S. Lewis. Moffat said that Doctor Who and the Narnia stories [...] "come from the same impulse that children have of escaping to another world." ...|$|E
500|$|Midnight Heat was {{released}} in July 2012 following Heat Rush. It is packaged in a purple bottle. According to Beyoncé's official website, [...] "For , fragrance is an essential accessory to highlight your inner radiance, confidence and sex appeal. Midnight Heat is the ultimate evening scent, sensual and enticing with {{just a hint of}} mystery." [...] The perfume's top notes are described as dragonfruit, apricot and starfruit; middle notes of orchid, tulip and peony; and base notes of sandalwood, patchouli and amber. A poster for the fragrance {{was released}} on July 18, 2012, and shows Beyoncé wearing a purple mini-dress. Idolator's writer X. Alexander wrote that she looked [...] "appropriately regal in purple in her new fragrance art" [...] while Julee Wilson of The Huffington Post wrote that the advertisement [...] "definitely screams sensual". Gaby Wilson of MTV commented that the photo appropriately sets the mood for the midnight perfume further praising Beyoncé's look. Ambika Mutto of VH1 gave a negative review for the poster, writing that she was [...] "really disappointed" [...] because the image was [...] "boring and literal". She noted, [...] "Sexy hair flying, sexy dress in a color reminiscent of midnight, on a rooftop against the midnight sky — we get it." [...] A writer of the website Digital Spy praised the scent, writing that it empowers [...] "your inner diva" [...] and added that [...] "there will be no Single Ladies left <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> this". At the 2013 StyleBistro Awards, Midnight Heat was nominated in the category for Best New Fragrance.|$|E
2500|$|Unless you are {{allergic}} to the pollen of certain trees and herbs (such as birch, horse chestnut, alder, lilac, cherry tree, ash tree, rowan tree, lime tree, dandelion), {{the best time}} for travelling to central European Russia is late spring when the temperatures are pleasant and many trees are in bloom, and early and mid autumn when trees change their colour and it is not cold yet. Summer months are also good except for June in cities in central and south Russia when poplar fluff can be a nuisance, but recently the authorities of many Russian cities have taken action against the fluff by cutting and removing poplar trees and the situation has improved dramatically. Late autumn, winter months, and early spring will be enjoyable <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> appropriate clothes and shoes. If you are interested in winter activities, in central European Russia it usually begins to snow in late autumn and snowpack usually doesn't melt away completely before early April, although spells of warm weather do occur and snow can temporarily melt away in mid-winter. Ski resorts in mountainous areas have snow throughout the winter season. Central European Russia sometimes experiences cold spells in early May when the temperature can go from +15°C/59°F to the freezing point for a few days.|$|E

It always is in good taste. It goes well with almost everything. It is neat and it is useful. If there is need of getting out of sight in a hurry you can do it <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> brown. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> bright colors it isn't so easy. I never envy anybody who happens to have brighter clothes than mine.

60|$|Here or {{anywhere}} you must scour your head {{every two or}} three days or it is full of grit. Your clothes must collect just as much dirt as your hair. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> white clothes you are clean, and your cleaning bill gets so heavy that you have to take care. I am proud to say that I can wear a white suit of clothes without a blemish for three days. If you need any further instruction in the matter of clothes I shall be glad to give it to you. I hope I have convinced some of you that it is just as well to wear white clothes as any other kind. I do not want to boast. I only want to make you understand that you are not clean.|$|E
6000|$|The Duke bowed deeply, but {{coloured}} with resentment, {{and took}} an immediate opportunity {{to place the}} weapon carelessly against a pile of arms. The King did not observe a contemptuous motion, which, perhaps, would not have pleased him, being at the moment occupied with the veteran, whom he exhorted to lean upon him, as he conveyed him to a seat, permitting no other person to assist him. [...] "Rest there," [...] he said, [...] "my brave old friend; and Charles Stewart must be poor indeed, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>wear</b> that dress an hour longer.--You look very pale, my good Coleby, to have had so much colour a few minutes since. Be not vexed at what Buckingham says; no one minds his folly.--You look worse and worse. Come, come, you are too much hurried by this meeting. Sit still--do not rise--do not attempt to kneel. I command you to repose yourself till I have made the round of these apartments." ...|$|E

60|$|Again, {{the enemies}} of grey (those astute, daring and evil-minded men) are fond of {{bringing}} forward the argument that colours suffer in grey weather, and that strong sunlight is necessary to all the hues of heaven and earth. Here again there are two words to be said; and {{it is essential to}} distinguish. It is true that sun is needed to burnish and bring into bloom the tertiary and dubious colours; the colour of peat, pea-soup, Impressionist sketches, brown velvet coats, olives, grey and blue slates, the complexions of vegetarians, the tints of volcanic rock, chocolate, cocoa, mud, soot, slime, old boots; the delicate shades of these do need the sunlight to bring out the faint beauty that often clings to them. But if you have a healthy negro taste in colour, if you choke your garden with poppies and geraniums, if you paint your house sky-blue and scarlet, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>wear,</b> let us say, a golden top-hat and a crimson frock-coat, you will not only be visible on the greyest day, but you will notice that your costume and environment produce a certain singular effect. You will find, I mean, that rich colours actually look more luminous on a grey day, because they are seen against a sombre background and seem to be burning with a lustre of their own. Against a dark sky all flowers look like fireworks. There is something strange about them, at once vivid and secret, like flowers traced in fire in the phantasmal garden of a witch. A bright blue sky is necessarily the high light of the picture; and its brightness kills all the bright blue flowers. But on a grey day the larkspur looks like fallen heaven; the red daisies are really the red lost eyes of day; and the sunflower is the vice-regent of the sun.|$|E

50|$|Many other {{familiar}} objects {{exhibit the}} same chiral symmetry {{of the human}} body, such as gloves and shoes.
