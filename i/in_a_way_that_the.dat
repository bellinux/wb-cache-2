5|$|The {{large amount}} of space in rural cemeteries permits the use of {{sculpture}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> crowded churchyard has never allowed. Many rural cemeteries, including Oakwood, subsequently became virtual outdoor sculpture museums, displaying the works of well-known contemporary sculptors as memorials to the deceased. Oakwood is home to thousands of individual statues and sculptures as well as 24 private mausolea. Because of its popularity as a public park, many memorials included benches to invite visitors to rest while investigating the large, hilly property.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to retelling the plot from Metroid, Metroid: Zero Mission introduces new cinematics {{to push the}} story forward. Sakamoto believed {{in the importance of}} having a story to complement a game. He found it particularly difficult to convey the game's plot accurately <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> player can understand, because of the sparse use of dialogue in the Metroid series. The story for Metroid: Zero Mission was rewritten to explore Samus Aran's backstory more than in the original Metroid. Cinematics are used to show Samus' memories to move the story forward and to keep the plot open for interpretation. Sakamoto claimed that this was intended to expand the original story while retaining some mystery. The game is the first Metroid game to let the player choose a difficulty level {{at the start of the}} game; each of three levels varies in the amount of damage caused by enemies. The battle with Mother Brain marked the end of the original Metroid; however, Metroid: Zero Mission offers players extra levels to play after the battle.|$|E
5|$|Made on {{a budget}} of 180 million {{including}} production, prints and advertising, and marketing, Mary Kom earned 200 million, and before release recouped more than its cost from brand tie-ups. The film made profits before the release. Partnership was arranged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> products from brands were either showcased in the film or the brands promoted the film in their advertising. The satellite rights of the film were sold for 140 million and music rights for 30 million. The film was released in DVDs on 15 October 2014 across all regions in a one-disc pack in NTSC format. Distributed by Shemaroo Entertainment, it contained behind-the-scene footage and deleted scenes. The VCD and Blu-ray versions were released at the same time. The Mary Kom Blu-ray is the first Blu-ray title in India to feature a Dolby Atmos soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|The {{conquest of}} the Danelaw by West Saxon kings had united England in a single kingdom for the first time, {{enabling}} kings from Æthelstan onwards {{to see themselves as}} heirs of the Carolingian emperors; the regulation of monasteries by a uniform Benedictine rule was designed to unite the kingdom ideologically and enhance royal prestige. The monks depended on the king <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> local ealdormen did not, so their loyalty could be trusted and they could act as a counterbalance to powerful local families. The Regularis Concordia required that psalms be said for the king and the queen in monasteries several times a day, and specified that royal consent must be obtained for the election of abbots. The reformers aimed to enhance the Christian character of kingship, and one aspect of this was to raise the status of the queen; Edgar's last wife, Ælfthryth, was the first king's consort to regularly witness charters as regina.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, justice in Scotland was {{a mixture of}} the royal and local, which was often unsystematic with {{overlapping}} jurisdictions, undertaken by clerical lawyers, laymen, amateurs and local leaders. Under James IV the legal functions of the council were rationalised, with a royal Court of Session meeting daily in Edinburgh to deal with civil cases. In 1514 the office of justice-general was created for the earl of Argyll (and held by his family until 1628). The study of law was popular in Scotland from the Middle Ages and many students travelled to Continental Europe to study canon law and civil law. In 1532 the Royal College of Justice was founded, leading to the training and professionalisation of an emerging group of career lawyers. The Court of Session placed increasing emphasis on its independence from influence, including from the king, and superior jurisdiction over local justice. Its judges were increasingly able to control entry to their own ranks. In 1605 the professionalisation of the bench led to entry requirements in Latin, law and a property qualification of £2,000, designed to limit the danger of bribery, helping to create an exclusive, wealthy and powerful and professional caste, who also now dominated government posts <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> clergy had done in the Middle Ages. In 1672 the High Court of Justiciary was founded from the College of Justice as a supreme court of appeal. The Act of Union in 1707 largely persevered the distinct Scottish legal system and its courts, separate from English jurisdiction.|$|E

25|$|The {{opposition}} to and {{defeat of the}} agrarian law sponsored by Pompey {{was more than just}} {{opposition to}} Pompey. Nor was the law exclusively about allotting land for the settlement of Pompey's veterans. Pompey did want to allocate plots of land to his veterans. Soldiers had been expecting to be allocated land to farm after having fought in a war since Sulla had granted his soldiers land in 80 BC. Pompey wanted to fulfill this obligation. However, the law was framed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> land would be distributed to the landless urban poor as well. This would help to relieve the problem of the mass of the landless unemployed or underemployed poor in Rome, which relied on the provision of a grain dole by the state to survive. It would also make Pompey popular among the plebeians. Populares politicians had been proposing this kind land reform since the introduction of the agrarian law of Tiberius Gracchus in 133 BC. These were always strongly opposed by the optimates. This issue had led to the murder of Tiberius Gracchus. Attempts to introduce such agrarian laws since then were defeated by the optimates. Thus, the opposition to the bill sponsored by Pompey came within this wider historical context of optimate resistance to reform as well as the optimates being suspicious of Pompey. A crucial element in the defeat of the bill sponsored by Pompey was the fact what the optimates had a strong consul in Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer who vehemently and successfully resisted its enactment, while the consul sponsored by Pompey, Lucius Afrianius was ineffective. He was of no assistance. The lack of effective consular assistance had been a weakness for Pompey. As already mentioned above, Plutarch wrote that the defeat of the bill forced Pompey to seek the support of plebeian tribunes, and thus of the populares. With the return of Caesar from his governorship in Hispania, Pompey found politician who would have the strength and clout to push the bill through if he became a consul.|$|E
