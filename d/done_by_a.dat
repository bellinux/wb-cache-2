5|$|Most of {{the works}} {{that make up the}} Better Out Than In series were defaced, some just hours after the piece was unveiled. At least one {{defacement}} was identified as <b>done</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> competing artist, OMAR NYC, who spray-painted over Banksy's red mylar balloon piece in Red Hook. OMAR NYC also defaced some of Banksy's work in May 2010.|$|E

5|$|Other {{businessmen}} reaped great rewards in retail, shipping, entertainment, lodging, or transportation. Boardinghouses, food preparation, sewing, {{and laundry}} were highly profitable businesses often run by women (married, single, or widowed) who realized men would pay {{well for a}} service <b>done</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> woman. Brothels also brought in large profits, especially when combined with saloons and gaming houses.|$|E
5|$|The parish {{continued}} largely if {{not wholly}} a sinecure for its rector, {{with the work}} actually <b>done</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> resident vicar; in Bradwardine's case he was concurrently prebend and the dean of Lincoln, and chaplain and confessor to the King, and probably never visited Llanbadarn Fawr.|$|E
5|$|A {{disappointed}} Oliphant {{flew to the}} United States {{to speak}} to the American scientists. These included Ernest Lawrence at the University of California's Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. The two men had met before the war, and were friends. Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium. Uranium-235 makes up only about 0.72% of natural uranium, so the separation factor of any uranium enrichment process needs to be higher than 1250 to produce 90% uranium-235 from natural uranium. The Maud Committee had recommended that this be <b>done</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> process of gaseous diffusion, but Oliphant had pioneered another technique in 1934: electromagnetic separation. This was the process that Nier had used.|$|E

5|$|At Kanshi Ram's funeral ceremonies in 2006, Mayawati {{stated that}} both Kanshi Ram and herself had been, {{and she would}} {{continue}} to be, observant of Buddhist traditions and customs. She has stated her intention to formally convert to Buddhism when the political conditions enable her to become Prime Minister of India. Her act of performing the last rites (traditionally <b>done</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> male heir) was an expression of their views against gender discrimination. When she was Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, she publicly called Bhikkhus to prayer.|$|E
5|$|Further {{purification}} is <b>done</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{chemical transport}} reaction developed by Anton Eduard van Arkel and Jan Hendrik de Boer. In a closed vessel, the metal reacts with iodine at temperatures above 500°C forming metal(IV) iodide; at a tungsten filament of nearly 2000°C the reverse reaction happens and the iodine and metal are set free. The metal forms a solid coating on the tungsten filament and the iodine can react with additional metal {{resulting in a}} steady turnover.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, {{the hunting}} is <b>done</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> {{select group of}} fishermen. When a pod of {{dolphins}} has been spotted, they're driven into a bay by the fishermen while banging on metal rods in the water to scare and confuse the dolphins. When the dolphins are in the bay, it is quickly closed off with nets so the dolphins cannot escape. The dolphins are usually not caught and killed immediately, but instead left to calm down over night. The following day, the dolphins are caught {{one by one and}} killed.|$|E

5|$|Lek breeding, where males congregate {{to display}} to females, has been {{recorded}} {{in at least one}} species Cyrtocara eucinostomus. Lek-like breeding systems have also been recorded in several other species. In monogamous species, males and females may form pair bonds and breed exclusively with their partners. This occurs in North American freshwater catfishes, many butterflyfishes, sea horses and several other species. Courtship in teleosts plays a role in species recognition, strengthening pair bonds, spawning site position and gamete release synchronisation. This includes colour changes, sound production and visual displays (fin erection, rapid swimming, breaching), which is often done by the male. Courtship may be <b>done</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> female to overcome a territorial male that would otherwise drive her away.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{underwater}} scenes, especially involving close-ups of Bond and Melina, were actually faked on a dry soundstage. A combination of lighting effects, slow-motion photography, wind, and bubbles added in post-production, gave {{the illusion of}} the actors being underwater. Actress Carole Bouquet reportedly had a pre-existing health condition that prevented her from performing actual underwater stunt work. Actual aquatic scenes were <b>done</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> team led by Al Giddings, who had previously worked on The Deep, and filmed in either Pinewood's tank on the 007 Stage or an underwater set built in the Bahamas. Production designer Peter Lamont and his team developed two working props for the submarine Neptune, {{as well as a}} mock-up with a fake bottom.|$|E
5|$|Separation of {{trivalent}} actinides from lanthanide {{fission products}} can be <b>done</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> cation-exchange resin column using a 90% water/10% ethanol solution saturated with hydrochloric acid (HCl) as eluant. It is usually followed by anion-exchange chromatography using 6 molar HCl as eluant. A cation-exchange resin column (Dowex-50 exchange column) treated with ammonium salts is {{then used to}} separate fractions containing elements 99, 100 and 101. These elements can be then identified simply based on their elution position/time, using α-hydroxyisobutyrate solution (α-HIB), for example, as eluant.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{medium for}} {{professional}} Dota 2 coverage {{is through the}} video game live streaming platform, Twitch.tv. For most major events, tournament coverage is <b>done</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> selection of dedicated eSports organizations and personnel who provide on-site commentary, analysis, match predictions, and player interviews surrounding the event in progress, similar to traditional sporting events. Live Dota 2 games and coverage have also been simulcast on television networks around the world, such as ESPN in the United States, Sport1 in Germany, TV 2 Zulu in Denmark, Xinwen Lianbo in China, Astro in Malaysia, and TV5 in the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|The {{show was}} {{primarily}} filmed using Sony DSR-570 cameras, although special equipment {{was needed for}} some unique footage. For scenes inside the animals' burrows, mini fibre-optic infra-red cameras were employed; wide-angle shots were filmed with a seven-metre crane and a remote-controlled camera platform. An off-camera wireless microphone was also used to record many meerkat vocalizations, only partially audible to cameras' on-board systems. Most filming was <b>done</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> single cameraman and a single sound engineer; researchers have required a minimal human presence to avoid stressing the animals. Eye-level shots were difficult to achieve at times, due to the meerkats' small size and the limited height of even the smallest tripods.|$|E
5|$|The {{temple was}} reconstructed {{on the basis}} of several {{elements}} (about 4,000) of the temple which were randomly lying around at the site. This restoration was <b>done</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> Chinese team between 2000 and 2009 under a restoration project sponsored by the People's Republic of China. Originally this temple was partly built in the mid-12th century under the reign of King Suryavarman II. Further supplementation of structures was done under the reign of Jayavarman VII. Though the temple was built under Hindu kings during the 11th and 12th centuries with predominantly Hindu deities such as Shiva and Vishnu, representation of Buddha images was interpreted to have been built during the reign of Dharanindravarman, father of Jayavarman VII, who ruled from Preah Khan Kompong Svay.|$|E

5|$|The {{work was}} carried out in an empty room of Okada's house where their {{business}} was also operated. While other people were present, the work was shared and Anno, Akai and Yamaga worked full-time on the production, the direction was not professional, but Takeada attributed Okada as the producer, with Yamaga directing, Akai doing character animation and Anno as the mecha animator. Takeada also said other individuals were involved and were used to trace cels or paint cels as needed, but still credits Yamaga, Akai and Anno with the production itself. Filming was <b>done</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> camera on a tripod and frames were called out by Anno because the production lacked timing sheets.|$|E
5|$|Dota 2 has a {{widespread}} and active competitive scene, with teams {{from across the}} world playing professionally in various leagues and tournaments. Premium Dota 2 tournaments often have prize pools totaling millions of U.S. dollars, the highest of any eSport. The largest of them is known as The International, which is produced annually by Valve and held at the KeyArena in Seattle. Valve also manages an event format known as the Dota Pro Circuit, which {{are a series of}} tournaments held every year that award qualification points based on results for getting directly invited to The International. For most tournaments, media coverage is <b>done</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> selection of on-site staff who provide commentary and analysis for the ongoing matches, similar to traditional sporting events. Broadcasts of professional Dota 2 matches are streamed live over the internet, and sometimes simulcast on television networks, with peak viewership numbers in the millions.|$|E
5|$|Myles' Mary Collins {{prosthetic}} {{took six}} hours to accomplish, and the shot where she morphs into the younger Lady Helen took seven hours to complete because it required three stages of make-up. Her first {{performance at the}} beheading scene was met with applause by the extras; Head requested that he redo {{his part of the}} scene because he felt that it was not good enough. Gaius' fall from the balcony was <b>done</b> <b>by</b> <b>a</b> stuntman and filmed with a high-speed camera. The mattress that Merlin magically moves across the floor was achieved with rigging it up to hidden wires and pulleys under the set. The knives Arthur throws were actually shot out of a nitrogen gun; James did throw them in a separate shot, but against a cloth that he still missed. Fake fruit was made for the stocks scene, but it was deemed too fake-looking and was replaced with real tomatoes. The mace fight was originally filmed with plastic maces, but they were not believable as they did not have enough weight. The scene was then shot with real steel maces; {{it was one of the}} most complex and hardest scenes to execute. The climax, where the guests all fall asleep and are covered by cobwebs, took many days to complete. The chandelier falling was also considered difficult.|$|E
