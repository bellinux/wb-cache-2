40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} Echo, a novel yet practical {{approach to the}} formal verification of implementations. <b>Echo</b> <b>splits</b> verification into two major parts. The first part verifies an implementation against a low-level specification. The second uses a technique called reverse synthesis to extract a high-level specification from the low-level specification. The extracted specification is proved to imply the original system specification. Much of Echo is automated, and it reduces the verification burden by distributing it over separate tools and techniques. Reverse synthesis is achieved largely by mechanically applying a variety of semantics-preserving transformations, including complexity-reducing transformations, which {{can be viewed as}} optimizing the program for verification rather than for size or speed. We give a detailed example of Echo, verifying an implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) against the official specification of AES...|$|R
50|$|A belated <b>echo</b> of the <b>split</b> was the {{division}} among French socialists {{in the late}} 1930s over what attitude to take if Hitler invaded Poland. Most French socialists were firmly anti-fascist; though none contemplated the prospect of another war with Germany with joy, {{they were prepared to}} take that step if Germany attacked Poland. A minority, however, wanted to maintain peace at any cost. Some were motivated by unconditional pacifism, others by fascist sympathies which subsequently manifested themselves, {{as in the case of}} the ex-socialist and future premier of the Vichy régime, Pierre Laval.|$|R
50|$|The {{first story}} is built of dressed, {{randomly}} coursed stone. It {{gives way to}} frame and a gambrel roof on the upper stories. A projecting, center-shingled pavilion on the west facade is trimmed in half-timber, coming to a louvered gable peak with its rafters intentionally exposed as decoration. A similarly decorated porch, with open gable, extends from the pavilion. The south profile has a one-story projecting bay supporting a balcony. The windows and doors on the first story have arched openings, <b>echoed</b> by a <b>split</b> rounded transom over the double-doored main entrance.|$|R

50|$|The visiting British Quakers {{exacerbated}} {{the differences among}} American Quakers, differences that <b>echoed</b> the 1819 <b>split</b> between the Unitarians and Congregationalists. The influence of Anna Braithwaite was especially strong. She visited the United States three times between 1823 and 1827 and published her Letters and observations relating to the controversy respecting the doctrines of Elias Hicks in 1824 Hicks felt obliged to respond {{and in the same}} year published a letter to his ally in the Philadelphia Meeting, Dr. Edwin Atlee, in The Misrepresentations of Anna Braithwaite. This in turn was replied to by Braithwaite in A Letter from Anna Braithwaite to Elias Hicks, On the Nature of his Doctrines in 1825.|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper was initiated by recent efforts to use circumferential creeping waves for ultrasonic nondestructive testing of inaccessible airframe structures for fatigue cracking. One particular such application of great interest in the aerospace industry is the inspection of weep holes drilled through vertical stiffeners in wet-wing structures (used as fuel tanks) of both military and civilian aircraft in order to permit remnant fuel to be evenly distributed during flight. Unfortunately, they can become the sites from which fatigue cracks often originate. A new split-aperture technique was recently suggested for the inspection of these holes [1]. The outstanding sensitivity of the split-aperture circumferential creeping wave technique in dry weep holes was well demonstrated on both simulated and real fatigue cracks. However, the presence of fuel or even its residues in the weep hole significantly affects the behavior of the circumferential creeping wave. It causes the creeping wave <b>echo</b> to <b>split</b> into a rather weak Rayleigh-type surface wave signal and a much stronger but somewhat slower halo signal [2]. In order to adapt the circumferential creeping wave inspection technique to the case of fluid-filled cavities {{it is important to understand}} the adverse effects of fluid loading on the Rayleigh- type circumferential surface wave, which is the only mode sensitive to such cracks...|$|R

40|$|On {{the basis}} of a tight-binding model for a {{strongly}} disordered semiconductor with correlated conduction- and valence band disorder a new coherent dynamical intra-band effect is analyzed. For systems that are excited by two, specially designed ultrashort light-pulse sequences delayed by tau relatively to each other echo-like phenomena are predicted to occur. In addition to the inter-band photon echo which shows up at exactly t= 2 *tau relative to the first pulse, the system responds with two spontaneous intra-band current pulses preceding and following the appearance of the photon <b>echo.</b> The temporal <b>splitting</b> depends on the electron-hole mass ratio. Calculating the population relaxation rate due to Coulomb scattering, it is concluded that the predicted new dynamical effect should be experimentally observable in an interacting and strongly disordered system, such as the Quantum-Coulomb-Glass.

40|$|Radar {{observations}} {{have been}} analyzed to determine characteristics of convection over the oceanic region around Kwajalein {{in the tropical}} western Pacific. Generally, the echo areas, heights, and durations exhibited lognormal distributions. Heights were greater under conditions of higher midtropospheric hu-midity and correlated with echo area, with {{a wide spread of}} values. Mergers and <b>splits</b> often truncated <b>echo</b> lifetimes. The most surprising result was the distribution of orientation angles of echo lines, which statistically verify the shear-parallel and shear-normal modes of convective line organization seen elsewhere over tropical oceans. The two modes typically coexisted within the area of radar coverage, indicating a potential difficulty in predicting line orientation in terms of large-scale variables. The largest members of the echo population were mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), which had large stratiform components. They occurred in environments of increased humidity and higher midlevel buoyancy associated with westward-propagating synoptic-scale disturbances. MCSs moved with the easterlies in low to midlevels and exhibited the jump updraft, overturning updraft, and subsiding midlevel inflow charac-teristic of tropical oceanic MCSs. The Kwajalein Experiment (KWAJEX) radar echo population resembles that of the eastern tropical Atlantic in terms of the shapes of the distributions of area, height, and lifetime, the prevalence of <b>echo</b> mergers and <b>splits,</b> and the tendency to form shear-parallel and shear-normal lines. These characteristics appear to be endemic to oceanic convective populations. Large-scale conditions appear to modulate these basic population characteristics rather than qualitatively alter them. 1...|$|R

Pere Magdića (1863. – 1922.), odvjetnika i političara pravaške orijentacije, u razdoblju nastanka i razvoja “modernoga pravaštva” u Varaždinu, njegova usmjerenja prema politici “novoga kursa” i stvaranju Hrvatsko-srpske koalicije. Ujedno je rad prikaz društveno-političkih prilika u sjeverozapadnoj Hrvatskoj u jeku previranja na prijelazu iz XIX. u XX. stoljeće. This paper {{analyses}} {{the life}} and work of Dr Pero Magdić (1863 – 1922), a lawyer and politician who accepted the Party of Right’s ideology {{at the time when}} “Modern Rightism” was being created and developed in Varaždin, as well as his support for the “New Course” policy and the creation of the Croat- Serb Coalition. In addition, this work presents the socio-political situation in northwest Croatia on the turn of the 20 th century. The first part of the text describes the social conditions of the rise of Rightism in Varaždin in the mid- 1880 s {{as a result of the}} discontent of the citizens of Varaždin with the slow modernisation of their region, which made it a peripheral part of the national and Central European space. The second part examines the effects of Khuen’s growing autocracy on the ranks of his opposition, the <b>echoes</b> of the <b>split</b> in the Party of Right in Varaždin, and the reasons for Magdić’s alignment with Folnegović’s faction. The third part analyses the beginnings of the renewed affirmation of the opposition in Varaždin (1898 – 1905), in which Magdić played a key part. The events in Varaždin in 1903 confirmed him as one of the leaders of the opposition (but not the Pure Party of Right). His support for the Rijeka Resolution and the “New Course” policy allowed him to become a member of the Croatian Parliament on the list of the Croat-Serb Coalition in 1906 and to hold various important political offices, e. g. that of Deputy Speaker of the Croatian Parliament (two mandates; 1908 – 1910 and 1913 – 1918), Croatian representative at the Hungarian-Croatian Parliament in Budapest, and Mayor of Varaždin (1910, 1914 – 1918) ...|$|R
5000|$|A story, {{taken from}} the oral traditions of Abruzzo, {{concerning}} the region's religious conversion from Paganism to Christianity possibly records the impact event in the 5th century AD. It was in the afternoon...an uproar hit the mountain and quartered the giant oaks announcing the violent arrival of the Goddess. A sudden and intense heat overwhelmed the people and a shout <b>echoed</b> all around, <b>splitting</b> the air with its trail of violence ... All of a sudden, over there, in the distance, in the sky, a new star, never seen before, bigger than the other ones, came nearer and nearer, appeared and disappeared behind {{the top of the}} eastern mountains. Peoples’ eyes looked at the strange light growing bigger and bigger. Soon the star shone as large as a new sun. An irresistible, dazzling light pervaded the sky. The oak leaves shuddered, discoloured, and curled up. The forest lost its sap.The Sirente was shaking. In a tremendous rumble the statue sank into a sudden chasm. The satyrs and the Bacchantes fell down senseless. A huge silence fell. It seemed as if time had stopped in the ancient wood near the temple {{at the foot of the}} Sirente, and it looked like the mountain had never existed. The entire valley became dumb. Not a breath of wind could be heard, nor a sheep bleating from the numerous herds, nor a rustle from the strong trees, nor a human sound. After an endless period of time, when stars shone in the sky without the moon, a new breeze came to stir the leaves; sheep were heard again and the Mountain was dressed in the light of a new dawn.Faint stars disappeared, blue sky slowly came back and the Sirente became a golden mountain in the first rays of the new sun. It looked like the Valley was full of roses. Newly awake, men listened closely to the death rattle of the Goddess at the foot of the wood; and then they saw the statue of the Madonna with the Holy Child in her arms who was sitting on a throne of light and was surrounded by light.|$|R
40|$|Several thinkers {{among the}} Slavs {{and in the}} Orthodox East have been led by the vision of Sophia – {{integral}} wisdom. Sophiology {{is an effort to}} integrate different sources of knowledge: revelation, reason and sensory experience. Its intention is to overcome the split among the psychic components of the human personality, which is <b>echoed</b> in the <b>split</b> among social processes and institutions. Such effort is of importance for the education of independent and morally responsible (wo) men and for the renewal of society’s weakened fundamental values. Sophiology’s basic intuition is the unity of creation; nature and society are shaped by the same beings or principles that are manifested and also operate within the human soul. Thanks to this, one can understand the external world by drawing on one’s inner experience and vice versa, and give meaning to things by means of all-pervading analogies. This epistemological presupposition has been all but abandoned recently as a relic of a romantic or even older medieval way of thinking. In Slovakia, this has been reflected in the argument within the Štúrovci group concerning the principle of spiritual vision, which played a vital role in its Slavonic science project. We shall demonstrate that knowledge of this kind is still possible. It is possible, for example, to understand and effectively predict cultural epochs in history from the sequence and contents of psychic configurations during the biographical development of an individual. Introspective observation of archetypes sheds light on the evolution of new species, which appear to be a somatization of these archetypes. Architecture can be derived from the shapes of the human body, specifically those organs associated with the qualities of the soul that prevail in a given historical period. The inwardly perceived effects of some metals correspond to their outward qualities. Therefore, developmental psychology and history, history and paleontology, architecture and anatomy, psychology and chemistry can be at least partly integrated. The metaphysical basis of these connections and thus also the limits of the applicability of this approach are still controversial. It does provide, however, a number of advantages from a pedagogical point of view. Awareness of the links between nature, history and the intimate processes of the human psyche restores lost meaning to things, consolidates the consciousness of objective values and encourages responsibility by following the causation of things into the free core of the human personality. Synthetic knowledge also correlates significantly with creativity and independent judgment. By embedding knowledge in interconnections and ridding it of emotional neutrality it works in accordance with the natural functioning of memory and relieves it of the tiresome cramming of knowledge...|$|R
