40|$|The {{abrasive}} wear of unfilled and fiber-filled elastomers was studied both with experiments and with finite element simulations. Wear experiments with <b>elastomer</b> <b>seals</b> exhibited two distinct regimes: an initial, "break-in" period {{followed by an}} "aggressive wear" period. During the break-in period, few abrasive particles are able to penetrate the seal's contact band, and no substantial seal wear occurs. During the aggressive wear period, abrasive particles aggregate into distinct clusters which advance at a linear rate and abrasively wear the seal. Filled <b>elastomer</b> <b>seals</b> were shown to have break-in periods significantly longer than those of unfilled <b>elastomer</b> <b>seals.</b> The aggressive wear rates and mechanisms of filled and unfilled <b>elastomer</b> <b>seals</b> were determined to be virtually identical.

Modeling of fiber-filled elastomers indicated that fibers should have no effect on the aggressive wear process. Additional modeling of fiber-filled elastomers suggested several mechanisms by which the fibers might extend the break-in period of the seal. Seal wear experiments with well-defined slurries offered strong evidence that the fibers extend the break-in period of the seal by inhibiting particle ingestion and cluster formation.

40|$|To {{successfully}} mate two pressurized vehicles or {{structures in}} space, advanced seals are required at the interface {{to prevent the}} loss of breathable air to the vacuum of space. A critical part of the development testing of candidate seal designs was a verification of {{the integrity of the}} retaining mechanism that holds the silicone seal component to the structure. Failure to retain the <b>elastomer</b> <b>seal</b> during flight could liberate seal material in the event of high adhesive loads during undocking. This work presents an investigation of the force required to separate the elastomer from its metal counter-face surface during simulated undocking as well as a comparison to that force which was necessary to destructively remove the elastomer from its retaining device. Two silicone elastomers, Wacker 007 - 49524 and Esterline ELASA- 401, were evaluated. During the course of the investigation, modifications were made to the retaining devices to determine if the modifications improved the force needed to destructively remove the seal. The tests were completed at the expected operating temperatures of - 50, + 23, and + 75 C.

40|$|<b>Elastomer</b> <b>seals</b> {{are widely}} used in {{industry}} for containing gases and liquids. Seal failure can have significant environmental and financial implications far beyond {{the cost of the}} seal itself. Explosive decompression failure can cause catastrophic cracking of an elastomer seal, causing leakage. The objective of this research was to develop a modelling methodology to predict the onset of crack damage in <b>elastomer</b> <b>seals</b> under various operational conditions. The modelling methodology uses the finite element method to determine the performance of various elastomers under decompression conditions. The model takes into account seal and groove geometry, the non-linear behaviour of the material and the operational conditions seen by the seal. The model predicts crack initiations, locations and the orientation of the propagation. The model can also calculate the safe decompression time - required for no damage in the elastomer seal by using the methodology in reverse. To carry out the modelling methodology, certain input data are required. The data was determined by designing and constructing specialist test rigs. A permeation testing facility was developed to determine the diffusion, solubility and permeation characteristics of elastomers subject to gas pressure. The physical behaviour of the elastomers was determined through extensive uniaxial and equibiaxial tensile testing. The nature of the failure initiation points is determined by microscopic analysis of seal sections. Decompression tests were performed to validate the output of the model. Comparison of the model outputs with the decompression tests show a good correlation between the prediction and the occurrences, orientations and positions of cracks. The ability to predict damage in a quantitative manner was previously not available. The methodology will be developed into a knowledge-based software tool for use in industry to predict damage and develop new materials to resist explosive decompression...|$|E

Though swell packers can significantly reduce costs and increase productivity, their failure can lead to serious losses. The integrity and reliability of swelling <b>elastomer</b> <b>seals</b> under different field conditions is a major concern. The investigation of changes in material behavior over a specified swelling period is a necessary first step for performance evaluation of <b>elastomer</b> <b>seals.</b> The current study is based on experimental analysis of changes in geometric and mechanical behavior (hardness, tensile, compressive, bulk) of an elastomeric material due to swelling.

LIDS is being developed to enable the CEV to dock to the ISS (International Space Station) or to Altair (NASA's next lunar lander). The silicone seal on LIDS seals against aluminum alloy flanges on ISS or Altair. Since the integrity of a seal depends on both sealing surfaces, aluminum targets were also impacted. The variables considered in this study included projectile mass, density, speed, incidence angle, seal materials, and target surface treatments and coatings. Most of the impacts used a velocity near 8 km/s and spherical aluminum projectiles (density = 2. 7 g/cubic centimeter), however, a few tests were done near 5. 6 km/s. Tests were also performed using projectile densities of 7. 7, 2. 79, 2. 5 or 1. 14 g/cubic centimeter. Projectile incidence angles examined included 0 degrees, 45 degrees, and 60 degrees from normal to the plane of the target.

The process of horizontal tubular expansion is similar to the vertical expansion of expandable tubular in down-hole environment with the addition of uniformly distributed force due to its weight.

40|$|Seals {{are used}} to {{facilitate}} the joining of two items, usually temporarily. At {{some point in the}} future, it is expected that the items will need to be separated. This innovation enables control of the adhesive properties of silicone-based elastomers. The innovation may also be effective on elastomers other than the silicone-based ones. A technique has been discovered that decreases the level of adhesion of silicone- based elastomers to negligible levels. The new technique causes less damage to the material compared to alternative adhesion mitigation techniques. Silicone-based elastomers are the only class of rubber-like materials that currently meet NASA s needs for various seal applications. However, silicone-based elastomers have natural inherent adhesive properties. This stickiness can be helpful, but it can frequently cause problems as well, such as when trying to get items apart.
