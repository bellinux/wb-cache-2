500|$|Carte {{later said}} it was [...] "the scheme of my life" [...] to found a school of high-quality, family-friendly English comic opera, in {{contrast}} to the [...] burlesques and adaptations of French operettas that dominated the London musical stage at that time. His experience in writing operettas, however, had convinced him that his own creative talents were inadequate for the task. He later wrote to dramatist W. S. Gilbert, [...] "I envy your position but I could never attain it. If I could be an author like you <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> not be a manager. I am simply the tradesman who sells your works of art." [...] Furthermore, in 1874 Carte did not yet have the resources to make his idea into reality, and after his season at the Opera Comique, he terminated his lease. In the same year, he arranged for his client, Offenbach, to collaborate with H. B. Farnie to write a new operetta on the theme of Dick Whittington and His Cat, which played during the Christmas season at the Alhambra Theatre.|$|E
2500|$|No doubt, I am {{indebted to}} Abu Bakr {{more than to}} anybody else {{regarding}} both his companionship and his wealth. And if I {{had to take a}} Khalil from my followers, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> have taken Abu Bakr, but the fraternity of Islam is sufficient. Let no Door of the Mosque remain open, except the door of Abu Bakr ...|$|E
5000|$|Abu Sufyaan {{thought to}} himself, [...] "By Allaah! <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>certainly</b> lied had I not feared {{being called a}} liar." ...|$|R
5000|$|After his {{election}} to the presidency, Bachir Gemayel said: “If I had to deliver a Resistance medal of honour, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>certainly</b> given it to the greatest fighter of our Resistance, Fouad Abou Nader.” ...|$|R
50|$|Anas {{reported}} Mohammed as saying: If {{you were}} not (to abandon) the burying of the dead (in the grave), <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>certainly</b> supplicated to Allah that He should make {{you listen to the}} torment of the grave.|$|R
2500|$|... "Autopsy" [...] is a {{magnificent}} book possessing a vibrancy and objectivity that when I first read it I found quite remarkable. It is, without question, the CW [...] "Book of the Decade" [...] and {{were there any}} prospect of my being around to collect <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> place a large wager on whoever is writing this feature in 90 years time confirming it as CW [...] "Book of the Century".|$|E
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> {{never do}} {{anything}} to diminish {{the horror of the}} Nazi Holocaust as I revere and respect the history of my people. [...] I sponsored legislation which created one of the first state Holocaust Commissions in America and actively served as a Commission member for over 20 years. [...] I regret that anyone in the Jewish Community, my Republican colleagues or anyone else was offended by the portrayal of my comments. [...] My comments were not directed toward any group or people but at the false message and, specifically, the method by which it has been delivered.|$|E
2500|$|In 1995, Árpád Pusztai genetically {{modified}} potatoes with the GNA gene, which he discussed {{on a radio}} interview in 1998 and published in the Lancet in 1999. In 1998, {{he said in an}} interview on a World in Action programme that his group had observed damage to the intestines and immune systems of rats fed the {{genetically modified}} potatoes. He also said, [...] "If I had the choice <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> not eat it", and that [...] "I find it's very unfair to use our fellow citizens as guinea pigs." [...] These remarks started the so-called Pusztai affair.|$|E
5000|$|I obeyed. Regardless of what I {{was ordered}} to do, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have obeyed. <b>Certainly,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have obeyed. <b>I</b> obeyed, I obeyed. (Page 198) ...|$|R

2500|$|In March 2005, Santorum {{expressed}} {{misgivings about}} the death penalty in light of wrongly convicted individuals who were sentenced to death. He went on to say, [...] "I agree with the Pope that in the civilized world ... the application of the death penalty should be limited. I would definitely agree with that. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> suggest there probably should be some further limits on what we use it for." [...] In January 2012, Santorum said, [...] "when there is certainty, that's the case that capital punishment can be used", but [...] "if there is not certainty, under the law, it shouldn't be used." ...|$|E
2500|$|State Senator (and former Majority Leader) Gloria Romero, whose 24th State Senate {{district}} overlaps {{the congressional}} district, {{became the first}} politician to express interest in running for the open seat. On December 18, 2008, the day that Solis's selection first became known, Romero said, [...] "I have deep roots, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> give it every consideration. Definitely, I am interested". The same State Senate seat was previously held by Solis. Of the many possible contenders, Romero said, [...] "I can beat them all". [...] However, on January 8, Romero {{decided not to run}} for the seat, opting to try for California State Superintendent of Public Instruction instead.|$|E
2500|$|In an autobiographical {{piece that}} Orwell {{sent to the}} editors of Twentieth Century Authors in 1940, he wrote: [...] "The writers I care about most and never grow tired of are: Shakespeare, Swift, Fielding, Dickens, Charles Reade, Flaubert and, among modern writers, James Joyce, T. S. Eliot and D. H. Lawrence. But I believe the modern writer who has {{influenced}} me most is W. Somerset Maugham, whom I admire immensely for his power of telling a story straightforwardly and without frills." [...] Elsewhere, Orwell strongly praised the works of Jack London, especially his book The Road. Orwell's investigation of poverty in The Road to Wigan Pier strongly resembles that of Jack London's The People of the Abyss, in which the American journalist disguises himself as an out-of-work sailor to investigate {{the lives of the}} poor in London. In his essay [...] "Politics vs. Literature: An Examination of Gulliver's Travels" [...] (1946) Orwell wrote: [...] "If I had to make a list of six books which were to be preserved when all others were destroyed, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> put Gulliver's Travels among them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> {{suggest it}} to Lord De Terrier. I am sure {{the country would}} go along with him; at any rate the Church would." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{felt very}} fiery on my aunt's account; but <b>I</b> said it <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> be better, if Miss Murdstone pleased, {{not to mention}} her. I could not hear her disrespectfully mentioned, I added, without expressing my opinion in a decided tone.|$|R
2500|$|Dan Rather stated, [...] "if I {{knew then}} what I know now — <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{not have gone}} ahead with the story as it was aired, and <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> not have used the {{documents}} in question." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{following}} {{report of}} a South Melbourne v Melbourne game appeared in The Australasian of 14 July 1894: Someone told them (Melbourne) that McKnight, Windley and Waugh were {{the backbone of the}} Southern team and they immediately conceived the idea of telling men off to block these players. [...] Moysey was directed to shadow McKnight, young Wardill had to prevent Windley getting possession ... and Lewis was appointed to control the movements of Waugh. [...] Their instructions were very definite. [...] They were all three told that it did not matter whether they got a kick themselves at all in the match, if they only succeeded in spoiling the play of the three South cracks. [...] Those who were present at the match can say how well these instructions were carried out. [...] There was nothing in the tactics adopted that infringed a solitary rule of the game and the plan was singularly effective, but I own to feeling a shade of doubt concerning the manliness of the whole proceeding. [...] <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> have preferred to see the representatives of the grand old Melbourne win ... purely upon their superior prowess as players.|$|E
60|$|I {{promised that}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> {{let her know}} in case I had such a desire.|$|E

60|$|Jack. That is nonsense. If I marry {{a charming}} girl like Gwendolen, {{and she is}} the only girl I ever saw in my life that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> marry, <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> won't want to know Bunbury.|$|R
6000|$|Then outspoke Mr. Dockwrath, [...] "Under these circumstances, Mr. Mason, if I were you, I should {{withdraw}} from the house at once. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> not have my case blown upon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have a sister, Major Merton; I may {{possibly}} {{give it to}} her--or, should I marry, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> give it to my wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well; {{the life}} of a gentleman farmer is not a bad one; though in his special {{circumstances}} <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> have recommended a profession." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would believe}} it, dear, whether I had courage {{to say it}} or not. If {{strength}} were given, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> acquiesce, and say, `Thy will be done.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As much so as possible," [...] Morris promised. [...] "It won't be much use, but I shall try. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> {{rather have}} you easily than {{have to fight}} for you." ...|$|R
5000|$|AbsolutePunk said, [...] "If more records like The Narrative were written, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> most <b>certainly</b> have a {{different}} approach towards the genre. But I suppose {{the problem is that}} there aren't many bands as creative or talented as this one. The Narrative have without a doubt released the record of the year so far in this genre, and will surely be able to find fans wherever they find listeners." ...|$|R
2500|$|A. P. Singh, a defence {{lawyer in}} the case, was shown saying, “If my {{daughter}} or sister engaged in pre-marital activities and disgraced herself and allowed herself to lose face and character by doing such things, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> most <b>certainly</b> take this sort of sister or daughter to my farmhouse, {{and in front of}} my entire family, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> put petrol on her and set her alight.” [...] Asked later if he stood by those comments, he insisted that he did.|$|R
60|$|Gwendolen. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> {{advise you}} to do so. Mamma {{has a way of}} coming back {{suddenly}} into a room that I have often had to speak to her about.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I wanted sport, Ralph, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> {{set them}} up; {{but as we}} only want pork, we'll let them lie. Besides, we're not sure of killing them; so, fire away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] agreed Frances, {{sitting down}} and {{beginning}} to peel apples. [...] "So there is no use in lamenting, or <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> sit down and cry, I feel so disappointed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Frank, <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>would</b> {{not stand}} that," [...] said the Honourable John. [...] "What, go {{out before the}} county with one untrained horse and a pony; and you the heir to Greshamsbury!" ...|$|R
5000|$|In his African Rifles and Cartridges, John [...] "Pondoro" [...] Taylor {{describes}} the [...]577 Black Powder Express {{as the most}} popular cartridge for shooting tiger in India and {{that many of the}} greatest lion hunters in Africa preferred it to anything else. He further states [...] "If I was concentrating on tiger or man-eating lion to the exclusion of anything else, I shouldn't hesitate: <b>I</b> <b>would</b> almost <b>certainly</b> have a double [...]577 Powder Express built....".|$|R
6000|$|... "If you think, Mr. Jacks," [...] Penelope said, [...] "that I am keeping {{anything}} from you, {{you are very}} much mistaken. Such sympathy as <b>I</b> have <b>would</b> <b>certainly</b> be {{with those who are}} attempting to bring to justice the perpetrator of such unmentionable crimes. What I object to is the unpleasantness of being associated with your inquiries when I am absolutely unable to give you the least help, or to supply you with any information which is not equally attainable to you." ...|$|R
