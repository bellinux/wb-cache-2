40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} {{the finding of}} a rare variant in the sequence of the hypervariable segment (HVS 1) of mitochondrial (mtDNA) extracted from two preserved hairs, authenticated as belonging to the French Emperor Napoléon I (Napoléon Bonaparte). This rare variant is a mutation that changes the base C to T at position 16, 184 (16184 C→T), and it constitutes the only mutation found in this HVS 1 sequence. This mutation is rare, {{because it was not}} found in a reference database (P < 0. 05). In a personal database (M. Pala) comprising 37, 000 different sequences, the 16184 C→T mutation was found in only three samples, thus in this database the mutation frequency was 0. 00008 %. This mutation 16184 C→T was also the only variant found subsequently in the HVS 1 sequences of mtDNAs extracted from Napoléon's mother (Letizia) and from his youngest sister (Caroline), confirming that this mutation is maternally inherited.

40|$|Generation of clonal {{zebrafish}} {{will facilitate}} large-scale genetic screening {{and help us}} to overcome other biological and biotechnological challenges due to their isogenecity. However, protocols {{for the development of}} clonal lines have not been optimized. Here, we sought to develop a novel method for generation of clonal zebrafish by androgenesis induced by cold shock. Androgenetic zebrafish doubled haploids (DHs) were induced by cold shock of just-fertilized eggs, and the eggs were then heat shocked to double the chromosome set. The yield rate of putative DHs relative to the total number of eggs used was 1. 10 %[*]±[*] 0. 19 %. Microsatellite genotyping of the putative DHs using 30 loci that covered all 25 linkage groups detected no heterozygous loci, confirming the homozygosity of the DHs. Thus, a clonal line was established from sperm of a DH through a second cycle of cold-shock androgenesis and heat-shock chromosome doubling, followed by <b>genetic</b> <b>verification</b> of the isogenic rate confirming the presence of identical DNA fingerprints by using amplified fragment length polymorphism markers. In addition, our data provided important insights into the cytological mechanisms of cold-shock–induced androgenesis...|$|R

In Japan, several C 57 BL/ 6 derived from C 57 BL/ 6 J and C 57 BL/ 6 N substrains that are core substrains of C 57 BL/ 6 are commercially available from different sources. It {{has been reported that}} there are phenotypic differences between C 57 BL/ 6 J and C 57 BL/ 6 N substrains; however, the importance of their differences has not yet been well understood among biomedical researchers. Here, we report on the usage of C 57 BL/ 6 substrains for congenic and mutant strains in Japan. In Japan about 16 % of C 57 BL/ 6 background strains were from mixed or uncertain C 57 BL/ 6 substrains. We also carried out a screening on the functional deletion of the nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (Nnt) gene and comprehensive SNPs genotyping among C 57 BL/ 6 substrains, that data demonstrated there were clear genetic differences between C 57 BL/ 6 J and C 57 BL/ 6 N substrains.

40|$|The {{sensitive}} {{detection of}} bone marrow involvement {{is crucial for}} tumor staging at diagnosis and for monitoring of the therapeutic response in the patient’s follow-up. In neuroblastoma, only conventional cytomorphological techniques are presently accepted {{for the detection of}} bone marrow involvement, yet since the therapeutic consequences of the bone marrow findings may be far-reaching, the need for highly reliable detection methods has become evident. For this purpose, we developed an automatic immunofluorescence plus FISH (AIPF) device which allows the exact quantification of disseminated tumor cells and the <b>genetic</b> <b>verification</b> in critical cases. In this study, the power of the immunofluorescence technique is compared with conventional cytomorphology. 198 samples from 23 neuroblastoma patients (stages 4 and 4 s) at diagnosis and during follow-up were investigated. At diagnosis, 45. 6 % of the samples (26 of 57) which were positive by AIPF investigation were negative by cytomorphology. During follow-up, 74. 2 % (49 of 66) of AIPF-positive samples showed no cytological signs of tumor cell involvement. False negative morphological results were found in up to 10 % of tumor cell content. A tumor cell infiltrate below 0. 1 % was virtually not detectable by conventional cytomorphology. Using the sensitive immunofluorescence technique, the analysis of only two instead of four puncture sites did not lead to false negative results. Thus, the immunofluorescence technique offers an excellent tool for reliable detection and quantification of disseminated tumor cells at diagnosis and {{during the course of the}} disease...|$|R
40|$|Biodiversity of {{mangrove}} ecosystems {{is difficult}} to assess, at least partly {{due to lack of}} <b>genetic</b> <b>verification</b> of morphology-based documentation of species. Natural hybridization, on the one hand, {{plays an important role in}} evolution as a source of novel gene combinations and a mechanism of speciation. However, on the other hand, recurrent introgression allows gene flow between species and could reverse the process of genetic differentiation among populations required for speciation. To understand the dynamic evolutionary consequences of hybridization, this study examines genomic structure of hybrids and parental species at the population level. In the Indo-West Pacific, Bruguiera is one of the dominant mangrove genera and species ranges overlap extensively with one another. Morphological intermediates between sympatric Bruguiera gymnorrhiza and Bruguiera sexangula have been reported as a variety of B. sexangula or a new hybrid species, B. × rhynchopetala. However, the direction of hybridization and extent of introgression are unclear. A large number of species-specific inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers were found in B. gymnorrhiza and B. sexangula, and the additive ISSR profiling of B. × rhynchopetala ascertained its hybrid status and identified its parental origin. The varying degree of scatterness among hybrid individuals in Principal Coordinate Analysis and results from NewHybrids analysis indicate that B. × rhynchopetala comprises different generations of introgressants in addition to F 1 s. High genetic relatedness between B. × rhynchopetala and B. gymnorrhiza based on nuclear and chloroplast sequences suggests preferential hybrid backcrosses to B. gymnorrhiza. We conclude that B. × rhynchopetala has not evolved into an incipient hybrid species, and its persistence can be explained by recurrent hybridization and introgression. Genomic data provide insights into the hybridization dynamics of mangrove plants. Such information can assist in biodiversity assessment by helping detect novel taxa and/or define species boundaries. © 2011 Sun, Lo. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss {{sampling}} design for the calibration of water distribution system hydraulic models. The sampling design for the calibration of water distribution-system models is formulated as an optimisation problem consisting of two normalised objective functions. The first objective function is used to increase the calibration accuracy of the model parameters, and the second one is used {{to reduce the number}} of necessary measurement locations. The optimisation problem was solved by using <b>genetic</b> algorithms. The <b>verification</b> and application of the developed optimisation model (called IMMe) were carried out on the artificial water distribution system of Anytown, which serves as a reference model for testing various researches in hydraulic modelling. The verified IMMe model was applied to a real water-distribution system in the town of Sezana. For both water distribution models, the use of genetic algorithms proved very efficient with extremely combinatorial optimisation problems. The developed calibration and sampling design allow very accurate hydraulic modelling of the water distribution systems, which is of key importance for ensuring the economy and efficiency of drinking-water supplies in the future...|$|R

To prove the effectiveness of our approach, we applied it to the quantitative verification of a network protocol: the complexity of this problem prevents the application of exact techniques, while experimental results show that the verification results we obtained are better than one can achieve with traditional statistical methods.

40|$|We inv estigate the {{application}} of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) {{to search for the}} face of a particular individual in a two-dimensional intensity image. This problem has many potential applications such as locating a person in a crowd from pictures taken by surveillance cameras. There are two steps in solving this problem: first, faces regions must be extracted from the image (face detection) and second, candidate faces must be compared against the face of interest (face verification). Without any a-priori knowledge about location and size of a face in an image, every possible image location and face size must be considered, leading to a very large search space. In addition, face detection or verification invariant to lighting conditions, facial expression and pose make the search space even larger and more complex. In this paper, wepropose using GAs to search the image efficiently. Specifically, we use GAs to find image subwindows that contain the face of interest. Each subwindow isevaluated using a fitness function which contains two terms: the first term favors sub-windows containing faces while the second term favors sun-windows containing faces similar to the face of interest. Both terms have been defined using ideas from the method of &quot;eigenfaces&quot;. A set of increasingly complex scenes demonstrate the performance of the genetic search approach.

Prior to July 2015 all participating donors had to complete a paper-based questionnaire. Here we describe the establishment of a digital tablet-based questionnaire platform implemented in blood bank sites across Denmark. MethodsThe digital questionnaire was developed using the open source survey software tool LimeSurvey. The participants accesses the questionnaire online with a standard SSL encrypted HTTP connection using their personal civil registration numbers. The questionnaire is placed at a front-end web server and a collection server retrieves the completed questionnaires. Data from blood samples, register data, <b>genetic</b> data and <b>verification</b> of signed informed consent are then transferred to and merged with the questionnaire data in the DBDS database. ResultsThe digital platform enables personalized questionnaires, presenting only questions relevant to the specific donor by hiding unneeded follow-up questions on screening question results. New versions of questionnaires are immediately available at all blood collection facilities when new projects are initiated. ConclusionThe digital platform is a faster, cost-effective and more flexible solution to collect valid data from participating donors compared to paper-based questionnaires.

40|$|Drought {{is a major}} {{abiotic stress}} that limits wheat {{production}} worldwide. To ensure food security for the rapidly increasing world population, improving wheat yield under drought stress is urgent and relevant. In this study, an RNA-seq analysis was conducted to study the effect of drought on wheat transcriptome changes during reproductive stages under field conditions. Our results indicated that drought stress during early reproductive periods had a more severe impact on wheat development, gene expression and yield than drought stress during flowering. In total, 115, 656 wheat genes were detected, including 309 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) which responded to drought at various developmental stages. These DEGs were involved in many critical processes including floral development, photosynthetic activity and stomatal movement. At early developmental stages, the proteins of drought-responsive DEGs were mainly located in the nucleus, peroxisome, mitochondria, plasma membrane and chloroplast, indicating that these organelles play critical roles in drought tolerance in wheat. Furthermore, the validation of five DEGs confirmed their responsiveness to drought under different <b>genetic</b> backgrounds. Functional <b>verification</b> of DEGs of interest will occur in our subsequent research. Collectively, {{the results of this}} study not only advanced our understanding of wheat transcriptome changes under drought stress during early reproductive stages but also provided useful targets to manipulate drought tolerance in wheat at different development stages...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{undertake}} a systematic process of verification of consumer accounts of alleged <b>genetic</b> discrimination. Methods: <b>Verification</b> of incidents reported in life insurance and other contexts that {{met the criteria}} of genetic discrimination, {{and the impact of}} fear of such treatment, was determined, with consent, through interview, document analysis and where appropriate, direct contact with the third party involved. The process comprised obtaining evidence that the alleged incident was accurately reported and determining whether the decision or action seemed to be justifiable and/or ethical. Results: Reported incidents of genetic discrimination were verified in life insurance access, underwriting and coercion (9), applications for worker 2 ̆ 7 s compensation (1) and early release from prison (1) and in two cases of fear of discrimination impacting on access to genetic testing. Relevant conditions were inherited cancer susceptibility (8), Huntington disease (3), hereditary hemochromatosis (1), and polycystic kidney disease (1). In two cases, the reversal of an adverse underwriting decision to standard rate after intervention with insurers by genetics health professionals was verified. The mismatch between consumer and third party accounts in three life insurance incidents involved miscommunication or lack of information provision by financial advisers. Conclusion: These first cases of verified genetic discrimination make it essential for policies and guidelines to be developed and implemented to ensure appropriate use of genetic test results in insurance underwriting, to promote education and training in the financial industry, and to provide support for consumers and health professionals undertaking challenges of adverse decisions...|$|R

40|$|Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD), are {{associated}} with a polyglutamine expansion within a host protein. Pathological development is well studied, but not completely understood. Disease is thought to be related to protein aggregate formation in the cytoplasm, which localize to the nucleus as nuclear inclusions (NIs). Others have developed a polyglutamine disease model in Drosophila eye tissue, which expresses a disease-related gene, MJDtr-Q 78. The gene encodes for a protein, Q 78, which leads to neuronal toxicity in eye tissues and is easily identifiable. A potential modifier, which enhances this phenotype, was found in the 64 C region of Chromosome 3. Alleles that contained transposable element (TE) induced mutations within a gene in this region, alan shepard (shep), were found to enhance the phenotype. <b>Genetic</b> and molecular <b>verification</b> show that the enhancement is directly linked to the TE, which suggests shep influences the toxicity caused by the toxic protein. Genomic analyses suggest shep encodes for an RNA binding protein. A histo-immunochemical stain reveals shep does not affect aggregate or NI formation, indicating an indirect relationship with polyglutamine diseases. shep does not modify a second polyglutamine-associated disease background, 97 QP. This suggests that shep influences independent of the polyglutamine expansion tract. An investigation of the biological significance of shep reveals that the gene is required for development past pupation. Together these data support the current model, which is, although polyglutamine diseases are related to an expansion of the polyglutamine tract, their disease development can be independent of each other. ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2008. This study {{compared}} DNA based SSR markers {{with total}} seed protein markers, {{used to evaluate}} genetic diversity of sunflower. The multiplex-ability, cost effectiveness and applicability of microsatellites as molecular markers for a genetic diversity study were investigated and evaluated based on pedigree data of the sunflower germplasm. A solution for oil and fat interference in ultrathin iso-electric focusing gels was investigated, {{in order to make}} imaging and interpretation easier and clearer. Total protein analysis was utilized for the determination of genetic diversity on the same inbred material used for the DNA analysis. Finally a correlation is made between the data obtained on DNA vs Protein compared with phenotype and expected pedigree data. A set of 73 SSR markers with known mapped positions were utilized to determine genetic similarity in a group of sunflower inbred lines. Cluster analysis of genetic similarity revealed an excellent correlation with the breeding background and source information obtained from breeders on all inbred lines used in this study. Cluster analysis gave a clear differentiation between B and R-lines, showing clearly defined heterotic groups of the proprietary set of inbred lines. The most outstanding single-locus SSR markers in the set used for this study were identified and used as a core set. Multiplex assays were designed and optimized for the most cost and time effective method for rapid variety identification. The selected markers produced robust PCR products, amplified a single locus each, were polymorphic among the elite inbred lines and supplied a good, genome-wide framework of completely co-dominant, single-locus DNA markers for molecular breeding. The use of a fluorescent-tailed primer technique resulted in a considerable cost saving. Furthermore, the SSR markers can be multiplexed through optimization, in order to avoid undesirable primer-primer interactions and non-specific amplification. First stage iso-electric focusing of total protein extracts were used to analyze sunflower looking at genetic purity and <b>genetic</b> variety <b>verification</b> on diverse sunflower germplasm. Severe visual interference was visible on most seed storage protein extracts of sunflower. This interference was visible as a distortion in the gel matrix on the anodal end of the gel, and caused important proteins to denature in the presence of heightened field strength and the absence of a uniform matrix. Adjustment of the extraction solutions removed this interference. Total protein profiles were generated with the use ultrathin layer iso-electric focusing (UTLIEF) to assess the level of genetic diversity on the same set of sunflower lines used for the SSR analysis. Finally, the genetic diversity of the sunflower germplasm was analysed by comparing proteomic, genomic and pedigree data from the same germplasm. A total of 295 alleles were amplified with a set of 73 SSR markers with known mapped positions. These were utilized to determine the genetic relatedness of a group of B-lines and R-lines of sunflower. In parallel, a total of 68 protein bands were visualized using protein samples of two types of seed storage proteins derived from exactly the same sunflower lines. Cluster analysis clearly differentiated between the B-lines and R-lines, identifying defined heterotic groups of this proprietary set of lines. The comparison of DNA and protein data for the application of genetic diversity studies is analysed, as well as the general comparison {{on the use of the}} two different molecules as markers...|$|R
