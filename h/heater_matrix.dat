5000|$|The Lotus Seven S2 {{followed}} in 1960 and was supplemented by the Lotus Super Seven S2 from 1961. The Super Seven initially used the larger Cosworth modified 1340cc Ford Classic engine and later examples were fitted with 1498cc or 1599cc engines. The Seven S3 {{was released in}} 1968. In 1970, Lotus radically changed {{the shape of the}} car to create the slightly more conventional sized Series 4 (S4), with a squarer fibreglass shell replacing most of the aluminium bodywork. It also offered some [...] "luxuries" [...] as standard, such as an internal <b>heater</b> <b>matrix.</b>|$|E
50|$|The air (which {{is to be}} cooled), often {{after being}} {{filtered}} by a cabin air filter, is blowed by an adjustable speed electric powered centrifugal blower across the evaporator, causing the liquid part of the cold refrigerant mixture to evaporate as well, further lowering the temperature. The warm air is therefore cooled, and also deprived of any humidity (which condenses on the evaporator coils and is drained outside of the vehicle) in the process. It is then passed through an <b>heater</b> <b>matrix,</b> inside of which the engine's coolant circulates, {{where it can be}} reheated to a certain degree or even a certain temperature selected by the user and then delivered inside the vehicle's cabin through a set of adjustable vents. The user is also given the option to close the vehicle's external air flaps, in order to achieve even faster and stronger cooling by recirculating the air inside the cabin.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} und fabrication of a thermal test chip (TTC) {{to be used for}} thermal characterisation and qualification of materials and packages. The TTC is designed as a modular chip with the smallest full functional chip cell of 3. 2 mm × 3. 2 mm and consists of a heater structure and a temperature sensor. The chips can be applied in any required <b>matrix.</b> <b>Heater</b> and temperature sensors are realised by a 70 nm single Titanium layer as adhesion and barrier layer. The Titanium is structured a on 670 μm silicon wafer by the cost efficient thin film technology. 3 × 3 matrix chips have been sawn, assembled on a FR 4 substrate by flip chip technology and integrated into a test stand for characterisation of thermal interface materials (TIMA Tester). The calibration curves of the temperature sensors show 4 -time higher sensitivity then Si diodes. The homogeneity of the surface temperature was checked by the Lock-In infra-red thermography and compared with a commercial thermo test chip...|$|R
