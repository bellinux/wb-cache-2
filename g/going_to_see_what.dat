[...] The main idea behind the episode, was that God knows all the numbers, because they are his numbers and he is laying them down and is in [...] "charge of the big game". Being that God is trying to show us the game, as it was a [...] "game" [...] to be [...] "won or lost", and Wayne has lost this game.|$|E
