40|$|The goal of {{information}} layout is to physically display information {{to reinforce the}} underlying structure of the information. In this paper, I describe an axiomatic model {{of information}} layout. The model has three levels: (1) a device-independent representation for structured information, (2) a set of axioms (or rules) relating information structure with <b>display</b> <b>attributes,</b> (3) a set of devjce dependent <b>display</b> <b>attributes</b> used to distinguish differences and show similarities in information structure.

40|$|In natural {{language}} queries/commands to an intelligent multimodal system, {{a particular kind}} of ambiguity [...] source ambiguity [...] can arise between items in a visual display and entities in the domain being represented.

40|$|Dagger is a {{tool that}} generates program graphs to {{selectively}} visualize a software structure. The design of dagger achieves a strong degree of language independence by exploiting the duality between a class of entity-relationship databases and attributed directed graphs. This paper describes the C and C++ versions of dagger, which map a selected subset of relationships stored in a program database to a graph specification, decorate the graph with <b>display</b> <b>attributes,</b> and then pass it to layout tools or interactive graph browsers. Dagger takes output from database queries to generate a large variety of interesting program graphs, including header file hierarchy, module binding, and type inheritance graphs.

In particular, we describe how a closure operator works in tandem with dagger to control graph complexity by generating reachability graphs where sub-structures are selec [...] ...|$|E
