50|$|Ts (Russian: Ц) - {{low-power}} rectifier (<b>kenotron).</b>|$|E
50|$|He {{helped to}} develop the <b>Kenotron</b> and Pliotron, two- and three-electrode vacuum tubes, which could be {{exhausted}} to an exceedingly high vacuum.|$|E
5000|$|Essentially, he {{referred}} to all his vacuum tube designs as Kenotrons, the Pliotron basically being a specialized type of <b>Kenotron.</b> However, because Pliotron and <b>Kenotron</b> were registered trademarks, technical writers tended to use the more generic term [...] "vacuum tube". By the mid-1920s, the term [...] "Kenotron" [...] had come to exclusively refer to vacuum tube rectifiers, while the term [...] "Pliotron" [...] had fallen into disuse. Ironically, in popular usage, the sound-alike brands [...] "Radiotron" [...] and [...] "Ken-Rad" [...] outlasted the original names.|$|E
50|$|However {{he took a}} {{somewhat}} unorthodox approach. Instead of trying to stabilize the partial vacuum, he {{wondered if it was}} possible to make the Audion function with the total vacuum of a <b>Kenotron,</b> since that was somewhat easier to stabilize.|$|E
50|$|Later, when {{vacuum tube}} {{equipment}} {{began to be}} powered from wall power by transformers instead of batteries, the Fleming valve was developed into a rectifier to produce the DC plate (anode) voltage required by other vacuum tubes. Around 1914 Irving Langmuir at General Electric developed a high voltage version called the <b>Kenotron</b> which was used to power x-ray tubes. As a rectifier, the tube was used for high voltage applications but its high internal resistance made it inefficient in low voltage, high current applications. Until vacuum tube equipment was replaced by transistors in the 1970s, radios and televisions usually had one or more diode tubes.|$|E
50|$|In 1904, {{he invented}} the two-electrode {{vacuum-tube}} rectifier, {{which he called}} the oscillation valve, for which he received a patent on 16 November. It was also called a thermionic valve, vacuum diode, <b>kenotron,</b> thermionic tube, or Fleming valve. The Supreme Court of the United States later invalidated the patent because of an improper disclaimer and, additionally, maintained the technology in the patent was known art when filed. This invention is often considered {{to have been the}} beginning of electronics, for this was the first vacuum tube. Fleming's diode was used in radio receivers and radars for many decades afterwards, until it was superseded by solid state electronic technology more than 50 years later.|$|E

40|$|The {{thermionic}} current {{produced by}} the emission of free negative electrons {{from the surface of}} heated metals is described in detail. Its theoretical magnitude is calculated for certain definite cases. The limitation of thermionic currents by space charges around the cathode (in high vacua) is explained. In reviewing the bibliography of the subject, it is shown that the preponderance of opinion before the most recent and careful experiments was to the effect the thermionic currents could not be obtained in a pure vacuum. The incorrectness of this conclusion is experimentally proven. The degree of cleanliness of the electrodes and the completeness of exhaustion required to produce these thermionic currents in regular fashion is unusual. With true thermionic currents, the cathode does not disintegrate, and there is no blue glow {{in the path of the}} cathode rays even at the highest voltages. An X-ray tube using thermionic currents is described. A rectifier for high voltage alternating current (“kenotron”) is considered, its operating characteristics being given. By inserting a third fine wire grid electrode in a <b>kenotron,</b> an amplifying device (“pliotron”) is obtained. Its theory, construction, and characteristics are given. Its use in radio receiving stations as a detector or amplifier is described. The “exponential ” method of tuning, involving the use of radio frequency pliotron amplifiers in cascade, is shown to have given remarkable selectivity. The pliotron may also be used as a powerful generator of radio frequency energy; or for the modulation or control of such energy. A 20 -W radio telephone transmitter, and a 500 -W radio telephone outfit are each described in detail. I...|$|E
