The fast led to nationwide protests in support. The fast ended on 9 April, one day after the government accepted his demands. The government issued a gazette notification on the formation of a joint committee, consisting of government and civil society representatives, to draft the legislation.|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, {{the company}} {{moved out of}} the Jan Hus to the {{legitimate}} Off-Broadway Eastside Playhouse, just across E. 74th Street. [...] This 284-seat house was still intimate, but the company could generate substantially more revenues than it could <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jan</b> Hus basement. In addition, the theatre had better stage facilities, good seating, stage lighting and a balcony. All the sight-lines were good, whereas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jan</b> Hus there were vertical poles interfering with some views. At Jan Hus, the company's staging had been designed to refer to the positions of these poles, and even after the company moved to the Eastside Playhouse, choreographer Jerry Gotham (a former Broadway dancer) taught the staging of the shows in the repertory by reference to the imaginary positions of the poles, as they had existed at Jan Hus. While at the Eastside Playhouse, LOOM published a music book containing an introduction by Raymond Allen and many photographs of the company in its Gilbert and Sullivan productions.|$|E
2500|$|Founded by William Mount-Burke, LOOM's first {{long-term}} {{home was}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jan</b> Hus theatre {{from the late}} 1960s to 1975, where it succeeded another small light opera company, the American Savoyards. [...] At the Jan Hus, LOOM performed predominantly the Savoy operas of Gilbert and Sullivan, such as The Pirates of Penzance, The Mikado and H.M.S. Pinafore. [...] Led by conductor-director Mount-Burke, principal comedian Raymond Allen and choreographer/stage manager Jerry Gotham, the company mentored many young actors and singers {{who went on to}} careers on Broadway or elsewhere in theatre or music.|$|E

2500|$|Cars {{built before}} 1919 are classed as veteran cars and later models as vintage cars. Today, four main clubs exist {{to support the}} {{preservation}} and restoration of these cars: the Model T Ford Club International, the Model T Ford Club of America and the combined clubs of Australia. With many chapters of clubs around the world, the Model T Ford Club of Victoria has a membership with {{a considerable number of}} uniquely Australian cars. (Australia produced its own car bodies, and therefore many differences occurred between the Australian bodied tourers and the US/Canadian cars.) In the UK, the Model T Ford Register of Great Britain celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2010. Many steel Model T parts are still manufactured today, and even fiberglass replicas of their distinctive bodies are produced, which are popular for T-bucket style hot rods (as immortalized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jan</b> and Dean surf music song [...] "Bucket T", which was later recorded by The Who). In 1949, more than twenty {{years after the end of}} production, 200,000 Model Ts were registered in the United States. In 2008, it was estimated that about 50,000 to 60,000 Ford Model Ts remain roadworthy.|$|E
2500|$|On July 24, 2014, it was {{announced}} that Diaz had signed a three-fight contract to return to the UFC. Diaz faced Anderson Silva on January 31, 2015 at UFC 183. He lost the fight by unanimous decision (46–49, 45–50, and 45–50). [...] A few days after the fight, the UFC revealed that Diaz had once again failed his post-fight drug test for marijuana metabolites, and Silva tested positive on January 9 for drostanolone, androstane, oxazepem, and temazepem in pre-fight drug screening. On August 13, after several reschedules, Silva's disciplinary hearing was held to decide on the subject. Silva's defense argued that a tainted sexual enhancement supplement was the root of the two failed tests for drostanolone and also appealed to mistakes in the NSAC testing procedures, pointing to a pair of drug tests, one on Jan 19 and one after the fight, which Silva passed. He admitted to using both temazepem and oxazepem, benzodiazepines, the night prior to the fight as therapy to control stress and help him sleep. Silva's team was unable to explain the presence of androsterone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Jan</b> 9 test. The commission rejected the defense and suspended him for one year retroactive to the date of the fight, as the current guidelines were not in effect {{at the time of the}} failed tests. Silva was also fined his full win bonus, as well as 30% of his show money, totaling $380,000. The result was overturned to a no contest.|$|E
