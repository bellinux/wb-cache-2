25|$|Akitas {{tend to take}} a {{socially}} dominant role with other dogs, and thus caution must be used in situations when Akitas {{are likely to be}} around other dogs, especially unfamiliar ones. In particular, Akitas tend to be less tolerant of dogs of the same sex. For this reason, Akitas, unless highly socialized, are not generally well-suited for off-leash dog parks. The Akita is said to be careful, courageous, fearless, and intelligent. Sometimes spontaneous, <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> confident, consistent handler, without which the dog will be very wilful and may become very aggressive to other dogs and animals.|$|E

It is first used in Chamber of Secrets to allow Harry and Ron to transform into Crabbe and Goyle {{so that they can}} question Draco Malfoy about the Heir of Slytherin. The potion is one of the complicated ones, as <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> month to be cooked.|$|E

25|$|The Software Configuration Management system, is {{a system}} at the vendor’s site which keeps track of the {{configurations}} at the customer site. By storing this in a system the vendor {{will be able to}} give the customer particular service when <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> new product. In the software configuration management system information about the products used by the customer, the version of these products, as well as which updates are already being done, is stored. In some cases {{it is possible that the}} vendor did some modifications to the product particularly for this customer. This will also have to be stored in the system. Also there needs to be configuration data, some generic information about the configuration the customer is using. For example what operating platform the customer uses for its software. What also should be stored in this system is information about the feedback that the vendor gets from the customer. This includes bug reports, product usage data, error reports and usage questions. More information about this feedback can be found in the CCU phase activation and usage.|$|E
25|$|Suda's {{style of}} writing and {{direction}} {{has been compared to}} the works of Quentin Tarantino. A defining part of Suda's original work has been its balance of humor, dark or mature themes, violence and sexuality. His focus on death is because he feels <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> rationale behind it, and so he focuses on those closely tied with death such as assassins. In his action titles, he considered the reasons behind each character's wish to fight and the reason for their deaths. His portrayal of death in his games was influenced by his time as an undertaker. Sexuality, while a big part of many of Suda's works, is not an important element from his perspective, and when used he is attempting to express a core part of the overall story and theme. Another recurring theme in his work from The Silver Case onwards is the focus on the criminal elements in society, in addition to people with equally valid views coming into conflict with each other. Following the serious tone of The Silver Case, Flower, Sun, and Rain saw a stylistic shift to a more light and casual tone. This approach of switching styles for each successive original project would be repeated by Suda throughout his career: when talking about the contrast between Lollipop Chainsaw and Killer is Dead he described is as a yin-yang effect.|$|E

[...] Rothman added that [...] "what it really needs is, <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> visionary at the level that Chris Nolan was.

[...] By February 2010, 20th Century Fox and New Regency were looking to develop the reboot with News Corp., with Peter Chernin producing and David Scarpa writing the script. On March 15, 2011, it was announced that filmmaker David Slade would be directing the reboot, [...] but he later had to drop out due to other obligations. Fringe writer and producer Brad Caleb Kane was hired to pen the Slade-directed film. On September 3, 2012, Duncan died, precluding him from reprising his role as Kingpin.|$|E

500|$|A dynamo can amplify a {{magnetic}} field, but <b>it</b> <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> [...] "seed" [...] field {{to get it}} started. For the Earth, {{this could have been}} an external magnetic field. Early in its history the Sun went through a T-Tauri phase in which the solar wind would have had {{a magnetic}} field orders of magnitude larger than the present solar wind. However, much of the field may have been screened out by the Earth's mantle. An alternative source is currents in the core-mantle boundary driven by chemical reactions or variations in thermal or electric conductivity.

500|$|Roger Ebert gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} film with {{three out of four}} stars, saying, [...] "As pure movie, The X-Files more or less works.

You really can't treat The X-Files as a movie because it isn't one. It's a two-hour episode of the show," [...] and said it was far from the [...] "most satisfying" [...] of X-Files releases. San Francisco Chronicle reviewer Bob Graham was positive towards the film, calling [...] "David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson [...] enormously sympathetic heroes."

500|$|On February 3, 2005, it was {{announced}} that Enterprise had been cancelled. This news was passed to the cast and crew during the sixth day of production on [...] "In a Mirror, Darkly". The end of the series marked the first time in 18 years that no new Star Trek episodes were scheduled for broadcast, and Enterprise was the first live-action series of the franchise since The Original Series to last less than seven years. Braga said at a talk to students in Los Angeles shortly after the news of the cancellation was released that [...] "After 18 straight years on the air and 750-some episodes the current run of Star Trek is over. Which is a good thing. <b>It</b> <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> rest".

500|$|The {{common loon}} {{is an expert}} fisher, {{catching}} its prey underwater by diving as deep as [...] With its large webbed feet, the common loon is an efficient underwater pursuit predator and adroit diver. <b>It</b> <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> long run-up distance to gain momentum for flight take-off, and is ungainly on land, sliding on its belly and pushing itself forward with its legs. Its clumsiness on land {{is due to the}} legs being positioned at the rear of its body; their pelvic muscles are well developed, ideal for swimming but not well-suited for walking. When it lands on water, it skims along on its belly to slow down, rather than braking with its feet, as they are set too far back. The common loon swims and dives well, and flies competently for hundreds of kilometres in migration. It flies with its neck outstretched, usually calling a particular tremolo {{that can be used to}} identify a flying loon. Its flying speed is as much as [...] during migration.|$|E

In contrast to Inhofe, Arizona Republican Senator John McCain, did not criticize Gore's efforts or the movie, which he planned to see. Tennessee Republican Senator Lamar Alexander, said [...] "Because (Gore) was a former vice president and presidential nominee, he brings a lot of visibility to (the issue)," [...] Alexander said. [...] "On the other hand it may be seen as political by some, and they may be less eager {{to be a part of}} it." [...] Alexander also criticized the omission of nuclear power in the film.

500|$|Eastwood said he {{has always}} opposed war and is a pragmatic Libertarian rather than a red-meat Republican.

And four years later, I was standing at the draft board being drafted during the Korean conflict, and then after that there was Vietnam, and it goes on and on forever … I just wonder … does this ever stop? And no, it doesn't. So each time we get in these conflicts, it deserves a lot of thought before we go wading in or wading out. Going in or coming out. <b>It</b> <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> better thought process, I think." [...] Furthermore, Eastwood's 2014 movie American Sniper was met with strong critical praise, especially from many Republicans who called it a pro-War on Terror, pro-Republican, and patriotic film; Eastwood responded by saying that such notions represented a [...] "stupid analysis" [...] and that the movie had nothing to do with political parties. Eastwood responded to critics of American Sniper by saying his film was [...] "the biggest anti-war statement any film can make", and that the film depicts [...] "the fact of what [...] does to the family and the people who have to go back into civilian life like Chris Kyle did" [...] and [...] "what it (war) does to the people left behind." ...|$|E
500|$|The Moving Picture World gave it minor {{praise and}} short {{summary of the}} film, {{but it does not}} {{evaluate}} or describe the special camera effects used to produce the film. The reviewer states: [...] "To see the doll and the pumpkin suddenly assume life is interesting and naturally causes the little girl to whom they belong surprise. The good times they have with the fairy's help will long remain in her memory, even though it is only a dream." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror was critical of the production, stating [...] "This sounds as if it ought to be very clever, but aside from the work of the little heroine and the dance of the fairies it is entirely uninspired. <b>It</b> <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> drastic application of imagination. The broad idea is excellent, but the details of the management indicate impoverished resources. When the aid of fairies is invoked it opens up all sorts of avenues of fanciful treatment, but this film doesn't get away from stolid realities. For example, nobody could imagine anything more earthly than the outside of the house from which the little girl escaped with the fairy queen and her comrades. That should have been treated fancifully. The events pictured don't amount to anything; there is a sameness about them, nothing surprising happens, and not very much that is pretty. Worst of all is the poetry(?), which is interpolated to explain the narrative; that is beyond criticism. The Thanhouser Company has missed good opportunities in this film." [...] The strange inclusion of the question mark after poetry is not a note by Bowers, for it was actually written into the review itself in the edition. Though no other review mentions poetry.|$|E
