Similarly structured to the NLAES, the survey conducted in-person interviews with 43,093 individuals. This time, {{respondents were asked}} if they had ever attended a 12-step meeting for an alcohol problem in their lifetime (the question was not AA-specific). 1441 (3.4%) of respondents answered the question affirmatively. Answers were further broken down into three categories: disengaged, those who started attending {{at some point in the}} past but had ceased attending at some point in the past year (988); continued engagement, those who started attending at some point in the past and continued to attend <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>year</b> (348); and newcomers, those who started attending <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>year</b> (105). In their discussion of the findings, Kaskautas et al. (2008) state that to study disengagement, only the disengaged and continued engagement should be utilized (pg. 270).|$|E

25|$|The Clanton Ranch {{grew into}} a {{successful}} enterprise. During his testimony after the shootout at the O.K.

However, the Clantons never registered a brand in either Cochise County or Pima County which was required to legally raise cattle. The Clantons were reputed to be among a group of outlaw Cowboys who crossed the border into Mexico where they stole cattle and re-sold them to the hungry miners in Cochise County. Curly Bill Brocius, Tom and Frank McLaury bought and sold stolen cattle to Old Man Clanton, among others. The Mexican government at the time placed high tariffs on goods transported across the border, making smuggling a profitable enterprise.|$|E
25|$|On 2 June 2003, Coast Air {{started its}} first head-on {{competition}} with Scandinavian Airlines. Using the ATR planes, Coast Air started with two daily round services between Haugesund and Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. By September, Coast Air increased to three daily round trips, and reduced prices to NOK500. From 9 October, Scandinavian Airlines reduced their prices by 22% {{on the route}}. On 16 February, Coast Air also started competing with Braathens and Widerøe on the route between Stavanger and Bergen, marketing it as a low-fare service and ticket prices as low as NOK199. The Haugesund–Oslo route cost Coast Air NOK11 million in 2003. In March 2004, Coast Air was forced to close the Stord to Oslo route, after several reductions in frequency <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>year.</b> To create more inertia on the Bergen–Stavanger route, Coast Air also started a cooperation with DAT, where the latter flew an extra daily round trip. Following the losses of the Haugesund–Oslo and Bergen–Stavanger routes, they were terminated in May 2004. In December, the Norwegian Competition Authority started investigating Scandinavian Airlines for illegal price dumping on the Oslo–Haugesund route. The authority suspected that SAS had illegally cross-subsidized the route {{to fend off the}} competition, and announced the company would be fined NOK20 million. The case ended in Oslo District Court, where Scandinavian Airlines was found not guilty. Though initially appealed by the authority, the matter was settled out-of-court in December 2007, in which the airline agreed that they had broken the law, but that since it happened just after the act came into power, they would not have to pay the fine.|$|E

25|$|On February 19, 1977, Wonder was {{nominated}} for seven Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, an award that he had already won twice, in 1974 and 1975, for Innervisions and Fulfillingness’ First Finale. Since 1973, Stevie’s presence at the Grammy ceremonies had been consistent – he attended most of the ceremonies and also used to perform on stage. But in 1976, he did not attend as he was not nominated for any awards (as he had not released any new material <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>year).</b> Paul Simon, who received the Grammy for Album of the Year in that occasion (for Still Crazy After All These Years) jokingly thanked Stevie “for not releasing an album” that year. A year after, Wonder {{was nominated}} for Songs in the Key of Life in that same category, and was widely favored by many critics to take the award. The other nominees were Breezin’ by George Benson, Chicago X by Chicago, Silk Degrees by Boz Scaggs, and the other favorite, Peter Frampton’s Frampton Comes Alive!, which was also a huge critical and commercial success. Wonder was again absent from the ceremony, as he had developed an interest in visiting Africa. In February he traveled to Nigeria for two weeks, primarily to explore his musical heritage, as he put it. A satellite hook-up was arranged so that Stevie could be awarded his Grammys from across the sea. Bette Midler announced the results during the ceremony, and the audience was only able to see Wonder at a phone smiling and giving thanks. The video signal was poor and the audio inaudible. Andy Williams went on to make a public blunder when he asked the blind-since-birth Wonder, “Stevie, can you see us?” In all, Wonder won four out of seven nominations at the Grammys: Album of the Year, Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, Best Male R Vocal Performance and Producer of the Year.|$|E
25|$|Real Madrid {{rallied to}} defeat Málaga at home 3–2 {{in the first}} leg of the round of 16 in the Copa del Rey on January 3. Defenders Sergio Sánchez and Martín Demichelis {{converted}} headers from corners to give Málaga a 2–0 lead, prompting Mourinho to bring on Mesut Özil, Sami Khedira and Karim Benzema at half-time. Madrid then scored three goals through Khedira, Gonzalo Higuaín and Benzema over a ten-minute period for the victory. Rui Faria was again dismissed for protesting a refereeing decision. On January 7, Real Madrid won their first La Liga game of the year 5–1 against Granada at home. Prior to kickoff, Iker Casillas received an award from medical supplier Sanitas for being the healthiest squad member <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>year</b> as voted by fans. Benzema opened the scoring following an Özil backheel pass, one of his three assists in the match, but Granada equalized three minutes later through Mikel Rico. Sergio Ramos, Higuaín, Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo added further goals in the victory. Real Madrid extended their La Liga lead to five points after Barcelona drew against Espanyol the following day. On January 10, Real Madrid defeated Málaga 0–1 in the second leg of the Copa del Rey and progressed to the quarter-finals 4–2 on aggregate. An error by Málaga keeper Willy Caballero allowed Benzema to score the winning goal in the 72nd minute. Álvaro Arbeloa made his 100th appearance for Real Madrid but was sent off late in the match. Real Madrid staged another comeback win on January 14, defeating Mallorca away 1–2. Tomer Hemed scored with a header in the 39th minute for Mallorca before Higuaín and José Callejón scored second half goals to give Madrid the win. Real Madrid lost to Barcelona at home in {{the first leg of}} the Copa del Rey quarter-finals on January 18. Ronaldo scored early, but second half goals from defenders Carles Puyol and Éric Abidal resulted in a 1–2 defeat. On January 22, Real Madrid ended {{the first half of the}} season as league leaders with a five-point advantage after beating Athletic Bilbao at home 4–1. Fernando Llorente scored early for the visitors but Real Madrid eventually raced to clear 4–1 victory with two penalties from Ronaldo and goals from Marcelo and Callejón. In January 25, Madrid was eliminated from Copa del Rey by Barcelona after a 2–2 draw at Camp Nou; Barcelona qualified 4–3 on aggregate. The home side was leading after the first half 2–0 with the goals from Pedro and Dani Alves, despite Real Madrid being the dominating side. In the second half, Real Madrid leveled Barcelona with the goals from Ronaldo and Benzema. On January 28, Real Madrid extended their lead in La Liga to seven points after beating Real Zaragoza home 3–1 while Barcelona could only conjure up a goalless draw away to Villarreal. Zaragoza took the lead in the 11th minute when Ángel Lafita scored for the visitors. Real Madrid, however, once again came from behind to finish with a comfortable win with goals from Kaká, Ronaldo and Özil.|$|E
