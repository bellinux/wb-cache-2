Originally measuring 8 feet wide, the bridge was built in 1971 and then demolished in 2005 to be reconstructed. It was officially replaced in 2007 by a new $ 9. 5 million bridge measuring 48 feet in width, six {{times larger than the}} old structure. The bridge, located on I- 195, connects the Fox Point neighborhood on Providence’s East Side to the waterfront at <b>India</b> <b>Point</b> Park. [URL]...|$|R

50|$|<b>India</b> <b>Point,</b> on the Providence {{side in the}} {{northeast}} part of the shoal, was Providence's first port, established in 1680.

By the 1940s, after being battered by the 1938 New England hurricane, commerce largely ceased and {{it turned into a}} scrap yard.
