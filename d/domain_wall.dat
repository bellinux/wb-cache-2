25|$|Though some {{of their}} amplitudes have {{opposite}} phases, both quarks and anti-quarks have positive energy, and hence acquire the same phase as they move in space-time. This phase also depends on their mass, which is identical but depends both on flavor and on the Higgs VEV which changes along the <b>domain</b> <b>wall.</b> Thus certain sums of amplitudes for quarks have different absolute values compared to those of anti-quarks. In all, quarks and anti-quarks may have different reflection and transmission probabilities through the <b>domain</b> <b>wall,</b> {{and it turns out}} that more quarks coming from the unbroken phase are transmitted compared to anti-quarks.|$|E
25|$|In this scenario, non-perturbative electroweak {{interactions}} (i.e. the sphaleron) {{are responsible}} for the B-violation, the perturbative electroweak Lagrangian is responsible for the CP-violation, and the <b>domain</b> <b>wall</b> is responsible for the lack of thermal equilibrium; together with the CP-violation it also creates a C-violation in each of its sides.|$|E
25|$|Thus {{there is}} a net baryonic flux through the <b>domain</b> <b>wall.</b> Due to sphaleron transitions, which are {{abundant}} in the unbroken phase, the net anti-baryonic content of the unbroken phase is wiped off. However, sphalerons are rare enough in the broken phase as not to wipe off the excess of baryons there. In total, there is net creation of baryons.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the structural and electronic properties of <b>domain</b> <b>walls</b> {{to achieve a}} better understanding of the conduction mechanisms in <b>domain</b> <b>walls</b> of lithium niobate and the polarity of <b>domain</b> <b>walls</b> in calcium titanate. In a first part, we discuss the interaction between defects and <b>domain</b> <b>walls</b> in lithium niobate. A dielectric resonance with a low activation energy is observed, which vanishes under thermal annealing in monodomain samples while it remains stable in periodically poled samples. Therefore we propose that <b>domain</b> <b>walls</b> stabilize polaronic states. We also report the evolution of Raman modes with increasing amount of magnesium in congruent lithium niobate. We identified specific frequency shifts of the modes at the <b>domain</b> <b>walls.</b> The <b>domains</b> <b>walls</b> appear then as spaces where polar defects are stabilized. In a second step, we use mirror electron microscopy (MEM) and low energy electron microscopy (LEEM) to characterize the <b>domains</b> and <b>domain</b> <b>walls</b> at the surface of magnesium-doped lithium niobate. We demonstrate that out of focus settings can be used to determine the domain polarization. At <b>domain</b> <b>walls,</b> a local stray, lateral electric field arising from different surface charge states is observed. In a second part, we {{investigate the}} polarity of <b>domain</b> <b>walls</b> in calcium titanate. We use resonant piezoelectric spectroscopy to detect elastic resonances induced by an electric field, which is interpreted as a piezoelectric response of the walls. A direct image of the <b>domain</b> <b>walls</b> in calcium titanate is also obtained by LEEM, showing a clear contrast in surface potential between <b>domains</b> and <b>walls.</b> This contrast is observed to change reversibly upon electron irradiation due to the screening of polarization charges at <b>domain</b> <b>walls...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Chen and Wang, {{researchers}} at disk-drive manufacturer Seagate Technology described three examples of possible magnetic memristors.

Electrons flowing into the device have a certain spin, which alters the device's magnetization state.

40|$|The {{profiles}} of antiferromagnetic <b>domain</b> <b>walls</b> in hexagonal manganites RMnO 3 are obtained numerically depending on anisotropy and internal strain {{due to the}} lattice distortion at the ferroelectric <b>domain</b> <b>walls.</b> It is found that the piezomagnetism can lower the free energy of the system thus it favors the coupling between electric and magnetic <b>domain</b> <b>walls.</b> Due to the piezomagnetic effect, the clamped antiferromagnetic <b>domain</b> <b>walls</b> with spin orientation angle φ changing from 0 to π have different profiles comparing with those of φ changing from 0 to-π, and the former is energetically more favorable than the latter when the internal strain is tensile at the FEL <b>domain</b> <b>walls</b> while it is the contrary for compressive strain.
