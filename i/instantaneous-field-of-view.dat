40|$|Design and {{performance}} data are analyzed for the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II (SAGE II) instrument, {{which has been}} developed for the NASA Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS). SAGE II is designed to monitor globally, from 70 degrees S to 70 degrees N latitude, the vertical distribution of stratospheric aerosols, ozone, water vapor, and nitrogen dioxide by measuring the extinction of solar radiation through the earth's atmosphere during the ERBS observatory solar occultations. A flat scanning mirror reflects solar radiation into a Cassegrain type telescope, which forms a solar image on the entrance slit of a grating spectrometer. The <b>instantaneous-field-of-view</b> of the SAGE II is scanned along the vertical solar diameter by the elevation scan mirror. The optical system is contained within an azimuth gimbal which tracks the solar radiometric centroid during the data event, while the spectrometer isolates seven spectral wavelengths from 0. 385 - 1. 02 micrometers. The seven channels of the spectrometer use silicon photodiode dedectors operated in the photovoltaic mode. The detector outputs are multiplexed into a serial data stream for readout by the ERBS telemetry system, with each output being sampled 64 times per second and digitized to 12 bit resolution...|$|E
40|$|Because of the {{resolution}} limitations in remote sensing, the radiance recorded by the detector at each pixel is the integrated sum of the spectral radiance of all materials within the detector <b>instantaneous-field-of-view</b> (IFOV). If the detector IFOV covers more than one object class, the radiance detected is not characteristic of any single class but a mixture of all classes. These mixed pixels will have spectral signatures that fall within the convex hull formed by the signatures of all the classes. Traditional classifiers are therefore usually left with many misclassified or unclassified pixels. To remedy this problem, unmixing algorithms which decompose each pixel into a combination of several classes have been successfully applied to estimate the percentage of each class inside one pixel. In this dissertation, unmixing error of the least squares unmixing algorithm that {{is caused by the}} intrinsic data variance, system PSF blurring, detection noise, and band-to-band misregistration is analyzed and evaluated. For high unmixing accuracy, image restoration is proposed to remove the PSF blurring degradation. To objectively assess the restoration performance and expedite the design of our application-oriented restoration scheme, and objective criterion based on the measurement of spectral fidelity in frequency domain is suggested. Based on this criterion, a detailed comparison between the conventional Wiener filter and sampled Wiener filter is conducted, which highlights the significance of sampling aliasing and verifies the results obtained visually by other researchers. Our study shows that contrary to restoration for visual purposes, a partial restoration scheme, instead of full restoration, should be used for a better unmixing performance. Also, the sampling aliasing, which is an artifact and should be suppressed in traditional restoration application, is actually a signal component which needs to be restored for unmixing. Under fair SNR conditions (> 30 dB), the proposed restoration scheme can reduce the total unmixing error up to 40...|$|E
