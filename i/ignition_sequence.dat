The Lockheed Martin-designed LAM was flown without a Laser Radar (LADAR) seeker or warhead. A solid rocket motor vertically launched the , 100-pound missile from a closed breach canister mounted in a Lockheed Martin prototype launcher.

50|$|During {{the main}} engine <b>ignition</b> <b>sequence,</b> a gold pin used to plug an {{oxidizer}} {{post in the}} Space Shuttle's third (right) engine came loose and was violently ejected, striking the engine nozzle's inner surface and tearing open three cooling tubes containing hydrogen. These ruptures resulted in a leak downstream of the main combustion chamber. This anomalous event and the automatic response to the leak by the right engine's controller did not violate any launch commit criteria and liftoff proceeded normally. However, approximately 5 seconds after liftoff, an electrical short disabled the center engine's primary digital control unit, DCU-A, and the right engine's backup unit, DCU-B. The center and right engines continued to operate on their remaining DCUs {{for the rest of}} powered flight to orbit. The redundant set of DCUs in each engine controller saved Columbia and her crew from potential catastrophe, as shutdown of two engines at that point in the flight would have resulted in a very risky contingency abort with no guarantee of success. The electrical short was later discovered to have been caused by poorly routed wiring, which had rubbed on an exposed screw head. This wiring issue led to a program-wide inspection of the wiring in all orbiters.Because of the leak in the right engine, its controller sensed a decrease in power or thrust—measured indirectly as main combustion chamber pressure—since the leaking hydrogen was not being burned in the SSME's two pre-burners or the main combustion chamber. To bring the engine back up to the commanded thrust level, the controller opened the oxidizer values a bit more than normal. The hydrogen leak and increased oxidizer consumption resulted in the right engine deviating from the desired oxygen/hydrogen mixing ratio of 6.03 and running hotter than normal due to the mixture being closer to the stoichiometric ratio of 8:1. The increased oxidizer consumption during ascent resulted in a premature shutdown of all three engines {{near the end of the}} projected burn due to low liquid-oxygen level sensed in the External Tank. Though the premature shutdown resulted in a velocity 15 ft/s lower than targeted, the vehicle safely achieved its intended orbit and completed the mission as planned. This incident brought on a maintenance practice change that required damaged oxidizer posts to be removed and replaced as opposed to being intentionally plugged, as was the practice beforehand.|$|E

The CIK device is simply an empty register which can be supplied with its unique sequence from the randomizer function of the parent machine itself.

The effect of this procedure is to provide high protection against the covert compromise of the CIK wherein a thief acquires the device, copies it, and replaces it unknown to its owner.

40|$|Ignition and {{altitude}} reignition {{are critical}} issues for aeronautical combustion chambers. The success of ignition depends on multiple factors, from {{the characteristics of}} the igniter to the spray droplet size or the level of turbulence at the ignition site. Finding the optimal location of the igniter or the potential of ignition success of a given energy source at a given location are therefore parameters of primary importance in the design of combustion chambers. The purpose of this thesis is to study forced ignition of aeronautical combustion chambers. To do so, Large Eddy Simulations (LES) of two-phase reacting flows are performed and analyzed. First, the equations of the Eulerian formalism used to describe the dispersed phase are presented. To validate the successive LES, experimental data from the MERCATO bench installed at ONERA Fauga-Mauzac are used. It allows to validate the two-phase evaporating flow LES methodology and models prior to its use to other flow conditions. The statistically stationary two-phase flow reacting case is then compared to available data to evaluate the model in reacting conditions. This case is more deeply studied through the analysis of {{the characteristics of the}} flame. This last one appears to experience very different combustion regimes. It is also seen that the determination of the most appropriate methodology to compute two-phase flow flame is not obvious. Furthermore, two different methodologies may both agree with the data and still have different burning modes. The ability of the LES to correctly compute burning two-phase flow being validated, LES of the transient ignition phenomena are performed. The experimentally observed sensitivity of ignition to initial conditions, i. e. to sparking time, is recovered with LES. The analysis highlights the major role played by the spray dispersion {{in the development of the}} initial flame kernel. The use of LES to compute <b>ignition</b> <b>sequences</b> provides a lot of information about the ignition phenomena, however from an industrial point of view, it does not give an optimal result, unless all locations are tested, which brings the CPU cost to unreasonable values. Alternatives are hence needed and are the objective of the last part of this work. It is proposed to derive a local ignition criterion, giving the probability of ignition from the knowledge of the unsteady non-reacting two-phase (air and fuel) flow. This model is based on criteria for the phases of a successful ignition process, from the first kernel formation to the flame propagation towards the injector. Then, comparisons with experimental data on aeronautical chambers are done and show good agreement, indicating that the proposed ignition criterion, coupled to a Large Eddy Simulation of the stationary evaporating two-phase non-reacting flow, can be used to optimize the igniter location and power...|$|R

The objective is to investigate whether or not slip surfaces are formed which would prevent the entrainment of oxygen and, therefore, the initiation of combustion reactions in the intermediate flow region. In addition, local temperature histories are measured in this flow region during the discharge of the rifle into air, nitrogen, and oxygen using specially designed, intrusive temperature gauges. Here, {{the objective is to}} examine whether or not oxygen is entrained and includes combustion processes in the intermediate flash region.

40|$|Abstract — The paper proposes {{the use of}} a dsPIC 30 F 2010 for {{implementing}} the <b>ignition</b> <b>sequence,</b> a double loop control and selecting the operation modes of a low frequency square wave (LFSW) electronic ballast for two-stage HID lamps. The first stage is the power factor correction (PFC) stage, and the second is a single full-bridge (FB) inverter with LC filter. The latter stage performs function of a resonant circuit for lamp ignition and a current controlled low frequency square wave inverter for normal operation. Ignition is achieved at the resonant frequency of the LC filter when the FB converter is working as a resonant inverter. After ignition the converter operates as a LFSW inverter by controlling the FB to act alternately as a Buck converter supplying positive or negative current. While ignition occurs at the LC filter resonance (fo= 25 kHz), the Buck converter switching frequency (fsw= 200 kHz) is selected significantly higher to attenuate high frequency harmonics and avoid exciting acoustic resonance. Lamp stability is achieved by controlling the inductor current of the LC filter, and power mode control is achieved adjusting average current supplied by the PFC stage. The microcontroller selects the different operation modes of the FB converter according to the lamp requirements. I...|$|E
