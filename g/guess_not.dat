500|$|... "Harlem Shake" [...] {{begins with}} a sample of a voice {{shouting}} [...] "con los terroristas", a Spanish phrase which translates to [...] "with the terrorists" [...] in English. Although listeners assumed it was a female voice, the sample was taken from the 2006 reggaeton song [...] "Maldades" [...] by Héctor Delgado, who often used the line as a refrain on his other songs. In 2010, the recorded phrase was used by Philadelphia disc jockeys Skinny Friedman and DJ Apt One on their remix of Gregor Salto's dance track [...] "Con Alegría". Baauer said he found the vocal sample from an unidentified source on the Internet. The sampled voice is followed by building synths and snares, and a syncopated sub-bass sound before another voice commands listeners to [...] "do the Harlem shake". The line was sampled from Plastic Little's 2001 hip hop song [...] "Miller Time", which Baauer sampled after having a friend play it for him and [...] " [...] stuck in my head for a while". Plastic Little member Jayson Musson said his line was inspired by a fist-fight that he ended by performing the harlem shake dance move: [...] "This was my first fight and I didn’t know how to properly 'end' a fight, so I just smiled at him and did the Harlem shake, blood gushing from glass cuts on my face. The other kid, I <b>guess</b> <b>not</b> wanting to fight anymore, or maybe not wanting to fight someone who just danced at him, got on his skateboard and took off without his shoes." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ronsard was the {{acknowledged}} {{chief of}} the Pléiade and its most voluminous poet. He was probably also its best, though a few isolated pieces of Belleau excel him in airy lightness of touch. Several sonnets of Du Bellay exhibit the melancholy of the Renaissance more perfectly than anything of his, and the finest passages of the Tragiques and the Divine Sep'Maine surpass his work {{in command of the}} alexandrine and in power of turning it to the purposes of satirical invective and descriptive narration. But that work is very extensive (we possess at a rough <b>guess</b> <b>not</b> much short of a hundred thousand lines of his), and it is extraordinarily varied in form. He did not introduce the sonnet into France, but he practised it soon after its introduction and with skill - the famous [...] "Quand vous serez bien vieille" [...] being one of the acknowledged gems of French literature.|$|E

6000|$|I saw poor Ellen {{kneeling}} still, [...] So pale! I <b>guessed</b> <b>not</b> why: [...] 325 [...] When {{she stood}} up, there plainly was [...] A trouble in her eye.|$|R
60|$|Nor would I ever kiss her, after I {{had seen}} her lips pressed by the snake's, though she {{sometimes}} coaxed me, and grew pettish and vexed when I would not; but she <b>guessed</b> <b>not</b> my reason.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>not,</b> pap. I'd like to {{know what}} you think you're a-doin' sendin' me 'way back there. Boomtown's good enough fer me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>not.</b> He {{is reading}} about the prize-fight, and when Churchley gets on to {{anything}} of that kind he gets completely absorbed." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{housekeeper}} {{shook her}} head. [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>not.</b> It's a league round by the bridge, and you couldn't find the other {{trail in the}} dark." ...|$|E
6000|$|Bethlen. [...] Lady, 'twas my wont [...] To roam {{there in}} my {{childhood}} oft alone [...] And mutter to myself the name of father. [...] 335 [...] For still Bathory (why, till now I <b>guessed</b> <b>not)</b> [...] Would never hear it from my lips, but sighing [...] Gazed upward. Yet of late an idle terror---- ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{spite of}} agitation, I managed to summon {{up one of}} my sweetest smiles--a smile that ere now had melted the hearts of {{rickshaw}} coolies and of French douaniers. He thawed before it visibly. 'Time was important to us,' I said--oh, he <b>guessed</b> <b>not</b> how important; 'and besides, you know, it is so good for the company!' ...|$|R
60|$|No wonder Avonmouth was astonished, {{and that}} <b>guesses</b> were <b>not</b> {{confined}} to Mackarel Lane.|$|R
6000|$|... "Give {{them up to}} a rogue like that! I should <b>guess</b> <b>not!</b> It will be {{some little}} time before he tries again. Well done, little mother!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] Devine {{answered}} reluctantly; [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>not.</b> I've {{been over}} twice this week, and Hester has {{enough to do}} without extra cooking for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I <b>guess</b> <b>not,</b> Andy. Why, look, {{there is}} a regular wagon road. If other wagons can pass along here, I fancy we can do so, too." ...|$|E
60|$|It was in {{her eyes}} that he read her meaning, and yet could not credit it. He was abashed--ashamed; nay, he could not define the feeling in his breast. He knew that what he read was the true {{interpretation}} of her speech, for in some manner--he <b>guessed</b> <b>not</b> how--she had begun to idealize him, {{to feel that the}} touch of these things defiled him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> I'm <b>not</b> {{fitted to}} be a pioneer artist," [...] Parker confessed, and the hearty {{agreement}} {{he met with}} quite disconcerted him.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, I <b>guess</b> <b>not!</b> He can't, 'cause I've {{gone into}} {{partners}} with him, an' there won't be any funny business. We're goin' to take Jip for a clerk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>not.</b> He {{was near}} the baggage room when I saw him. Then Mr. Woodward came up to see about a trunk, and the tramp made right off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have limned a frightful picture, reverend sir," [...] said Roland Graeme; [...] "yet I <b>guess</b> <b>not</b> {{whom you}} would charge {{with the purpose}} of effecting a change so horrible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know well}} enough," [...] she {{answered}} defiantly. [...] "I <b>guess</b> you're <b>not</b> proposing {{to give me}} a supper out of charity, are you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fear you run {{very fast}} to conclusions, Mr. Fox," [...] I answered, laughing, tho' I thought his <b>guess</b> was <b>not</b> far from wrong.|$|R
6000|$|The {{storekeeper}} {{glanced at}} a stout deal box. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I <b>guess</b> there's <b>not</b> {{much more than}} twelve pounds in there, and it's for the major--tea and coffee and some special fixings from Vancouver. If he don't get it, he and Miss Coulthurst will come right down to drinking water. The freighter couldn't {{take more than a}} half-case of whisky in for him last time, and I <b>guess</b> that's <b>not</b> going to last the Gold Commissioner long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>not.</b> All of 'em {{have got}} to {{drinking}} again. Say, captain, let {{me out of this}} fix and I'll never go against you again, never," [...] continued Wilbur, earnestly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>not.</b> Come, we've {{got them}} on the run again." [...] And away the pair went, into the cane-brake, through which the rebels were {{crashing}} like so many wild cattle.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>not.</b> Don't care if I do. Serve me right, selfish pig, {{to let you}} go, {{and stay}} writing rubbish myself!" [...] muttered Jo, as she went to consult Hannah.|$|E
6000|$|... "Cash required!" [...] {{said the}} newcomer, with a grin. [...] "Well, I <b>guess</b> that's <b>not</b> astonishing. It {{would be a}} blame foolish man who gave you credit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Dry up, Papa,” said Case. “’Tain’t you that’s {{to marry}} her. I <b>guess</b> you’re <b>not</b> her godfather and godmother. I guess Mr. Wiltshire’s going to please himself.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Hopkins, coolly, [...] "I <b>guess</b> you're <b>not</b> {{going to}} do it long. You know the maxim about fooling the people. It can't be done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>guess</b> <b>not.</b> Of course I can't tell. Doc Linyard {{may want}} me to do {{something}} for him--write a letter or so, and that all takes time. I'll be back by nine, I guess." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he replied, [...] "I <b>guess</b> <b>not.</b> I'm {{making good}} wages here. So long as I can keep from riling Cassidy they're sure." [...] Then {{he grinned at}} Weston. [...] "It's your call." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I <b>guess</b> <b>not.</b> I {{was afraid}} to try, anyway, for fear he'd think I meant it and just go. I suppose I'm a poor-spirited creature, but that is how I feel. And I can't help it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Miss Desborough impetuously, [...] "what's {{the matter}} with that inn--the Red Lion? We can get a {{sandwich}} there, I <b>guess.</b> I'm <b>not</b> VERY hungry." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Married? I {{never thought}} of that. But no, I <b>guess</b> he's <b>not.</b> He'd have {{mentioned}} it. He's not the sort to hush up a thing like that. I--" ...|$|R
