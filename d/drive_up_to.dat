25|$|Beginning a two-game West Coast swing, the Patriots {{faced the}} Seahawks in Seattle {{for the first}} time since 1993. The Patriots {{received}} the opening kickoff but were later forced to punt. Starting from their own 13-yard line, the Seahawks went 87 yards on 13 plays and took the lead on a 14-yard touchdown catch by former Patriots wide receiver Deion Branch from quarterback Seneca Wallace, starting in place of Matt Hasselbeck. A 20-yard third down catch by Welker put the Patriots into Seahawks territory on their next drive, which eventually ended in a 50-yard Gostkowski field goal that cut the Seahawks' lead to 7–3. Early in the second quarter, the Seahawks moved to the Patriots' 21-yard line on a 25-yard catch by tight end John Carlson; two plays later, Carlson caught a 10-yard touchdown pass from Wallace to extend the Seahaks' lead to 14–3. Hobbs returned the ensuing kickoff 55 yards to set the Patriots' next <b>drive</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> begin from the Seahawks' 43-yard line. Running back LaMont Jordan, playing in his first game for the Patriots since Week 5 due to an injury, fumbled a second down run but recovered his own fumble; a Cassel ran for a first down on the next play to extend the drive. Two plays later, a defensive pass interference penalty on Seahawks cornerback Marcus Trufant on a pass intended for Moss gave the Patriots a first down from the Seahawks' 2-yard line. Watson then caught a 2-yard touchdown pass from Cassel to cut the Seahawks' lead to 14–10, but his post-touchdown celebration involved using the ball as a prop, prompting a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. The Seahawks began their next drive from their own 40-yard line but were forced to punt, giving the Patriots the ball at their own 10-yard line. The Patriots managed to reach midfield, but a third down sack of Cassel by defensive end Baraka Atkins led to a Patriots punt. The Seahawks then went three-and-out, giving the Patriots the ball to end the first half.|$|E
500|$|As a young man, Cagney became {{interested}} in farming – sparked by a soil conservation lecture he had attended – {{to the extent that}} during his first walkout from Warner Bros., he helped to found a [...] farm in Martha's Vineyard. Cagney loved that no concrete roads surrounded the property, only dirt tracks. The house was rather run-down and ramshackle, and Billie was initially reluctant to move in, but soon came to love the place, as well. After being inundated by movie fans, Cagney sent out a rumor that he had hired a gunman for security.

500|$|Pluton was {{designed}} to carry 220 [...] Sautter-Harlé mines, but had space for 30 extra, {{for a total of}} 250. They were carried on the first deck, or mine deck, using a system of four rails along the sides of the ship and moved via chain-drives. Each pair of rails converged on a turntable at the forward end of the rails and a transverse spur connected the two turntables. The spur facilitated loading mines {{from one side of the}} ship and allowed mines to be moved to each of the rails. The rails ended in four ramps at the stern of the ship that sloped down at a 30° angle to minimize the shock of impact when the mines were released from the chain <b>drive.</b> <b>Up</b> <b>to</b> 270 of the smaller Bréguet B4 mines could be carried.|$|E

They would visit the Blackpool Tower Circus and see artists such as Dickie Valentine, Arthur Askey, Max Bygraves and Joe Loss, with Parkes recalling that Lennon particularly liked George Formby. After Parkes's family moved to Scotland, the three cousins often spent their school holidays together there. Parkes recalled, [...] "John, cousin Leila and I were very close. From Edinburgh we would <b>drive</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the family croft at Durness, which was from about the time John was nine years old until he was about 16."

500|$|Debbie Cook {{left the}} Hole in May 2007 after {{spending}} seven weeks there, {{when she was}} sent back to Clearwater, Florida to organize a major public event involving Miscavige. According to Cook, she was driven to downtown Clearwater by another staff member, along with her husband, to eat at the Church's dining hall. The couple took the opportunity to escape Scientology when the staff member went inside to get breakfast; Cook jumped into the driver's seat, drove with her husband to the nearest car rental outlet and hired a car to <b>drive</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> her father's house in North Carolina. Before they got there, they were intercepted by Church officials and ordered to return to Clearwater. She spent three weeks under guard, at one point writing in a letter to her mother that if she was not released she [...] "would take whatever steps necessary, like slitting my wrists", before finally signing a severance agreement.

2500|$|Co-op City is on {{the site}} of Freedomland, a former {{amusement}} park which closed in 1964. Prior to housing that theme park, the land north of the Hutchinson River Parkway was a large area known by residents as [...] "the dump". By the '50s, most of the land {{on the north side of}} the Hutchinson River was flat land used for recreation; for example, model airplane flying meets were held there. It was possible to <b>drive</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Hutchinson River and walk along several paths through the reeds and swim in the Hutchinson River. The land to the south of the Hutchinson River (Section 5 of Co-op City) was unspoiled swamp land from the '50s up through the time Co-op City was constructed. A tidal estuary reached from the Hutchinson River at the New Haven Railroad along a route just north of Hunter and Boller Avenue to pass under the Hutchinson River Parkway. The estuary was the site of boat yards and canoe rental sites during the 1950s. A well-known restaurant at that site was Gus's Barge, operated by Gus and Francis Erickson. Gus's Barge was a restaurant and a night club featuring jazz combos and other forms of live music. The Ericksons also operated a boat yard that not only rented slips but specialized in refurbishing wooden boats, primarily motor boats made from teak and mahogany. The Ericksons sold their property in 196162.|$|E
