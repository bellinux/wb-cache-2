500|$|Late in life, when <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> {{his years}} acting in Adler and Goldfaden's companies, Adler {{saw it as}} merely the [...] "childhood" [...] of his career. He {{describes}} his thoughts {{toward the end of}} this period, [...] "For three years I had wandered in the cave of the Witch in the clown's rags of Shmendrick and what did I really know of my trade?... If someday I return to the Yiddish theater, let me at least not be so ignorant." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the journey}} back, Nghĩa gave {{his account of}} the assassinations to {{military}} headquarters: “As we rode back to the Joint General Staff headquarters, Diệm sat silently, but Nhu and the captain [...] began to insult each other. I don’t know who started it. The name-calling grew passionate. The captain had hated Nhu before. Now he was charged with emotion.” When the convoy reached a train crossing, Nghĩa said that Nhung “lunged at Nhu with a bayonet and stabbed him again and again, maybe fifteen or twenty times. Still in a rage, he turned to Diệm, took out his revolver and shot him in the head. Then <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> Nhu, who was lying on the floor, twitching. He put a bullet into his head too. Neither Diệm nor Nhu ever defended themselves. Their hands were tied.” ...|$|E

[...] According to historian Howard Jones, the fact [...] "that the killings failed to make the brothers into martyrs constituted a vivid testimonial to the depth of popular hatred they had aroused." [...] Some months later, Minh reportedly confided to an American source that [...] "We had no alternative. They had to be killed. Diệm could not be allowed to live because he was too much respected among simple, gullible people in the countryside, especially the Catholics and the refugees. We had to kill Nhu because he was so widely feared—and he had created organizations that were the arms of his personal power." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Suddenly, I {{heard the}} clatter of Leycester's machine gun above {{the roar of the}} engine. I looked round to see what he was {{shooting}} at, and nearly had a heart attack. Slanting down from above, getting nicely into position thirty yards behind my tail, was an Albatros. [...] "I immediately heaved the old A-W round in a split-arse turn, tighter I think than I had ever turned before. I felt a flash of panic as I lost sight of the Hun, but Leycester must have been able to see him all right as he kept on firing. My sudden turn had done the trick. The Albatros overshot and suddenly appeared right in front of me. Because of the relative motion of our two aircraft, he seemed to hang motionless, suspended in mid-air. I could see the pilot's face as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>back</b> <b>at</b> me. I sent a two-second burst of Vickers (machine gun) fire into him. His aircraft seemed to flutter, then slid out of sight below my starboard wing. I was pretty certain that I had hit his petrol tank. Behind me, Leycester was still blazing away. He was using tracer (incendiary bullets), and it may have been one of his bullets that ignited the petrol pouring from the Hun's ruptured tank. When I caught sight of the Albatros again, it was burning like a torch and side-slipping towards the ground, trailing a streamer of smoke. For an instant I saw the German pilot, looking down {{over the side of the}} cockpit. Then the smoke and flames enveloped him." ...|$|E
