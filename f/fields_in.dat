5|$|Many of the representations, both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional, are {{important}} in theoretical physics. Representations appear {{in the description of}} <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> classical field theory, most importantly the electromagnetic field, and of particles in relativistic quantum mechanics, as well as of both particles and quantum <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> quantum field theory and of various objects in string theory and beyond. The representation theory also provides the theoretical ground for the concept of spin. The theory enters into general relativity in the sense that in small enough regions of spacetime, physics is that of special relativity.|$|E

50|$|Oil {{production}} in the Los Angeles Basin started {{with the discovery of}} the Brea-Olinda Oil <b>Field</b> <b>in</b> 1880, and continued with the development of the Los Angeles City Oil <b>Field</b> <b>in</b> 1893, the Beverly Hills Oil <b>Field</b> <b>in</b> 1900, the Salt Lake Oil <b>Field</b> <b>in</b> 1902, and many others. The discovery of the Long Beach Oil <b>Field</b> <b>in</b> 1921, which proved to be the world's richest in production per-acre of the time, increased the importance of the Los Angeles Basin as a worldwide oil producer. This increased again with the discovery of the Wilmington Oil <b>Field</b> <b>in</b> 1932, and the development of the Port of Los Angeles as a means of shipping crude oil overseas.|$|R

5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} from various {{sites on the}} Iberian peninsula suggest the domestication {{of plants and animals}} between 6,000 and 4,500 BC.

The horse was domesticated in the Pontic steppe around 4,000 BC. In Siberia, Cannabis was in use in China in Neolithic times and may have been domesticated there; it was in use both as a fibre for ropemaking and as a medicine in Ancient Egypt by about 2,350 BC.|$|E
5|$|As the air {{campaign}} continued, the Coalition's expectations of an Iraqi offensive decreased. As a result, the United States redeployed the XVIII Airborne Corps and the VII Corps 480kilometers (300mi) to the west.

5|$|Bryant and Milam were {{questioned}} by Leflore County sheriff George Smith.

Word got out that Till was missing, and soon Medgar Evers, Mississippi state field secretary for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and Amzie Moore, head of the Bolivar County chapter, became involved.

5|$|Burne-Jones's first sketch in oils {{dates from}} this same year, 1856, and during 1857 he made for Bradfield College {{the first of}} what was to be an immense series of {{cartoons}} for stained glass. In 1858 he decorated a cabinet with the Prioress's Tale from Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, his first direct illustration of the work of a poet whom he especially loved and who inspired him with endless subjects. Thus early, therefore, we see the artist busy in all the various <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> which he was to labour.|$|E

5|$|Diamond {{production}} of primary deposits (kimberlites and lamproites) only {{started in the}} 1870s after {{the discovery of the}} Diamond <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> South Africa. Production has increased over time and now an accumulated total of 4.5billion carats have been mined since that date. About 20% of that amount has been mined in the last 5 years alone, and during the last ten years 9 new mines have started production while 4 more are waiting to be opened soon. Most of these mines are located in Canada, Zimbabwe, Angola, and one in Russia.|$|E

A large expansion program was launched in 1939 to train four new pursuit groups at Selfridge for eventual assignment to other GHQ fields. Many of the temporary frame buildings still in use today were built at that time, when a $13.5 million construction program was started at Selfridge.|$|R

5|$|Dr. Mario {{offers a}} {{multiplayer}} gaming mode {{in which two}} players compete {{against each other in}} separate playing <b>fields.</b> <b>In</b> this mode, the player's goal is to clear their own playing field of viruses before the other player does. Eliminating multiple viruses or initiating chain reactions can cause additional capsules to fall onto the opponent's playing field. A player wins a single game upon eliminating all the viruses or if the other playing field fills up. The first player to win three games wins overall.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of playing <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> the valleys, many rugby teams would share grounds, travel every week to away grounds or even play on {{inappropriate}} (e.g. sloping) pitches. The valley clubs also had no clubhouses, with most teams meeting, and changing, in the closest local public house. Many more clubs, built around colliery and pub teams, appeared and disbanded but many of the clubs survive to this day.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Johnson {{was one of}} {{the first}} four flying {{officers}} of the Eighth Air Force, and served on it staff during its formative period at Savannah, Georgia. In 1943, he assumed command of the 44th Bombardment Group, which flew the Consolidated B-24 Liberator. Johnson led the attack on the German naval installations at Kiel in May 1943 and the attack on the Ploesti oil <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> August 1943, for which the 44th Bombardment Group received Distinguished Unit Citations. He commanded the 14th Combat Bombardment Wing from September 1943 until May 1945.|$|E

The multiplication and absorption electric fields vary with the bias voltage on the device. As shown in Fig.  12 c, d, when the electric <b>field</b> <b>in</b> the absorption layer reaches the tunneling threshold value, the avalanche breakdown electric <b>field</b> <b>in</b> the multiplication gradually decreases. Moreover, when the absorption field exceeds the tunneling threshold, the avalanche breakdown electric <b>field</b> <b>in</b> the multiplication layer plummets. Furthermore, the absorption field slope increases when the electric <b>field</b> <b>in</b> the absorption layer exceeds the tunneling threshold.|$|R

25|$|The first {{production}} P-36As {{were delivered}} to the 20th Pursuit Group at Barksdale <b>Field</b> <b>in</b> Louisiana in April 1938. The aircraft's service history was marred by numerous teething problems with the engine exhaust, skin buckling over landing gear, and weak points in the airframe, severely restricting the performance envelope. By the time these issues were resolved, the P-36 was considered obsolete and was relegated to training units and overseas detachments at Albrook <b>Field</b> <b>in</b> the Panama Canal Zone, Elmendorf <b>Field</b> <b>in</b> Alaska, and Wheeler <b>Field</b> <b>in</b> Hawaii.|$|R
5|$|Impermeable plasma {{is a type}} {{of thermal}} plasma which acts like an {{impermeable}} solid with respect to gas or cold plasma and can be physically pushed. Interaction of cold gas and thermal plasma was briefly studied by a group led by Hannes Alfvén in 1960s and 1970s for its possible applications in insulation of fusion plasma from the reactor walls. However, later {{it was found that the}} external magnetic <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> this configuration could induce kink instabilities in the plasma and subsequently lead to an unexpectedly high heat loss to the walls.|$|E
5|$|In late December 2014, NASA's MAVEN {{spacecraft}} detected {{evidence of}} widespread auroras in Mars's northern hemisphere and descended to approximately 20–30 degrees North latitude of Mars's equator. The particles causing the aurora penetrated into the Martian atmosphere, creating auroras below 100km above the surface, Earth's auroras range from 100km to 500km above the surface. Magnetic <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> {{the solar wind}} drape over Mars, into the atmosphere, and the charged particles follow the solar wind magnetic field lines into the atmosphere, causing auroras to occur outside the magnetic umbrellas.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, most helium is {{extracted}} from natural gas of the Hugoton and nearby gas <b>fields</b> <b>in</b> Kansas, Oklahoma, and the Panhandle Field in Texas.
