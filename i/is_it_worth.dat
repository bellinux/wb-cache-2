2500|$|In September 2006, {{emergency}} contraception expert Anna Glasier wrote a BMJ editorial entitled [...] "Emergency Contraception. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>worth</b> all the fuss?" [...] that said in closing: [...] "So is {{emergency contraception}} worth the fuss? If {{you are a}} woman who has had unprotected sex then of course it is, because emergency contraception will prevent pregnancy in some women some of the time—and if you don’t want to get pregnant anything is better than nothing. If you are the CMAJ’s editor or FDA commissioner then yes, because scientific freedom is worth the fight. If you are looking for an intervention that will reduce abortion rates, emergency contraception may not be the solution, and perhaps you should concentrate most on encouraging people to use contraception before or during sex, not after it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 221, after Sun Quan {{received}} the nominal vassal title [...] "King of Wu" [...] (吳王) from the Wei emperor Cao Pi, he appointed Liu Ji as Grand Prefect of Agriculture (大農令). He threw a feast to celebrate with his subjects. During the feast, Yu Fan, an official under Sun Quan, showed disrespect towards his lord. When an enraged Sun Quan drew {{his sword and}} wanted to kill Yu Fan, Liu Ji stood up, grabbed Sun Quan and pleaded with him to spare Yu Fan. He told Sun Quan, [...] "If Your Majesty kills a good man when you're drunk, even if Yu Fan is in the wrong, who would understand the truth? Your Majesty is famous and respected because you showed acceptance and tolerance towards virtuous and talented people over the years. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>worth</b> ruining your good reputation in just one day?" [...] Sun Quan said, [...] "If Cao Mengde can kill Kong Wenju, why can't I {{do the same to}} Yu Fan?" [...] Liu Ji replied, [...] "Mengde killed virtuous people recklessly, hence he didn't win over people's hearts. Your Majesty promotes moral values and righteousness, and wishes to be compared to Yao and Shun. Why are you comparing yourself to him?" [...] Sun Quan then spared Yu Fan and instructed his men to ignore his orders in the future if he was not sober when he ordered someone to be executed.|$|E

Yu Fan immediately sat up as soon as Sun Quan walked away. Sun Quan was furious when he saw that and he drew his sword and wanted to kill Yu Fan. His subjects were all shocked and fearful. Only Liu Ji stood up, grabbed Sun Quan, and pleaded with him to spare Yu Fan.
