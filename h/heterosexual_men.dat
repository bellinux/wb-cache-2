5|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that circumcision {{reduces the risk of}} men acquiring HIV infection in areas of the world with high rates of HIV. Evidence among <b>heterosexual</b> <b>men</b> in sub-Saharan Africa shows an absolute decrease in risk of 1.8% which is a relative decrease of between 38percent and 66percent over twoyears, and in this population studies rate it cost effective. Whether it is of benefit in developed countries is undetermined.|$|E
5|$|Circumcision has a {{protective}} effect against {{the risks of}} penile cancer in men, and cervical cancer in the female sexual partners of <b>heterosexual</b> <b>men.</b> Penile cancer is rare, with about 1 new case per 100,000 people per year in developed countries and higher incidence rates per 100,000 in sub-Saharan Africa (for example: 1.6 in Zimbabwe, 2.7 in Uganda and 3.2 in Swaziland). The number of new cases is also high in certain South American countries such as Paraguay and Uruguay at about 4.3 per 100,000. It is least common in Israeli Jews—0.1 per 100,000—related {{in part to the}} very high rate of circumcision of babies.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association listed {{homosexuality}} in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) as {{a mental}} disorder. A large-scale study of homosexuality in 1962 {{was used to}} justify inclusion of the disorder as a supposed pathological hidden fear {{of the opposite sex}} caused by traumatic parent–child relationships. This view was widely influential in the medical profession. In 1956, however, the psychologist Evelyn Hooker performed a study that compared the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with <b>heterosexual</b> <b>men</b> and found no difference. Her study stunned the medical community and made her a hero to many gay men and lesbians, but homosexuality remained in the DSM until 1973.|$|E

5|$|Following the Stonewall riots, lesbian {{themes in}} {{literature}} {{became much more}} diverse and complex, and shifted the focus of lesbianism from erotica for <b>heterosexual</b> <b>men</b> to works written by and for lesbians. Feminist magazines such as The Furies, and Sinister Wisdom replaced The Ladder. Serious writers who used lesbian characters and plots included Rita Mae Brown's Rubyfruit Jungle (1973), which presents a feminist heroine who chooses to be a lesbian. Poet Audre Lorde confronts homophobia and racism in her works, and Cherríe Moraga is credited with being primarily responsible for bringing Latina perspectives to lesbian literature. Further changing values {{are evident in the}} writings of Dorothy Allison, who focuses on child sexual abuse and deliberately provocative lesbian sadomasochism themes.|$|E
5|$|Queer Eye for the Straight Guy debuted during 2003, {{and quickly}} became a {{surprise}} success. The success of the series resulted in merchandising, franchising of the concept internationally, and a woman-oriented spin-off, Queer Eye for the Straight Girl. Queer Eye won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality Program during 2004. The series' name was abbreviated to Queer Eye {{at the beginning of}} its third season to represent the show's change from making over only <b>heterosexual</b> <b>men</b> to including women and homosexual men. Queer Eye ended production during 2006 June and the final ten episodes were broadcast during October 2007. The series ended October 30. During September 2008, the Fine Living Network briefly aired Queer Eye in syndication.|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} and depression {{are the most}} common mental health issues for women. Depression is reported among lesbians at a rate similar to heterosexual women, although generalized anxiety disorder is more likely to appear among lesbian and bisexual women than heterosexual women. Depression is a more significant problem among women who feel they must hide their sexual orientation from friends and family, or experience compounded ethnic or religious discrimination, or endure relationship difficulties with no support system. Men's shaping of women's sexuality has proven to have an effect on how lesbians see their own bodies. Studies have shown that <b>heterosexual</b> <b>men</b> and lesbians have different standards for what they consider attractive in women. Lesbians who view themselves with male standards of female beauty may experience lower self-esteem, eating disorders, and higher incidence of depression. More than half the respondents to a 1994 survey of health issues in lesbians reported they had suicidal thoughts, and 18% had attempted suicide.|$|E

25|$|LeVay's (1991) {{examination}} at autopsy of 18 homosexual men, 1 bisexual man, 16 presumably <b>heterosexual</b> <b>men</b> and 6 presumably heterosexual women {{found that}} the INAH 3 nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus of homosexual men was smaller than that of <b>heterosexual</b> <b>men</b> and closer in size of heterosexual women.

25|$|Summarizing the {{findings}} from these studies, <b>heterosexual</b> <b>men</b> {{seem to be more}} distressed by sexual infidelity than heterosexual women, lesbian women, and gay men (Leeker, 2014). These latter three groups seem more responsible for this difference by reporting similarly higher levels of distress toward emotional infidelity than <b>heterosexual</b> <b>men</b> (Leeker, 2014). However, as previously noted, within-sex analyses reveal that <b>heterosexual</b> <b>men</b> tend to rate emotional infidelity as more distressing than sexual infidelity (Vitelli, 2014).|$|E
25|$|A later study {{determined}} {{that the size of}} the INAH3 of homosexual men was intermediate between that of <b>heterosexual</b> <b>men</b> and heterosexual women. It also {{determined that}} the reason why the INAH3 is smaller in homosexual versus <b>heterosexual</b> <b>men</b> is because homosexual men have a higher neuronal packing density (the number of neurons per cubic millimeter) in the INAH3 than heterosexual men; there is no difference in the number or cross-sectional area of neurons in the INAH3 of homosexual versus <b>heterosexual</b> <b>men.</b> It was also found that there is no effect of HIV infection on the size of INAH3, that is, HIV infection cannot account for the observed difference in INAH3 volume between homosexual and <b>heterosexual</b> <b>men.</b>|$|E
40|$|URL] This paper aims {{to analyze}} how the {{interactional}} positioning of an immigrant university student shapes {{him as a}} <b>heterosexual</b> <b>man</b> in line with a more conservative ‘heterosexual matrix’. This stance emerge in short stories told in a narrative interview situation. This analysis, developed on the Applied Linguistics field, was undertaken based on the three sorting levels of narrative activities listed by Bamberg (2002), as well as making use of Wortham's (2001) analytic tools — reference and predication; metapragmatic descriptors; quotation; indexical evaluation and epistemic modalisation. The study suggests that the university student deconstructs some feminist discourses in his short stories to position himself as a <b>heterosexual</b> <b>man...</b>|$|R

25|$|In 1991, LeVay {{published}} {{a study of}} 41 autopsies on 16 <b>heterosexual</b> <b>men,</b> 19 homosexual men, and 6 heterosexual women that targeted the interstitial nuclei of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH 1, 2, 3, and 4).

However, INAH 3 was larger in <b>heterosexual</b> <b>men</b> in comparison to homosexual men and heterosexual women. This research linked an established sexually dimorphic area of the brain to hetero- and homosexual behavior in men.|$|E

25|$|Commonly, <b>heterosexual</b> <b>men</b> {{reject the}} idea of being {{receptive}} partners during anal sex because they believe it is a feminine act, can make them vulnerable, or contradicts their sexual orientation (for example, that it is indicative that they are gay). The BMJ stated in 1999, however:There are little published data on how many <b>heterosexual</b> <b>men</b> would like their anus to be sexually stimulated in a heterosexual relationship. Anecdotally, it is a substantial number. What data we do have almost all relate to penetrative sexual acts, and the superficial contact of the anal ring with fingers or the tongue is even less well documented but may be assumed to be a common sexual activity for men of all sexual orientations.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} four {{studies suggest that}} {{contamination}} concerns involved in prejudice towards male homosexuals may be expressed in the increased need for physical cleansing after an imagined contact with a homosexual man.

In Study 3, participants evaluated hand and mouth cleansing products as more desirable after imagining using a mobile phone of a homosexual (vs. <b>heterosexual)</b> <b>man.</b> The specific need for cleansing, but not the accessibility of cleansing related words, was more pronounced among political conservatives (Study 4). The results are discussed with reference to the behavioral immune system hypothesis, research on moral disgust, and the embodiment literature...|$|R
25|$|In {{a survey}} of American {{students}} conducted by a magazine in 1996, 24% {{of the people who}} replied claimed to have sexual fantasies involving bondage.
