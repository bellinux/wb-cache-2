I {{describe}} {{the current state}} of our knowledge of the mapping between the <b>initial</b> <b>masses</b> of stars and the compact objects — particularly neutron stars and black holes — that they produce. Most of that knowledge is theoretical in nature, and relies on uncertain assumptions about mass loss through winds, binary mass transfer, and the amount of mass ejected during a supernovae. Observational constraints on the <b>initial</b> <b>masses</b> of stars that produce neutron stars and black holes is scarce. They fall into three general categories: (1) models of the stars that produced the supernova remnants associated with known compact objects, (2) scenarios through with high mass X-ray binaries were produced, and (3) associations between compact objects and coeval clusters of stars for which the minimum masses of stars that have undergone supernovae are known. I focus on the last category as the most promising in the near term.

40|$|Recently, our {{understanding}} of the origin of W UMa-type contact binaries has become clearer. <b>Initial</b> <b>masses</b> of their components were successfully estimated by Yıldız and Doğan using a new method mainly based on observational properties of overluminous secondary components. In this paper, we continue to discuss the results and make computations for age and orbital evolution of these binaries. It is shown that the secondary mass, according to its luminosity, also successfully predicts the observed radius. While the current mass of the primary component is determined by <b>initial</b> <b>masses,</b> the current secondary mass is also a function of initial angular momentum. We develop methods to compute the age of A- and W-subtype W UMa-type contact binaries in terms of <b>initial</b> <b>masses</b> and mass according to the luminosity of the secondaries. Comparisons of our results with the mean ages from kinematic properties of these binaries and data pertaining to contact binaries in open and globular clusters, have increased our confidence on this method. The mean ages of both A- and W-subtype contact binaries are found as 4. 4 and 4. 6 Gyr, respectively. From kinematic studies, these ages are given as 4. 5 and 4. 4 Gyr, respectively. We also compute orbital properties of A-subtype contact binaries {{at the time of the}} first overflow. Initial angular momentum of these binaries is computed by comparing them with the well-known detached binaries. The angular momentum loss rate derived in the present study for the detached phase is in very good agreement with the semi-empirical rates available in the literature. In addition to the limitations on the <b>initial</b> <b>masses</b> of W UMa-type contact binaries, it is shown that the initial period of these binaries is less than about 4. 45 d.

25|$|A blue {{straggler}} is a {{main-sequence star}} {{in an open}} or globular cluster that is more luminous and bluer than stars at the main-sequence turn-off point for the cluster. Blue stragglers were first discovered by Allan Sandage in 1953 while performing photometry of {{the stars in the}} globular cluster M3. Standard theories of stellar evolution hold that the position of a star on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram should be determined almost entirely by the <b>initial</b> <b>mass</b> of the star and its age. In a cluster, stars all formed at approximately the same time, and thus in an H–R diagram for a cluster, all stars should lie along a clearly defined curve set by the age of the cluster, with the positions of individual stars on that curve determined solely by their <b>initial</b> <b>mass.</b> With masses two to three times that {{of the rest of the}} main-sequence cluster stars, blue stragglers seem to be exceptions to this rule. The resolution of this problem is likely related to interactions between two or more stars in the dense confines of the clusters in which blue stragglers are found.|$|E
25|$|Because the core-collapse {{supernova}} mechanism {{itself is}} imperfectly understood, {{it is still}} not known whether it is possible for a star to collapse directly to a black hole without producing a visible supernova, or whether some supernovae initially form unstable neutron stars which then collapse into black holes; the exact relation between the <b>initial</b> <b>mass</b> of the star and the final remnant is also not completely certain.

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} of a young progenitor population for many Type-Ia SNe (SNe-Ia) {{raises the possibility that}} evolved intermediate-mass progenitor stars may be detected in pre-explosion images. NGC 1316, a radio galaxy in the Fornax cluster, is a prolific producer of SNe-Ia, with four detected since 1980. We analyze Hubble Space Telescope (HST) pre-explosion images of the sites of two of the SNe-Ia that exploded in this galaxy, SN 2006 dd (a normal Type-Ia) and SN 2006 mr (likely a subluminous, 1991 bg-like, SN-Ia). Astrometric positions are obtained from optical and near-IR ground-based images of the events. We find no candidate point sources at either location, and set upper limits on the flux in B, V, and I from any such progenitors. We also estimate the amount of extinction that could be present, based on analysis of the surface-brightness inhomogeneities in the HST images themselves. At the distance of NGC 1316, the limits correspond to absolute magnitudes of about - 5. 5, - 5. 4, and - 6. 0 mag in M_B, M_V, and M_I, respectively.

25|$|Once {{they have}} {{exhausted}} their supply of hydrogen through nuclear fusion, medium- to low-mass stars shed their outer layers {{to form a}} planetary nebula and evolve into white dwarfs. While most clusters become dispersed before {{a large proportion of}} their members have reached the white dwarf stage, the number of white dwarfs in open clusters is still generally much lower than would be expected, given the age of the cluster and the expected <b>initial</b> <b>mass</b> distribution of the stars. One possible explanation for the lack of white dwarfs is that when a red giant expels its outer layers to become a planetary nebula, a slight asymmetry in the loss of material could give the star a 'kick' of a few kilometres per second, enough to eject it from the cluster.|$|E
25|$|If Wd1 formed {{stars with}} a typical <b>initial</b> <b>mass</b> {{function}} then the cluster would have originally contained {{a significant number}} of very massive stars, such as those currently observed in the younger Arches cluster. Current estimates of the age of Wd1 are greater than the lifetimes of these stars, and stellar evolution models suggest that there would already have been 50–150 supernovae in Wd1, with a supernova rate of approximately one per 10,000 years over the last million years. However, to date only one definitive supernova remnant has been detected—the Westerlund 1 magnetar—and the lack of other compact objects and high-mass X-ray binaries is puzzling. A number of suggestions have been put forward, including high supernova kick velocities that disrupt binary systems, the formation of slowly accreting (and therefore undetectable) stellar mass black holes, or binary systems in which both objects are now compact objects, but the problem has yet to be resolved.|$|E
25|$|COROT-7b has {{a maximum}} surface {{temperature}} between 1800 and 2600°C (3300 to 4700 degrees Fahrenheit). Due to the high temperature, it may be covered in lava. The composition and density of the planet, though weakly constrained, make COROT-7b a probably rocky planet, like Earth. It could belong to a class of planets that are thought to contain up to 40% water (in the form of ice and/or vapor) in addition to rock. However, {{the fact that it}} formed so close to its parent star may mean that it is depleted of volatiles. A strong possibility exists that the planet's rotation is tidally locked to the orbital period, so that temperatures and geologic conditions {{on the sides of the}} planet facing towards and away from the star may be dramatically different. Theoretical work suggests that CoRoT-7b could be a chthonian planet (the remains of a Neptune-like planet from which much of the <b>initial</b> <b>mass</b> has been removed due to close proximity to its parent star). Other researchers dispute this, and conclude COROT-7b was always a rocky planet and not the eroded core of a gas or ice giant, due to the young age of the star system.|$|E

50|$|There {{appear to}} be two groups of LBVs, one with luminosities above 630,000 times the Sun {{and the other with}} luminosities below 400,000 times the Sun, {{although}} this is disputed in more-recent research. Models have been constructed showing that the lower-luminosity group are post-red-supergiants with <b>initial</b> <b>masses</b> of 30-60 times the Sun, whereas the higher-luminosity group are population-II stars with <b>initial</b> <b>masses</b> 60-90 times the Sun that never develop to red supergiants, although they may become yellow hypergiants. Some models suggest that LBVs are a stage in the evolution of very massive stars required for them to shed excess mass, whereas others require that most of the mass is lost at an earlier cool-supergiant stage. Normal outbursts and the stellar winds in the quiescent state are not sufficient for the required mass loss, but LBVs occasionally produce abnormally large outbursts that can be mistaken for a faint supernova and these may shed the necessary mass. Recent models all agree that the LBV stage occurs after the main-sequence stage and before the hydrogen-depleted Wolf-Rayet stage, and that essentially all LBV stars will eventually explode as a supernova. LBVs apparently can explode directly as a supernova, but probably only a small fraction do. If the star does not lose enough mass {{before the end of the}} LBV stage, it may undergo a particularly powerful supernova created by pair-instability. The latest models of stellar evolution suggest that some single stars with <b>initial</b> <b>masses</b> around 20 times that of the Sun will explode as LBVs as type II-P, type IIb, or type Ib supernovae, whereas binary stars undergo much-more-complex evolution through envelope stripping leading to less predictable outcomes.|$|R
