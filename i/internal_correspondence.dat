The <b>internal</b> <b>correspondence</b> employed encryption, conventional signs, and fake personal and committee names.

25|$|Evidence of a {{substantial}} MoD file {{on the subject}} led to claims of a cover-up; some interpreted this {{as part of a}} larger pattern of information suppression concerning the true nature of unidentified flying objects, by both the United States and British governments. However, when the file was released in 2001 it turned out to consist mostly of <b>internal</b> <b>correspondence</b> and responses to inquiries from the public.

40|$|Liver {{cancer is}} one of the leading causes of death worldwide. One of the reasons for that is the high tumor {{recurrence}} rate. The only way to reduce the recurrence rate is to ensure that all carcinogenic cells are destroyed after intervention. Unfortunately, the information available to assess the outcome of an intervention is limited. In the clinical routine, a pair of pre- and post-operatively gathered computed tomographies (CT) of the abdomen are typically compared to decide whether the patient needs further treatment. However, the post-operative liver will be deformed due to breathing and intervention which will complicate the comparison task by simple inspection of both images. The results presented in this thesis will support the physician during the outcome validation process after minimally invasive interventions and open liver surgeries. Therefore, the physician is provided with qualitative measures and visualizations that support him in the decision making task. The basis of a reliable outcome validation is an accurate non-rigid registration method. This thesis proposes to combine <b>internal</b> <b>correspondences</b> at vessel ramifications and landmarks at the surface of the organ to increase the accuracy of the registration results. The <b>internal</b> <b>correspondences</b> are the result of a novel efficient and fully automatic graph matching method. Landmarks at the surface of the liver are given by a method that detects the organs that are adjacent to it at each surface point. Both types of landmarks are incorporated in a FEM-based registration. The registration method has been tested in 25 pairs of pre- and post-operative clinical CT images achieving an average accuracy of 1. 22 mm and a positive predictive value of 0. 95. In consequence of the accuracy obtained with the proposed methods the physician is able to determine with certainty if the outcome of the intervention was satisfactory. Hence, he can without delay decide to re-treat the patient if needed to remove the remnant tumor. This fast response could at the end reduce the tumor recurrence rate...|$|R
40|$|A {{majority}} of the state-of-the-art combinational verification techniques {{are based on the}} extraction and use of internal equivalences between two circuits. Verification can become difficult if the two circuits have none or very few <b>internal</b> <b>correspondences.</b> In this paper we investigate automatic circuit partitioning as a methodology to make otherwise intractable circuits relatively tractable to the verifier. We show that given any two circuits to be verified, finding the best partitions that minimize the verification runtime is NP-hard. Therefore, we propose efficient heuristics to utilize certain characteristics of typical circuit design styles to find good partitions for the circuits. A key difference between our approach and earlier approaches to circuit partitioning is that ours is fully automated and does not require any prior knowledge of the type of function being implemented by the circuit. Using circuit partitioning we are able to verify several hard industrial circuits that could not be verified otherwise...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{communication}} between speakers with different first languages {{in a business}} setting, referred to as BELF, Business English as a lingua franca. The present paper investigates politeness strategies in BELF e-mail correspondence, and the interplay between them. Politeness strategies {{play an important role}} in e-mail correspondence, and this has been identified through studying formality in greetings and closings, and directness in requests. The dataset consists of 46 naturally-occurring e-mails, which have been grouped into <b>internal</b> or external <b>correspondence</b> to accordingly answer the research question, which aims to investigate whether or not there is a difference in the communicative approach depending on who the receiver is. This has been analysed in terms of the politeness strategies formality and directness, and the results show that the <b>internal</b> and external <b>correspondence</b> are very similar to each other, hence the level of formality and directness rather appears to depend on the sender him/herself. The results furthermore present that greetings are mainly informal, closings mainly formal and requests predominantly direct, for both <b>internal</b> and external <b>correspondence.</b> This would conventionally indicate that the e-mails are impolite; however, in accordance with some recent scholars it has been agreed that, along with the development of e-mails, the requirements for politeness have changed, and the e-mails in the present study are primarily considered polite. ...|$|R
