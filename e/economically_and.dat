5|$|Despite being {{across the}} world from the conflict, the Australian colonies were {{affected}} by the American Civil War both <b>economically</b> <b>and</b> by immigration. The Australian cotton crop became more important to England, which had lost its American sources, and it served as a supply base for Confederate blockade runners. Immigrants from Europe seeking a better life also found Australia preferable to war-torn North America.|$|E
5|$|More broadly, one {{hallmark}} of the 1950s {{was the beginning of}} European integration—a fundamental by-product of the Cold War that Truman and Eisenhower promoted politically, <b>economically,</b> <b>and</b> militarily, but which later administrations viewed ambivalently, fearful that an independent Europe would forge a separate détente with the Soviet Union, which would use this to exacerbate Western disunity.|$|E

5|$|A UNPA {{could be}} created through a {{stand-alone}} treaty.

By 1819, the Crown were receiving regular rent and the street was becoming established. At first, it was called New Street and became a dividing line between Soho, which had declined socially and <b>economically,</b> <b>and</b> the fashionable squares and streets of Mayfair to the west. Carlton House did not last long following completion of the works and was demolished in 1829, to be replaced by Carlton House Terrace, also designed by Nash.|$|E

Carabane has remained one of the calmest areas of Casamance throughout the conflict. Nonetheless, a few small incidents were reported around April 2000.

According to PRC policy, Uyghurs are classified as a National Minority rather than an indigenous group—in other words, they {{are considered to be}} no more indigenous to Xinjiang than the Han, and have no special rights to the land under the law.

5|$|In {{spite of}} these {{failures}} and challenges, Diocletian's reforms fundamentally changed the structure of Roman imperial government and helped stabilize the empire <b>economically</b> <b>and</b> militarily, enabling the empire to remain essentially intact for another 150 years despite being near the brink of collapse in Diocletian's youth. Weakened by illness, Diocletian left the imperial office on 1 May 305, {{and became the first}} Roman emperor to abdicate the position voluntarily. He lived out his retirement in his palace on the Dalmatian coast, tending to his vegetable gardens. His palace eventually became the core of the modern-day city of Split in Croatia.|$|E

Pregnancy results in major changes in a girl's life, physically, emotionally, socially and <b>economically</b> <b>and</b> jeopardises her transition into adulthood. Adolescent pregnancy, more often than not, stems from a girl's lack of choices. or abuse.

The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall. Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.|$|E
