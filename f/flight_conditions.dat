The aircraft cabin simulator is a testbed that was designed for research on aircraft passenger comfort improvement product. The simulator consists of an economy class section, a business class section, a lavatory and a galley.

25|$|Once the quirks and foibles of the B12 are {{understood}} {{it is possible}} to compete effectively with other contemporary two-seaters. However the expected performance gains were only partly realised and the B12 does not rank with the highest performance gliders, as was hoped. One quirk is the B12 'sigh' which can be heard in certain <b>flight</b> <b>conditions,</b> the origin of which remains a mystery. Competition flying is carried out with the call-sign CB and a handicap index of 106 is applied. The aircraft carries registration 'D-7612'.|$|E
25|$|Like the Bf 109, the Fw 190 {{featured}} a fairly small wing planform with relatively high wing loading. This presents a trade-off in performance. An aircraft {{with a smaller}} wing suffers less drag under most <b>flight</b> <b>conditions</b> and therefore flies faster and may have better range. However, it also means the wing generates less lift at lower speeds, making it less maneuverable and also reduces performance in the thinner air at higher altitudes. The wings spanned 9.5m (31ft 2in) and had an area of 15m² (161ft²). The wing was designed using the NACA 23015.3 airfoil at the root and the NACA 23009 airfoil at the tip.|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} {{method has}} been developed using the techniques of Lock and Theodorsen as described by Davidson to design and analyze counter-rotating propellers. The design method develops the optimum propeller geometry by calculating the planform and twist distribution for each propeller disk {{through the use of}} specific inputs of engine shaft horsepower, diameter, and disk spacing. The analysis method calculates the performance of a given counter-rotating propeller system at any <b>flight</b> <b>condition.</b> Using the NACA four-digit airfoil family, the performance of a counter-rotating propeller design for a given <b>flight</b> <b>condition</b> was investigated in the design and analysis mode...|$|R

On 23 June 2010, the first two NH90 TTHs were delivered to the RAFO at Musana Air Base. By July 2012, ten NH90s had been delivered to the RAFO; in Omani service, the NH90 has established an endurance record, flying 700 nautical miles without refueling during a 5-hour 21 minute-long mission.|$|E
25|$|The Norden Mk. XV, {{known as}} the Norden M series in Army service, was a bombsight used by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and the United States Navy during World War II, and the United States Air Force in the Korean and the Vietnam Wars. It was the {{canonical}} tachometric design, a system that allowed it to directly measure the aircraft's ground speed and direction, which older bombsights could only measure inaccurately with lengthy in-flight procedures. The Norden further improved on older designs by using an analog computer that constantly calculated the bomb's impact point based on current <b>flight</b> <b>conditions,</b> and an autopilot that let it react quickly and accurately {{to changes in the}} wind or other effects.|$|E
25|$|In {{parallel}} with the F8U-1s and -2s, the Crusader design team was also working on a larger aircraft with even greater performance, internally designated as the V-401. Although externally similar to the Crusader and sharing with it such design elements as the variable incidence wing, the new fighter was larger and was powered by the Pratt & Whitney J75-P-5A engine generating 29,500lbf (131kN) of afterburning thrust. To deal with Mach2+ <b>flight</b> <b>conditions</b> it was fitted with large vertical ventral fins under the tail which rotated to the horizontal position for landing. To ensure sufficient performance, Vought made provisions for a Rocketdyne XLF-40 liquid-fueled rocket motor with 8,000lbf (35.6kN) of thrust {{in addition to the}} turbojet. Avionics included the AN/AWG-7 fire control computer, AN/APG-74 radar, and AN/ASQ-19 datalink. The system was expected to simultaneously track six and engage two targets.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{transonic}} Limit Cycle Oscillation (LCO) phenomenon from a computational/simulation point of view. A CFD/FE coupled solution {{is applied to}} a 3 D model of a rectangular wing with tip store (referred to as the Goland wing) in transonic flow, in order to study the resulting LCO motions. The aim {{of the study is}} to develop a LCO prediction strategy from in-flight data; {{at this stage of the}} work the data will be obtained from simulations. The effect of varying the thickness of the Goland wing on the LCO onset <b>flight</b> <b>condition</b> is explored. The work then addresses the presence or absence of nonlinearity prior to the onset of LCOs. This is crucial as the presence of any nonlinearity for this type of wing can act as a telltale sign of impending LCOs. The clearance between the nonlinearity onset <b>flight</b> <b>condition</b> and the LCO onset <b>flight</b> <b>condition</b> is quantified for various values of the wing design parameters. It is shown that this clearance can be used in order to develop a useful ‘oncoming LCO’ warning criterion...|$|R

25|$|The crew did not {{recognize}} the indications of stall, and did not correct the situation after takeoff, and – by momentarily retarding the engine power and increasing the pitch angle – brought about a deterioration in the <b>flight</b> <b>condition.</b>|$|R
25|$|The wings have an {{intentional}} twist in their shape which causes the wing roots to stall {{in advance of}} the wingtips, which has the effect of the ailerons being fully effective well after the onset of a primary stall condition. Other unfavourable <b>flight</b> <b>conditions</b> are often guarded against, such as a wing drop, which may only be produced as a consequence of prolonged and excessive elevator application during a steep climbing turn, and can be rectified by the relaxation of back pressure. The control forces across all regimes are well-balanced, which reportedly reduces the frequency to which trimming of the control surfaces may need to be performed. Many of the flight control surfaces, such as the elevators and ailerons, are push-rod actuated, while control of the rudder is achieved via cables. As a measure to protect against instances of over-rotation, a reinforced plastic skid is present underneath the tail unit.|$|E
25|$|Soviet {{documents}} declassified in March 2003 {{showed that}} the KGB had conducted their own investigation of the accident, in addition to one government and two military investigations. The KGB's report dismissed various conspiracy theories, instead indicating that the actions of airbase personnel contributed to the crash. The report states that an air traffic controller provided Gagarin with outdated weather information, and {{that by the time}} of his <b>flight,</b> <b>conditions</b> had deteriorated significantly. Ground crew also left external fuel tanks attached to the aircraft. Gagarin's planned flight activities needed clear weather and no outboard tanks. The investigation concluded that Gagarin's aircraft entered a spin, either due to a bird strike or because of a sudden move to avoid another aircraft. Because of the out-of-date weather report, the crew believed their altitude to be higher than it actually was, and could not react properly to bring the MiG-15 out of its spin.|$|E
25|$|Equivalent {{airspeed}} (EAS) {{is defined}} as the speed at sea level that would produce the same incompressible dynamic pressure as the true airspeed at the altitude at which the vehicle is flying. An aircraft in forward flight is subject to the effects of compressibility. Likewise, the calibrated airspeed {{is a function of the}} compressible impact pressure. EAS, on the other hand, is a measure of airspeed that is a function of incompressible dynamic pressure. Structural analysis is often in terms of incompressible dynamic pressure, so that equivalent airspeed is a useful speed for structural testing. At standard sea level pressure, calibrated airspeed and equivalent airspeed are equal. Up to about 200 knots CAS and 10,000 ft (3,000 m) the difference is negligible, but at higher speeds and altitudes CAS must be corrected for compressibility error to determine EAS. The significance of equivalent airspeed is that, at Mach numbers below the onset of wave drag, all of the aerodynamic forces and moments on an aircraft are proportional to the square of the equivalent airspeed. The equivalent airspeed is closely related to the indicated airspeed shown by the airspeed indicator. Thus, the handling and 'feel' of an aircraft, and the aerodynamic loads upon it, at a given equivalent airspeed, are very nearly constant and equal to those at standard sea level irrespective of the actual <b>flight</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The energy {{approach}} to flight control {{has shown the}} high efficiency. On its basis the rational structure of energy control system at landing approach was created. However, the system with constant coefficients cannot provide acceptable control quality for maneuverable high-speed aircrafts over the whole flight envelope.

With its help the optimum system parameters for the operational area were found. The loop of coefficients adjustment according to <b>flight</b> <b>condition</b> was entered into system.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} identification methods are considered as candidate approaches to undertake online flight flutter testing. Rather than flying the test aircraft to a new <b>flight</b> <b>condition</b> and then performing a data analysis at a constant <b>flight</b> <b>condition,</b> it is shown how it is feasible to track changes in frequencies and damping ratios as the flight speed is increased. It is also possible to provide an updated estimate of the predicted flutter speed, giving the flight engineers added confidence in the margin of safety. Both frequency and time domain methods are evaluated on a simulated 3 DOF aeroelastic system. These preliminary results show that such an approach is feasible although further work is required {{to determine the best}} testing and analysis approach...|$|R
500|$|After World War I, {{aviation}} {{began to}} expand its role into the civilian arena, starting with airmail flights. It soon became apparent that for reliable mail delivery, {{as well as the}} passenger flights which were soon to follow, a solution was required for navigation at night and in poor visibility. In the U.S., a network of lighted beacons, similar to maritime lighthouses, was constructed for the airmail pilots. But the beacons were useful mostly at night and in good weather, while in poor visibility conditions they could not be seen.
