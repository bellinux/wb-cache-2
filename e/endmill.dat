25|$|Thrilling is {{the process}} of {{threading}} and drilling (accomplished in the reverse order) internal threads using a specialized cutting tool on a CNC mill. The cutting tool tip is shaped like a drill or center-cutting <b>endmill,</b> while the body has a thread-shaped form with a countersink cutter form near the shank. The cutter first plunges to drill the hole. Then the thread is circularly interpolated just like the multiple-form cutter described above. This tool drills, chamfers, and threads a hole all in one compact cycle. The advantage is this process eliminates a tool, tool-holder, and tool change. The disadvantage is that the process is limited to hole depth no greater than three times the diameter of the tool.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{handheld}} power routers {{were invented}} in 1915 and were Jet Motor Hand Routers, called Onsruters. The name derives {{from a combination}} of the inventor's last name [...] "Onsrud" [...] and the term [...] "router". The Onsruter married a router plane with an <b>endmill</b> to create the first handheld power router. The idea for the Onsruter started when a rail road company decided they wanted to power the front light on a Steam Locomotive using exhaust steam from the engine. Oscar Onsrud and his son Rudy came up with, and submitted, a design for a jet motor (air turbine) to generate the power for the light, however, they failed to win the contract. A few months later Rudy was talking with a friend about his frustrations making the groove {{in the bottom of a}} cane bottom chair using a router plane. A spark went off in Rudy's head that he could re-purpose the jet motor, which he had spent so much time developing, to run on compressed air and spin a modified <b>endmill</b> and make the routed groove easily. The modified endmills would have to spin at 30,000 RPM, instead of the 3,000 RPM of a milling machine, in order to cut wood and not burn it. These bits also needed a steeper rake and clearance angle to evacuate the chips than needed on a traditional <b>endmill.</b> These new bits became known as router bits or router cutters (UK).|$|E

2500|$|Another {{variant of}} form-milling {{involves}} holding the cutter's axis orthogonally (no canting to the thread's helix angle) and feeding the cutter in a toolpath that will generate the thread. The part {{is usually a}} stationary workpiece, such as a boss on a valve body (in external thread milling) or a hole in a plate or block (in internal thread milling). This type of thread milling uses essentially the same concept as contouring with an <b>endmill</b> or ball-nose mill, but the cutter and toolpath are arranged specifically to define the [...] "contour" [...] of a thread. The toolpath is achieved either using helical interpolation (which is circular interpolation in one plane [...] with simultaneous linear interpolation along a third axis the CNC control model must be one that supports using the third axis) or a simulation of it using extremely small increments of 3-axes linear interpolation (which is not practical to program manually but can be programmed easily with CAD/CAM software). The cutter geometry reflects the thread pitch but not its lead; the lead (thread helix angle) {{is determined by the}} toolpath. Tapered threads can be cut either with a tapered multiple-form cutter that completes the thread in one revolution using helical interpolation, or with a straight or tapered cutter (of single- or multiple-form) whose toolpath is one or more revolutions but cannot use helical interpolation and must use CAD/CAM software to generate a contour-like simulation of helical interpolation.|$|E

50|$|A {{dovetail}} cutter is an <b>endmill</b> whose form leaves behind a dovetail slot, such as often forms {{the ways of}} a machine tool.|$|E
5000|$|Burrs are a rotary analog {{to files}} that cut [...] (hence their {{alternate}} name, rotary files). They {{are also in}} many ways comparable to <b>endmills</b> and to router bits; a distinction is that the latter usually have their toolpath controlled by the machine, whereas burrs are often used [...] However, there is substantial overlap in the use and toolpath control of these various classes of cutters, and in the outcomes accomplished with them. For example, <b>endmills</b> {{can be used in}} routers, and burrs can be used like <b>endmills</b> in milling by CNC or manual machine tools. In fact, burrs (the tools) are often used in CNC machining centers for removing burrs (the small flakes of metal) after a machining process.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{geometry}} of a countersink (cutter) inherently {{can be applied}} to the plunging applications described above (axial feed only) and also to other milling applications (sideways traversal). Therefore, countersinks overlap in form, function, and sometimes name with chamfering <b>endmills</b> (<b>endmills</b> with angled tips). Regardless of the name given to the cutter, the surface being generated may be a conical chamfer (plunging applications) or a beveled corner for the intersection of two planes (traversing applications).|$|R
50|$|Today's {{tool and}} cutter grinder is {{typically}} a CNC machine tool, usually 5 axes, which produces <b>endmills,</b> drills, step tools, etc. which {{are widely used}} in the metal cutting and woodworking industries.|$|R
5000|$|The {{simplest}} CNCs, such as microlathes or manual-to-CNC conversions, {{which use}} nut-and-Acme-screw drives can {{be programmed to}} correct for the total backlash on each axis, so that the machine's control system will automatically move the extra distance required {{to take up the}} slack when it changes directions. This programmatic [...] "backlash compensation" [...] is a cheap solution, but professional grade CNCs use the more expensive backlash-eliminating drives mentioned above. This allows them to do 3D contouring with a ball-nosed <b>endmill,</b> for example, where the <b>endmill</b> travels around in many directions with constant rigidity and without delays.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{example of the}} general cutter {{location}} problem is cutter radius compensation (CRC), in which an <b>endmill</b> (whether square end, ball end, or bull end) must be offset to compensate for its radius.|$|E
50|$|Whereas a hob {{engages the}} work {{much as a}} mating gear would (and cuts the blank {{progressively}} until it reaches final shape), a thread milling cutter operates much like an <b>endmill,</b> traveling around the work in a helical interpolation.|$|E
40|$|Tool failure {{mechanism}} of carbide tool in <b>endmilling</b> {{has been studied}} with regard to carbide grades and cutting edge sharpenability. Carbide tool's properties were varied by changing the chemical compositions and the carbide particle sizes. Machining test were conducted on a milling machine by <b>endmilling</b> plain carbon steel block. Cutting speed was varied from 31. 6 m/min to 56. 7 m/min and feed rate 0. 1 mm/tooth whereas depth of cut was used constantly on the tests. After test runs, the following conclusions were obtained : (1) There {{is a great deal}} of influence in tool failure, when the carbide grades of <b>endmills</b> are changed with the sharpenability of cutting edges. It is found that the sharpenability of cutting edge relate with carbide particle sizes and binder contents. (2) Wear pattern on the tool flank is fine chipping in cutting edges and its chipping process is rapid in the up-endmilling. (3) The difference of the cutting-ability rating of the hot isostatic press treatment tool (N 20 H) and that of the conventional tool (N 20) was not clear...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{fundamental}} investigation for machining error in elastomer <b>endmilling.</b> In the conventional metal machining, cutting force during <b>endmilling</b> {{is one of}} the most important factors to machining error.

5000|$|A {{shell mill}} is any of various milling cutters (typically a face mill or <b>endmill)</b> whose {{construction}} takes a modular form, with the shank (arbor) made {{separately from the}} body of the cutter, which is called a [...] "shell" [...] and attaches to the shank/arbor via any of several standardized joining methods.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer-aided}} manufacturing, the torus is a {{shape that}} is {{commonly associated with}} the <b>endmill</b> cutter.

25|$|Grinders have {{increased}} in size and complexity with advances in time and technology.

50|$|Carbide is more {{expensive}} per unit than other typical tool materials, and it is more brittle, making it susceptible to chipping and breaking. To offset these problems, the carbide cutting tip itself is often {{in the form of}} a small insert for a larger tipped tool whose shank is made of another material, usually carbon tool steel. This gives the benefit of using carbide at the cutting interface without the high cost and brittleness of making the entire tool out of carbide. Most modern face mills use carbide inserts, as well as many lathe tools and <b>endmills.</b> In recent decades, though, solid-carbide <b>endmills</b> have also become more commonly used, wherever the application's characteristics make the pros (such as shorter cycle times) outweigh the cons (mentioned above).|$|R

For this purpose, new recursive least square method (RLSM) was adopted for the on-line system identification and monitoring of a machining process; we can apply these new algorithms in a real process for detection of abnormal chatter.

50|$|Cutting tools: Cutting tools include various {{milling cutters}} such as face mills, shell mills, <b>endmills,</b> and form cutters; various drills, reamers, taps, countersinks, counterbores, and core drills; various turning tools, form tools, and {{threading}} tools; various grinding wheels distinguished by their geometry, bond, grit size, and compound.|$|R
50|$|PCBs may be {{machined}} {{with conventional}} <b>endmills,</b> conical d-bit cutters, and spade mills. D-bits and spade mills are cheap {{and as they}} have a small point allow the traces to be close together. Taylor's equation, Vc Tn = C, can predict tool life for a given surface speed.|$|R
5000|$|Set screws are {{not always}} {{the best way to}} resist the torque of driven shafts. To reduce the chance of {{slipping}} and to increase load capacity, a detent (often called a [...] "flat") may be milled or ground at the part of the shaft where the set screw's point contacts. The detent, however, must be closely aligned with the threaded hole prior to fastening. The operator can often feel the screw push the flat into final alignment as he or she makes the last half- or quarter-turn that tightens the screw. Set screws can successfully hold against heavy-torque applications if the details are right. For example, <b>endmill</b> holders of the solid type typically use large set screws holding against flats to fasten the <b>endmill,</b> and heavy loads are resisted. However, small set screws without flats are prone to spinning and galling if overloaded. The use of keys and keyways instead of, or in combination with, set screws is common for applications requiring high torque resistance or transmission. Splines offer yet more strength.|$|E
50|$|The {{choice between}} {{vertical}} and horizontal spindle orientation in milling machine design usually hinges on the shape and size of a workpiece {{and the number of}} sides of the workpiece that require machining. Work in which the spindle's axial movement is normal to one plane, with an <b>endmill</b> as the cutter, lends itself to a vertical mill, where the operator can stand before the machine and have easy access to the cutting action by looking down upon it. Thus vertical mills are most favored for diesinking work (machining a mould into a block of metal). Heavier and longer workpieces lend themselves to placement on the table of a horizontal mill.|$|E
