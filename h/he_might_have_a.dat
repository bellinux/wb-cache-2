5|$|Nosek's other friend Ondřej Vlach {{testified that}} Nosek's fall {{happened}} in a break {{between the end of}} concert and the encore. Nosek climbed the stage together with another fan as the band members were leaving to go backstage. According to him, Blythe ran into the two fans and pushed them both off. While the other fan was caught by a couple of fans remaining under the stage, Nosek fell directly on the ground. According to Vlach, there were fewer fans in front of the stage due to the break. Vlach further testified that after the fall, Nosek went to sit on a bench, where he was fetched a water bottle. Nosek began vomiting about half an hour after the fall and as his friends realized that he had a bulge {{at the back of his}} head, they called an ambulance for fear <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> concussion. Vlach said that he understood Blythe's gesture in the break as an invitation to the stage.|$|E

25|$|Test flights {{revealed}} problems initially {{believed to}} be tail flutter. During high-speed flight approaching Mach0.68, especially during dives, the aircraft's tail would begin to shake violently and the nose would tuck under, steepening the dive. Once caught in this dive, the fighter would enter a high-speed compressibility stall and the controls would lock up, leaving the pilot {{no option but to}} bail out (if possible) or remain with the aircraft until it got down to denser air, where <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> chance to pull out. During a test flight in May 1941, USAAC Major Signa Gilkey managed to stay with a YP-38 in a compressibility lockup, riding it out until he recovered gradually using elevator trim. Lockheed engineers were very concerned at this limitation but first had to concentrate on filling the current order of aircraft. In late June 1941, the Army Air Corps was renamed the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF), and a total of 65 Lightnings were finished for the service by September 1941 with more on the way for the USAAF, the Royal Air Force (RAF), and the Free French Air Force operating from England.|$|E
25|$|With Lord Fitzwilliam, in Grosvenor Square, for {{the purpose}} of {{discussing}} the subject of a coalition with him, and of endeavouring to prevail on him to speak to Fox—Lord Fitzwilliam's sentiments perfectly right—he said his opposition never had been to the constitution of the country, but to the Government when it acted in a way he thought contrary to the constitution; that, therefore, when that was in danger he ceased to be in opposition. On going over the matter it became evident that the great obstacle would arise from Fox's being too much entangled with Grey, Lambton, and that set of men who had lately separated themselves from the party, in order to form a party of their own, and who publicly professed doctrines and opinions in direct opposition to what he and I considered to be for the good and welfare of the public. That this would indeed be very hard and unreasonable, that for the sake of these very men, who both in their public and private capacity had been as inimical as possible, an arrangement should be broken off so salutary and so advisable. Lord Fitzwilliani and myself agreed on every point; he, however, went beyond me in insisting on the indispensable necessity of Pitt resigning the Treasury for another Cabinet office. He acquiesced in the wisdom of trying to bring Fox to be less attached to these false friends, and said Tom Grenville was the best man to speak to him. Lord Fitzwilliam expressed his dislike to Sheridan, said <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lucrative place, but never could be admitted to one of trust and confidence. On my wishing him not to leave town, he said he could safely trust his conscience with the Duke of Portland, and was at the same time ready to return at the shortest notice.|$|E

Short of money, {{he signed with}} the up-and-coming label Smash Records, asked the label for $1,600 in cash in exchange for recording 16 sides. Smash agreed to the proposal, and Miller performed his first session for the company early in 1964, when he recorded the hits [...] "Dang Me" [...] and [...] "Chug-a-Lug". Both were released as singles, peaking at No.1 and No.3 respectively on country charts; both fared well on the Billboard Hot 100 reaching No.7 and No.9. The songs transformed Miller's career, although the former was penned by Miller in just four minutes. Later that year, he recorded the No.15 hit [...] "Do-Wacka-Do," [...] and soon after, the biggest hit of his career [...] "King of the Road", which topped Country and Adult Contemporary charts while peaking at No.4 on the Billboard 100. It also reached No.1 in the UK Singles Chart for one week in May 1965. The song {{was inspired by a}} sign in Chicago that read [...] "Trailers for Sale or Rent" [...] and a hobo who happened upon Miller at an airport in Boise, but [...] Miller needed months to write the song, which was certified gold in May 1965 after selling a million copies. It won numerous awards and earned a royalty check of $160,000 that summer. [...] Later in the year Miller scored hits with [...] "Engine Engine No.9", [...] "Kansas City Star" [...] (a Top Ten country hit in 1965 about a local television children's show personality who would rather stay in the safety and security of his success in Kansas City than become a bigger star – or risk failure – in Omaha), and [...] "England Swings" [...] (an adult contemporary No.1).

On 5 January 1847 George Spencer received the Passionist habit {{from the hands of}} his old friend Father Dominic Barberi who had brought the Congregation to England in 1841. George received the religious name Father Ignatius of Saint Paul, the name he would be known by ever after. Ignatius threw himself into Passionist life and after making his religious profession in 1848 began preaching sermons throughout Britain and Ireland, always calling for prayers for the conversion of England. [...] In August 1849, Ignatius was preaching in Belgium when he heard of Father Dominic's death, consequently he was now Provincial of the Passionist Congregation in England and Belgium.

2500|$|At last, in 1223, Henry V {{executed}} a deed, {{by which he}} appointed his nephew his successor in {{all that remained of}} the allodial domains of the duchies of Saxony and Bavaria, and also in the private fiefs which he held as an individual {{in other parts of the}} empire. These states, however, constituted so small a portion of the former wealth of his illustrious house, that we should have thought there was scarcely a pretext for either envy or alarm in the breast of his enemy, yet when the Emperor, Frederick II, was made acquainted with the intentions of the Count Palatine, [...] he [...] began [...] to [...] intrigue [...] with [...] his daughters. That <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> pretense for depriving Otto of the succession at his uncle's death, he purchased from Irmgard, the Margravine of Baden and Agnes, the Duchess of Bavaria their claims as the only issue of the Duke of Saxony; and no sooner was the death of Henry announced, than the King of the Romans was dispatched with an imperial force to take possession of the city and territory of Brunswick. But Otto had been regularly acknowledged by the states as their legitimate sovereign and had been received as such by the city and principality. They therefore joined him heartily in repelling this invasion, and the king and his array were compelled to retire, without being able to effect the object which the emperor had in view.|$|E

2500|$|On February 25, 2006, Vargas {{once again}} {{returned}} to the ring to face fellow Southern California boxer Sugar Shane Mosley. [...] In a tightly contested battle, Vargas' left eye became grotesquely swollen and referee Joe Cortez decided to stop the fight in the 10th round to minimize further damage, granting a technical knockout (TKO) victory to Mosley. The reasoning behind the stoppage, explained Nevada State Athletic Commission czar Marc Ratner, was that the referee and the fight doctor deemed that Vargas was unable to defend himself adequately against Mosley's right-hand shots. At {{the time of the}} stoppage, two judges had Mosley winning the fight 86-85. One judge had Vargas winning the fight 86-85. Fightnews.com had the bout scored 86-85 for Mosley. In the post fight press conference, Vargas {{made it clear that he}} would resume his boxing career and stated that a rematch with Mosley should be in order because the match was stopped on a technicality. ESPN boxing expert Dan Rafael wrote: [...] "Vargas is so utterly delusional about what actually happened in his first fight with Mosley that we think <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> concussion. When will he stop lying to himself -- and when will his team stop going along with him?

2500|$|The game's main {{theme is}} morality, {{and it is}} the game in the series with the largest focus on philosophy; Uchikoshi intends to have the player's [...] "way of thinking, values, [...] virtues" [...] shaken {{intensely}} while they play the game. The [...] "dilemma" [...] in the game's title reflects this, as the game asks the player whether choices they make are the right thing to do. Another main theme is identity, and how people try to figure out who they are. This came from Uchikoshi's personal struggles with identity issues: he said that he is [...] "always thinking about who [...] " [...] and that he thinks <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> multifaceted personality; his characters, like him, deal with this issue. Among other major themes are [...] "multiple-probability histories", with the player being able to move between different equally probable histories depending on the choices they have made; and the big effects small coincidences can have, which was reflected in the use of randomizing events. The idea to include randomization came from how Uchikoshi wanted to [...] "spoiler-proof" [...] the game, and felt that FAQ websites that tell players how to beat the game make playthroughs uninteresting. He had always been fascinated by the concept of coincidences, and how actions done in the past lead up [...] "where we are today", so he did a lot of research and reading on the topic to prepare writing the story. The theme of no absolute good or evil came from Buddhist literature Uchikoshi had read, particularly the Zen Buddhist idea of [...] "shiki soku zeku", which he described as [...] "matter is void and form is emptiness". Because of this idea, Uchikoshi tried to give each character [...] "their own sense of personal justice that they believe to be true", resulting in characters with different philosophies who play off each other.|$|E
