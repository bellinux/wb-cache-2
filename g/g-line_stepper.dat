40|$|Tests {{of several}} high {{contrast}} g- and i-line resists furnish data {{with respect to}} the resolution limit, focus and exposure latitudes, thermal stability and Dill parameters. A <b>g-line</b> <b>stepper</b> of NA = 0. 48 and an i-line stepper of NA = 0. 40 were primarily used for exposure, to a minor extent a <b>g-line</b> <b>stepper</b> of NA = 0. 55. The contributions to the focus budget available under production conditions are discussed. SAMPLE simulations extending NA to 0. 60 in the g-line and 0. 50 in the i-line case give latitude trends to be expected in the near future...|$|E
40|$|This project {{involved}} {{the definition of}} the steps necessary to generate a mask or reticle for any of the three exposure tools (te. GCA lox <b>G-line</b> <b>Stepper,</b> Perkin Elmer Scanning Aligners, and Kasper Contact Aligners) used at RIT. Next a working process for creating chrome masks for the Perkin Elmer Scanners was developed. Using the process outlined in this paper 5 micron line widths can be repeatedly obtained...|$|E
40|$|This project {{investigated}} {{the concept of}} a chromeless phase-shifting mask. An optical simulator, SPLAT, was used to predict the aerial image formed for various chromeless phaseshifting patterns. Allied Signal 311 spin on glass was patterned on a quartz plate and imaged using a GCA MANN 4800, lOX, NA=O. 28, <b>G-line</b> <b>stepper</b> to demonstrate the concept. Simulations showed and experimental results confirmed that a dark field could be produced with checkerboard patterns below 0. 4 Lambda/NA. Using 25 % solid KT 1820 resist coated at a thickness of 5000 A, 0. 6 um lines and spaces were resolved...|$|E
40|$|A {{pinhole camera}} {{was used to}} {{evaluate}} source geometry of the GCA 6700 <b>g-line</b> <b>stepper.</b> To create the camera, a photomask with various pinhole sizes was placed in the stepper, in close proximity to a wafer to generate an image. The images were evaluated to determine the shape and observe the radial intensity of the source. The variation across the source was evaluated because varying intensity across the wafer results and contributes to changes in critical dimension. Dose was varied in order to show how an illumination source might be characterized. As dose increased, the pinhole image became larger. Stacking the images could be used to create a three dimensional image of the source. Additionally, source images were used to verify the numerical aperture of the condenser lens of the illumination system...|$|E
40|$|An Integrated Phosphor Field Emission Device (IPFED) {{has been}} {{fabricated}} at the Rochester Institute of Technology {{for the purpose}} of developing a new, flat panel display technology. The device incorporates a new, cathodoluminescent, thin film phosphor (Ta 2 Zn 308) developed at RIT as an anode. A cathode and control gate, both consisting of a thin layer of molybdenum are also included in the device. Electrons are tunneled from the cathode via Fowler-Nordheim tunneling to energetically strike the phosphor anode. The anode then produces light, via cathodoluminescence, which the human eye can detect. Standard semiconductor processes were utilized in the fabrication of the device. These processes include; sputtering of Zinc Oxide, tantalum, molybdenum, and quartz, deposition of chemically vapor deposited (CVD) oxide, reactive ion etching of tantalum, molybdenum, and silicon dioxide using CHF 3 /He, CF 4 /H 2, or SF 6 plasmas, using a <b>G-line</b> <b>stepper</b> and diazonaphthoquinone (DNQ) novolac resin resists to pattern the aforementioned materials, and utilizing a Rapid Thermal Processor (RTP). The device can be scaled from ultra high resolution (10 jim pitch or less) to standard SVGA resolution (0. 28 mm pitch). Bright (no way to quantify) pixels have been observed at 200 nA of current at 100 V of acceleration energy. The control gate which was built into the structure does not function as designed due to shorting problems between the control gate and cathode. A process for the vacuum encapsulation of the devices has also been developed. This process does not require any special alignment of a separate faceplate. Many of the known problems with other field emissive displays have been circumvented by this new design...|$|E
