40|$|Instruction {{selection}} for embedded processors is a challenging problem. Embedded system architectures feature highly <b>irregular</b> <b>instruction</b> sets and complex data paths. Traditional code generation techniques have difficulties to fully utilize {{the features of}} such architectures and typically result in inefficient code. In this paper we describe an instruction selection technique that uses static single assignment graphs (SSA-graphs) as underlying data structure for selection. Patterns defined as graph grammar guide the instruction selection to find (nearly) optimal results. We present an approach which maps the pattern matching problem to a partitioned boolean quadratic optimization problem (PBQP). A linear PBQP solver computes optimal solutions for almost all nodes of a SSA-graph. We have implemented our approach in a production DSP compiler. Our experiments show that our approach achieves significant better results compared to classical tree matching...|$|E
40|$|Control {{programs}} for autonomous robots have to handle sensor inputs for condition determinations. Hence, such programs {{tend to become}} complicated. We have developed a robot controller board which can be programmed with virtual CPU instructions. The virtual CPU encapsulates details of I/O and <b>irregular</b> <b>instruction</b> sets, to make robot programming easier. However, virtual CPU instructions are still based on conditional jumps and thus was difficult to program for novice programmers. To overcome the problem, we have implemented a robot control language with structured syntax on top of Dolittle [1, 2, 4] environment. In this paper, we first explain firmware of our robot control board “MYUROBO ” [5], and previous Dolittle-based programming envirionment for the board. Then we discuss needs for structured control flows and explain our new (structured) language constructs, along with its implementation. ...|$|E
40|$|Due to an {{increasing}} need for flexibility, embedded systems embody {{more and more}} programmable processors as their core components. Because of silicon area and power considerations, the corresponding instruction sets are often highly encoded to minimize code size for given performance requirements. This has hampered the development of robust optimizing compilers because the resulting <b>irregular</b> <b>instruction</b> set architectures are far from convenient compiler targets. Among others, they introduce a strong phase coupling between the tasks of instruction selection and scheduling. Traditional methods perform these tasks in di#erent phases, thereby yielding inferior schedules. In this paper, we present an approach that reduces the need for explicit instruction selection by transferring constraints implied by the instruction set to static resource constraints. All resulting schedules are then guaranteed to correspond to a valid implementation with available instructions. We demonstrate a practical way to identify and construct a static resource model from a given instruction set. Experimental results show the e#cacy of our approach.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{computational}} applications lack instruction-level parallelism. This loss is particularly acute on sequences of dependent instructions on wide-issue or deeply pipelined architectures. We consider four real applications from computational biology, cryptanalysis, and data compression. These applications {{are characterized by}} long sequences of dependent <b>instructions,</b> <b>irregular</b> control-flow and intricate scalar and memory dependence patterns. While these benchmarks exhibit good memory locality and branch-predictability, state-of-the-art compiler optimizations fail to exploit much instruction-level parallelism. This paper shows that major performance gains are possible on such applications, through a loop transformation called deep jam. This transformation reshapes the control-flow of a program to facilitate the extraction of independent computations through classical back-end techniques. Deep jam combines accurate dependence analysis and control speculation, with a generalized form of recursive, multi-variant unroll-and-jam; it brings together independent <b>instructions</b> across <b>irregular</b> control structures, removing memory-based dependences through scalar and array renaming. This optimization contributes to the extraction of fine-grain parallelism in irregular applications. We propose a feedback-directed deep jam algorithm, selecting a jamming strategy, function of the architecture and application characteristics. 1. Introduction and Relate...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} compute-intensive {{applications}} suffer from performance loss {{due to the}} lack of instruction-level parallelism in sequences of dependent instructions. This is particularly accurate on wide-issue architectures with large register banks, when the memory hierarchy (locality and bandwidth) is not the dominant bottleneck. We consider two real applications from computational biology and from cryptanalysis, characterized by long sequences of dependent <b>instructions,</b> <b>irregular</b> control-flow and intricate scalar and array dependence patterns. Although these applications exhibit excellent memory locality and branch-prediction behavior, state-ofthe -art loop transformations and back-end optimizations are unable to exploit much instruction-level parallelism. We show that good speedups can be achieved through deep jam, a new transformation of the program control- and data-flow.

Because of silicon area and power considerations, the corresponding instruction sets are often highly encoded to minimize code size for given performance requirements. This has hampered the development of robust optimizing compilers because the resulting <b>irregular</b> <b>instruction</b> set architectures are far from convenient compiler targets. Among others, they introduce an interdependence between the tasks of instruction selection and scheduling. This so-called phase coupling is so strong that, in practice, instruction selection rather than scheduling {{is responsible for the}} quality of the schedule, which tends to disappoint. This lack of efficient compilation tools has also severely hampered the design space exploration of code-size efficient instruction sets, and correspondingly, their tuning to the application domain. In this paper, we present an approach that reduces the need for explicit instruction selection by transferring constraints implied by the instruction set to static resource constraints.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} urgent of STAIN Samarinda Boarding College Program (PESKAM) to {{redesign}} both its policy and its instructional {{framework for the}} irregular Islamic studies system, academic year 2014 / 2015, viewed from various aspects. The first aspect is {{about the effectiveness of}} irregular Islamic studies instructional achievement run in (academic year) 2103 / 2014. The second aspect is the leaders of STAIN Samarinda political interests concerning with PESKAM empowerment including institutional, instructional design, financial suffort, and the staffs. The third aspect is the regular Islamic studies lecturers’ academic sensitivity. And the last aspect is concerning with the design reliability of irregular Islamic studies program. The research shows that redesign is a must. It is imperative for STAIN Samarinda to redesign both PESKAM policy and its instructional framework for the irregular Islamic studies system. First, the system run during academic year 2013 / 2014 could not be considered effective. It did not use any general academic standards and could not be approached in terms of modern instructional management and design, such as the evaluation system designed to know periodically both the competence that a learner (a student in PESKAM) must be about to master and the process run to do such instruction as well.  However, all staffs and those who were in charge of managing the program worked hard and did all their best. Second, <b>irregular</b> Islamic studies <b>instruction</b> is viewed as the spirit for PESKAM in general. Its valuable benefit meets the stakeholders’ need. Finally, it is the cornerstone which can be accredited as the prime aspect distinguishing STAIN Samarinda from any general university (PTN/PTS) </em...|$|R
