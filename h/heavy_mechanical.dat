2500|$|Dredgers – use a dredge for {{collecting}} molluscs from the seafloor. There are {{three types of}} dredges: (a) The dredge can be dragged along the seabed, scooping the shellfish from the ground. These dredges are towed {{in a manner similar}} to beam trawlers, and large dredgers can work three or more dredges on each side. [...] (b) <b>Heavy</b> <b>mechanical</b> dredging units are operated by special gallows from the bow of the vessel. (c) The dredger employs a hydraulic dredge which uses a powerful water pump to operates water jets which flush the molluscs from the bottom. Dredgers don't have a typical deck arrangement, the bridge and accommodation can be aft or forward. Derricks and winches may be installed for lowering and lifting the dredge. Echosounders are used for determining depths.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe study {{considered}} {{issues for}} improving the efficiency of machining materials used in heavy power engineering {{on the basis of}} the development of carbide tools with nanostructured multilayer coatings (NMCC) of high wear resistance. The following compositions of the NMCC were developed for investigation: Ti-TiN-(TiCrAl) N; Zr-ZrN-(ZrNbCrAl) N; Cr-CrAlN-(NbZrCrAl) N; Zr-ZrN-(ZrCrAl) N. Wide-ranging studies of various properties and characteristics of elaborated NMCC, as well as contact parameters of cutting and wear mechanisms for the carbide tools with various compositions of NMCC are used in high-efficiency longitudinal turning material of <b>heavy</b> power <b>mechanical</b> engineering. Received results of research in this study allow establishing a rational coating composition for deposition on carbide tools providing increase of machining efficiency of the materials used in heavy power engineering...|$|R
