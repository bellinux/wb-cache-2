40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a Bayesian {{approach}} to image hallucination. Given a generic low resolution image, we hallucinate a high resolution image using {{a set of}} training images. Our work is inspired by recent progress on natural image statistics that the priors of image primitives can be well represented by examples. Specifically, primal sketch priors (e. g., edges, ridges and corners) are constructed and used to {{enhance the quality of}} the hallucinated high resolution image. Moreover, a contour smoothness constraint enforces consistency of primitives in the <b>hallucinated</b> <b>image</b> by a Markov-chain based inference algorithm. A reconstruction constraint is also applied to further improve the quality of the <b>hallucinated</b> <b>image.</b> Experiments demonstrate that our approach can hallucinate high quality super-resolution images. 1...|$|E

40|$|Deep {{models have}} {{achieved}} impressive performance for face hallucination tasks. However, we observe that directly feeding the <b>hallucinated</b> facial <b>images</b> into recog- nition models can even degrade the recognition performance despite the much better visualization quality. In this paper, we {{address this problem}} by jointly learning a deep model for two tasks, i. e. face hallucination and recognition. In particular, we design an end-to-end deep convolution network with hallucination sub-network cascaded by recognition sub-network. The recognition sub- network are responsible for producing discriminative feature representations using the <b>hallucinated</b> <b>images</b> as inputs generated by hallucination sub-network. During training, we feed LR facial images into the network and optimize the parameters by minimizing two loss items, i. e. 1) face hallucination loss measured by the pixel wise difference between the ground truth HR images and network-generated images; and 2) verification loss which {{is measured by the}} classification error and intra-class distance. We extensively evaluate our method on LFW and YTF datasets. The experimental results show that our method can achieve recognition accuracy 97. 95 % on 4 x down-sampled LFW testing set, outperforming the accuracy 96. 35 % of conventional face recognition model. And on the more challenging YTF dataset, we achieve recognition accuracy 90. 65 %, a margin over the recognition accuracy 89. 45 % obtained by conventional face recognition model on the 4 x down-sampled version.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose to convert the task of face {{hallucination}} into an image decomposition problem, and thenuse the morphological component analysis (MCA) for hallucinating a single face image, based on a novel three-stepframework. Firstly, a low-resolution input image is up-sampled by interpolation. Then, the MCA is employed to decompose the interpolated image into a high-resolution image and an unsharp masking, as MCA can properly decompose a signal into special parts according to typical dictionaries. Finally, a residue compensation, {{which is based on}} the neighbour reconstruction of patches, is performed to enhance the facial details. The proposed method can effectively exploit the facial properties for face hallucination under the image decomposition perspective.

For facial components, we align input images to generate accurate exemplars and transfer the high-frequency details for preserving structural consistency. For contours, we learn statistical priors to generate salient structures in the high-resolution images. A patch matching method is utilized on the smooth regions where the image gradients are preserved.

Because of the structural similarity among face images, in multiresolution analysis, there exists strong correlation between the high-frequency band and low-frequency band. For high-resolution face images, PCA can compact this correlated information onto a small number of principal components. Then, in the eigentransformation process, these principal components can be inferred from the principal components of the low-resolution face by mapping between the high- and low-resolution training pairs.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Face {{hallucination}} {{refers to}} inferring an High-Resolution (HR) face {{image from the}} input Low-Resolution (LR) one.

The eigentransfor-mation method based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which represents face image as a linear combination of the eigenfaces, has at-tracted considerable interests because of its simplicity and effectiveness. However, the face image observed is in a high-dimensional non-linear s-pace, whose statistical properties cannot be captured by the PCA based linear modeling method. To this end, in this paper we advance a Data-driven Local Eigentransformation (DLE) method for face hallucination by exploiting the local geometry structure of data manifold and learn-ing a specified eigentransformation model for each observed image.

40|$|For face identification, {{especially}} by human, {{it is desirable}} to render a high-resolution (HR) face image from the low-resolution (LR) one, which is called face hallucination or face super-resolution. A number of super-resolution techniques have been proposed in recent years. However, for face hallucination the utilization of the special properties of the faces is conductive to generate the HR face images. In this thesis, we propose a new face hallucination framework based on image patches, which integrates two novel statistical super-resolution models. Considering that image patches reflect the combined effect of personal characteristics and patch-location, we first formulate a TensorPatch model based on multilinear analysis to explicitly model the interaction between multiple constituent factors. Motivated by Locally Linear Embedding, we develop an enhanced multilinear patch hallucination algorithm, which efficiently exploits the local distribution structure in the sample space. To better preserve face subtle details, we derive the Coupled PCA algorithm to learn the relation between HR residue and LR residue, which is utilized for compensate the error residue in <b>hallucinated</b> <b>images.</b> Experiments demonstrate that our framework not only well maintains the global facial structures, but also recovers the detailed facial traits in high quality. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) In this thesis, we propose a novel dimensionality reduction algorithm called graph-regularized projection (GRP) to tackle the problem of semi-supervised dimensionality reduction that is rarely investigated in the literature. Given partially labeled data points, GRP aims at learning a not only smooth but also discriminative projection from high-dimensional data vectors to their latent low-dimensional representations. Motivated by recent semi-supervised learning process: graph regularization, we develop a graph-based regularization framework to enforce smoothness along the graph of the desired projection initiated by margin maximization. As a result, GRP has a natural out-of-sample extension to novel examples and thus can be generalized to the entire high-dimensional space. Extensive experiments on a synthetic dataset and several real databases demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm. Next, this thesis addresses {{the problem of how}} to learn an appropriate feature representation from video to benefit video-based face recognition. By simultaneously exploiting the spatial and temporal information, the problem is posed as learning Spatio-Temporal Embedding (STE) from raw videos. STE of a video sequence is defined as its condensed version capturing the essence of space-time characteristics of the video. Relying on the co-occurrence statistics and supervised signatures provided by training videos, STE preserves the intrinsic temporal structures hidden in video volume, meanwhile encodes the discriminative cues into the spatial domain. To conduct STE, we propose two novel techniques, Bayesian keyframe learning and nonparametric discriminant embedding (NDE), for temporal and spatial learning, respectively. In terms of learned STEs, we derive a statistical formulation to the recognition problem with a probabilistic fusion model. On a large face video database containing more than 200 training and testing sequences, our approach consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, achieving a perfect recognition accuracy.
