50|$|On April 30, , Pallone was {{involved}} in a highly controversial confrontation with Rose when he managed the Cincinnati Reds. Pallone was umpiring at first base when he called New York Mets outfielder Mookie Wilson safe on a <b>delayed</b> <b>call</b> in the ninth inning, with the delay giving Howard Johnson the time to score the eventual game-winning run. Rose immediately rushed to Pallone to argue both the call and how slowly it was made. With both tempers boiling over, Pallone was mocking Rose's gestures by pointing his finger at Rose, which led Rose to accuse Pallone of poking him in the face. Rose then shoved Pallone, causing Rose's immediate ejection. Pallone denied touching Rose and Major League Baseball never determined that he did in fact touch Rose, nor did they determine that he did not. The incident led to fans throwing garbage on the field, temporarily stopping the game and causing Pallone to be taken out of the game to ease tensions. The incident also resulted in Rose being suspended for 30 days with a $10,000 fine as well.|$|E

40|$|Objective : We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that responses to physiologic deterioration in hospital ward patients delayed by more than 15 minutes are associated with increased mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: We used data from a 23 -hospital cluster randomized trial (January 2004 to December 2004) of implementation of rapid response teams (intervention) versus standard practice with conventional cardiac arrest team-based responses to emergencies (control). We examined emergency calls in all hospitals. In intervention hospitals, we also examined such calls in the period before, during the introduction, and after the full implementation of a rapid response system. We studied the statistical association between such <b>delayed</b> <b>calls</b> and mortality. Main Outcomes and Measure: Hospital outcomes (mortality, unplanned ICU admissions, and cardiac arrests). Results: There were 3, 135 emergency team calls in all hospitals. Overall, almost one third of such <b>calls</b> were <b>delayed.</b> In intervention hospitals, the proportion of <b>delayed</b> <b>calls</b> was similar before and after implementation of rapid response teams. Compared with control hospitals, in intervention hospitals, {{there was a significant}} decrease in the proportion of <b>delayed</b> <b>calls</b> during both the introduction (27. 3 % vs 34. 3 % weekly rate; incidence rate ratio, 0. 84; p = 0. 001) and the full implementation period (29. 0 % vs 34. 5 % weekly rate; incidence rate ratio, 0. 84; p = 0. 023). <b>Delayed</b> <b>calls</b> more likely occurred at night, in high dependence or coronary care units, in patients older than 75 years, in those with a decrease in Glasgow Coma Scale, or in those with hypotension as the reason for the call. Finally, in all hospitals, <b>delayed</b> <b>calls</b> were associated with an increased risk of unplanned ICU admissions (adjusted odds ratio = 1. 56; 95 % CI, 1. 23 - 2. 04; p ≤ 0. 001) and death (adjusted odds ratio = 1. 79; 95 % CI, 1. 43 - 2. 27; p < 0. 001). Conclusions: Among ward patients, emergency team activation in response to acute deterioration triggered more than 15 minutes after detection and documentation of instability is independently associated with an increased risk of ICU admission and death.

5000|$|In ice hockey, play {{is said to}} be offside if {{a player}} on the attacking team crosses the {{offensive}} blue line and into the offensive zone before the puck (unless the defensive team brings the puck into their own zone). A violation occurs when an offside player touches the puck. If a player crosses the line ahead of the puck but his team is not in possession of it, the linesman will raise his arm to signal a delayed offside; when all players from the offside team leave their offensive zone ("tag up" [...] in the neutral zone) the linesman washes out the <b>delayed</b> <b>call.</b> When an offside violation occurs, the linesman blows the play dead, and a faceoff is conducted in the neutral zone. During the 2004-05 lockout, the league removed the [...] "two-line offside pass" [...] rule, which required a stoppage in play if a pass originating from inside a team's defending zone was completed on the offensive side of the center line, unless the puck crossed the line before the player. The removal of the two-line offside was one of several rule changes intended to increase overall scoring, which had been in decline since the early 1990s. The only time a player may precede the puck into the attacking zone with the puck behind in the neutral zone is if none of his teammates are in the attacking zone and the player with the puck has control of the puck in the estimation of the linesman (e.g. short-sticking/spin-o-rama).|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} a call center {{model with a}} callback option, which allows to transform an inbound call into an outbound one. A <b>delayed</b> <b>call,</b> with a long anticipated waiting time, receives the option to be called back. We assume a probabilistic customer reaction to the callback offer (option). The objective of the system manager is to characterize the optimal call scheduling that minimizes the expected waiting and abandonment costs. For the single-server case, we prove that non-idling is optimal. Using a Markov decision process approach, we prove for the two-server case that a threshold policy {{on the number of}} queued outbound calls is optimal. For the multi-server case, we numerically characterize a switching curve of the number of agents reserved for inbound calls. It {{is a function of the}} number of queued outbound calls, the number of busy agents and the identity of jobs in service. We also develop a Markov chain method to evaluate the system performance measures under the optimal policy. We next conduct a numerical study to examine the impact of the policy parameters on the system performance. We observe that the value of the callback offer is especially important for congested situations. It also appears that the benefits of a reservation policy are more apparent in large call centers, while they almost disappear in the extreme situations of light or heavy workloads. We moreover observe in most cases that the callback offer should be given upon arrival to any <b>delayed</b> <b>call.</b> However, if balking and abandonment are very high (which helps to reduce the workload) or if the overall treatment time spent to serve an outbound call is too large compared to that of an inbound one, there is a value in delaying the proposition of the callback offer...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{looks in}} depth at {{telephony}} server clusters, the modern switchboards {{at the core}} of a packet-based telephony service. The most widely used de facto standard protocols for telecommunications are the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Real Time Protocol (RTP). SIP is a signaling protocol used to establish, maintain, and tear down communication channel between two or more parties. RTP is a media delivery protocol that allows packets to carry digitized voice, video, or text. SIP telephony server clusters that provide communications services, such as an emergency calling service, must be scalable and highly available. We evaluate existing commercial and open source telephony server clusters to see how they differ in scalability and high availability. We also investigate how a scalable SIP server cluster can be built on a cloud computing platform. Elasticity of resources is an attractive property for SIP server clusters because it allows the cluster to grow or shrink organically based on traffic load. However, simply deploying existing clusters to cloud computing platforms is not good enough {{to take full advantage of}} elasticity. We explore the design and implementation of clusters that scale in real-time. The database tier of our cluster was modified to use a scalable key-value store so that both the SIP proxy tier and the database tier can scale separately. Load monitoring and reactive threshold-based scaling logic is presented and evaluated. Server clusters also need to reduce processing latency. Otherwise, subscribers experience low quality of service such as <b>delayed</b> <b>call</b> establishment, dropped calls, and inadequate media quality. Cloud computing platforms do not guarantee latency on virtual machines due to resource contention on the same physical host. These extra latencies from resource contention are temporary in nature. Therefore, we propose and evaluate a mechanism that temporarily distributes more incoming calls to responsive SIP proxies, based on measurements of the processing delay in proxies. Availability of SIP server clusters is also a challenge on platforms where a node may fail anytime. We investigated how single component failures in a cluster can lead to a complete system outage. We found that for single component failures, simply having redundant components of the same type are enough to mask those failures. However, for client-facing components, smarter clients and DNS resolvers are necessary. Throughout the thesis, a prototype SIP proxy cluster is re-used, with variations in the architecture or configuration, to demonstrate and address issues mentioned above. This allows us to tie all of our approaches for different issues into one coherent system that is dynamically scalable, is responsive despite latency varations of virtual machines, and is tolerant of single component failures in cloud platforms...|$|E

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of delay depends {{to a large}} extent on the following four basic operations: delay, wakeup, interrupt, and resume. Traditional implementations of delay in the WAM are slow because three out of the four basic operations need to save or restore the argument registers. In this paper, we present a novel method for implementing delay in a Prolog machine called ATOAM. The main idea is to store <b>delayed</b> <b>calls</b> as frames, called suspension frames, on the control stack rather than as records on the heap. Since <b>delayed</b> <b>calls,</b> after being woken, can be executed directly by using their suspension frames, the four basic operations become very simple. This method had been predicated to cost a large amount of control stack space. However, with tail-recursion elimination, the control stack space requirement can be reduced dramatically. This method has been implemented in the B-Prolog system. For several benchmark programs where delay is used, the experimental results show that B-Prolog is [...] ...|$|R
