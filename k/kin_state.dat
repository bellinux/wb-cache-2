40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{systematically}} analyze the role played by kin states in neighboring secessionist conflicts involving their co-nationals. Ethnic kin states are typically those states which border or are close to the secessionist region and which contains co-nationals of the secessionists with whom the secessionists share and maintain strong ethnocultural and ethnoreligious bonds. Additionally, these co-nationals must be a homeland society (as opposed to a diaspora community) for the state to be classified as an ethnic <b>kin</b> <b>state.</b> The co-nationals could be either a numerical majority or a minority in the ethnic <b>kin</b> <b>state.</b> Further, they could be either a dominant or a subordinate ethnic group in the <b>kin</b> <b>state.</b> If the co-nationals are a numerical majority and control the <b>kin</b> <b>state,</b> then the secessionists may come to regard the <b>kin</b> <b>state</b> as their mother state. For instance, Russians living in Ukraine or Moldova will typically come to regard Russia as their mother state. Similarly, Serbs in Bosnia or Croatia consider Serbia to be their mother state. Ch. I.

40|$|Summary of {{the book}} {{containing}} this chapter:] Map lines delineating statehood can become blurred by bloodlines of nationhood. Inter-ethnic conflict and genocide have demonstrated the dangers of failing to protect people targeted by fellow citizens. When minority groups in one country are targeted for killings or ethnic cleansing based on their group identity, whose responsibility is it to protect them? In particular, are they owed any protective responsibility by their <b>kin</b> <b>state?</b> How can cross-border kinship ties strengthen greater pan-national identity across borders without challenging territorially defined national security? As shown by the Russia–Georgia conflict over South Ossetia, unilateral intervention by a <b>kin</b> <b>state</b> can lead to conflict within and between states. The world cannot stand by when minority rights are being trampled, but the protection of national minorities {{should not be used}} as an excuse to violate state sovereignty and generate inter-state conflict. This book suggests that a sensible answer to the <b>kin</b> <b>state</b> dilemma might come from the formula “neither intervention nor indifference” that recognizes the special bonds but proscribes armed intervention based on the ties of kinship...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the question of}} why the kinship factor {{has not been able to}} provide a viable basis upon which Indonesia-Malaysia relations can be organised, despite the fact that the language of kinship continues to frame diplomatic discourse between the two "kin states". As a study of the phenomenon of kinship in international relations, the thesis discusses the basis of kinship discourse in Indonesia-Malaysia relations, how kinship was politicised in terms of its conceptualisation and application, and why its dominant motif has been rivalry more than harmony, despite its regular evocation. In order to understand the kinship factor as a political phenomenon in Indonesia-Malaysia relations, four issues are considered: (1) the anthropological and sociological nature of kinship, (2) the politicisation of kinship in terms of the perception and interpretation of its attendant expectations and obligations, (3) the association of the kinship factor with the historical process of identity building and nation formation in Indonesia and Malaysia, and (4) the discrepancies between popular pressures to emphasise kinship, which imply extra-national loyalties, and the political calculations of leaders based on conceptions of sovereignty. Consequently, the study makes the observation that despite the fact that there is a basis upon which to define Indonesia and Malaysia as <b>kin</b> <b>states,</b> their "special relationship" has been characterised predominantly by tension. It argues that this state of affairs has been a consequence of the perceived failure of these <b>kin</b> <b>states</b> to fulfil the expectations and obligations of kinship. This, in turn, has been borne of fundamental differences in their respective historical experiences and the forging of their national identities, which contravened the loyalties wrought by the kinship factor. Having said that, there remain avenues for co-identification on the basis of kinship, particularly in reference to the influence of the "Chinese factor" that has traditionally been a cause for concern for the national identities and security of Indonesia and Malaysia...|$|R

It is a dynamic approach, which Erin Jenne argues goes beyond the limits of explaining minority actions using purely structural features of a group, including economic status. This article questions to what extent, if any, do shifts in the economic status of a minority, host-state and <b>kin</b> <b>state</b> affect the ethnic bargaining game, particularly in times of crisis. It uses a comparative case study of the Albanian and Hungarian minorities in Serbia since 2006, in order to explore whether or not the differences between their mobilization activities can be adequately explained by expanding Jenne’s ethnic bargaining model to include structural economic differences. It concludes that although inclusion of economic status as an additional piece in the ethnic bargaining puzzle does expand the levels of analysis, ultimately it does not address other limitations of using the model to understand minority mobilization...|$|E

The Roma community has become targets of discriminatory policies in Italy, such as forced evictions and ethnic profiling by the authorities, which construct Roma as distinct from the Italian nation. Roma activists increasingly circumvent national political structures and instead regard the European Union (EU) as an ally in redressing discriminatory policies in member states. In {{the absence of a}} <b>kin</b> <b>state</b> to lobby and advocate on their behalf, Roma activists, working in the transnational political context, articulate their voice and demands to the institutions of the EU.

40|$|This article {{explains}} {{the impact of}} substate nationalism on the political dynamic surrounding ethnic kin migration through {{a case study of}} Sri Lankan Tamil refugees in the southern Indian State of Tamil Nadu. Examples drawn from the migration studies literature identify ethnic kinship between refugees and host as an indicator of favorable reception and assistance. While this expectation is borne out to an extent in the Tamil Nadu case, it is tempered by a period of hostility following the 1991 assassination of former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi by an LTTE suicide bomber, when the refugees were figured as a disruptive and dangerous presence by Tamil Nadu's political elites. A version of the "triadic nexus" model of <b>kin</b> <b>state</b> relations, reconfigured to accommodate the larger political unit within which the substate nationalism is incorporated, is proposed as a framework of analysis for these events. This can better account for Tamil Nadu's substate ethnonationalist elite's movement between expressions of coethnic solidarity with the refugees and the more hostile, security-focused response postassassination.

40|$|Ethnonationalist Conflict in Postcommunist States investigates {{why some}} Eastern European states transitioned to {{new forms of}} {{governance}} with minimal violence while others broke into civil war. In Bulgaria, the Turkish minority was subjected to coerced assimilation and forced expulsion, but the nation ultimately negotiated peace through institutional channels. In Macedonia, periodic outbreaks of insurgent violence escalated to armed conflict. Kosovo's internal warfare culminated in NATO's controversial bombing campaign. In the twenty-first century, these conflicts were subdued, but violence continued to flare occasionally and impede durable conflict resolution. In this comparative study, Maria Koinova applies historical institutionalism to conflict analysis, tracing ethnonationalist violence in postcommunist states to a volatile, formative period between 1987 and 1992. In this era of instability, the incidents that brought majorities and minorities into dispute {{had a profound impact}} and a cumulative effect, as did the interventions of international agents and <b>kin</b> <b>states.</b> Whether the conflicts initially evolved in peaceful or violent ways, the dynamics of their disputes became self-perpetuating and informally institutionalized. Thus, external policies or interventions could affect only minimal change, and the impact of international agents subsided over time. Regardless of the constitutions, laws, and injunctions, majorities, minorities, international agents, and <b>kin</b> <b>states</b> continue to act in accord with the logic of informally institutionalized conflict dynamics. Koinova analyzes the development of those dynamics in Bulgaria, Macedonia, and Kosovo, drawing on theories of democratization, international intervention, and path-dependence as well as interviews and extensive fieldwork. The result is a compelling account of the underlying causal mechanisms of conflict perpetuation and change that will shed light on broader patterns of ethnic violence.

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{national}} minorities in post-Cold War Europe has warranted considerable scholarly attention {{with regard to}} security, democratization and regional integration.

Has European integration served to dampen or to intensify the salience of nationalist politics between host and kin states? To address this gap the range of host state-kin state relations in Central and Eastern Europe is explored corresponding to whether both states are EU members (at least one may be a candidate country) compared with when one state remains external to the EU for the foreseeable future. It is argued that, despite much of the Europeanization literature, European integration can have an amplifying effect on nationalism regardless of whether kin states are existing members, acceding states or outside the process altogether...|$|E
40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{objective of}} this dissertation is to explore whether and how "Europeanization" is an effective Conflict Resolution mechanism to produce sustainable solutions to cross-border ethno-nationalist conflicts at {{the periphery of the}} European Union, namely the Western Balkans. Accepting "Europeanization" as "an analytical concept used to examine the changes in domestic structures and policies that occur in response to policies and practices institutionalized at the European level" three levels of analysis will be explored: (a) the protection of minorities in the domestic legislative level, and (b) the resolution of inter-ethnic conflicts {{as a result of this}} democratization; and (c) whether this "Europeanization" at domestic level, namely adopting the norms of minority protection in the domestic level fosters a cooperation between the host-state and the neighbouring <b>kin</b> <b>state</b> as the neo-functional theories on European integration proposed. In other words, would "internal Europeanization" foster "external Europeanization" in the Western Balkans? In order to assess the impact of "Europeanization" and evaluate the efficiency of these policies on the resolution of ethno-territorial cross-border conflicts which lie at the core of the antagonisms in this region of Western Balkans, three cases will be analysed all of which are centered on the question of "external minority", that is "an ethnic group that, while residing in one state (the host-state) is related through shared cultural, religious or linguistic characteristics, which it wishes to preserve, and through kinship to the titular nation of another, often neighbouring state (the kin-state).

These states are deeply divided along ethnic-linguistic, religious and cultural lines between the Hungarian minority communities versus non-Hungarian, i. e. Slovak, Serb, Romanian and Ukrainian majority communities. The situation of the Hungarian minorities and the relations of the Hungarians and the majority populations have not improved structurally {{after the fall of}} communism and the Europeanization of Central and Eastern Europe. This state of affairs negatively affects the relations between the states concerned and neighbouring <b>kin</b> <b>state</b> Hungary jeopardizing cohesion in the European Union and risking safety and security in Central Europe and the Balkans. This paper presents an empirical analysis of the state of affairs in the territories inhabited by the Hungarian minorities discussing the root, character and scope of the conflicts. The paper further discusses the theoretical options for a solution screening the complete repertory of concepts of "territorial" politics, like ethnic autonomy and minority rights. The paper will analyse the architectural and legal options the EU offers for governing these conflicts, both territorial and nonterritorial tools, including the spill-over effects of independent statehood and minority rights protection in the case of Kosovo. From the empirical data and the theoretical analysis a set of tools will be formulated fitting the nature of the societies involved contributing to the management of conflicts in the Central European states with Hungarian minorities. Finally, in an appendix the position of the Hungarian minorities in the Carpathian Basin will be compared with the position of a national minority in Western Europe, the Frisians in the Netherlands. It will be concluded that their position is complementary and that more cooperation between them would be mutually advantageous...|$|E

Samples of 84 committed and 84 voluntarily admitted patients in 1991 and 118 committed and 117 voluntarily admitted patients in 1997 - 99 were interviewed within 5 days from admission and at discharge, or after 3 weeks of care. Samples of 64 next-of-kins to the committed patients and 69 next-of-kins to the voluntarily admitted patients in 1991, and 73 and 89 next-of-kins, respectively, in 1997 - 99 were interviewed approximately 1 month after the admission. Few changes in attitudes were found between the two study occasions. A majority of all patients stated that it should be possible to compulsorily admit patients, and a great majority of the patients and the next-of <b>kins</b> <b>stated</b> that decisions regarding compulsory admission should be taken by doctors.

Under Tennessee law, non-next of kin may not bring a claim under the circumstances as alleged by plaintiffs across the state of Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama. Under Tennessee law only next of kin may maintain a claim. Therefore, if the deceased is survived by a spouse the spouse has a claim and no other family member has a claim. The Tennessee Court of Appeals has outlined a succession of who may be a next of kin depending on which next of kin survives the deceased. The ruling of the Court of Appeals resulted in a dismissal of numerous non-next of kin cases.|$|R

They are a transnational minority without a <b>kin</b> <b>state</b> [...] which continue to. be the most marginalized. and discriminated ethnic group in Europe. This thesis asks: 'Who Speaks for the Roma?' In doing so it analyses organizing structures of representation in domestic and transnational political contexts arguing that these structures articulate the shared interests of the Romani community. Whilst the role of state structure. s and international organizations is acknowledged they are ultimately downplayed in favour of representation structures which the Roma social movement create themselves. The thesis examines three types of organizing structures of representation in Hungary and Romania which claim to legitimately represent {{the interests of the}} Roma: elites; political parties; and civil society organizations. The investigation then asks whether transnational organizing. structures of representation can legitimately claim to represent the Roma: transnational advocacy networks; International Romani non-governmental organizations; and the European Roma' and Traveller Forum. The Roma social movement creates these representation structures with reference to their ethnic group identity. The purpose of these organizing structures of representation is to articulate the shared interests of the Romani community which are necessarily suppressed by the utilitarian principles of liberal democratic polities. However not all those who claim to represent the interests of the Roma do so legitimately, thus this thesis determines how legitimate these organizing structures of representation actually are. Theoretically this thesis seeks to advance understandings of the complex relationship between ethnic mobilization, interest articulation, and legitimate representation with regard to minorities, and empirically it details the case of Romani political participation in Hungary and Romania, as well as the transnational political context.

40|$|A burgeoning {{literature}} {{argues that}} the abundance of oil in developing countries strengthens autocratic rule and erodes democracy. However, extant studies either show the average cross-national correlation between oil and political regime or develop particularistic accounts that do not easily lend themselves to theorizing. Consequently, we know little of the causal mechanisms that potentially link oil wealth to undemocratic outcomes and the conditions that would help explain the ultimate, not average, effect of oil on political regime. This study develops a conditional theory of the “political resource curse. ” It does so by undertaking a statistical reassessment {{of the relationship between}} oil wealth and political regime and a nuanced qualitative examination of a set of carefully selected cases in order to contribute to developing an adequate account of causal mechanisms that transmit and conditions that shape the relationship between oil abundance and autocracy. It draws on qualitative and quantitative evidence collected over eighteen months of fieldwork in oil-rich former Soviet countries of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan, and the ‘counterfactual’ oil-poor Kyrgyzstan. Employing a theoretical framework that draws on insights from the rentier state theory, historical institutionalism, and rational choice institutionalism, I trace, compare, and contrast the processes that potentially link oil wealth to regime outcomes in these countries between 1989 and 2010. The findings strongly suggest that political regime differences can be better explained by the interaction of oil wealth with several structural and institutional variables rather than by oil abundance or another single factor alone. A thorough qualitative analysis of the post-Soviet cases shows that the causal mechanisms hypothesized in the ‘resource curse’ literature were neither necessarily present, nor uniform across these cases and throughout the post-Soviet period. This was because a particular interaction of exogenous variables and oil wealth affected the causal mechanisms differently, ultimately entailing different regime outcomes. The spread of alternative political elites, relative size of the ethnic minority with ties to a powerful <b>kin</b> <b>state,</b> and oil production geography were key exogenous factors that consistently interacted with oil in affecting the political regimes...|$|E

Youths engaged in political parties might also influence kin state’s approaches towards its kin groups. Their understanding may shape youths’ contribution and approaches towards peace and conflicts. This study attempts to explore the understanding of youth in the <b>kin</b> <b>state</b> concerning their kin groups’ conflicts. In this research, {{the focus is on}} the understanding of youths who are members of political party youth forums in Albania, on ethnic Albanians’ conflicts in Kosovo and in Macedonia. Specifically, youths members of four political youth forums in Albania were interviewed. Adding the interviewees done with a control group of youth not engaged in any political party’s youth forum, a total 14 semi-structured interviews were conducted. The interviewees were selected via snowball sampling and text analysis was employed to analyze the collected data. In this research political ideology appeared as an important factor that might influence youths’ understanding of their kin groups’ conflicts. Moreover, youth with nationalist ideology supported the nationalist approach and youth from the parties that were not based on the nationalist ideology supported the cooperative and peaceful approach towards their kin groups’ conflicts. Additionally, the need for more inclusion of youth in Albanian politics appeared. This study suggests that inclusion of youths without nationalist ideology in politics would bring more positive contribution to the resolution of their kin groups’ conflicts, and inclusion of youths with nationalist ideology may bring negative contribution, due to their support to the nationalist approach. This research has theoretical and practical implications. The theoretical implication focuses on enriching the literature on the factors that can influence youths’ understanding of peace and conflict and adds to the literature knowledge on the influence of political ideology on youth’s understanding. The practical implication lies at providing knowledge to the governments to validate the potentials of youth with a vision of peace and be aware that political ideology of youths might shape their attitudes and behaviors toward peace and conflict...|$|E

Mechanisms underlying kin recognition often rely on signaling from one individual to another using chemical cues that are genetically encoded. Because of this presence of kin recognition and high similarity of mechanisms in the different species, kin recognition seems to have arisen in an early step of evolution. This early evolutionary origin of kin recognition does not mean that all organisms use the same system but there are common themes. Besides the use of olfaction for communication, the chemical cues underlying kin recognition seem to be linked to molecules and mechanisms also used in immune functions. ...|$|R
50|$|Polistes bellicosus {{does not}} {{directly}} follow the Hymenopteran haplo-diploid genetic system where female workers are more related to their sisters (0.75 degree of relatedness) than to their own offspring (0.50). The relatively lower level of relatedness could be explained either by multiple mating—queens mating {{with more than one}} reproductive male—or by the presence of multiple egg-layers within a colony. <b>Kin</b> selection theory <b>states</b> that selection favors individuals who act altruistically when the ratio {{of the cost of the}} fitness of the giver to the benefit of the recipient is less than the degree of relatedness between the two individuals. In P. bellicosus, foundresses aid fairly close relatives instead of individuals that are unrelated, which explains variation in helping within species.|$|R
40|$|It is {{estimated}} that 86 % of children aged 2 to 14 are subjected to sexual, emotional and physical abuse globally. Regardless of the vulnerable situations, which expose children {{to the risk of}} being harmed, it is very possible to prevent children from harm by having commitments and deliberate efforts by different actors such as families (including <b>kin),</b> communities, <b>states,</b> NGOs, international organizations, or other stakeholders concerned with the best interests of children. The purpose of this thesis was to explore experiences of collaboration between Advocacy Non Governmental Organizations and Government Social Welfare Officers in preventing children from sexual, emotional and physical abuse in Arusha, Tanzania. The thesis is a fieldwork study employing in-depth interviews as method of data collection. Secondary data was also used in this study. The study included three government social welfare officers and three representatives from advocacy nongovernmental organizations. The study findings indicated that collaboration between advocacy NGOs and government social welfare officers exists. Furthermore, the study also disclosed opportunities and challenges of collaboration between advocacy NGOs and government social welfare officers Apart from getting their experience of protecting children from harm, the sample was able to demonstrate nature and experience of collaboration between Arusha City Social Welfare Officers and Advocacy NGOs working in the child sector in Arusha...|$|R
