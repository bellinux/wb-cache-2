50|$|In {{core type}} <b>friction</b> <b>spinning,</b> the core, {{made of a}} {{filament}} or a bundle of staple fibres, is false twisted by the spinning drum. The sheath fibres are deposited on the false twisted core surface and are wrapped helically over the core with varying helix angles. It is believed that the false twist in the core gets removed once the yarn is emerged from the spinning drums, so that this yarn has a virtually twist-less core. However, {{it is quite possible}} for some amount of false twist to remain {{in the fact that the}} sheath entraps it during yarn formation in the spinning zone.|$|E

Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy at Loughborough University. <b>Friction</b> <b>spinning</b> is a relative newcomer to textile technology. It has generated great interest because of its potential for wide application of certain problems regarding the quality of yarn produced at high output rates can be solved. General acceptance of the process is hindered by uncertainty as to its capability of producing yarns of sufficient strength at speeds greater than 300 m/min. (NB: as a guide, maximum output rates of competitive technologies {{are no more than}} 150 m/min.) <b>Friction</b> <b>spinning</b> appears to have no intrinsic self-limit to its maximum output rate, unlike ring and rotor spinning which are limited by centrifugal effects leading to excessive yarn breakages. The process will therefore provide something of a quantum leap in output if acceptable yarn quality is achieved. [Continues. ...|$|E

Two types of thin NiTi-SMA wires (SMA MEMRY wire and FLEXINOL Actuator wire) were used as {{the core of the}} yarn. Both 100 % cotton and polypropylene (PP) fibers were used as the sheath and core fibers respectively. The selected machine parameters were arranged and categorised into several machine parameter plans. The first plan was focused on the determination of the appropriate yarn size to be spun the core-sheath yarn on the DREF 3000 <b>friction</b> <b>spinning</b> machine. The second plan was arranged to investigate the NiTi- SMA CSFY yarn mechanical properties. The third plan was arranged to validate the NiTi-SMA CSFY yarn actuation performance upon the parameters changes, in specific, the spinning drum speed, delivery speed and air-suction pressure. The appropriate Tex value was found to be 320 Tex as it was successfully spun the NiTi-SMA CSFY yarn without caused of machine stoppages. The results showed that the strength of both NiTi- SMA CSFY yarns (from SMA MEMRY wire and FLEXINOL Actuator wire) declined as the core-sheath ratio and delivery speed increased from 40 to 60 % and 100 to 160 m/min respectively. The strip resistance of the NiTi-SMA CSFY yarn (SMA MEMRY wire) increased with the increase in the spinning drum speed, delivery speed and core-sheath ratio. Under the thermal heating test, the actuation time of the NiTi- SMA CSFY (SMA MEMRY wire) yarn reduced approximately 5 to 93 %, 39 to 91 % and 15 to 87 % as the spinning drum speed increased from 3000 to 4400 rpm and coresheath ratio from 40 to 60 %, respectively. The NiTi-SMA CSFY yarn (FLEXINOL Actuator wire) showed faster shape recovery at approximately 0. 01 s in comparison with the NiTi-SMA CSFY yarn (SMA MEMRY wire) when it was heated through the resistive heating test. The pre-set shape of the SMA MEMRY wire (spiral annealed) and FLEXINOL Actuator wire (straight annealed) gave different NiTi-SMA CSFY yarn physical appearances, mechanical properties, actuation performance and affected the SMA wire actuation performances in both the woven and knitted fabric structures...|$|E
40|$|A {{volumetric}} contact dynamics {{model has}} been proposed by Gonthier et al. [1, 2, 3] {{for the purpose of}} rapidly generating reliable simulations of space-based manipulator contact dynamics. By assuming materials behave as a Winkler elastic foundation model, forces and moments between two bodies in contact can be expressed in terms of the volume of interference between the undeformed geometries of the bodies. Friction between bodies is modelled by a dwell-time dependent bristle model for both tangential <b>friction,</b> and <b>spinning</b> <b>friction</b> torque. This volumetric model has a number of advantages. Unlike point-contact models, it allows for the modelling of contact between complex geometries and scenarios where the contact surface is relatively large, while being less computationally expensive than finite element methods. Rolling resistance is included in the model through damping effects across the volume of interference. The friction model accounts for dwell-time dependent slip-stick effects, <b>spinning</b> <b>friction</b> torque, and the Contensou effect. In this thesis, an experimental validation of the volumetric contact model is presented for the first time. Models for simple geometries in contact (e. g. cylinder-on-plane, sphere-on-plane) have been developed for stationary contact and for contact with motion normal and tangential to the contact surface. Tangential motion is modelled with pure translation, pure rotation about the normal axis, and combined motion, in order to separately consider <b>friction</b> forces, <b>spinning</b> <b>friction</b> torque, and the Contensou effect, respectively. An apparatus has been developed to experimentally validate these models for metal-on-metal contact. The apparatus has two configurations, one for validating the normal contact models and the other for the friction models. Experimental measurements of forces and displacements are used to identify model parameters (e. g. volumetric stiffness, friction coefficients, etc.). For normal force experiments, modelling the contact forces as proportional to volume of interference was found to be a reasonable approximation. A Hertzian model was compared with the volumetric model for spherical payloads loaded quasi-statically. Using stiffnesses estimated from spherical experiments, small misalignments of the cylindrical payloads were estimated that corresponded well with measured results. Dynamic experiments suggest an inverse relationship between impact velocity and the hysteretic damping coefficient. The high normal forces applied in the friction experiments were found to create significant wear on the contact surfaces. Coefficients of friction between titanium and aluminum were found to be consistent translationally and rotationally. Friction forces from combined translation and rotation demonstrate that the Contensou effect is accurately described by the volumetric contact model...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fabrication method for multicolored composite yarn {{based on a}} tri-coaxial yarn architecture by using a <b>friction</b> <b>spinning</b> machine. The yarn consists of a core, intermediate layer and outer layer in a coaxial form for accommodating fibers in different colors. The influence of fiber weight ratio of the intermediate layer to outer layer on yarn structure in terms of fiber coverage for each layer as well as yarn properties was investigated to identify the appropriate fiber weight ratio for yarn production. The results from the experiments show that the magnitude of fiber coverage of the intermediate layer on the yarn core increases {{with the increase of}} fiber weight ratio, while the fiber coverage performance of the outer layer on the intermediate layer of the yarn becomes better when a lower fiber weight ratio is adopted. The fiber weight ratio also has an effect on the yarn properties, including strength and elongation, hairiness, evenness and imperfection. Based on the evaluation of yarn structure and properties, a fiber weight ratio of 0. 50 was selected to produce the multicolored composite yarns for woven fabrics. A weft-faced woven fabric was produced by using the developed multicolored composite yarns as weft yarns. Then, the laser engraving treatment with appropriate laser fluence from a feasible working range of both laser resolution and pixel time was applied to woven fabric to create a multicolor effect. The treated woven fabric exhibits a unique pattern effect using the developed multicolored effect composite yarns. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|E
