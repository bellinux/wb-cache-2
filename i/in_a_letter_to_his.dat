5|$|Historian Robert Powell {{opined that}} Wickliffe's break from party loyalty may explain {{his lack of}} {{committee}} appointments in his early years in the House. Beginning in 1829, however, he chaired the Committee on Public Lands. In this capacity, he attacked Clay's plan to distribute surplus revenue among the states as being unfair to younger states. He also differed with Clay over Clay's willingness to limit slavery. He wrote Clay concerning his slowness {{to respond to the}} problem of fugitive slaves; Clay never responded. Neither was Wickliffe loyal to the Jacksonian platform, however. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> brother, he lamented Jackson's attacks on the Second Bank of the United States. He publicly encouraged Kentuckians to strengthen the Whigs, despite his disagreements with Clay.|$|E

5|$|In September 1554, Mary stopped menstruating. She gained weight, {{and felt}} nauseated in the mornings. For these reasons, almost the {{entirety}} of her court, including her doctors, believed her to be pregnant. Parliament passed an act making Philip regent {{in the event of}} Mary's death in childbirth. In the last week of April 1555, Elizabeth was released from house arrest, and called to court as a witness to the birth, which was expected imminently. According to Giovanni Michieli, the Venetian ambassador, Philip may have planned to marry Elizabeth in the event of Mary's death in childbirth, but <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> brother-in-law, Maximilian of Austria, Philip expressed uncertainty as to whether his wife was pregnant.|$|E
5|$|Prospective colourists at A. Farsari & Co. {{were interviewed}} by Farsari himself, who ensured they were {{familiar}} with Japanese painting techniques. Once hired, they were given unpaid instruction for several months, and then a basic salary that steadily increased as Farsari became satisfied with their work. A capable and loyal colourist could earn twice the rate offered at other Yokohama studios and double his own daily rate for work on Sundays. Colourists also received regular bonuses and gifts. On the other hand, Farsari complained <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> sister that to motivate his employees he had to rage, swear and beat them, which he did according to a fixed schedule. By 1891 A. Farsari & Co. had 32 employees, 19 of whom were hand-colouring artists.|$|E
5|$|Jennings's {{personal}} finances {{suffered from}} the panic of 1819, while the Indiana governorship continued to increase his financial burden. Jennings {{was never able to}} recover from his debts. One historian suggests that Jennings's financial situation may arisen from the expenses incurred during his political campaigns, his long-time service in state government, and being too busy to adequately manage his farm. Jennings and his wife frequently entertained visitors, legislators, and other dignitaries at their Corydon home. At a high-profile dinner in 1819, he hosted President James Monroe and General Andrew Jackson at a dinner held in their honor in Jeffersonville, when the two leaders were making a tour of the frontier states. In 1822 Jennings solicited a $1,000 personal loan from the Harmonists <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> political ally, George Rapp, but his request was denied. Jennings was able to secure personal loans from friends by granting mortgages on his land. Earlier in his career as a land speculator at Vincennes, when land prices decreased significantly, he was forced to sell several tracts of land at a loss.|$|E

5|$|Pinkerton, who in 1816 was the BFBS's {{representative}} in Moscow, had met that {{year with a}} community of Albanians in Vienna, then capital of the Austrian Empire. They assured him that a translation of the New Testament into Albanian was indeed possible. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> superiors at the BFBS, dated August 28, 1816, Pinkerton wrote that the Albanian nation occupied {{a large part of}} the ancient Illyria, that they spoke a language completely different from Slavic, Turkish, Greek, or Latin, and that for the Albanian Orthodox the mass was recited in Greek, a language that believers and even some of the priests did not understand. According to Pinkerton, the translation could be done by one or more Albanians from the Ionian islands under the supervision of an Albanian bishop.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{casualties}} endured by both armies differs according to the authors. The Italian Jesuit Famiano Strada noted that Farnese, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> father Ottavio, Duke of Parma, put the Dutch loss as 600 men killed and gave eight men killed and 40 wounded amongst his troops. Strada also mentions that other estimations pointed to 1,040 men killed in the Dutch ranks. On the other hand, the Flemish author Guillaume Baudart set the Dutch loss as 200 men killed and claimed that the Spanish Army lost 500 men. The villages of Deurne and Borgerhout were seriously damaged by the fire during the battle: in 1580 Deurne had 133 standing buildings, while 146 had been destroyed by the fire; in Borgerhout 206 buildings remained and 280 were ruined.|$|E
5|$|Charles had won {{one of his}} {{greatest}} victories at Grodno 1706, by simply cutting off his opponents' resources and supplies. Later, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> ally Frederick IV of Denmark, Peter I confirmed losses of up to 17,000 men during the encirclement and retreat. After his pursuit of the Russian army, having chased them out of Lithuania, Charles saw his opportunity to march back to Poland {{in order to meet}} up with Rehnskiöld, in preparation for the invasion of Saxony. He arrived there in August 5. Meanwhile, Schulenburg did what he could in an attempt to increase the Saxon army to measure the expected invasion from the Swedes, something which was proven close to impossible after the battle of Fraustadt. In a last attempt to stop the invasion, Augustus II of Saxony offered Courland to Sweden and Lithuania to the newly crowned king Stanisław I of Poland. The generous offer was, however denied by Charles who crossed the Saxon border in September 5. As Saxony was close to defenseless, the Swedes could easily push away any resisting troops. In September 19, they occupied the city of Leipzig which finally forced Augustus into unconditional peace under Swedish terms. Among other things, the traitor and second principal behind the Grodno campaign, Johann Patkul was turned into Swedish custody.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many of his}} countrymen, Słowacki {{decided to}} stay in France as a {{political}} refugee. In 1832 he published his first collections of poems and his first two dramas (Mindowe and Maria Stuart). He also met Mickiewicz again; reportedly, Mickiewicz approached his younger colleague and shook his hand. However, Słowacki's poems, written in the 1820s, were unpopular among his Polish compatriots, as they failed to capture the sentiment of a people living under foreign occupation. Słowacki was angered by Mickiewicz, who not only stole the limelight with his Księgi narodu polskiego i pielgrzymstwa polskiego (Books of the Polish nation and pilgrimage), but his part three of Dziady (1832) cast Słowacki's stepfather, professor Bécu, {{in the role of}} a villain. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> mother Słowacki wrote that immediately after reading that work he was ready to challenge Mickiewicz for a duel; that did not come to pass but from that moment on, Słowacki would see Mickiewicz as his main rival. Few days later, antagonized by worsening reception of his works among the Polish émigré community in Paris, including sharp criticism from Mickiewicz, Słowacki left on a trip to Geneva, Switzerland. The French authorities denied him the right to return to France {{as part of a larger}} program to rid the country of the potentially subversive Polish exiles who had settled there.|$|E

25|$|Zemlinsky's best-known {{work is the}} Lyric Symphony (1923), a seven-movement {{piece for}} soprano, {{baritone}} and orchestra, set to poems by the Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore (in German translation), which Zemlinsky compared <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> publisher to Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde (though {{the first part of}} Schoenberg's Gurre-Lieder is also a clear influence).

25|$|The initial view, {{reported}} by Horace Smith-Dorrien, {{was that the}} British had difficulty unpacking their ammunition boxes fast enough and that the quartermasters were reluctant to distribute ammunition to units other than their own. Well-equipped and well-trained British soldiers could fire 10–12 rounds a minute. The lack of ammunition caused a lull in the defence and, in subsequent engagements with the Zulus, ammunition boxes were unscrewed in advance for rapid distribution. Numerous first hand accounts indicate ammunition was available and being supplied, including Smith-Dorrien's earliest <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>letter</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> father.|$|E

Nevertheless, Ludwig regretted Bavaria's loss of independence and refused to attend Wilhelm's 10 January proclamation as German Emperor in the Palace of Versailles.

His people were {{not familiar with the}} Talmud and did not observe Hanukkah, but their canon contained the book of Esther and they had an oral interpretation of the Torah. Ferrara further recorded that they had their own language, that the journey from their land lasted six months, and that the biblical Gozan river was found within their borders.|$|E
