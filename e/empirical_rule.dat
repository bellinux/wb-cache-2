2500|$|If the {{population}} of interest is approximately normally distributed, the standard deviation provides information on the proportion of observations above or below certain values. For example, the average height for adult men in the United States is about 70inches (177.8cm), {{with a standard deviation}} of around 3inches (7.62cm). This means that most men (about 68%, assuming a normal distribution) have a height within 3inches (7.62cm) of the mean (67–73inches (170.18–185.42cm))one standard deviationand almost all men (about 95%) have a height within 6inches (15.24cm) of the mean (64–76inches (162.56–193.04cm))two standard deviations. If the standard deviation were zero, then all men would be exactly 70inches (177.8cm) tall. If the standard deviation were 20inches (50.8cm), then men would have much more variable heights, with a typical range of about 50–90inches (127–228.6cm). Three standard deviations account for 99.7% of the sample population being studied, assuming the distribution is normal (bell-shaped).

40|$|Abstract-In {{the mobile}} ad hoc networks(MANET), one basic {{problem is that}} some nodes are unable to {{communicate}} with certain nodes because they are disconnected at the graph level even when a strong routing protocol has been imposed. Thus, connectivity {{is an important factor}} affecting the performance of MANETs. The connectivity is related to many factors of the MANET scenario. In this paper, we investigate how the connectivity is related to the region of interest, the number of nodes, and the transmission radius of the nodes. Firstly, we propose the modeling of the MANET connectivity problem for rectangular and square covering scenarios. From these models and associated <b>empirical</b> <b>rules,</b> we present schemes to normalize these two scenarios. We also propose to use second-order polynomial equations for modeling different connectivity levels. The coefficients of these equations are explicitly estimated by the least-square method. Applications of these equations to solve typical connectivity-related problems are discussed. Finally, the precisions of these equations for estimating connectivity are evaluated, which show that the proposed <b>empirical</b> <b>rules</b> are practical and useful. These <b>empirical</b> <b>rules</b> are proposed as simple guidelines for deploying MANETs and sensor networks. I...|$|R

30|$|Another {{important}} control {{problem for}} underwater vehicles concerns {{the ability to}} achieve efficient motion with preferably a minimum amount of consumed energy {{in order to be}} able to undertake longer missions. Hence, for the long-term autonomy of underwater vehicles, energy efficiency is one of the main challenges. Preliminary results on this were presented in [46 – 48]. In particular, in [46], the relationships between the parameters of the gait patterns, the consumed energy, and the forward velocity for different motion patterns for underwater snake robots were investigated. In addition, <b>empirical</b> <b>rules</b> were proposed in order to choose the most efficient motion pattern. In [47], a simulation study was undertaken in order to compare the power consumption of swimming snake robots with that of today’s benchmark solution for subsea inspection, maintenance and repair, which are ROVs. The presented simulation results showed that an underwater snake robot is more energy efficient than a ROV for all the compared motion modes. Furthermore, [48] proposed a multiobjective optimization scheme to obtain optimal gait parameters for underwater snake robots. The proposed optimization method constitutes a general tool to investigate the motion efficiency of different dynamic models of swimming snake robots controlled by sinusoidal motion patterns. To our knowledge, however, no research has been published investigating experimentally the power consumption of underwater snake robots. To this end, in this paper we investigate experimentally the validity of the <b>empirical</b> <b>rules</b> proposed in [46, 47] regarding the relationship between the gait parameters, the velocity and the power consumption. Note that while the derivation of the <b>empirical</b> <b>rules</b> proposed in [46, 47] are based on simulation studies, this paper investigates the validity of the properties through experiments using a physical underwater snake robot [24]. The experimental results are seen to support the <b>empirical</b> <b>rules</b> proposed in [46, 47] regarding the relationship between the gait parameters, the velocity and the power consumption for both lateral undulation and eel-like motion patterns.|$|R

However, the fact that the fathers have large perimeters explains the degradation of performance for region queries. This is consistent with the analytical formulas for R-tree performance.
