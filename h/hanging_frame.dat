50|$|This work first {{appeared}} as a performance and installation by → ↑ → in 1980 at the George Paton Gallery called “Asphixiation: What is This Thing Called ‘Disco’?”. It featured large screen printed reproductions of fashion magazines and several plinths with instruments, tape players and <b>hanging</b> <b>frames,</b> all lit with neon. The performance involved the group miming to a disco album they made, the reel-to-reel visibly playing, and was recorded by David Chesworth from Essendon Airport, the album itself written in five days. An executive from Missing Link Records saw this show and approached the group about doing a single, {{to see if it}} would be a breakthrough hit like they had the previous year with The Flying Lizards “Money”. If this was successful they would put out the whole album. The single was for the song “L’Acrostique D’Amour” with the b-side “The Crush” and was released under the name Asphixiation. Seemingly the records did not sell enough, so the album was released on Philip Brophy and Chesworth’s label Innocent, with the single repressed by Innocent and packaged with the album. The project was focused on what Brophy saw as a phenomenon of disco being used to market a whole range of consumer products, tied to its ongoing commercialisation in mainstream music.|$|R

Selpin's close friend and the co-writer of the script, Walter Zerlett-Olfenius, reported him to the Gestapo, and Selpin was promptly arrested and personally questioned by Joseph Goebbels, who was {{the driving force behind the}} Titanic project. Selpin, however, did not retract his statement [...] - [...] infuriating Goebbels, since the Propaganda Minister had personally chosen Selpin to direct his propaganda epic. Within 24 hours of his arrest, Selpin was found hanged in his jail cell, which was ruled a suicide. However, in reality, Goebbels had arranged for Selpin to be hanged and the <b>hanging</b> <b>framed</b> as a suicide. The cast and crew were angry at the attempt to cover up Selpin's obvious murder and attempted to retaliate, but Goebbels countered them by issuing a proclamation stating that anyone who shunned Zerlett-Olfenius, who had reported Selpin, would answer to him personally. The unfinished film, on which the production costs were spiraling wildly out of control, was in the end completed by an uncredited Werner Klingler.|$|R

40|$|Rachael Howard {{designs and}} makes {{colourful}} and imaginative screen-printed, appliquéd and embroidered narrative wall <b>hangings,</b> <b>framed</b> works, and interior and fashion accessories. All {{are based on}} sketches of people, their postures, expressions and movements, and communicate Rachael's fascination with everyday life. Her work {{has been described as}} "witty, lively, intriguing, decorative, fresh and economically executed". Howard's designs focus on the innocent and domestic pleasures of living, such as cooking, eating, gardening and swimming. As she explains, "everyday goings-on attract me. I find it fascinating to watch what people do, the rituals they follow, like opening their deck-chairs and having a flask of coffee". Working from drawings in her sketch book, Howard cuts out vibrant scraps of fabrics, lays them in place, and then bonds them to the cotton or linen background - the original line drawing is screen printed over the top, and details and shading are added with machine embroidery. Discussing the inspiration for her work, Howard has said: "I like recording my life, and recording everyday life is what the old needlework pieces used to do; early quilts expressed important themes in a woman's life…I appreciate the low-tech simplicity and sense of order in historic work, particularly the format of many samplers". Howard was one of the Royal College of Art's first six embroidery postgraduates in 1992, and has exhibited at the Geffrye Museum in the past. 'Rachael Howard - Contemporary Textiles' will be held in the Geffrye's design centre, a gallery which promotes the work of the most talented designer-makers in East London by showing their products to a wider audience and helping their businesses to grow.

40|$|Title from PDF {{of title}} page, viewed on January 25, 2016 Thesis advisor: Rochelle ZiskinVitaIncludes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 71 - 76) Thesis (M. A.) [...] Department of Art and Art History. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2015 English embroideries {{in the seventeenth}} century frequently depict biblical narratives that feature examples of proper female behavior. Produced by young girls and women, they were made to adorn the embroiderer’s home in the form of wall <b>hangings,</b> <b>framed</b> pictures, and trinket boxes. In this thesis, I focus on embroideries produced {{from the beginning of the}} seventeenth century through the end of the Commonwealth (1600 - 1660). I assess the social, economic, and political climate of the time period, then turn to the surviving embroideries and pattern books from which the female domestic embroiderers drew. I argue that through the embroidery subjects we are sometimes able to identify the embroiderer’s economic status, religion, and even political convictions. Girlhood education and contemporary expectations of women’s behavior are essential to the place of embroidery as a valued art form produced in the home. Behavioral guidelines and pamphlets from the period have survived and prove that the education of most women was focused on how to become proper housewives. Biblical narratives were commonly represented. The story of Esther in particular was used as a lesson in morality because of her docility, loyalty, obedience, and sacrifice. Both the practice of performing the task of embroidery, which had become a tool in itself to produce well-behaved women, and the subject matter of praiseworthy biblical heroines played a role in shaping the young English girls for their future role as wives and mothers.

50|$|Vening Meinesz then {{designed}} a new gravimeter, which the KNMI (Royal Dutch Meteorological Institute) built. The apparatus has two pendula {{of the same}} size <b>hanging</b> in a <b>frame</b> but moving in opposite phases. With mirrors and lightbeams the difference in amplitude of the two pendula is captured on a film. Vening Meinesz had discovered that horizontal accelerations (as by waves on a boat) had no influence on the difference in amplitude between the two pendula. The recorded difference then is the amplitude of a theoretical, undisturbed pendulum. Now it became possible to measure gravity more accurately. Vening Meinesz started with measuring gravity all over the Netherlands, for which a network of 51 monitoring stations was created. This became a success, which encouraged him to do measurements at sea. A perfected gravimeter, hanging in a 'swing', was designed. The experiment was successful.|$|R

In 1958 Orgelbaumeister Hans Theodor Vleugels (born 1931) took over Maximilian Bader's workshop {{and two years}} later his brother's Wilhelm Bader. From 1960 to 1966 Paul Mund and Hans Theodor Vleugels led the company together. In 1967 Hans Theodor Vleugels founded the Orgelbau-Vleugels GmbH. While following traditional south German models, the company initially built instruments incorporationg modern technologies such as electric stop action. Cases had very contemporary designs, such as the organ in Cologne-Gremberg, set on a mushroom-shaped concrete pedestal, or in another organ that has free <b>hanging</b> steel <b>frame</b> with plexiglass used for the swell box and rollerboards, thus enabling a free view into the workings of the instrument. During the 1970s the firm abandoned the use of tropical woods and laminates in favour of solid woods, and electric action likewise was discarded in favor of mechanical action. While continuing to build new organs in the 1980s the firm began to devote attention to the restoration of older instruments, including organs of the South German Baroque, and Romantic instruments with valve chests and pneumatic actions. in 1988 the company moved into a large, open, and modern shop; that same year, Hans-Georg Vleugels (born in Stuttgart in 1958) became director of the firm. In 1991 Hans-Georg Vleugels took over the company chair and currently runs the company together with his son Johannes D.C. Vleugels (born 1983) {{in the second and third}} generation.
