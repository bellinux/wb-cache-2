40|$|<b>Immersed</b> <b>flame</b> arresters {{are used}} in the {{chemical}} industry for gas explosion protection. The explosive gas passes a water layer thus establishing arc-through safety up to a certain gas flow velocity. This flow velocity limit value can be considerably increased by use of an air lift loop-type bubble column with suspended solid particles in the water layer. By the suspension the distance between the individual gas bubbles is increased. Considering the gas bubble distance, a simple connection between the safety engineering characteristics laminar frame propagation velocity and normal split width at one hand and the limit gas velocity at the other hand has been foundSIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: ZN 737 (291) / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekBundesministerium fuer Forschung und Technologie (BMFT), Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristic}} of swirling flames {{produced by a}} rotating double concentric burner is described. The effect of rotational speed, mixture ratio and mixture velocity on the shape, dynamics and height of premixed flames is studied. The effect of tube rotational speed, fuel velocity, annular air velocity and nozzle geometry on the {{characteristic of}} nonpremixed flame is also described. The emphasis of this investigation is {{on the study of}} the influence of burner rotation on the form of the premixed and nonpremixed flames. It is shown that for premixed flame as the angular velocity of rotation increases with low and moderate velocity it buckles. Buckling becomes more prominent as the angular velocity increases and eventually the flame enters the burner. At sufficiently high rotational speeds, flame stabilization on top of the burner rim becomes impossible and the flame enters into the tube, i. e. <b>immersed</b> <b>flame.</b> Rotation shortens the flame and causes the flame to stabilize at a position nearer to the nozzle exit. Lean premixed-flames studies are conducted for low, moderate and high velocity mixtures. In low jet velocities, as the burner tube starts to rotate, the flame shape is dramatically altered. Th...|$|E

50|$|When aarti is performed, the {{performer}} faces the deity of God (or divine element, e.g. Ganges river) and {{concentrates on the}} form of God by looking {{into the eyes of}} the deity (it is said that eyes are the windows to the soul) to get <b>immersed.</b> The <b>flame</b> of the aarti illuminates the various parts of the deity so that {{the performer}} and onlookers may better see and concentrate on the form. Aarti is waved in circular fashion, in clockwise manner around the deity. After every circle (or second or third circle), when Aarti has reached the bottom (6-8 o'clock position), the performer waves it backwards while remaining in the bottom (4-6 o'clock position) and then continues waving it in clockwise fashion. The idea here is that aarti represents our daily activities, which revolves around God, a center of our life. Looking at God while performing aarti reminds the performer (and the attendees of the aarti) to keep God at the center of all activities and reinforces the understanding that routine worldly activities are secondary in importance. This understanding would give the believers strength to withstand the unexpected grief and keeps them humble and remindful of God during happy moments. Apart from worldly activities aarti also represents one's self - thus, aarti signifies that one is peripheral to Godhead or divinity. This would keep one's ego down and help one remain humble in spite of high social and economic rank. A third commonly held understanding of the ritual is that aarti serves as a reminder to stay vigilant so that the forces of material pleasures and desires cannot overcome the individual. Just as the lighted wick provides light and chases away darkness, the vigilance of an individual can keep away the influence of the material world.|$|R
30|$|As heat {{transfer}} {{is first and}} foremost dependent on a temperature difference, greater temperature differences will result in greater heat flux. In a compartment fire, the highest temperatures are present at those locations where flaming combustion is occurring. The fire plume and the various heat fluxes generated by it are one of the primary means of damage production {{in the early stages of}} a fire due to this great temperature difference and highly turbulent flows. Fire plumes against wall surfaces have shown to have moderate heat fluxes ranging from 40 to 80  kW/m 2, while heat fluxes measured in tests with objects <b>immersed</b> in diffusion <b>flames</b> range between 75 and 200  kW/m 2 Heskestad (1982); (Qian and Saito 1992; Dillon 1998; Lattimer 2008). Incident heat flux to wall, floor, or ceiling surfaces is dependent on the HRR of the fuel and standoff distance between the flame plume and the surface of interest. The greater the distance between the base of the plume and the surface of the wall or content surface will result in a substantially decreased heat flux to the surface (Qian and Saito 1992). Saito (1993); Williamson, et al. (1991) witnessed a 50 – 70  % decrease in peak heat flux values when small standoff distances (0.05 – 0.25  m) were employed.|$|R
40|$|Combustion {{stabilization}} and enhancement of the flammability limits are mandatory objectives to improve nowadays combustion chambers. At this purpose, {{the use of}} an electric field in the flame region provides a solution which is, at the same time, easy to implement and effective to modify the flame structure. The present work describes an efficient flamelet progress-variable approach developed to model the fluid dynamics of <b>flames</b> <b>immersed</b> in an electric field. The main feature of this model is that it can use complex ionization mechanisms without increasing the computational cost of the simulation. The model {{is based on the assumption}} that the combustion process is not directly influenced by the electric field and has been tested using two chemi-ionization mechanisms of different complexity in order to examine its behavior with and without the presence of heavy anions in the mixture. Using a one- and two-dimensional numerical test cases, the present approach has been able to reproduce all the major aspects encountered when a flame is subject to an imposed electric field and the main effects of the different chemical mechanisms. Moreover, the proposed model is shown to produce a large reduction in the computational cost, being able to shorten the time needed to perform a simulation up to 40 times.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to predict the structure of ions generated in methane flames. These simulations might lead {{to a better understanding of}} the interactions between ions in hydrocarbon flames. It was thought that such an understanding could lead to technology for electrically controlling combustion processes, formation of soot, and heat transfer;The reaction mechanisms used in this study was for a methane or hydrogen/methane flame. It contains reactions for the oxidation of fuels, chemiionization, ion-molecule reactions, and dissociative recombination. A computer model was developed to evaluate the formation of ions based on the proposed reaction mechanism;The computer code developed solved the governing equations of a laminar, premixed, one-dimensional <b>flame</b> <b>immersed</b> in an electric field. It included an iterative method that employed time splitting and finite difference techniques. Time dependent forms of the governing equations were solved until the solution relaxed to steady state;The saturation currents predicted by this model were used to determine the effective activation energies for the ionic phenomena. These values were successfully compared to experimental data. The activation energies were then compared to the values in the reaction mechanism. This led to the prediction of the ionic structure in methane flames;It appears that the depletion of the ions in the flame was by the recombination reaction H[subscript] 3 O[superscript]+ + e[superscript]- → H + H[subscript] 2 O. It was also demonstrated that C[subscript] 2 H[subscript] 3 O[superscript]+ + H[subscript] 2 → H[subscript] 3 O[superscript]+ + C[subscript] 2 H[subscript] 2 was the rate limiting reaction in determining saturation currents. The activation energy for this reaction was found to be in agreement with the value predicted using the saturation currents...|$|R
40|$|An {{ionization}} {{signal was}} detected when a flashlamp-pumped dye laser was tuned on resonance with various one- or two-photon transitions of Na atoms in an H 2 [...] -O 2 [...] -Ar flame of 1800 K at atmospheric pressure. Ionization signals {{were obtained by}} collecting the electric charge with two thin iridium probes which were <b>immersed</b> into the <b>flame.</b> Relative ionization signals were measured {{as a function of}} dc probe voltage, laser tuning, Na-solution concentration, and free-O 2 concentration. Fluorescence signals served to monitor the relative populations of the higher Na levels. A preliminary qualitative interpretation is given on the basis of collisional ionization from the saturated as well as the higher levels, which are mutually connected by population redistribution. With the assumption of a quasi-steady-state ionization, an effective Saha equation is derived, which connects the concentration of the atoms in the saturated level with the ionic concentration by an effective ionization constant. Values of this constant were estimated from the experiments and compared for the different excitation modi investigated. Additional one-photon wing excitation of the 3 P– 5 S transition might play a role as an intermediate step in the ion production when the 3 P level is saturated. The presence of excess O 2 molecules enhances the degree of ionization, whereas the addition of comparable quantities of N 2 molecules does not have this effect. This is explained by the positive electron affinity of O 2, which shifts the effective ionization equilibrium. The role of multiphoton processes which directly transfer Na atoms from the 3 S or 3 P state to the continuum state is shown to be negligible. Also the role played by the associative ionization reaction: Na(3 P) + Na(3 P) → Na 2 + + e− is shown to be negligible under our experimental conditions...|$|R
