5000|$|Orbit {{fans are}} fans that use a {{mechanism}} to oscillate at 360 degrees. They are also typically flushed to the ceiling like hugger type fans. They are also very small in size, usually about 16" [...] and have a similar construction to that of many <b>pedestal</b> <b>fans</b> and desk fans, and usually have finger guards. These are once again, popular mostly {{in many developing countries}} as they are a cheap alternative to traditional paddle type ceiling fans. Many American manufacturers, such as [...] "Fanimation" [...] have started producing high quality designer versions of such fans for their retro design, however, unlike the orbit huggers discussed earlier, these usually include downrods, like many early versions of the orbit fan.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s, Dualit {{began to}} develop {{different}} products to add to its portfolio. Still manufacturing for the commercial market, this began {{with the introduction of}} a waffle iron and continued to include sandwich toasters, soup kettles and cocktail shakers. The 1970s saw Dualit Toasters start to become more popular in domestic kitchens, but it wasn’t until the 1980s that demand in this area soared. Dualit diversified its product range to include kitchen appliances such as blenders, juicers and non-kitchen products like <b>pedestal</b> <b>fans</b> and hand dryers. Dualit still produce a comprehensive range of catering products, together with several toaster and kettle collections, a food preparation range and coffee and tea machines. Their latest development has been producing their own range of beverage capsules for coffee machines.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To pilot an in-home unintentional injury hazard {{assessment}} tool and to quantify potential injury risks {{for young children}} in a low-income urban setting. METHODS: Two low-income neighbourhoods in Karachi, Pakistan, were mapped, and families {{with at least one}} child between the ages of 12 and 59 months were identified. Using existing available home injury risk information, an in-home injury risk assessment tool was drafted and tailored to the local setting. Home injury assessments were done in June-July 2010 after obtaining informed consent. RESULTS: Approximately 75. 4 % of mothers were educated through at least grade 12. The main risks identified were stoves within the reach of the child (n= 279, 55. 5 %), presence of open buckets in the bathroom (n= 240, 47. 7 %) within the reach of the child, and <b>pedestal</b> <b>fans</b> accessible to the child (n= 242, 48. 1 %). In terms of safety equipment, a first-aid box with any basic item was present in 70 % of households, but only 4. 8 % of households had a fire extinguisher in the kitchen. CONCLUSIONS: This {{was the first time that}} an in-home, all-unintentional injury risk assessment tool was tailored and applied in the context of a low-income community in Pakistan. There was a significant burden of hazards present in the homes in these communities, representing an important opportunity for injury prevention. This pilot may have future relevance to other LMICs where child injury prevention is a critical need...|$|R
40|$|Performances of <b>pedestal</b> <b>fans</b> were {{analysed}} through experimental {{measurements of}} the induced flow field (velocity distribution) and the power consumption by {{two different types of}} fans. A test rig was constructed to facilitate the measurement of axial flow velocities in the three dimensional space. In order to predict the jet pattern produced by the fan, axial velocity distributions on sufficient number of planes were measured. These data were used to calculate the jet diameter, flow rate, kinetic energy and the linear momentum of the flow at different planes from the rotor. The power consumption and the angular speed of the rotor for each regulator setting were also measured. The velocity distributions measured on different planes from the rotor clearly illustrate the general characteristics of the flow generated by free flow fans, including the reverse flow near the rotor plane, jet entrainment and diffusion. The results show that the overall energy efficiency of a fan depends critically on its speed (i. e. regulator setting); efficiency increases with the speed. The results also indicate that the service factor defined by the flow rate at a specified section divided by the power consumption is not a suitable performance index for free-flow fans. Even with a similar axial velocity profile generated by two different fans could result in two different jet developments leading to completely different flow characteristics and performances. The {{results of the present study}} indicate the complexity of the jet development and the necessity for detailed experimental {{measurements of the}} flow velocity distribution including the swirl components in predicting performance of free-flow fans...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the hover}} {{capability}} of rotary wing Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs), {{it is of}} interest to improve their aerodynamic performance, and hence hover endurance (or payload capability). In this research, a shrouded rotor conguration is studied and implemented, {{that has the potential}} to oer two key operational benets: enhanced system thrust for a given input power, and improved structural rigidity and crashworthiness of an MAV platform. The main challenges involved in realising such a system for a lightweight craft are: design of a lightweight and stiff shroud, and increased sensitivity to external flow disturbances that can affect flight stability. These key aspects are addressed and studied in order to assess the capability of the shrouded rotor as a platform of choice for MAV applications. A fully functional shrouded rotor vehicle (disk loading 60 N/m 2) was designed and constructed with key shroud design variables derived from previous studies on micro shrouded rotors. The vehicle weighed about 280 g (244 mm rotor diameter). The shrouded rotor had a 30 % increase in power loading in hover compared to an unshrouded rotor. Due to the stiff, lightweight shroud construction, a net payload benefit of 20 - 30 g was achieved. The different components such as the rotor, stabilizer bar, yaw control vanes and the shroud were systematically studied for system efficiency and overall aerodynamic improvements. Analysis of the data showed that the chosen shroud dimensions was close to optimum for a design payload of 250 g. Risk reduction prototypes were built to sequentially arrive at the nal conguration. In order to prevent periodic oscillations in flight, a hingeless rotor was incorporated in the shroud. The vehicle was successfully flight tested in hover with a proportional-integral-derivative feedback controller. A flybarless rotor was incorporated for efficiency and control moment improvements. Time domain system identification of the attitude dynamics of the flybar and flybarless rotor vehicle was conducted about hover. Controllability metrics were extracted based on controllability gramian treatment for the flybar and flybarless rotor. In edgewise gusts, the shrouded rotor generated up to 3 times greater pitching moment and 80 % greater drag than an equivalent unshrouded rotor. In order to improve gust tolerance and control moments, rotor design optimizations were made by varying solidity, collective, operating RPM and planform. A rectangular planform rotor at a collective of 18 deg was seen to offer the highest control moments. The shrouded rotor produced 100 % higher control moments due to pressure asymmetry arising from cyclic control of the rotor. It was seen that the control margin of the shrouded rotor increased as the disk loading increased, which is however deleterious in terms of hover performance. This is an important trade-off that needs to be considered. The flight performance of the vehicle in terms of edgewise gust disturbance rejection was tested in a series of bench top and free flight tests. A standard table fan and an open jet wind tunnel setup was used for bench top setup. The shrouded rotor had an edgewise gust tolerance of about 3 m/s while the unshrouded rotor could tolerate edgewise gusts greater than 5 m/s. Free flight tests on the vehicle, using VICON for position feedback control, indicated the capability of the vehicle to recover from gust impulse inputs from a <b>pedestal</b> <b>fan</b> at low gust values (up to 3 m/s) ...|$|R
