Harmonic constants of 170 tidal constituents were obtained from harmonic analysis of the first year’s data. The results of the eight main constituents showed good agreement with those of two tidal models. Tidal characteristics, such as tide type, <b>diurnal</b> <b>inequality,</b> tidal range, and water levels were also analyzed...|$|E
30|$|The tide changes {{twice a day}} in Gomso Bay {{with almost}} no <b>diurnal</b> <b>inequality.</b> The mean range is 433.8  cm (spring: 589.8  cm, neap: 277.8  cm) and the maximum range reaches 717.4  cm (Chang et al. 2007). The semidiurnal flood current {{velocity}} is 115  cm/s in Gomso Bay, and the ebb current is 150  cm/s; thus, the ebb flow {{tends to be more}} dominant (Ryang and Shon 2003). The intertidal zone is made up of sand (S), silty sand (zS), sandy silt (sZ), and silt (Z) that become finer toward the coast. This is probably a result of changes to the hydrodynamic conditions resulting from human activities (Chang et al. 2007).|$|E
40|$|As devices {{move from}} {{full-scale}} prototype to commercial installations, {{it is important}} that developers have detailed knowledge of the tidal energy resource. Therefore, the spatial distribution of the tidal currents over the northwest European shelf seas has been examined to improve understanding of the tidal-stream energy resource. Using a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model (ROMS) at â�¼ 1 km spatial resolution, and applying device characteristics of the Seagen-S turbine, we show that the ratio of the amplitudes of the M 2 and S 2 tidal currents can lead to significant variability in annual practical power generation â�� variability that is not accounted for when considering only the mean peak spring tidal velocities, as is generally the case in resource feasibility studies. In addition, we show that <b>diurnal</b> <b>inequalities</b> (governed by K 1 and O 1 tidal constituents) and tidal asymmetries (governed by the relationship between M 2 and its compound tide M 4) over the northwest European shelf seas can further affect power generation at potential high-energy sites. Based on these variabilities, the spatial distribution of the tidal-stream â��capacity factorâ�� has been calculated. We find that mean peak spring tidal velocities can under-estimate the resource by up to 25 %, and that annual practical power generation can vary by â�¼ 15 % for regions experiencing similar mean peak spring tidal velocities, due to the influence of other tidal constituents. Therefore, even preliminary resource assessments should be based on annual average power density, rather than peak spring tidal velocity...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Oceanic {{intrusions}} of dense, hypoxic water regularly {{occur at}} the entrance to Puget Sound, WA (USA), and may be significant to regional dissolved oxygen levels. Seabed observations at Admiralty Inlet from 2009 to 2013 show a strong correlation of low dissolved oxygen concentrations with high salinity, coincident with landward bottom residual currents. Intrusions of dense water to Puget Sound are likely related to estuarine exchange flows expected to occur during conditions for minimal tidal mixing. Observations agree with minimal mixing occurring during neap tides and maximum <b>diurnal</b> <b>inequalities.</b> Tidal conditions alone cannot predict intrusions of hypoxic ocean water to Puget Sound. Coastal upwelling and Fraser River discharge influence the availability of dense, hypoxic water outside of Puget Sound, likely due to the larger-scale exchange flow in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. This large-scale process adds a strong seasonal and interannual modulation to the intrusions of hypoxic water. This thesis develops a method to diagnose hypoxic intrusion events at Admiralty Inlet. The method is based, empirically, on seabed observations, but its application relies on operational data products. Using only tidal elevation signals and indices for coastal upwelling and river discharge, 98 % of events with dissolved oxygen less than 4. 0 mg/L are identified in the 3 year record. Two-layer exchange flow conditions during intrusions are confirmed with surface observations and CTDO casts. Effects of landward propagation of hypoxic intrusions are shown to be very diffuse and more prominent in the probable cumulative response. Hypoxic water in Hood Canal cannot be directly tied to these oceanic intrusions...|$|R
30|$|The Río de la Plata Estuary is ca. 323 -km {{long and}} 230 -km wide at its mouth, {{and has a}} mean flow of 23, 000  m 3 /s and a semidiurnal {{microtidal}} regime (ranging 0.3 to 1  m) that exhibits <b>diurnal</b> <b>inequalities</b> and asymmetries (Bazán and Arriaga 1993 Guerrero et al. 1997). Two sites in the intermediate zone of the estuary were chosen: a northern one at Bagliardi Beach (34 ° 55 ′S, 57 ° 47 ′W), where the golden mussel was initially found in 1991 and where previous research on the population ecology was conducted, and a southern one at Punta Indio (35 ° 16 ′S, 57 ° 13 ′W), the southernmost limit of the species' distribution in South America and an area that experiences environmental-salinity stress. Both sites were also chosen because of the accessibility to the estuary's shore. The macrotopography is similar between sites, and they are located 90  km apart (Figure  1). At both sites, hard substrates were scarce, but a few compact granite rocks were present that had irregular surfaces and were similar in size (ca. 18, 000  cm 3), either stacked at Bagliardi Beach or scattered over a smooth slope at Punta Indio. The scarcity of hard natural substrates in the Río de la Plata Estuary had previously prevented the development of sessile or sedentary fauna until human activities began to change the coastline through creating docks and placing boulders. The latter rocks are usually used for shoreline defense and were installed by the authorities to prevent flooding under extraordinary tidal and wind conditions. Hard substrates are directly influenced by the sun (insolation) during low tides and {{are exposed to the}} mechanical action of waves at high tides (Wells and Daborn 1997). Waves are usually small (average height, 0.31  m) in the intermediate zone of the estuary, while the largest ones occur in the external zone and the smallest ones in the inner zone (Guerrero et al. 1997). Bagliardi Beach is surrounded by a long stretch of soft sand and silt, whereas the beaches around Punta Indio are composed of mud and silty clay. The hard substrates at both sites are stable and occupied by L. fortunei; it is non-indigenous and forms monospecific mussel beds. The barnacle Balanus improvisus (Darwin 1854) is the other sedentary species that is present at Punta Indio, although in much lower abundances than the golden mussel (pers. observ.); this beach constitutes the northern limit of the distribution of B. improvisus along the Argentine coastline. This barnacle was more frequently found attached to L. fortunei shells than in continuous mats on the substrate. The rocky littoral zone of the Río de la Plata Estuary does not display the classical zonation scheme characterized by different sessile species exhibited by several estuaries and marine ecosystems (Stephenson and Stephenson 1949), principally because of the river's extremely low slope and extensive beaches along its banks (Wells and Daborn 1997). The Río de la Plata Estuary has an intertidal region that is essentially defined by the respective values for mean low water, mean tidal range, and mean tide level of 0.52, 0.52, and 0.79  m at Bagliardi Beach, and 0.48, 0.68, and 0.85  m at Punta Indio (SHN 2001); these two sites are located at the borders of the estuary's intermediate salinity zone of 0.3 to 5 psu (see “Background”).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The sand ridges {{field in}} Jiangsu coastal {{area has been}} the key region of tidal flat reclamation, {{waterway}} regulation and port construction. Adopting the hydrological and sediment data in winter, the tidal patterns were revealed. In addition, the depth-averaged velocity, sediment grain size and sediment concentration in each station were analyzed and compared in detail. The result shows that the tidal in study area is regular semidiurnal and <b>diurnal</b> <b>inequality.</b> The velocity has a decreasing tendency with the Tiaozini water area being centered towards the surrounding areas. The grain size gradually decreases and then increases from north to south, while the sediment concentration gradually increases and then decreases from north to south...|$|E
40|$|Reference Model # 1 is a {{tidal turbine}} {{operating}} in a narrow, tidal channel. The site is a generalized version of Tacoma Narrows, Puget Sound, Washington. The resource is a mixed, mainly semidiurnal tidal regime with two ebbs and floods each day of unequal strength (i. e., a <b>diurnal</b> <b>inequality</b> in which a strong ebb/flood exchange {{is followed by a}} weak exchange). The diurnal inequalities provide extended windows of weak currents for device installation and maintenance activities relative to a purely semidiurnal tidal regime, though at the expense of reduced generation potential for equivalent peak currents. In order to evaluate device performance, a generalized probability distribution and vertical profile for current speeds in a mixed, mainly semidiurnal tidal regime is required. Once the distribution of velocities is known, leading‐order device performance may be evaluated based on the device operating parameters at each point on the distribution. These parameters include cut‐in speed, rated speed, and power conversion efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Specimens of {{siltstone}} beds from a roadcut in {{the lower}} member of the ~ 1. 9 Ga Pokegama Formation at the village of Midway near Virginia, Minnesota contain laminae that record possible neap-spring cycles and a strong <b>diurnal</b> <b>inequality.</b> These laminae provide support for the tidal origin of the formation proposed by R. Ojakangas (1983) {{on the basis of}} other sedimentary structures. In order to enhance observed cyclicities in the presence of significant diagenetic alteration, a new algorithm was developed that transforms digital images of lamina sequences to horizontal uniformity, and then averages them horizontally to reduce noise and enhance lamina boundaries. Although too short and noisy to provide results of appreciable confidence, spectral analysis of a lamina sequence from the Pokegama Formation suggests minimum values for the lunar orbit radius (greater than 30 earth radii) and length of day (greater than 10 hours) at the time of deposition, consistent with theoretical expectations and extrapolation of other cyclic tidal data. The analysis presented here illustrates the potential value of identifying well-preserved tidal sequences in Proterozoic sedimentary rocks of the Lake Superior region...|$|E
40|$|Island on August 8. W e {{began the}} return journey three days later, made several stops {{of a few}} days each at various places {{on the east coast}} of James Bay, and arrived back in the Moose River on September 7. The primary purpose of the trip was a study of the birds and mammals along the {{northern}} parts of the coast but, whenever possible, we set ' up a tide scale and took readings as frequently as our other work permitted. Normally, readings were taken a t irregular intervals of half an hour to four hours from about 0700 to 2100 EST. Owing to our other work it was not practicable to take night readings. Lack of these is not of great conse-quence north of the Paint-hills Islands, as the tide there is of the synodic type with relatively small diurnal inequalities. South of the Paint-hills Islands, however, and particularly in the Moar Bay area, where the tide appears to be primarily declinational with a marked <b>diurnal</b> <b>inequality</b> and a small range, apparently much affected by the wind, the height and time of the night tides is doubtful...|$|E

Data analysis shows that the occurrence of the distinct internal wave packet is closely related with the occurrence of lower-high internal tides; the internal tides are mixed in the experimental area and, thus, there is <b>diurnal</b> <b>inequality</b> between the heights of two neighboring internal tides. Modeling of internal tides and internal solitary waves in a shoaling situation suggests that this type of wave packet can be generated in the South China Sea by the large shoaling of internal solitary waves and internal tides. Both the internal solitary waves and the internal tides come from the direction of Luzon Strait. The initial large internal solitary waves contribute to the occurrence of the largest internal solitary wave {{in the middle of the}} packet and the waves behind the largest internal solitary wave, while the shoaling internal tides bring about the nonlinear internal waves in front of the largest internal solitary wave via interaction with the local shelf topography...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of GeologyAllen W. ArcherTurnagain Arm is the hypertidal (commonly {{exceeding}} 9 m) west-east trending {{extension of}} Cook Inlet in south-central Alaska. The inlet formed from a drowned glacial valley that was subsequently filled with tidal deposits of silt and fine sand. The tidal system is semidiurnal with a prominent <b>diurnal</b> <b>inequality.</b> There are also variations due to spring and neap tides. Turnagain Arm {{is home to}} a tidal bore generated during spring tides that can reach heights of up to 2 m and travel at speeds of up to 5 m/s. Current reversals can be dramatic with ebb tidal velocities of 6 m/s changing to flood velocities of 10 m/s over a period of a few minutes. During the initial flood tide, highly turbid water can rise as fast as 10 cm/min. This combination of elements results in a highly dynamic depositional setting. Measurements taken in the inner estuary during several neap-spring cycles in the summers of 2007 - 08 documented deposition upon mud bars of as much as 8. 9 cm per tidal event. Conversely, erosion of up to 13. 5 cm per tidal event has been measured. The highest rates of deposition and erosion occurred during the spring tides while much lower rates occur during the neap tides. Some portions of the inner estuary are only submerged during the extreme high tides. The magnitude of the high tide needed to cover each site increases with increasing distance into the upper estuary. Even if submerged, deposition does not always occur. Such a high percentage of non-depositional events has real implications when interpreting tidal cyclicity of the rhythmites found at these sites...|$|E
40|$|Four oceanographic {{moorings}} {{were deployed}} in the South China Sea from April 2005 to June 2006 along a transect extending from the Batanes Province, Philippines in the Luzon Strait to just north of Dong-Sha Island on the Chinese continental slope. The purpose of the array was to observe and track large-amplitude nonlinear internal waves (NIWs) from generation to shoaling {{over the course of}} one full year. The basin and slope moorings observed velocity, temperature (T) and salinity (S) at 1 – 3 min intervals to observe the waves without aliasing. The Luzon mooring observed velocity at 15 min and T and S at 3 min, primarily to resolve the tidal forcing in the strait. The observed waves travelled WNW towards 282 – 288 degrees with little variation. They were predominantly mode- 1 waves with orbital velocities exceeding 100 cm s− 1 and thermal displacements exceeding 100 m. Consistent with earlier authors, two types of waves were observed: the a-waves arrived diurnally and had a rank-ordered packet structure. The b-waves arrived in between, about an hour later each day similar to the pattern of the semi-diurnal tide. The b-waves were weaker than the a-waves, usually consisted of just one large wave, and were often absent in the deep basin, appearing as NIW only upon reaching the continental slope. The propagation speed of both types of waves was 323 ± 31 cm s− 1 in the deep basin and 222 ± 18 cm s− 1 over the continental slope. These speeds were 11 – 20 % faster than the theoretical mode- 1 wave speeds for the observed stratification, roughly consistent with the additional contribution from the nonlinear wave amplitude. The observed waves were clustered {{around the time of the}} spring tide at the presumed generation site in the Luzon Strait, and no waves were observed at neap tide. A remarkable feature was the distinct lack of waves during the winter months, December 2005 through February 2006. Most of the features of the wave arrivals can be explained by the tidal variability in the Luzon Strait. The near-bottom tidal currents in the Luzon Strait were characterized by a large fortnightly envelope, large <b>diurnal</b> <b>inequality,</b> and stronger ebb (towards the Pacific) than flood tides. Within about ± 4 days of spring tide, when currents exceeded 71 cm s− 1 , the ebb tides generated high-frequency motions immediately that evolved into well-developed NIWs by the time they reached mooring B 1 in the deep basin. These waves formed diurnally and correspond to the a-waves described by previous authors. Also near spring tide, the weaker flood tides formed NIWs which took longer/further to form, usually not until they reached mooring S 7 on the upper continental slope. These waves tracked the semidiurnal tide and correspond to the b-waves described by previous authors. These patterns were consistent from March to November. During December–February, the structure of the barotropic tide was unchanged, so the lack of waves during this time is attributed to the deep surface mixed layer and weaker stratification along the propagation path in winter...|$|E
