40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{properties}} of critical sets of the <b>full</b> n-Latin <b>square</b> and related combinatorial structures including full designs, (m,n, 2) -balanced Latin rectangles and n-Latin cubes. In Chapter 3 we study known results on designs and the analogies between critical sets of the <b>full</b> n-Latin <b>square</b> and minimal defining sets of the full designs. Next in Chapter 4 we fully classify the critical sets of the full (m,n, 2) -balanced Latin square, by describing the precise structures of these critical sets from the smallest to the largest. Properties {{of different types of}} critical sets of the <b>full</b> n-Latin <b>square</b> are investigated in Chapter 5. We fully classify the structure of any saturated critical set of the <b>full</b> n-Latin <b>square.</b> We show in Theorem 5. 8 that such a critical set has size exactly equal to n³ - 2 n² - n. In Section 5. 2 we give a construction which provides an upper bound for the size of the smallest critical set of the <b>full</b> n-Latin <b>square.</b> Similarly in Section 5. 4, another construction gives a lower bound for the size of the largest non-saturated critical set. We conjecture that these bounds are best possible. Using the results from Chapter 5, we obtain spectrum results on critical sets of the <b>full</b> n-Latin <b>square</b> in Chapter 6. In particular, we show that a critical set of each size between (n - 1) ³ + 1 and n(n - 1) ² + n - 2 exists. In Chapter 7, we turn our focus to the completability of partial k-Latin squares. The relationship between partial k-Latin squares and semi-k-Latin squares is used to show that any partial k-Latin square of order n with at most (n - 1) non-empty cells is completable. As Latin cubes generalize Latin squares, we attempt to generalize some of the results we have established on k-Latin squares so that they apply to k-Latin cubes. These results are presented in Chapter 8...|$|R

We construct a one round stat-based independent biclique {{for the initial}} round, and utilize matching with precomputation techniques to recover the whole key from the remaining rounds.
