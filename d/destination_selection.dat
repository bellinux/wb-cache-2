However during the construction stage tender the VT scheme {{was replaced by}} an innovative TWIN system by ThyssenKrupp , the first elevator system to have two cabs running independently one above {{the other in the}} same shaft. This technology has many advantages over conventional elevator systems, including the fact that waiting and travel times are reduced to a minimum due to intelligent <b>destination</b> <b>selection</b> control system monitored by computer optimizing the travel logistics between calls. The use of innovative TWIN elevators saved 2 shafts within the core (10 TWINs up to 7m/sec speed instead of 12 double-deckers in the original concept with 12 double-decker elevators), freeing up an additional useful space in the building across all floors for MEP shafts. TWIN technology also contributed to the overall project sustainability with lesser power consumption per passenger (the ‘separated’ cabs in TWIN system are much lighter than double-decker cab, hence less  starting currents and resulting power consumption. The cabs are in fact similar to a single elevator production line , so the maintenance cost is less too due to availability of cheaper standard spare parts unlike in the bespoke double-deckers.|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of tour <b>destination</b> <b>selection</b> {{is dependent on}} pre-visit information sources. As competition increases in the tourism industry, destination organisations need to improve current <b>destination</b> <b>selection</b> processes. Research on current processes indicate that information sources accessed by potential tourists when making travel decisions {{may not be a}} true reflection of what the destination is offering. Any negative difference between perceived images during pre-visit and real images during the actual visit may result in poor destination reputation and dissatisfied customers. This research addresses this gap by improving the process of <b>destination</b> <b>selection</b> using a real-time data streaming mediation technique as an additional pre-visit information source. The researcher adopted a social-technologist research paradigm and a design-science approach. The research process was executed in three phases; the first phase focused on gathering knowledge on <b>destination</b> <b>selection</b> and pre-visit information sources. The findings in Phase 1 were used in Phase 2 to develop and test the performance of a prototype. Phase 3 involved the evaluation of the prototype tool in a real-world setting. One of the main outcomes of this research is the development of a <b>destination</b> <b>selection</b> framework using real-time data streaming mediation and a tool ([URL] as proof of concept. This research has shown that real-time images are valuable pre-visit information sources when making travel decisions. Real-time images authenticate destination attractions, provide real-time availability of destinations, reduce speculations on destination attractions, and provide actual representations of destinations.

The increasing popularity of Grid computing and Peer-to-Peer systems has renewed research interests in dynamic and adaptive virtual machines. Service migration is a vital technique to construct reconfigurable VMs. By incorporating mobile agent technology, VM systems can improve their resource utilization, load balancing and fault tolerance significantly via hybrid mobility of services and computational agents. This paper focuses on the decision problem of hybrid mobility for load-balancing in reconfigurable VMs. We tackle this problem from three aspects: migration candidate determination, migration timing and <b>destination</b> server <b>selection.</b> The service migration timing and <b>destination</b> server <b>selection</b> are formulated as two optimization models. We derive the optimal migration policy for heterogenous distributed systems based on stochastic optimization theories. Renewal processes are applied to model the dynamics of migration.

Our decision policy is complementary to the existing service and agent migration techniques. Its accuracy is verified by simulations...|$|R

Low-carbon tourism <b>destination</b> <b>selection</b> often involves multiple conflicting and incommensurate attributes or criteria and can be modelled as a multi-attribute decision-making problem. This paper develops a framework to solve multi-attribute group decision-making problems, where attribute evaluation values are provided as linguistic terms and the attribute weight information is incomplete. In order to obtain a group risk preference captured by a linguistic term set with triangular fuzzy semantic information, a nonlinear programming model is established on the basis of individual risk preferences. We first convert individual linguistic-term-based decision matrices to their respective triangular fuzzy decision matrices, which are then aggregated into a group triangular fuzzy decision matrix. Based on this group decision matrix and the incomplete attribute weight information, a linear program is developed to find an optimal attribute weight vector. A detailed procedure is devised for tackling linguistic multi-attribute group decision making problems.

This research provides, through a focus on the sport of golf, insight into the characteristics of the sports tourist, how participation is included in trips, how the emotional rewards gained from participation can influence sports tourist behaviours, and thus influence the selection of locations deemed suitable for sports participation.

The research employs a grounded theory methodology, underpinned by a constructivist epistemology. This informed the process used to gather and analyse data as well as the presentation of this thesis. Three iterations of data (presented as discrete chapters) provide a robust analysis of literature and the twenty-seven interviews with UK-based golf tourists.

A stall is where an SCTP end-point ceases to communicate {{for an extended}} period of time, but does not report any error to the upper layer. This paper presents two different sets of circumstances where a stall can occur: firstly when there is an underestimation of the Retransmission Time-Out (RTO) value for a redundant network path; and secondly when a network error occurs that causes only SACKs to be lost, which confuses the SCTP sender about which network path is operational. Solutions to both of these stalls are presented that include modifying the RTO value, applying Karn’s algorithm to path monitoring and ensuring the <b>destination</b> address <b>selection</b> policy for SACKs is changed. This paper also presents a mechanism to de-couple data acknowledgement and path monitoring when using multi-homed transport protocols, which should remove the ambiguity about path monitoring and offers a universal solution to the stall.
