25|$|Paul Gilroy and Alexander Weheliye {{state that}} unlike disco, jazz, R, house music, and other genres that were {{developed}} in the African-American community and which were quickly adopted and then increasingly controlled by white music <b>industry</b> <b>executives,</b> hip hop has remained largely controlled by African American artists, producers and executives. In his book, Phonographies, Weheliye describes the political and cultural affiliations that hip hop music enables. In contrast, Greg Tate states that the market-driven, commodity form of commercial hip hop has uprooted the genre from the celebration of African-American culture and the messages of protest that predominated in its early forms. Tate states that the commodification and commercialization of hip hop culture undermines the dynamism of the genre for African-American communities.|$|E
25|$|Green {{dared not}} refuse the AFL {{executive}} council's instructions {{to undertake a}} joint organizing drive, {{but he did not}} wholeheartedly implement a plan, either. For {{the first six months of}} the year, Green did nothing. After the creation of the federal Steel Labor Relations Board in late June 1935 (an independent labor relations board created by President Franklin D. Roosevelt because of the failures of the National Labor Board), Green worked with Tighe, steel <b>industry</b> <b>executives</b> and the steel board to create a plan to allow collective bargaining in the steel industry. The talks dragged on through the end of the year. The sticking point was the AFL's demand for representational exclusivity (the concept that if a majority of workers voted for the union then all employees in the bargaining unit should belong to the union).|$|E

25|$|Graden {{sent the}} film on a VHS to several <b>industry</b> <b>executives</b> in Hollywood; meanwhile, someone {{digitized}} the clip {{and put it}} up on the Internet, where it became one of the very first viral videos. As Jesus vs. Santa became more popular, Parker and Stone began talks of developing the short into a television series. Fox refused to pick up the series, not wanting to air a show that included the character Mr. Hankey, a talking piece of feces. The two were initially skeptical of possible television deals, noting that previous endeavors had not turned out successful. The two then entered negotiations with both MTV and Comedy Central. Parker preferred the show be produced by Comedy Central, fearing that MTV would turn it into a kids' show. When Comedy Central executive Doug Herzog watched the short, he commissioned the development of the show into a series.|$|E
25|$|Early in his career, {{he worked}} for various film distributors. In 1921, he {{represented}} W.A.S. Douglas who directed a film for Jawitz Pictures, entitled Watered Stock (later retitled Beware of the Law), {{in the sale of}} its domestic and international rights. By the beginning of 1924 he was working for Film Booking Offices of America (FBO). In July 1925 it was announced that he would be the head of sales at FBO, following the death of Harry Berman. In December 1925 Marcus penned an article for The Film Daily extolling the virtues of film shorts, and warning exhibitors against the dangers of overlooking the use of shorts. In 1927 Marcus was one of three film <b>industry</b> <b>executives</b> who formed a committee to produce a trailer meant to show the industry in a good light. The other members of the committee were Al Lichtman of United Artists and Edmund Grainger of 20th Century Fox. Also in 1927, Marcus continued his championing of the film short. In June he announced a list of well-known writers who would be responsible for penning the shorts for FBO. The list included cartoonists Bill Nolan and Fontaine Fox, and short story writer H. C. Witwer. Marcus began reorganizing the sales management and districts within FBO in September 1927. First he promoted his future partner, Charles Rosenzweig, to head the district overseeing FBO's New York State district, and then completely reorganized the mid-west districts. In February 1928 FBO planned a jubilee in honor of the second anniversary of Joseph Kennedy's involvement as owner of FBO. As part of that event, Marcus took the rare step of giving authority to his sales force to directly approve contracts with exhibitors.|$|E

The scenario called for the main character, whose son was killed by a boy who played violent video games, to murder a number of <b>industry</b> <b>executives</b> (including one modeled on Eibeler) and go on a killing spree at the Electronic Entertainment Expo. Video game fans promptly began working to take Thompson up on his offer, resulting in the game I'm O.K – A Murder Simulator, among others.
