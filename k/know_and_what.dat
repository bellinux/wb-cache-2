AI researchers (and futurists and science fiction writers) often {{assume that there}} is no limit to formal, scientific knowledge, because they assume that any phenomenon in the universe can be described by symbols or scientific theories. This assumes that everything that exists can be understood as objects, properties of objects, classes of objects, relations of objects, and so on: precisely those things that can be described by logic, language and mathematics. The question of what exists is called ontology, and so Dreyfus calls this the ontological assumption. If this is false, then it raises doubts about what we can ultimately <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> intelligent machines will ultimately be able to help us to do.|$|E

[...] Second to Cosby himself, Rashad is the series' most regular cast member, appearing in a total of 212 episodes. In response to television personality Oprah Winfrey quoting a common critique of the series – [...] "How is it realistic to have a doctor and a lawyer in the same house?" [...] – Rashad defended, [...] "I grew up in Houston, Texas, in Third Ward, and it was very realistic. … I guess it just depends on who you <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> you know." ...|$|E
