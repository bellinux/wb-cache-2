5|$|Fragments of {{the work}} survive, having been quoted by Lactantius, and Jerome makes note {{of the work}} in a consolatory letter to Heliodorus of Altino. A popular piece of writing until its loss, the Consolatio is widely {{accepted}} as the distinct work that transmitted the earlier consolatio literary tradition to the Romans of the late Republic. In 1583, Italian scholar Carlo Sigonio claimed to <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>a</b> non-fragmentary version of the Consolatio, although most scholars now agree that this work was either a fraud or a hoax, with modern stylometric methods seeming to back this up.|$|E
5|$|In 1583, Italian scholar Carlo Sigonio {{claimed to}} <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>a</b> non-fragmentary {{version of the}} Consolatio. While this news was met with {{excitement}} at first, scholars—after reading the work—began {{to argue that the}} manuscript was a fraud, with humanist Antonio Riccoboni being among the most vocal. However, Sigonio continued to defend the work until his death, even mentioning in two different orations his belief in the truthfulness of the text. The scholar Latino Latini, however, later claimed in a letter that Sigonio had admitted to the forgery on his deathbed. By and large, the academic community concluded that the version of the Consolatio discovered was not genuine, and the document later earned the name the Pseudo-Ciceronian Consolatio.|$|E
5|$|The Finnish {{historian}} T. I. Itkonen {{mentions that}} A.muscaria was once used among the Sami people: sorcerers in Inari would consume fly agarics with seven spots. In 1979, Said Gholam Mochtar and Hartmut Geerken {{published an article}} in which they claim to <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>a</b> tradition of medicinal and recreational use of this mushroom among a Parachi-speaking group in Afghanistan. There are also unconfirmed reports of religious use of A.muscaria among two Subarctic Native American tribes. Ojibwa ethnobotanist Keewaydinoquay Peschel reported its use among her people, where it {{was known as the}} miskwedo. This information was enthusiastically received by Wasson, although evidence from other sources was lacking. There is also one account of a Euro-American who claims to have been initiated into traditional Tlicho use of Amanita muscaria.|$|E

25|$|The Fordcroft {{cemetery}} {{contained a}} mixture of cremation and inhumation burials. The two forms of burial were interspersed within the cemetery, leading excavators {{to believe that they}} were contemporary with each other. Archaeologists <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>a</b> total of 19 cremations and 52 inhumations from the site. Due to the grave goods found at the site, Tester suggested that the site was probably active as a place of burial between circa 450 and 550 CE. He noted that culturally, the artefacts and forms of burial were similar to those found around the Thames Valley.|$|E

25|$|Recent studies <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>a</b> pathway {{that links}} stress to {{the onset of}} disease through the {{activation}} of certain genes. The experience of psychological stress activates transcription factors that activate genes.

This gene codes for a protein that activates the inflammatory response which directs an immune response {{to the site of the}} inflammation. Chronic inflammation makes an individual more susceptible to diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes.|$|E

25|$|In October 2011, a {{research}} team from ESIEA claimed to <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>a</b> way to compromise the Tor network by decrypting communication passing over it. The technique they describe requires creating {{a map of}} Tor network nodes, controlling one third of them, and then acquiring their encryption keys and algorithm seeds. Then, using these known keys and seeds, they claim the ability to decrypt two encryption layers out of three. They claim to break the third key by a statistical-based attack. In order to redirect Tor traffic to the nodes they controlled, they used a denial-of-service attack. A response to this claim has been published on the official Tor Blog stating that these rumours of Tor's compromise are greatly exaggerated.|$|E
