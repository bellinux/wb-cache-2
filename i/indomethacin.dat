25|$|Indometacin, or <b>indomethacin,</b> is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) {{commonly used}} as a prescription medication to reduce fever, pain, stiffness, and swelling from inflammation. It works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, endogenous signaling molecules known to cause these symptoms. It does this by inhibiting cyclooxygenase, an enzyme that catalyzes the production of prostaglandins.|$|E
25|$|Since a large {{percentage}} of people with SLE have varying amounts of chronic pain, stronger prescription analgesics (painkillers) may be used if over-the-counter drugs (mainly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) do not provide effective relief. Potent NSAIDs such as <b>indomethacin</b> and diclofenac are relatively contraindicated for people with SLE because they increase the risk of kidney failure and heart failure.|$|E
25|$|Indole {{undergoes}} electrophilic substitution, mainly {{at position}} 3 (see diagram in right margin). Substituted indoles are structural elements of (and for some compounds, the synthetic precursors for) the tryptophan-derived tryptamine alkaloids like the neurotransmitter serotonin, and melatonin. Other indolic compounds include the plant hormone auxin (indolyl-3-acetic acid, IAA), tryptophol, the anti-inflammatory drug <b>indomethacin,</b> the betablocker pindolol, and the naturally occurring hallucinogen dimethyltryptamine.|$|E
25|$|Inhibition of COX also {{decreases}} prostaglandins in the epithelium of the stomach, {{making it}} more sensitive to corrosion by gastric acid. This is also the main side effect of diclofenac. Diclofenac has a low to moderate preference to block the COX2-isoenzyme (approximately 10-fold) and is said to have, therefore, a somewhat lower incidence of gastrointestinal complaints than noted with <b>indomethacin</b> and aspirin.|$|E
25|$|Codeine is also {{commonly}} marketed {{in products}} containing codeine with other pain killers or muscle relaxers, {{as well as}} codeine mixed with phenacetin (Emprazil with codeine No. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5), naproxen, <b>indomethacin,</b> diclofenac, and others, {{as well as more}} complex mixtures, including such mixtures as aspirin + paracetamol + codeine ± caffeine ± antihistamines and other agents, such as those mentioned above.|$|E
25|$|Early {{long-term}} higher-dose {{therapy with}} AZT was initially associated with side effects that sometimes limited therapy, including anemia, neutropenia, hepatotoxicity, cardiomyopathy, and myopathy. All {{of these conditions}} were generally found to be reversible upon reduction of AZT dosages. They {{have been attributed to}} several possible causes, including transient depletion of mitochondrial DNA, sensitivity of the γ-DNA polymerase in some cell mitochondria, the depletion of thymidine triphosphate, oxidative stress, reduction of intracellular L-carnitine or apoptosis of the muscle cells. Anemia due to AZT was successfully treated using erythropoetin to stimulate red blood cell production. Drugs that inhibit hepatic glucuronidation, such as <b>indomethacin,</b> nordazepam, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and trimethoprim decreased the elimination rate and increased the therapeutic strength of the medication. Today, side-effects are much less common with the use of lower doses of AZT.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{individual}} analgesics rarely induce {{liver damage}} {{due to their}} widespread use, NSAIDs have emerged as a major group of drugs exhibiting hepatotoxicity. Both dose-dependent and idiosyncratic reactions have been documented. Aspirin and phenylbutazone are associated with intrinsic hepatotoxicity; idiosyncratic reaction {{has been associated with}} ibuprofen, sulindac, [...] phenylbutazone, piroxicam, diclofenac and <b>indomethacin.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... primary exertional headache: throbbing, pulsatile pain {{which starts}} {{during or after}} exercising, lasting for 5 minutes to 24 hours. The {{mechanism}} behind these headaches is unclear, possibly due to straining causing veins in the head to dilate, causing pain. These headaches can be prevented by not exercising too strenuously and can be treated with medications such as <b>indomethacin.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Prostaglandins, {{specifically}} PGE2 and PGI2, {{are important}} in inflammation and have been implicated in promoting apical resorption. [...] This is because neutrophils, which are rich sources of PGE2, are present when the majority of rapid bone loss occurs during {{the initial stages of}} apical periodontitis. [...] It has been illustrated clinically that parenteral administration of <b>indomethacin,</b> an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, can act to suppress resorption of apical hard tissue.|$|E

Clozapine users in the United States, Australia, Canada, and the UK must be nationally registered for monitoring of low WBC and absolute neutrophil counts (ANC).|$|E
2500|$|Desmopressin will be {{ineffective}} in nephrogenic DI which is treated by reversing {{the underlying cause}} (if possible) and replacing the free water deficit. The diuretic hydrochlorothiazide (a thiazide diuretic) or <b>indomethacin</b> {{can be used to}} create mild hypovolemia which encourages salt and water uptake in proximal tubule and thus improve nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Amiloride has additional benefit of blocking Na uptake. Thiazide diuretics are sometimes combined with amiloride to prevent hypokalemia. It seems paradoxical to treat an extreme diuresis with a diuretic, and the exact mechanism of action is unknown but the thiazide diuretics will decrease distal convoluted tubule reabsorption of sodium and water, thereby causing diuresis. [...] This decreases plasma volume, thus lowering the glomerular filtration rate and enhancing the absorption of sodium and water in the proximal nephron. [...] Less fluid reaches the distal nephron, so overall fluid conservation is obtained.|$|E
