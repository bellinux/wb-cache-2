50|$|A {{water-soluble}} preparation of emamectin in polysorbate, acetone, and methanol {{was shown to}} prevent the wilting of <b>Japanese</b> black <b>pine</b> trees inoculated with pine-wood nematodes (Bursaphelenchus xylophilus). Previous treatment of B. xylophilus infections involved eradicating the local population of <b>Japanese</b> <b>pine</b> sawyers associated with {{the spread of the}} nematode.|$|R
50|$|Pinus densiflora, {{also called}} Korean red <b>pine,</b> the <b>Japanese</b> <b>pine</b> or <b>Japanese</b> red <b>pine,</b> has a home range that {{includes}} Japan, the Korean Peninsula, northeastern China (Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Shandong) and the extreme southeast of Russia (southern Primorsky Krai). This pine {{has become a}} popular ornamental and has several cultivars, but in the winter it becomes yellowish. The height of this tree is 20-35 m. The <b>Japanese</b> red <b>pine</b> prefers full sun on well-drained, slightly acidic soil.|$|R
40|$|The {{nucleotide}} diversities {{and genetic}} {{relationship in the}} three <b>Japanese</b> <b>pine</b> species, P. thunbergii, P. densiflora, and P. luchuensis, were measured using low-copy anchor loci in Pinaceae. The average nucleotide diversity among these three <b>Japanese</b> <b>pines</b> revealed that P. thunbergii was the highest (6. 05 × 10 − 3), followed by P. densiflora (5. 27 × 10 − 3) and P. luchuensis (5. 02 × 10 − 3). In comparison to other conifer species, {{it was concluded that}} the pines possessed an intermediate level of nucleotide diversity. The Heat shock protein (HSP) gene in P. thunbergii, Phenylalanine tRNA synthetase, RuBP carboxylase, and Disease resistance response protein 206 genes in P. densiflora were significantly deviated from standard neutral models. Some of these genes were related to stress or pathogen/defense response. As the samples used in this study were collected from natural populations that showed specific characteristics of being resistant to pine wilt nematode, it was hypothesized that the initial selection was an important factor in discriminating the deviation from neutrality models. Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed that the three <b>Japanese</b> <b>pines</b> were split into two lineages corresponding to P. densiflora and P.  thunbergii–P. luchuensis. The latter lineage was differentiated further into two clades; P. thunbergii and P. luchuensis. The result concludes that the three <b>Japanese</b> <b>pines</b> are closely related and P. thunbergii is genetically closer to P. luchuensis, than P. densiflora...|$|R

40|$|Pathogenicity of {{the pine}} wood nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, to Japanese larch, Larix kaempferi, {{seedlings}} was tested with inoculation experiments under nursery conditions. Water suspensions of nematodes (mixed stages cultured on Botrytis cinerea or dispersal fourth-stage juveniles (DJ 4) extracted from the adult <b>Japanese</b> <b>pine</b> sawyer, Monochamus alternatus) were injected into the stems of 2 - and 3 -year-old Japanese larch and <b>Japanese</b> black <b>pine,</b> Pinus thunbergii, seedlings growing in a nursery. In another treatment, <b>Japanese</b> <b>pine</b> sawyer adults holding DJ 4 were released under a net that covered {{the upper half of}} the seedlings. Regardless of nematode inoculation method, Japanese larch seedlings were as susceptible as <b>Japanese</b> black <b>pine</b> seedlings to B. xylophilus under nursery conditions. The rate of disease development was similar on larch and pine seedlings. Nematode population densities were lower in the stems of dead larch seedlings than in the stems of dead pine seedlings. Histopathological observations revealed that the distribution of nematodes in the stems of dead larch seedlings was mostly limited to the cortex, phloem and cambial zone. Traumatic resin canal formation {{was one of the most}} characteristic symptoms in larch seedlings which was dissimilar to that in pine seedlings...|$|R

50|$|The {{nematode}} {{was first}} {{discovered in the}} timber of longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) in Louisiana, United States. Steiner and Burhrer reported that the nematode was a new species, and they named it Aphelenchoides xylophilus in 1934.In 1969, Japanese plant pathologists Tomoya Kiyohara (清原友也) and Yozan Tokushige (徳重陽山) discovered many unfamiliar nematodes on dead pine trees around the Kyushu islands in Japan.Then, they experimentally inoculated the nematode to healthy pine and other conifer trees and observed them. The healthy pine trees were killed—especially Japanese red and <b>Japanese</b> Black <b>pine.</b> However, Jack and Loblloly pine, Sugi cedar, and Hinoki cypress trees were able to survive. The researchers concluded that the nematode was the pathogen behind the increase of mortality in <b>Japanese</b> <b>pine</b> trees.|$|R

Mineral analyses of soil and foliage showed no significant differences between healthy and infested trees. B. xylolyhilus was also found on loblolly pine (P. taeda), scrub pine (P. virginiana), Scots pine (P. sylvestris), red pine (P. resinosa), Eastern white pine (P. strobus), and pitch pine (P. rigida) ...|$|R

40|$|Pine tree death {{caused by}} pine wood {{nematode}} (PWN) involves phoretic relationships between PWN and its vector <b>Japanese</b> <b>pine</b> sawyer beetle (JPS). In an effort to understand the diversity of fungi involved in PWN life cycle, a total of 176 fungal isolates were collected from PWNs, adults and larvae of JPS, PWN-diseased <b>Japanese</b> black <b>pine</b> that was cut down in 2005 at Jinju, Korea.

Three genera including Mucor, Ophiostoma, and Penicillium were identified from PWN. Two genera of Ophiostoma and Penicillium were discovered from JPS larvae. From JPS adult beetles, nine genera of Aspergillus, Gibberella, Hypocrea, Irpex, Leptosphaeria, Ophiostoma, Penicillium, and Plectosphaerella and unknown basidio-mycetes were found. Ten genera from PWN-infected wood were confirmed as Bionectria, Botrytis, Camarops, Fusarium, Hypo-crea, Nectrtia, Mucor, Ophiostoma, Penicillium, and Trichoderma.

Pine trees killed by pine wilt disease in 2008 and 2009 also occurred in loose colonies of 16 - 25 m 2 in area. However, the spatial distribution pattern of pine trees killed in 2009 was exclusive to that in 2008, and killed trees in 2009 occurred in colonies of pine trees where no killed pine trees occurred in 2008. Asymptomatic carrier trees might not have any significant impacts on the spatial pattern of killed trees.
