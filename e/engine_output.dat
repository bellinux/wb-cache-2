5|$|Lockheed {{worked on}} modifying the AH-56 design {{to address the}} {{vibration}} and other issues. As a precaution, Cheyenne #9 (s/n 66-8834) was fitted with an ejection seat for the pilot after the March accident. The downward firing ejection seat {{was placed in the}} forward seat in place of the gunner's station. This prototype would be used for all remaining envelope expansion flights. Prototype #9 also received an upgraded transmission and drivetrain, and a hinged rear canopy in place of the original sliding canopy around 1970. The new transmission allowed the T64-GE-16 turboshaft <b>engine</b> <b>output</b> to be increased from a derated 3,435horsepower (2,561kW) to 3,925horsepower (2,927kW). The new canopy eliminated the canopy vibrations.|$|E
25|$|The {{modern era}} has also seen rapidly {{improving}} fuel efficiency and <b>engine</b> <b>output.</b> The automobile emissions concerns have been eased with computerised engine management systems.|$|E
25|$|Being {{considerably}} less powerful than Rautaruukki and Steel, Herakles received new main engines and propellers in 1995. While the <b>engine</b> <b>output</b> was nearly doubled to 4060kW, she remained underpowered {{in comparison with}} the original Finnpusku pushers. She also had a lower Finnish-Swedish ice class, 1B.|$|E
50|$|This formula with linear {{forces and}} speeds {{can be used}} equally well for both <b>engines</b> <b>outputting</b> thrust and <b>engines</b> exerting torque.|$|R
50|$|Aimed at {{performance}} enthusiast {{buyers and}} featuring a new turbocharged <b>engine</b> <b>outputting</b> approximately , sports tires and wheels, and exterior paint job {{inspired by the}} company's motorcycles.|$|R
50|$|Formula Renault 2000 {{cars are}} allowed to race, but must be in BARC specification, using the 'Blue' 37mm restrictor. This ensures the cars have {{balanced}} <b>engine</b> <b>outputs.</b>|$|R
25|$|While in Europe the 1750 {{was fitted}} with two twin {{horizontal}} carburettors, starting with model year 1969 {{models for the}} North American market had SPICA (Società Pompe Iniezione Cassani & Affini, a subsidiary of Alfa Romeo) mechanical fuel injection. According to Alfa Romeo <b>engine</b> <b>output</b> and performance were unchanged from the carburetted version.|$|E
25|$|Fetters {{strongly}} {{denied that}} the design had safety issues and issued statements indicating that all accidents were due to improper maintenance, failure of builders to carry out rotor tracking and balancing or lack of piloting skills. In response to customer complaints in 1998 Fetters did add a tuned exhaust system to increase <b>engine</b> <b>output,</b> stronger transmission gears and a mast support kit to reduce vibrations.|$|E
25|$|Finnish-Swedish {{ice class}} is an ice class {{assigned}} to a vessel operating in first-year ice in the Baltic Sea and calling Finnish or Swedish ports. Ships are divided into six ice classes based on requirements for hull structural design, <b>engine</b> <b>output</b> and performance in ice according to the regulations issued by the Finnish Transport Safety Agency (TraFi), which overtook {{the responsibilities of the}} Finnish Maritime Administration in 2010, and the Swedish Maritime Administration.|$|E
50|$|With the IMA system, {{the amount}} of energy {{regeneration}} during deceleration is optimized and friction is reduced. The recovered energy is used to supplement the <b>engine's</b> <b>output</b> during acceleration.|$|R
30|$|In 2015 it was {{revealed}} that diesel Volkswagens contain software to detect when an emissions test is underway, and to decrease the <b>engine’s</b> <b>output</b> of pollutants {{for the duration of the}} test.|$|R
50|$|This is {{the reason}} why any <b>engine</b> <b>outputting</b> its power on a {{rotating}} shaft is usually quoted, along with its rated power, the rotational speed at which that rated power is developed.|$|R
25|$|Standards, {{also called}} naked bikes or roadsters, are versatile, {{general-purpose}} street motorcycles. They are recognized primarily by their upright riding position, partway between the reclining rider posture of the cruisers and the forward leaning sport bikes. Footpegs are below the rider and handlebars are {{high enough to}} not force the rider to reach too far forward, placing the shoulders above the hips in a natural position. Because of their flexibility, lower costs, and moderate <b>engine</b> <b>output,</b> standards are particularly suited to motorcycle beginners.|$|E
25|$|The 1961 Formula One season saw the {{introduction}} of radically revised engine regulations. Maximum capacity was cut from 1954-1960's 2.5 L to only , greatly reducing the power and torque available, but also bringing fuel economy and weight benefits. This change required Formula One chassis designers to rethink their approach to a car's whole construction as poor handling and excess weight {{could no longer be}} effectively compensated for by greater <b>engine</b> <b>output.</b> Cooper suffered their first season without a Championship race win since 1958, and finished only fourth in the World Constructors' Championship.|$|E
25|$|While the Finnish-Swedish ice classes can be {{assigned}} to icebreakers {{for the purpose of}} collecting fairway fees, the rules are intended primarily for merchant ships operating under icebreaker escort. Because the <b>engine</b> <b>output</b> and the level of ice-strengthening in ships designed to operate independently in ice-infested waters, especially in the presence of multi-year ice, usually exceeds the requirements of the Finnish-Swedish ice class rules, the classification societies use different ice class notations, such as the IACS Polar Class, for icebreakers. The two highest Finnish-Swedish ice classes, 1A and 1A Super, are somewhat equivalent to the two lowest Polar Classes, PC 7 and PC 6, respectively.|$|E
50|$|For the 2010 model Mitsubishi {{upped the}} {{compression}} {{ratio of the}} Outlander's 6B31 to 10.5:1. This change adds an additional ten-horsepower (230 hp total) and 11 lb-ft torque (215 lb-ft total) to the <b>engine's</b> <b>output.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2012, a pick-up {{version of}} the SAIPA Pride was introduced, called the SAIPA 151. Its <b>engine</b> <b>outputs</b> roughly 68 hp, and is capable of {{carrying}} up to 460 kilograms (380 kilograms with the LPG engine).|$|R
500|$|Being the {{flagship}} sports variant, the XR8 credited specially tuned sports suspension, seating trim displaying the [...] "XR" [...] insignia, 17-inch wheels {{and the new}} 5.4-litre Boss 260 <b>engine,</b> <b>outputting</b> 30percent more power than the previous model.|$|R
25|$|The EL {{introduced}} {{only minor}} running {{changes to the}} Falcon's base model straight-six engine, {{when compared to the}} radical overhaul presented by the EF. The coil-pack ignition system introduced in the EF was rolled back to the distributor-style ignition from the ED Falcon due to reliability problems. A divided air induction pipe which led to the throttle was replaced with a single, wider pipe. <b>Engine</b> <b>output</b> remained unchanged at 157kilowatts (211hp) and 357newton metres (263ft·lbf). In October 1997, the V8 engine fitted to the XR8 sports model was upgraded from 170kilowatts (228hp) to 185 (248hp). Torque figures were also upped from 398newton metres (294ft·lbf) to 402 (296ft·lbf).|$|E
25|$|Chevrolet {{engineered}} several modifications for the Z06 to {{best use}} the increased power. Starting {{with the most}} structurally rigid body style, the hardtop or FRC, new components included: uprated FE4 suspension, larger wheels and tires, revised gearing ratios, and functional brake cooling ducts. The Z06 is 38 pounds lighter than a standard C5 hardtop thanks to weight-saving measures such as a titanium exhaust, thinner glass, lighter wheel, non-EMT tires, reduced sound proofing, fixed rear radio aerial, and a lighter battery. Starting with the 2002 model year, the LS6 <b>engine</b> <b>output</b> was increased to 405hp (302kW) due to a larger CFM air intake, stiffer valve springs, lighter sodium filled valves and more aggressive camshaft lift and timing.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, the California Motor Company {{was formed}} in 1901 to sell {{complete}} gasoline-engine motorbikes in San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose. The company began with a 200cc single-cylinder, 1.5-horsepower, four-stroke engine designed by R.C. Marks. Mounted to a standard bicycle frame, the California could reach speeds of approximately 25mph (40km/h). The California weighed around 75-80 pounds, and featured a leading-link front fork, a leather spring saddle, a front Duck roller brake, and an Atherton rear coaster brake. A leathern belt-drive directly connected the <b>engine</b> <b>output</b> shaft to the rear wheel. During the summer of 1903, George A. Wyman rode a 200cc, 1.5-horsepower California from San Francisco to New York City, becoming {{the first person to}} cross the North American continent aboard a motor vehicle.|$|E
50|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>outputs</b> of {{this race}} car {{produced}} approximately , enabling it to reach 300 km/h with suitable gearing. It was also {{equipped with a}} specially homologated Holinger six-speed transmission, and their homologated racing weight was 1250 kg, down from the VL SV's 1325 kg.|$|R
50|$|While a {{turbojet}} engine uses {{all of the}} <b>engine's</b> <b>output</b> to produce thrust {{in the form of}} a hot high-velocity exhaust gas jet, a turbofan's cool low-velocity bypass air yields between 30% and 70% of the total thrust produced by a turbofan system.|$|R
25|$|Top {{speeds of}} over 270 mph, <b>engine</b> <b>outputs</b> of over 700 horsepower, and {{performances}} in the standing quarter mile as quick as 6.9 seconds and as fast as 209.14 mph have been recorded by street registered Hayabusa motorcycles using standard-width (190mm) DOT-approved street-legal rear tires.|$|R
25|$|All 567 engines utilize forced induction, {{with either}} a Roots blower or a {{turbocharger}}. The turbocharger (a combination turbo-compressor system) follows EMD's innovative design that uses a gear train and over-running clutch to drive the compressor rotor during low engine speed, when exhaust gas temperature (and, correspondingly, heat energy) alone is insufficient to drive the turbine. At higher engine speeds, increased exhaust gas temperature is sufficient to drive the turbine and the clutch disengages, turning the turbo-compressor system into a true turbocharger. The turbo-compressor can revert to compressor mode momentarily during demands for large increases in <b>engine</b> <b>output</b> power. While more expensive to maintain than Roots blowers, the turbocharger significantly reduces fuel consumption and emissions, while improving high-altitude performance. Additionally, EMD's turbo-compressor can provide a 50 percent increase in maximum rated horsepower over Roots-blown engines for the same engine displacement.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the biggest}} change to the {{previous}} Finnish ice class rules {{was the way the}} structural requirements were determined. Instead of percentages and experience the minimum requirements were based on plastic deformation theory and pressure loads determined from observations of past ice damages in the Baltic Sea. The ships were divided into three areas (bow, midship, aft) and the pressure loads were calculated for each area {{as a function of the}} ship's displacement and <b>engine</b> <b>output.</b> The rules regarding rudders, engines and the propulsion system were also changed accordingly, and the propulsion system was to be designed so that its strength increased towards the engine. This minimized the repair costs as the parts most likely to break, the propeller blades, were also the easiest and cheapest to replace. Furthermore, a minimum power requirement was given so that the ice-strengthened ships would be powerful enough to follow the icebreakers and not slow down the traffic.|$|E
25|$|In 1970 a {{workgroup}} {{consisting of}} the Finnish Maritime Administration, Wärtsilä Helsinki Shipyard and the association of the Finnish shipowners began working on the new ice class rules in close co-operation with major classification societies. Shortly after the work started the Swedish Maritime Administration joined and the new regulations, published in 1971, {{became known as the}} Finnish-Swedish ice class rules. According to the new rules the requirements for a ship with ice class 1A, deadweight tonnage of 3,500 tons and <b>engine</b> <b>output</b> of 1,500hp were kept largely the same, but the requirements for ships of the lowest ice class, 1C, were increased considerably as in the past such ships had been essentially open-water vessels with a strengthened bow. The minimum requirements for the highest ice class, 1A Super, were lowered to make the ships more attractive to shipowners and the requirements for ships with deadweight tonnage below 3,500 tons were increased in all classes to steer shipowners towards bigger vessels that were deemed better for navigation in ice.|$|E
5000|$|The 25E has {{the same}} {{features}} as the 20E but replaces the 20E's 2.0-liter engine with a 2.5-liter unit. The 25E's 2.5-liter 6G73 V6 <b>engine</b> <b>outputs</b> [...] at 6000 rpm and 222 Nm at 4500 rpm. The 25E has a frame number of E-F13A.|$|R
5000|$|The Nissan GT-R LM Nismo {{race car}} holds {{the record for}} being the most-powerful {{front-wheel-drive}} car, with its combustion <b>engine</b> <b>outputs</b> approximately [...] while the flywheel system is intended to have an additional output of approximately [...] This accounts {{for a total of}} [...]|$|R
50|$|The NV {{uses the}} same F-Alpha {{platform}} as does the Nissan Titan full-size pickup, but due {{to the need for}} a flat loading floor it is highly modified and they end up sharing mainly powertrain pieces and some appearance aspects. The NV is also only available with rear-wheel drive, coupled to a five-speed automatic transmission. The NV is not targeted directly at the (mainly fleet) buyers of the Ford E-Series and Chevrolet Express, but rather at private users who have hitherto often been buying more comfortable pickup trucks. The 4.0-litre V6 <b>engine</b> <b>outputs</b> 261 hp and 281 lb-ft of torque, while the 5.6-litre V8 <b>engine</b> <b>outputs</b> 317 hp and 385 lb-ft of torque. The V8-engined versions are also electronically limited to a top speed of 100 mph.|$|R
500|$|In the mid 1960s, it {{was decided}} to de-rate the <b>engine</b> <b>output</b> of the fleet from [...] to , {{significantly}} improving reliability by reducing stresses on the power plant, whilst not causing a noticeable reduction in performance.|$|E
500|$|Designed {{through early}} 1996, in September 1997 a revised LS 400 was {{introduced}} for the 1998 model year. Changes were a five-speed automatic transmission, increased <b>engine</b> <b>output</b> to , with {{variable valve timing}} (VVT-i), and an added [...] of torque. Acceleration times and fuel economy were improved as a result. The suspension and steering also received minor tweaks to improve feel and handling. Stylistically, the vehicle sported a new front fascia, side mirrors, and updated wheels; a rear window diversity antenna replaced the conventional power mast. The cabin received upgrades, including a trip computer, HomeLink, retractable rear headrests, reading lamps, and ultraviolet-tinted glass, while the climate control gained a micron filtration feature with a smog sensor.|$|E
500|$|The pound-force has a metric counterpart, less {{commonly}} used than the newton: the kilogram-force (kgf) (sometimes kilopond), is the force exerted by standard gravity on one kilogram of mass. The kilogram-force {{leads to an}} alternate, but rarely used unit of mass: the metric slug (sometimes mug or hyl) is that mass that accelerates at [...] when subjected to a force of 1kgf. The kilogram-force is {{not a part of}} the modern SI system, and is generally deprecated; however it still sees use for some purposes as expressing aircraft weight, jet thrust, bicycle spoke tension, torque wrench settings and <b>engine</b> <b>output</b> torque. Other arcane units of force include the sthène, which is equivalent to 1000N, and the kip, which is equivalent to 1000lbf.|$|E
50|$|The <b>engine’s</b> <b>output</b> is {{transmitted}} via a wide-ratio five-speed gearbox and compact new transfer case, with power delivery {{controlled by a}} hydraulic clutch featuring a four-step adjustable lever. For quiet operation together with low maintenance requirements, the Midnight Star {{is equipped with a}} belt drive system.|$|R
5000|$|The Veloster Turbo is a kammback {{turbocharged}} coupé. The model uses a 1.6L T-GDi Gamma {{engine that}} has different outputs {{depending on the}} market. In North America, the <b>engine</b> <b>outputs</b> [...] at 6,000 rpm, and [...] between 1,750-4,500 rpm. In other markets, such as Europe, it receives a lower-power <b>engine</b> <b>outputting</b> [...] at 5,500rpm with the same 265 Nm of torque, but altered to come earlier in the rev range at 1500 rpm. A possible reason for the European market receiving the lower-powered engine may be because the Kia Pro_Cee'd GT already makes use of the 150 kW engine. The car has three doors in North America and in Europe, making the Veloster Turbo's shooting brake body style both in North America and in Europe a relative novelty.|$|R
50|$|The Roadster was {{replaced}} for 1935 by the Road Star. It used a 14 hp (10.4 kW) 722 cc engine, and a Coupe model was also available. The <b>engine's</b> <b>output</b> was pushed to 16 hp (12 kW) for 1937. Production ended with Japan's entry into World War II in 1941.|$|R
