There are two main <b>energy</b> <b>models</b> preferred in Wireless Sensor Network, MICA MOTES and MICAZ. So here, we have investigated the more <b>energy</b> efficient <b>energy</b> <b>model</b> under different modulation schemes. So we can simply find the better <b>energy</b> <b>model</b> as well as the better modulation scheme to efficiently utilize the energy in WSN.

30|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the accuracy of}} our <b>energy</b> <b>model,</b> we compare it with the <b>energy</b> <b>models</b> of EEHCA [5], CRS [8], and the results from a Monte Carlo simulation [19]. Since the signaling overhead for clustering is not considered in the existing <b>energy</b> <b>models,</b> to compare {{the accuracy of the}} <b>energy</b> <b>models</b> under the same conditions, we {{evaluate the}} <b>energy</b> <b>models</b> ignoring the <b>energy</b> spent for signaling. Other multi-hop clustering algorithms such as OCND [9] and ECTC [10] adopt the same modeling approach as in EEHCA. Thus, their accuracies are almost identical to that of EEHCA. Hence, we compare our model with the model of EEHCA on their behalf.|$|R
40|$|The {{extended}} holographic dark <b>energy</b> <b>model</b> {{with the}} Hubble horizon as the infrared cutoff avoids {{the problem of}} the circular reasoning of the holographic dark <b>energy</b> <b>model.</b> Unfortunately, it is hit with the no-go theorem. In this paper, we consider the extended holographic dark <b>energy</b> <b>model</b> with a potential, V(ϕ), for the Brans-Dicke scalar field. With the addition of a potential for the Brans-Dicke scalar field, the extended holographic dark <b>energy</b> <b>model</b> using the Hubble horizon as the infrared cutoff is a viable dark <b>energy</b> <b>model,</b> and the model has the dark energy dominated attractor solution.

40|$|A new dark <b>energy</b> <b>model,</b> named "agegraphic dark energy", {{has been}} {{proposed}} recently, based on the so-called Károlyházy uncertainty relation, which arises from quantum mechanics together with general relativity. In this note, we extend the original agegraphic dark <b>energy</b> <b>model</b> by including the interaction between agegraphic dark energy and pressureless (dark) matter. In the interacting agegraphic dark <b>energy</b> <b>model,</b> there are many interesting features different from the original agegraphic dark <b>energy</b> <b>model</b> and holographic dark <b>energy</b> <b>model.</b> The similarity and difference between agegraphic dark energy and holographic dark energy are also discussed.

40|$|Protein {{structure}} prediction (PSP) is computationally a {{very challenging}} problem. The challenge largely {{comes from the}} fact that the energy function that needs to be minimised in order to obtain the native structure of a given protein is not clearly known. A high resolution 20 × 20 <b>energy</b> <b>model</b> could better capture the behaviour of the actual energy function than a low resolution <b>energy</b> <b>model</b> such as hydrophobic polar. However, the fine grained details of the high resolution interaction energy matrix are often not very informative for guiding the search. In contrast, a low resolution <b>energy</b> <b>model</b> could effectively bias the search towards certain promising directions. In this paper, we develop a genetic algorithm that mainly uses a high resolution <b>energy</b> <b>model</b> for protein structure evaluation but uses a low resolution HP <b>energy</b> <b>model</b> in focussing the search towards exploring structures that have hydrophobic cores. We experimentally show that this mixing of <b>energy</b> <b>models</b> leads to significant lower energy structures compared to the state-of-the-art results...|$|R

As an addition to former models, the bit toggling on internal and external busses as well as accesses to off-chip memories are considered. To determine the characteristics, a measuring method is presented which can be used to establish the <b>energy</b> <b>model</b> without detailed knowledge of the internal processor structures.

With increasing agricultural and industrial activities in the country, the demand for energy is also increasing. Formulation of an <b>energy</b> <b>model</b> will help in the proper allocation of widely available renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, bioenergy and small hydropower in meeting the future energy demand in India.
