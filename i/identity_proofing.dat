50|$|Identification and Authentication (I&A) is {{the process}} of verifying that an {{identity}} is bound to the entity that makes an assertion or claim of identity. The I&A process assumes that there was an initial validation of the identity, commonly called <b>identity</b> <b>proofing.</b> Various methods of <b>identity</b> <b>proofing</b> are available, ranging from in-person validation using government issued identification, to anonymous methods that allow the claimant to remain anonymous, but known to the system if they return. The method used for <b>identity</b> <b>proofing</b> and validation should provide an assurance level commensurate with the intended use of the identity within the system. Subsequently, the entity asserts an identity together with an authenticator as a means for validation. The only requirements for the identifier is that it must be unique within its security domain.|$|E

This problem can be solved by combining a secret sharing scheme with authentication and digital signature protocols. This paper describes the difficulties to combine a secret sharing scheme with the authentication and digital signature protocols and proposes a draft solution. 1. Introduction Computer network security addresses several problems, namely data secrecy, integrity, authentication and digital signature problems. Data secrecy and integrity are the problems of secret and reliable data communication between two communicating entities.

5000|$|Different IdPs follow {{different}} {{policies and}} procedures for issuing electronic identity credentials. In the business world, and especially in government, the more trustworthy the credential, the more stringent the rules governing <b>identity</b> <b>proofing,</b> credential management {{and the kind of}} credentials issued. But while different IdPs follow their own rules, more and more end users (often called subscribers) and online services (often called relying parties) wish to trust existing credentials and not issue yet another set of userID/passwords or other credentials for use to access one service. This is where the concept of Federated Identity becomes important. Federated Identity provides IdPs and relying parties with a common set of identity trust conventions that transcend individual identity service providers, users, or networks, so that a relying party will know it can trust a credential issued by IdP 'A' at a level of assurance comparable to a common standard, which will also be agreed upon by IdPs 'B,' 'C,' and 'D.' ...|$|E

40|$|In type theory a {{proposition}} {{is represented by}} a type, the type of its proofs. As a consequence the equality relation on a certain type is represented by a binary family of types. Equality on a type may be conventional or inductive. Conventional equality means that one particular equivalence relation is singled out as the equality, while inductive equality, which we also call identity, is inductively defined as the "smallest reflexive relation". It is sometimes convenient {{to know that the}} type representing {{a proposition}} is collapsed in the sense that all its inhabitants are identical. Although uniqueness of <b>identity</b> <b>proofs</b> for an arbitrary type is not derivable inside type theory, there is a large class of types for which it may be proved.

Since the process began, the NRC has approved access to over 900 individuals representing over 600 licensees.

Although the process is lengthy and technically challenging, the NRC strongly encourages licensees to use the online system as it is the most effective, efficient, and most accurate method to report their source transactions. While the regulations allows for various methods to report source transactions, many licensees have opted to report their transactions via fax, which has proved to create a number of issues. These known issues have been relayed to licensees through the NSTS Blog. Discussion: Many licensees have transitioned from reporting their transactions via fax to using the NSTS online system; however, there are still a large number of licensees who continue t...|$|E
