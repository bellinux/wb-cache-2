25|$|As noted at the beginning, {{the effects}} of the atomic {{structure}} of materials are disregarded in the relatively simple treatments of field electron emission discussed here. Taking atomic structure properly into account is a very difficult problem, and only limited progress has been made.

25|$|Cold field {{electron}} emission (CFE) {{is the name}} given to a particular statistical emission regime, in which the electrons in the emitter are initially in internal thermodynamic equilibrium, and in which most emitted electrons escape by <b>Fowler-Nordheim</b> <b>tunneling</b> from electron states close to the emitter Fermi level. (By contrast, in the Schottky emission regime, most electrons escape {{over the top of}} a field-reduced barrier, from states well above the Fermi level.) Many solid and liquid materials can emit electrons in a CFE regime if an electric field of an appropriate size is applied.|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{the theory}} of the actual <b>Fowler-Nordheim</b> <b>tunneling</b> process is much the same for all {{materials}} (though details of barrier shape may vary, and modified theory has to be developed for initial states that are localized rather than are travelling-wave-like). However, notwithstanding such differences, one expects (for thermodynamic equilibrium situations) that all CFE equations will have exponents that behave in a generally similar manner. This is why applying Fowler-Nordheim-type equations to materials outside the scope of the derivations given here often works. If interest is only in parameters (such as field enhancement factor) that relate to the slope of Fowler-Nordheim or Millikan-Lauritsen plots and to the exponent of the CFE equation, then Fowler-Nordheim-type theory will often give sensible estimates. However, attempts to derive meaningful current density values will usually or always fail.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — We {{present an}} {{efficient}} and accurate method {{to characterize the}} physical thickness of ultrathin gate oxides (down to 25 ˚A) and the effective polysilicon doping of advanced CMOS devices.

By fitting the model to measured data, both the gate oxide thickness and the effective poly doping are unambiguously determined. Unlike the traditional capacitance–voltage (g 0 †) technique that overestimates thin-oxide thickness and requires large area capacitor, this approach results in true physical thickness and the measurement can be performed on a standard sub-half micron transistor.

Results are in good agreement with experimental data on TANOS devices with different gate-stack compositions, considering a quite extended range of gate biases and times. The reduced gate-bias sensitivity of the programming transients with respect to the floating-gate cell is explained in terms of a finite number of nitride traps and a thinner extension of the nitride trapping region as the gate bias is increased.
