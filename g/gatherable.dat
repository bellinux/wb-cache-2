Quigglies generally come in large groupings known as quiggly towns, some with hundreds of holes indicating a potential population of thousands. Some of these holes were residential for single family or larger groups, while some may have been storage only. Quiggly towns are typically located where solar exposure, water supply, and access to fish, game and <b>gatherable</b> foodstuffs are favorable.|$|E
50|$|There exists {{evidence}} that the human memory system has evolved to be equipped with a gathering-related navigation system, helping remember the location of <b>gatherable</b> food sources in spatial memory. This was suggested {{in a recent study}} that tested spatial memory for various food items, with additional predictions later extended and validated. In the first study, both males and females were shown to have better spatial memory for more caloric foods at a farmer's market than foods with a lower calorie content. It has been suggested that calorie-dense foods are an important resource to be able to gather in an ancestral environment, and the inability to locate this kind of food would put an organism at a disadvantage.|$|E
40|$|A team {{consisting}} {{of an unknown}} number of mobile agents, starting from different nodes of an unknown network, possibly at different times, have to meet at the same node. Agents are anonymous (identical), execute the same deterministic algorithm and move in synchronous rounds along links of the network. Which configurations are <b>gatherable</b> and how to gather all of them deterministically by the same algorithm? We give a complete solution of this gathering problem in arbitrary networks. We characterize all <b>gatherable</b> configurations and give two universal deterministic gathering algorithms, i. e., algorithms that gather all <b>gatherable</b> configurations. The first algorithm works under the assumption that an upper bound n {{on the size of the}} network is known. In this case our algorithm guarantees gathering with detection, i. e., the existence of a round for any <b>gatherable</b> configuration, such that all agents are at the same node and all declare that gathering is accomplished. If no upper bound on the size of the network is known, we show that a universal algorithm for gathering with detection does not exist. Hence, for this harder scenario, we construct a second universal gathering algorithm, which guarantees that, for any <b>gatherable</b> configuration, all agents eventually get to one node and stop, although they cannot tell if gathering is over. The time of the first algorithm is polynomial in the upper bound n on the size of the network, and the time of the second algorithm is polynomial in the (unknown) size itself. Our results have an important consequence for the leader election problem for anonymous agents in arbitrary graphs. For anonymous agents in graphs, leader election turns out to be equivalent to gathering with detection. Hence, as a by-product, we obtain a complete solution of the leader election problem for anonymous agents in arbitrary graphs...|$|E
40|$|Current {{research}} increasingly {{suggests that}} spatial cognition in humans {{is accomplished by}} many specialized mechanisms, each designed to solve a particular adaptive problem. A major adaptive problem for our hominin ancestors, particularly females, was the need to efficiently gather immobile foods which could vary greatly in quality, quantity, spatial location and temporal availability. We propose a cognitive model of a navigational gathering adaptation in humans and test its predictions in samples from the US and Japan. Our results are uniformly supportive: the human mind appears equipped with a navigational gathering adaptation that encodes the location of <b>gatherable</b> foods into spatial memory. This mechanism appears to be chronically active in women and activated under explicit motivation in men...|$|E
40|$|Beauty and its refusal are {{not merely}} a cipher of contemporaneity but a topic {{discussed}} since antiquity. The rivalry between lyre and flute, between harmony, mathematically determinable, and melody, <b>gatherable</b> only by hearing, arises from the myth, from the fight between Apollo and Marsia, where Greece and Phrygia, Europe and Asia are opposed in a civilisations collision. In modernity this collision arose again as political, whereas the egalitarian melody is opposed to the elitist harmony. Into this collision we find fine arts, not beauty anymore: fine arts leave the territory of beaux arts of fine poetry but remain, for contemporaneity, works of art. But what do arts, not beauty anymore, or even ugly, want? Which aim do they pursue? How can we judge them...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} gathering identical, memoryless, mobile robots in one node of an anonymous unoriented ring. Robots start from different nodes of the ring. They operate in Look-Compute-Move cycles and have {{to end up in}} the same node. In one cycle, a robot takes a snapshot of the current configuration (Look), makes a decision to stay idle or to move to one of its adjacent nodes (Compute), and in the latter case makes an instantaneous move to this neighbor (Move). Cycles are performed asynchronously for each robot. For an odd number of robots we prove that gathering is feasible if and only if the initial configuration is not periodic, and we provide a gathering algorithm for any such configuration. For an even number of robots we decide feasibility of gathering except for one type of symmetric initial configurations, and provide gathering algorithms for initial configurations proved to be <b>gatherable...</b>|$|E
40|$|We present {{evidence}} for an evolved sexually dimorphic adaptation that activates spatial memory and navigation skills {{in response to}} fruits, vegetables and other traditionally <b>gatherable</b> sessile food resources. In spite of extensive {{evidence for}} a male advantage {{on a wide variety}} of navigational tasks, we demonstrate that a simple but ecologically important shift in content can reverse this sex difference. This effect is predicted by and consistent with the theory that a sexual division in ancestral foraging labour selected for gathering-specific spatial mechanisms, some of which are sexually differentiated. The hypothesis that gathering-specific spatial adaptations exist in the human mind is further supported by our finding that spatial memory is preferentially engaged for resources with higher nutritional quality (e. g. caloric density). This result strongly suggests that the underlying mechanisms evolved in part as adaptations for efficient foraging. Together, these results demonstrate that human spatial cognition is content sensitive, domain specific and designed by natural selection to mesh with important regularities of the ancestral world...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{studies the}} {{gathering}} problem on grid networks. A team of robots placed at different nodes of a grid, {{have to meet}} at some node and remain there. Robots operate in Look-Compute-Move cycles; in one cycle, a robot perceives the current configuration in terms of occupied nodes (Look), decides whether to move towards one of its neighbors (Compute), and in the positive case makes the computed move instantaneously (Move). Cycles are performed asynchronously for each robot. The problem has been deeply studied for the case of ring networks. However, the known techniques used on rings cannot be directly extended to grids. Moreover, on rings, another assumption concerning the so-called multiplicity detection capability was {{required in order to}} accomplish the gathering task. That is, a robot is able to detect during its Look operation whether a node is empty, or occupied by one robot, or occupied by an undefined number of robots greater than one. In this paper, we provide a full characterization about <b>gatherable</b> configurations for grids. In particular, we show that in this case, the multiplicity detection is not required. Very interestingly, sometimes the problem appears trivial, as it is for the case of grids with both odd sides, while sometimes the involved techniques require new insights with respect to the well-studied ring case. Moreover, our results reveal the importance of a structure like the grid that allows to overcome the multiplicity detection with respect to the ring case. ...|$|E
40|$|Consider {{a system}} of {{autonomous}} mobile robots initially randomly deployed on the nodes of an anonymous finite grid. A gathering algorithm is a sequence of moves to be executed independently by each robot so that all robots meet at a single node after finite time. The robots operate in Look-Compute-Move cycles. In each cycle, a robot takes {{a snapshot of the}} current configuration of the grid in terms of occupied nodes (Look), then based on the perceived configuration, decides whether to stay put or to move to an adjacent node (Compute), and in the later case makes an instantaneous move accordingly (Move). The robots have weak multiplicity detection capability, which enables them to detect if a node is empty or occupied by a single robot or by multiple robots. The robots are asynchronous, oblivious, anonymous, can not communicate with each other and execute the same distributed algorithm. In a faulty system, however, any robot can crash, which means that it becomes completely inactive and does not take part in the process any further. In that case a fault-tolerant gathering algorithm is an algorithm that gathers all the non-faulty robots at a single node. This paper considers a faulty system that can have at most one crash fault. With these assumptions deterministic fault-tolerant gathering algorithms are presented that gather all initial configurations that are <b>gatherable</b> in a non-faulty system, except for one specific configuration called the 2 S 2 configuration...|$|E

40|$|Problem {{risen from}} temporariness and {{flexibility}} concepts of built concern, always constituted, all over technological advanced countries {{and throughout the}} whole history of scientific research, some of the most interesting aspects of technologies, industry and industrialization processes. Several project proposals about really light structures easily <b>gatherable,</b> transportable, that can be dismantled and reconverted, are proves of that such as their use in order to obtain flexible and functional living solutions. They are systems adaptable to different needs and fit to offer a concrete solution for the necessities related to the new ways of living. In fact temporary buildings that were thought during the past to face living emergencies, caused by natural calamities or men themselves, find today a wide range of applications such as living places for nomads, refugees, exiles, migrants, homelesses. These buildings can moreover be used as courtesy-houses during renovation, restoration, changeover and recovery interventions both of single handiworks and of urban scale or can be used as accommodation structures for wandering tourism, support systems to mass manifestations and so on. Today research is even more oriented to the discovery of innovative building technologies that concern the adoption of usages, materials and building elements with high performance characteristics that respond to eco-compatibilities priority needs. Under this point of view, temporary architectures can be transformed into structures able to guarantee the top level of comfort and eco-sustainability because they offer wide opportunities to the experimentation of new building materials and allow a more direct check of building processes such as a more immediate management of comfort control. The theme of temporary architectures has been, during this years, the object of the didactic experience inside the course of Environmental Design belonging to the Architecture Faculty in Palermo. The problem of environmental compatibility of the anthropic intervention has been afforded by students through a design approach of bioclimatic kind, preferring solutions economically fit both under the realization costs point of view, and management such as maintenance and re-employment, using materials and techniques fit in order to: -	guarantee the living quality of the built area; -	rationalize the consumes of natural resources especially the not renewable ones; -	allow the adaptability of the handiwork to the changeable needs (in continue evolution) that characterize the contemporary society. This contribute wants to present a synthesis of the design proposals elaborated till today, in order to witness the experiences carried on such theme...|$|E
40|$|In {{the view}} of Islamic philosophers, famous {{definition}} for causality is "giving existence". The Molla Sadra believes that the Principle of causality with its branches constitutes a single body, and its acceptance is considered as postulate. Discussion about the criteria of neediness of effect to cause is considered branch of the general law of causality which is necessary in discussion of causal necessity. It is obvious that Molla Sadra 's view in determining the criteria for the neediness is the Possibility {{in the sense of}} need. as regards, this principle is itself a branch of the general principle of causality, and the Islamic philosophers think if someone refuses to accept a branch of causality, cannot believe in a causal system in the world. and as regards, the principle of cognation Is assumed to be identical with the intellectual rule of Al-vaheed(from The one will not be issued except the one) and the principle of The impossibility of infinite regress are other important branches of the principle of causality; acceptance of this branches Required in duality in the outside world from mind and dividing existence to the cause and effect and grades in the reality of existence. But on the other hand, Molla Sadra talks about personal unity of existence and also considers it as the conclusion of his intellectual analysis, not as something merely mystical and has explicit expressions such as:«لیس لما سوی الواحد الحق وجود لا استقلالی ولا تعلقی بل وجوداتها لیس الا تطورات الحق باطواره و شئوناته بشئونه الذاتیه» In views of Professor Motahari and Professor Javadi Amoli which both are raised in Sadraism system, and the originality of existence and Possibility in the sense of need are assumed in it; these are the result of dual discussions of Molla Sadra. In the first standpoint(Professor Motahari) is proposed a kind of existence That is completely dependent; But In the latter standpoint(Professor Javadi Amoli) pure neediness is proposed, and interpretation to existence is a kind of metaphor. In the first interpretation, the place of science and philosophy has reserved, and the mystic quote introduced as anti-science and philosophy. But the second interpretation, speaking in completion of philosophy, Does not contradict with pure mysticism and unity; namely in the first interpretation is proposed the systemic nature of the world and causal relationships and their different existential levels; But In the second interpretation, there is no relationship between causes and effects, and all effects, immediately connect to an independent unity. So, as these interpretations indicate, from Molla Sadra,s philosophical basis, personal unity of existence and also its unity of grades of existence are Extractive. However, according to some intellectual analysis, and considering some explicit statements of Molla Sadra in the discussions of emanation which criticize The first intelect to be the first emanation and introduces it according to the view's of philosophers (Molla Sadra, 1990, vol 2, p 332), And says about the expanded emanation and does not know the relationship between expanded emanation and God as the causal relationship in the meaning of giving existence. He also considers the result of causality discussion that is leaded to emanation and personal unity, as the completion of causality. It can be concluded that Molla Sadra presents the final result as personal unity and causality in the sense of emanation. This is the point that is also finally accepted by Professor Motahari to some extent that in terms of Motahari,s view, Molla Sadra 's theory of grades of exitence is according to the formal philosopher's disposition. But this conclusion is not incompatible with accepting the principle of the grades of existence in a single mind and these two principles are <b>gatherable.</b> This remark {{can be found in the}} some of Molla Sadra 's statements. As an example, Molla Sadra, in Msh'ar book, pp. 68 - 69, while knows the final result as emanation, introduces the theory of the grades of existence as a result of the glorious and accurate mind. When he was conveying a meaning to dependent and independent existence which are of the principles of these discussions, uses two explications, once says: «علی ان الحق ان الاتفاق بینهما فی مجرد اللفظ» And once again says:« والاتفاق النوعی فی طبیعه الوجود مطلقا عندنا لا ینافی التخالف النوعی فی معانیها الذاتیه ومفهوماتها الانتزاعیه». It can be said that the cause of difference between Molla Sadra 's expressions which has led to many interpretations, lies in the kind of mind's view to the existence. Sometimes the mind transcend so much that knows every object, including self, immediately very related to an independent unity and if it declined, it would have associated beings with it intermediately and systematically. So domains and perspectives are differen...|$|E
