5|$|A mayor-council {{government}} {{has been in place}} in Tulsa since 1989 when the city converted from a city commission government deemed wasteful and less efficient. Since the change, Tulsa mayors have been <b>given</b> <b>more</b> power in accordance with a strong mayoral system and have greater control of a more consolidated array of governmental branches. Plurality voting is used to elect mayors, who serve a term in office of four years. The present mayor of Tulsa is Republican G. T.

5|$|According to Ming Pao, {{family members}} of the victims were {{dissatisfied}} with the official investigation and held a sit-in protest, calling for a fair judgement.

Others blamed an ineffective firefighting system for the high death toll, and were dissatisfied that they were not <b>given</b> <b>more</b> details about the fire.|$|E
5|$|According {{to their}} Confucian ethics, elite and cultured scholar-officials viewed {{themselves}} as the pinnacle members of society (second only to the imperial family).

5|$|An Inconvenient Truth is a 2006 American {{documentary}} film directed by Davis Guggenheim about former United States Vice President Al Gore's campaign to educate citizens {{about global warming}} via a comprehensive slide show that, by his own estimate made in the film, he has <b>given</b> <b>more</b> than a thousand times.

5|$|In {{adults and}} {{children}} {{over the age of}} 12, linezolid is usually given every 12 hours, whether orally or intravenously. In younger children and infants, it is given every eight hours. No dosage adjustments are required in the elderly, in people with mild-to-moderate liver failure, or in those with impaired kidney function. In people requiring hemodialysis, care should be taken to give linezolid after a session, because dialysis removes 30â€“40% of a dose from the body; no dosage adjustments are needed in people undergoing continuous hemofiltration, although more frequent administration may be warranted in some cases. According to one study, linezolid may need to be <b>given</b> <b>more</b> frequently than normal in people with burns affecting more than 20% of body area, due to increased nonrenal clearance of the drug.|$|E
5|$|In {{exploring}} {{the similarities between}} Sjair Abdoel Moeloek and Siti Akbari, Zaini-Lajoubert notes that {{the names of the}} individual kingdoms, save Barham (Barbam in Siti Akbari), are taken directly from the earlier work. Names of characters, such as Abdul Muluk (in Siti Akbari, Abdul Moelan) and Siti Rapiah (Siti Akbari), are simply replaced, although some minor characters are present in one story and not the other. The main plot elements in both stories are the same; some elements, such as the birth and childhood of Abdul Muluk and the later adventures of Siti Rapiah's son, are present in one story and not the otherâ€“ or <b>given</b> <b>more</b> detail.

5|$|Koster sees {{effects of}} realism, {{especially}} the idealistic realism {{held at the}} time in the Netherlands, in the work. He notes that motives and causality are <b>given</b> <b>more</b> weight in the narrative than in most contemporary works. He observes that this is also reflected in the characters, whoâ€“ although royalty and holy menâ€“ were given the traits of persons one could find in real-life Batavia (now Jakarta). The use of punctuation, another trait uncommon in the local literature of the time, may also have served to give a more realistic reading and reflected the work's origin as a written manuscript and not from oral literature. Tio Ie Soei described the work's rhythm as more akin to speech than song.|$|E
5|$|Released nearly 8 {{months after}} the first two Zelda CD-i games, Zelda's Adventure was created by a {{different}} third-party developer, Viridis. The game again follows a nontraditional Zelda-saves-Link plotline, but it uses a different game engine than Faces of Evil and Wand of Gamelon. Whereas the first two CD-i games were patterned on the side-scrolling Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, Zelda's Adventure took the top-down The Legend of Zelda as its model. Zelda's Adventure featured FMV cutscenes, but rather than using drawn animation, the game used live-action scenes. Reception for the game was poor, and whereas some modern critics have <b>given</b> <b>more</b> nuanced reviews {{of the first two}} games, modern criticism for Zelda's Adventure is unanimously negative.|$|E
