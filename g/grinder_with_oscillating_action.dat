The towpregs are collimated {{so that each}} towpreg is parallel. A material is applied to {{each side of the}} towpreg to form a sandwich. The sandwich is heated to a temperature wherein the polymer flows and intimately contacts the filaments and pressure is repeatedly applied perpendicularly to the sandwich <b>with</b> a longitudinal <b>oscillating</b> <b>action</b> wherein the filaments move apart and the polymer wets the filaments forming a uni-tape prepreg. The uni-tape prepreg is subsequently cooled...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA general {{approach}} to study <b>oscillating</b> <b>action</b> on nonlinear dynamical systems is developed. It implies {{a transition from}} initial governing equations of motion to much more simple equations describing only the main slow component of motions (the vibro-transformed dynamics equations). The approach is named as the Oscillatory Strobodynamics, since motions are perceived as under a stroboscopic light. The vibro-transformed dynamics equations comprise terms that represent the averaged effect of the <b>oscillating</b> <b>action.</b> The method of direct separation of motions (MDSM) {{appears to be an}} efficient and simple tool to derive these equations. A modification of the method applicable to study problems that do not imply restrictions on the spectrum of excitation frequencies is proposed. It allows also to abandon other restrictions usually introduced when employing the classical asymptotic methods, e. g. the requirement for the involved nonlinearities to be weak. Several relevant examples from Mechanics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biophysics are considered by means of the conventional MDSM and, in more details, by the modified MDSM, illustrating the efficiency the methods...|$|R
