25|$|Four {{accounts}} of Berti's experiment exist, but a simple model of his experiment consisted of filling with water a long tube that had both ends plugged, then standing the tube in a basin already full of water. The bottom {{end of the}} tube was opened, and water that had been inside of it poured out into the basin. However, {{only part of the}} water in the tube flowed out, and the level of the water inside the tube stayed at an exact level, which happened to be 10.3m, the same height Baliani and Galileo had observed that was limited by the siphon. What was most <b>important</b> <b>about</b> this experiment was that the lowering water had left a space above it in the tube which had no intermediate contact with air to fill it up. This seemed to suggest the possibility of a vacuum existing in the space above the water.|$|E

Bilheimer wrote that [...] "the storytelling in the Cambodia segment of Not My Life remains intact and is still very moving, with an even sharper focus, now, on the girls themselves." [...] In this statement, Bilheimer requested that people screening previous versions of the film tell their audiences that the presence of Somaly in the film is understandably a distraction, that the film is not primarily about Somaly but rather about the millions of children in slavery in the world, and that this focus is what is most <b>important</b> <b>about</b> the film.|$|E
500|$|After Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite was completed, the {{finished}} recordings {{were presented to}} Columbia Records in mid 1995. It was shelved for nearly a year, because of issues with Columbia's management, the label's extensive reorganization, and record executives' doubts regarding the album's commercial potential. The marketplace dominance of hip hop soul in 1995 was in contrast with Maxwell's monogamous themes and older soul influences, which Columbia worried would be interpreted as old-fashioned. The label's executives also feared that his romantic concept and image would not appeal to listeners. Maxwell made matters worse by refusing to allow his picture {{to be placed on}} the album's front cover; instead he preferred to have the track listing and other information he felt was more <b>important</b> <b>about</b> the album in place of his photo. Regarding the cover, Maxwell later said [...] "I wanted people to have the facts: the title, the selections {{and the fact that you}} had to basically buy it. I wanted people to come to the music and not base any opinion on the image". Columbia reached a compromise with Maxwell and used a promotional shot of him as the back cover. The album's front cover art also features a picture of a pair of golden women's shoes on the floor of a hotel room, with the bar coding prominently displayed. In the period before its release, Maxwell wrote and demoed songs for a subsequent studio album, and embarked on an African American college tour with Groove Theory and the Fugees.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{fruitful}} and contentious has been the consideration of Austen as a political writer. As critic Gary Kelly explains, [...] "Some see her as a political 'conservative' because she seems to defend the established social order. Others see her as sympathetic to 'radical' politics that challenged the established order, especially {{in the form of}} [...] critics see Austen's novels as neither conservative nor subversive, but complex, criticizing aspects of the social order but supporting stability and an open class hierarchy." [...] In Jane Austen and the War of Ideas (1975), perhaps {{the most important of these}} works, Marilyn Butler argues that Austen was steeped in, not insulated from, the principal moral and political controversies of her time, and espoused a partisan, fundamentally conservative and Christian position in these controversies. In a similar vein, Alistair M. Duckworth in The Improvement of the Estate: A Study of Jane Austen's Novels (1971) argues that Austen used the concept of the [...] "estate" [...] to symbolise all that was <b>important</b> <b>about</b> contemporary English society, which should be conserved, improved, and passed down to future generations. Duckworth argued that Austen followed Edmund Burke, who in his 1790 book Reflections on the Revolution in France had used the metaphor of an estate that represented the work of generations, and which could be only be improved, never altered, for the way that society ought to work. Duckworth noted that in Austen's books, one's ability to keep an estate going, which could only be improved, but never altered if one was to be true to the estate, is usually the measure of one's good character. Butler placed Austen in the context of the reaction against the French Revolution, where excessive emotionalism and the sentimental [...] "cult of sensibility" [...] came to be identified with sexual promiscuity, atheism, and political radicalism. Butler argued that a novel like Sense and Sensibility, where Marianne Dashwood is unable to control her emotions, is part of the conservative anti-revolutionary literature that sought to glorify old fashioned values and politics. Irvine pointed out that the identification of the [...] "cult of sensibility" [...] with republicanism was one that existed only in the minds of conservatives, and in fact the French Republic also rejected sentimentalism, so Butler's challenge is to prove Austen's call for emotional self-restraint as expressed by a character like Elinor Dashwood is in fact grounded in conservative politics. Butler wrote [...] "the characteristic recourse of the conservative...is to remind us ultimately of the insignificance of individual rights and even individual concerns when measured against the scale of 'the universe as one vast whole'". Irvine wrote that novels like Sense and Sensibility appeared to support Butler's thesis, but a novel like Pride and Prejudice does not, as Elizabeth Bennet is an individualist and a non-conformist who ridicules everything who to a certain extent has to learn the value of sentiment.|$|E

2500|$|The Objectivist {{theory of}} art flows from its epistemology, {{by way of}} [...] "psycho-epistemology" [...] (Rand's term for an individual's {{characteristic}} mode of functioning in acquiring knowledge). Art, according to Objectivism, serves a human cognitive need: it allows human beings to grasp concepts {{as though they were}} percepts. Objectivism defines [...] "art" [...] as a [...] "selective re-creation of reality according to an artist's metaphysical value-judgments"—that is, according to what the artist believes to be ultimately true and <b>important</b> <b>about</b> the nature of reality and humanity.

2500|$|On 13 April 2008 it was {{announced}} that, {{on the recommendation of}} the Labor Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, the Queen had approved Bryce's appointment as the next Governor-General of Australia. The decision was generally well received: current and previous Labor state premiers supported her selection and both the then Leader of the Opposition, Brendan Nelson, and the leader of the Australian Greens, Bob Brown, spoke in favour of the decision. Patricia Edgar described Bryce's selection as an [...] "inspired choice", while Jill Singer in the Herald Sun said that the decision signalled [...] "an <b>important</b> <b>about</b> face for Australia".|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the similarity in style between these and pictographic Shang and early Zhou clan symbols, what is <b>important</b> <b>about</b> the latter two types {{is that they have}} multiple components, reminiscent of the compounding of elements in the Chinese script, thus eliciting claims of a relationship. Yu Xingwu identified the circle-and-cloud graph as the Chinese character for [...] "dawn", 旦 dàn, while Táng Lán identified it as [...] "bright", 炅 jiǒng, and so on. Helping fuel speculation of a link between Dawenkou symbols and Shang writing is their somewhat greater proximity in time (1400 years distance) and space to the Shang oracle bones, compared to earlier Neolithic finds; furthermore, the Shandong Dawenkou culture is thought by some to be ancestral to Shandong Longshan culture, which in turn may have given rise to early Shang culture.|$|E

2500|$|Bennett {{suggests}} that if Christians and Muslims accept that their formulations {{about the nature of}} God are wholly true but do not express the whole truth about God, they might both say something <b>important</b> <b>about</b> God. [...] "Paradox", he says, such as that God is One but also a Trinity, [...] "could be … essential to the nature of God, who is at one and the same time transcendent and immanent, just and merciful, simple yet complex, singular yet possessing plural attributes, distinct from creation yet intimately involved in, and even present within, creation." [...] Thus, God might speak differently though different religions not [...] "because God is playing a game or authoring confusion but to remind us that we cannot, while remaining human, grasp the totality of who God is." [...] Bennett refers to what he calls his [...] "flirtation with Unitarianism" [...] although states that [...] "over the years" [...] his [...] "faith has become firmly Trinitarian." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sylvia, and Coppélia before it, {{are often}} touted {{as two of}} the first modern ballets for their novel scores. Tchaikovsky himself remarked to fellow {{composer}} Sergei Taneyev upon the ingenuity of Sylvia, calling it [...] "... the first ballet, where the music constitutes not only the main, but the only interest. What charm, what elegance, what richness of melody, rhythm, harmony." [...] While this statement {{may be a little}} hyperbolic, it says something very <b>important</b> <b>about</b> the uniqueness of the ballet. Sylvias score is varied and rich, and it stands out, drawing the focus from the sets, the dancers, the costumes. Instead of receding into the background, setting only the mood, Delibes' score sets the action. The music of Sylvia was also notable for its new, more developed use of leitmotifs. Such a stylistic choice is characteristic of Delibes, who was a great admirer of Wagner. Indeed, echoes of Wagner's influence are quite obvious in the music such as its [...] "symphonic" [...] nature, as described by Ivor Forbes Guest in the 1954 edition of The Ballet Annual.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{historians have}} very {{different}} ideas regarding the authorship of A General History and what this attribution means for historiography.

[...] Since the attribution, there have been three schools of thought concerning the subject: those who agree with Moore's conclusions, those who do not, and even some who do not think that it matters. [...] Prior to Furbank and Owens' work on Defoe's canon, some scholars accepted that Defoe authored A General History, while others postulated that authorship does not matter. [...] Interestingly, however, some people, still believed that Defoe was the author. Some scholars compared the work to other records and sources from the time and concluded that A General History is highly significant for its amount of accuracy, regardless of attribution. [...] What is most <b>important</b> <b>about</b> this work is not who penned it, but that it represents what people thought about pirates in the early eighteenth century.|$|E
