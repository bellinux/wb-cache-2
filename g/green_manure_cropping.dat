40|$|We {{examined}} the rationale of introduction and continuation of fallow <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> <b>cropping</b> in large-scale upland farming. First, {{the decision on}} the introduction of fallow <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> <b>cropping</b> depends {{on the scale of}} farming in terms of farming area and, if introduced, the acreage of such crops represents around 5 % of the total acreage. Second, although the introduction of fallow green manure, which is a non-cash crop, causes decline in direct profitability, overall costs are reduced. Therefore, few differences in income per unit area were found among the cases of continuous, non-continuous, and non-introduction of fallow <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> <b>cropping.</b> In other words, there are few grounds for concern over a decline in profitability, for the halting or non continuation of fallow <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> <b>cropping</b> because of the availability of crop subsidies. Third, imbalanced crop compositions are observed in the cases of non continuation fallow <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> <b>cropping,</b> indicating the difficulty in establishing a crop rotation.

40|$|In Hokkaido, the {{large-scale}} upland farming {{crop rotation system}} is in disorder, so its effect on land productivity is cause for concern. Therefore,the usefulness of fallow <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> <b>cropping</b> is pointed out. But, {{from the fact that}} it is a non commodity crop, positioning in regard to crop selection farmers is low. So, bidding which is directed to its fixation is necessary. In this paper, we will explore the elucidation of introduction fixation conditions of fallow <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> <b>cropping</b> in large-scale upland farming. The focus of this paper, Sarabetsu village in the Tokachi region, is a typical example of largescale upland farming. First, frequency and continuity of fallow <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> <b>cropping</b> of upland farming were rearranged. As a result, we can see that similar types such as "continuation" "discontinuance" "non continuation", clearly showing the differences in cropping conduct. Second, based on field investigations, the primary factors of introduction fixation of fallow <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> <b>cropping</b> are made clear; 1) The recognition of improvements for the crop rotation system, 2) The necessity of guaranteeing a yearly gross income, and, 3) Present scale and existence of scale enlargement conditions. Third, the crop selection of large-scale upland farming, making use of linear programming, was modeled and appraised. When obedience of the crop rotation system is designated as a purpose, fallow <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> <b>cropping</b> selection occurred according to the area. It was selected in the 5 - 10 % of the total area when it was present. Fourth, comparison of the profitability with fallow <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> <b>cropping</b> was conducted. Although it caused profit decreases, the cost decreased to a greater degree. Furthermore, per area income showed the fact that there is little overall difference. From the results above, 3 points were given as a fallow green manure introduction fixation conditions. First, introduction makes farm working adjustments possible, making the obedience of crop rotation possible. Under present conditions, recognition of the management for wheat repeated cultivation has influenced fallow <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> <b>cropping</b> introduction. Because of that, recognition improvement of the problems which occur with repeated cultivation is necessary. Second, it is important to consider,as clearly shown by analysis, that fallow <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> <b>cropping</b> does not always reduce profits, but that its overall impact is negligible. Third, it is large-scale farming with which fallow <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> <b>cropping</b> introduction has rationality, and the introduction ratio is 5 - 10 % of the cropping acreage. It is also necessary for such bidding to be done. When constructing the crop rotation system of large-scale upland farming, in the point where construction of a stable 4 year crop rotation system is made possible, the importance of fallow <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> <b>cropping</b> is great...|$|E

Due {{to the evolution}} of the environmental policy, practice of <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> <b>cropping</b> has been replaced by autumn cover crops in order to take up nitrate residues of the soil. These crops (mustard, phacelia, rye-grass, rye) show a high ability to take up N (sometimes more than 100 kg N. ha- 1), leading to a decreasing threat for nitrate leaching. Such an ability is however related to species, but also to cropping practices mainly sowing date. Subsequent mineralization (measured with labeling 15 N technic) of this organic-green manure-N, influenced by physical and chemical characteristics of the ploughed biomass, seems however limited (less than 45 % of N ploughed in the soil) and does not lead obviously to a reduction of the N advice for the following crop.

It was studied the 0 to 20 cm layer of an Oxisol (Dark Red Latosol) under the following treatments : soil under native cerrado, bare soil (five years) and the following green manure cultivated in the dry season, after corn (cv. Pioneer 3072) : #Crotalaria juncea$, #Cajanus cajan$, #Mucuna aterrima$ and #Brachiaria ruziziensis$. The adsorption values were adjusted to Langmuir isoterm for determination of P adsorption maximum capacity (PAMC). The general trend of the P maximum adsorption followed the order : discovered soil > #Cajanus cajan$ > #Crotalaria juncea$ > #Mucuna aterrima$ > #Brachiaria ruziziensis$ > native cerrado. Soil organic matter amount and green manure decomposition rate had negative correlation with the P maximum adsorption, with correlation coefficients of 0. 705 (P < 0. 06) and 0. 983 (P < 0. 01), respectively.

The three main systems tested after 2 years of upland rice cultivation were grass-alone pasture (Brachiaria dictyoneura), green manure (Crotalaria juncea), and maize (Zea mays). Native savanna treatment was used as a control. Intensive disc harrowing improved macroporosity values of 0 – 5 cm soil layer up to 59 % for grass-alone pasture system compared to native savanna. Disc harrowing significantly reduced bulk densities for pasture and green manure systems compared to the native savanna in the 0 – 5 cm soil layer. Intensive disc harrowing significantly improved volumetric moisture content of green manure and maize systems at 5 – 10 cm soil depth. The distribution of biologically, moderately and sparingly available P, organic P and total P varied under green manure, maize and grass-alone pasture systems. Two passes of disc harrow per year were sufficient for grass-alone pasture, while maize showed greater aboveground production and nutrient acquisition at 8 passes of disc harrow per year.

G 0 crops tended to immobilize soil mineral N in spring and generally had non-significant effects on the yields of potatoes and sugarbeet, whereas G 100, G 200 and RC increased the N yields and marketable yields significantly. Effects were mainly attributable to the release of N by the <b>green</b> <b>manures.</b> The fertilizer value of the <b>green</b> <b>manures</b> was evaluated by their effect on economic optimum N rates, the marketable yield and the N yield when no mineral fertilizer N was supplied.

Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 66 - 68). x, 68 leaves, bound col. ill. 29 cmIn Hawai'i, taro (Colocasia esculenta) is {{an important}} part of cultural, nutritional, and agricultural traditions. Soil-borne pathogens are responsible for significant losses in taro production systems. Meloidogyne javanica and Pythium aphanidermatum are pathogens found in dryland taro production systems that attack taro in Hawai'i. A sustainable method to control these pathogens in dryland taro cropping systems is warranted. Combining phytochemical producing <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> <b>cropping</b> systems that are toxic to pathogens with resistant cultivars can provide sustainable control of these pathogens. Ten green manure crops that produce pathogen toxic phytochemicals were screened for host status to M javanica. Interactive affects of M javanica, Pythium aphanidermatum, and 22 green manure crop species were also evaluated. Tagetes spp. were not hosts of M javanica, and were not affected by P. aphanidermatum, inoculating both pathogens concurrently reduced growth. Brassica spp. were good hosts to M javanica, and P. aphanidermatum. Sorghum X sudangrass varied in host status, but produced copious amounts of biomass in the presence of either pathogen alone or combined. The best candidate was Sorghum X Sudangrass Graze All ST. It had a low reproduction factor (Rf = 0. 19) and grew well inoculated with M javanica and Pythium aphanidermatum combined and individually. Taro gerrnplasm were screened for resistance to M javanica in the greenhouse. Of the 54 taro gerrnplasm screened, resistance remained elusive.

Wild oat (Avena fatua L.) and wild mustard (Brassica kaber (D. C.) L. C. Wheeler) were planted in weedy treatments to supplement the natural weed community. Biomass samples and soil moisture measurements were taken at early bud and full bloom to simulate when these crops would be terminated. Biomass samples from the early bud stage were analysed for total nitrogen content. <b>Green</b> <b>manure</b> biomass production for all species was lower under weedy conditions.

The experiment started by sowing of winter wheat so <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> <b>crop</b> was not grown in the first experimental year. The highest yield of winter wheat grain coming from {{the first year of}} the experiment was observed on the variant with renewable external sources (digestate). Average grain yield on this variant was about 7. 12 t/ha (up to 0. 74 t/ha increased than the unfertilized control). Average yield of potatoes from the second year of the experiment was the highest after combination with <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> + renewable external sources (compost + digestate) + auxiliary substances. This variant achieved yield about 34. 08 t/ha, which is increased by 9. 35 t/ha compared to the control variant. Results from this two-year experiment showed that the most suitable combination of fertilization with or without <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> <b>crop</b> is compost + digestate. These results were probably caused by higher content of nitrogen in organic fertilizers (compost + digestate) used in this variant compared to other variants. Statistical difference of achieved yields was observed between each experimental station in both experimental years...|$|R

50|$|Nitrogen {{deficiency}} can {{be prevented}} {{in the short term}} by using grass mowings as a mulch, or foliar feeding with manure, and in the longer term by building up levels of organic matter in the soil. Sowing <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> <b>crops</b> such as grazing rye to cover soil over the winter will help to prevent nitrogen leaching, while leguminous <b>green</b> <b>manures</b> such as winter tares will fix additional nitrogen from the atmosphere.|$|R
40|$|Today, {{well over}} 125, 000 farmers are using <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> and cover <b>crops</b> in Santa Catarina, Brazil. <b>Green</b> <b>manure</b> and cover <b>crops</b> are equally popular in {{neighbouring}} Parana and Rio Grande do Sul. In Central America and Mexico, an estimated 200, 000 farmers are using 20 traditional systems involving some 14 {{different species of}} <b>green</b> <b>manure</b> and cover <b>crops</b> and organisations from central Mexico to Nicaragua are promoting their use in at least 25 additional systems...|$|R
