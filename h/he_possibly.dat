5|$|James Caudy {{was born}} in 1707 in the Netherlands. <b>He</b> <b>possibly</b> arrived in the Thirteen Colonies through Prince George's County in the Province of Maryland in the 1730s. While in Prince George's County, Caudy married his first wife, Mary Hutchinson.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1940—one {{day after}} the {{official}} end of the Battle of Britain—he was killed in action. He took off and engaged a formation of German fighters, one of which <b>he</b> <b>possibly</b> shot down for his 22nd—albeit uncredited—and final victory. McKellar was then shot down himself.|$|E
5|$|Bregowine (died August 764) was {{a medieval}} Archbishop of Canterbury. Little {{is known of}} his origins or his {{activities}} as archbishop, although a number of stories were told about his possible origins after the Norman conquest in 1066. There are no records of him prior to his becoming archbishop. <b>He</b> <b>possibly</b> owed his elevation to the Kentish monarch. The records after his elevation to Canterbury are mainly about disputes over land, but knowledge {{of his time in}} office is hampered by the destruction of many of the contemporary records. After his death, he was considered a saint and a life about him was written in the 12thcentury.|$|E
50|$|It is {{not clear}} when and where <b>he</b> died. <b>Possibly</b> <b>he</b> died in England in or after 1674, the date of his last known print.|$|R
5000|$|Graziano {{is easily}} {{one of the}} most {{controversial}} Italian art directors no-code, although <b>he's</b> <b>possibly</b> the least comfortable fit in border line seminal. Traditional, also trash, naïve, cult, but still very old fashion. In 1972, Graziano began to work in comics at StudiOriga in Milan.|$|R

5|$|Back at the Eppes house, Charlie and Don {{discuss what}} went wrong. Alan is {{confident}} that the math is correct. Don tells Charlie that if Charlie ran his model on Don, the model will not show Don at his apartment. Instead, it would zone in on his office, where {{he spends most of}} his time. Charlie then realizes that he needs to modify his model to identify two hot zones, one where the suspect possibly resides and one where <b>he</b> <b>possibly</b> works. Using the new equation and a list of potential suspects who work in the new hot zone, Don, Terry, and David confront the suspect and find his latest victim. After Don kills the suspect in a hostage situation, he calls Charlie down to the crime scene to tell Charlie that the suspect lived in the original hot zone but moved three weeks earlier. This revelation proves that Charlie's models are correct.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} seventeenth music became less an {{accomplishment}} of the gentle classes and increasingly a skill pursued by professionals. It was enjoyed in otherwise silent concert rooms {{rather than as}} incidental entertainment in the houses of royalty and nobles. The German flute was probably introduced into Scotland {{towards the end of}} the seventeenth century. The Italian style of classical music was probably first brought to Scotland by the Italian cellist and composer Lorenzo Bocchi, who travelled to Scotland in the 1720s, introducing the cello to the country and then developing settings for Lowland Scots songs. <b>He</b> <b>possibly</b> had a hand in the first Scottish Opera, the pastoral The Gentle Shepherd, with libretto by Allan Ramsay. Music in Edinburgh prospered through the patronage of figures including the merchant Sir John Clerk of Penicuik, who was also a noted composer, violinist and harpiscordist. The growth of a musical culture in the capital was marked by the incorporation of the Musical Society of Edinburgh in 1728.|$|E
5|$|In {{possibly}} {{the last years}} of the 15th century, the Sanmicheli were involved in the stone decoration of the Caprioli chapel in the Church of San Giorgio, for which Cairano, almost simultaneously, prepared his Adoration, demonstrating for the first time outside of the Loggia a cooperation between the two studios. Bartolomeo Sanmicheli, {{at the beginning of the}} new century, attempted at this point to make a comeback in the local art scene with the Ark of San Tiziano of 1505, characterized by a strong decorative quality. <b>He</b> <b>possibly</b> also aspired to the commission of the ark of Sant'Apollonio, which had been up for grabs since the discovery of the relics of the holy bishop in 1503. An early involvement of Sanmicheli can be surmised in the Martinengo mausoleum, but the commission was awarded to Bernardino dei Crossi in 1503. However, based on the prevailing decorative nature of the monument, which is much more rigorously classical, it can be attributed to Cairano.|$|E

25|$|Liz and Pete {{have known}} each other since about 1996 and <b>he's</b> <b>possibly</b> the closest thing Liz has to a confidant besides Jack, {{especially}} since Jenna, her closest female friend, is far too anxious about her own life to function as such. Pete lived in Liz's apartment for an extended period while separated from his wife.|$|R
5|$|In {{the opening}} scene in which Michael puts his face in cement, the wet cement that was used was {{actually}} putty. The crew was planning to do only one take of Steve Carell putting {{his face in the}} putty, so he was instructed to hold his breath as long as <b>he</b> <b>possibly</b> could. But the crew forgot to tell the other actors about that, so during the filming of the scene, the actors thought he was actually stuck and there was a rush to pull him out. Kim M. Ferry, owner of the Nissan Xterra featured in the episode, is the show's Department Head Hairstylist. After it was used on the show, she decided to sell it on eBay. The listing was first put up on eBay on May 1, 2008, the night the episode aired.|$|E
5|$|Whether Neferhotep I usurped {{the throne}} {{at the expense}} of Sobekhotep III or {{inherited}} it, <b>he</b> <b>possibly</b> acceded to power over a fragmented Egypt. The Egyptologist Kim Ryholt believes that the Canaanite 14th Dynasty was already in existence at the time, forming an independent realm controlling at least the Eastern Nile Delta. This could explain why Neferhotep's only attestation in Lower Egypt is a single scarab seal. While this analysis is accepted by some scholars, among whom are Gae Callender, Janine Bourriau and Darrell Baker, it is rejected by others, including Manfred Bietak, Daphna Ben-Tor and James and Susan Allen, who contend that Neferhotep I reigned over the whole of Egypt. Possible vindications of this are the several attestations of Neferhotep found northeast of Egypt, in the Levant, in particular the stela of the Governor of Byblos Yantinu and 4 scarab seals from Canaan, indicating that he retained enough power to maintain trade relations with this region.|$|E
5|$|The secular popular {{tradition}} of music continued, despite {{attempts by the}} Kirk, particularly in the Lowlands, to suppress dancing and events like penny weddings at which tunes were played. Large numbers of musicians continued to perform, including the fiddler Pattie Birnie and the piper Habbie Simpson (1550–1620). In the Highlands the seventeenth century saw the development of piping families including the MacCrimmonds, MacArthurs, MacGregors and the Mackays of Gairlock. There is also evidence of adoption of the fiddle in the Highlands with Martin Martin noting in his A Description of the Western Isles of Scotland (1703) that he knew of eighteen in Lewis alone. The oppression of secular music and dancing began to ease between about 1715 and 1725 {{and the level of}} musical activity was reflected in a flood musical publications in broadsheets and compendiums of music such as the makar Allan Ramsay's verse compendium The Tea Table Miscellany (1723) and William Thomson's Orpheus Caledonius (1725). The Italian style of classical music was probably first brought to Scotland by the Italian cellist and composer Lorenzo Bocchi, who travelled to Scotland in the 1720s, introducing the cello to the country and then developing settings for lowland Scots songs. <b>He</b> <b>possibly</b> had a hand in the first Scottish Opera, the pastoral The Gentle Shepherd, with libretto by Allan Ramsay.|$|E

25|$|Tudur, Isabel and Lowri {{are given}} as his {{siblings}} {{by the more}} cautious Prof. R R Davies. That Owain Glyndŵr had another brother Gruffudd is likely; that <b>he</b> <b>possibly</b> had a third, Maredudd, is suggested by one reference.|$|E
25|$|William Henry Johnson may {{not have}} been a microcephalic; he may have merely had an oddly-shaped head. Additionally, <b>he</b> <b>possibly</b> did not suffer the mental {{retardation}} that microcephalics often suffer. There has been some interest in ascertaining Zip's actual mental capacity.|$|E
25|$|She {{was most}} likely born in year 4 of Akhenaten's reign and by year 12 of her father's reign she was joined by her three younger sisters. <b>He</b> <b>possibly</b> made his wife his co-regent and had his family portrayed in a {{realistic}} style in all official artwork.|$|E

5000|$|Eurymedon: According to Homer, {{he was a}} king of the Giants {{and father}} of Periboea (mother of Nausithous, king of the Phaeacians, by Poseidon), who [...] "brought {{destruction}} on his froward people". <b>He</b> was <b>possibly</b> the Eurymedon who raped Hera producing Prometheus as offspring. He is probably named on Akropolis 2134. <b>He</b> is <b>possibly</b> mentioned by the Latin poet Propertius as an opponent of Jove.|$|R

25|$|Contains {{material}} {{collected from the}} Near East. The material was collected between 1863 and 1865. Firkovich collected in Jerusalem, Aleppo and also in Cairo. Firkovich concealed where he obtained the documents. <b>He</b> <b>possibly</b> collected from the Cairo Geniza thirty years before Solomon Schechter discovered it. Firkovich sold this collection to the lmperial Public Library in 1873.|$|E
25|$|In 1499 João Fernandes Lavrador was {{licensed}} by the King of Portugal and together with Pêro de Barcelos they first sighted Labrador, which was granted and named after him. After returning <b>he</b> <b>possibly</b> went to Bristol to sail {{in the name of}} England. Nearly at the same time, between 1499 and 1502 brothers Gaspar and Miguel Corte Real explored and named the coasts of Greenland and also Newfoundland. Both explorations are noted in the 1502 Cantino planisphere.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} collision, Ville du Havre's main and mizzen masts collapsed, smashing {{two of the}} liner's life boats and killing several people. The time for saving life was very short as the ship sank in less than 12 minutes, and finally broke into two pieces as she went. Captain Robertson of the Loch Earn did all <b>he</b> <b>possibly</b> could to rescue the {{drowning}} and eventually 61 passengers and 26 of the crew were rescued and taken on board that ship. However, 226 passengers and crew perished.|$|E

50|$|According to the RKD <b>he</b> was <b>possibly</b> {{the pupil}} of Felix van Sambix. He married Mayken van Bracht, {{sister-in-law}} of the publisher Jan van Waesberghe, in 1592 in Rotterdam {{and opened a}} French school there. He published his calligraphy in the Spieghel der Schrijfkonste in 1605. In 1620 moved to Haarlem, where <b>he</b> was <b>possibly</b> the teacher of the Haarlem calligraphers Jean de la Chambre or Nicolaes Bodding van Laer.|$|R
25|$|On Fremont Street, {{they ran}} into Cochise County Sheriff Behan, who told them or implied that he had {{disarmed}} the cowboys. To avoid alarming citizens and lessen tension when disarming the cowboys, Virgil gave the coach gun to Holliday so he could conceal it under his long coat. Virgil Earp took Holliday's walking stick. The lawmen found the cowboys in a narrow 15– to 20-ft-wide lot on Fremont Street, between Fly's boarding house and the Harwood house. Holliday was boarding at Fly's house and <b>he</b> <b>possibly</b> thought they were waiting there to kill him.|$|E
25|$|In 1675-1676 {{he again}} {{narrowly}} survived a costly shipwreck on the island's shores. Morgan {{had been appointed}} Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica and {{was on his way}} from England to take up the post. <b>He</b> <b>possibly</b> headed for Isla Vaca to salvage what he could from the sunken ships of the 1669 incident. But a storm arose and sank his ship Jamaica Merchant, which was loaded with a full complement of cannon which he had been bringing to bolster the defenses at Port Royal. This ship has been found by researchers, who have recovered dishes, bronze coins, and the ship's anchor.|$|E
25|$|All the {{hermeneutic}} rules scattered {{through the}} Talmudim and Midrashim {{have been collected}} by Malbim in Ayyelet HaShachar, the introduction to his commentary on the Sifra, and have been reckoned at 613, to correspond with the 613 commandments. The antiquity of the rules can be determined only by the dates of the authorities who quote them, meaning that they cannot safely be declared older than the tanna to whom they are first ascribed. It is certain, however, that the seven middot of Hillel and the 13 of Rabbi Ishmael are earlier than the time of Hillel himself, {{who was the first}} to transmit them. At all events, he did not invent them, but merely collected them as current in his day, though <b>he</b> <b>possibly</b> amplified them. They were not immediately recognized by all as valid and binding. Different schools interpreted and modified them, restricting or expanding them, in various ways.|$|E
