40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarIn {{this report}} {{monitoring}} {{results of the}} National Air Quality Monitoring Network are presented covering the calendar year 1989 and the period April 1988 - April 1989. The components reported are SO 2, black smoke, NO 2, NOx (= NO 2 + NO), NO, O 3, OX (= NO 2 + O 3), and CO. In 1989 several summer smog episodes occurred which contributed to exceedence of Dutch air quality limit values for NO 2 on a few stations. However exceedence of the Dutch draft limit values for O 3 were not detected. At a few stations the limit values for black smoke were exceeded and at one station the maximal allowable hour value was exceeded once caused by an incidental polluting activity. <b>Guide</b> <b>values</b> for SO 2 and NO 2 were exceeded at 6 % and 80 % resp. {{of the total number}} of stations.

Attention is next directed to the definition of what the authors call scholarly practice and its interaction with scholarly outlets such as journals, conference proceedings and professional development. Reflecting the now longstanding call for student affairs and academic affairs professionals to unite in service of facilitating student development and learning, the authors propose a set of <b>guiding</b> <b>values</b> for student affairs administrators that promote data- and theory-based intentionality of practice. These <b>guiding</b> <b>values</b> also require continual professional reflection and renewal, including actively interacting with journals and other peer-reviewed professional outlets.

SUMMARY This study evaluated the degree of color change of teeth and the sensitivities of teeth and gums in an in vivo study.

Color evaluations occurred at baseline, after five and seven-day use of bleaching agent and 14 days post-bleaching. Color change was evaluated objectively and sub-jectively.
