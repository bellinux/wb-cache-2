40|$|A low {{efficiency}} of bull <b>fattening</b> <b>resulted</b> in {{a decrease of}} beef production in Poland. One of the possibilities of the improvement of fattening efficiency is a proper choice of decisions concerning {{the course of a}} fattening process. Making the optimal decisions can be supported by means of dynamic programming (DP) models, using the hierarchic Markov process (HMP) technique. The models developed in the presented study optimize decisions with respect to time of the termination of fattening process in various production approaches including: breed, scale of production and intensity of fattening. Key words: young bulls, fattening, economic optimization, dynamic programming models, hierarchic Markov process I.

Between 15 - 20 projects where obtained in each of the 12 regional branches covering the national territory. Fifteen different types of deficiencies where found. The most frequent deficiencies found were: the use of nominal interest rates, (100 %), omission to include production costs (44 %) including incomes from other activities (43 %), and high calving rates (25 %). The number of deficiencies per type of project was of 5. 5 in the case of enterprises dealing with double purpose production (beef-milk); 6. 3 for cow-calf production, and 6. 5 for pasture <b>fattening.</b> <b>Results</b> were highly significant for the deficiencies by branches and significant for type of project. No statistical differences were found in relation to the year of preparation. There are statistical differences (P< 0. 05) in deficiencies found between double purpose and cow-calf projects as well as between double purpose and pasture fattening. The exaggerated frequency of deficiencies, together with the fact that they were not detected by regular institutional supervision mechanisms, shows an obvious failure of these mechanisms but more over, it shows the possibility that these deficiencies are considered by the institution as â€œaccepted problemsâ€ or â€œunderstood valuesâ€, since there are other priorities regarding credit policies such as use of nominal interests rates, short amortization periods, etc. Credit, livestock projects, project quality., Agribusiness,...|$|R

Insulin-pathway signaling and mTORC 1 genes may contribute to incred IR. The first objective of this study was to find and validate internal control genes for quantitative PCR method for adipose tissues in Finnhorse mares. The second aim was to quantitate the expression of mTORC 1 and insulin-pathway associated genes after pasture season in two different treatment groups of Finnhorse mares and compare gene expression differences between treatment groups. In addition, gene expression differences were compared between two different adipose tissues. Twenty-two mares were equally divided into eleven equal pairs, the two mares of each group were randomly grazed either on cultivated high-yielding pasture (CG) or on semi-natural grassland (NG) from the end of May to the beginning of September. Eight pairs of Finnhorse mares were selected for gene expression profiling. Subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) samples were collected from two groups of Finnhorse mares after pasture season. Gene expression of neck and tailhead SAT were determined with quantitative Real-Time PCR method (qPCR). The selected internal control genes were actin beta (ACTB), glucuronidase beta (GUSB) and mitochondrial ribosomal protein L 39 (MRPL 39). Candidate genes were mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR), sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF 1), sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 2 (SREBF 2), TBC 1 domain family member 7 (TBC 1 D 7), leptin (LEP), glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT 4), monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1), retinol binding protein 4 (RBP 4), tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC 1), tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC 2). There were no distinct gene expression differences between NG and CG groups in both neck and tailhead SAT. However, RBP 4 had significantly (P= 0. 035) higher and GLUT 4 had a trend (P= 0. 064) to higher mRNA expression in CG group in neck SAT. TSC 1 had a trend (P= 0. 071) of higher expression in CG group in tailhead SAT. Gene expression differences were observed between tailhead and neck SAT. SREBF 1 and GLUT 4 had significantly (P= 0. 007 and P= 0. 026, respectively) higher expression levels in tailhead SAT compared to neck SAT. RBP 4 had a trend (P= 0. 066) to higher expression in neck SAT compared to tailhead SAT. Minor differences in gene expression between NG and CG groups indicate that pasture-associated fat depositionmaynotconsiderably affect expressionof insulin-pathway and mTORC 1 genes associated to obesity and IR in studied subcutaneous adipose tissues. These results also provide additional evidence to our hypothesis that <b>fattening</b> <b>resulting</b> on unrestricted grazing on cultivated high-yielding pasture does not increase the risk of metabolic diseases in Finnhorse mares when they have normal body condition at the beginning of the grazing season...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the mortality in <b>fattened</b> cattle <b>resulting</b> from transport to a slaughterhouse, and to examine the effect of both travel distance and the season of the year on the mortality rate in fattened cattle during transport. The mortality rate in fattened cattle during transport to a slaughterhouse that were monitored in the Czech Republic in the period of 1997 - 2004 was 0. 007 % ± 0. 003 %.

40|$|For {{induction}} of fat deposit in meat, hypothyroidism is {{the most}} important factor. This study was carried out to confirm the effect of glucocorticoid on thyroidal function, using rats. Triamcinolone acetonid, a synthetic compound was used as glucocorticoid. Rats of an experimental group were injected singly subcutaneously with 0. 9 mg of the compound and another group of rats served as control. The animals were sacrificed by decapitating at 2 hours and 4 hours following the injection. At the time of decapitating, blood was obtained from the animal respectively. A half portion of the blood serum was used for determination of such blood components as total protein (TP), albumin (Alb), globulin (Gl), blood ureal nitrogen (BUN), glucose(Glu), cholesterol (Chol), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and phosphorus (P). Another half portion of the serum was subjected to amino acid analysis, using a automatic amino acid analyzer. By injection of the glucocorticoid, concentrations of TP, Alb, and Gl decreased, and concentration of amino acids increased. This is due to gluconeogenesis induced by glucocorticoid. Serum phosphorus was elevated, and ratio of Ca/P decreased and P/Mg increased. These are indicative of lowered thyroidal function. Accordingly, glucocorticoid seemed to have a favourable effect on <b>fattening</b> cattle. <b>Results</b> of amino acid assay were summarized in Table 2. Most of amino acids increased by the injection of the compound, except glutamic acid and taurine. This is due to protein catabolism and gluconeogenesis. Concentration of serum glucose consistently increased. Increase of glycine concentration in serum is indicative of hyperthyroidism. This is, however, due to neoglucogenesis by cortisol. Low concentration of Mg is indicative of hyperthyroidism. Further study for the effect of glucocorticoid would be required, since glucocorticoid is considered to accelerate production of lean meat...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} data {{augmentation}} in feature space is considered. A new architecture, denoted the FeATure TransfEr Network (FATTEN), is {{proposed for the}} modeling of feature trajectories induced by variations of object pose. This architecture exploits a parametrization of the pose manifold in terms of pose and appearance. This leads to a deep encoder/decoder network architecture, where the encoder factors into an appearance and a pose predictor. Unlike previous attempts at trajectory transfer, FATTEN can be efficiently trained end-to-end, with no need to train separate feature transfer functions. This is realized by supplying the decoder with information about a target pose {{and the use of}} a multi-task loss that penalizes category- and pose-mismatches. In <b>result,</b> <b>FATTEN</b> discourages discontinuous or non-smooth trajectories that fail to capture the structure of the pose manifold, and generalizes well on object recognition tasks involving large pose variation. Experimental results on the artificial ModelNet database show that it can successfully learn to map source features to target features of a desired pose, while preserving class identity.

Experimental <b>results</b> showed that colloid-facilitated transport of SMOX was significant {{in the presence of}} manure colloids from fattening pigs with low C/N ratio, high SUVA 280 nm and protein C, while manure colloids from sows and farrows and weaners had little effect on SMOX transport. In contrast, only retardation was observed for SDZ and SMPD when manure colloids were present. Breakthrough curves (BTCs) of colloids and SAs were replicated well by a newly developed numerical model that considers colloid-filtration theory, competitive kinetic sorption, and co-transport processes. Model results demonstrate that mobile colloids act as carriers for SMOX, while immobile colloids block SMOX from sorbing onto the soil. The low affinity of SMOX to sorb on immobile colloids prevents aggregation and also promotes SMOX's colloid-facilitated transport. Conversely, the high affinity of SDZ and SMPD to sorb on all types of immobile colloids retarded their transport. Thus, manure properties play a fundamental role in increasing the leaching risk of hydrophobic sulfonamides...|$|R

To boost profits, nearly everyone pursue cost cutting. However, aggressive cost cutting as the sole approach to <b>fattening</b> margins <b>results</b> invariably in a reduction of operational capabilities which is likely to result in a decline in sales volume that leads to further cost reductions in a continuous death spiral. Long-term profitable growth requires, instead, a continuous flow of innovative products and processes. The focus should be, therefore, shifted from cost reduction to increased throughput. Automotive companies need to change their business model, morphing into new organizational entities based on systems thinking and change, which are agile and can swiftly adapt to the new business environment. The advancement of technology and the relentless increase in computing power will provide the necessary means for this radical transformation. This transformation cannot happen if the Product Development Process (PDP) does not break the iron gate of cycle time-product cost-development expenses-reduced product performance that constrains it. A new approach to PD should be applied to the early phases, where the leverage is higher, and should be targeted to dramatic reduction of the time taken to perform design iterations, which, by taking 50 - 70 % of the total development time, are a burden of today's practice. Multi-disciplinary Design(cont.) Analysis and Optimization, enabled by an Integrated Concurrent Engineering virtual product development framework has the required characteristics and the potential to respond to today's and tomorrow's automotive challenges. In this new framework, the product or system is not defined by a rigid CAD model which is then manipulated by product team engineers, but by a parametric flexible architecture handled by optimization and analysis software, with limited user interaction. In this environment, design engineers govern computer programs, which automatically select appropriately combinations of geometry parameters and drive seamlessly the analyses software programs (structural, fluid dynamic, costing, etc) to compute the system's performance attributes. Optimization algorithms explore the design space, identifying the Pareto optimal set of designs that satisfy the multiple simultaneous objectives they are given {{and at the same time}} the problem's constraints. Examples of application of the MDO approach to automotive systems are multiplying. However, the number of disciplines and engineering aspects considered is still limited to few (two or three) thus not exploiting the full potential the approach deriving from multi-disciplinarity. In the present work, a prototype of an Enhanced Development Framework has been set up for a particular automotive subsystem: a maniverter (a combination of exhaust manifold and catalytic converter) for internal combustion engines [...] . by Massimo Usan.

40|$|Gonadotropin {{releasing}} hormone (GnRH) plays {{a pivotal role}} in fertility and reproduction in mammals. It induces the release of luteinising hormone (LH) en follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary. These hormones are responsible for gonadal steroid production and indirectly for gametogenesis. In this thesis, studies are presented which described the development of a highly immunogenic GnRH antigen, as well as the evaluation of this antigen in vaccines in target species. The native GnRH peptide was enlarged to a GnRH-tandem peptide and immunogenicity was further increased by dimerization of the peptide and introduction of foreign amino acids (G 6 k-GnRH-tandem-dimer). This modified peptide construct was conjugated to ovalbumine. It appeared to be highly effective in immunosterilization, i. e. blocking testosterone production, in male piglets. The role of the individual amino acids of the G 6 k-GnRH-tandem-dimer on immunosterilization efficacy was established, using alanine replacements. All amino acids, except amino acids at position 2 and 3, could be individually replaced by alanine without affecting efficacy of the vaccine. Peptides with alanine replacements at position 1 or 4 did induce antibodies that were specific for GnRH and did not cross-react with other GnRH-isoforms present in mammals. Immunosterilization by vaccination against GnRH could be a suitable alternative for surgical castration in male piglets. Surgical castration prevents boar taint, but is an animal unfriendly practice, as it is performed without anaesthesia. Immunosterilization may also be beneficial for growth performance. Effects of the time of onset of effective immunosterilization on growth performance were studied. Effective immunosterilization early during the <b>fattening</b> period <b>resulted</b> in a growth performance similar to surgical castrates. In contrast, when immunosterilization was initiated late during the fattening period, growth performance was improved over surgical castrates and carcass quality appeared to be similar to intact male pigs. In addition, immunosterilized pigs of both groups could easily be distinguished from intact male pigs by the size of their testes. Two vaccines with the G 6 k-GnRH-tandem-dimer antigen in CoVaccine and Carbopol adjuvant were evaluated in sexually mature male ponies. The CoVaccine-treated stallions showed a high antibody response after the second vaccination, subsequently leading to undetectable testosterone levels and affected testis function, while effects in the Carbopol group were only present in one of the four stallions treated. In humane medicine, GnRH vaccination could be an alternative for hormone therapy in prostate cancer patients. Two potential vaccines with the antigen in ISA 51 and in CoVaccine adjuvant were studied in pigs. The latter vaccine appeared to be more effective. It reduced testosterone levels, weights of testes and accessory sex glands in all treated animals. Both vaccines can be considered as non-toxic; no chronic abnormalities were observed in blood, urine, organs or tissues. In conclusion, this vaccine could be a suitable alternative for surgical castration in pigs, eventually leading to a ban on this animal unfriendly practice in the EU. In human medicine, GnRH vaccination could replace hormone therapy in diseases driven by gonadal steroids. In prostate cancer for instance, GnRH vaccination may be a long term effective, cheap and safe alternative...|$|R

40|$|Beef {{production}} from dairy herds represents an alternative source {{to improve the}} farm profitability. The use of beef semen to mate cattle not destined to breed replacement represent an interesting {{source of income for}} dairy farmers particularly due to the greater price and value of crossbreed calves respect purebred calves at sale. Unfortunately this practice has been decreasing in the last years in the more specialized herds of the Po valley mainly due to fertility and longevity problems of the high productivity dairy cattle. However, on the mountain area, were farms are characterized by less productivity but high longevity and fertility of their cattle, the low replacement rate permitted each year the use of beef sire to mate a considerable number of cattle not destined to breed replacement. In the Trentino area (North of Italy) every week the breeding federation collected calves from associated dairy herds and the best of these for beef traits, following weaning at specialized farms, were fattened at local associated fattening farms. After fattening, young bulls and heifers are slaughtered at the same abattoir and the meat are sold at the central butchers and to the entire cooperative wire markets of the Province. This meat is sold with a certified mark that guarantee birth, fattening and slaughtering of the animals in the same area. Moreover, weekly, the breeding Federation of Trento province collected cull cows from associated dairy herds too and these cattle are sold to an associated abattoir. The aim of the present thesis were to study production and economic traits from the whole beef output from dairy herds in mountain area; the first contribute of the thesis analyzed production and economic traits of slaughtered cull cows while the second and the third contributes analyzed production and selling traits of calves at sale (average 24 days of age). Finally the last contribute studied production and economic traits of young bulls and heifers at slaughter respect the purchase beginning value of calf. Results of first contribute evidenced that the value of cull cows at slaughter represents a significant source of income for the dairy farm and the large differences among different breeds for cull cow value suggests its possible inclusion in the selection objectives of these breeds. Holstein-Friesian cows were younger at slaughter, yielded lighter carcasses and received a lower price and total value than Brown Swiss cows while dual purpose breeds were older, heavier and received a greater price and value at slaughter than both dairy breeds. Results from the study that analyzed calves traits had evidenced that the dual-purpose purebred calves received, on average, greater price and value at sale than purebred dairy calves. Furthermore, among crossbreed calves, the progeny from Belgian Blue sire and Simmental dam evidenced the greatest live weight and selling values. Moreover, results evidenced that the majority of purebred calves from dairy dams were most likely destined for veal production while many dual-purpose calves were most likely destined for beef production as well as the vast majority of beef crossbreed calves. Results from the final contribute evidenced that crossbred young bulls and beef heifers from Belgian Blue sires and Simmental dam achieved the highest carcass weight and the best daily gain and carcass value. The best economic revenue was achieved by Simmental bulls among purebred animals, and by Belgian Blue sire x Holstein Friesian dams, among crossbreed animals. This is mainly related to less purchase value of calves {{at the beginning of the}} <b>fattening</b> period. <b>Results</b> might be useful for the farmers as guideline to quantify an alternative source of income and to improve the farm profitability obtained from beef production in dairy herds. ...|$|R

The results of husbandry practices indicated that illiteracy among camel owners was 48. 6 % and among shepherd was 56 %. Average herd size was 85. 1 heads and breeding females represented 74. 2 % while breeding males amounted to 25. 2 %. The study revealed that sheep and goats were also raised beside camels. Castration of male camels was practiced for fattening purposes by 40 % of the farmers. The majority of the herders practiced seasonal migration to the northern and southern parts of north Kordofan state. The study indicated the presence of twelve major camel diseases, and local medicine was extensively practiced in combating diseases. Most of the farmers (75. 4 %) indicated the use of the money returns from selling of camels for other activities rather than adding new animals to their herds. Effect of season on contractile and metabolic properties of Longissimus thoracis muscle was carried out on thirty <b>fattened</b> camels. The <b>results</b> revealed that season significantly influenced muscle chemical composition, ultimate pH (pHu) and color (P< 0. 01).

XIII + 64 % and oxidative isocitrate dehydrogenase was + 145 % in autumn and summer. Quantification of muscle myosin heavy chain isoforms indicated high proportion of type I in winter and type II in autumn (P< 0. 001). The study revealed that aging of camel longissimus thoracis muscle significantly influenced its chemical composition except ash (P< 0. 001). Dry matter and weep loss increased significantly while moisture and protein contents decreased. No differences were found in muscle pH, color and WHC while fat peroxidation showed insignificant increase and high levels of vitamin E were found during aging (16. 4, 24. 5, 12. 8 and 18. 4 μg/ g muscle). Sex revealed no significant differences in total intramuscular fat, insoluble OH proline as well as total OH proline content.

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to prevent tail biting in pigs, tail docking is often carried out. As this {{management}} procedure is painful for the pigs, it can be questioned if pigs can be raised with intact tails and whether they benefit from an enriched environment. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate the behavior and performance of fattening pigs with intact tails in an enriched environment and fattening pigs in a more barren environment. A total of 94 pigs with different genetic backgrounds (type C pigs: predisposed to better carcass traits vs. type G: predisposed to better growth) were followed up during the fattening period (30 – 110 kg). Half of these pigs (n = 48) were housed in four barren control pens (a hanging toy as enrichment). The other half of the pigs (n = 46) were housed in four enriched pens (a hanging toy, straw blocks in a dispenser and a hiding wall). Type C and type G pigs were equally spread over these treatments, but were housed separately (n = 2 pens/type/treatment). Behavioral observations were carried out once a week and the presence of skin lesions were recorded every 14 days. Pigs were weighed individually on four occasions (start of the study, 6 and 12 weeks later and at slaughter), and simultaneously, tail lengths were also measured. The results revealed a general higher frequency of ear biting compared to tail biting in both barren and enriched pens. However, a higher frequency of tail biting was observed in enriched pens in the period between weight 3 and slaughter (90 – 110 kg) compared to barren pens. Pigs in enriched pens may have been more restricted in their movements around the pen during the last stage of the fattening phase due to weight gain and the presence of a hiding wall resulting in increased frustration and increased tail biting. This higher frequency of tail biting in enriched pens was mainly observed in type G pigs, while no difference between barren and enriched pens was found for type C pigs, indicating that the genetic background of the pigs should be considered when possible causes of a tail biting outbreak will be identified. Pigs in enriched pens had a higher average daily weight gain over the entire fattening period. Pigs predisposed to better growth (type G) had a higher average daily weight gain and longer tails than pigs predisposed to better carcass traits at the start of the fattening stage. However, daily weight gain and daily growth rate of the tail over the entire fattening stage did not differ between pig types. In conclusion, the presence of straw dispensers and a hiding wall did not contribute to a lower frequency of biting behavior and aggressive behavior. Moreover, tail biting increased in enriched pens during the last period of the <b>fattening</b> stage. The <b>results</b> suggest that the genetic background of the pig should be taken into account, as this factor might influence the pig’s behavior. status: accepte...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe organic steer production on farm level. Six Danish organic farms were part of the registration program including 3 dairy farmers and 3 crop farmers buying dairy breed bull calves from organic dairy farmers. All farmers had a steer production, some of them were recently started and some had an established steer production. The experiment endured 2 years from January 2000 to April 2002. Registrations included liveweight, feed consumption, welfare and slaughter results with special emphasis on the fattening period. Welfare registrations were based on a scheme describing the system as well as the animal during winter when stabled in the barn and during summer on pasture. Registrations were measured on the system as well on the animals. Daily gain on pasture varied from 533 to 823 g and covers grazing on ryegrass/clover pastures as well as marginal grazing areas. On most of the farms steers grazed both kind of pastures. Gains during the stable period varied from 562 to 867 g/day between the farms. Feed consumption per steer per year was 1770 SFU ± 186 based on 4 farms. Feed consumption in summer accounted 0. 47 to 0. 57 of total feed consumption (DM) per year. Pasture accounts for 0. 22 to 0. 56 and concentrates for 0. 16 to 0. 37 of the total dry matter (DM) consumption per year. Management strategies concerning the fattening of steers were different between the 6 farms, as liveweight (458 - 595 kg) and age (20 - 25 months) at start of fattening and at slaughter (565 - 667 kg and 23 - 28 months) and length of fattening period (2. 3 - 3. 4 months) varied. Feeding during the fattening period was based on 1. 3 to 4. 7 Scandinavian Feed Units (SFU) concentrates per steer per day and silage ad libitum. The total amount of cereals consumed in the fattening period was 100 - 357 kg/steer. Only few steers were fattened on pasture. It seemed that whole crop silage is preferred to grass silage in the <b>fattening</b> period. Slaughter <b>results</b> show a variation between farms in slaughter percentage from 49. 4 to 53. 8, carcass conformation from 3. 5 to 4. 9 and fatness from 2. 5 to 3. 2. Liveweight at slaughter was the only variable with general effect on carcass conformation on 5 farms (0. 6 point on the EUROP-scale with increase in 100 kg liveweight at slaughter). The welfare registration scheme indicates good conditions both in the barn and on pasture, low disease rate and minor problems concerning welfare aspects in organic steer production. It is concluded that great variation between farms concerning management strategies shows the possibilities for improving the production system. Fattening strategy should focus on liveweight at slaughter. Length of fattening period as well as daily gain during the fattening period in the range practiced on the farms seemed to be of minor importance with regard to carcass conformation...|$|R

40|$|Prediction of pig {{performance}} from data on nutrient intake and animal properties {{makes it easier}} to obtain a better productivity. It provides tools to arrive at desired outputs, or to calculate required inputs. Thus it enables production to be flexible, safe and less erratic. It is to be expected that the results will give a more profitable pig production. In practice, different types of models are used, mostly by feed producers, but also in farm management programmes. Each of these existing models was designed to meet a certain objective. The classification of different types of models, and the benefits of using them, are presented in the literature overview of the thesis. After a general overview of modelling, a critical evaluation was provided on existing models. It was concluded from the literature, that a comprehensive model, which predicts the chemical composition {{in different parts of the}} body, like in lean or in the meat, does not exist. It was also concluded that mechanistic approach should be used to modelling growth. The conceptual basis of a mechanistic model was developed in accordance with basic properties of protein and lipid metabolism. Since nutrients are almost exclusively absorbed in the hydrolyzed form, simulation of use of nutrients for growth should, at least to some extent, make use of biochemical pathways. Therefore, a biological approach to simulation of anatomical body composition is pretended as it follows nutrients from ingestion through intermediary metabolism to deposition as body fat and protein, preferably in distinct tissues or tissue groups. Prediction of anatomical body composition therefore has to be based on deposition of the chemical entities. Therefore the scope of the present thesis was 1) to develop a mechanistic-dynamic model for growing and fattening pigs which predicts anatomical and chemical body composition at slaughter; 2) to determine which model parameters are sensitive to changes in the model; 3) to determine the model accuracy by quantitative and qualitative prediction of the model tested with independent data; 4) to complete an experiment to define fat production potential of different energy sources at low and high feeding levels, and 5) to study the effect of different energy sources at two feeding levels on the distribution of fat deposition during the fattening period. The thesis presents both the description and the evaluation of the growth model. It was concluded that the developed model predicts growth rate as well as chemical and anatomical body compositions of gilts in the 20 - 105 kg live weight range, from nutrient intake. The model represents partitioning of nutrients from feed intake through intermediary metabolism to synthesis of body protein and body fat. State variables of the model are lysine, acetyl-CoA equivalents, glucose, VFA, and fatty acids as metabolite pools, as well as protein in muscle, hide, bone and viscera and body fat as body constituent pools. It is assumed that fluxes of metabolites follow saturation kinetics depending on metabolite concentrations. Anatomical body composition is predicted from chemical body composition and accretion. Partitioning of protein, fat, water and ash into muscle, organs, hide and bone fractions are described by allometric equations, driven by rates of muscle protein and body fat deposition. Two experiments were used in the model calibration process, one with 95 growing pigs (20 - 45 kg) fed different ileal digestible lysine intakes at two feeding levels, and another with 100 growing and fattening pigs (20 - 105 kg), which received different energy intakes. Differential equations were solved numerically for a given set of initial conditions and parameter values. The integration interval used was 0. 01 day, with the fourth-order fixed-step-length Runge-Kutta algorithm. The muscle protein and body fat deposition rates were considered in different weight ranges and for the whole <b>fattening</b> period. <b>Results</b> presented were not sensitive to small changes in initial conditions, or to smaller integration step sizes. In the model evaluation the predicted response of the pigs to changes in model parameters, and to changes in nutrient intakes, are shown. As a result of the sensitivity analysis, the model was responsive to changes in a number of the model parameters examined. Changes in maintenance energy requirements, and the fractional degradation rate of muscle protein, have the largest impact on tissue deposition rates. The model is highly sensitive to changes in the maximal velocity and steepness parameter of lysine utilisation for muscle protein synthesis. Those parameters which directly affect the size of the lysine pool generally have a considerable influence on model predictions. Furthermore, it should be noted that results of this sensitivity analysis depend on nutrient intakes of the reference simulation. The model was relatively insensitive to changes of parameters regarding energy metabolism. It was concluded that the probable reason was that protein and/or lysine was more limiting within the simulated conditions. The model was further tested by independent published data. In general, the model satisfactorily predicted qualitative pig responses to a wide range of variations in nutrient supply. The predicted chemical and anatomical body composition, and also the distribution of protein and fat, were satisfactory in model testing. In most cases, errors in the predicted parameters attributed to the deviation of the regression slope were minor. It was assumed that the major factors contributing to the relatively large bias, observed for most predicted growth characteristics, was variation in pig performance among genotypes, or differences in environmental conditions. Based on the comparison of model simulations with independent data sets, it was recommended to improve the model regarding prediction of protein and fat deposition rates from nutrient intake of different energy sources. It was found that literature data on the effect of different energy sources on fat deposition was limited. In non-protein energy fraction of the diet, dietary lipids, starch and rapidly fermentable non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) are major energy sources. Lipids are absorbed as long-chain fatty acids and starch as glucose. Dietary NSP is fermented and the short-chain fatty acids produced enter intermediary metabolism as an energy source. Equal intakes of energy from glucose, long-chain fatty acids and short-chains fatty acids might result in different fat deposition rates, and quite likely, result in different distributions of body fat over the tissues. There is, however, little quantitative data available on effects of energy source on partitioning of body lipids. Therefore a fattening trial was completed to: 1) study the effect of extra energy intake from fermentable NSP, digestible starch and digestible fat used for fat deposition under protein limiting conditions; 2) determine the location of the fat deposition resulting from extra intake fermentable NSP, digestible starch and digestible fat; 3) determine if the extra fat deposition from different energy sources depends on the level of feed intake, and 4) quantify potential interactions between feed intake level and energy source on the location of extra body fat deposition. A total of 58 hybrid individually housed pigs were used in the trial with an initial body weight of 48 ± 4 kg. The experimental treatments were arranged in a 3 x 2 factorial design, with three energy sources (i. e. fermentable NSP, digestible starch and digestible fat, all added to a control diet) at each of two energy levels. Within each energy level, daily nutrient intakes were the same with regard to digestible protein, ileal digestible lysine and other amino acids, vitamins and minerals. Treatments had an isocaloric proportion of daily nutrient intake derived from each energy source (0. 2 MJ DE/kg 0. 75), in addition to the nutrients from control diet. It was equal with 11 g/kg 0. 75 highly fermentable NSP, 11 g/kg 0. 75 starch or 5 g/kg 0. 75 digestible fat daily. The DE intakes were 2. 0 and 3. 0 maintenance requirement in control groups. The additional energy from different sources increased DE intake up to 2. 4 and 3. 4 times maintenance requirement at low and high feeding levels, respectively. To obtain   initial values, ten pigs were slaughtered at 48 ± 4 kg and the treatment pigs at 106 ± 3 kg body weight. Each body was dissected into four fractions being: 1) lean, 2) organs, 3) hide and subcutaneous fat, and 4) offal. Chemical body composition was determined in each body fraction. The differences between fat deposition of body parts in the control group, and the other treatments, resulted in the additional energy derived from each energy source. As a conclusion from the study, under protein limiting conditions, extra energy intake from fermentable NSP, digestible starch and digestible fat resulted in similar fat deposition. Preferential deposition of extra energy intake in various fat depots did not depend on the energy source. The extra fat deposition from fermentable NSP, digestible starch and digestible fat deposited as body fat was similar at both the low and high levels of feed intake. In the General Discussion, some consequences of the mechanistic approach were discussed and then substantial attention was devoted to the practical aspects of the model. The later part of the General Discussion focuses on representation of different energy sources as an aspect of the model. The energetic efficiency of the different dietary energy sources is discussed, based on data from Chapter 6. The growth model is further evaluated by <b>results</b> of the <b>fattening</b> study. Moreover, data from the fattening study are analysed regarding the distribution of fat deposition. Consequences of the fattening study on the model is discussed regarding the effect of energy sources on energetic efficiency, and on location of fat deposition in the pig. Finally, a new application of the present model is introduced in addition to development of feeding strategies and identifying research priorities...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} years {{increasing}} {{attention has been paid}} to ventilation in piggeries and to the influence of climatic factors in the piggery on the growth of fattening pigs. It was necessary to accumulate more information on the heat and water vapour production of pigs in order to enable the construction of piggeries with climatic conditions for optimal production. For that reason an investigation into the influence of different temperatures on the heat production of growing pigs was started. The animals were kept singly with two pigs each in a metabolism cage or in groups of 4 - 5 pigs in one chamber. The experiments were performed in two new climatic chambers of the department of Animal Physiology of the Agricultural University at Wageningen. These chambers were constructed for respiration trials. These investigations were performed in a close cooperation between this Department and the Department of Animal Husbandry. In order to obtain data on the energy metabolism of pigs which could be compared as much as possible with conditions in husbandry practice, the animals stayed inside the respiration-climatic chamber during their whole fattening period from about 20 to 100 kg. To investigate the temperature influence the following scheme was designed. After arrival the pigs were allowed to become accustomed to the chamber at 23 - 24 °C during a period of about 5 - 6 days and then a measurement of gaseous exchange was performed during a period of two days. After this period the temperature was lowered (usually 2 - 3 °C) and a new period of gaseous exchange determination followed after an adjustment period of 2 - 3 hours. The 2 - 3 hours were found to be adequate for the animals to produce the heat required under the new established temperature. The temperature was lowered again after the end of the two-day period and gaseous measurement started after 2 - 3 hours. This procedure was repeated until the temperature was about 8 °C, and after the period of declining temperatures the same trials were performed with temperatures changing in a reverse direction, up to 18 - 19 °C because in the meantime the animals had grown and had a lower limit of the thermoneutrality traject and therefore required a relatively lower temperature. The whole sequence was repeated until the animals weighed 80 - 100 kg. By following this experimental scheme a cyclical change in environmental temperature was achieved to avoid possible adaptation to cold conditions. In the literature these adaptations to cold conditions have been described. The cyclical change is more or less in accordance with the temperature fluctuations within 24 hours in practice. The animals were fed according to the normal feeding standards in usual use in The Netherlands (CENTRAALVEEVOEDERBUREAU). The singly housed animals were kept in metabolism cages of which two were placed together in one respiration chamber, whereas the group of 4 - 5 animals was housed in a pen built inside the chamber. Both housing systems had a wooden floor. To obtain information on the energy balances the digestibility and metabolisability of the feed was determined 3 or 4 times with the single housed animals at 18 - 20 °C during periods of one week each in the course of the <b>fattening</b> period. The <b>results</b> of these determinations were applied to the other periods with single housed pigs and also to the experiments with groups of animals. The pigs in the groups were of the same weight and received the same amount of the same feed. The determination of metabolisable energy with groups of pigs was, of course, hardly possible and because of this reason the results obtained with the single housed animals were used. Analysis of the errors made in the determination showed that this procedure of reducing the number of metabolisability determinations only slightly increases the inaccuracy of the results of balance trials provided that dry matter of the same feed was determined for every ration the animals received. Therefore during each part of the fattening period (20 - 50 kg and 50 - 90 kg) the feed was the same. Since in the literature many balance experiments with grown-up pigs (FINGERLING, NEHRING) and growing pigs housed singly (LUND, BREIREM, LUDVIGSEN and THORBEK) are recorded it was decided also to use these data in the computations on the relation between heat production, feed-intake and metabolic weight in the zone of the thermoneutrality with such equations as H = (1 -a) ME + ak 1 W p (1) H/Wp = (1 -a) ME/W p + ak 1 + bW (2) In these equations: H = heat production in kcal/animal. day; ME = metabolisable energy intake in kcal/animal. day; W = body weight in kg; a, b, p and k 1 are coefficients; k 1 represents the maintenance heat production and is calculated from ak 1 /a The computations with the equation (see Chapter 6) showed that the best value of p in these trials could be found between 0. 50 and 0. 70 for pigs above 50 kg and between 0. 80 and 0. 90 for animals below 50 kg. The differences in goodness of fit (R 2) with p = 3 / 4, however, were very small. The computations of the literature trials also suggested that p may be lower than 3 / 4 in mature animals and 3 / 4 or higher in growing animals of 20 - 100 kg. In general R 2 from equation (1) was between 0. 77 and 0. 99 in the results of these trials and between 0. 85 and 0. 99 in results of trials from the literature. It was concluded that p = 3 / 4 can be used without much hazard to express metabolic weight, especially when small weight ranges are concerned. Further the computations show a significant influence of age which in some of the literature trials had been taken as the variable instead of weight. No influence of weight (except in one case) in the present material for 20 - 50 kg or 50 - 90 kg was found. From those literature data which had a varying amount of ME/W 3 / 4 (NEHRING) 1 -a was found to be 0. 30 and this value was also used in the other trials from the literature in which a much smaller variation in feeding level was present. The by this method computed maintenance requirement (= maintenance heat production computed from ak 1 /a) was between 60 and 92 kcal, ME/W 3 / 4 for animals above 100 kg and between 100 - 110 kcal ME/W 3 / 4 for animals between 20 and 90 kg. From the results obtained with formula (2) without the term bW 1 -a was found also to be about 0. 30 in the trials with the highest variation in feeding level (ME/W 3 / 4). When again 1 -a was assumed to be 0. 30 the computed maintenance requirement was slightly higher than in the literature trials. This value however was the same in trials with single pigs and in those with groups of animals. Although there were consistent differences in these values between the various pairs of singly housed animals and also between the various groups of animals, the average for animals of 20 - 50 kg was about 122 kcal ME/W 3 / 4 and for animals of 50 - 90 kg about 116 kcal ME/W 3 / 4. Most of the presented experiments, however, were carried out at temperatures below the thermoneutral zone. Hypothetically a linear relationship between critical temperature of an animal and the weight and feedintake could be expected. Moreover the increase of heat production below the critical temperatures was assumed to be linear with the deviation from the critical temperature. To compute this relation the following regression equations were used: H/W p = (1 -a) ME/W p + bW + e(Tcr-T) + fΔt + ak 1 (3) H/W p = bW + e(Tcr - T) + fΔt + ak 1 + 160 (4) and Tcr = k 2 - cW - d ME/W p (for formula (3)) Tcr = k 2 - cW (for formula (4)) in which H, W and ME represent heat production per day in kcal, body weight in kg and metabolisable energy in kcal respectively; Tcr = critical temperature in °C, T = temperature in °C and t is temperature difference in °C between the actual temperature in the chamber and the temperature in the chamber during the preceding two days. k 1, k 2,b, d, a, c, e and f are coefficients. The value 160 refers to the heat production within the zone of thermoneutrality at the highest feeding level (about 250 - 270 kcal ME/W 3 / 4) found. In the experiments belonging to this kind of temperature trial the feeding level was kept as constant as possible. Therefore the results obtained with equation (3) and (4) were compared. Regression equations according to (3) and (4) were computed from data obtained with each pair and each group of animals, when using different values of k 2 and c in Tcr for formula (4). It was found that in animals below 50 kg the lowest residual standard deviations were obtained with k 2 = 21 and c = 0. 1. This indicated that the critical temperature at a constant feeding level i. e. a level giving a thermoneutral heat production of 160 kcal/W 3 / 4, could be computed with 21 - 0. 1 W for animals housed singly. With groups of pigs 20 - 0. 1 W fitted as well as 21 - 0. 1 W. Therefore the critical temperature in groups may be equal or only slightly less than in single animals. In pigs from 50 - 90 kg also the values 20 and 21 for k 2 were found to give the best results with groups and singly housed pigs and c could be considered to be somewhat higher than 0. 1 i. e. 0. 15. So probably the decrease in Tcr with decreasing body weight is somewhat faster in the animals above 50 kg. No significant influence of weight in equation (4) was found. Further the value of e in (3) and (4) refers to the effect of temperature below the critical level on heat production an effect which differed considerably between pigs housed singly or in groups. Between the different pairs of single pigs and groups significant different values of e were also obtained. As an average the single housed animals produced about 3. 5 - 5 kcal H/W 3 / 4 extra per °C below the critical whereas in groups this effect was 0. 8 - 1 kcal H/W 3 / 4. This means that groups of pigs, kept in this way, saved about 70 - 80 % of the extra heat required below the critical temperature compared with the single housed animals merely by huddling. From computations with equation (3) and (4) it was found that the direction of temperature change had in some cases a significant influence. Especially in pigs kept in groups the heat production increased with decreasing temperatures. Animals kept in groups produced below the critical temperature often more heat at the same temperature when they had been kept during the preceding two day period at a higher temperature than when they had been kept that preceding two- day period at a lower temperature. Perhaps this resulted from the fact that the animals were somewhat more restless due to looking for a better place in the huddled group. The energy gain of the single animals measured with animals weighing 20 - 50 kg and at different temperatures was distinguished as fat and protein. The low temperatures hardly affected the protein deposition of single animals of 20 - 50 kg but considerably reduced their fat deposition. The animals obviously mobilised body reserves to meet the required heat production while they still gained protein. In the discussion it has been pointed out that the amount of feed required to meet the extra heat necessary at low temperatures should be determined with animals kept in groups. Determination of critical temperature, however, can be made with singly-housed animals. Furthermore investigations will be necessary to study the influence of temperature on heat production of groups of pigs under different housing systems e. g. floors. The influence of temperature on the composition of body weight gain in groups of pigs has also to be investigated further...|$|R
