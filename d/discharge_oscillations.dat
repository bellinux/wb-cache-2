40|$|Early network {{oscillations}} and spindle bursts {{are typical}} patterns of spontaneous rhythmic activity in cortical networks of neonatal rodents in vivo and in vitro. The latter {{can also be}} triggered in vivo by stimulation of afferent inputs. The mechanisms underlying such oscillations undergo profound developmental changes in the first postnatal weeks. Their possible role in cortical development is postulated but not known in detail. We have studied spontaneous and evoked patterns of activity in organotypic cultures of slices from neonatal rat cortex grown on multielectrode arrays (MEAs) for extracellular single- and multi-unit recording. Episodes of spontaneous spike <b>discharge</b> <b>oscillations</b> at 7 - 25 Hz lasting for 0. 6 - 3 seconds appeared in about half of these cultures spontaneously and could be triggered by electrical stimulation of few distinct electrodes. These oscillations usually covered only restricted areas of the slices. Besides oscillations, single population bursts that spread in a wavelike manner over the whole slice also appeared spontaneously and were triggered by electrical stimulation. In most but not all cultures, population bursts preceded the oscillations. Both population bursts and spike <b>discharge</b> <b>oscillations</b> required intact glutamatergic synaptic transmission since they were suppressed by the AMPA/kainate glutamate receptor antagonist CNQX. The NMDA antagonist d-APV suppressed the oscillations but not the population bursts, suggesting an involvement of NMDA receptors in the oscillations. These findings show that spindle burst like cortical rhythms are reproduced in organotypic cultures of neonatal cortex. The culture model thus allows investigating the role of such rhythms in cortical circuit formation. Supported by SNF grant No. 3100 A 0 - 107641 / 1...|$|E

The focus of this doctoral research is on developing a grid-based direct kinetic (DK) simulation method that is an alternative to particle-based kinetic methods. The {{first part of this}} dissertation describes development of the grid-based direct kinetic method through verification and benchmarking. The test cases include a plasma-sheath with and without secondary electron emission from a plasma-immersed material as well as trapped particle bunching instability in nonlinear plasma waves. Using a hybrid kinetic-continuum method for the discharge plasma in a Hall effect thruster, the grid-based DK simulation and a standard particle-in-cell (PIC) method are compared. It was found that ionization events and hence ionization oscillations are captured without any statistical noise in the DK simulation in comparison to a particle simulation. In the second part, mode transition of the <b>discharge</b> <b>oscillations</b> in Hall effect thrusters, which are known to affect thruster performance, is investigated using the hybrid-DK method, in which the DK method is used for ions and a continuum method is used for electrons. The numerical simulations show good agreement with experimental data. In addition, a linear perturbation theory of ionization oscillations is derived. It is found that electron transport and temperature {{play an important role in}} such <b>discharge</b> <b>oscillations</b> whereas the common understanding in the community was that the heavy species are the main contributors. In addition, a two-dimensional simulation is developed to investigate the multidimensional ionization oscillation phenomena in the Hall effect thrusters. The effect of ion magnetization due to the magnetic field is included, showing a swirling effect of accelerated ions. Local ionization oscillations in the azimuthal direction are observed...|$|E

40|$|Results of {{controlling}} a <b>discharge</b> current <b>oscillation</b> in Hall thrusters at a frequency range of 10 – 100 kHz are presented. To understand the <b>discharge</b> current <b>oscillation</b> mechanism, the plasma {{behavior in the}} acceleration channel was observed with a high-speed camera using a 1 -kW class, anode layer type Hall thruster. The emission intensity oscillates equably in the acceleration channel at {{the same period of}} the discharge current oscillation; the number density of excited xenon ions oscillates at the same oscillation period and is proportional to the discharge current. These results indicate that the <b>discharge</b> current <b>oscillation</b> is caused by the ionization instability and the number density of plasma oscillates equably in the acceleration channel. Furthermore, the oscillation amplitude was sensitive to the applied magnetic flux density, indicating that this oscillation is affected by electron mobility. The proposed oscillation model based on the experimental results demonstrated that the momentum transfer corresponding to a plasma fluctuation is crucial to achieving stability. Thus, the oscillation amplitude for various acceleration channel configurations — parallel and convergent — was measured, because channel configuration could affect the momentum transfer. The oscillation was successfully suppressed by adopting the convergent configuration, as shown by this model...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Three {{aspects of}} glow {{discharges}} have been studied: glow <b>discharge</b> <b>oscillations,</b> sputtering, and coupling between cathode and anode regions {{the two most}} important regions in a glow discharge. Cathode and anode processes are tightly coupled by electron and ion coupling effects. Both electron and ion coupling effects were observed by studying excited Ar atoms in the cathode and anode regions and observing laser-induced space charge variations and the optogalvanic effect. Laser-induced space charge variations in the glow discharge were observed by the change in potential of an electrical probe. This signal, called the optopotential signal, provides useful information about the cathode and anode processes, and may become another useful spectroscopic detection method. Glow <b>discharge</b> <b>oscillations</b> are old phenomena but our mechanistic understanding of the processes involved continues to grow. A mechanism study is important especially now since a new type of sensitive GC detector is being developed based on this phenomenon. A SPAN model of glow discharge oscillation is proposed: source formation, propagation, accumulation, and neutralization of space charges. Electrode coupling couples the neutralization and source formation processes thus completing the feedback loop necessary for some of the observed oscillations to occur. Four modes of oscillations were found. Emission, space potential and current monitoring, and forced oscillations were used to monitor and identify the mechanisms. Studies of cathodic sputtering with gas flow rates up to 2. 13 L/min/jet were carried out in an Atomsource sputtering atomizer with Ar as the jet gas and Cu as the cathode sample. These flow rates are 20 -fold greater than those normally used and were found to increase net sputtering yield significantly. A fourfold increase in net sputtering yield was observed when the number of jets in use was decreased from six to one, with the gas flow rate and other conditions held constant.

The bottleneck’s location and mean discharge flows were reproducible from day to day. Further, it is shown that the bottleneck’s discharge flow was about 10 % lower than the prevailing flow observed prior to queue formation. Upon bottleneck activation, flow reductions occurring sequentially {{in time and space}} marked the passage of the backward-moving shock. Mean shock velocities ranged between 4. 8 to 6. 4 km/h (3 and 4 mph) as they traveled upstream from the bottleneck. During bottleneck <b>discharge,</b> <b>oscillations</b> arose in the queue and propagated upstream at nearly constant speeds of 17. 6 to 19. 2 km/h (11 to 12 mph). Flows measured at locations downstream of the bottleneck were not affected by these oscillations. These findings were corroborated using data from a freeway lane drop in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. The analysis tools used for this study were curves of cumulative vehicle count, time mean speed and occupancy versus time. These curves were constructed using data from neighboring freeway loop detectors and were transformed in order to provide the measurement resolution necessary to observe the transitions between freely-flowing and queued conditions and to identify important traffic features.

The {{purpose of this study}} is the spatial and temporal analysis of the mean seasonal discharges, meant to underline the need of implementing regulation projects for the Miletin stream. Furthermore, there are only a few specialized works on this hydrographic basin. The mean seasonal runoff presents significant seasonal and multiannual variations, caused by the high frequency of torrentiality, which characterizes the climate of the Miletin River area. Data from the rainfall stations of Nicolae Balcescu, Chiscareni, and Halceni, as well as from the hydrometric stations of Nicolae Balcescu, Sipote, and Halceni- downstream, respectively, were used. Unlike the stations with a natural runoff regime (Nicolae Balcescu, within the upper basin, Sipote within the middle basin, respectively), for Halceni-downstream (on the lower stream), the artificial runoff underlines a weak correlation with the rainfall regime. The data rows regard periods of 33 - 59 years, enough to conduct statistical analyses.

40|$|Understanding {{the effects}} of major hydrogeological {{controls}} on hyporheic exchange and bank storage is essential for river water management, groundwater abstraction, restoration and ecosystem sustainability. Analytical models cannot adequately represent complex settings with, for example, transient boundary conditions, varying geometry of surface water–groundwater interface, unsaturated and overland flow, etc. To understand the influence of parameters such as (1) sloping river banks, (2) varying hydraulic conductivity of the riverbed and (3) different river discharge wave scenarios on hyporheic exchange characteristics such as (a) bank storage, (b) return flows and (c) residence time, a 2 -D hydrogeological conceptual model and, subsequently, an adequate numerical model were developed. The numerical model was calibrated against observations in the aquifer adjacent to the hydropower-regulated Lule River, northern Sweden, which has predominantly diurnal discharge fluctuations during summer and long-lasting discharge peaks during autumn and winter. Modelling results revealed that bank storage increased with river wave amplitude, wave duration and smaller slope of the river bank, while maximum exchange flux decreased with wave duration. When a homogeneous clogging layer covered the entire river–aquifer interface, hydraulic conductivity positively affected bank storage. The presence of a clogging layer with hydraulic conductivity − 1 significantly reduced the exchange flows and virtually eliminated bank storage. The bank storage return/fill time ratio {{was positively related to}} wave amplitude and the hydraulic conductivity of the interface and negatively to wave duration and bank slope. <b>Discharge</b> <b>oscillations</b> with short duration and small amplitude decreased bank storage and, therefore, the hyporheic exchange, which has implications for solute fluxes, redox conditions and the potential of riverbeds as fish-spawning locations.

Major factors controlling Orinoco Delta water and sediment dynamics include the pronounced annual flood discharge; the uneven distribution of water and sediment discharge across the delta plain; discharge of large volumes of water with low sediment concentrations through the Rı́o Grande and Araguao distributaries; water and sediment dynamics associated with the Guayana littoral current along the northeastern South American coast; inflow of large volumes of Amazon sediment to the Orinoco coast...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of the {{discharge}} current in a cylindrical Hall thruster are presented to quantify plasma oscillations and instabilities without introducing an intrusive probe into the plasma. The time-varying component of {{the discharge}} current is measured using a current monitor that possesses a wide frequency bandwidth and the signal is Fourier transformed to yield the frequency spectra present, allowing for the identification of plasma oscillations. The data show that the <b>discharge</b> current <b>oscillations</b> become generally greater in amplitude and complexity as the voltage is increased, and are reduced in severity with increasing flow rate. The breathing mode ionization instability is identified, with frequency {{as a function of}} discharge voltage not increasing with discharge voltage as has been observed in some traditional Hall thruster geometries, but instead following a scaling similar to a large-amplitude, nonlinear oscillation mode recently predicted in for annular Hall thrusters. A transition from lower amplitude oscillations to large relative fluctuations in the oscillating discharge current is observed at low flow rates and is suppressed as the mass flow rate is increased. A second set of peaks in the frequency spectra are observed at the highest propellant flow rate tested. Possible mechanisms that might give rise to these peaks include ionization instabilities and interactions between various oscillatory modes...|$|R
