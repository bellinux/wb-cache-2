25|$|The {{aforementioned}} microeconomic concepts play a {{major part}} in macroeconomic models– for instance, in monetary theory, the quantity theory of money predicts that increases in the money supply increase inflation, and inflation {{is assumed to be}} influenced by rational expectations. In <b>development</b> <b>economics,</b> slower growth in developed nations has been sometimes predicted because of the declining marginal returns of investment and capital, and this has been observed in the Four Asian Tigers. Sometimes an economic hypothesis is only qualitative, not quantitative.|$|E

25|$|A 1992 World Bank report {{published}} in the Journal of <b>Development</b> <b>Economics</b> said that Inequality is negatively, and robustly, correlated with growth. This result is not highly dependent upon assumptions about either {{the form of the}} growth regression or the measure of inequality...Although statistically significant, the magnitude of the relationship between inequality and growth is relatively small. NYU economist William Baumol found that substantial inequality does not stimulate growth because poverty reduces labor force productivity. Economists Dierk Herzer and Sebastian Vollmer found that increased income inequality reduces economic growth, but growth itself increases income inequality.|$|E

More than ₨. 5 million were spent on the campaign and it undermined the credibility of conservatives, who also failed to resolve issues among between them.|$|E
