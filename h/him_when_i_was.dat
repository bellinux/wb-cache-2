5|$|He’s {{had a huge}} role in my career. There’s {{no doubt}} about that. I value his opinion. But as a person, Salman has had the biggest impact on my life. I became friends with <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> young. And his persona is very strong. If I were {{to look back and}} see his impact on my life, it’s been tremendous.|$|E
2500|$|A {{technocrat}} of high intellectual calibre, he was independent-minded and {{the best}} adviser Nyerere had. He had sharp political instincts but as a public servant never did anything for political expediency. His integrity was unimpeachable. I knew <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a news reporter." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{former coach}} Dan Reeves said about Gradishar, [...] "He {{was as good}} a linebacker as I have ever been around, and I have been around some great ones. He was a leader without {{question}} of our defense while I was with Denver. He was an exceptional football player. I {{had a great deal}} of respect for <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at Dallas before I ever went to Denver. After I arrived in Denver and saw what kind of a leader he was my respect for him grew. He never missed a game and was a dominant force on the field. The opposing team always had to take him into account when they devised their game plans." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{know nothing}} about Gartok," [...] replied the young man, a stern look taking the place of his usually kind expression; [...] "I don't trouble my head about <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> hunting." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{will write}} to <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{well over the}} Border,' said Geordie, 'and gin he kens that your father had no hand in it he will deem no ill-will. Nor could he harm you if he did.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Jankūnas {{made his}} pro debut with the Žalgiris in the 2003–04 season. When asked about playing with European {{basketball}} legend Arvydas Sabonis in his rookie season, Jankūnas responded: [...] "No doubt {{it was the}} most remarkable season. It was fantastic to play with Arvydas Sabonis. I was very young and it was very exciting. In the beginning, I was little bit afraid and uncomfortable, but later things got easy and I learned a lot from <b>him.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a kid, I used to watch him playing on TV and never dared to dream that I would be playing with Arvydas Sabonis. One day I woke up and Sabonis was my teammate. It was great. He had huge experience and gave a lot of advice to me. It was big honor to play with him and I hope I learned something from Sabonis." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But your lad's not stupid, is he? I saw <b>him,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> here last, busy making fishing-tackle; {{he seemed}} quite up to it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{introduced}} you to <b>him,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> as {{ignorant of}} the circumstances as you are," [...] the priest answered. [...] "The man is Mr. Bernard Winterfield." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I {{never was}} brought afore him,’ said Durdles, with {{anything}} but {{the look of a}} loyal subject of the mayoralty, ‘and it’ll be time enough for me to Honour <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> Until which, and when, and where, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{could he}} do to either of us? Am I not big enough to protect myself, {{and take care of}} you? I tell you what, Adrienne, why shouldn't I go and see <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> in London next week?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{will keep}} him easier {{to the right}} way, and it would <b>be</b> harder for <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> gone, and his father come home! And Mr Harford, {{he says he will}} find a good place for Judy. She is a good girl, a right good girl." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But your lad's not stupid, is he?" [...] said Mr. Riley. [...] "I saw <b>him,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> here last, busy making fishing-tackle; {{he seemed}} quite up to it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Luckily he didn't die, but kem to, {{and managed}} to crawl inter the brush, whar I found <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> lookin' for stock, and brought him to my house--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No;--as it happened, he did not. I {{played with}} <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> at Nuncombe; but, of course, one can't tell {{when a child}} will cry, and when it won't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I assure you,' cried Violet, eagerly, 'that is {{only because}} she does not like me. You cannot think how fond she <b>is</b> of <b>him.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{out of the way}} she goes to the nursery and pets him till Sarah is almost jealous of his fondness for her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Where you <b>are,</b> there <b>I</b> will <b>be,</b> husband. What, shall it be {{suffered}} {{that you}} face death, perhaps to find <b>him,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not at your side {{to die with}} you? If that is the fashion of white women, I leave it to them, beloved, and here with you I stay.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because, as I tell you, {{he is at}} home, in Detroit. How can <b>I</b> see <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> here in Dresden and he is in Detroit? You do ask foolish questions. He {{means to}} try and come over in the summer, if he can spare the time, and then, of course - ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought I told you. He is a Mr. Adams of Boston, and {{a distant}} {{connection}} of the Sewells. I met <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> visiting at Judge Sewell's in Boston." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did, Bess, and I hate {{myself for}} it. But you know I never dreamed {{he was your}} father. I thought he'd wronged you. I killed <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> madly jealous." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'O yes! As dearly as {{he loves}} me. Father loved me, first, for her sake. He carried me about with <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> quite a baby. We {{have never been}} asunder from that time.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I shall,' said Catherine. 'Linton <b>is</b> all <b>I</b> {{have to love}} in the world, {{and though}} you have done what you could to make him hateful to me, and me to him, you cannot make us hate each other. And I defy you to hurt <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> by, and <b>I</b> defy you to frighten me!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That may be," [...] {{said the}} other, [...] "and {{it is much}} to his credit, and to mine, too. <b>I</b> know <b>when</b> <b>I</b> want a doctor. I don't send for <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> in the last stages of {{anything}}. But we won't talk anything more about that. I want to know all about your husband. Do {{you think he is}} really out of health?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ohe, you rascal, you rake that {{up against}} me, do you? The Doctor will not forgive me because <b>I</b> tell <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> unwell that <b>I</b> had rather die {{of the disease}} than of the remedies. If I eat too fast it is {{the fault of the}} State, which does not allow me {{more than a few minutes}} for my meals. Which reminds me that it must be rather after my dinner hour, Constant?' ...|$|R
6000|$|NEWTE. One--a {{judge of}} the Supreme Court in Ohio. Same name, anyhow, O'Gorman. Thought I'd make him a cousin of yours. I've always remembered him. Met <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> over there in ninety- eight--damn him! ...|$|E
6000|$|Warming turned. [...] "And I {{have grown}} old too. I played cricket with <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> still only a boy. And he looks {{a young man}} still. Yellow perhaps. But that {{is a young man}} nevertheless." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I imagine I know enough. Gerald's in trouble; he or {{you must}} meet the bill Hallam will bring. You see, the fellow belongs to my club and I had a talk with <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in town." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, the boy at Liverpool! No, I {{only saw}} <b>him</b> once <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> staying with my cousin; but I will ask after {{him if you}} wish to hear.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Cumming {{said that}} his {{difficult}} childhood {{taught him how to}} act by [...] "needing to suppress my own emotions and feelings around <b>him</b> father <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a little boy".|$|R
6000|$|... "That feller {{has a job}} in {{a machine}} shop over in Barrington, <b>I</b> seen <b>him</b> there <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in the mills. And here he is tryin' to put us out--ain't that the limit?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{forgot to}} look for <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> last out,' {{returned}} Eugene with the calmest indifference; 'but I dare say he was there. Come! Be a British sportsman and enjoy {{the pleasures of the}} chase. It will do you good.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; I saw <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> up there, after--after--at {{the request}} of Suzette. I wished {{to talk with him}} about the scheme that Maxwell's heard of from a brother reporter," [...] and Matt now {{unfolded}} Pinney's plan to his father, and showed his letter.|$|E
60|$|Andy {{was hanging}} round, {{keeping an eye}} on things, as he always done, and I says to <b>him,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> passing, 'She's doing us proud, bucking up the old place, ain't she?' And he says, 'Get on with your work.' And I got on.|$|E
6000|$|Was that {{expression}} of suffering really caused by {{pain of the}} body? or was it attributable to anything that she had rashly said? She tried to recall what had passed between Frances and herself. The effort wearied her. Her thoughts turned self-reproachfully to Ovid. If he had been speaking to a friend whose secret sorrow was known to him, would he have mentioned {{the name of the}} woman whom they both loved? She looked at his portrait, and reviled herself as a selfish insensible wretch. [...] "Will Ovid improve me?" [...] she wondered. [...] "Shall <b>I</b> <b>be</b> a little worthier of <b>him,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> his wife?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, I think {{better of}} my Cousin Longshanks. <b>I</b> loved <b>him</b> well <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> his page at Hereford: he was {{tenderer}} {{to me than}} ever my brothers were; and I scarce think he would hang, draw, and quarter me now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor can <b>I.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> sleep <b>I</b> {{dream of}} <b>him.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> alone <b>I</b> cannot banish him from my thoughts. I cannot define {{what it is}} to love him. I want nothing from him,--nothing, nothing. But I move about through my little world {{thinking}} of him, and I shall do so to the end. I used to feel proud of my love, though it made me so wretched that I thought it would kill me. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not proud of it any longer. It is a foolish poor-spirited weakness,--as though my heart had been only half formed in the making. Do you be stronger, John. A man should be stronger than a woman." ...|$|R
