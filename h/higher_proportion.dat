5|$|Caversham's 2006 {{population}} was 5,058. The suburb {{has a slightly}} <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> of elderly residents than the Otago average, with 15.8% of residents aged 65 and over. It also has a considerably <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> of residents of Māori and Pacific island descent than the Otago average (10.3% and 4.4% respectively). Caversham also has nearly twice the average Otago proportion of one-parent families (26.5%). Ownership of and access to home telecommunications (such as the internet) and to private motor vehicles is considerably lower than the Otago average.|$|E

5|$|VKORC1 polymorphisms explain 30% of {{the dose}} {{variation}} between patients: particular mutations make VKORC1 {{less susceptible to}} suppression by warfarin. There are two main haplotypes that explain 25% of variation: low-dose haplotype group (A) and a high-dose haplotype group (B). VKORC1 polymorphisms explain why African Americans are on average relatively resistant to warfarin (<b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> of group B haplotypes), while Asian Americans are generally more sensitive (<b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> of group A haplotypes). Group A VKORC1 polymorphisms {{lead to a more}} rapid achievement of a therapeutic INR, but also a shorter time to reach an INR over 4, which is associated with bleeding.|$|E
50|$|ABS {{research}} {{indicated in}} 2003 that the 2001 census {{data showed that}} Indulkana had South Australia's <b>highest</b> <b>proportions</b> of Aboriginal residents (90%). Unlike other APY communities, Indulkana did not {{have one of the}} State's <b>highest</b> <b>proportion</b> of Australian-born residents, nor a <b>high</b> <b>proportion</b> of single parent families.|$|R
50|$|Haringey has a <b>high</b> <b>{{proportion}}</b> {{of young}} adults in the 20-39 age range and a low proportion of residents aged 45 and over. The borough has a <b>high</b> <b>proportion</b> of lone parent households.|$|R
50|$|For OFSTED {{inspections}} across England, {{the region}} has the <b>highest</b> <b>proportion</b> of schools (2.7%) with bad behaviour and the lowest proportion (16.3%) of schools with good behaviour. South West England has the best behaving schoolchildren. Inside the region, Hull has the <b>highest</b> <b>proportion</b> (16.7%) of schools with bad behaviour - the worst in England (Wandsworth and Bristol come joint second) - and York schools have the <b>highest</b> <b>proportion</b> (30%) of schools with outstanding behaviour.|$|R
5|$|A {{study by}} Polman, Pollmann, and Poehlman found that sharing {{initials}} with members {{in a group}} can increase the quality of group work. In a study ofundergraduatestudents they found that groups sharing initials performed better than groups that did not. Groups that had a <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> of shared initials exceeded groups with a lower proportion of shared initials.|$|E
5|$|Balaenids rely {{on their}} huge heads, {{as opposed to the}} rorquals' throat pleats, to feed effectively. This feeding {{behavior}} allows them to grow very big and bulky, without the necessity for a streamlined body. They have callosities, unlike other whales, {{with the exception of the}} bowhead whale. Rorquals have a <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> of muscle tissue and tend to be negatively buoyant, whereas right whales have a <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> of blubber and are positively buoyant. Gray whales are easily distinguished from other extant cetaceans by their sleet-gray color, dorsal ridges (knuckles on the back), and their gray-white scars left from parasites. As with the rorquals, their throat pleats increase the capacity of their throats, allowing them to filter larger volumes of water at once. Gray whales are bottom-feeders, meaning they sift through sand to get their food. They usually turn on their sides, scoop up sediment into their mouths and filter out benthic creatures like amphipods, which leave noticeable marks on their heads.|$|E

50|$|Its most {{prominent}} member was Sir Billy Snedden, Liberal Party leader from 1972 to 1975 and Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives from 1976 to 1983. At the 2011 Census, the division had the nation's <b>highest</b> <b>proportion</b> of residents born overseas (50.8%) {{and the third}} <b>highest</b> <b>proportion</b> born in a non-English speaking country (45.4%). It also has the sixth <b>highest</b> <b>proportion</b> speaking a language other than English at home (51.6%), the highest for any Victorian electorate.|$|R
5|$|The {{province}} of Punjab, in which Faisalabad {{is the second}} largest city, has prevalent sociocultural distinctions. Population sizes vary by district but some distinguishing factors include a young age structure, high age dependency ratio, {{a higher percentage of}} males, a <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> of married population, and heterogeneity in castes and languages.|$|E
5|$|According to the Kennel Club Purebred Dog Health Survey {{conducted}} in 2004, the two breeds had similar average lifespans: {{the median age}} at death was 12 years 3 months for Pembrokes, and 12 years 2 months for Cardigans. The {{main causes of death}} were similar in both breeds: the primary causes were canine cancer and old age. However, the Pembroke breed showed a <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> of deaths attributed to either kidney failure or a urethral obstruction.|$|E
5|$|Grasses {{generally}} comprise {{at least}} 80 {{percent of the}} hartebeest's diet, but they account for over 95 percent of their food in the wet season, October to May. Jasminum kerstingii {{is part of the}} hartebeest's diet {{at the start of the}} rainy season. Between seasons, they mainly feed on the culms of grasses. A study found that the hartebeest is able to digest a <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> of food than the topi and the wildebeest. In areas with scarce water, it can survive on melons, roots, and tubers.|$|E
5|$|Paris is the département {{with the}} <b>highest</b> <b>proportion</b> of highly educated people. In 2009, around 40 percent of Parisians held a licence-level diploma or <b>higher,</b> the <b>highest</b> <b>proportion</b> in France, while 13 percent have no diploma, the third lowest {{percentage}} in France.|$|R
50|$|The Metropolitan Borough of Oldham is {{the borough}} with the <b>highest</b> <b>proportion</b> of people under {{fifteen years of}} age.

5|$|With 83% of {{residents}} {{born in the}} United Kingdom, there is a relatively <b>high</b> <b>proportion</b> of foreign-born residents reported. There is also a <b>high</b> <b>proportion</b> of non-white people, as 73% {{of residents}} were recorded as white. The largest minority group was Asian, at 15% of the population.|$|R
5|$|In Ghana, FES is brewed in Kumasi by Guinness Ghana Breweries, {{which is}} 50.5 per cent owned by Diageo. GFE {{is mixed with}} a locally brewed sorghum lager, but it differs from the Nigerian version in that it {{contains}} no wheat and has a <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> of roast barley. In Ghana, the product {{is believed to have}} medicinal properties, strengthening the blood and improving circulation.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{is prone}} to skin disorders. About a quarter of Westies {{surveyed}} are affected by atopic dermatitis, a heritable chronic allergic skin condition. A <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> of males are affected compared to females. An uncommon but severe breed-specific skin condition, hyperplastic dermatosis, may affect West Highland White Terriers, both juveniles and adults dogs. Affected dogs can suffer from red hyperpigmentation, lichenification, and hair loss. In the initial stages, this condition can be misdiagnosed as allergies or less serious forms of dermatitis.|$|E
5|$|The {{first series}} {{received}} a mixed critical reception, with some reviewers concerned {{that it is}} too derivative and predictable, while others were more positive. The producers were happy to have started well, survived the ratings lull in the middle, and ended with an upward curve in the last two weeks. Audience breakdowns indicate that a <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> of younger viewers were tuning in to Survivors than many other shows.|$|E
50|$|At the 2011 Census, Calwell had the nation's {{most stable}} population, with only 25.6% of {{residents}} having {{moved in the}} last five years. The electorate had the nation's third <b>highest</b> <b>proportion</b> of Catholics (38.5%) and the third <b>highest</b> <b>proportion</b> of residents of Islamic faith (16.8%), the highest in Victoria.|$|R
50|$|Australian Bureau of Statistics {{research}} {{indicated in}} 2003 that the 2001 census {{data showed that}} Amata {{had one of the}} State's <b>highest</b> <b>proportions</b> of Aboriginal residents (89%) and, in all of South Australia, Amata at that time had one of the highest ratios of women to men in the State, 54.6% (the highest being Springton, with 57.2%). Amata, like most APY communities, has one of the State's <b>highest</b> <b>proportion</b> of Australian-born residents (97%), the <b>highest</b> <b>proportion</b> of single parent families (27.3%) but the lowest ratio of home computer use (5.5%).|$|R

5|$|The outer {{region of}} the Solar System {{is home to the}} giant planets and their large moons. The centaurs and many short-period comets also orbit in this region. Due to their greater {{distance}} from the Sun, the solid objects in the outer Solar System contain a <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> of volatiles, such as water, ammonia, and methane than those of the inner Solar System because the lower temperatures allow these compounds to remain solid.|$|E
5|$|There are {{types of}} planets {{that do not}} exist in the Solar System: super-Earths and mini-Neptunes, which could be rocky like Earth or a mixture of {{volatiles}} and gas like Neptune—a radius of 1.75 times that of Earth is a possible dividing line between the two types of planet. There are hot Jupiters that orbit very close to their star and may evaporate to become chthonian planets, which are the leftover cores. Another possible type of planet is carbon planets, which form in systems with a <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> of carbon than in the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|This {{nocturnal bird}} of prey hunts mainly rodents, usually by {{dropping}} from a perch to seize its prey, which it swallows whole; in more urban areas its diet includes a <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> of birds. Vision and hearing adaptations and silent flight aid its night hunting. The tawny owl is capable of catching smaller owls, but is itself vulnerable to the eagle owl or northern goshawk.|$|E

5|$|Three stages {{have been}} {{identified}} in the composition of the work. The first of these stages would have been based primarily on poems actually composed by Narihira, although the background details provided were not necessarily historical. The second saw poems added to the first layer that were not necessarily by Narihira, and had a <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> of fiction to fact. The third and final stage saw some later author adding the use of Narihira's name, and treating him as a legendary figure of the past.|$|E
5|$|Amanita ocreata {{is highly}} toxic, {{and has been}} {{responsible}} for mushroom poisonings in western North America, particularly in the spring. It contains highly toxic amatoxins, as well as phallotoxins, a feature shared with the closely related death cap (A. phalloides), half a cap of which can be enough to kill a human, and other species known as destroying angels. There is some evidence it may be the most toxic of all the North American phalloideae, as a <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> of people consuming it had organ damage and 40% perished. Dogs have also been known to consume this fungus in California with fatal results.|$|E
5|$|Another {{complication}} is {{release in}} multiple formats for which different ticket prices are charged. One notable {{example of this}} phenomenon is Avatar, which was also released in 3D and IMAX: almost two-thirds of tickets for that film were for 3D showings with an average price of $10, and about one-sixth were for IMAX showings with an average price over $14.50, compared to a 2010 average price of $7.61 for 2D films. Social and economic factors such as population change {{and the growth of}} international markets also impact on the number of people purchasing theater tickets, along with audience demographics where some films sell a much <b>higher</b> <b>proportion</b> of discounted children's tickets, or perform better in big cities where tickets cost more.|$|E
