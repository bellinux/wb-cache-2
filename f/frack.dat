2500|$|The US EPA has {{acknowledged}} that toxic, carcinogenic chemicals, i.e. benzene and ethylbenzene, {{have been used as}} gelling agents in water and chemical mixtures for high volume horizontal fracturing (HVHF). [...] Following the hydraulic fracture in HVHF, the water, chemicals, and <b>frack</b> fluid that return to the well's surface, called flowback or produced water, may contain radioactive materials, heavy metals, natural salts, and hydrocarbons which exist naturally in shale rock formations. [...] Fracking chemicals, radioactive materials, heavy metals, and salts that are removed from the HVHF well by well operators are so difficult to remove from the water they're mixed with, and would so heavily pollute the water cycle, that most of the flowback is either recycled into other fracking operations or injected into deep underground wells, eliminating the water that HVHF required from the hydrologic cycle.|$|E
2500|$|Contrary to this review, Majerus had {{stressed}} that the basic findings from that work were correct, and that differential bird predation of polluted environment [...] "is the primary influence {{of the evolution of}} melanism in the peppered moth". Coyne's statement that only two peppered moths had been found on tree trunks was incorrect, as the book gives the resting positions of 47 peppered moths Majerus had found in the wild between 1964 and 1996; twelve were on tree trunks (six exposed, six unexposed), twenty were at the trunk/branch joint, and fifteen resting on branches. Majerus found that the review did not reflect the factual content of the book or his own views, and cited an assessment by the entomologist Donald <b>Frack</b> that there was essentially no resemblance between the book and Coyne's review, which appeared to be a summary of the Sargent et al. paper rather than Majerus's book.|$|E

40|$|Hydraulic Fracturing or {{commonly}} known as <b>fracking</b> has caused a big boom in {{the oil and gas}} industry making it easier for us to extract oil and gas from the ground, but has serious side effects that as they cause harm to us and our environment. We should slow or stop <b>fracking</b> at once if we want a clean and healthy environment to live in. <b>Fracking</b> has become widely popular in the last decade and has brought us benefits on the oil and gas side and with little lack of information and support it has been difficult to put restrictions on <b>fracking.</b> <b>Fracking</b> is popular among developed nations and now occurs in more than 30 states. <b>Fracking</b> causes much concern from the public due to all the hazardous effects from <b>fracking,</b> such as water pollution and the release of greenhouse gas emissions, along with other consequences. The U. S. Geological Survey, in a March report on 2 ̆ 2 induced earthquakes, 2 ̆ 2 said as many as 7. 9 million people in parts of Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas now face the same earthquake risks as those in California. The report found that oil and gas drilling activity, particularly practices like hydraulic fracturing or <b>fracking,</b> is at issue. Though <b>fracking</b> has some benefits in the short-run, it will be hazardous to our environment and our society if we don’t have stronger regulations on <b>fracking.</b> The heavy use of <b>fracking</b> has caused more complaints from the public, which demands for stronger policies that would make <b>fracking</b> more efficient and less pollutant. The contamination/pollution of water from <b>fracking</b> has drawn great attention in the U. S. We have seen many complaints about chemicals in our water system from <b>fracking</b> due to leaks in the pipes and wells. Natural gas might seem like a better alternative that lowers the emissions of greenhouse gases, but when using and even extracting natural gas it requires a significant amount of work and energy, that still releases a relatively high amount of GHG’s. This is why we need to have better policies in place that will bring us better standards and make <b>fracking</b> more efficient without harming people or the environment around us. Since <b>fracking</b> is considered a better alternative because we can extract natural gas, which is cleaner than coal and produces less greenhouse gas emissions than coal, <b>fracking</b> seems to also get more leniencies towards aggressive policies, which makes it harder to watch and control <b>fracking.</b> <b>Fracking</b> in the U. S. has caused oil prices to go down along with a decrease in oil imports. While we have benefited from it economically the process of injecting high amounts of water and chemicals deep into the earth’s surface at extremely high pressures puts a negative effect on the environment. With lenient <b>fracking</b> policies companies will keep getting away with their operations with usually no supervision from an environmentalist or someone qualified to make sure the <b>fracking</b> company is following protocol. “Thousands of Texas oil and gas facilities are allowed to self-audit their emissions, and pollution complaints rarely result in punishment for the companies. Out of 284 oil and gas industry-related complaints in the Eagle Ford region between January 1, 2010 and November 19, 2013, only two resulted in fines” (Banerjee, 2013). There is major distrust between the <b>fracking</b> companies and the public regarding to the data the <b>fracking</b> companies record and also <b>fracking</b> companies refusing to release what chemicals they use during the <b>fracking</b> procedure. With <b>fracking</b> already being a concern this puts a red mark on <b>fracking</b> companies that do not wish to comply with the state or federal governments. We need to be concerned with all the <b>fracking</b> going on in the world and not let it pass by because it would be more costly to rebuild or cleanup after the damage is done. The United Nations Environment Program has concluded, “Hydrologic <b>fracking</b> may result in unavoidable environmental impacts even if (unconventional gas) is extracted properly, and more so if done inadequately. Even if risk can be reduced theoretically, in practice many accidents from leaky or malfunctioning equipment as well as from bad practices are regularly occurring”(Hardy, 210). <b>Fracking</b> does have some beneficial aspects, such as being able to extract more gas and oil giving us more energy to use and produce, but at the same time it is just another short-term method that helps us extract oil and gas. In terms of its effect on the environment, it is destructive to our health and our world. We need to focus on stronger policies that will limit and regulate <b>fracking,</b> while at the same time find better methodologies that will make <b>fracking</b> more efficient and less polluting. <b>Fracking</b> should just be temporary solution, until we find better ways through technology or renewable resources that will give us clean and efficient energy...|$|R
2500|$|In {{hydraulic}} fracturing, well operators force water {{mixed with}} a variety of chemicals through the wellbore casing into the rock. The high pressure water breaks up or [...] "fracks" [...] the rock, which releases gas from the rock formation. Sand and other particles are added to the water as a proppant to keep the fractures in the rock open, thus enabling the gas to flow into the casing and then to the surface. Chemicals are added to the fluid to perform such functions as reducing friction and inhibiting corrosion. After the [...] "frack," [...] oil or gas is extracted and nearly 30 percent to 70 percent of the <b>frack</b> fluid, i.e. the mixture of water, chemicals, sand, etc., flows back to the surface. Many gas-bearing formations also contain water, which will flow up the wellbore to the surface along with the gas, in both hydraulically fractured and non-hydraulically fractured wells. This produced water often has a high content of salt and other dissolved minerals that occur in the formation.|$|E

[...] This led <b>Frack</b> to exchange with intelligent design proponent Jonathan Wells, who conceded that Majerus listed six moths on exposed tree trunks (out of 47), but argued that this was [...] "an insignificant proportion". Wells wrote an essay on the subject, a shortened version of which appeared in The Scientist of 24 May 1999, claiming that [...] "In 25 years of fieldwork, C.A.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to gain an understanding of <b>fracking</b> technology and examine the effects <b>fracking</b> has had in other countries firstly, and furthermore what improvements, if any can be made in the process to reduce its environmental impact. The author will be carrying out a literature review in order to obtain a greater understanding on the need for <b>fracking,</b> the shale gas technology itself and will also look into the different aspects of the argument, for and against <b>fracking.</b> The most conventional <b>fracking</b> method used today is the Horizontal drilling and Stimulation process. This technique is the current method used nowadays with advancements making it hugely productive, mainly the ability to drill horizontally. <b>Fracking,</b> like any environmental hazard, has the ability to be a prosperous and valuable technology, one that creates plentiful jobs but the negligence from planners and operators partaking in the operations has created severe controversy. Two different case studies to portray the impacts of <b>fracking</b> in an everyday life situation are reviewed in this research dissertation. One case study focuses on the negative impacts of <b>fracking</b> and the other positive. The benefits of <b>fracking</b> are great but they do not diminish the potential hazardous impacts to our environment and human health. Implementation of these practices would surely reduce the possibility of such contamination occurring to the fresh water aquifer and would help improve the reputation of the <b>fracking</b> technology...|$|R

40|$|Shale gas {{exploration}} {{by means}} of Hydraulic Fracturing (<b>fracking)</b> {{has been on the}} South African (SA) energy agenda since 2010 as a potential alternative energy source to coalmining. Internationally, the desirability of <b>fracking</b> is debated due to increasing evidence of the environmental and health risks <b>fracking</b> poses. However, experts favouring <b>fracking</b> propose this technology as a greener alternative to conventional energy sources such as coal. Limited scientific evidence is available internationally related to knowledge and risk perceptions of <b>fracking</b> and evidence is limited to studies conducted in the United States (US). South African risk perception studies relates to mining, farming, travelling in SA as a foreigner and sexual behaviour. The president of SA called <b>fracking</b> a 'Game-Changer' using industry jargon in the 2014 presidential address. However, SA has failed to produce exploration regulations to date despite oil and gas companies pushing their agendas. Public participation in the process thus far has been limited. This cross sectional study explored the knowledge, health risk perceptions and information sources related to <b>fracking</b> amongst 102 Central Karoo residents through a household survey. Beaufort West municipality was selected as the study site as {{this is one of the}} closestareas to Cape Town demarcated for <b>fracking</b> exploration. This study found that 40 % of Central Karoo residents do not know what <b>fracking</b> is or the potential risks and benefits thereof. Media is the main information source of 59 % of participants. Only half of participants trust their information sources. Those with more trust in their information sources perceived <b>fracking</b> as posing a greater risk. In contrast those believing <b>fracking</b> to pose a low risk were more likely to trust the government and oil and gas companies. More than half of participants (53 %) believe that <b>fracking</b> poses an extreme health risk and 78 % thought <b>fracking</b> will harm their health. Most commonly listed causes why <b>fracking</b> will make Karoo residents sick includes water pollution (47. 4 %) and air pollution (19. 6 %). Higher education was found to have an inverse relationship with trust in the national government A limitation of this study was that farms could not be randomly selected, affecting the representativeness of the sample. There is a major lack of knowledge pertaining to <b>fracking</b> among those living in the Central Karoo which has important implications for managing the process of public participation in the approval of shale gas exploration...|$|R
