5000|$|<b>Halophiles</b> are {{organisms that}} thrive in high salt concentrations. They are {{a type of}} extremophile organisms. The name comes from the Greek word for [...] "salt-loving". While most <b>halophiles</b> are {{classified}} into the Archaea domain, there are also bacterial <b>halophiles</b> and some eukaryota, such as the alga Dunaliella salina or fungus Wallemia ichthyophaga. Some well-known species give off a red color from carotenoid compounds, notably bacteriorhodopsin. <b>Halophiles</b> can be found anywhere with a concentration of salt five {{times greater than the}} salt concentration of the ocean, such as the Great Salt Lake in Utah, Owens Lake in California, the Dead Sea, and in evaporation ponds.|$|R

The areas of ecological interest are found in the remaining 3% percent of the terrain. The region is characterized by tilled land and pastures, small pine woods and holm oak woods, with interspersed wasteland areas covered in <b>halophile</b> bushes. There are also many small ephemeral ponds; a characteristic of Spanish steppes, which are only water-filled during the winter. From a conservation standpoint, such ponds, like nearby segments of the Trabancos River's banks, are in a precarious ecological state.

Many plants are rainfall sensitive, with most trees and shrubs growing leaves and flowers just before or during the rainy season, then drop their leaves afterwards. However, there are plants in flower at one time or another throughout the year. Coastal plants receive less water stress due to lower evaporation rates, and substantial moisture from dew, especially in the cooler months.|$|E

Tests of growth potential in natural saltern brines demonstrated that none of the halobacteria grew well in brines which harbor the densest populations of these bacteria in solar salterns. All grew best in brines which were unsaturated with NaCl.

Many halophilic bacteria and archaea are easy to maintain, and their high cellular osmotic pressure has been exploited in recombinant protein production. The cellular environments of <b>halophiles</b> can be fine-tuned to accommodate folding of protein of interest by adjusting the concentration of osmolytes in the culture medium.

40|$|Background: Halophilic prokaryotes are {{adapted to}} thrive in extreme {{conditions}} of salinity. Identification and analysis of distinct macromolecular characteristics of <b>halophiles</b> {{provide insight into the}} factors responsible for their adaptation to high-salt environments. The current report presents an extensive and systematic comparative analysis of genome and proteome composition of halophilic and non-halophilic microorganisms, with a view to identify such macromolecular signatures of haloadaptation. Results: Comparative analysis of the genomes and proteomes of <b>halophiles</b> and non-halophiles reveals some common trends in <b>halophiles</b> that transcend the boundary of phylogenetic relationship and the genomic GC-content of the species. At the protein level, halophilic species are characterized by low hydrophobicity, over-representation of acidic residues, especially Asp, underrepresentation of Cys, lower propensities for helix formation and higher propensities for coil structure. At the DNA level, the dinucleotide abundance profiles of halophilic genomes bear some common characteristics, which are quite distinct from those of non-halophiles, and hence may be regarded as specific genomic signatures for salt-adaptation. The synonymous codon usage in <b>halophiles</b> also exhibits similar patterns regardless of their long-term evolutionary history. Conclusion: The generality of molecular signatures for environmental adaptation of extreme saltloving organisms, demonstrated in the present study, advocates the convergent evolution of halophilic species towards specific genome and amino acid composition, irrespective of their varying GC-bias and widely disparate taxonomic positions. The adapted features of <b>halophiles</b> seem to be related to physical principles governing DNA and protein stability, in response to the extreme environmental conditions under which they thrive...|$|R
