25|$|The gene NRG1 {{codes for}} neuregulin 1, a growth factor which {{is crucial to}} the {{development}} of the nervous system, and to neurotransmission and formation of synapses in adults. NRG1 and the gene for the receptor to which neuregulin 1 binds, ERBB4, have been tested as possible animal models of schizophrenia. While mice which have two copies of (are homozygous for) a knocked out version of NRG1 do not survive, viable animal models have been developed using heterozygous or partial knockout. One such mouse model is the heterozygous removal of the <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domain</b> on neuregulin 1, these models are called Nrg1(ΔEGF)+/− mice. Nrg1(ΔEGF)+/− mice have been shown to have social interaction problems, reduced prepulse of inhibition and larger spontaneous locomotion. Other neuregulin 1 models include the heterozygous removal of the transmembrane domain (Nrg1(ΔTM)+/− mice) and the immunoglobulin domain (Nrg1(ΔIg)+/− mice). Nrg1(ΔTM)+/− mice display hyperactivity in various conditions, an effect which is reduced by the atypical antipsychotic clozapine.|$|E
500|$|ApoER2 is {{a protein}} {{made up of}} 870 amino acids. [...] It is {{separated}} into a ligand binding domain of eight ligand binding regions, an <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domain</b> containing three cysteine-rich repeats, an O-linked glycosylation domain of 89 amino acids, a transmembrane domain of 24 amino acids, and a cytoplasmic domain of 115 amino acids, including an NPXY motif.|$|E
2500|$|Diphtheria toxin is a single, 60-kDa-molecular weight protein {{composed}} of two peptide chains, fragment A and fragment B, held together by a disulfide bond. Fragment B is a recognition subunit that gains the toxin entry into the host cell by binding to the <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domain</b> of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor [...] on the cell surface. This signals the cell to internalize the toxin within an endosome via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Inside the endosome, the toxin is split by a trypsin-like protease into its individual A and B fragments. The acidity of the endosome causes fragment B to create pores in the endosome membrane, thereby catalysing the release of fragment A into the cell's cytoplasm.|$|E
50|$|CD97 {{is widely}} {{expressed}} on, among others, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, immune cells, epithelial cells, muscle cells {{as well as}} their malignant counterparts. In the case of CD97 the N-terminal domains consist of alternatively spliced epidermal growth factor (<b>EGF)-like</b> <b>domains.</b> Alternative splicing has been observed for this gene and three variants have been found. The N-terminal fragment of CD97 contains 3-5 <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domains</b> in human and 3-4 <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domains</b> in mice.|$|R
50|$|EMR2 is {{expressed}} by monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells and {{all types of}} granulocytes. In the case of EMR2 the N-terminal domains consist of alternatively spliced epidermal growth factor-like (<b>EGF-like)</b> <b>domains.</b> EMR2 {{is closely related to}} CD97 with 97% amino-acid identity in the <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domains.</b> The N-terminal fragment (NTF) of EMR2 presents 2-5 <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domains</b> in human. Mice lack the Emr2 gene. This gene is closely linked to the gene encoding EGF-like molecule containing mucin-like hormone receptor 3 EMR3 on chromosome 19.|$|R
50|$|Phan et al. {{could show}} that the {{artificial}} insertion of an N-glycosylation site into the <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domains</b> in P- and L-selectins increased the affinities of selectins to their ligands and led to slower rolling. Therefore, <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domains</b> seem to {{play a crucial role}} in leukocyte movements towards inflammatory stimuli.|$|R
50|$|Selectins, a {{group of}} {{proteins}} {{that are involved in}} leukocyte rolling towards a source of inflammation, contain an <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domain</b> along with a lectin domain and short consensus repeats (SCRs). The functions of the <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domain</b> vary between different selectin types. Kansas and co-workers were able to show that the <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domain</b> is not required for maximal cellular adhesion in L-selectin (expressed on lymphocytes). However, it is involved in both ligand recognition and adhesion in P-selectin (expressed on platelets) and may also be involved in protein-protein interactions. It has been suggested that the interactions between lectin domains and carbohydrate ligands might be calcium-dependent.|$|E
50|$|Many alliinases {{contain a}} novel N-terminal {{epidermal}} growth factor-like domain (<b>EGF-like</b> <b>domain).</b>|$|E
50|$|Cysteine-rich with <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domain</b> protein 1 is {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the CRELD1 gene.|$|E
50|$|EMR1 {{expression}} in human {{is restricted to}} eosinophils and is a specific marker for these cells. The murine homolog of EMR1, F4/80, is a well-known and widely used marker of murine macrophage populations. The N-terminal fragment (NTF) of EMR1 contains 4-6 Epidermal Growth Factor-like (<b>EGF-like)</b> <b>domains</b> in human and 4-7 <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domains</b> in the mouse.|$|R
50|$|In conclusion, {{although}} distinct <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domains</b> are grouped, subtypes can {{be clearly}} separated by their sequence, conformation and, most importantly, their function.|$|R
50|$|The {{sequence}} of fibrillin-1 includes 47 six-cysteine <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domains,</b> 7 eight-cysteine domains homologous with latent TGF-beta binding protein, and a proline-rich region.|$|R
50|$|In conclusion, the <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domain</b> {{appears to}} {{play a vital role}} in immune {{responses}} as well as in eliminating dead cells in the organism.|$|E
50|$|The Egfl7 protein (29 kDa) is {{composed}} of several putative domains: a putative cleavable signal peptide at the N-terminal end, an EMI domain, found on extracellular matrix proteins, two EGF-like domains and a leucine and valine rich C-terminal region. The first <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domain</b> has a region similar to the DSL (Delta/Serrate/Lag-2) domain found in ligands of the Notch receptors family, the second <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domain</b> is predicted to bind Ca2+. The Eglf7 protein is secreted and associates with the blood vessel extracellular matrix.|$|E
50|$|The <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domain</b> is an {{evolutionary}} conserved protein domain, which derives {{its name from}} the epidermal growth factor where it was first described. It comprises about 30 to 40 amino-acid residues and has been found in a large number of mostly animal proteins. Most occurrences of the <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domain</b> are found in the extracellular domain of membrane-bound proteins or in proteins known to be secreted. An exception to this is the prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase. The <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domain</b> includes 6 cysteine residues which in the epidermal growth factor have been shown to form 3 disulfide bonds. The structures of 4-disulfide EGF-domains have been solved from the laminin and integrin proteins. The main structure of EGF-like domains is a two-stranded β-sheet followed by a loop to a short C-terminal, two-stranded β-sheet. These two β-sheets are usually denoted as the major (N-terminal) and minor (C-terminal) sheets. EGF-like domains frequently occur in numerous tandem copies in proteins: these repeats typically fold together to form a single, linear solenoid domain block as a functional unit.|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{similarities}} of <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domains,</b> distinct domain subtypes have been identified. The two main proposed types of <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domains</b> are the human <b>EGF-like</b> (hEGF) <b>domain</b> and the complement C1r-like (cEGF) domain, which was first {{identified in the}} human complement protease C1r. C1r is a highly specific serine protease initiating the classical pathway of complement activation during immune response. Both the hEGF- and cEGF-like domains contain three disulfides and derive from a common ancestor that carried four disulfides of which one was lost during evolution. Furthermore, cEGF-like domains can be divided in two subtypes (1 and 2) whereas all hEGF-like domains belong to one subtype.|$|R
50|$|Calcium-binding <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domains</b> are {{typically}} composed of 45 amino acids, arranged as two antiparallel beta sheets. Several cysteine residues within this sequence form disulfide bridges.|$|R
50|$|Tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like and <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domains</b> 1 {{also known}} as TIE1 is an angiopoietin {{receptor}} which in humans is encoded by the TIE1 gene.|$|R
50|$|The <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domain</b> is {{also part}} of laminins, an {{important}} group of extracellular proteins. The EGF-like domains are usually masked in intact membranes, but become exposed when the membrane is destroyed, e.g. during inflammation, thereby stimulating membrane growth and restoring damaged membrane parts.|$|E
50|$|Calcium EGF-like domain: Calcium-binding <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domain,</b> {{present in}} {{a large number of}} membrane-bound and {{extracellular}} (mostly animal) proteins. Many of these proteins require calcium for their biological function and calcium-binding sites {{have been found to be}} located at the N-terminus of particular EGF-like domains.|$|E
50|$|Like {{the related}} CD97 protein, the fourth <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domain</b> of EMR2 binds chondroitin sulfate B to mediate cell attachment. However, unlike CD97 EMR2 does not {{interact}} with the complement regulatory protein, decay accelerating factor CD55, and indicating that these very closely related proteins likely have nonredundant functions.|$|E
50|$|As in non-calcium binding <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domains,</b> {{there are}} six conserved cysteines and the {{structure}} of both types is very similar as calcium-binding induces only strictly local structural changes.|$|R
50|$|It {{has four}} domains: a gla-rich region, two <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domains</b> and a trypsin-like domain. It lacks the serine residue {{that would make}} it catalytically active as a serine protease.|$|R
50|$|This protein {{belongs to}} the LDLR family and {{is made up of}} a number of {{functionally}} distinct <b>domains,</b> including 3 <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domains,</b> 7 LDL-R class A domains, and 6 LDL-R class B repeats.|$|R
50|$|The protein {{has been}} shown to undergo glycosolation post-translationally at amino acids 144, 407, and 431. There are also three {{disulfide}} bonds between amino acid 498 and 508, 502 and 521, and 523 and 532. These disulfide bonds are all characteristic of proteins with an <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domain.</b>|$|E
50|$|Moreover, the <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domain</b> repeats of the stabilin-2 domain {{have been}} shown to {{specifically}} recognize and bind apoptotic cells, probably by recognizing phosphatidylserine, an apoptotic cell marker (“eat me-signal”). Park et al. further demonstrated that the domains are able to competitively impair recognition of apoptotic cells by macrophages.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, protein S has a peptide {{between the}} Gla domain and the <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domain,</b> that is cleaved by thrombin. The Gla and EGF-like domains stay {{connected}} after the cleavage by a disulfide bond. However, protein S loses its {{function as an}} APC cofactor following either this cleavage or binding C4BP.|$|E
50|$|In humans, thrombomodulin is encoded by the THBD gene. The protein has a {{molecular}} mass of 74kDa, {{and consists of}} a single chain with six tandemly repeated <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domains,</b> a Serine/Threonine-rich spacer and a transmembrane domain.|$|R
50|$|AMACO is {{a member}} of the von Willebrand factor A-like (VWA) domain {{containing}} protein superfamily and consists of three VWA-like <b>domains,</b> two <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domains,</b> a cysteine-rich domain and a unique C-terminal domain.AMACO is an extracellular matrix protein and mostly deposited adjacent to basement membranes.|$|R
40|$|The 42 -kDa {{processed}} {{fragment of}} Plasmodium falciparum {{merozoite surface protein}} 1 (MSP- 142) is a prime candidate for a blood-stage malaria vaccine. Merozoite surface protein 8 contains two C-terminal epidermal growth factor (EGF) -like domains that may function similarly to those of MSP- 142. Immunization with either MSP- 1 or MSP- 8 induces protection that is mediated primarily by antibodies against conformation-dependent epitopes. In a series of comparative immunogenicity and efficacy studies using the Plasmodium yoelii rodent model, we tested the ability of recombinant P. yoelii MSP- 8 (rPyMSP- 8) to complement rPyMSP- 1 -based vaccines. Unlike MSP- 1, PyMSP- 8 -dependent protection required immunization with the full-length protein and was not induced with recombinant antigens that contained only the C-terminal <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domains.</b> Unlike PyMSP- 8, the immunogenicity of the PyMSP- 1 <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domains</b> was low when present {{as part of the}} rPyMSP- 142 antigen. Immunization with a mixture of rPyMSP- 142 and rPyMSP- 8 further inhibited the antibody response to protective epitopes of rPyMSP- 142 and did not improve vaccine efficacy. To improve PyMSP- 1 immunogenicity, we produced a chimeric antigen containing the <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domains</b> of PyMSP- 1 fused to the N terminus of PyMSP- 8. Immunization with the chimeric rPyMSP- 1 / 8 antigen induced high and comparable antibody responses against the <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domains</b> of both PyMSP- 1 and PyMSP- 8. This enhanced MSP- 1 -specific antibody response and the concurrent targeting of MSP- 1 and MSP- 8 resulted in improved, nearly complete protection against lethal P. yoelii 17 XL malaria. Unexpectedly, immunization with rPyMSP- 1 / 8 failed to protect against challenge infection with reticulocyte-restricted P. yoelii 17 X parasites. Overall, these data establish an effective strategy to improve the efficacy of P. falciparum MSP-based vaccines...|$|R
50|$|In human tissue {{plasminogen}} activator chain A the FN1 domain together with the following epidermal growth factor (<b>EGF)-like</b> <b>domain</b> are involved in fibrin-binding. It {{has been suggested that}} these two modules form a single structural and functional unit. The two domains keep their specific tertiary structure, but interact intimately to bury a hydrophobic core; the inter-module linker makes up the third strand of the EGF-module's major beta-sheet.|$|E
5000|$|The EGF module-containing Mucin-like hormone Receptors (EMRs) {{are closely}} related {{subgroup}} of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These receptors have a unique hybrid structure in which an extracellular epidermal growth factor (<b>EGF)-like</b> <b>domain</b> is fused to a GPCR domain through a mucin-like stalk. [...] There are four variants of EMR labeled 1-4, each encoded by a separate gene. These receptors are predominantly expressed in cells {{of the immune system}} and bind ligands such as CD55.|$|E
50|$|ApoER2 is {{a protein}} {{made up of}} 870 amino acids. It is {{separated}} into a ligand binding domain of eight ligand binding regions, an <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domain</b> containing three cysteine-rich repeats, an O-linked glycosylation domain of 89 amino acids, a transmembrane domain of 24 amino acids, and a cytoplasmic domain of 115 amino acids, including an NPXY motif. Each letter in the NPXY motif represents a certain amino acid where N is arginine, P is proline, X is any amino acid, and Y is tyrosine.|$|E
50|$|Interestingly, {{immature}} human dendritic cells {{appear to}} require {{interactions with the}} <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domains</b> of selectins during their maturation process. Blocking of this interaction with monoclonal anti-EGF-like domain antibodies prevents dendritic cell maturation. The immature cells fail to activate T-cells and produce less interleukin 12 than wild-type dendritic cells.|$|R
50|$|Inactive protein C {{comprises}} 419 {{amino acids}} in multiple domains: one Gla domain (residues 43-88); a helical aromatic segment (89-96); two {{epidermal growth factor}} (<b>EGF)-like</b> <b>domains</b> (97-132 and 136-176); an activation peptide (200-211); and a trypsin-like serine protease domain (212-450). The light chain contains the Gla- and <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domains</b> and the aromatic segment. The heavy chain contains the protease domain and the activation petide. It is in this form that 85-90% of protein C circulates in the plasma as a zymogen, waiting to be activated. The remaining protein C zymogen comprises slightly modified forms of the protein. Activation of the enzyme occurs when a thrombin molecule cleaves away the activation peptide from the N-terminus of the heavy chain. The active site contains a catalytic triad typical of serine proteases (His253, Asp299 and Ser402).|$|R
50|$|The aggrecan family {{includes}} {{other important}} members such as versican, also named PG-M, neurocan, brevican and the cell surface HA receptor CD44. They are modular proteoglycans containing combinations of structural motifs, such as <b>EGF-like</b> <b>domains,</b> carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD), complement binding protein (CBP)-like domains, immunoglobulin folds and proteoglycan tandem repeats.|$|R
