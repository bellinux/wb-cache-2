5|$|The {{bill was}} also an attempt to place the {{relationship}} between the House of Commons and House of Lords on a new footing. As well as the direct issue of money Bills, it set new conventions about how the power the Lords continued to hold would be used. It <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>change</b> the composition of the Lords, however.|$|E
5|$|The {{corpus of}} {{published}} Epistles <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>change</b> after Bellman's death.

5|$|The demands made on Beatrice {{during her}} mother's reign were high. Despite {{suffering}} from rheumatism, Beatrice {{was forced to}} endure her mother's love of cold weather. Beatrice's piano playing suffered as her rheumatism got gradually worse, eliminating an enjoyment in which she excelled; however, this <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>change</b> her willingness to cater to her mother's needs. Her effort did not go unnoticed by the British public.|$|E
5|$|All studies {{revealed}} minor {{improvements in}} household nutrient availability, with the 1985 study revealing an improvement of vitamin and mineral consumption over non-participating {{families and the}} 1993 study partially confirming these results. The most extensive study on nutrient availability was published in 1996, which concluded that nutrition <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>change</b> significantly after {{the implementation of the}} NAP program for all beneficiaries, however most improvements were noted for very low-income beneficiaries versus their non-participating equivalents.|$|E
5|$|Batista {{was left}} on his own {{as a result of}} The Legacy attacking Shane McMahon, but {{continued}} to challenge Orton for the WWE Championship. Orton and Batista had a match at Judgment Day, but it ended with Orton intentionally slapping the referee to cause a disqualification, which meant that the championship <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>change</b> hands. In their rematch, however, which was held inside a steel cage at the Extreme Rules pay-per-view, Batista won the championship.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, the French dangerously underestimated Austrian {{tenacity}} {{and military}} skill. The white coats, as the French called the Austrians, were far better soldiers than the French assumed, and despite such demonstrations as that at Ostrach, Stockach and Winterthur, the French {{continued to hold}} this prejudice. This <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>change</b> until 1809 when the Battle of Aspern-Essling and the Battle of Wagram {{a few weeks later}} caused Napoleon to revise his opinion of the Austrian military.|$|E
5|$|Groves soon {{decided to}} {{establish}} his project headquarters {{on the fifth floor}} of the New War Department Building (now known as the Harry S Truman Building) in Washington, D.C., where Marshall had maintained a liaison office. In August 1943, the MED headquarters (and Nichols, {{who was in charge of}} the production facilities at Hanford and Oak Ridge) moved to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, but the name of the district <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>change.</b>|$|E
5|$|Her {{green eyes}} {{were meant to}} symbolize nature and also served as another {{contrast}} to Tifa's brown eyes. Nomura <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>change</b> much of Aerith's design for Advent Children, but her design was updated in Kingdom Hearts with the removal of her bolero jacket, which made her attire appear more as Amano had originally drawn her. Other changes included the addition of bracelets and a belt. Nomura modified her dress in Before Crisis, adding white and green colors, and this version was also {{used as the basis}} for her design in Kingdom Hearts II.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the figures}} used in the {{calculation}} of the bomb's trajectory were based on fixed values, and were entered before the mission started. In particular, the terminal velocity {{was based on the}} type of bomb being dropped and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>change</b> during the mission. This was used to calculate how steep the path of the bomb would be when dropped from high altitudes; at lower altitudes and airspeeds, the bomb did not reach terminal velocity and followed a more parabolic path. Other measures were only entered as the aircraft approached the target.|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} situation in the area <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>change</b> until 1995. That year, Croatia militarily defeated the Croatian Serbs in offensives codenamed Flash and Storm, in May and August respectively. That left eastern Slavonia as the last remaining Croatian Serb-held area. Gradual restoration of the area to Croatian rule was agreed upon in November through the Erdut Agreement, and the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES) peacekeeping mission was deployed to implement the agreement.|$|E
5|$|United States President Woodrow Wilson {{pronounced}} white participants the instigators of {{the prolonged}} riots in Chicago and Washington, D.C.. As a result, {{he attempted to}} promote greater racial harmony through the promotion of voluntary organizations and through the enactment of legislative improvements by the United States Congress. He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>change</b> the segregation of federal departments which he had imposed early during his first administration, however. The Chicago Race Riot of 1919 shocked the nation and raised awareness {{of the problems that}} African Americans faced every day in the 20th century United States.|$|E

5000|$|In {{mathematics}} and statistics, a stationary process ( [...] a strict(ly) stationary process or strong(ly) stationary process) is a stochastic process whose joint probability distribution <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>change</b> when shifted in time.

5|$|As in {{most other}} parts of the world, the decades {{following}} the World War II were relatively free from football violence and the supporter culture <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>change</b> much. Swedish football culture started to change in the late 1960s, becoming heavily inspired and influenced by the English supporter culture. This flourished in the 1970s and 1980s, giving birth {{to some of the most}} well-known Swedish supporters clubs, AIK's Black Army, Djurgårdens IF's Blue Saints (later Järnkaminerna), and IFK Göteborg's supporters club, Änglarna (the Angels). The first attempt to found an IFK supporters club was made in 1969, but interest diminished when IFK Göteborg were relegated from the highest league the following year. The supporters club was not re-founded until 1973, which is considered the year of foundation of Änglarna.|$|E
5|$|By 1860, Smith {{was doing}} very well; {{he had moved}} to Leonard Street within the Fifth Ward and had a mansion built by white workmen. His total real {{property}} was worth $25,000. His household included a live-in servant, Catherine Grelis from Ireland. Listed as a separate household at his address were Sara D. Williams, 57, and Mary Hertell (should be Hewlitt, as above), 50. (These were likely the same Sara and Mary as in the 1850 census, although their ages <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>change.)</b> No one on this census page had a racial designation. By the conventions of the time, this means that they were classified as white by the census enumerator; totals of white persons only are given {{at the bottom of}} the page.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Audouin Dollfus of the Observatoire de Paris {{reported}} anomalous {{features on}} the floor of Langrenus crater using a one-meter (3.2-foot) telescope. While observations on the night of December 29, 1992, were normal, unusually high albedo and polarization features were recorded the following night that <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>change</b> in appearance over the six minutes of data collection. Observations three days later showed a similar, but smaller, anomaly in the same vicinity. While the viewing conditions for this region were close to specular, it was argued that the amplitude of the observations were not consistent with a specular reflection of sunlight. The favored hypothesis was that this was the consequence of light scattering from clouds of airborne particles resulting from a release of gas. The fractured floor of this crater was cited as a possible source of the gas.|$|E
50|$|A common {{approach}} {{to finding the}} rank of a matrix is to reduce it to a simpler form, generally row echelon form, by elementary row operations. Row operations <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>change</b> the row space (hence <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>change</b> the row rank), and, being invertible, map the column space to an isomorphic space (hence <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>change</b> the column rank). Once in row echelon form, the rank is clearly the same for both row rank and column rank, and equals the number of pivots (or basic columns) and also the number of non-zero rows.|$|R
