40|$|Polymetallic sea nodules are the {{potential}} resources of copper, cobalt, manganese, and nickel. The exploration and <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> manganese <b>nodules</b> {{are necessary to}} meet the future demands of Mn in the world. This work describes the valuable extraction of Mn through an innovative approach of using sucrose as a reductant. The metal extraction from the nodule leaching was studied in ambient temperature (27 °C) and at an elevated temperature 90 °C with and without agitation. In both cases, 99. 9 % of Mn was extracted while the extraction time appears to be significantly low (2 h) at 90 °C but it requires a longer time of 24 h at 27 °C. The optimum sucrose concentration selected was 7 % (w/w) <b>of</b> <b>nodule</b> for maximum metal extraction. With use of 10 % (v/v) H 2 SO 4, 7 % (w/w) sucrose at 90 °C, and solid to liquid (S/L) ratio of 1 : 10 the achieved metal recovery figures were the following: Mn > 99 %, Ni 98 %, Cu 87 %, Co 83 % in 2 h.

40|$|Purpose: The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the risk of malignancy <b>of</b> thyroid <b>nodules</b> with minimal cystic changes. Methods: A total of consecutive 1, 000 thyroid nodules (≥ 1 cm) with final diagnoses from twoinstitutions were included in this study. The risk of malignancy <b>of</b> thyroid <b>nodules</b> was analyzed according to the internal content, which was categorized as purely solid, minimally cystic (cystic changes ≤ 10 %), and partially cystic (cystic changes > 10 %). We also assessed the risk <b>of</b> malignancy <b>of</b> <b>nodules</b> with minimal cystic changes depending on echogenicity and presence of any suspicious ultrasonografic (US) features. Results: The overall frequency of purely solid, minimally cystic, and partially cystic noduleswas 730 / 1, 000 (73 %), 61 / 1, 000 (6. 1 %), and 209 / 1, 000 (20. 9 %), respectively, with risks ofmalignancy of 14. 8 % (108 / 730), 3. 3 % (2 / 61), and 3. 3 % (7 / 209), respectively. The risk ofmalignancy <b>of</b> <b>nodules</b> with minimal cystic changes was significantly lower than that <b>of</b> purelysolid <b>nodules</b> (P= 0. 013). The risk <b>of</b> malignancy <b>of</b> <b>nodules</b> with minimal cystic changes was also lower than that <b>of</b> purely solid <b>nodules</b> in the group <b>of</b> hypoechoic <b>nodules</b> (P= 0. 063) and in the group <b>of</b> <b>nodules</b> with suspicious US features (P= 0. 028), but was not significantly different from that <b>of</b> partially cystic <b>nodules</b> regardless <b>of</b> echogenicity or the presence of suspicious US features (P≥ 0. 652). Conclusion: Thyroid nodules with minimal cystic changes have a low risk of malignancy, similar to that <b>of</b> partially cystic <b>nodules</b> regardless <b>of</b> echogenicity or the presence of suspicious US features. The US lexicon could define solid nodules as nodules with purely solid internal content in order to enhance the accuracy of estimated risks of malignancy...|$|R
