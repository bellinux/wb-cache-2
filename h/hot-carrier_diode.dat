40|$|A {{theory for}} a mixer using four MOSFETs in a {{broadband}} balanced-bridge configuration {{has been developed}} {{in terms of both}} ideal models and approximate representations for departures from the ideal case. An interfering signal is assumed to be present in order to analyze intermodulation and cross-modulation distortions. The mathematics of a MOSFET mixer are developed and compared with the conversion properties and intermodulation limitations of the simple nonlinear-resistance mixer. Measurements are made in the 10 - 200 MHz range and close agreement with the theory is found for conversion loss. Disagreement in RF and LO isolations is attributed to stray capacitances and impedance mismatching. It is also shown that circuit-board and transformer design greatly affects performance of a mixer. A comparison of MOSFET and <b>hot-carrier</b> <b>diode</b> double balanced mixers is given and it is indicated that the MOSFET mixer is superior in conversion loss and RF and LO isolations.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the leakage current of thin film silicon-on-insulator (SOI) pin-diodes in {{dependence of the}} back-gate potential and hot carrier induced traps. Leakage current of virgin and <b>hot-carrier</b> stressed <b>diodes</b> was measured at distinct back-gate potentials. TCAD simulations {{were used to determine}} the mechanisms of leakage current generation at specific back-gate potentials. Traps were introduced to study the impact of hot-carrier stress on the leakage current. Location, polarity and density of traps were considered. For a virgin device tunneling is predominant in inversion and accumulation. In full depletion surface generation dominates the leakage behavior. Surface and oxide traps shift the leakage current and alter its mechanism with increasing density, i. e. stress time. In inversion trap generation dominates at the top SOI interface. In depletion top and bottom interface traps are generated...|$|R
40|$|Low {{noise figure}} {{communication}} receivers require more efficient frequency converters. Frequency conversion and multiplication processes cannot take place without {{the existence of}} harmonic sources {{in the system and}} the inherent property of a nonlinear element is to generate harmonics. Such nonlinearity, in general, may be provided by semiconductor diodes. This research project deals with the theoretical analysis as well as the experimental verifications of the harmonic generating properties of a nonlinear resistive device, i. e. Schottky-barrier diode. Laboratory measurements associated with the equivalent circuit representation of <b>hot-carrier</b> <b>diodes</b> show that their i-v characteristics can be accurately described by the modified exponential law, i = I(_s) [exp α (V–iR(_T) - 1, over a wide range of the applied voltage V. Using this equation, a procedure is developed for the harmonic analysis of the resistive diode and calculation of any of a finite number of harmonic currents having a single frequency sinusoidal voltage V(_p) cos w(_p) t as the drive. The amplitudes of the harmonic currents are expressed as a power series in αR(_T) I(_S)) exp (αR(_T) I(_S)) where the coefficients of the power series are represented through the modified Bessel function of the k(^th) of order n. The integers k and n represent the power of the series and the harmonic number respectively, e. g. i(_n) α I(_n) (k α v(_p)) [αR(_T) I(_S) exp (αR(_T) I(_S)) ](^k). The power series solutions for the exponential diodes do not normally converge quickly enough to be of practical value for numerical evaluations. A different approach is proposed which is suitable for numerical evaluations of harmonic amplitudes. The results are compared with experimental data on twelve diodes, four {{in each of the three}} groups of different types. A good agreement, within the measuring instruments tolerances, was found between the calculated and the experimental results. Finally, it is believed that such studies were justified as the new method of approach presented here evaluates fully the capabilities of these diodes in practice. Many analyses published over the years have tended to introduce severe approximations which were only valid in practice over limited ranges of operation. In this project, attempts were made over almost two years to obtain mathematical solutions for the exponential diode law which are useful in practice and which give accurate prediction of harmonic amplitudes and spectrum. Various methods were employed to achieve the necessary convergence of the infinite series solutions. This involved a good understanding of the mathematical methods employed and computer programming. During the same period at every stage experimental verifications were being attempted, many times unsuccessfully, which finally led to a good agreement between the theory and experimental results as shown in this thesis...|$|R
