[...] "Christmas Time This Year" [...] is an anti-war song with a Mexican polka style, with Flaco Jiménez on accordion and Cooder on bajo sexto. Composed as a corrido, the song is about wounded soldiers returning home for Christmas, with dismal lyrics set incongruously to an upbeat Mexican melody. Cooder wrote the song in response to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center neglect scandal and previous stories of neglected soldiers returning from the Iraq War.

500|$|Ron {{speaks in}} a deadpan tone of voice and seldom expresses any kind of emotion, {{although}} he is often shown to be very giddy {{when it comes to}} riddles and meat. He adheres to many stereotypically masculine traits. He claims to have only cried twice: once when he was hit by a bus at age 7; secondly when miniature horse Li'l Sebastian died. Ron is an outdoor enthusiast who loves hunting, fishing, camping, and woodworking. For years, Ron has used a park ranger station in the woods as a lodge for private hunting trips with his male colleagues at city hall. He describes fishing as [...] "like yoga, except <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>get</b> to kill something." [...] He is particularly attracted to brunettes and what he describes as [...] "strong, self-possessed women {{at the top of their}} fields," [...] with professional athletes Steffi Graf and Sheryl Swoopes among his ideal women. He loves breakfast foods and red meats; among the types of food he enjoys are bacon-wrapped shrimp, fried turkey legs inside a grilled hamburger, and bacon-wrapped turkey legs, which are known in Pawnee as [...] "The Swanson." [...] He also drinks heavily but seldom feels the effects of alcohol or gets hung over. He primarily drinks scotch whisky, claiming that [...] "Clear alcohols are for rich women on diets." [...] He is an extremely private person, going so far as to redact his birthday from government documents to keep others from holding parties for him (though he did reluctantly provide it as [...] "springtime" [...] on a hospital admission form). Ron knows almost nothing about popular culture; he recognizes the name Julia Roberts only as the [...] "toothy gal from Mystic Pizza," [...] and he once confused the Star Wars film franchise with Harry Potter. He enjoys the music of Willie Nelson, being shown listening to [...] "Hello Walls" [...] and [...] "Buddy" [...] during the series. Ron is extremely concerned with the image people have of him and once refused to seek treatment for a hernia; he instead chose to remain immobile at his desk all day and night until April offered to take him to the hospital.|$|E

[...] He added: [...] "By early 1992 the KLF was easily the best-selling, probably the most innovative, and undoubtedly the most exhilarating pop phenomenon in Britain. In five years it had gone from pressing up 500 copies of its debut recording to being one of the world's top singles acts."

2500|$|The actress later {{reflected}} on Grace's transformation. She told Ellie Hooper from Closer that Grace was a [...] "one dimensional" [...] character when she debuted. She observed a [...] "big old change" [...] and viewers could finally see her heart amongst the evil. She became friendlier {{as a result}} of mothering Curtis and writers ensured Grace had more comedy about her character. She dreams of a normal life even though it is not achievable for her given her past. She can be [...] "a little bit of a freak" [...] in her pursuit of the perfect family life, but ultimately Wall believed Grace would never get her [...] "happily ever after". Wall enjoyed the complexities of Grace, adding [...] "the best thing about her is that <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>get</b> to be the big evil baddie who’s not very nice, but at the same time, I get to be funny and I get to have a love story."

He mentions the rumor in his 2004 autobiography, Hollywood Causes Cancer, stating that it apparently started when some Boston teenagers were caught videotaping themselves performing a similar stunt and when asked by security, they used the name [...] "Tom Green."

60|$|Mother, I {{am writing}} this in Major Hapgood's office, as usual. I am all alone to-day--Major is still absent, unwell, and the clerk is away somewhere. O how {{pleasant}} it is here--the weather I mean--and other things too, for that matter. I still occupy my little room, 394 L st.; get my own breakfast there; had good tea this morning, and some nice biscuit (yesterday morning and day before had peaches cut up). My friends the O'Connors that I wrote about recommenced cooking the 1st {{of this month}} (they have been, as usual in summer, taking their meals at a family hotel near by). Saturday they sent for me to breakfast, and Sunday I eat dinner with them--very good dinner, roast beef, lima beans, good potatoes, etc. They are truly friends to me. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>get</b> my dinner at a restaurant usually. I {{have a very good}} plain dinner, which is the only meal of any account I make during the day; but it is just as well, for I would be in danger of getting fat on the least encouragement, and I have no ambition that way. Mother, it is lucky I like Washington in many respects, and that things are upon the whole pleasant personally, for {{every day of my life}} I see enough to make one's heart ache with sympathy and anguish here in the hospitals, and I do not know as I could stand it if it was not counterbalanced outside. It is curious, when I am present at the most appalling things--deaths, operations, sickening wounds (perhaps full of maggots)--I do not fail, although my sympathies are very much excited, but keep singularly cool; but often hours afterward, perhaps when I am home or out walking alone, I feel sick and actually tremble when I recall the thing and have it in my mind again before me. Mother, did you see my letter in the N. Y. Times of Sunday, Oct. 4? That was the long-delayed letter. Mother, I am very sorry Jeff did not send me the Union with my letter in--I wish very much he could do so yet; and always when I have a letter in a paper I would like to have one sent. If you take the Union, send me some once in a while. Mother, was it Will Brown sent me those? Tell him if so I was much obliged; and if he or Mr. and Mrs. Brown take any interest in hearing my scribblings, mother, you let them read the letters, of course. O, I must not close without telling you the highly important intelligence that I have cut my hair and beard--since the event Rosecrans, Charleston, etc., etc., have among my acquaintances been hardly mentioned, being insignificant themes in comparison. Jeff, my dearest brother, I have been going to write you a good gossipy letter for two or three weeks past; will try to yet, so it will reach you for Sunday reading--so good-bye, Jeff, and good-bye for present, mother dear, and all, and tell Andrew he must not be discouraged yet.|$|E
