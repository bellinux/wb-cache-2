25|$|The <b>detrusor</b> {{muscle is}} {{a layer of}} the urinary bladder wall made of smooth muscle fibers {{arranged}} in spiral, longitudinal, and circular bundles. Stretch receptors in the bladder signal the parasympathetic nervous system to stimulate the muscarinic receptors in the <b>detrusor</b> to contract the muscle when the bladder is extended. This encourages the bladder to expel urine through the urethra. The main receptor activated is the M3 receptor, although M2 receptors are also involved and whilst outnumbering the M3 receptors they are not so responsive. The main relaxant pathway is via the adenylyl cyclase cAMP pathway, activated by Î²2 adrenergic receptors. The <b>detrusor</b> muscle is unusually able to change its length. It can also contract {{for a long time}} whilst voiding, and it stays relaxed whilst the bladder is filling.|$|E
25|$|It {{appears that}} paruresis {{involves}} a tightening of the sphincter and/or bladder neck {{due to a}} sympathetic nervous system response. The adrenaline rush that produces the involuntary nervous system response probably has peripheral and central nervous system involvement. The internal urethral sphincter (smooth muscle tissue) or the external urethral sphincter (striated muscle), levator ani (especially the pubococcygeus) muscle area, {{or some combination of}} the above, may be involved. It is possible that there is an inhibition of the <b>detrusor</b> command through a reflex pathway as well. The pontine micturition center (Barrington's nucleus) also may be involved, as its inhibition results in relaxation of the <b>detrusor</b> and prevents the relaxation of the internal sphincter.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} by which voluntary urination is initiated remains unsettled. One possibility is that the voluntary relaxation of {{the muscles of the}} pelvic floor causes a sufficient downward tug on the <b>detrusor</b> muscle to initiate its contraction. Another possibility is the excitation or disinhibition of neurons in the pontine micturition center, which causes concurrent contraction of the bladder and relaxation of the sphincter.|$|E
25|$|Inflammation of artery {{walls and}} tissue {{adjacent}} to nerves {{is common in}} tumors of abdominal and urogenital hollow organs. Infection or cancer may irritate the trigone of the urinary bladder, causing spasm of the <b>detrusor</b> urinae muscle (the muscle that squeezes urine from the urinary bladder), resulting in deep pain above the pubic bone, possibly referred {{to the tip of}} the penis, lasting from a few minutes to half an hour.|$|E
25|$|In healthy individuals, {{the lower}} urinary tract has two {{discrete}} phases of activity: the storage (or guarding) phase, when urine {{is stored in}} the bladder; and the voiding phase, when urine is released through the urethra. The state of the reflex system is dependent on both a conscious signal from the brain and the firing rate of sensory fibers from the bladder and urethra. At low bladder volumes, afferent firing is low, resulting in excitation of the outlet (the sphincter and urethra), and relaxation of the bladder. At high bladder volumes, afferent firing increases, causing a conscious sensation of urinary urge. When the individual is ready to urinate, he or she consciously initiates voiding, causing the bladder to contract and the outlet to relax. Voiding continues until the bladder empties completely, {{at which point the}} bladder relaxes and the outlet contracts to re-initiate storage. The muscles controlling micturition are controlled by the autonomic and somatic nervous systems. During the storage phase the internal urethral sphincter remains tense and the <b>detrusor</b> muscle relaxed by sympathetic stimulation. During micturition, parasympathetic stimulation causes the <b>detrusor</b> muscle to contract and the internal urethral sphincter to relax. The external urethral sphincter (sphincter urethrae) is under somatic control and is consciously relaxed during micturition.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{experiments}} done by Malysz et al. {{have looked}} into ethanol effects on voltage-gated calcium channels on <b>detrusor</b> smooth muscle cells in guinea pigs. Perforated patch clamp technique was used having intracellular fluid inside the pipette and extracellular fluid {{in the bath}} with added 0.3% vol/vol (about 50-mM) ethanol. Ethanol decreased the [...] current in DSM cells and induced muscle relaxation. Ethanol inhibits VGCCs and is involved in alcohol-induced relaxation of the urinary bladder.|$|E
2500|$|The main organs {{involved}} in urination are the urinary bladder and the urethra. The smooth muscle of the bladder, {{known as the}} <b>detrusor,</b> is innervated by sympathetic nervous system fibers from the lumbar spinal cord and parasympathetic fibers from the sacral spinal cord. Fibers in the pelvic nerves constitute the main afferent limb of the voiding reflex; the parasympathetic fibers to the bladder that constitute the excitatory efferent limb also travel in these nerves. Part of the urethra is surrounded by the male or female external urethral sphincter, which is innervated by the somatic pudendal nerve originating in the [...] cord, in an area termed Onuf's nucleus.|$|E
50|$|Bladder {{sphincter}} dyssynergia {{also known}} as <b>detrusor</b> sphincter dyssynergia is the decrease of <b>detrusor</b> (wall muscle of the bladder) pressure which causes unwanted urination. This is very common in spinal cord injuries and multiple sclerosis patients. There is a malfunction between the central nervous system, urinary sphincters, and <b>detrusor</b> muscles.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{a patient}} {{complaining}} of urinary urgency (or {{rushing to the}} toilet), with increased frequency of urination can have overactive bladder syndrome. The cause of this might be <b>detrusor</b> overactivity, in which the bladder muscle (the <b>detrusor)</b> contracts unexpectedly during bladder filling. Urodynamics {{can be used to}} confirm the presence of <b>detrusor</b> overactivity, which may help guide treatment. An overactive <b>detrusor</b> can be associated with urge incontinence. The American Urogynecologic Society does not recommend that urodynamics are part of initial diagnosis for uncomplicated overactive bladder.|$|E
50|$|The <b>detrusor</b> muscle, also <b>detrusor</b> urinae muscle, muscularis propria of the {{urinary bladder}} and (less precise) muscularis propria, is smooth muscle {{found in the}} wall of the bladder. The <b>detrusor</b> muscle remains relaxed to allow the bladder to store urine, and {{contracts}} during urination to release urine. Related are the urethral sphincter muscles which envelop the urethra to control the flow of urine when they contract.|$|E

50|$|During urination, <b>detrusor</b> {{muscles in}} {{the wall of the}} bladder contract, forcing urine out of the bladder and into the urethra. At the same time, {{sphincter}} muscles surrounding the urethra relax, letting urine pass out of the body. Incontinence will occur if the bladder muscles suddenly contract (<b>detrusor</b> muscle) or muscles surrounding the urethra suddenly relax (sphincter muscles).|$|E
5000|$|Bladder {{sphincter}} dyssynergia (also {{known as}} <b>detrusor</b> sphincter dysynergia (DSD) (the ICS standard terminology agreed 1998) [...] and neurogenic <b>detrusor</b> overactivity (NDO)) {{is a consequence}} of a neurological pathology such as spinal injury [...] or multiple sclerosis. which disrupts central nervous system regulation of the micturition (urination) reflex resulting in dyscoordination of the <b>detrusor</b> muscles of the bladder and the male or female external urethral sphincter muscles. In normal lower urinary tract function, these two separate muscle structures act in synergistic coordination. But in this neurogenic disorder, the urethral sphincter muscle, instead of relaxing completely during voiding, dyssynergically contracts causing the flow to be interrupted and the bladder pressure to rise.|$|E

50|$|The {{cause of}} OAB is unclear, and indeed {{there may be}} {{multiple}} causes. It {{is often associated with}} overactivity of the <b>detrusor</b> urinae muscle, a pattern of bladder muscle contraction observed during urodynamics. It is also possible that the increased contractile nature originates from within the urothelium and lamina propria, and abnormal contractions in this tissue could stimulate dysfunction in the <b>detrusor</b> or whole bladder.|$|E

50|$|The bladder {{is made of}} {{two types}} of muscles: the <b>detrusor,</b> a muscular sac that stores urine and squeezes to empty, and the sphincter, a {{circular}} group of muscles at the bottom or neck of the bladder that automatically stay contracted to hold the urine in and automatically relax when the <b>detrusor</b> contracts to let the urine into the urethra. A third group of muscles below the bladder (pelvic floor muscles) can contract to keep urine back.|$|E

50|$|In {{humans and}} other mammals, neurons in the PMC send {{descending}} excitatory projections to spinally located parasympathetic neurons controlling the <b>detrusor</b> muscle of the bladder and inhibitory interneurons regulating Onuf's nucleus. Additionally, the PMC receives ascending {{input from the}} level of the lumbosacral spinal cord. During bladder filling, neurons within the PMC are turned off. However, at a critical level of bladder distention the afferent information arising from mechanoreceptors in the <b>detrusor</b> switches the PMC on and enhances its activity. This activation results in relaxation of the male or female external urethral sphincter and contraction of the bladder. While operating as a spino bulbospinal reflex arc, this pattern of activity is also elicited through the conscious desire to urinate.|$|E
50|$|Neurourology {{concerns}} {{nervous system}} {{control of the}} genitourinary system, and of conditions causing abnormal urination. Neurological diseases and disorders such as a stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and spinal cord injury can disrupt the lower urinary tract and result in conditions such as urinary incontinence, <b>detrusor</b> overactivity, urinary retention, and <b>detrusor</b> sphincter dyssynergia. Urodynamic studies play an important diagnostic role in neurourology. Therapy for nervous system disorders includes clean intermittent self-catheterization of the bladder, anticholinergic drugs, injection of Botulinum toxin into the bladder wall and advanced and less commonly used therapies such as sacral neuromodulation.Less marked neurological abnormalities can cause urological disorders as wellâfor example, abnormalities of the sensory nervous system are thought by many researchers {{to play a role}} in disorders of painful or frequent urination (e.g. painful bladder syndrome also known as interstitial cystitis).|$|E
5000|$|Without {{diagnostic}} evaluation, {{the cause}} of UAB is unclear, as there are multiple possible causes. UAB symptoms can accurately reflect impaired bladder emptying due either to DU or obstruction (normal or large storage volumes, elevated post-void residual volume), or can result {{from a sense of}} incomplete emptying of a hypersensitive bladder (small storage volumes, normal or elevated postvoid residual volume). UAB potentially might also result from inaccurate perceptions of bladder function, such as in neurologic or psychiatric disease. DU itself is often linked to a weak <b>detrusor</b> muscle (impaired contractility), however this association is weak. Both UAB and DU have been associated with diminished sensitivity to bladder volumes rather than objective <b>detrusor</b> weakness, suggesting both symptoms (UAB) and function (DU) have a significant component of sensory dysfunction, leading to impaired bladder sensations and control (Smith et al., 2015).|$|E
50|$|Oxybutynin {{chloride}} exerts direct antispasmodic {{effect on}} smooth muscle and inhibits the muscarinic action of acetylcholine on smooth muscle. It exhibits {{one-fifth of the}} anticholinergic activity of atropine on the rabbit <b>detrusor</b> muscle, but four to ten times the antispasmodic activity. No blocking effects occur at skeletal neuromuscular junctions or autonomic ganglia (antinicotinic effects).|$|E
50|$|If {{the cause}} of {{nocturia}} {{is related to the}} obstruction of the prostate or an overactive bladder, surgical actions may be sought out. Transurethral prostatectomy/incision of the prostate and surgical correction of the pelvic organ prolapse, sacral nerve stimulation, clam cystoplasty, and <b>detrusor</b> myectomy are both treatment options and can help alleviate the symptoms of nocturia.|$|E
