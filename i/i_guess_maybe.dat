Starting off by filming family events like birthdays and holidays, he gradually began producing narrative films with his friends that incorporated stop-motion work and other special effects. Along with enjoying movies, Zemeckis remained an avid TV watcher. [...] "You hear {{so much about the}} problems with television," [...] he said, [...] "but I think that it saved my life." [...] Television gave Zemeckis his first glimpse of a world outside of his blue-collar upbringing; specifically, he learned of the existence of film schools on an episode of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. After seeing Bonnie and Clyde with his father and being heavily influenced by it, Zemeckis decided that {{he wanted to go to}} film school. His parents disapproved of the idea, Zemeckis later said, [...] "But only in the sense that they were concerned... for my [...] family and my friends and the world that I grew up in, this was the kind of dream that really was impossible. My parents would sit there and say, 'Don't you see where you come from? You can't be a movie director.' <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>maybe</b> some of it I felt I had to do in spite of them, too." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 1, 1910, Wedge {{was arrested}} and incarcerated in the city jail on charges of battery for {{attempting}} to strike a night watchman named Gus Miller and begging after being found on Fifth Street near Market Street at 4.30am. Wedge denied the allegations and explained his alcoholic odor as due to his incarceration with drunks and [...] "wine bums", and that he possessed port wine {{given to him by}} the Hahnemann Hospital to prevent pneumonia. Wedge was given the sobriquet [...] "The Fighting Parson of the Barbary Coast". In 1917 Wedge explained its origin: [...] "I was preaching on a beer keg in a saloon on the Barbary coast in San Francisco when a couple of toughs went for me. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>maybe</b> I cleaned out the place then. A reporter on the San Francisco newspaper gave me the name. He said I was a fellow who, if he could not preach good into men, would knock h—l out of them. Those fellows got me, though, and put me in the hospital for a while". After being hospitalized after a vicious assault by several denizens of the Barbary Coast at the corner of Pacific and Montgomery avenues, by the end of 1910 Wedge decided to return to Omaha to recuperate and to attempt to reconcile with Prudence Tracy.|$|E

5000|$|Several of {{her voice}} {{recordings}} (monologues), made between 1916 and 1924, are on file at the Library of Congress' National Jukebox. They include [...] "Washing baby" [...] (1921), [...] "The symphony concert" [...] (1923) and [...] "At the theatre" [...] (1924). [...] "At the theatre" [...] {{takes the form of}} a telephone conversation with an unheard party in which Cahill, as [...] "Mrs. Pinthrop," [...] describes goings-on—including the appearance of Marie Cahill ("Irish, <b>I</b> <b>guess...</b> well, <b>maybe</b> she is Jewish")—at the Palace Theatre.|$|R
5000|$|Courtney often {{expresses a}} wish that she were born a man, {{as in this}} {{conversation}} with her teacher Miss Rosen:"Don’t you {{think of yourself as}} a woman?” Miss Rosen said, amused.“No, not really,” Courtney said thoughtfully. “I don’t think the way they do. Men always tell me that I think like a man. It would be a lot simpler if I were a man. <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> But <b>maybe</b> it wouldn’t be. .../... Since I can remember I’ve dreamt that I am a man. I hardly even notice now that in all my dreams I’m myself, but a man. I wonder why that is,” she mused.|$|R

5000|$|An example can {{be taken}} from Ojibwe, an Algonquian {{language}} of North America. Verbs in Ojibwe can be marked with a dubitative suffix, indicating that the speaker is doubtful or uncertain {{about what they are}} saying. So aakozi means [...] "he is sick," [...] while aakozidog can be translated as something like [...] "he must be sick; <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> he's sick; <b>maybe</b> he's sick; he might be sick." ...|$|R
5000|$|Upam Buzarbaruah of The Times of India {{reviewed}} [...] "Now that we {{are done}} with the pleasantries, let's start a little dissection. First, acting. All the actors in the film have managed to take hamming to the next level. Kharaj Mukherjee, Shantilal Chakraborty, Supriyo Dutta, Biswajit Chakraborty and Shankar Chakraborty are right up there, at the top. The only non-hammers were {{the girls in the}} cast and Hiran, as Ankush, Soham leave no stone unturned to act as loud as possible. But <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> that's <b>maybe</b> because the director wouldn't settle for less. But the result was a hamfest, with each actor trying to out-overact the others. Music. Well, can't say it's bad; just run-of-the-mill commercial stuff that makes you shake a leg for a week or so before fading into oblivion." ...|$|R

But I'll hand them a few tricks before I lose. My first move will be to give Henderson his release." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Golly! I {{could go}} to Europe, to Europe! now, if I wanted to, and have maybe two plunks over, for grub on the railroad.

500|$|The {{story was}} commended by several critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, [...] "I've {{never met anyone}} like Forrest Gump in a movie before, {{and for that matter}} I've never seen a movie quite like 'Forrest Gump.' Any attempt to {{describe}} him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let me try. It's a comedy, <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> Or <b>maybe</b> a drama. Or a dream. The screenplay by Eric Roth has the complexity of modern fiction...The performance is a breathtaking balancing act between comedy and sadness, in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths...What a magical movie." [...] Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote that the film [...] "has been very well worked out on all levels, and manages the difficult feat of being an intimate, even delicate tale played with an appealingly light touch against an epic backdrop." [...] The film did receive notable pans from several major reviewers. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker called the film [...] "Warm, wise, and wearisome as hell." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly said that the film [...] "reduces the tumult of the last few decades to a virtual-reality theme park: a baby-boomer version of Disney's America." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 4,000 members: The Federal {{indictment}} says, [...] "Shadowcrew was {{an international}} organization of approximately 4,000 members…" [...] The last available page before October 27, 2004 on archive.org shows 2,709 registered FOUND. To {{people familiar with}} the ShadowCrew forum, {{it is well known that}} many members had multiple user names. Members who were banned from the forum would frequently register with another user name as well. Lastly, the forum was around for over 2 years so there were likely many inactive accounts. NOTE: Clarification: There were member who had multiple IDs. And certainly member who were kicked would often re-register under another name. BUT, there was also a need by members to develop a name that could be trusted. SO the idea that most the registered user were duplicates isn't accurate. Out of 4,000, <b>I</b> would <b>guess</b> that <b>maybe</b> 1000 were duplicates. Maybe a few more.|$|R
