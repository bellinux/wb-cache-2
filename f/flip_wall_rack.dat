Originally {{the room had}} been square, and rather crudely {{plastered}} and wallpapered, but a wooden partition had afterward been erected to cut the room into two, so that the portion she had entered was long and narrow. Its sole furniture consisted of the round table, quite bare, two or three wooden-bottomed chairs, and against one <b>wall</b> a <b>rack</b> filled with books. During the interview she noted that these books were mostly directories of the inhabitants of various prominent cities in the United States, and such a collection astonished her and aroused her curiosity.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} reconstructs, wherever possible, {{the interior}} of the Cape house between 1670 and 1714 from the evidence preserved in surviving inventories and vendu rolls located in the Cape Archives. Chapter I examines those inventories which contribute something to our knowledge of the architecture of the period. Chapter II reconstructs certain features of doors, windows, fireplaces etc., from clues in the inventories and vendu rolls. Chapter III considers the way the different rooms in a cape house were furnished, and relates this to the developments in interior organisation and design that were taking place in seventeenth-century Europe in general and the Hague in particular. Chapter IV examines beds, window curtains, seat furniture, footstools, footwarmers and screens. Chapter V examines tables, carpets, chests, coffers, cupboards, cabinets, writing boxes, cellarets, mirrors, pictures, and <b>wall</b> <b>racks.</b> Chapter VI deals with lighting equipment, aids to cleanliness, basketware, skins, leatherware and cooperage. Chapter VII examines the various items devoted to eating and drinking. Chapter VIII covers the domestic pursuits: smoking, reading, writing, sewing, knitting, spinning, music, indoor games, clocks, watches, scientific instruments, weapons and domestic pets. The Conclusion attempts to place the domestic world at the Cape in the context of contemporary Dutch culture. Comparisons are drawn between the Cape and other Dutch societies, and particularly between the Cape inventories and those of the Hague and New York, in order to pinpoint those qualities and features which are unique to the Cape house and the people who lived in it.

50|$|After 1662, Gijsbrechts {{abandoned}} the pure vanitas still life paintings {{to allow the}} vanitas motifs to enter into more complex trompe l’oeil compositions as partial elements, e.g. in the so-called studio <b>walls,</b> letter <b>racks</b> (the notice boards of the era), board walls with hunting implements and musical instruments, and “chantournés” (cut-outs). The latter took the deception of the eye one step further, as the painted tree or linen was also cut in a shape meant to fool spectators into believing that they were {{standing in front of}} a three-dimensional object. For the illusion to be convincing, Gijsbrechts primarily painted motifs and objects naturally found in the surroundings of the royal family, and he painted these as close to the natural sizes as possible.|$|R

50|$|Rack-mountable {{equipment}} is traditionally mounted by bolting or clipping its front panel to the rack. Within the IT industry, {{it is common}} for network/communications equipment to have multiple mounting positions, including table-top and <b>wall</b> mounting, so <b>rack</b> mountable equipment will often feature L-brackets that must be screwed or bolted to the equipment prior to mounting in a 19-inch rack. With the prevalence of 23-inch racks in the Telecoms industry, the same practice is also common, but with equipment having 19-inch and 23-inch brackets available, enabling them to be mounted in existing racks.|$|R
