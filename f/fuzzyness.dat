Concepts of sectional fuzzy continuous mappings and strong uniformly convex fuzzy normed linear spaces have been introduced by Bag and Samanta [4]. Bag and Samanta [5] introduced a notion of boundedness of a linear operator between fuzzy normed spaces, and studied the relation between fuzzy continuity and fuzzy boundedness. They studied boundedness of linear operators over fuzzy normed linear spaces such as fuzzy continuity, sequential fuzzy continuity, weakly fuzzy continuity and strongly fuzzy continuity.|$|E

Qualification in all its guises (certification, geographic provenance, industry labels [...] .) and venues (state, private, third-party [...] .) relies on an institutional frame that is all the more necessary as markets collapse when consumer confidence in foods disappears.

40|$|Most component-based {{approaches}} to elaborate software require complete and consistent descriptions of components, but in practical settings components information is incomplete, imprecise and changing, and requirements may be likewise. More realistically deployable are approaches that combine exploration of candidate architectures with their evaluation vis-a-vis requirements, {{and deal with}} the <b>fuzzyness</b> of available component information. This article presents an approach to systematic generation, evaluation and re-generation of component assemblies, using potentially incomplete, imprecise, unreliable and changing descriptions of requirements and components. The key ideas are representation of NFRs using architectural policies, systematic reification of policies into mechanisms and components that implement them, multi-dimensional characterizations of these three levels, and catalogs of them. The Azimut framework embodies these ideas and enables traceability of architecture by supporting architecture-level reasoning, and allows architects to engage into systematic exploration of design spaces. A detailed illustrative example illustrates the approach. 1 st International Workshop on Advanced Software Engineering: Expanding the Frontiers of Software Technology - Session 1 : Software Architectur...|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} papers {{we introduced}} the computational information conservation theory (CICT) approach for the mathematical {{treatment of the}} spacetime splitting in nanoscale electromagnetic, bioelectromagnetic and arbitrary multiscale system modeling problems, to get more effective and reliable biophysical and biomedical engineering simulation solutions. In fact, traditional finite difference calculus and even more sophisticated and advanced algebraic approaches are unable to conserve overall system information. Unfortunately, misplaced precision leads to information opacity, <b>fuzzyness,</b> irreversibility, chaos, complexity and confusion. Eventually, our overview suggests us that to grasp a more reliable representation of experimental reality and to get stronger physical and biological system correlates, researchers and scientists need two intelligently articulated hands: both stochastic and combinatorial approaches synergistically articulated by natural coupling.

In particular, we discuss applications of these concepts to the exponential time complexity classes E and E 2. Moreover, we treat time-bounded genericity and stochasticity concepts which are weaker than time-bounded randomness but which suffice {{for many of}} the applications in complexity theory. 1 Introduction The first attempt for defining the concept of a random sequence goes back to von Mises [vM 19] in 1919. He proposed that an infinite 0 - 1 -sequence S should be considered to be random if, in the limit, the number of the occurrences of the 0 s and 1 s in S is the same (i. e. the sequence S satisfies the law of large numbers) and if this stability property is inherited by every infinite subsequence of S obtained by an admissible selection rule.

40|$|International audienceLikelog is a fuzzy–logic {{language}} with a Prolog-like syntax augmented with similarity equations (modeling the fuzzy {{component of the}} language) and with an operational semantics based on resolution where the classical syntactic unification algorithm of pure logic programming {{has been replaced by}} a similarity-based unification method. On the other hand, Curry is a functional–logic {{language with}} a Haskell-like syntax and an operational principle based on (needed) narrowing, that is, a combination of syntactic unification and rewriting. In this paper we propose a new similarity-based unification method which empowers the original one used in Likelog by also taking into account functional features like laziness. This calculus is specially well suited for being embedded into the kernel of the original needed narrowing strategy of Curry in a very natural way, also verifying nice formal properties such as termination, crispness (i. e., it computes at least the same elements of the crisp case) and <b>fuzzyness</b> (i. e., similarities collected in a given program are exploited as much as possible). Our final goal is to achieve the complete integration of the (also integrated) declarative paradigms of functional– logic and fuzzy–logic programming, in order to obtain a richer and much more expressive programming scheme where mathematical functions cohabit with fuzzy logic features...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRough {{set theory}} {{is a useful}} tool for dealing with <b>fuzzyness</b> and {{uncertainty}} of knowledge. In rough set theory, knowledge reductions and generatings are important research topics and critical steps of knowledge acquisition. This paper generalize knowledge bases to abstract knowledge bases and study (abstract) knowledge bases on infinite universe by considering the problem of existence of finite reductions of infinite knowledge bases. For abstract knowledge bases, the concept of saturations and saturation reductions are introduced. Global properties of saturations and saturation reductions of abstract knowledge bases are investigated. It is proved that for a given abstract knowledge base which is closed w. r. t. arbitrary unions on a finite universe U, its saturation augmented the unverse U forms a topology, whereas a counterexample is constructed to show that this may not be true if U is infinite. Making use of the saturation of an abstract knowledge base, some sufficient and/or necessary conditions for existence of finite reductions of an infinite abstract knowledge base are given. It is proved that for an abstract knowledge base on finite universe, there is one and only one saturation reduction. Some examples are constructed to reveal various cases of existence of knowledge reductions. Simple applications of saturation reductions are also given...|$|E
40|$|In quantum theory, real {{degrees of}} freedom are usually {{described}} by operators which are self-adjoint. There are, however, exceptions to the rule. This is because, in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, an operator is not necessarily self-adjoint even if its expectation values are real. Instead, the operator may be merely symmetric. Such operators are not diagonalizable - {{and as a consequence}} they describe real {{degrees of freedom}} which display a form of "unsharpness" or "fuzzyness". For example, there are indications that this type of operators could arise with the description of space-time at the string or at the Planck scale, where some form of unsharpness or <b>fuzzyness</b> has long been conjectured. A priori, however, a potential problem with merely symmetric operators is the fact that, unlike self-adjoint operators, they do not generate unitaries - at least not straightforwardly. Here, we show for a large class of these operators that they do generate unitaries in a well defined way, and that these operators even generate the entire unitary group of the Hilbert space. This shows that merely symmetric operators, in addition to describing unsharp physical entities, may indeed also play a r{ô}le in the generation of symmetries, e. g. within a fundamental theory of quantum gravity...|$|E
30|$|Nowadays, graphs do not {{represent}} all the systems like networks, routes, schedules, images, etc. properly due to the uncertainty or haziness of the parameters of systems. For example, a social network may be represented as a graph, where vertices represent an account (person, institution, etc.) and edges represent the relation between those accounts. If the relations among accounts are measured as either good or bad according to the frequency of contacts among those accounts, then <b>fuzzyness</b> can be added for such representations. This and many other problems lead to define fuzzy graphs. The first definition of a fuzzy graph was introduced by Kauffman (1973). But, Rosenfeld (1975) described fuzzy relations on fuzzy sets and developed some theory of fuzzy graphs. Using these concept of fuzzy graphs, Koczy (1992) discussed fuzzy graphs to evaluate and to optimize any networks. Samanta and Pal (2013) showed that fuzzy graphs {{can be used in}} competition in ecosystems. After that, they introduced some different types of fuzzy graphs (Samanta and Pal 2015; Samanta et al. 2014). Bhutani and Battou (2003) and Bhutani and Rosenfeld (2003) discussed different arcs in fuzzy graphs. For further details of fuzzy graphs, readers may look in Mathew (2009), Mordeson and Nair (2000), Pramanik et al. (2014, 2016) and Rashmanlou et al. (2015).

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to develop an {{approach}} for the decomposition of complex business problems into smaller parallel and executable units. Tools and methods were developed and applied, which allowed scalability within a workstation cluster of the identified, distributed and parallel units. The developed planning-object-method was applied {{for the creation of}} a planning model of the production planning and control (PPC). The degree of freedom for the system design were used in such a fashion that parallel executable planning objects were defined, which are linked by means of co-ordination mechanisms. Thereby the interdependencies of the original planning problem are supported and the planning security is increased. The decomposition into parallel planning problems and the consideration of the existing <b>fuzzyness</b> of planning objects by means of fuzzy logic increases the flexibility and reduces reaction times as well as through put times in the PPC. The technical implementation of the system had to consider the typical system infrastructure of small to medium enterprises and the used standard software and hardware. Therefore a system prototype was implemented and tested with the identified planning objects from the PPC-model using Windows and a PC-cluster. (orig.)

As a simple application of the gauge theory, we find the appropriate equivariant connection form for different lapses of the ADM action. In a Kaluza-Klein context, for all metric-velocity independent lapses we have global conservation equations involving 3 -curvature. For the BSW [4] lapse-fixed version of the ADM action, even though there are no conservation equations, the connection is not well-defined.
