5|$|Group 12 metals are chalcophiles, {{meaning the}} {{elements}} have low affinities for oxides and prefer {{to bond with}} sulfides. Chalcophiles formed as the crust solidified under the reducing conditions of the early Earth's atmosphere. The commercially most important minerals of group 12 elements are sulfide minerals. Sphalerite, which {{is a form of}} zinc sulfide, is the most heavily mined zinc-containing ore because its concentrate contains 60–62% zinc. No significant deposits of cadmium-containing ores are known. <b>Greenockite</b> (CdS), the only cadmium mineral of importance, is nearly always associated with sphalerite (ZnS). This association is caused by the geochemical similarity between zinc and cadmium which makes geological separation unlikely. As a consequence, cadmium is produced mainly as a byproduct from mining, smelting, and refining sulfidic ores of zinc, and, to a lesser degree, lead and copper. One place where metallic cadmium can be found is the Vilyuy River basin in Siberia. Although mercury is an extremely rare element in the Earth's crust, because it does not blend geochemically with those elements that constitute the majority of the crustal mass, mercury ores can be highly concentrated considering the element's abundance in ordinary rock. The richest mercury ores contain up to 2.5% mercury by mass, and even the leanest concentrated deposits are at least 0.1% mercury (12,000 times average crustal abundance). It is found either as a native metal (rare) or in cinnabar (HgS), corderoite, livingstonite and other minerals, with cinnabar being the most common ore.|$|E

It is confined to Miocene—Pliocene andesites and basalts of the Aguacate Group volcanic arc. Gold-bearing quartz veins are related to fault and fracture of steep inclinations, accompanied by pronounced hydrothermal alteration. The key tectonic zones strike NW—SE but the majority of the ore veins are controlled by local extensional structures of Riedel shear type in the NE—SW, N—S to NNW—SSE directions. The brecciation, mylonitization and healing of deformed structures suggest that three main pulses of mineralization took place during the hydrothermal process. The gold is present as electrum (30 and 42 wt. % Ag) tiny inclusions up to 25 µm in size enclosed in quartz, pyrite and arsenopyrite. The other ore minerals are chalcopyrite, galena, sphalerite and marcasite and less abundant to scarce acanthite, pyrargyrite, <b>greenockite,</b> covellite, bornite and cassiterite. The principal elements exhibiting significant positive correlations with Au are Ag, Sb, As, Pb and Hg.

The preparation and characterization of different chalcogenides have attracted a considerable attention due to their important nonlinear properties, luminiscent properties and other important physical and chemical properties. The main cause is in their unusual properties based on the high concentration of atoms in interfacial structures and the relatively simple ways of their preparation. Nanoparticles of semiconductors have many potential applications {{in the area of}} advanced materials. These materials can be synthesized via solid state reactions where the recovery degree can be strongly enhanced by the intervention of mechanical activation. Mechanochemical synthesis belongs among the synthesis route which can effectively control and regulate the course of solid state reactions. This paper describes structural and surface properties of cadmium sulphide nanoparticles synthesized in a planetary mill and in an eccentric vibratory mill. The main aim of this paper was to illustrate the potential of this technique for the large-scale production of CdS nanopowder. CdS nanoparticles were successfully synthesized by the mechanochemical route from the cadmium acetate and natrium sulphide. Structure properties of the as-prepared products were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction. X-ray diffraction patterns reveal the crystalline nature of CdS nanoparticles. Hexagonal ¿-CdS <b>greenockite</b> together with cubic hawleyite À-CdS are present among the products of mechanochemical synthesis.

40|$|The Niujiaotang zinc deposit {{in southeastern}} Guizhou, China, is a Mississippi Valley-type Zn deposit within Early Cambrian {{carbonate}} rocks. Sphalerite is enriched in cadmium (average 1. 4 wt. % Cd), which occurs mostly as isomorphous impurities in the sphalerite lattice. Discrete cadmium minerals (<b>greenockite</b> and otavite) are rare and are found {{almost exclusively in}} the oxidation zone of the deposit, probably formed as secondary minerals during weathering–leaching processes. Geochemical data show that the sulfides are enriched in heavy sulfur, with δ 34 S ranging from + 10. 0 ‰ to + 32. 8 ‰ (mean + 22. 5 ‰). The consistent Pb isotopic compositions in different sulfide minerals are {{similar to that of}} Cambrian strata. The ore lead probably came from U- and Th-rich upper crustal rocks, such as the Lower Cambrian Wuxun Formation. The ore fluid is of low-temperature (101 °C to 142 °C) type, with a Na–Ca–Mg–Cl-dominant composition, and is interpreted as oil-field brine. The data indicate that the metals were mainly derived from the Early Cambrian strata (Qingxudong and Wuxun Formations), whereas sulfur is sourced from sulfate in Cambrian strata or oil-field brines of the Majiang petroleum paleoreservoir. The genetic model for the deposit invokes an Early Cambrian shallow-sea environment on the Yangtze Platform. Zinc and Cd in seawater were concentrated in abundant algae via unknown biological mechanisms, resulting in large amounts of Znand Cd-rich algal ooliths.

40|$|This article {{provides}} an overview on the inorganic chemistry of cadmium. Cadmium is a bluish-white metal, the 67 th most abundant element in the Earth's crust, and found in some minerals. The structure of the stable form at room temperature (form) is hexagonal. Occurrence, production, and applications have been surveyed. CdII forms relatively few minerals: the most important are two sulfides, <b>greenockite,</b> and hawleyite. CdII, however, gives isomorphous replacement in several Zn minerals. For this reason, sphalerite (ZnS) is the main industrial source of cadmium. The metal is mainly obtained as a by-product of the metallurgy of Zn. Cadmium and its compounds find applications in several industrial materials: electrode materials in Ni–Cd batteries and solar cells; pigments in ceramics, glasses, paper, plastics, artist colors; coatings on steel, aluminum, and other nonferrous metals; specialized alloys; polymer stabilizers, and in nuclear industry and lab applications. 111 Cd and 113 Cd NMR spectroscopy {{can be used to}} study complexes, both in solid state and in solution, mostly to investigate the binding site of the metal ion in different metalloproteins. Toxicological and environmental risks are associated with its use. Cadmium compounds are highly toxic, and human exposure to this metal is known to be involved in cancer and other diseases. The targets are the body's cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, neurological, reproductive, and respiratory systems. Cadmium does not seem to play any important role in higher organisms. The usual oxidation state of cadmium is 2 + and its chemistry closely resembles that of zinc and, to a lesser extend, mercury. Few compounds of CdI have been prepared and identified. CdII within zeolites is easily reduced by exposure to metal vapors to form cationic clusters containing Cd 0 and CdI. The versatile coordination ability of CdII allows a wide variety of structures. The main compounds, ordered by metal oxidation state and bound anion, have been examined for their properties and structural aspects, both in solution and in the solid state. Several technologies have been developed to obtain cadmium compounds as nanocrystals or nanostructures. Cadmium glasses can find applications for their nonlinear optical properties...|$|E

The rock hosting both primary and secondary ores is a strongly dolomitized carbonate platform limestone of the Jurassic Shuqra Formation (Amran Group). The primary sulfides consist of sphalerite, galena and pyrite/marcasite. Smithsonite is the most abundant economic mineral in the secondary deposit, and is associated with minor hydrozincite, hemimorphite, acanthite and <b>greenockite.</b> Smithsonite occurs as two main generations: smithsonite 1, which replaces both host dolomite and sphalerite, and smithsonite 2, occurring as concretions and vein fillings in the host rock. At the boundary between smithsonite 1 and host dolomite, the latter is widely replaced by broad, irregular bands of Zn-bearing dolomite, where Zn has substituted for Mg. The secondary mineralization evolved through different stages: 1) alteration of original sulfides (sphalerite, pyrite and galena), and release of metals in acid solutions; 2) alteration of dolomite host rock and formation of Zn-bearing dolomite; 3) partial dissolution of dolomite by metal-carrying acid fluids and replacement of dolomite and Zn-bearing dolomite by a first smithsonite phase (smithsonite 1). To this stage also belong the direct replacement of sphalerite and galena by secondary minerals (smithsonite and cerussite); 4) precipitation of a later smithsonite phase (smithsonite 2) in veins and cavities, together with Ag- and Cd-sulfides. The δ 18 O composition of Jabali smithsonite is generally lower than in other known supergene smithsonites, whereas the carbon isotope composition {{is in the same}} range of the negative δ 13 C values recorded in most supergene nonsulfide ores. Considering that the groundwaters and paleo-groundwaters in this area of Yemen have negative δ 18 O values, it can be assumed that the Jabali smithsonite precipitated in different stages from a combination of fluids, possibly consisting of local groundwaters variably mixed with low-temperature hydrothermal waters. The carbon isotope composition is interpreted as a result of mixing between carbon from host rock carbonates and soil/atmospheric CO 2. The most favorable setting {{for the development of the}} Jabali secondary deposit could be placed in the early Miocene (~ 17 Ma), when supergene weathering was favored by major uplift and exhumation resulting from the main phase of Red Sea extension. Low-temperature hydrothermal fluids may have also circulated at the same time, through the magmatically-induced geothermal activity in the area...|$|E
40|$|This item is only {{available}} electronically. The Challenger gold deposit, northwest Gawler Craton, South Australia, underwent granulite-facies metamorphism during the Sleafordian orogeny. Since its discovery, debate {{has focused on}} the genetic history of the Challenger deposit and whether the mineralisation is metamorphogenic (synorogenic) or metamorphosed (pre-metamorphic precursor). Unlike other studies that have targeted the silicate assemblages in the wallrock to understand ore evolution, the present study attempts to unravel part of the genetic history from the ore minerals themselves, specifically from the main ore minerals (löllingite, arsenopyrite and pyrrhotite) and various trace minerals. The study is also the first which has been able to access the entire strike of the M 2 orebody, which forms the mainstay of current exploitation. One goal of the work was to establish if distinctions could be made between mineralogy and textures in the M 2 orebody and those in distinct high-grade areas of the deposit. By integrating microscopy, electron probe analysis, determination of trace element distributions in ore minerals by laser-ablation ICP mass spectroscopy (LA-ICP-MS), electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) and transmission electron microscopy of pyrrhotite, the study has established that grain-scale remobilisation of lattice-bound gold to form visible gold took place by mineral-fluid interaction via coupled dissolution-reprecipitation reaction. This is in addition to the melt-assisted remobilisation of Au, which is considered to account for the high-grade ore. The study shows that the ore mineral assemblage in M 2 ore is broadly similar to that of M 1, except that there are some significant differences with respect to the association of gold; Au-Ag-Te associations appear to be more important in M 2 than Au-Bi associations described in earlier publications. The LA-ICP-MS data show that tens of ppm Au are retained in the löllingite lattice, but that coexisting arsenopyrite is a very poor host for invisible Au. The trace element contents of the two minerals in different textural settings can help to constrain the metamorphic development of the ore. Furthermore, the pioneering attempt to use EBSD to study associations of löllingite and arsenopyrite show promise for relating gold remobilisation to deformation. Mineral assemblages and trace element signatures observed in the present study are consistent with a precursor, zoned, epithermal-style deposit. The mineral inventory of the Challenger deposit has been expanded by the identification of several telluride minerals previously unreported from Challenger (hessite, petzite, hedleyite, volynskite), as well as <b>greenockite,</b> scheelite and gahnite. Two less-common pyrrhotite types (3 C and 1 C) are also reported. The presence of Ag-rich electrum, sub-microscopic gold at reaction fronts between arsenopyrite and löllingite, „invisible‟ gold in löllingite, and the presence of graphite in the M 2 ore, all carry implications for mineral processing and gold recovery.

40|$|International audienceTazieffite, ideally Pb 20 Cd 2 (As,Bi) 22 S 50 Cl 10, {{is a new}} mineral {{from the}} {{high-temperature}} fumaroles of the Mutnovsky volcano, Kamchatka Peninsula, Russian Federation. It occurs as tiny, slender, needle-shaped crystals, up to 400 µm long and 10 µm across, generally forming fibrous aggregates. Tazieffite is closely associated with <b>greenockite,</b> galena, mutnovskite, kudriavite, and Cd-rich cannizzarite. Other minerals spatially associated are pyrite, anhydrite, and cristobalite. Tazieffite is silvery-gray in color, occasionally with a magenta tint when it forms aggregates of extremely fine needles. It has a black streak and metallic luster. In plane-polarized incident light, tazieffite is weakly bireflectant and weakly pleochroic from dark gray to a blue-gray. Between crossed polars, the mineral is weakly anisotropic, without characteristic rotation tints. Reflectance percentages measured in air (Rmin and Rmax) for a single grain are 33. 9, 34. 1 (471. 1 nm), 32. 8, 33. 0 (548. 3 nm), 32. 4, 32. 6 (586. 6 nm), and 30. 9, 31. 1 (652. 3 nm), respectively. Electron microprobe analyses yield the following ranges of concentrations: Pb 41. 88 – 44. 14 (avg. 42. 90), Cd 0. 87 – 1. 16 (avg. 1. 03), Sn 0. 31 – 0. 69 (avg. 0. 48), Bi 20. 43 – 22. 94 (avg. 21. 90), As 8. 64 – 10. 73 (avg. 9. 66), S 16. 10 – 17. 48 (avg. 16. 58), Se 0. 82 – 1. 28 (avg. 1. 04), Cl 2. 39 – 2. 77 (avg. 2. 63), Br 0. 09 – 0. 15 (avg. 0. 12), I 0. 27 – 0. 58 (avg. 0. 42). The empirical chemical formula, calculated {{on the basis of}} 44 cations, is Pb 20. 06 (Cd 0. 89 Sn 0. 39 In 0. 02) Σ 1. 30 (As 12. 49 Bi 10. 15) Σ 22. 64 (S 50. 08 Se 1. 28) Σ 51. 36 (Cl 7. 18 I 0. 32 Br 0. 15) Σ 7. 65. Tazieffite is closely related to the halogen-sulfosalt vurroite, Pb 20 Sn 2 Bi 22 S 54 Cl 6, both from a chemical and structural point of view. It represents the (Cd,As) -dominant of vurroite, according to the coupled heterovalent substitution Sn 4 + + 2 S 2 – → Cd 2 + + 2 Cl–. The crystal structure of tazieffite was refined in the space group C 2 /c to R = 0. 0370 for 4271 reflections with I > 2 σ(I). Unit-cell parameters are a = 8. 3520 (17), b = 45. 5920 (92), c = 27. 2610 (55) Å, β = 98. 84 (3) °, with V = 10257 (4) Å 3, and Z = 4. The structure of tazieffite consists of lozenge-shaped composite rods made of coordination polyhedra of Pb around an octahedrally coordinated (Cd,Sn,Pb) position, interconnected into layers parallel to (010). These layers are separated by ribbons of As and Bi in distorted octahedral coordination. The ribbons form wavy, discontinuous double layers of the PbS archetype. Lone electron pairs of As and Bi are accommodated in the central portions of the PbS-like layers. The possibility that small amounts of NH 4 + are incorporated in the crystal structure of tazieffite is discussed. The name of this new mineral species (IMA 2008 - 012) honors Haroun Tazieff (Warszawa, May 11, 1914 –Paris, February 6, 1998), famous Belgian/French volcanologist, who was a pioneer in the field study of volcanoes and devoted his life to the study of volcanic gases...|$|E
