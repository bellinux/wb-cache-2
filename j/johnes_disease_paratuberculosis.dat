40|$|<b>Johne’s</b> <b>Disease</b> (JD) is a chronic, production-limiting {{disease that}} {{is very hard to}} detect, infects mostly calves under 6 months of age and stays for life with {{only a few of the}} calves showing {{clinical}} signs as adults. Alberta Agriculture and Food (AF) performed several surveys in the last few years to determine the extent of JD in the province. In beef cattle, JD appears to have a low individual prevalence, but a large geographical distribution in a high number of herds. In dairy cattle, the prevalence of JD at both the individual animal and the herd level is high with a wide geographical distribution in the province. Alberta Agriculture and Food coordinates and implements several programs and projects in conjunction with producers and veterinarians to prevent, control and eradicate JD from the herds in the province. The implementation of best management practices, biosecurity and strategic testing are important tools to reduce the risk of infection to newborn calves and to evaluate the status and progression of any on-farm program. Overview <b>Johne’s</b> <b>Disease</b> (<b>paratuberculosis)</b> is a chronic intestinal infection of ruminants that causes inflammation and fibrosis of the intestinal lining. This results in reduced absorption of nutrients, diarrhea, progressive loss of body condition that compromises overall health and immunity, and eventual death (Radostits et al., 2000). The causative agent is the Mycobacterium avium subspecie paratuberculosis (MAP), which is an acid-fast, slow growing gram-positive bacteria (Barrow and Felttham, 1993). The epidemiology of the disease is different in dairy and beef herds mainly due to management factors (Humphry et al., 2006). This results in differences in cow and herd prevalenc...|$|R
40|$|The {{capacity}} of a commercially available gamma interferon (IFNγ) assay to detect infected sheep early in the pathogenesis of <b>Johne's</b> <b>disease</b> enables the removal of such animals from the flock before bacterial shedding and pasture contamination. However, nonspecific IFNγ responses in the assay have meant that to achieve high-test specificity, {{there has been a}} reduction in sensitivity. Although the optimal conditions {{for the use of the}} assay in cattle have been well documented, there have been few studies optimizing the assay for use in sheep. The current study details the effect of anticoagulant, duration of incubation, cell concentration, blood storage temperature, time of stimulation of cells with antigen relative to time of sample collection, and temperatures during transit on IFNγ synthesis. Maximal IFNγ synthesis occurred with incubation periods of 48 hr in blood collected into heparinized tubes. Decreasing the leukocyte population by diluting the total peripheral blood leukocyte concentration was associated with a decreasing IFNγ response. Conversely, concentrating the peripheral blood concentration 2 -fold resulted in an increase in the IFNγ production. In field studies, immediate incubation of blood samples with antigen at 37 °C resulted in larger IFNγ responses; however, significantly lower IFNγ values were obtained if the samples were transported at ambient temperature. The results of this study indicate that optimization of the IFNγ assay may enable increased synthesis of IFNγ during the stimulation phase of the assay and that future work may determine whether this translates to increased sensitivity of the assay in detecting early infections in sheep.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the performance of detection of IgG isotypes in a PPA-ELISA to improve the recognition of cattle naturally infected with Map in different stages. A total of 108 animals from Tuberculosis-free herds were grouped as follows: exposed (n= 30), subclinically infected (n= 26), clinically infected (n= 14), and healthy controls (n= 38). Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves of isotypes/PPA-ELISAs were constructed and areas under the curves were compared to evaluate the performance of each test. Our study demonstrated that the conventional PPA-ELISA (detecting IgG) is the best to identify clinically infected animals with high sensitivity (92. 9 %) and specificity (100 %). Meanwhile, IgG 2 /PPA-ELISA improved the number of subclinically infected cattle detected as compared with conventional IgG/PPA-ELISA (53. 8 versus 23. 1 %). In addition, it had the maximum sensitivity (65. 0 %, taking into account all Map-infected cattle).

CLA is now a disease of minimal concern, with clinical cases reported rarely. Although OJD continues to spread through parts of the sheep population, the catastrophic losses in flocks occurring prior {{to the introduction of}} vaccination are now uncommon. Change-management factors relevant to the improvements in both prevalence and producer concerns for CLA and OJD were examined, including drivers and motivation for change, resistance to change, knowledge management, farming system dimensions and leadership. Although extension programs addressing disease risk factors are likely to be of relevance to improved knowledge and attitudes towards disease risk management of producers, improvements in disease-control practices were considered largely attributable to the introduction of vaccination programs for CLA in 1983 and OJD in 2002. Inclusion of the CLA antigen within clostridial vaccines (“ 6 in 1 ” vaccine) enabled routine annual CLA vaccination to occur in an increasing proportion of the national flock, with estimates of CLA prevalence suggesting a decline from 26 % in 1995 to 5. 2 % in 2009. Encouraging the routine vaccination of lambs for OJD (Gudair vaccine) in infected flocks to reduce or avoid losses significantly reduced the within-flock prevaccination–postvaccination median prevalence from 2. 72 % to 0. 72 %, based on estimated shedding rates of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis determined by pooled fecal culture in 37 infected flocks vaccinating for at least 5 years. Although persistent use of CLA vaccine is a convenient intervention for producers, promoting the persistent use of OJD vaccination to continue disease suppression when clinical cases are undetectable, plus improvements in biosecurity, remain a challenge for animal-health authorities. Despite concerns of vaccine efficacy and safety issues with OJD vaccination, persistent vaccination has produced a profound improvement in the health of Australian sheep, and is a positive development of relevance to sheep production in other countries.

Analysis of macrophage transcriptomes in response to Map infection is expected to provide key missing information {{in the understanding of}} the role of this pathogen in establishing an inappropriate and persistent infection in a susceptible host and of the molecular mechanisms that might underlie the early phases of CD. In this paper we summarize transcriptomic studies of human and bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), and macrophages-like cell lines in vitro infected withMap. Most studies included in this paper consistently reported common gene expression signatures of bovine and humanmacrophages in response toMap such as enhanced expression of the anti-in�ammatory cytokines IL- 10 and IL- 6, which promote bacterial survival. Overexpression of IL- 10 could be responsible for theMap-associated reduction in the expression of the proapoptotic TNF...|$|R
40|$|Background: Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) causes chronic {{enteritis}} {{in a wide}} range of animal species. In cattle, MAP causes a chronic <b>disease</b> called <b>Johne’s</b> <b>disease,</b> or <b>paratuberculosis,</b> that is not treatable and the efficacy of vaccine control is controversial. The clinical phase of the disease is characterised by diarrhoea, weight loss, drop in milk production and eventually death. Susceptibility to MAP infection is heritable with heritability estimates ranging from 0. 06 to 0. 10. There have been several studies over the last few years that have identified genetic loci putatively associated with MAP susceptibility, however, with the availability of genome-wide high density SNP maker panels it is now possible to carry out association studies that have higher precision. Methodology/Principal Findings: The objective of the current study was to localize genes having an impact on <b>Johne’s</b> <b>disease</b> susceptibility using the latest bovine genome information and a high density SNP panel (Illumina BovineSNP 50 BeadChip) to perform a case/control, genome-wide association analysis. Samples from MAP case and negative controls were selected from field samples collected in 2007 and 2008 in the province of Lombardy, Italy. Cases were defined as animals serologically positive for MAP by ELISA. In total 966 samples were genotyped: 483 MAP ELISA positive and 483 ELISA negative. Samples were selected randomly among those collected from 119 farms which had at least one positive animal. Conclusion/Significance: The analysis of the genotype data identified several chromosomal regions associated with diseas...|$|R
40|$|<b>Johne's</b> <b>disease</b> or <b>paratuberculosis</b> in cattle {{is caused}} by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). Although the stages of {{infection}} have been well described, very few virulence factors of MAP have been studied in detail. We aimed to study the localization and immunogenicity {{of members of the}} polymorphic PPE protein family which is unique to Mycobacteria and has been linked to virulence in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). The presence of PPE proteins in the cell wall was investigated by enzymatic digest of surface exposed proteins of live MAP bacteria and analysis by LC-MS/MS. Polyclonal antisera were generated against a recombinant fragment of one PPE protein and a synthetic peptide of the other to confirm their surface exposure. Sera from naturally infected cows were investigated for the presence of specific antibodies against the recombinant PPE protein. Two PPE proteins, Map 3420 c and Map 1506, were detected by mass spectrometry and confirmed to be surface exposed on live MAP cells by immunohistochemistry. The sera from naturally infected animals contained specific antibodies against recombinantly expressed Map 3420 c as demonstrated by western blotting. These findings show the in vitro expression of two PPE proteins. Additionally the surface exposure and immunogenicity of PPE proteins of MAP was demonstrated. Source type: Electronic(1...|$|R
40|$|<b>Johne’s</b> <b>disease</b> or <b>paratuberculosis</b> is {{a chronic}} granulomatous {{enteritis}} in ruminants caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. <b>paratuberculosis</b> (MAP). The <b>disease</b> {{is responsible for}} significant economic losses in dairy industry worldwide.   Microbial culture as a golden standard test for detection of MAP in faecal specimens requires 6 - 16 weeks to complete, whereas accurate and rapid identification of cattle shedding MAP in their feces is essential for successful control of the disease in herds. In the present study, direct microbial diagnosis by Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast staining, microbial culture on Herrolds’ egg yolk media and two IS 900 direct PCR assays were carried out on 100 fecal specimens of apparently healthy cattle collected from dairy herds of Tabriz {{with a history of}} <b>Johne’s</b> <b>disease.</b> The number of positive specimens identified by the direct microbial diagnosis, microbial culture and PCR with F 90 /F 91 and FP 25 /FP 26 primes were 7 (7 %), 14 (14 %), 15 (15 %) and 25 (25 %) respectively. These results indicated that PCR detected more positive cases therefore it can be employed for rapid and accurate diagnosis of cattle shedding MAP it their feces and the type of primer used has {{a significant role in the}} sensitivity of this test. Direct microbial diagnosis by Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast staining identified 7 (7 %) specimens, two IS 900 direct PCR assays identified 15 (15 %) and 25 (25 %) specimens, respectively, and microbial culture identified 7 (7 %) specimens as positive. Collectively, these data indicate that PCR detection of MAP was more sensitive than direct microbial diagnosis by Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast staining or faecal culture, especially if appropriate primers were used...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is a {{zoonotic}} pathogen, a {{very slow}} growing bacterium which is difficult to isolate and passage in conventional laboratory culture. Although its association with <b>Johne’s</b> <b>disease</b> or <b>paratuberculosis</b> of cattle is well established, it has been only putatively linked to Crohn’s disease in humans. Further, MAP has been recently suggested to be a trigger for other autoimmune diseases such as type- 1 diabetes mellitus (T 1 DM). Recently, some {{studies have indicated that}} exposure to MAP is associated with elevated levels of antibodies against MAP lysate although the exact mechanism and significance of the same remains unclear. Further, the cytokine profiles relevant in MAP associated diseases of humans and their exact role in the pathophysiology are not clearly known. We performed in vitro cytokine analyses after exposing different cultured human cells to the whole cell lysate of MAP and found that MAP lysate induces secretion of cytokines IL- 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 8, IL- 10 and TNF-α by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Also, it induces secretion of IL- 8 by cultured human stomach adenocarcinoma cells (AGS) and PANC- 1 (human pancreatic carcinoma cell line) cells. We also found that MAP lysate induced cytotoxicity in PANC- 1 cells. Collectively, these results provide a much needed base-line data set of cytokines broadly signifying a MAP induced cellular response by human cells. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Mycobacterium avium {{subspecies}} paratuberculosis (MAP) is the causative {{agent of}} <b>Johne's</b> <b>disease</b> (JD), or <b>paratuberculosis</b> in ruminants has been suspected to be {{implicated in the}} pathogenesis of Crohn's disease (CD) in humans with chronic inflammatory intestinal changes. As the hypothesis is now fast being recognized that MAP could possibly be the etiological agent of CD which {{is found to be}} excreted in milk of dairy animals subclinically or terminally ill with JD. Aim: The present study was aimed to detect MAP in milk by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting IS 900 and to describe the excretion pattern of MAP in milk from asymptomatic lactating cows and does with relevance to the public health significance. Materials and Methods: A total of 77 milk samples were collected randomly from lactating animals which include cows (45) and does (32). All the 77 milk samples were processed to identify the presence of MAP by employing the direct IS 900 PCR as per the standard protocol. Results: Out of 77 milk samples from asymptomatic lactating animals, 12 (15. 58...|$|R
40|$|Ovine <b>Johne's</b> <b>disease,</b> or <b>paratuberculosis,</b> {{occurs in}} many countries. In Australia, {{surveillance}} using serology {{is used as}} part of a control program, but the testing regime is costly relative to its sensitivity. For this reason, culturing of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis in fecal samples pooled from a number of sheep was evaluated. Initially, the effect of pooling on the sensitivity of fecal culture was evaluated using samples from 20 sheep with multibacillary paratuberculosis and 20 sheep with paucibacillary paratuberculosis, each confirmed histologically. All multibacillary cases and 50 % of paucibacillary cases were detected by culturing of feces at a pooling rate of 1 infected plus 49 uninfected sheep. In a pilot-scale study in 1997, M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis was detected by pooled fecal culture on 93 % of 27 infected farms which were identified originally based on history, clinical signs, and one or more rounds of testing using serologic and histopathologic examinations. Pooled fecal culture was compared with serologic examination for submissions from 335 farms where both tests had been conducted on the same sheep and was significantly more sensitive (P < 0. 001). Computer simulation of random sampling indicated that the testing of 6 pools of 50 sheep would provide 95 % confidence in detecting ≥ 2 % prevalence of infection. The estimated laboratory cost of pooled fecal culture when applied as a flock test is approximately 30 % that of serologic examination, and sample collection costs are lower. It is recommended that pooled fecal culture replace serologic examination for detection of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis infection at the flock level...|$|R
