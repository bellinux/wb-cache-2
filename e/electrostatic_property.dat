40|$|Abstract: For {{conventional}} electrical actuators, {{the materials}} are mainly made up of metals, which mean they are prone to corrosion and electrical sparking. Replacing these systems with polymer metal composite based materials can be solved both problems. Considering their excellent electromechanical property, low device fabrication cost, light weight, and good electrical conductivity, the actuator based on ionic polymer metal composite (IPMC) was fabricated using Nafion film, NaOH 0. 1 molar solution, and Au electrode. IPMCs exhibit good <b>electrostatic</b> <b>property</b> which means they can in principle be used in making actuators based on electromechanical motions. The resistance measurements of Nafion film after soaking in NaOH and deionized water were demonstrated and compared each other. The result of sample soaked in NaOH showed better electrical conductivity than in deionized water. The fabricated IPMC actuator exhibits a large deformation of bending displacement of approximately 9 mm with applied low AC voltage 6. 89 V at 2. 84 Hz. The result of computer simulation was also very similar and shown as a bending displacement of 8. 6085 mm...|$|E

Two complexes have the different substituent in the positions next to the nitrogen of pyridine moiety in bis(2 -pyridylmethyl) amine (bpa) ligand.

The e-field responds differently to different crowding agents-dextran, Ficoll, BSA, and E. coli cell lysate. Dextran and Ficoll {{have no effect on}} the e-field. The lysate generally weakens the e-field but the amplitude of weakening varies greatly. For example, the e-field by K 19 is reduced by 67 % in the presence of 90 g/L lysate, corresponding to a charge change from 0. 9 to 0. 3 e for K 19, whereas the e-fields by D/K 40 are weakened only by, similar to 7 % under the same lysate concentration. The extent of the e-field weakening by BSA is in between that by Ficoll (dextran) and lysate. Further investigations, suggest that the e-field weakening mechanism by lysate is similar to that by NaCl. That is, the e-field generated by a protein surface charge affects the distribution of lysate which creates a reaction field and weakens the protein e-field.

40|$|They {{finding that}} eluted mesangial IgA and serum IgA from {{patients}} with IgA nephropathy (IgAN) had a restricted anionic charge contrasting with normal serum IgA prompted us {{to examine the}} charge of κ- and λ-subclasses of IgA. Previous studies are not totally satisfactory because either total IgA without further dividing into subclass or only κ- and λ-IgA 1 was examined. A new approach is described to study the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>property</b> of total IgA and its light chain subclasses. The new focused antigen capture immunoassay (FACIA) allows us to separate the immunoglobulins by isoelectric point, then to capture by the heavy chain class and finally to visualize according to the light chain class. This method works well with whole blood or serum without the need of prior purification by affinity chromatography. The serum total IgA and λ-IgA levels in patients with IgAN {{were significantly higher than}} that of healthy controls. Elevated λ-IgA levels in patients with IgAN resulted in reduced κ/λ ratio of total IgA. Similar to our previous findings in IgA 1 with O-linked oligosaccharide side chain, λ- IgA from patients with IgAN or health controls is highly anionic whereas κ- IgA is relatively cationic. The higher anionic/cationic ratio observed in total IgA from patients compared with controls was due to the higher concentration of λ-IgA from the former group. Raised antonio λ-IgA in IgAN may be contributory to the immumopathogenesis through its selective mesangial binding. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{bifurcation}} {{nature of}} the electrostatic structure is studied in the toroidal helical plasma of the Compact Helical System (CHS) [K. Matsuoka et al., Proceedings of the 12 th International Conference on Plasma Physics and Controlled Nuclear Fusion Research, Nice, 1988 (International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna, 1989), Vol. 2, p. 411]. Observation of bifurcation-related phenomena is introduced, such as characteristic patterns of discrete potential profiles, and various patterns of self-sustained oscillations termed electric pulsation. Some patterns of the electrostatic structure {{are found to be}} quite important for fusion application owing to their association with transport barrier formation. It is confirmed, as is shown in several tokamak experiments, that the thermal transport barrier is linked with electrostatic structure through the radial electric field shear that can reduce the fluctuation resulting in anomalous transport. This article describes in detail spatio-temporal evolution during self-sustained oscillation, together with correlation between the radial electric field and other plasma parameters. An experimental survey to find dependence of the temporal and spatial patterns on plasma parameters is performed in order to understand systematically the bifurcation property of the toroidal helical plasma. The experimental results are compared with the neoclassical bifurcation property that is believed to explain the observed bifurcation property of the CHS plasmas. The present results show that the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>property</b> plays an essential role in the structural formation of toroidal helical plasmas, and demonstrate that toroidal plasma is an open system with a strong nonlinearity to provide a new attractive problem to be studied...|$|E

40|$|The {{electrostatic}} {{interactions in}} the channels of OmpF and PhoE porins from Escherichia coli were analysed {{on the basis}} of a macroscopic multi-dielectric model of the protein-membrane complex derived from the respective porin X-ray structures. The membrane was represented as layers of distinct dielectric constants corresponding to the aliphatic core and the polar head groups of the lipids. The pKa values of the titratable groups and the electrostatic field in the region of the channel were calculated by the finite difference technique. In spite of the differences in sequences and charge constellations, the calculated electrostatic properties of the two porins are similar in several aspects: (1) unusual titration behaviour (pKa below 7) was found for some groups of the cluster of basic residues at the constriction of the pore; (2) a number of acidic groups buried between the internal loop and the barrel wall are stabilized in their protonated forms at neutral pH; (3) there is a strong transverse electrostatic field in the channel characterized by a screw-like form. The strength of the field is greatest at the region of the constriction zone. This would facilitate the diffusion of solutes with a large dipole moment such as free amino acids. Differences between the electrostatic fields of OmpF and PhoE are mainly confined to that end of the pore that faces the cell exterior in vivo. In OmpF the electrostatic potential is close to zero in this region of the channel, whereas a positive potential was found in PhoE. It was shown that the experimentally observed difference in ion selectivity of the two porins can largely be attributed to this distinct <b>electrostatic</b> <b>property...</b>|$|E
40|$|Quorum sensing (QS) plays {{a central}} role in {{virulence}} induction in the commensal pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus. This bacterium secretes an auto-inducer peptide (AIP), a small, cyclic peptide containing a thiolactone linkage as an indicator of its population density, and up-regulates virulence gene expression in response to high extracellular AIP levels. We have investigated two key biochemical events in S. aureus QS and revealed several underlying regulatory mechanisms. The first such event, formation of the high energy thiolactone in AIP, is unusual in that it occurs directly through proteolysis of the precursor peptide, AgrD, without free-energy input from ATP hydrolysis. We showed that this proteolysis is, in line with the thermodynamic prediction, unfavorable and strongly reversible in vitro. As a consequence, rapid degradation of the concomitantly released C-terminal fragment of AgrD is required to power efficient AIP production in vivo. This observation provides a novel connection between protein homeostasis and QS in S. aureus. The second study focused on the AIP-sensing receptor histidine kinase (HK), AgrC, whose auto-phosphorylation exhibits several remarkable properties in our reconstitution system based on nanometer-scale lipid-bilayer discs (nanodiscs). Activation of this receptor by its native activator, for instance, requires a membrane environment enriched of anionic lipids mimicking the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>property</b> of the S. aureus cell membrane. This strong dependence on lipid composition might explain why homologous QS systems exist only in low-GC Gram-positive bacteria, or Firmicutes, whose cell membranes are predominantly highly anionic. AgrC also binds to ATP at an exceptionally weak affinity, likely due to its distinct adenine-binding pocket conserved only in a small subfamily of HK receptors existing also exclusively in Firmicutes. The low affinity to the nucleotide cofactor likely enables AgrC to sense the energy condition of the bacterium and shut down the QS regardless of the population density when energy starvation drives down the cellular ATP level. Even more intriguing is the plasticity of AgrC auto-kinase activity when bound to different ligands. This behavior contrasts with the generally accepted two-state model of HKs. To understand the plasticity of AgrC, we systematically perturbed the conformation of the AgrC kinase domain using a fusion protein strategy. We demonstrated that the conformational state of a helical linker preceding the kinase domain exercises rheostat-like control over the kinase activity. Using full-length AgrC embedded in nanodiscs, we showed that binding of activator and inhibitor peptides results in twisting of the linker in different directions. These findings provide the first view on molecular motions triggered by ligand binding on a membrane bound receptor HK. The smooth input-response landscape of the AgrC kinase domain also sheds new light on the mechanism of HK evolution through domain shuffling...|$|E

Genes in the HLA class II region encode molecules that present antigen to T lymphocytes. Polymorphisms in these genes are associated with most autoimmune diseases, most likely because they contribute to the specificity of immune responses. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the structure and <b>electrostatic</b> <b>properties</b> of the peptide-binding groove of HLA-DR in relation to PSC. Thus, four-digit resolution HLA-DRB 1 genotyping was performed in 356 PSC patients and 366 healthy controls. Sequence information was used to assign which amino acids were encoded at all polymorphic positions. In stepwise logistic regressions, variations at residues 37 and 86 were independently associated with PSC (P = 1. 2 × 10 − 32 and P = 1. 8 × 10 − 22 in single-residue models, respectively). Three-dimensional modeling was performed to explore the effect of these key residues on the HLA-DR molecule. This analysis indicated that residue 37 was a major determinant of the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>properties</b> of pocket P 9 of the peptide-binding groove. Asparagine at residue 37, which was associated with PSC, induced a positive charge in pocket P 9. Tyrosine, which protected against PSC, induced a negative charge in this pocket. Consistent with the statistical observations, variation at residue 86 also indirectly influenced the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>properties</b> of this pocket. DRB 1 * 13 : 01, which was PSC-associated, had a positive P 9 pocket and DRB 1 * 13 : 02, protective against PSC, had a negative P 9 pocket. Conclusion: The results suggest that in patients with PSC, residues 37 and 86 of the HLA-DRβ chain critically influence the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>properties</b> of pocket P 9 and thereby the range of peptides presented.
