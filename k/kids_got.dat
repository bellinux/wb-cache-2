500|$|In general, {{the world}} of these early volumes is a [...] " [...] and ... divided place." [...] In these early titles, the boys are cynical about human nature, an {{attitude}} apparently justified when the police, whom they have repeatedly helped, throw them into jail on slim evidence in The Great Airport Mystery (1930). The police and authority figures in general come off poorly in these books, {{so much so that}} at one point Edward Stratemeyer wrote McFarlane to reprimand him for [...] "grievous lack of respect for officers of the law." [...] The Hardys are less affluent than earlier Stratemeyer characters; they eagerly accept cash rewards largely to finance college educations, and, with their parents, strive to please their Aunt Gertrude, because she possesses a small fortune. The rich are portrayed as greedy and selfish. This view of the world reflects McFarlane's relative [...] "lack [...] sympathy with the American power structure." [...] In his autobiography, McFarlane described his rationale for writing the books this way, writing: [...] "I had my own thoughts about teaching youngsters that obedience to authority is somehow sacred.... Would civilization crumble if <b>kids</b> <b>got</b> the notion that the people who ran the world were sometimes stupid, occasionally wrong and even corrupt at times?" ...|$|E

Many times I held them, blood all over me. The worst feeling I had was that you can’t help them at all...I saw kids and adults got hit in the head, by the bullets, crawling. So I don't believe in crawling anymore. I just stood up and shoot like hell...I fought about two or three months. The thing that I couldn't take is to watch my friends dying every day. That's the worst feeling." ...|$|E

Other performers on the tour were Chuck Berry and Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers. When Perkins and the group entered the stage in Columbia, South Carolina, he was appalled to see a teenager with a bleeding chin pressed against the stage by the crowd. During the first guitar intermission of [...] "Honey Don't" [...] they were waved offstage and into a vacant dressing room behind a double line of police officers. Perkins was quoted as saying, [...] "It was dangerous. Lot of <b>kids</b> <b>got</b> hurt. There was a lot of rioting going on, just crazy, man! The music drove 'em insane."
