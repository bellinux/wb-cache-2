The findings of this indicate that lower-income households {{are more likely to}} move to central cities over the suburbs because not only are they poorer but also they are more unstable in their life perspectives, such as residential, employment, and social situations. The householder/metropolitan two-level logistic regression analysis show that the availability of consumption opportunities (transit services, rental housing, and affordable housing price) have stronger explanatory power for central city/suburb locational choice than the availability of job opportunities. The study sheds additional light on the relationship between poverty and the urban environment, particularly the way unstable low-income households might rely on positive agglomeration effects of cities for improving their consumption opportunities. ...|$|R
40|$|MA Geografie, PU vir CHO, 1986 This {{study is}} aimed at {{determining}} {{the relative importance of}} <b>external</b> agglomeration <b>economies</b> for metal industries in Vanderbijlpark, by way of an analysis of certain quantifiable industrial linkages. Vanderbijlpark is situated within the most important industrial concentration area in the RSA, viz. the PWV area. In 1980, the industrial sector within the PWV• area contributed 53, 2 % in GGP to the country's total industrial output [Bureau for Market Research, 1982 : 8, 9]. Therefore, within the South African context, the PWV area, or a sub-region within this area, forms an ideal territory for an investigation into <b>external</b> agglomeration <b>economies.</b> The term, (external} agglomeration economies, is well known, especially in the literature on industrial development. Confusion nevertheless exists regarding the meaning and extent of the term, because no generally accepted description or criterion exists for these economies. This gap results in uncertainty regarding the role of <b>external</b> agglomeration <b>economies</b> within metropolitan or urban areas, and especially its influence on intra-urban industrial development. The use of industrial linkages as a criterion for <b>external</b> agglomeration <b>economies,</b> is also a topic on which there is no general agreement. By making use of a conceptual framework, certain theoretical standpoints, as well as empirical findings on industrial location, <b>external</b> agglomeration <b>economies</b> and industrial linkages have been integrated. In this way it was indicated that certain industrial linkages can potentially reflect <b>external</b> agglomeration <b>economies.</b> Consequently, four hypotheses -were developed to verify these standpoints. The two secondary hypotheses are aimed •at determining the linkage tendencies which could be associated with internal/external factors. The findings according to these hypotheses, confirm the theoretically-founded standpoint that: <b>External</b> agglomeration <b>economies</b> should not necessarily be associated only with local industrial linkages within urban areas where industries are located, but can extend over longer distances within metropolitan areas; Industrial linkages, which are used as a criterion for <b>external</b> agglomeration <b>economies,</b> must comply with certain requirements, and they must therefore be analysed on an individual basis. The two primary hypotheses are aimed at linking <b>external</b> agglomeration <b>economies</b> to certain industrial linkages. This has been accomplished by making use of the agglomeration orientation concept, which takes the abovementioned standpoints further. It has been found that 36 % of the metal industries in Vanderbijlpark are meaningfully influenced by <b>external</b> agglomeration <b>economies.</b> Following this, and allowing for the character of the activities with which linkage takes place, the industrial linkages of agglomeration orientated metal industries have been assigned, to the various components of <b>external</b> agglomeration <b>economies,</b> viz: Urbanization economies - Localization economies Industrial complex economies. It has been found that industrial complex economies and localization economies are of greater importance to metal industries in Vanderbijlpark than urbanization economies. This finding is in accordance with the metal-orientated industrial character of the area. The findings in this study suggest that quantifiable industrial linkages can thus be used to obtain greater clarity regarding the influence of <b>external</b> agglomeration <b>economies</b> within urban areas.

The second benefit is the development of industries due to the increasing returns to scale in intermediate inputs for a product; and the third source is the relative ease of communication and exchange of supplies, laborers and innovative ideas due to the proximity among firms.|$|E

However, population concentration will cause high costs, urban disease, and enlarging regional disparities. It is necessary to push forward new urbanization. First, the general layout of urbanization should be designed to form a unified national market to reduce obstacles among separated markets in different cities {{to take advantage of}} the scale economy of a large country. On the other hand, reasonable measures must be taken to optimize the concentration of urbanization and maximize the benefit of the scale <b>economy</b> and <b>external</b> <b>economy.</b> Second, regarding the relation of urban scale and urban development, the road of urban clustering development emphasizes the coordination of large, middle, and small cities. The road of central city driving small cities should be changed. According to the principle of marginal cost being equal to marginal revenue, cities of different sizes are built in the different regions based on position, transportation, resources, environment, factors, and market conditions. Infrastructure networks will connect all cities to form an urban ribbon and to complement each other, so that all cities will benefit from the <b>external</b> <b>economy.</b> Third, walk the road of integration between urban and rural areas, that is, the integration of industry and agriculture, urban and rural, and urban citizens and rural residents. The dual structure of urban and rural economies should be broken to promote urban and rural areas complementing each other and lasting prosperity. Industry feeds back into agriculture by transfer payments to support rural vulnerable groups.|$|R
50|$|The {{large-scale}} programme {{of industrialization}} advocated by this model requires huge investments which {{are beyond the}} means of the private sector. The investment in infrastructure and basic industries (like power, transport and communications) is 'lumpy' and has long gestation periods. The role of the state in this theory is therefore critical for investment in social overhead capital. Even if the private sector had the requisite resources to invest in such a programme, it would not do so since it is driven by profit motives. Many investments are profitable in terms of social marginal net product but not in terms of private marginal net product. Due to this there is no incentive for individual entrepreneurs to invest and take advantage of <b>external</b> <b>economies.</b>|$|E

As the preface and the contents of August Lösch's Die räumliche Ordnung der Wirtschaft (Jena: Gustav Fischer, 1940; 2nd ed., 1944), whose English translation was made in 1954 by W. H.

There are also several other enterprises which have been privatized after the war, such as: Ferronikeli in 2005, Llamkos Galvasteel in 2005, and Sharrcem in 2000. These enterprises: Ferronikeli in Drenas, a nickel mining and smelting complex; Sharrcem in Han i Elezit, a miner of limestone and manufacturer of cement; and Llamkos Galvasteel in Vushtrri, a manufacturer of steel, were [...] "industrial champions" [...] in the former Yugoslavia. Investments in the mining and metals sector in Kosovo have been very low and even declining during 2007-2011; however, this industry constitutes the largest portion of Kosovo’s exports. The mining and metals industry provides almost 76% of the export revenues in Kosovo. This has also contributed to decreasing {{a portion of the}} rent-based income in Kosovo and increasing the real-economy income in Kosovo. Nevertheless, there are many structural imbalances in this sector and although it constitutes a high portion of the exports, the industry is also heavily dependent upon imports. The mining and metals industry in Kosovo shows a lack of internal integration, which means that there are few links in the production process between different segments in the industry and {{there is a need for}} investments in the field. Also, by establishing new enterprises in the mining and metals sector, Kosovo was able to decrease its current account deficit in 2011 by around 537 million Euros.Although metal processing developed quickly within the mining and metal industry during 2003-2011 and it increased export revenues by 16-fold, it was not able to encourage production linkages within the industry. During 2009-2011 the only mining licenses issued were to existing companies in Kosovo and only 5 were issued for extraction projects. During 2003-2011 imports also increased of ore and ore concentrates which were then processed locally and re-exported. While ores extracted by private companies or at Trepča are exported and further on processed and refined out of Kosovo, the domestic manufacturing industry uses processed metals imported from abroad. Thus, there are no linkages within the metals and mining industry in Kosovo and the industry is fully dependent linked with <b>external</b> <b>economies.</b> The extractive sector, although it is increasing in importance, it still remains at a relatively low level of 1.1% of GDP (2010) and significantly lower than its level prior to the war and the 90s.In 2008, the export of nickel ingots amounted to almost half of the whole exports value. The mining sector contributes relatively low to GDP (approximately 1%). Base metals accounted for almost 33% of all exports in 2010.
