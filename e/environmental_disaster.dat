5|$|Hydrocarbon {{exploration}} {{in deep water}} occasionally results in significant environmental degradation resulting mainly from accumulation of contaminated drill cuttings, but also from oil spills. While the oil gusher involved in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico originates from a wellhead only 1500meters below the ocean surface, it nevertheless illustrates the kind of <b>environmental</b> <b>disaster</b> that can result from mishaps related to offshore drilling for oil and gas.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} that followed, {{scientists}} and doctors studied the smog's impact. It {{became clear that the}} smog had been a major <b>environmental</b> <b>disaster</b> with severe public health effects. One study estimated that 10 percent of the city's population suffered adverse health effects, such as stinging eyes, coughing, and respiratory distress. City health officials initially maintained that the smog had not caused any deaths. Later, a statistical analysis found that 168 people had likely died because of the smog. Another study found that the smog had shortened the lifespans of 366 people.|$|E

Although there is an {{increase}} of <b>environmental</b> <b>disasters</b> and migration over the past years, the relationship is complex. While some authors find that <b>environmental</b> <b>disasters</b> increase migration, others show that they have only a marginal or no effect or are even negative. Migration {{appears to be an}} insurance mechanism against environmental shocks. Remittances help to decrease households' vulnerability to shocks but also dampen their adverse effects. Finally, we discuss policy implications and future research avenues...|$|R

25|$|The {{controversy}} over the proposed Pebble mine centers largely on the potential risk to the watershed, salmon and other fisheries.

The restoration reportedly gave rise to long-absent rain clouds and possible microclimate changes, bringing tentative hope to an agricultural sector swallowed by a regional dustbowl, and some expansion of the shrunken sea.|$|E

As {{a result of this}} and other investigations, in June 2001, a complaint of an <b>environmental</b> <b>disaster</b> was presented to the Public Prosecutor's Office of Brescia. Research on the adult population of Brescia showed that residents of some urban areas, former workers of the plant, and consumers of contaminated food, have PCB levels in their bodies that are in many cases 10-20 times higher than reference values in comparable general populations. PCBs entered the human food supply by animals grazing on contaminated pastures near the factory, especially in local veal mostly eaten by farmers' families. The exposed population showed an elevated risk of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but not for other specific cancers.|$|E
