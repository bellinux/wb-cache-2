5|$|In early September, the German Army {{had sent}} a strong force into San Marino to <b>defend</b> <b>it</b> against the Allies; this would also give them control {{of one of the}} major roads in the area, and allow {{artillery}} observers to occupy the mountain peaks. The defending force was drawn from the 278. Infanterie-Division, whilst the 4th Indian Division was assigned to attack it on the 17th.|$|E
5|$|Muscat was a {{drain on}} Portuguese finances, with its {{requirement}} to maintain large military and naval forces to <b>defend</b> <b>it.</b> Trade did not prosper as hoped since the Persian market was closed to them until 1630.

Finding the village unoccupied they left a company behind to <b>defend</b> <b>it,</b> and at 08:30 {{the rest of}} the {{battalion}} headed for Escoville. They arrived at the village at 11:00 having only been confronted by sniper fire. The Germans assembling on the heights overlooking the village attacked at 15:00. Fighting at close quarters and house to house, by 16:00 the battalion was forced to withdraw back to Herourvillette. The battle cost them 87 casualties, including the CO.|$|E
5|$|Concerned by the US carrier {{strikes in}} the Marshall Islands, Lae-Salamaua, and the Doolittle raids, Yamamoto was {{determined}} to force the US Navy into a showdown to eliminate the American carrier threat. He decided to invade and occupy Midway Atoll, which he was sure would draw out the American carriers to <b>defend</b> <b>it.</b> The Japanese codenamed the Midway invasion Operation MI. Unknown to the Japanese, the US Navy had divined the Japanese plan by breaking its JN-25 code and had prepared an ambush using its three available carriers, positioned northeast of Midway.|$|E

5|$|During {{the reign}} of Honoré I the {{internal}} transformation from fortress to palace was continued. The Treaty of Trodesillas {{at the beginning of}} Honoré's rule clarified Monaco's position as a protectorate of Spain, and thus later of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. This provided the security to allow the Lord of Monaco to concentrate on the more comfortable side of his residence rather than the constant need to <b>defend</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|In December 1952, Kurosawa {{took his}} Ikiru screenwriters, Shinobu Hashimoto and Hideo Oguni, for a forty-five-day secluded {{residence}} at an inn {{to create the}} screenplay for his next movie, Seven Samurai. The ensemble work was Kurosawa's first proper samurai film, the genre for which he would become most famous. The simple story, about a poor farming village in Sengoku period Japan that hires a group of samurai to <b>defend</b> <b>it</b> against an impending attack by bandits, was given a full epic treatment, with a huge cast (largely consisting of veterans of previous Kurosawa productions) and meticulously detailed action, stretching out to almost three-and-a-half hours of screen time.|$|E
5|$|In a 1649 treaty the Dutch had {{pledged to}} defend Denmark against unprovoked aggression, {{and from a}} Swedish point of view it was {{essential}} to establish naval supremacy in Øresund to keep the Dutch out should they decide {{to intervene in the}} conflict. Kronborg Castle sat near the narrowest part of Øresund, a sound only four kilometres wide, which gave the castle a supreme strategic importance. Frederick III had appointed the colonel Poul Beenfeldt commander of the castle and ordered him to <b>defend</b> <b>it</b> at all costs. Should he fail in that, Kronborg was to be blown up to prevent the Swedes from using it.|$|E

5|$|Odense {{is one of}} Denmark's oldest cities. Archaeological {{excavations}} in {{the vicinity}} show proof of settlement for over 4,000 years {{since at least the}} Stone Age. The earliest community was centred on the higher ground between the Odense River to the south and Naesbyhoved Lake (now dry) to the north. Nonnebakken, one of Denmark's former Viking ring fortresses, lay to the south of the river. Today, Odense's Møntergården Museum has many artefacts related to the early Viking history in the Odense area. The Vikings built numerous fortifications along the river banks to <b>defend</b> <b>it</b> against invaders coming in from the coast.|$|E
5|$|On 12 June the {{soldiers}} of the 9th Infantry Division, who had come ashore the previous day, readied themselves for {{an attack on the}} battery. At 8:30a.m., the men of the 2nd Battalion of the 39th Infantry Regiment started their attack but found only an empty battery. The fighting over the battery took a heavy toll on both sides, 307 German soldiers died to <b>defend</b> <b>it</b> and about as many Americans died to take it.|$|E
5|$|On 4 January, several incidents, {{including}} a couple exchanges of gunfire, {{suggested that the}} embassy's security detail was insufficient to hold off armed Somalis until the USS Guam and USS Trenton arrived with their helicopters and soldiers, at that time scheduled to arrive on 7 January. The embassy had just six Marine guards, whose job was limited to protecting the chancery. Ambassador Bishop made an urgent request to Washington for two platoons of soldiers to parachute into the embassy to <b>defend</b> <b>it</b> until the ships arrived. The request was denied, but the Ambassador was told that an advance element from the vessels would reach the embassy the following morning.|$|E

5|$|The Croatian {{government}} attacked JNA garrisons {{and arms}} depots {{throughout the country}} on 14 September– an offensive dubbed the Battle of the Barracks. Vukovar's JNA barracks {{was one of those}} attacked that day, but the JNA managed to <b>defend</b> <b>it.</b> In retaliation, Serb paramilitaries attacked areas to the southwest of Vukovar from the direction of Negoslavci, forcing about 2,000 people to flee. There were reports of mass killings and scores of civilian deaths. Croatian forces outside the Vukovar perimeter received large quantities of arms and ammunition from depots captured elsewhere, enabling them to hold the line against JNA attacks.|$|E
5|$|The Scilly Isles {{supported}} Charles I {{during the}} English Civil War, {{and after a}} short period in Parliamentary control rebelled in favour of Charles in 1648. The Royalists on Tresco appeared to have believed that King Charles's Castle was a critical defensive point {{on the island and}} probably built new earthwork defences around the castle to <b>defend</b> <b>it</b> against an attack from the land. It is possible, however, that these defences instead date from around 1627, and were built by the King's engineer, Bernard Johnson. During this period the castle was given its current name.|$|E
5|$|The player {{constructs}} {{and manages}} a dungeon, recruiting and catering for minions {{to run it}} and <b>defend</b> <b>it</b> from enemy invaders. The primary method of control is the hand, used to pick up creatures and objects in the dungeon, carry them around, and drop them. The hand allows the player to 'slap' creatures and objects, and interact with them. Dungeon Keeper gameplay exemplifies a dark sense of humour.|$|E

5|$|After Soviet units {{completed}} the {{operation in the}} towns, they ordered a full-scale deportation of all resident Armenians in the two towns, helicoptering them to Nagorno-Karabakh's capital, Stepanakert, and later to Armenia proper. Supplanting the previous occupants were Azerbaijani refugees who had fled from Armenia to Azerbaijan during the previous three years of fighting. Initial public outcry denounced the launching of the operation as the Soviet and Azerbaijani governments went on to <b>defend</b> <b>it,</b> stating that the villagers of Shahumyan were providing aid and harboring the militias in their homes. The Armenian government, along with the Soviet media, including Pravda and the Moskovskiye Novosti, condemned the operation and described the acts of violence {{carried out by the}} army and OMON as excessive and unnecessary; the operation continued until the first week of May.|$|E
5|$|After the German {{invasion}} of the Netherlands in 1940, {{the government of the}} Indies began preparing for a possible Japanese invasion. In Langkat, a Home Guard, or Stadswacht, division was established to defend Tanjung Pura, in Langkat. Amir and his cousin Tengku Harun were in charge; the nobility, trusted by the general populace, was selected to ensure easier recruitment of commoners. When the invasion became a reality in early 1942, Amir was one of the soldiers sent to Medan to <b>defend</b> <b>it.</b> He and the other Dutch-allied forces were quickly captured by the Japanese. He was held as a prisoner of war until 1943, when influence from the Sultan allowed him to be released. Throughout the remainder of the occupation, which lasted until 1945, Amir was employed as a radio commentator and censor in Medan. In his position as prince, he was tasked with helping to collect rice to feed the Japanese occupation army.|$|E
5|$|At around 1:30a.m. on Monday, 10 February 1930, {{approximately}} 50 troops {{belonging to}} the Second Battalion of the Fourth Regiment of Tonkinese Rifles (Régiment de Tirailleurs Tonkinois), stationed at Yên Bái, reinforced by around 60 civilian members of the VNQDĐ, attacked their 29 French officers and warrant officers. The plan was for the rebels to split into three groups. One group was to infiltrate the infantry barracks, kill French NCOs in their beds and raise support amongst the Vietnamese troops; a second, which was to include the external VNQDD members, was to fight {{its way into the}} post headquarters, while the third group would enter the officers' quarters. The longer term goal was to capture the barracks, secure the city, set up anti-aircraft guns in the hills and create a strong point around the railway station. They were to dig trenches around it to <b>defend</b> <b>it</b> from incoming colonial forces.|$|E
