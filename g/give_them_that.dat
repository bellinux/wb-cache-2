500|$|However, {{before their}} visits to United States in 1964 the Beatles still doubted {{that they could}} bring {{anything}} new to the country. In apprehensive conversation among the Beatles on board the aircraft to New York February 1964, McCartney had questioned, [...] "They've got their own groups. What {{are we going to}} <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> they don't already have?" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{complete}} {{report of}} the inquiry was released in October, preceded by a summary of findings issued on 14September 1945. Judge Barry vindicated Arthur's [...] "balance sheet" [...] and the stand taken by the pilots, finding that their motives in tendering their resignations were sincere. No further action was taken against them over the [...] "mutiny" [...] itself, but Caldwell and Gibbes were court-martialled for their involvement in the alcohol racket and reduced {{to the rank of}} flight lieutenant. Barry found that Cobby had [...] "failed to maintain proper control over his command". Cobby defended his leadership of No.1 TAF, contending that although there was [...] "some discontent", it was [...] "a healthy sign of discontent amongst certain officers who wished to do more in the war than they were doing. Unfortunately, it was not within the power of 1stT.A.F. to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> more important or more interesting work..." [...] The incident did not change the RAAF's role in the dying days of the war in the Pacific and may have hindered No.1 TAF's preparations for the upcoming Battle of Tarakan. It did improve the situation on Morotai, as Air Commodore Scherger successfully restored morale. The [...] "mutineers" [...] considered that they had achieved most of their goals by effecting a change of command in No.1 TAF and instigating a governmental inquiry.|$|E
500|$|Bostock held Cobby {{responsible}} for the [...] "dangerously low level" [...] of morale in 1st TAF, but also noted [...] "it is clear {{that he has been}} badly served by his senior staff". In the event, Jones transferred not only Cobby but also his staff officers, Group Captains Gibson and Simms, and Air Commodore Frederick Scherger took over command on 10May. Cobby's departure was greeted with relief by Australian Army commanders, who were frustrated by the poor working relationship between 1st TAF and the Army units at Tarakan. Cobby defended his leadership of 1st TAF at the subsequent inquiry before Judge John Vincent Barry. During his testimony he declared that while his officers [...] "wished to do more in the war than they were doing... it was not within the power of 1st T.A.F. to <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> more important or more interesting work". He believed that his forces had played a significant part in making safe General MacArthur's flank during the Philippines Campaign. [...] Barry nevertheless found that Cobby had [...] "failed to maintain proper control over his command", and that his removal as 1st TAF commander was justified. Air Force historian Alan Stephens later described it as [...] "a personal and institutional tragedy that a genuinely great figure in RAAF history had to end his career in such circumstances". Similarly, The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History contends that Cobby's [...] "gallant service flying career... became another victim of the weaknesses and feuding within the RAAF's senior leadership during the Pacific War". Stephens summed up Cobby's military career by saying [...] "No Australian airman's experience better illustrates the tensions between 'command', 'leadership' and 'heroism'", concluding that [...] "the qualities that make a hero do not easily translate into those needed by a commander, although they are likely to engender leadership".|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} create the Night King, {{according}} to Barrie Gower, it is primarily practical prosthetic, but also incorporates some VFX {{to create a more}} icy look and feel, saying about the eyes, [...] "The effects department alters the eyes in post-production. They <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> blue-glowy hue to them, which we can't really achieve with contact lenses." [...] In regards to the overall prosthetic, [...] "they've added this sort of icy layer over the top of him to create this — it's something incredibly difficult to achieve practically, prosthetics are cast in a translucent rubber, which can only give you so much of that icy quality, so visual effects help augment it a little bit further to give it more dimension." [...] Prior to the sixth season, the Night King was portrayed by Richard Brake, with a head mold of Brake being created in order to accurately mold the prosthetic to his face. In the sixth season he was portrayed by Vladimir Furdik. The White Walker army was first shot in front of a green screen in Magheramorne quarry, and according to a piece in The Hollywood Reporter [...] "A scan was taken from a drone and used as the basis for a CG model of the location, which was augmented with VFX and joined with volcanic hills that were photographed in Iceland." [...] Crowd replication was used to create the 1,000-man army, with special effects supervisor Joe Bauer saying [...] "It's scans of those actors in the makeup and costumes, with variations we used to make a digital army that extends up onto the hills." [...] Bauer also noted that VFX were used to create the weather conditions in the scene, noting [...] "It's wind, mist, fog and heavy atmosphere that you'd get in a marine layer. The dramatic value is to say something's wrong; it's a mystery what they are facing. The temperature drops, and our characters can see their breath. The weather obscures their vision." [...] Spain-based El Ranchito, one of several special effects companies used by Game of Thrones, was responsible for the White Walker army shots.|$|E

When Jacob's death drew near, he called his son Joseph {{and asked him to}} put his hand under Jacob's thigh and swear not to bury him in Egypt, but to bury him with his father and grandfather. Joseph agreed, but Jacob insisted that he swear to, and so he did, and Jacob bowed. Later, when one told Joseph that his father was sick, Joseph took his sons Manasseh and Ephraim to see him. Jacob sat up and told Joseph that God {{appeared}} to him at Luz, blessed him, and told him that God would multiply his descendants and <b>give</b> <b>them</b> <b>that</b> land forever. Jacob adopted Joseph's sons as his own and granted them inheritance with his own sons. Jacob recalled how when he came from Paddan, Rachel died on the way, and he buried her on the way to Ephrath, near Bethlehem. Jacob saw Joseph's sons and asked who they were, and Joseph told him that they were the sons whom God had given him in Egypt, so Jacob asked Joseph to bring them near so that he might bless them.
