5|$|Commentators noted McCotter's lack of name {{recognition}} hindered his chances for nomination. When included in Republican presidential preference polls, he regularly received {{less than one}} percent support. Following a last place finish in the Ames Straw Poll and the lack of any invitation to presidential debates, he <b>dropped</b> <b>his</b> candidacy on September 22, 2011, and endorsed Mitt Romney. Thereafter, McCotter reportedly wrote a television pilot, which was released to the media prior to his resignation from Congress in July 2012 amid a fraud investigation surrounding his congressional re-election campaign.|$|E

On August 16, 2008, the International Olympic Committee decided to strip him of his medal because they felt it amounted to a political demonstration and was disrespectful to other athletes.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, Governor Christine Todd Whitman {{approved}} the project, and construction began on November 4, 1998. After {{construction on the}} freeway began, Wynn's interests were purchased by MGM Grand Inc., thus creating the MGM Mirage company, and plans for Le Jardin were canceled. Despite the fact that Le Jardin was canceled and MGM Mirage's new casino, Borgata, was not scheduled to open until 2003, Trump still fought against the project's plans to build the exit directly to the new casino. Eventually, in January 2000, Trump <b>dropped</b> <b>his</b> case after an exit ramp leading to the Trump Marina {{was added to the}} project.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, Gomez {{suffered}} a controversial loss to Peter McDonagh when, {{in the middle}} of a round, he <b>dropped</b> <b>his</b> guard and walked out of the ring, later saying he had retired from boxing. He returned to the ring after a 15-month interval. On 21 June 2008, Gomez lost what was seen as possibly his last bout: a last chance saloon opportunity to resurrect his career against rising star and Olympic silver medallist Amir Khan. Although scoring a surprise knockdown against Khan early on, the fight ended with Gomez being stopped in five rounds.|$|E

5|$|After {{starting}} off the Canadian Open of Curling with a 4–1 win-loss record, Martin <b>dropped</b> <b>his</b> quarterfinals game against Brad Gushue {{in the final}} end of the game. Martin also posted a strong start at the next Grand Slam, The National, but lost to Glenn Howard in the quarterfinals. On April 18, 2014, amidst rumours of his front end, Marc Kennedy and Ben Hebert, joining provincial rival Kevin Koe in the next season, Martin announced his retirement from curling following {{the conclusion of the}} 2014 Players' Championship. At the last tournament of his career, Martin posted a 3–2 win-loss record in the round robin, and advanced to the playoffs. He edged John Epping and Mike McEwen en route to the final, where he recorded a 4–3 win over Brad Jacobs while curling at 98%. He capped his career with an eighteenth Grand Slam title, his eighth at the Players' Championship.|$|E

5|$|He {{continued}} to dominate sumo in 2005, {{becoming the first}} wrestler ever to win all six honbasho (sumo tournaments) in the same year. The great yokozuna Taihō achieved the feat of six consecutive tournament victories twice, but never in a calendar year. Asashōryū lost only six bouts all year (0–1–0–2–2–1). One of those rare losses came on 11 September 2005, {{at the start of}} the Aki Basho when he <b>dropped</b> <b>his</b> first Shonichi (Day 1) bout during his tenure as yokozuna. On 26 November 2005, a visibly emotional Asashōryū wept after winning his eighty-third bout of the year, (surpassing Kitanoumi's record set in 1978) and clinching the tournament at the same time. The six championships of 2005 (including two more 15–0 wins in January and May) combined with his victory from the final tournament of 2004, meant Asashōryū became the first man in sumo history to win seven consecutive tournament championships.|$|E
5|$|He next {{headed to}} Melbourne for the 2014 Australian Open, where {{he drew the}} world No. 112, Go Soeda of Japan. Despite worries {{that he was not}} match-fit, Murray got off to a strong start, {{dispatching}} the Japanese number 2 in under 90 minutes, losing just 5 games in the process. He next went on to defeat Vincent Millot and Feliciano López respectively in straight sets. In the fourth round, Murray <b>dropped</b> <b>his</b> first set of the tournament on his way to beating Stephane Robert in four sets to set up a meeting with long-standing rival Roger Federer in the quarterfinals. Despite saving two match points to take the third set, he ultimately went out in four, ending his streak of four consecutive Australian Open semifinals. As a result of losing before the final, Murray fell to No. 6 in the world, falling out of the top 5 {{for the first time since}} 2008.|$|E

He entered the Virginia Military Institute, graduating in 1933, and then Harvard Law School, from which he graduated in June 1936.

5|$|Maxwell reluctantly <b>dropped</b> <b>his</b> {{amalgamation}} plans, but retained his 19% {{stake in}} Reading. Under Smee's chairmanship, the team won promotion {{back from the}} Fourth Division {{at the end of}} the 1983–84 season, and won the Third Division title two years later, taking it into the Second Division. Smee remained at the helm until 1990, when amid a financial crisis at the club he sold it to John Madejski. Meanwhile, Maxwell made Oxford United profitable, and oversaw two successive promotions for the club during the 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons. The team played in the First Division, then the top level of English football, for the first time during 1985–86, and won its first major trophy, the League Cup, in April 1986. Despite Maxwell's reservations about the Manor Ground, the club remained there throughout this time.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the best}} known of these tells of a {{stranger}} who arrived at the club on a stormy night. Invited in, he joined the members in a card game. One player <b>dropped</b> <b>his</b> card on the floor and when he bent under the table to retrieve it noticed that the stranger had a cloven hoof. At this point the visitor disappeared in a ball of flame. This story, which is found in texts from at least the 1930s, is very similar to one associated with Loftus Hall, County Wexford. The Loftus family owned a hunting lodge – known as Dolly Mount – which was also to be found on Mount Pelier Hill.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 primary was {{so close}} it forced a recount and {{prompted}} a lawsuit. When Ohio Secretary of State Bob Taft dismissed Miller's charges of voting irregularities in Highland, Hocking and Warren counties, Miller filed suit in the Ohio Supreme Court. Miller <b>dropped</b> <b>his</b> court challenge in August and then only because his campaign treasury was exhausted. In the final count, McEwen won 33,219 votes to Miller's 32,922, a plurality of 297 votes. In the end, McEwen's geographic advantage (he retained 59% of his old territory) put him over the top. Ominously, however, Miller trounced him in the five counties {{that had been in}} Miller's old district.|$|E

It contained a rectangular, three-coil magnet with a horizontal field in which the calutron tanks could stand side by side, with four vacuum tanks, each with a double source. At the 25 June 1942 meeting of the S-1 Executive Committee, which had superseded the S-1 Uranium Committee on 19 June, there was a proposal to build the electromagnetic plant at Oak Ridge, where the other Manhattan Project facilities would be located, for reasons of economy and security. Lawrence lodged an objection due to his desire to have the electromagnetic separation plant located much nearer to Berkeley. The Shasta Dam area in California remained under consideration for the electromagnetic plant until September 1942, by which time Lawrence had <b>dropped</b> <b>his</b> objection. The 25 June meeting also designated Stone & Webster as the primary contractor for the design and engineering.|$|E
5|$|The {{level of}} {{security}} imposed on the planning for the raid was so high that when Major Frost was first briefed by a liaison officer from the headquarters of 1st Airborne Division, he was informed that his company was {{to take part in}} an airborne warfare demonstration for the War Cabinet. He was also informed that C Company would be divided into four sections for the exercise, which was contrary to a plan Frost had devised for the exercise and confused him. It was only after Frost raised several objections with a more senior officer at headquarters that he was informed of the intended raid, after which the Major <b>dropped</b> <b>his</b> objections and turned his attention to training the company.|$|E

In February, Thorpe qualified for the 2006 Commonwealth Games by winning the 100m and 200m freestyle in times of 49.24s and 1min 46.42s respectively. He expressed disappointment with his performances; he speculated that he may have misjudged his new training schedule and anticipated further improvement.|$|E
