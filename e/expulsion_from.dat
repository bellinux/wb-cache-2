5|$|After {{the article}} was published, over one hundred {{prominent}} intellectuals, {{including some of the}} people Szabó had denounced, published a letter of support for him.

He also worked in a coal pit at Clayton-le-Moors. He died on 26 September 1903 in Blackburn. His burial was paid for by Lancashire County Cricket Club.

5|$|Echmarcach {{appears to}} have forged an {{alliance}} with the powerful Uí Briain. A leading member of this kindred, Donnchad mac Briain, King of Munster, was married to Cacht ingen Ragnaill, {{a woman who could}} have been closely related to Echmarcach. Certainly, Echmarcach's daughter, Mór, married one of Donnchad's Uí Briain close kinsmen. Echmarcach's violent career brought him into bitter conflict with a particular branch of the Uí Ímair who had held Dublin periodically from the early eleventh century. This branch was supported by the rising Uí Cheinnselaig, an Irish kindred responsible for Echmarcach's final <b>expulsion</b> <b>from</b> Dublin and apparently Mann as well.|$|E
5|$|Hervey le Breton (also {{known as}} Hervé le Breton; died 30 August 1131) was a Breton cleric who became Bishop of Bangor in Wales and later Bishop of Ely in England. Appointed to Bangor by King William II of England, when the Normans were {{advancing}} into Wales, Hervey {{was unable to}} remain in his diocese when the Welsh began to drive the Normans back from their recent conquests. Hervey's behaviour towards the Welsh seems to have contributed to his <b>expulsion</b> <b>from</b> his see. Although the new king, Henry I wished to translate Hervey to the see of Lisieux in Normandy, it was unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|In 1244, Alexander {{made the}} first of several {{attempts}} by Scottish monarchs to purchase the Hebrides from the Kingdom of Norway. It was following this unsuccessful bid that Hákon sent Eóghan into the Isles in 1249, which in turn led to Eóghan's <b>expulsion</b> <b>from</b> the Scottish-mainland when Alexander launched a full-scale summer invasion into Argyll. Alexander's sudden death in the Hebrides brought an abrupt end to his westward invasion, and {{it was not until the}} 1260s that a Scottish king again attempted to impose his authority into the Isles.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode is}} {{read in a}} radically {{different}} way by Walter Goffart. According to him, the whole story assumes an allegorical meaning, with Paul intent on telling an edifying story of {{the downfall of the}} hero and his <b>expulsion</b> <b>from</b> the promised land, because of his human weakness. In this story, the skull cup plays a key role as it unites original sin and barbarism. Goffart does not exclude the possibility that Paul had really seen the skull, but believes that by the 740s the connection between sin and barbarism as exemplified by the skull cup had already been established.|$|E
5|$|After {{just half}} a year as vice president, Arthur {{found himself in the}} {{executive}} mansion due to the assassination of his predecessor. To the surprise of reformers, Arthur took up the cause of reform, though it had once led to his <b>expulsion</b> <b>from</b> office. He signed the Pendleton Act into law and strongly enforced its provisions. He gained praise for his veto of a Rivers and Harbors Act that would have appropriated federal funds in a manner he thought excessive. He presided over the rebirth of the United States Navy, but was criticized for failing to alleviate the federal budget surplus, which had been accumulating {{since the end of the}} Civil War.|$|E
