500|$|Marceline is {{voiced by}} Olivia Olson; she had {{originally}} auditioned {{for the role}} of Princess Bubblegum. After her initial audition, she was asked to read {{for the role of}} Marcelline, and was [...] "definitely impressed by the character" [...] after seeing design drawings. Olson is also the character's singing voice. The artistic design for Marceline was created by Ward, with small changes and additions added by Phil Rynda, former lead character designer and prop designer for Adventure Time. Olson later related in an interview that she was impressed by her character because, [...] "she has really cool style [...] <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>what</b> they come up with [...] every episode." [...] The episode also features the vocal talents of actor Erik Estrada as King Worm; Estrada would reprise the role for the eponymous fourth season episode [...] "King Worm".|$|E
500|$|... "Jump" [...] is {{the overall}} seventh and final single off Unapologetic. It {{was written by}} Kevin Cossom and M. B. Williams {{together}} with its producers StarGate (Mikkel S. Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen) and Chase & Status (Saul Milton and Will Kennard). The song samples elements of [...] "Pony" [...] (1996), as performed by Ginuwine and written by Elgin [...] "Ginuwine" [...] Lumpkin, Stephen Garrett and Timothy [...] "Timbaland" [...] Mosley. In an interview with MTV News Ginuwine stated: [...] "You know what? My management told me she wanted to use it, and Rihanna, I'm a fan of hers and <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>what</b> she's doing. You got to embrace it! You can't be a stickler... especially when an artist like Rihanna wants to use it". He further {{said that he is}} anxious to hear what the singer has done with the sample and hopes that it will do a good job for her, just as it did for him.|$|E
500|$|A Cajun mutant thief who has {{the ability}} to convert the {{potential}} energy of any object he touches into kinetic energy, forcing it to explode. The size of the object determines the magnitude of the resulting explosion. He is also skilled in the use of a staff, and happens to be very agile. Due to the nature of his power, he displays supernatural durability, being able to take Wolverine's elbow to his face and return to fight moments later. When asked about his thoughts on the character, Kitsch had said, [...] "I knew of him, but I didn't know the following he had. I'm sure I'm still going to be exposed to that. I love the character, I love the powers, and <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>what</b> they did with him. I didn't know that much, but in my experience, it was a blessing to go in and create my take on him. I'm excited for it, to say the least." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{design for}} Marceline {{was created by}} Ward, with small changes and {{additions}} added by Phil Rynda, former lead character and prop designer for Adventure Time. Visually, Marceline has long, dark hair. She rarely walks on the ground, generally preferring to float when she travels, moves, and sleeps. Marceline, unlike {{many of the other}} characters, wears varying outfits in most of her appearances. According to Ward, her clothing changes from episode to episode because [...] "girls own more than one outfit". Olson was impressed by her character's fashion design stating, [...] "she has really cool style [...] <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>what</b> they come up with [...] every episode." [...] Olson explained that when she goes in to record the voices for each episode, she is [...] "totally surprised" [...] by the costuming for Marceline. While she says her lines, she is able to view the animatics for the episode and sometimes has to stop to admire the unique designs. Marceline's physical size and shape slightly changes depending on who is drawing her. Rynda later called this [...] "one of the coolest parts" [...] about the character's animation {{due to the fact that}} [...] "every artist leaves a little bit of their own taste and sensibilities in what they draw." ...|$|E
500|$|On 14 October 2005 Eon Productions, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Sony Pictures Entertainment {{announced}} {{at a press}} conference in London that Daniel Craig would be the sixth actor to portray Bond in the Eon series (although seventh film Bond overall). A tuxedo- and lifejacket-clad Craig arrived via a Royal Navy speedboat. Craig had based his acceptance of the role on the strength of the script for the first film, Casino Royale; he later recalled that [...] "once I sat down and read the story, I just thought that I wanted to tell ... I'm a big Bond fan, and <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>what</b> he represents". Significant controversy followed the decision, with some critics and fans expressing doubt the producers had made the right choice. Throughout the entire production period, Internet campaigns such as danielcraigisnotbond.com expressed their dissatisfaction and threatened to boycott the film in protest. Craig, unlike previous actors, was not considered by the protesters to fit the tall, dark, handsome and charismatic image of Bond to which viewers had been accustomed. Many disparagingly called him [...] "James Blonde", believing the [...] blond-haired blue-eyed rugged Craig to be far fitting from the traditional tall, dark and suave actors who had earlier portrayed him. The Daily Mirror ran a front-page news story critical of Craig, with the headline, The Name's Bland – James Bland.|$|E
500|$|Pete Rock said of {{his studio}} {{experience}} with West, [...] "He's definitely hip-hop, his roots, I was testing him on joints...He takes it to another level which is dope. He had these musicians and this song, they played around my little raggedy beat and made it real. I love the way he works — he goes from one room, writing rhymes then goes to another beat and goes to another room and does something else — <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>what</b> he's done". Rapper Pusha T characterized the album as [...] "a collage of sounds" [...] and found West's methods unorthodox when recording, saying that [...] "We could easily be working on one song, thinking we're in a mode, and he'll hear a sound from someone like [...] Jeff Bhasker and immediately turn his whole attention to that sound and go through his mental Rolodex to where that sound belongs on his album, and then it goes straight to that song, immediately". DJ Premier said of the production in comparison to West's previous work, [...] "Well, first of all, {{if you look at}} all of Kanye West's output, he actually did a lot to bring back sampling and make it cool again, even though he's more of a mainstream artist...but his new album is strictly hard beats and rhyme. He's totally done with electro. You're gonna be surprised what you hear".|$|E

[...] When asked why he risks his life on the high-wire, he replied [...] "I do this because <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>what</b> I do... If I won the lottery tomorrow, I'd still be doing what I do." [...] "Walking the wire to me is life," [...] he adds. [...] Wallenda and his family spend roughly 48 weeks per year on the road.|$|E

In a 2008 interview with Walt Mossberg, Murdoch was asked whether he had [...] "anything {{to do with the}} New York Posts endorsement of Barack Obama in the democratic primaries." [...] Without hesitating, Murdoch replied, [...] "Yeah. He is a rock star. It's fantastic. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>what</b> he is saying about education.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to Sabrina, Givenchy designed her costumes for Love in the Afternoon (1957), Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), Funny Face (1957), Charade (1963), Paris When It Sizzles (1964) and How to Steal a Million (1966), {{as well as}} clothed her off screen. According to Moseley, fashion plays an unusually central role in many of Hepburn's films, stating that [...] "the costume is not tied to the character, functioning 'silently' in the mise-en-scène, but as 'fashion' becomes an attraction in the aesthetic in its own right". Hepburn herself stated that Givenchy [...] "gave me a look, a kind, a silhouette. He {{has always been the}} best and he stayed the best. Because he kept the spare style that <b>I</b> <b>love.</b> <b>What</b> is more beautiful than a simple sheath made an extraordinary way in a special fabric, and just two earrings?" [...] She also became the face of Givenchy's first perfume, L'Interdit, in 1957. In {{addition to}} her partnership with Givenchy, Hepburn was credited with boosting the sales of Burberry trench coats when she wore one in Breakfast at Tiffany's, and was associated with Italian footwear brand Tod's.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2011, TobyMac {{stated that}} a reunion tour would {{probably}} happen [...] "sooner or later". He mentioned talking with Michael and Kevin about [...] "when it should be" [...] and [...] "what it could look like." [...] Fans {{hoping for a}} reunion tour {{in the near future}} may be disappointed: [...] "Right now, I think we're really just enjoying the mountain we're climbing, each of us individually. It's never been a completely closed door. We've always sort of laughed about it, smiled about it. It's timing, I guess." [...] On May 28 and 29, 2011, at the Big Church Day Out in Wiston, UK, TobyMac joined the Newsboys twice to perform [...] "Jesus Freak", and Michael sang [...] "In the Light" [...] on both days with Toby's band, Diverse City. In June 2011 Toby admitted that he thought about Kevin and Michael for every song that he writes. His song [...] "Wonderin'" [...] is about his past with Kevin and Michael in DC Talk. [...] "It's just a warm look back at DC Talk," [...] says Toby, almost wistfully. [...] "It's reminiscing about Michael and Kevin and what we did together, and recognizing their influence on me. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>what</b> I do today, but there are times when I wonder, What if we stayed together? I've got these dreams I'm pursuing now, but are they stealing me from you?" [...] On June 7, 2011, Back 2 Back Hits, featuring songs off Jesus Freak and Supernatural, was released.|$|E

60|$|But to {{conclude}} this, when {{we attempt to}} force our brother beyond his light, or to break his heart with grief; to thrust him beyond his faith, or to bar him from his privilege: how can we say, <b>I</b> <b>love?</b> <b>What</b> shall I say? To have fellowship one with another {{for the sake of}} an outward circumstance, or to make that the door to fellowship which God hath not; yea to make that the including, excluding charter; the bounds, bar, and rule of communion; when by the word of the everlasting testament there is no warrant for it; to speak charitably, if it be not for want of love, it is for want of knowledge in the mysteries of the kingdom of Christ. Strange! take two Christians equal in all points but this, nay, let one go beyond the other far, for grace and holiness; yet this circumstance of water shall drown and sweep away all his excellencies, not counting him worthy of that reception, that with hand and heart shall be given to a novice in religion, because he consents to water.|$|E

60|$|And so {{all this}} superstition {{has had the}} same effect as the false preaching in Ezekiel's time had. It has {{strengthened}} {{the hands of the}} wicked, that he should not turn from his wicked way, by promising him life; and it has made the heart of the righteous sad, whom God has not made sad. Plain, respectable, God-fearing men and women, who have wished simply to do their duty where God has put them, have been told that they are still unconverted, still carnal-- that they have no share in Christ--that God's Spirit is not with them--that they are in the way to endless torture: till they have been ready one minute to say, 'Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die'--'Surely I have cleansed my hands in vain, and washed my heart in innocency;' and the next minute to say, with Job, angrily, 'Though I die, thou shalt not take my righteousness from me! You preachers may call me what names you will; but I know that <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>what</b> is right, and wish to do my duty;' and so they have been made perplexed and unhappy, one day fancying themselves worse than they really were, and the next fancying themselves better than they really were; and by both tempers of mind tempted to disbelieve God's Gospel, and throw away the thought of vital religion in disgust.|$|E

When you are there with me, dear one, then I shall speak to you in the language of my ancestors, which some day you will understand, and you shall know that love has its cradle in the East, you shall feel the flame of its birth, the furnace of its accomplishment. Here my tongue moves slowly, yet I stoop my knee to you, I show you my heart, and my lips tell you that <b>I</b> <b>love.</b> <b>What</b> that love is you shall learn some day, if you have the will and the confidence and the soul.
