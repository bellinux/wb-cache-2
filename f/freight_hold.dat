25|$|The G 31 was {{the first}} Luft Hansa {{airliner}} to feature a flight attendant (Wagner p.264), who served food and drinks (which were not complimentary). This earned the G 31 the nickname 'flying dining car' ('fliegender Speisewagen' in German). Because of its large fuselage it was also called the flying moving van ('fliegender Möbelwagen' in German). Behind the cockpit were compartments for a radio operator, baggage and an APU that provided compressed air for main engine starting and drove a generator for electric power. The cabin was divided into three compartments that held eleven regular passenger seats, four jumpseats for passengers, a jumpseat for the steward, and an enclosed lavatory. Instead of the passenger seats, ten beds could be made up for night flying. There was a baggage and <b>freight</b> <b>hold</b> under the cabin. The wings had trailing edge flaps that reduced the landing speed by ten percent (Wagner p.267).|$|E

50|$|The Il-62 is a {{conventional}} all-metal low-wing monoplane of riveted sectional semi-monocoque construction to fail-safe design principles (a structure {{designed so that}} failure of one major member does not cause immediate failure of the whole). Its service life was initially set at 30,000 flight hours and subject to extensions and curtailments according {{to the quality of}} service procedures, inspection and manufacturer's bulletins. The aircraft features pressurised cabin and <b>freight</b> <b>holds</b> (with fuselage dimensions of 3.8 m width x 4.1 m height), duplex all-mechanical flight controls, though with twin electric motors for tailplane incidence control; hydraulic nosewheel steering, landing gear and tail strut actuation, and wheel brakes. The Il-62M has spoilers and lift dumpers which extend automatically upon landing and are hydraulically operated. Control surfaces include a variable-incidence tailplane with dynamically and weight-compensated elevators with trim tabs, triple-section tabbed ailerons (outermost for low speed and innermost for high speed) which are interlinked with a torsion bar, spoilerons (Il-62M), spoilers and lift dumpers, and pneumatically actuated thrust reversers on the two outboard engines (the reversers are flight-rated on the Il-62M).|$|R

50|$|The {{prototype}} C.61 (F-ESAE) had a <b>freight</b> <b>hold</b> and cabin for six passengers. The conventional {{landing gear}} also included a wheel beneath the nose to prevent nose-overs on landing. For the production C.61s the cabin size was increased to accommodate eight passengers.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the increased fuel load of the late model Il-76, the Il-78 has two removable 18,230-litre fuel tanks installed in the <b>freight</b> <b>hold,</b> giving transferable loads of 85,720 kg (with hold tanks) or 57,720 kg (without). Controlled from the gunner station, which is stripped of military equipment, three aircraft can refuel in flight simultaneously from the UPAZ-1A (Il-78) / UPAZ-1M (IL-78M) 26m refuelling pods fitted to the outer wings and rear fuselage. In addition, four aircraft can also be refuelled on the ground using conventional refuelling hoses extending from the <b>freight</b> <b>hold.</b> Because of the aircraft's high all-up weight after takeoff, which in an emergency would mean landing at weights well in excess of maximum allowable landing weight, the Il-78 has a fuel jettison system with jettison ports at the wingtips.|$|E

5000|$|Blackburn B-107 : Projected Stage 2 {{development}} of the B-101 Beverley designed in 1956 that retained the Beverley wings and tail; and added a completely new rounded fuselage with a larger unobstructed <b>freight</b> <b>hold.</b> The intended powerplants were to be four Rolls-Royce Tyne turboprop engines. The design allowed for 75 paratroops or 108 troops to be carried. The design project never progressed beyond the planning stage.|$|E
50|$|Multiple {{derivatives}} of the Belfast were {{proposed by}} Short. Two principal civil {{versions of the}} aircraft, designated as SC5/10A and SC5/31, were mooted during the early 1960s. The SC5/10A {{was to have been}} a commercial freight derived directly from the Belfast C.1, retaining much of its design such as its large rear loading doors for access to the main <b>freight</b> <b>hold.</b> The payload was to be increased to 85,000 lb; reportedly, up to 150 passengers could be seated on a single deck while up to 288 people could be seated across a double-deck configuration.|$|E
5000|$|Soon {{after the}} Il-78 passed {{acceptance}} tests in 1984, Ilyushin {{was instructed to}} design and produce an upgraded version {{to be known as}} Il-78M. The Il-78M is a dedicated tanker and cannot be converted back to the transport role easily. Adding a third <b>freight</b> <b>hold</b> tank increased transferable fuel to 105,720 kg and maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) to 210,000 kg, necessitating reinforcement of the wing torsion box. UPAZ-1M refuelling pods improved maximum fuel flow to 2,900 l/min [...] (638 Imp gal/min). Because the Il-78M is not [...] "convertible", all cargo handling equipment was removed and cargo doors were deleted, saving approximately 5,000 kg in structural weight.|$|E

50|$|The Saunders-Roe Duchess {{also known}} as the model P.131 was a British design for a large jet-powered flying boat from Saunders-Roe, based in Cowes on the Isle of Wight. The Duchess was {{designed}} to follow the propeller-driven Princess. The Duchess would have been a high-wing cantiliver monoplane with a conventional tail and a full-length planing bottom. It also had retractable stabiliser floats at each wingtip. It was to have had a pressurised and air-conditioned cabin for 74 passengers in two compartments with a <b>freight</b> <b>hold</b> in the centre. The six de Havilland Ghost turbojets were to have been mounted inside the wing roots. The company displayed a model of the aircraft at the 1950 Farnborough Air Show. Tasman Empire Airways considered ordering the aircraft for journeys between Australia and New Zealand but the aircraft was cancelled.|$|E

30|$|The {{producers}} of the goods that determine the demand for transportation are often called shippers, while the transport companies that perform the transportation can be subsumed under carriers (Crainic and Laporte 1997). In addition to road haulers or railway operators, freight forwarders can be classified as carriers, as they not only operate in their classic role as an intermediary, but because {{they have their own}} transportation assets, they also act as both forwarders and transport haulers (Woxenius and Bärthel 2006 : 16). Moreover, to achieve competitive rates, most of the <b>freight</b> forwarders <b>hold</b> contracts with other transportation companies, making them less neutral when making decisions regarding transport modes (Vassallo et al. 2007).|$|R

50|$|The {{promotion}} of a passenger service through Denton Station seems uncertain whilst {{the future of}} freight traffic seems more assured {{as evidenced by the}} North West Rail Utilisation Strategy May 2007 of Network Rail. A more frequent service was considered for the 2008 timetable shakeup, which was designed to implement major changes to service patterns on the West Coast Main Line; however, because of the track layout and congestion at Heaton Norris, operational analysis suggests 'Timetabling the move across Heaton Norris is very likely to be problematic.

40|$|Introduction The fleet {{management}} problem, in its simplest form, involves managing fleets of equipment to meet customer requests as they evolve over time. The equipment might be containers which <b>hold</b> <b>freight</b> (ocean containers, truck trailers, boxcars), {{equipment such as}} locomotives, truck tractors, taxicabs or business jets (companies in the fractional jet ownership business may own up to 1, 000 jets). The equipment has to serve customers (people or freight) who typically want {{to move from one}} location to the next. We make the assumption throughout that a piece of equipment can serve one request at a time. One of the challenges of {{fleet management}} is that customer requests arrive randomly over time, often requiring service within a narrow interval. Since it can take from several days to over a week to move transportation equipment over long distances, {{it is not possible to}} wait until a customer request is known before moving the equipment. As a result, it is necessary to move equipme...|$|R
