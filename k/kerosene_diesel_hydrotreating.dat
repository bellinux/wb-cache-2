40|$|A multi-period {{nonlinear}} programming (NLP) formulation {{is presented in}} this paper. This is intended to optimize energy and materials simultaneously for <b>diesel</b> <b>hydrotreating</b> units {{in order to minimize}} the total costs which include product income, material cost, energy cost, and other fixed operating costs. The heat exchanger network (HEN) is integrated into the model to address the energy consumption changes with the stream flow and temperature of different production modes. Some process models are regressed from production data or are supplied by refinery engineers, similar to the models for steam turbines and compressors, and distillation towers. An iterative algorithm is developed to solve the complex mathematical model based on HEN simulation. An industrial <b>diesel</b> <b>hydrotreating</b> unit is provided by the Chinese Refinery Complex and is used to demonstrate the performance of the formulated model and algorithm. It is found that the optimized results from the simultaneous consideration of the energy and materials are more profitable than those obtained from other methods that individually optimized the energy or materials.

50|$|LTTD {{has proven}} very {{effective}} in reducing concentrations of petroleum products including gasoline, jet fuels, <b>kerosene,</b> <b>diesel</b> fuel, heating oils, and lubricating oils. LTTD is applicable to constituents that are volatile at temperatures up to 1,200 °F. Most desorbers operate at temperatures between 300 °F to 1,000 °F. Desorbers constructed of special alloys can operate at temperatures up to 1,200 °F. More volatile products (e.g. gasoline) can be desorbed at the lower operating range, while semivolatile products (e.g. <b>kerosene,</b> <b>diesel</b> fuel) generally need temperatures over 700 °F, and relatively nonvolatile products (e.g., heating oil, lubricating oils) need even higher temperatures. Essentially all soil types are amenable for treatment by LTTD systems. However, different soils may require varying degrees and types of pretreatment. For example, coarse-grained soils (e.g. gravel and cobbles) may require crushing; fine-grained soils that are excessively cohesive (e.g. clay) may require shredding.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors affecting the crack spread is the relative proportion of various petroleum products produced by a refinery. Refineries produce many products from crude oil, including gasoline, <b>kerosene,</b> <b>diesel,</b> heating oil, aviation fuel, asphalt and others. To some degree, the proportion of each product produced can be varied in order to suit the demands of the local market. Regional differences in the demand for each refined product depend upon the relative demand for fuel for heating, cooking or transportation purposes. Within a region, there can also be seasonal differences in demand for heating fuel versus transportation fuel.|$|R
50|$|Algae {{can be used}} {{to produce}} 'green diesel' (also known as {{renewable}} <b>diesel,</b> <b>hydrotreating</b> vegetable oil or hydrogen-derived renewable <b>diesel)</b> through a <b>hydrotreating</b> refinery process that breaks molecules down into shorter hydrocarbon chains used in diesel engines. It has the same chemical properties as petroleum-based diesel meaning that it does not require new engines, pipelines or infrastructure to distribute and use. It has yet to be produced at a cost that is competitive with petroleum. While hydrotreating is currently the most common pathway to produce fuel-like hydrocarbons via decarboxylation/decarbonylation, there is an alternative process offering a number of important advantages over hydrotreating. In this regard, the work of Crocker et al. and Lercher et al. is particularly noteworthy. For oil refining, research is underway for catalytic conversion of renewable fuels by decarboxylation. As the oxygen is present in crude oil at rather low levels, of the order of 0.5%, deoxygenation in petroleum refining is not of much concern, and no catalysts are specifically formulated for oxygenates hydrotreating. Hence, one of the critical technical challenges to make the hydrodeoxygenation of algae oil process economically feasible is related to the research and development of effective catalysts.|$|R
