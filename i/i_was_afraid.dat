Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. I knew that if I went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would believe that there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in a new recording studio built in a warehouse in Northridge, California, named Studio 606 West {{in contrast to the}} original Studio 606 in Grohl's basement in Alexandria, Virginia. Development for In Your Honor took nine months with three and a half months installing equipment in the studio, and songs being written throughout 2004. While waiting for 606 to get finished, the band rehearsed on North Hollywood's Mates Rehearsal Studios, where [...] "we ended up with three or four different versions of about 30 songs", according to Raskulinecz who added that [...] "it {{got to the point where}} I didn't want them to play the rock songs anymore. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> they were going to get stale." ...|$|E

500|$|Early on, {{the team}} decided {{that rather than}} rely on old Halo themes, ODST would feature all-new music. [...] "It was a bit intimidating at first," [...] Salvatori recalled, [...] "because in {{previous}} Halo games if new ideas weren't coming, I could always dust off an old one {{and give it a}} new spin. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> that we might hit some writer's block along the way, but that didn't happen at all. Instead, we had the freedom to explore some new musical territory, and the ideas flowed pretty quickly." [...] With the exception of the main player character, O'Donnell and Salvatori did not compose themes to represent characters. While the game's setting in Africa inspired some percussion pieces, the team was interested in a sparser atmosphere, which Salvatori described as [...] "a bit darker and less epic".|$|E
500|$|The plane scene {{during which}} {{passengers}} die in mid-air was created inside {{a very large}} sound stage. The three-ton hydraulic gimbal was operated automatically. [...] "We spent two months building this central set piece that weighs about 45,000 pounds and holds 89 people," [...] special effects supervisor Terry Sonderhoff explained. Used for filming the on-board sequences, it could be shifted on the gimbal to create a pitching movement of up to 45 degrees side-to-side and 60 degrees front-to-back, realistically conveying the horror of airborne engine failure. [...] Sawa said that [...] "the screams of the cast inside the gimbal made it appear more real". [...] Wong said, [...] "You walk into the studio and there's a huge gimbal with a plane on top and you think, 'What have I done?' <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> we were gonna have 40 extras vomiting." ...|$|E
500|$|Bundy {{underwent}} multiple psychiatric examinations; the experts' conclusions varied. Dorothy Otnow Lewis, Professor of Psychiatry at the New York University School of Medicine and {{an authority}} on violent behavior, initially made a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, but later changed her impression more than once. She also suggested {{the possibility of a}} multiple personality disorder, based on behaviors described in interviews and court testimony: a great-aunt witnessed an episode during which Bundy [...] "seemed to turn into another, unrecognizable person... suddenly, inexplicably found herself afraid of her favorite nephew as they waited together at a dusk-darkened train station. He had turned into a stranger." [...] Lewis recounted a prison official in Tallahassee describing a similar transformation: [...] "He said, 'He became weird on me.' He did a metamorphosis, a body and facial change, and he felt there was almost an odor emitting from him. He said, 'Almost a complete change of personality... that was the day <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of him.|$|E

500|$|During {{practice}} for the 1980 Indianapolis 500, Richmond set the fastest unofficial practice speed of the month, besting even race favorite Johnny Rutherford in the vaunted Chaparral. His hopes for the pole were dashed with a crash in morning practice {{on the first day}} of qualifying. After repairs he qualified 19th for the race. He worked his way up to the top 10 during the race, led a lap, and finished ninth as he ran out of fuel at the end of the race. To the delight of the crowd, winner Rutherford gave him a ride back to the pits. He was named the 1980 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year. [...] "I busted up a few Indy cars right after that," [...] he said. [...] "Milwaukee, Mid-Ohio... at Michigan I cut one in two. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> my racing career would come to a halt. So when I got an offer to drive stock cars, I took it, and it turned out I liked driving them better." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{description of}} carbon monoxide poisoning dates to at least 200 BC by Aristotle. Documented cases {{of carbon monoxide}} {{being used as a}} method of suicide date to at least 100 BC in ancient Rome. In the AD 350s, the Roman emperor Julian suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning in Paris, and later described it in his work Misopogon: [...] "though the winter weather prevailed and continually increased in severity, even so I did not allow my servants to heat the house, because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of drawing out the dampness in the walls; but I ordered them to carry in fire that had burned down and to place in the room a very moderate number of hot coals. But the coals, though there were not very many of them, brought out from the walls quantities of steam and this made me fall asleep. And since my head was filled with the fumes I was almost choked. Then I was carried outside." [...] This misunderstanding of the causes of carbon monoxide poisoning may have caused the death of Julian's successor, Jovian.|$|E
500|$|At the 2014 Hero Complex Film Festival, Sigourney Weaver {{hinted that}} she'd be {{interested}} in returning {{to the role of}} Ripley, stating that Resurrection's ending [...] "feels incomplete to me. I wish it didn't, but it does. We left it hanging. And there's a way to finish this story that i think would be satisfying to me and the many fans." [...] She also stated regarding the hybrid character that [...] "Had we done a fifth one, I don't doubt that her humanity would have prevailed. I do feel like there is more story to tell. I feel a longing from fans for the story to be finished. I could imagine a situation where we finish telling the story." [...] She was quoted: [...] "I don't think Alien belongs on Earth popping out of a haystack, which is where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> it was going to go. I feel it should take place in {{the far reaches of the}} universe where no one in their right mind would go.

500|$|Walker {{objected to}} Kenney's {{suggestion}} that the bombers conduct attacks from low level with bombs armed with instantaneous fuses. Kenney ordered Walker to try the instantaneous fuses {{for a couple of}} months, so that data could be gained about their effectiveness; a few weeks later Kenney discovered that Walker had discontinued the use of the instantaneous fuses. In November, Kenney arranged for a demonstration attack on the SS Pruth, a ship that had sunk off Port Moresby in 1924 and was often used for target practice. After the attack Walker and Kenney took a boat out to the wreck to inspect the damage. As expected, none of the four bombs dropped had hit the stationary wreck; but the instantaneous fuses had detonated the bombs when they struck the water, and bomb fragments had torn holes in the sides of the ship. Walker reluctantly conceded the point. [...] "Ken was okay," [...] Kenney later recalled. [...] "He was stubborn, over-sensitive, and a prima donna, but he worked like a dog all the time. His gang liked him a lot but he tended to get a staff of 'yes-men'. He did not like to delegate authority. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> that Ken was not durable enough to last very long under the high tension of this show." ...|$|E
500|$|Murphy {{became a}} {{national}} celebrity following his World War II military service when Life magazine proclaimed him America's [...] "most decorated soldier" [...] in its 16 July 1945 issue cover story. That magazine cover {{brought him to the}} attention of veteran actor James Cagney who invited him to Hollywood. When Murphy arrived in California after his military discharge, Cagney cancelled the hotel reservations he'd made for Murphy and instead took him into his own home, [...] "I got the shock of my life. Audie was very thin. His complexion was bluish-gray." [...] Commenting years later on his first impression, Cagney said, [...] " [...] in such a nervous condition that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> he might jump out of a window. I took him home and gave him my bed." [...] He spent three weeks as a guest of Cagney and then returned to Texas before finally agreeing to an offer from brothers James and William Cagney of $150 a week as a contract player with their production company. The Cagneys gave Murphy personal attention on acting techniques. He also took lessons at the Actors' Lab on Sunset Boulevard. Murphy studied voice techniques, learned judo, and trained with choreographer John Boyle, Cagney's dance coach for Yankee Doodle Dandy. A 1947 disagreement with William Cagney ended his association with the brothers without having been cast in a film production.|$|E
500|$|Chloe's first romantic {{relationship}} {{is with the}} man {{believed to be the}} millionaire son of Jill Abbott, Cane Ashby (Daniel Goddard). In July 2009, it is revealed that Cane Ashby is not the son of Jill Abbott. Hendrickson compared their relationship, which ensued as a result of Chloe practically [...] "threatening him", to the psychological thriller film Fatal Attraction (1987); [...] "I've definitely channeled my inner Glenn Close at times. But I'm trying really hard not to make Chloe go down the crazy path. I don't think she's crazy. She just desperately wants to be loved," [...] she said. While Cane is drunk, Chloe sleeps with him and becomes pregnant. Hendrickson described Chloe's actions as [...] "definitely plotting" [...] but, in reference to Chloe's backstory, said it was [...] "not because of who he is. She just wanted him". Prior to the revelation that she is Kate Valentine, Chloe marries Cane, angering the Chancellors. According to the actress, Chloe's [...] "defense" [...] is, [...] "I came here to start fresh and I wanted to do it on my own. I didn't tell Cane because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> he would think I was going after him for his money. There was no plotting." [...] Chloe disrupts the pairing of Cane and Lily Winters (Christel Khalil), creating a [...] "bitchy" [...] rivalry between the female characters. Ultimately, Chloe gives birth to a daughter named Cordelia [...] "Delia" [...] Abbott (Sophie Pollono). In a dramatic love rectangle storyline, it is revealed that Delia's father is actually Jill's son, Billy Abbott (Billy Miller); this revelation ends Chloe's manipulations of Cane, despite his excitement at the prospect of being a father.|$|E

500|$|An attorney-at-law with a {{disability}} who was blinded as a youth in an accident with bio-waste that drastically heightened his remaining senses {{and gave him a}} [...] "sonar-sense", which allowed him to perceive his surroundings, and makes a silent promise with his father to [...] "stick up for the long shots". His father is killed not long after and at that moment, he vows to seek justice. At night, he becomes a devil-modeled vigilante who takes justice into his hands. Affleck was cast in October 2001. Vin Diesel was considered to portray Daredevil before him, but he opted to take a role in another film. In a February 2011 interview, Guy Pearce said that he was offered the role but turned it down, stating that [...] "comic-strip stuff isn’t really my cup of tea, really." [...] Matt Damon also revealed that he was offered the role. [...] He claimed that he and Ben [...] "loved that comic book but I just didn't quite believe in the script or the director at the time." [...] Colin Farrell was also considered until Affleck signed. As a fan, Affleck made sure he had read every single issue of Daredevil, commenting that it was about taking what he knew as a fan and faithfully getting it on the screen. Joe Quesada considered it [...] "serendipity in action" [...] that Affleck is the lead role, as when he and Kevin Smith did the [...] series, they had modeled it on Affleck. Affleck said Daredevil was his favorite comic book as a kid, and explained why he took the role by saying [...] "Everybody has that one thing from childhood that they remember and that sticks with them. This story was that for me." [...] Additionally, he said, [...] "I didn't want someone else to do it, because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> that they would go out and do it different from the comic and screw it up." ...|$|E
