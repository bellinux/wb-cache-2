40|$|AbstractThe (in) equational {{properties}} of iteration, i. e., least (pre-) fixed point solutions over cpo's, are {{captured by the}} axioms of iteration theories. All known axiomatizations of iteration theories consist of the Conway <b>identities</b> <b>and</b> a complicated equation scheme, the commutative identity. The results of this paper show that the commutative identity is implied by the Conway <b>identities</b> <b>and</b> a weak form of the Park induction principle. Hence, we obtain a simple first order axiomatization of the (in) equational theory of iteration. It follows that a few simple <b>identities</b> <b>and</b> a weak form of the Scott induction principle, formulated to involve only inequations, are also complete. We also show that the Conway <b>identities</b> <b>and</b> the Park induction principle are not complete for the universal Horn theory of iteration...|$|R

40|$|Liberal-democratic states’ {{commitments}} to equality and personal autonomy have always proven problematic {{with respect to}} state regulation of relations between parents and children. In the parental authority literature positions have varied from invoking children’s interests to argue for limitations on parental efforts to instill <b>identities</b> <b>and</b> values to invoking parental rights to justify state privileging of such efforts. This article argues that liberal-democratic states should privilege parental efforts {{to raise their children}} to share their <b>identities</b> <b>and</b> values. Its approach is distinctive in two ways: i) it engages in interdisciplinary reflection upon selected findings in psychological literature on immigrant youth, acculturation, <b>and</b> <b>identity</b> development to assess philosophical arguments about parental authority; and ii) it argues that children’s, and not parental, interests should be viewed as the primary basis for parental rights to instill <b>identities</b> <b>and</b> values. Ultimately, the article argues, parental authority to instill <b>identities</b> <b>and</b> values is justified by children’s interests in psychological wellbeing and personal autonomy...|$|R
