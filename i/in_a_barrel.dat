5|$|Harold Francis Davidson (14 July 1875– 30 July 1937), {{generally}} {{known as}} the Rector of Stiffkey, was a Church of England priest who in 1932, after a public scandal, was convicted of immorality by a church court and defrocked. Davidson strongly protested his innocence and {{to raise funds for}} his reinstatement campaign he exhibited himself <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrel</b> on the Blackpool seafront. He performed in other sideshows of a similar nature, and died after being attacked by a lion in whose cage he was appearing in a seaside spectacular.|$|E
5|$|Later, Walt and Jesse {{dispose of}} Victor's body, the gun that killed Gale, {{and the box}} cutter <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrel</b> of {{hydrofluoric}} acid. During breakfast later, Walt insists to Jesse that Gale's death was necessary, but expresses concern that Gus will kill them at his next opportunity. Jesse doubts this, believing {{it will be too}} much trouble for Gus to find another drug manufacturer, and that both they and Gus understand the situation: neither can kill the other, so Gus might as well make them wish they were dead. The episode ends with police investigating Gale's apartment with the camera focusing on his lab notes which have yet to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|Diermot {{enters the}} dragon's cave and wakes him up. The dragon agrees to help Diermot, {{revealing}} that Turnvale was {{the domain of}} a demon long before humans came to the area. This demon should have died along with his breed long ago, but did not perish because {{it was able to}} feed on man's greed and ambition in order to survive. The demon was driven out by the great Gethryn, but the young sorceress Selena's meddling with evil has reawakened the demon, and it controls her mortal form. The dragon possesses the Eye of Gethryn, an enchanted stone left by Gethryn {{at the time of his}} death. The stone contains the power to defeat the demon, and the dragon then gives the stone to Diermot. A Skorl named Wayne, who turns against Selena, sneaks Diermot into Selena's castle <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrel.</b> Diermot defeats Selena with the Eye of Gethryn, freeing Turnvale from her tyranny.|$|E

25|$|In 1843, James Joule {{experimentally}} {{found the}} mechanical equivalent of heat. In 1845, Joule reported his best-known experiment, involving {{the use of}} a falling weight to spin a paddle-wheel <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrel</b> of water, which allowed him to estimate a mechanical equivalent of heat of 819ft·lbf/Btu (4.41 J/cal). This led to the theory of conservation of energy and explained why heat can do work.|$|E
25|$|The actual work on Weingut I {{began in}} July 1944. According to plans, the bunker {{would be made}} up of 12 arches {{stretching}} east to west <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrel</b> vault 400 meters long and 85 meters wide. The arches would have an internal height of 32.2 m, 19.2 m of which was under the ground level. Their thickness reached 3 meters, and would have eventually reached 5 meters through a further concrete pour.|$|E
25|$|If {{the myth}} lacks any {{specific}} scenarios, the MythBusters will test every reasonable scenario, {{and just one}} scenario is {{enough for them to}} confirm the myth. For example, when testing to see whether shooting fish <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrel</b> was in fact very easy, in most tests, they could not hit the fish with a bullet, but the energy transfer to the water by the bullet was lethal to the fish; therefore, the myth was confirmed.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} often {{repeated}} myths is that people found guilty of witchcraft were rolled down Slieau Whallian, a hill near St John's, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrel.</b> However this is a 19th-century legend {{which in turn is}} a Scottish legend which in turn is a German legend. It never happened. Separately, a witchcraft museum was opened at the Witches Mill, Castletown in 1951. There has never actually been a witches' coven on that site; the myth was only created {{with the opening of the}} museum.|$|E
25|$|The battlements and machicolations {{are still}} {{visible on the}} walls, with the beams of another on the top floors. This part of the tower is covered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrel</b> vault, while a terrace is located on its surface, with an {{external}} staircase to access the second floor (between the floor and roof), allowing communication between both by doorway.

When Aaron was fourteen, he was apprenticed to a trade to help support the family. According to his brief memoirs, he first earned 25 cents per day at a cutting machine <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrel</b> stave factory, and then stacking brick in a kiln at 30 cents a day.|$|E

25|$|Barrel {{racing and}} pole bending – the timed speed and agility events seen in rodeo {{as well as}} gymkhana or O-Mok-See competition. Both men and women compete in speed events at gymkhanas or O-Mok-Sees; however, at most professional, sanctioned rodeos, barrel racing is an {{exclusively}} women's sport. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrel</b> race, horse and rider gallop around a cloverleaf pattern of barrels, making agile turns without knocking the barrels over. In pole bending, horse and rider run {{the length of a}} line of six upright poles, turn sharply and weave through the poles, turn again and weave back, then return to the start.|$|E
25|$|On August 5, 2014, {{suspects}} were identified until the arson investigation. The {{suspects were}} being questioned, {{but declined to}} mention their age, identity or quantity. The next day, Paul Myers, {{the chief of the}} Police Department, noted that they would be making arrests soon in connection with the arson. On August 8, charges were processed against a 14-year-old of second-degree criminal mischief, third-degree burglary, second-degree reckless endangerment and fourth-degree arson for his actions. Chief Myers also noted that day the fire began <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrel</b> inside the depot and after the investigation, only one person was charged.|$|E
25|$|Packaging is the {{operation}} {{to put the}} wine in the container in which it will be marketed. Over the ages it was kept <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrel</b> or cask and the client would fill his pitcher or bottle at the wine merchant. The appearance of the glass bottle revolutionized the world of wine. The absence of transfer and thus contact with the oxygen in the air has made a significant improvement {{to the quality of}} the product. Other containers have emerged: the brick from Tetra Pak, the bottle of polyethylene terephthalate or PET, the beverage can, and the Bag-In-Box. Their quality is in their chemical inertness in relation to wine and their hermetic character against oxygen.|$|E

25|$|One story {{tells how}} during a terrible famine, a {{malicious}} butcher lured three little children into his house, where he killed them, placing their remains <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrel</b> to cure, planning {{to sell them}} off as ham. Nicholas, visiting the region {{to care for the}} hungry, not only saw through the butcher's horrific crime but also resurrected the three boys from the barrel by his prayers. Another version of this story, possibly formed around the 11th century, claims that the butcher's victims were instead three clerks who wished to stay the night. The man murdered them, and was advised by his wife to dispose of them by turning them into meat pies. The saint saw through this and brought the men back to life.|$|E
25|$|Perfoliate {{pondweed}} is {{not widely}} cultivated, which is perhaps surprising {{as it is}} not ecologically demanding and is an attractive plant. In common with other pondweeds of this group it roots poorly from stem cuttings and is best propagated by division of the rhizomes. It is easy to grow in a garden pond or even <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrel,</b> but unlike some other submerged plants {{needs to be able}} to root in a suitable substrate such as sand or aquatic compost. Keeping nutrient levels low helps to prevent smothering by algae and more invasive aquatic plants. Plants being established should be weighted down initially to allow them to root, and benefit from being planted among other aquatic plants that can act as a 'nursery'. Transplants have a high survival rate once established.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} precursors of the perp walk, before the term came into use, occurred in 1903. NYPD inspector George W. McClusky had arrested the principal members of the Morello crime family, one of {{the earliest}} dominant Mafia groups in the city, following the discovery of a mutilated, dismembered corpse later identified as a Morello associate from Buffalo <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>barrel</b> outside a Little Italy apartment house, the most notorious of the city's organized crime–related Barrel Murders {{around the turn of the}} 20th century. After they had been in lockup for a night, McClusky had the cuffed suspects marched through the streets of Little Italy, in full view of their fellow Italian immigrants, from police headquarters to the nearby Third Judicial District Courthouse for arraignment, claiming that the paddy wagons in which this would normally be done had not arrived as scheduled.|$|E
