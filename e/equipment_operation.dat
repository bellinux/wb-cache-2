40|$|ABSTRACT: Collisions on {{construction}} sites {{are one of}} the major causes of fatal accidents. The complexity of <b>equipment</b> <b>operations</b> require detailed planning and better real-time control of the work. Research involving artificial intelligence in construction industry has been done to enhance communication between team workers and resolve distributed problems, for example, agent systems have been used for construction claims and dynamic rescheduling negotiation. However, little research has focused on real-time control of construction <b>equipment</b> <b>operations</b> using agents to improve safety on site. The present paper proposes a multi-agent-based approach to provide real-time support to the construction staffs. Collision avoidance is achieved by informing workers and equipment operators about potential collisions, and by providing re-planning for equipment. A prototype system has been developed to and the functionalities of different agents are successfully tested...|$|R

40|$|Proximity Warning Systems are {{currently}} {{the focus of}} many research groups. Their goal is to produce a system that will {{reduce the number of}} run over incidents that occur in large mobile <b>equipment</b> <b>operations.</b> A majority of these incidents occur when the equipment starts from the In-rest state and begins to move. The addition of a transmission locking mechanism to a GPS based proximity warning system will prevent more run over incidents. This transmission locking mechanism will automatically prevent equipment from moving when there is a high risk for a potential run over incident to occur. Additional safety and optimization for surface equipment can be provided by utilizing GIS software for data analysis just by using the data collected from a GPS based proximity warning system. Combining these ideas and methods can provide better safety for large mobile <b>equipment</b> <b>operations...</b>|$|R
