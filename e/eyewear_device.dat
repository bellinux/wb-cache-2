50|$|Recon has {{received}} investments from companies including Motorola Solutions and Intel. It's also partnered with enterprise software vendors {{in order to}} make its latest smart <b>eyewear</b> <b>device,</b> the Jet, suitable for industrial applications.|$|E
5000|$|Recon's first {{products}} were smart goggles {{and what the}} company marketed as [...] "heads-up displays" [...] aimed at the winter sports market. More recently, the company broadened its focus with the Jet, a smart <b>eyewear</b> <b>device</b> designed for activities like cycling and running.|$|E
50|$|Laster Technologies {{products}} include <b>eyewear</b> <b>devices</b> {{coupled with}} software enabling man-machine interface {{functions such as}} gestural recognition, digital image correlation and tracking, and voice recognition. Potential applications for these products include defense and security, industrial maintenance, medical data monitoring and imaging, navigation, and sports.|$|R
40|$|One {{promising}} {{method to}} provide text input on smart <b>eyewear</b> <b>devices,</b> {{that has yet}} to be explored, is to use the device’s built in touch input. Specifically, a number of smart <b>eyewear</b> <b>devices</b> are now including a touchpad for gesture-based input on the side of the glasses (e. g. Google Glass, SiME Smart Glasses, Recon Jet, Optivent Ora). However, given their limited input space of these touchpads, text entry may still be difficult. Recent research on Smart Watch interaction has helped identify a number of promising techniques for text-entry which require very small input real estate. These include ZoomBoard [22], SplitBoard [9], Callout [13], and ZShift [13]. However, these techniques all require direct target acquisition on the display surface. In contrast, Swipeboard is a watch-based technique that specifies each characte...|$|R
50|$|In January 2008, Kopin Corporation {{announced}} a 0.44 inch (1.12 cm) SVGA LCD with a pixel density of 2272 PPI (each pixel only 11.25μm). In 2011 they followed this {{up with a}} 3760 DPI 0.21” diagonal VGA colour display. The manufacturer says they designed the LCD to be optically magnified, as in high-resolution <b>eyewear</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Wikitude SDK is the company's core product. First {{launched}} in October 2008, the SDK includes image recognition & tracking, 3D model rendering, video overlay, location based AR, and SLAM technology (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) which enables object recognition and tracking, {{as well as}} markerless instant tracking. The cross platform SDK is available for Android and iOS operating systems, and is optimized for several smart <b>eyewear</b> <b>devices.</b>|$|R
40|$|Smart <b>eyewear</b> <b>devices</b> {{may serve}} as {{advanced}} interfaces between cyber-physical systems (CPS) and workers by integrating digital information into the visual field. We have addressed ergonomic {{issues related to the}} use of a ruggedized head-mounted display (HMD) (Liteye 750 A, see-through and look-around mode) and a conventional screen during a half-day day working shift (N= 60). We only found minor physiological effects of the HMD, resulting into inflexible head posture, higher muscle activity over time of the left M. Splenius capitis and low performance given its look-around mode...|$|R
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in Comptes Rendus Physique [© Elsevier France] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] this paper, we first present a feasibility study to design 4 G antennas (700 – 960 MHz and 1. 7 – 2. 7 GHz) for <b>eyewear</b> <b>devices.</b> Those <b>eyewear</b> <b>devices</b> should {{be connected to the}} last generation cellular networks, Wireless Local Area Networks or wireless hotspots. Three coupling element type antennas with their matching networks are evaluated in terms of reflection coefficient and total radiation efficiency when the eyewear is placed on the user's head. We also present Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) simulations when the eyewear is positioned over a homogeneous SAM phantom and over a heterogeneous VH (Visible Human) phantom: the SAR levels are compared to international limit values. In a second step, we present experimental results obtained with 3 D printed eyewear and coupling elements etched on a classical PCB substrate where the matching circuits are optimized close to the feeding point of the coupling element. Simulated and measured values are in very good agreement: 7 to 16 % and 9 to 35 % total efficiency are respectively obtained for the low- and high-frequency bands. However, simulated SAR values are somewhat higher than authorized levels with preoccupant high electromagnetic field distribution close to the eye of the user...|$|R
