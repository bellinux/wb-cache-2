40|$|The {{diversity}} and continually {{changing nature of}} the research and production programs at the ORR plant sites, {{as well as the}} size of the facilities and their physical separation on the ORR, lead to the buildup of surplus equipment and materials from canceled or completed projects, changes in work orders or directives, or over-procurement of particular items or materials. Many times, for lack of a means to find legitimate uses for these <b>excess</b> <b>items,</b> they have been disposed of as wastes or sold as salvage. Recognizing that this situation prevails at most, if not all, government facilities, Congress has enacted legislation encouraging the establishment of waste minimization, pollution prevention, and cost avoidance measures throughout government-owned facilities. In response to this, the Secretary of Energy has instituted a high-priority DOE initiative to develop, promote, and implement waste minimization and pollution prevention at government installations. One result of the increased awareness and emphasis on environmental concerns and improved resource management is the recent grassroots development of a surplus materials exchange network developed and operated on a voluntary basis by Environmental Protection Officers (EPOs) at the Oak Ridge installations. The EPOs are full-time or part-time staff members employed by each division to provide guidance and assistance for achieving compliance with all environmental regulatory requirements and to resolve waste disposal problems. The materials exchange network, called the SWAP SHOP, provides an EPO communications and problem-solving network to help eliminate unnecessary disposal of usable surplus chemicals and equipment at the Oak Ridge plant sites...|$|R

30|$|Inventory {{management}} is generally attracted for large stock for several reasons: an attractive price discount for bulk purchase, the replenishment cost including transportation cost {{is higher than}} the inventory related cost, the demand of an item is very high, and so on. Therefore, due to space limitation of showroom, one (or sometimes more than one) warehouse(s) is hired on rental basis to store the <b>excess</b> <b>items.</b> The secondary warehouse (SW) may be located away from the showroom or nearer to the showroom. The actual service to the customer is done at the showroom only. Hartely [16] first introduced the basic two warehouses problem in his book Operations Research - A Managerial Emphasis. After Hartely [16], a number of research papers have been published by different authors. Among them, the work done by Sarma [17], Dave [18], Goswami and Chaudhuri [19], Pakkala and Achary [20], Bhunia and Maiti [21], Benkherouf [22], Zhou [23], Kar et al. [24], and Chung and Huang [25] are worth mentioning. Dey et al. [26] considered a finite-time horizon inventory problem for a deteriorating item having two separate warehouses with interval-valued lead time under inflation and a time value of money. Liang and Zhou [27] investigated a two-warehouse inventory model for deteriorating items under conditionally permissible delay in payments. Hariga [28] proposed an EOQ model with multiple storage facilities where both owned and rented warehouses had limited stock capacity. They assumed the rented warehouse had higher unit holding costs than the own warehouse but offered better preservation resulting in a lower rate of deterioration for the goods than in the own warehouse.|$|R

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{amount of}} geographic data is now freely {{available on the}} Internet, and this number {{is expected to increase}} as monitoring systems and sensors are becoming a ubiquitous part of our environment. A substantial subset is structured as networks (or graphs). Notable examples are import/export of goods, networks of climate stations, flight connections, migration flows and Internet traffic. To fully comprehend such networks, it is needed to know both their geographic and relational information. For this purpose, the most common visual representation is the node-link diagram, where vertices are depicted as points and the edges connecting them are drawn as lines. This Thesis focuses on an instance of node-link diagrams, where nodes are over-imposed on a map and fixed according to their geographical information. The major issue of this visualization is the visual clutter of nodes or edges, defined in literature as "the state in which <b>excess</b> <b>items,</b> or their representation or organization, lead to a degradation of performance at some task". In particular, nodes and links may cause occlusion and ambiguity in the graph representation. Such problems characterize a cluttered diagram because they reduce the potential usefulness of the visualization. The goal of this thesis is to advance {{the state of the art}} in Graph Visualization with respect to visual clutter. On the theoretical perspective, our goal is to acquire a deep understanding of existing approaches for visualizing geographic networks and for reducing visual clutter. Initially, we provide a classification of geographic node-link diagrams and a survey on techniques to reduce the visual clutter on such visualizations. Afterwards, we present a schematization of techniques that helps the reader to decide, given a task and a geographical node-link diagram, which are the candidate solutions that help to reduce the visual clutter. On the practical perspective, our goal is the development of visualization and interaction techniques to overcome various issues of the state-of-the-art approaches. On the one hand, we present an interactive lens that faces the issues of links organization over a map. On the other hand, we describe a deformation-based technique that reveals nodes and links otherwise hidden behind the globe surface. Finally, we introduce a method that automatically generates flow map layouts starting from multivariate geographical datasets...|$|R

30|$|Families, friends, employers, {{and churches}} were also {{important}} sources of {{aid for the}} replacement of household items and clothing needs. These aid sources seemed to focus their assistance on non-monetary forms of aid, specifically through the distribution of <b>excess</b> inventory <b>items</b> such as household goods or donations provided in-kind. The survey showed that content losses, such as clothing, appliances, and furniture, were easier to obtain through non-profit and informal relief sources than assistance for structural repairs, though this often did not matter, if a household {{did not have a}} permanent home, or place to store things. The Red Cross and Salvation Army assisted primarily with food and the replacement of belongings, such as appliances, clothing, and other household items. The ease of content replacement is an indication to the type of help that is perceived as “appropriate,” and easy for a community to galvanize around (Rossé 1993). Formal community-based sources of aid, such as Red Cross, Salvation Army, local governmental entities, and even in the informal sector, such as neighbors and employers, did not show significant variations in the sources of aid accessed between Anglos and combined minorities. However, when comparing Anglos to each ethnic group separately, through an ANOVA, significant differences were evident between Anglos and African-Americans. Albeit, none of these sources were important in the housing recovery process.|$|R
40|$|Predator {{satiation}} and prey-size preference {{were determined}} for locally caught lionfish, schoolmaster, and graysby, all co-occurring predatory fishes in the Florida coral reef ecosystem. Individuals {{were evaluated by}} exposing them to wild-caught killifish over a gradient of four size classes (20 mm to 60 mm, in 10 mm increments). Preference trials extended over a 2 hr time period and were filmed to determine {{the order in which}} each prey item was consumed. Satiation was evaluated by exposing the predators to an equal number of <b>excess</b> prey <b>items</b> for 24 hrs and evaluating consumed prey weight. Lionfish and schoolmaster showed a significant preference for the smallest size class (20 - 30 mm) while the graysby preferred the largest (50 - 60 mm) and smallest equally. Graysby were shown to consume the least amount of food per gram by biomass (0. 034 g/gram predator- 1) while lionfish consumed the most (0. 079 g/gram predator- 1). A significant difference was also found between consumption rates of lionfish and schoolmaster (0. 053 g/gram predator- 1). If consumption is compared by length between species, lionfish (= 0. 051 g/mm predator- 1) and schoolmaster (= 0. 061 g/mm predator- 1) consumption was not significantly different. These results suggest that lionfish success may stem from its ability to target prey sizes not preferred by the graysby while able to outcompete schoolmaster for the same prey size class. However, if the lionfish is compared on an individual level to schoolmaster by individual or length, consumption is similar, suggesting lionfish consumption is not significantly greater on the reef than the native species on an individual basis...|$|R
50|$|Under {{the study}} for Hedonic motivation, there {{is quite a}} bit of {{research}} on how this type of motivation can influence people's shopping habits. Hedonic goods are consumed for luxury purposes, which are desirable objects that allow the consumer to feel pleasure, fun, and enjoyment from buying the product. This is the difference from Utilitarian goods, which are purchased for their practical uses and are based on the consumer's needs. Because of this, the consumer is generally willing to spend more on luxury hedonic items because they can rationalize that these items are more enjoyable, and won't be purchased very frequently, which allows the buyer to be less price sensitive towards these items. However, {{it is important to note}} that in any purchase situation a consumer evaluates both hedonic and utilitarian motivation values simultaneously, both leading toward a purchase decision. These goods could constitute anything from pedicures to art to furniture to new power tools to fine chocolate; basically anything that a consumer enjoys on less than a regular basis. Utility goods are items that are purchased frequently and are a regular part of the consumer's life, which allows the consumer to be more price sensitive towards these goods because they are purchased and used frequently. These items can be cleaning fluid, laundry detergent, clothing, toilet paper, or other items that a consumer uses regularly. Guilt also has a tendency to be associated with hedonic purchases. This is due to these items being bought for means that are associated with pleasure and <b>excess,</b> not <b>items</b> that are necessary for daily life and are therefore not as easy to justify buying as utilitarian items. Luxury goods and utilitarian goods both serve purposes for consumers when shopping. The positive hedonic influence comes from the buying of luxury goods for enjoyment and stimulation, and utilitarian goods are items bought out of necessity and don't necessarily bring any joy to the consumer. These are both areas of hedonic motivation that work on the consumers preferences and are expressed through physical goods and services purchased.|$|R

The material originl from the US nuclear weapons complex. The diversity of the chemical form and the heterogenous physical form of this inventory were anticipated to challenge the precision and accuracy of quantitative destructive analytical techniques. A sampling design was used to estimate the degree of heterogeneity of the plutonium content {{of a variety of}} inventory items. Plutonium concentration, the item net weight, and the {sup 240 }Pu content were among the variables considered in the design. Samples were obtained from randomly selected location within each item. Each sample was divided into aliquots and analyzed chemically. Operator measurements by calorimetry and IAEA measurements by coincident neutron nondestructive analysis also were performed for the initial physical inventory verification materials and similar items not yet under IAEA safeguards. The heterogeneity testing has confirmed that part of the material is indeed significantly heterogeneous; this means that precautionary measures must be taken to obtain representative samples for destructive analysis. In addition, the sampling variability due to material heterogeneity was found to be comparable with, or greater than, the variability of the operator`s calorimetric measurements...|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{deposit of}} PhD theses {{produced}} by postgraduate research students in St Andrews {{was introduced in}} academic session 2006 / 7 and mandated as part of University regulations for the delivery and deposit of theses within the institution. The move to the new service was primarily driven by University Library planning and policy which clearly identified the need for improved service provision to the local, national and international research community by making {{the change in the}} deposit and delivery mechanism. University strategic planning with regard to making research outputs available to a wider audience was also a major driver to the development. This has been achieved by the transfer of the deposit procedure from the previous format of print copies of theses delivered in closed access in library stack to free online delivery in an open access institutional repository. The number of theses in the St Andrews Digital Research Repository is now in <b>excess</b> of 200 <b>items.</b> The success of the current service is very dependent on key partnerships which have been established between relevant agencies within the institution. Communication and establishment of workflows between the Library and the Academic Management and Support Office are crucial. Collaboration to support and train postgraduate students in the new deposit procedures has very much focused on partnerships between the Library, Copyright and FOI officers, Supervisors and the St Andrews Gradskills programme which is specifically designed to develop postgraduate research skills. The process has been one of constant re-evaluation of institutional and user needs and the provision of a high quality service. This has resulted in the development of relevant policies with regard to restrictions/embargoes, support for copyright issues, support for technical and file format issues, and streamlined workflows for administrators of the institutional repository. There have also been significant training and reskilling issues for university staff working closely with the service and many opportunities for contact with other relevant projects and external support agencies. This poster describes how our thesis service has developed and how the institutional framework has been put in place to support the service. It suggests key factors which must be addressed to enable such a service to grow and become embedded in institutional practice. The current electronic thesis deposit service in St Andrews should also be seen in the context of local policy to encourage the retrospective digitization of earlier theses and the establishment of workflows and permission letters to authors to achieve this. This also includes membership of the national EThos project. A further context is the inclusion of electronic theses into the St Andrews Digital Research Repository which is now just developing a service to extend its content into all University Research Publications by feeding content from the University's Research Expertise Database. This will make significant changes in the scholarly communication process for all St Andrews research outputs. Postprin...|$|R
