The stress intensity factors of the small edge interface crack are analyzed by the crack tip stress method with varying the crack length, adhesive thickness and material combination. The stress intensity factor of the edge interface crack {{is controlled by the}} singular stress field at the interface free edge in butt joint without the crack when the crack is very small. The calculation shows that the stress intensity factors K 1 and K 2 of the small edge interface crack are related to the intensity of singular stress field Kσ and the singularity index λ 12 at the interface edge without the crack. Then, it is found that the stress intensity factors can be expressed as K 1 ＋iK 2 = (F 1 ＋iF 2) Kσaλ 12 － 0. 5 √π(1 ＋ 2 iε) and the normalized stress intensity factors F 1 and F 2 are constant values when the crack length a/h< 10 - 2 irrespective of the adhesive thickness and length of butt <b>joint</b> <b>plate.</b> Therefore, it can be concluded that K 1 and Kσ are an equivalent parameter each other...|$|E
