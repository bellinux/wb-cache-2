5000|$|A {{feedthrough}} is {{a conductor}} {{used to carry}} a signal through an enclosure or printed circuit board. Like any conductor, it has {{a small amount of}} capacitance.

Power <b>feedthroughs</b> are used to carry either high current or high voltage. Instrumentation <b>feedthroughs</b> are used to carry electrical signals (including thermocouples) which are normally low current or voltage. Another special type is what is commonly known as RF-feedthrough, specifically designed to carry very high frequency RF or microwave electrical signals.|$|E

50|$|Hermetic metal {{packaging}} began life in {{the vacuum}} tube industry, where a totally leak-proof housing was essential to operation. This industry developed the glass-seal electrical feedthrough, using alloys such as Kovar to match the coefficient of expansion of the sealing glass so as to minimize mechanical stress on the critical metal-glass bond as the tube warmed up. Some later tubes used metal cases and <b>feedthroughs,</b> and only the insulation around the individual <b>feedthroughs</b> used glass. Today, glass-seal packages are used mostly in critical components and assemblies for aerospace use, where leakage must be prevented even under extreme changes in temperature, pressure, and humidity.|$|E
50|$|Magnetic liquid rotary seals {{operate with}} no {{maintenance}} and extremely low leakage {{in a very}} wide range of applications. Ferrofluid-based seals used in industrial and scientific applications are most often packaged in mechanical seal assemblies called rotary <b>feedthroughs,</b> which also contain a central shaft, ball bearings and an outer housing. The ball bearings provide two important functions: maintaining the shaft's centering within the seal gap, and supporting external loads. The bearings are the only mechanical wear-items, as the dynamic seal is actually a series of rings made of ultra-low vapor pressure, oil-based liquid held magnetically between the rotor and stator. Therefore, the operating life and equipment maintenance cycles are generally very long, and the drag torque very low. The magnet material is permanently charged and requires no electrical power or other re-energizing or maintenance. Ferrofluid-sealed <b>feedthroughs</b> reach performance levels that other technologies can't achieve, by optimizing features such as ferrofluid viscosity and magnetic strength, magnet and steel materials, bearing arrangements, and water cooling for applications with extremely high speeds or temperatures. Ferrofluid-sealed <b>feedthroughs</b> routinely operate in environments including ultra-high vacuum (below 10−8 mbar), temperatures over 1,000 °C, {{tens of thousands of}} RPM, and multiple-atmosphere pressures.|$|E
50|$|Glass frit bonding can be {{used for}} many surface materials, e.g., silicon with {{hydrophobic}} and hydrophilic surface, silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, aluminium, titanium or glass, as long as the CTE are in the same range. This bonding procedure also allows the realization of metallic <b>feedthroughs</b> to contact active structures in the hermetically sealed cavity. Glass frit as a dielectric material does not need additional passivation for preventing leakage currents at process temperatures up to 125 °C.|$|E
50|$|A vacuum <b>feedthrough</b> is {{a flange}} that {{contains}} a vacuum-tight electrical, physical or mechanical connection to the vacuum chamber. An electrical <b>feedthrough</b> allows voltages {{to be applied to}} components under vacuum, for example a filament or heater. An example of a physical <b>feedthrough</b> is a vacuum-tight connection for cooling water. A mechanical <b>feedthrough</b> is used for rotation and translation of components under vacuum. A wobble stick is a mechanical <b>feedthrough</b> device {{that can be used to}} pick up, move and otherwise manipulate objects in the vacuum chamber.|$|R
5000|$|In analog electronics, Clock <b>feedthrough</b> is {{the result}} of the {{coupling}} between control signals on the analog switch and analog signal passing through the switch. In digital electronics, clock <b>feedthrough</b> is the coupling of the clock signal to the nodes where coupling is not intended. Such coupling happens because of the gate-to-source capacitance, interconnects parasitic capacitance or because of the substrate coupling. Clock <b>feedthrough</b> is generally considered harmful.

40|$|<b>Feedthrough</b> and {{awareness}} of user activities are major issues in CSCW. A key difference between awareness and goal-directed <b>feedthrough</b> lies in the required pace and quality of <b>feedthrough.</b> Getting the right pace of <b>feedthrough</b> is important for usability and to avoid overloading networks. Notification mechanisms should therefore allow dynamic tuning of the pace and volume of update events. This matching of the required and supplied pace of update events we call impedance matching. A separable notification server is often ideally placed to perform impedance matching between enduser clients. These design principles have been applied in an experimental notification server Getting-to-Know...|$|R
50|$|Iron is {{only rarely}} used for <b>feedthroughs,</b> but {{frequently}} gets coated with vitreous enamel, where the interface {{is also a}} glass-metal bond. The bond strength is also governed by {{the character of the}} oxide layer on its surface. A presence of cobalt in the glass leads to a chemical reaction between the metallic iron and cobalt oxide, yielding iron oxide dissolved in glass and cobalt alloying with the iron and forming dendrites, growing into the glass and improving the bond strength.|$|E
50|$|When {{mounting}} the TSP in the chamber, {{a number}} of important considerations must be made. First, it is desirable that the filament can deposit on a large area. However, one must take care that the titanium is not deposited onto anything it can damage. For example, electrical <b>feedthroughs</b> containing ceramic insulators will fail if the titanium forms a conducting film which bridges the ceramic insulator. Samples may become contaminated by titanium if they have line-of-sight to the pump. Also, titanium is a very hard material, so titanium film which builds up {{on the inside of the}} chamber may form flakes which fall into mechanical components (typically turbomolecular pumps and valves) and damage them.|$|E
50|$|Molybdenum {{bonds to}} the glass via the {{intermediate}} layer of molybdenum(IV) oxide. Due to its low thermal expansion coefficient, matched to glass, molybdenum, like tungsten, is often used for glass-metal bonds especially in conjunction with aluminium-silicate glass. Its high electrical conductivity makes it superior over nickel-cobalt-iron alloys. It is favored by the lighting industry as <b>feedthroughs</b> for lightbulbs and other devices. Molybdenum oxidizes much faster than tungsten and quickly develops a thick oxide layer that does not adhere well, its oxidation should be therefore limited to just yellowish or at most blue-green color. The oxide is volatile and evaporates as a white smoke above 700 °C; excess oxide can be removed by heating in inert gas (argon) at 1000 °C. Molybdenum strips are used instead of wires where higher currents (and higher cross-sections of the conductors) are needed.|$|E

The mechanism for clock <b>feedthrough</b> and a related model of a transmission gate switch are established in the current-voltage domain. A region map is developed for the TG switch during the period when both devices are turned off. The region map is further divided into zones. From these region and zone maps, the sign and relative magnitude of the clock <b>feedthrough</b> noise can be efficiently estimated for different signal levels.

5000|$|The first ion pump {{was invented}} by Varian Associates, now Agilent. The {{original}} activity of Varian, co-founded in 1948 by Russell Varian, {{the inventor of the}} Klystron, and his brother Sigurd, was in the field of microwave electron tubes. Robert Jepsen joined the company in 1951 and soon became director of the Klystron research group. His investigation about electronic vacuum pumping led in 1957 to the realization of the first sputter ion pump (SIP), later named VacIon pump, of which he was co-inventor.The pump was developed as an appendage pump for maintaining Ultra High Vacuum (UHV) in microwave power tubes after processing, but soon after honeycomb-shaped anodes and commercial VacIon pumps with speeds of thousands of liters per second were produced. Lewis Hall and John Helmer were members of the research team, involved in the choice of the most suitable cathode material and in the optimization of the ion pump design. Sherm Rutherford joined Varian in February 1959 in the Central Research Department (which, soon after, spun off the Vacuum Division). His activity, working for Robert Jepsen, was to study the behavior of the sputter ion pump (in terms of pumping speed and discharge intensity I/P) over a wide range of parameters, such as magnetic field, voltage, anode cell diameter, anode cell length and pressure. Renn Zaphiropoulos joined the Vacuum Division in 1959 and was engaged in scaling up the ion pump from the original appendage pump to a full range of large pumps up to 5000 l/s [...] His group worked on high voltage <b>feedthroughs,</b> magnets, control units, systems, flanges, valves, sorption pumps and Titanium Sublimation Pumps (TSP). In 1960 the “slotted” titanium cathode, named “Super VacIon Pump”, was introduced on the basis of observations about noble gas pumping mechanism and unstable Argon pumping phenomena. In the same years triode pumps were invented by W.M. Brubaker (Consolidated Electrodynamics Corporation) and Varian, now Agilent, began to sell them in the late ‘60s under the name “Noble Ion Pumps”, then changed the name to “Triode Ion Pumps” in the early ‘70s.|$|E

40|$|The {{interface}} between medical implants {{and the human}} nervous system is rapidly {{becoming more and more}} complex. This rise in complexity is driving the need for increasing numbers of densely packed electrical feedthrough to carry signals to and from implanted devices. This is particularly crucial in the ﬁeld of neural prosthesis where high resolution stimulating or recording arrays near peripheral nerves or in the brain could dramatically improve the performance of these devices. Here we describe a ﬂexible strategy for implementing high density, high count arrays of hermetic electrical <b>feedthroughs</b> by forming conducting nitrogen doped nanocrystalline diamond channels within an insulating polycrystalline diamond substrate. A unique feature of these arrays is that the <b>feedthroughs</b> can themselves be used as stimulating electrodes for neural tissue.
