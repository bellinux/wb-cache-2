25|$|Laurents {{was horrified}} {{when he saw}} the first rough cut of the film. He thought there were a few good scenes, and some good moments in bad scenes, but overall <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> badly photographed jumbled mess lacking coherence. Both stars {{appeared}} to be playing themselves more often than their characters, and Streisand often used a grand accent that Laurents felt hurt her performance. Pollack admitted the film was not good, accepted full responsibility for its problems, and apologized for his behavior. The following day he retreated to the editing room to improve it as much as possible. Laurents felt the changes made it better but never as good as it could have been.|$|E

25|$|On 4 January 1804 Raven sailed from Malta as escort to the {{merchant}} ship Dolphin, bound for Naples. She was following a course {{along the south}} coast of Sicily that would take her between the islands of Favignana and Marettimo. In {{the evening of the}} next day master's mate Robert Incledon had the watch and saw a light shape in the moonless night. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> sail {{but it turned out to}} be a tower on the cliffs near Mazari, on the south west coast of Sicily. At 11pm she ran aground. Despite efforts to lighten and free her, efforts that extended into the afternoon of 6 January, the pumps were unable to clear the water that was coming in and she had to be abandoned. Dolphin rescued her crew. The court martial on 10 February 1805 admonished the master for having steered too near the land.|$|E
25|$|Sydney trainer Harry Telford persuaded American {{businessman}} David J. Davis to buy {{the colt}} at auction, based on his pedigree. Telford's brother Hugh, who lived in New Zealand, was asked to bid up to 190 guineas at the 1928 Trentham Yearling Sales. When the horse was obtained for a mere 160 guineas, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> great bargain until the colt arrived in Australia. The horse was gangly, his face was covered with warts, and he had an awkward gait. Davis was furious {{when he saw the}} colt as well, and refused to pay to train the horse. Telford had not been particularly successful as a trainer, and Davis was one of his few remaining owners. To placate Davis, he agreed to train the horse for nothing, in exchange for a two-thirds share of any winnings. Telford leased the horse for three years and was eventually sold joint ownership by Davis.|$|E

Although {{he did not}} believe it was a 'grand slam', <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> [...] "pleasant surprise and strong first effort". Charlie Steffens of KNAC described the album as [...] "goddamn electric", while Greg Maki of live-metal.net awarded the album a perfect 10 out of 10 selecting it as his [...] "best album I have heard so far in 2006."

500|$|The {{idea for}} casting the screenwriter Amol Gupte {{came from the}} casting {{director}} Honey Terhan. Gupte {{said that when he}} received a call from Terham, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> joke. He stated, [...] "A man named Honey introduced himself as Vishal Bhardwaj's casting director and offered me a very important role. I banged the phone down not believing a word of what he said". However, after meeting Bhradwaj and hearing a script reading, he loved the story and accepted the offer. The actors Chandan Roy Sanyal, Shiv Subramnayam, Hrishikesh Joshi, Rajatava Dutta and Deb Mukherjee were cast in supporting roles. For the role of drug dealer Tashi, Bhardwaj chose his friend Tenzing Nimaa tour operator in Mussooriesaying he had the character and attitude he wanted, and a weird sense of humour.|$|E
500|$|The Guardian {{published}} three {{reviews of}} the episode. Sam Wollaston gave the episode a positive review; <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> [...] "wonderful episode" [...] that [...] "would be hard to top". Wollaston joked in his review about Richard Dawkins's cameo, and compared his anti-theological mannerisms to the Daleks. Gareth McLean described {{the end of the}} episode as a [...] "genuine, jaw-dropping, outta-nowhere cliffhanger". [...] He commended the production team for successfully suppressing information about the regeneration in an industry often stifled by leaks. Stephen Brook of The Guardians media blog Organgrinder, thought the episode was [...] "unbelievably good" [...] and [...] "genuinely scary and exciting". [...] He theorised about the questionable regeneration: whether it was genuine and, if so, who would portray the next incarnation of the Doctor; and which companion will die in [...] "Journey's End".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. The A.V. Club's Noel Murray graded {{the episode}} with a B, explaining {{that while he}} thought it was [...] "much more fun" [...] than the previous week's episode and enjoyed Peter's expanded presence, he was growing slightly wearied by the [...] "hint-dropping" [...] of Peter's past. Murray thought the climax was [...] "so exciting" [...] that he was willing [...] "to forgive {{the fact that this is}} the third week in a row that Walter's big idea has involved some kind of communication with the unconscious". IGN's Travis Fickett rated it 7.5/10, writing that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> solid episode because the [...] "characters are coming together nicely, the story is better than last week's – but already it seems the show is hitting a formula". Fickett expressed worriment that Fringe would eventually become too formulaic, much like the first season of Smallville, and concluded his review by calling Fringe [...] "a solid show, but [...] exceptional yet".|$|E

500|$|Michelle Erica Green, {{writing for}} TrekNation, {{compared}} {{the actions of}} Archer in this episode to those of Kathryn Janeway {{in the second part}} of the [...] episode [...] ", but felt that here it came across as [...] "callous and horrific". She felt that Archer's actions were typical of a [...] "Hollywood fantasy (or nightmare) post-9/11 leader" [...] but thought that they were realistic. She also praised other elements such as the special effects such as the derelict ship, calling it [...] "creepy, vivid, [...] entirely believable." [...] Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews", called the episode [...] "proof that action-centric Trek can indeed work, and work well." [...] <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> vast improvement on the previous episode and found the stronger version of Archer interesting. He praised the soundtrack by Jay Chattaway which he felt suggested that the typical Star Trek music was being revised. He gave the episode a score of three and a half out of four.|$|E

It received 193,000buys, which {{was less than}} the 237,000 buys the previous year's event received. Armageddon helped World Wrestling Entertainment earn $15.9million in revenue from pay-per-view events, but this was less than the $19.9million earned the previous year; Linda McMahon, the CEO of WWE, confirmed this statement on February 24, 2009 in a quarterly financial report. Canadian Online Explorer's professional wrestling section rated the event a perfect ten out of ten. Wade Keller of the PWTorch rated the main event match for the WWE Championship 4 and a quarter stars out of 5. He went on to state that the match was a [...] "really satisfying main event and it's the finish WWE dared not do for a long time."

500|$|Though the Ministry of Transport {{was adamant}} that the {{services}} {{should not be}} destinations in their own right, they did acquire {{a reputation for being}} a popular place for motorists to visit. During the 1960s, the services were a regular stopping venue for bands such as Pink Floyd and the Rolling Stones. The Beatles stopped at Watford Gap while travelling from Liverpool to gigs in the south in the early stage of their career. Jimi Hendrix heard so much about [...] "Blue Boar", as the services were then popularly known, that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> London nightclub. Gerry Marsden, leader of the Pacemakers regularly visited the services when touring, saying it was good for [...] "a quick stop and a quick nosh." [...] The Floyd's Nick Mason recalls Hendrix stopping off at the services at 2am, while The Zombies' Chris White thought the services were [...] "the feeding trough of the beat boom". Harper claimed [...] "everybody would meet at Watford Gap because it was the one place after a show where you were guaranteed a bit of a sit-down at 2am".|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} {{were looking}} for an actor who could portray Silver as a [...] "quirky kid who moves to her own beat". Sachs explained that Jessica Stroup [...] "came in dressed for the part, artsy and quirky, and she had her hair up {{and she had a}} bandana. She nailed it." [...] The producers were fans of Tristan Wilds for his acting on The Wire, and hoped to hire him as Dixon from the start of casting. When asked about Michael Steger, who portrays Navid, Sachs said [...] "he's just great". Rob Estes, the last actor to join the series, was a previous cast member of the first Beverly Hills, 90210 spin-off, Melrose Place. Estes was sought by The CW to play Harry, but was contracted on the drama Women's Murder Club. When that series was canceled, Sachs called Estes and explained the spin-off to him, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> great idea.

500|$|Chris Cabin at Collider {{called the}} short film [...] "dark, funny, {{and just a}} bit punkish", and {{compared}} it to a Saturday Night Live skit. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> smart move from Fox to release [...] "a taste of what [...] love" [...] about the first film to abate fears and rumors following the replacement of Miller with Leitch. Cabin also said it was impressive and clever that the studio managed to keep the short a surprise for general audiences to discover at the theater. Matt Rooney at JoBlo.com called the teaser great, and [...] "a great {{way to keep the}} buzz going for" [...] Deadpool 2 despite not actually revealing anything about that film. Matthew Monagle of Screen Crush said the short proves that the first Deadpool was [...] "not a one-hit wonder for Reynolds and company", and praised its jokes. He also noted its release with Logan as another connection being made by Fox between its X-Men films and Deadpool, pointing toward future crossovers between the two. The Verge's Andrew Liptak said the short was [...] "a fun one", noting the visual gags in the background and the Stan Lee cameo, and saying, [...] "At the very least, [...] we can expect the same irreverent humor in" [...] Deadpool 2 as was in the first film.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Greg Daniels and {{directed}} by Carlos Baeza. It was the second script Daniels wrote for the show. He thought the staff had previously done many episodes where Homer [...] "wasn't good at anything", so he {{tried to figure out}} something Homer was really good at, and he {{came up with the idea}} of Homer being a good husband. While Bart had been the star of the show during the early years, by Season 5, the focus had clearly shifted to Homer. Writer/showrunner Al Jean stated that because Homer is an adult character, he has more depth to him and thus storyline possibilities. Showrunner David Mirkin commented: [...] "Bart, to write him accurately as a child, he can only have so much depth at a certain age. With Homer, we try to explore all levels of adulthood. There are just more places to go. Writing Homer properly is the trick, he's our main rock of the whole series. Homer's IQ is fairly flexible, he won't necessarily understand how to open a door at some point, but he can name the Supreme Court justices. Finding that balance is key to making the show work and making it surprising and making it believable and emotionally grounded." [...] Mirkin was very fond of the fact that Homer and Marge have the biggest fight they have ever had on the show in the episode, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> [...] "really great" [...] exploration of their marriage. He noticed that because Homer is thrown out of the house, the audience really worry about their relationship. Mirkin had been asked many times why Marge and Homer are still together, to which he replied that all people stay together even if they argue, [...] "there's some sort of connection".|$|E

The Falls Count Anywhere match was given the highest rating during their review, at 8 out of 10. The lowest rating was given to the women's tag team match and the Rhino versus Bashir bout, at 5 out of 10. The main event match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship was rated 7 out of 10. Wade Keller of the Pro Wrestling Torch stated during his review that the Falls Count Anywhere match [...] "had an epic feeling for a falls count anywhere brawl. It had various chapters, many convincing near falls, several creative big spots, and the crowd was into it." [...] While regarding the main event, Keller stated <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> [...] "good match." [...] James Caldwell, also of the Pro Wrestling Torch, mentioned during his review that Joe versus Nash had [...] "good drama" [...] due to the storyline [...] "with a big game veteran vs. a big game 'Young Lion' in a compelling match-up. Joe losing should be treated as a huge deal with proper follow-up to move Joe up to the next level. If he's losing, it needs to mean something for his overall growth." [...] Phil Allely, a journalist for The Sun, stated he felt the event was [...] "a thoroughly enjoyable show". The event was released by TNA Home Video on DVD on March 24, 2009 as part of the [...] "TNA Wrestling: Cross The Line Vol. 2" [...] box set, which included the December 2008 Final Resolution event and the Genesis 2009 event.|$|E
500|$|A {{total of}} nine hundred people {{attended}} the event. Canadian Online Explorer writer Chris Sokol rated the entire event a {{six and a}} half out of ten, which was the same rating given to the 2006 Turning Point event.

Compared to rival World Wrestling Entertainment's Armageddon PPV event held on December 16, Turning Point was rated lower as Armageddon was given a seven out of ten by Bob Kapur. In Sokol's review four matches were rated a seven out of ten, his overall highest rating given in the review. The first was the Six Man Tag Team Tables match, which Sokol felt [...] "was a solid match." [...] The second match given this score was the Match of 10,000 Tacks, which Sokol believed to be [...] "just an all out brawl." [...] Sokol rated the Kaz and Booker T versus Christian Cage and Robert Roode bout seven out of ten and stated <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> [...] "good match." [...] The main event was the final one with this rating, which Sokol thought was a [...] "decent" [...] match. The women's tag team match was the lowest rated match in Sokol's review, with a 5 out of 10. Regarding the entire event, Sokol thought that [...] "despite all the chaos, the PPV still churned out some good matches." [...] Wade Keller of the Pro Wrestling Torch published a review of the event, in which his highest rating of two and a three-quarter stars out of five was given to the Six Man Tag Team Tables match, while his lowest of half a star out of five was given to the women's tag team match and the Storm versus Young bout.
