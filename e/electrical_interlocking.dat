5000|$|At the International Exhibition in Sydney in 1880, Arthur Orpen Herbert, the Commissioner for Queensland Railway, was {{impressed}} by a display of McKenzie and Holland interlocking machines. Queensland ordered equipment for Roma Street and Ipswich stations and this arrived in October 1881. Charters Towers initially needed a complex interlocking system because of its gradient, and the system of tram tracks that used {{to run to the}} station from various mine sites. A number of dead-end lines or [...] "traps" [...] were necessary as [...] "roll away" [...] protection for loose wagons. Although 169 Queensland railway stations had interlocking by 1918, mechanical interlocking technology eventually became obsolete, as <b>electrical</b> <b>interlocking</b> or electro- pneumatic systems replaced it. Centralised Traffic Control (CTC) signalling systems now control most of the network. This is an electronic version of interlocking where the signals and points controlling movement, and the allocation of a block of track to a particular train, are operated from a remote location by computer.|$|E
5000|$|In 1935 the {{decision}} was made to resignal the station and approaches, replacing the 1904 electro-pneutmatic power signalling system with an electrically operated system. [...] "Park Street" [...] and [...] "Paragon station" [...] signal boxes were to be replaced with a single box; the running lines out of the station, including those controlled by the West Parade signal box, were to be track circuited. The system was an early British example of <b>electrical</b> <b>interlocking.</b> 48 points were controlled, using thumb switches in the signal box. Power supply was from the Hull Corporation at 400V 50 Hz three phase, with a backup generator powered by a [...] Petter oil-engine. The main external system was electrified at 110V AC, with shunt signals at 100 or 55V AC; the point motors, previously electro-pneumatically operated were retained, with a [...] per hour [...] max. pressure compressor system, duplicated for redundancy. Signalling was electric lamp backlit. The Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company Ltd was the main supplier of the equipment. A new signal box was installed, a LNER type 13, resembling in architectural design the Southern Railway's Streamline Moderne signal boxes, but with square corners.|$|E

40|$|This {{amendment}} {{is in response}} to your application dated September 19, 1985. This amendment revises the requirement in the Order dated March 14, 1983, to install interlocks on the recirculation pump loops at Oyster Creek to prevent isolating four recirculation loops. You proposed to install an alarm to indicate that a fourth recirculation loop has been isolated instead of the original design of <b>electrical</b> <b>interlocks</b> to prevent isolation of more than three recirculation loops. This includes an alarm reflash if the fifth loop was isolated. In our letter to you dated April 16, 1986, the staff concluded that your proposed modification scope change for the Recirculation Loop Interlock was acceptable. We also concluded that the scope change did not meet the requirement in the Order dated March 14, 1983. Therefore, we stated that we would revise this requirement in the Order to agree with the acceptable scope change. This letter is the staff's action to revise this requirement in the Order. This revision will not change the schedule for implementing the Order. Therefore, all plant activities, e. g., installation, operability, procedures, training, associated with putting the alarm in service shall be completed before the restart from the Cycle 11 Refueling outage to meet the schedule in the Order. Also, as requested in our letter dated April 16, 1986, we request you to propose appropriate technical specifications on this alarm before the restart from this outage. On May 19, 1986, the State of New Jersey was consulted in accordance with 10 CFR 50. 91 (b) (4). The state expressed its concern that the staff was not imposing the requirements in the Order.

40|$|The {{development}} of railway interlocking systems is currently very labour-intensive. Specialists develop the interlocking {{design for a}} particular area and manually check for completeness and consistency. The interlocking is implemented in either software or using <b>electrical</b> relays. The <b>interlocking</b> has to be tested against the safety requirements for signalling systems, i. e., the signalling principles. The whole process can be supported by various tools, ranging from editors to animators. In this paper we focus on exploiting model checking to automatically check the design with respect to safety. The main concerns of this technique are the problem size and the e_ciency of available tools. We have investigated both of these problems: seeking {{to work with a}} minimal model of the interlocking design and to improve eciency of the model-checking process by exploiting domain knowledge of our particular application...|$|R

40|$|Thermal energy {{harvesting}} devices have many promising applications due to no emission {{of greenhouse gases}} during the process. Thermoelectric generators convert heat (temperature gradient) to electricity and thus the waste heat from different energy sources such as heat engines, automobiles and industry can be recovered to generate electricity. Therefore, thermoelectric devices are promising candidates for {{energy harvesting}} technologies. The characterization of thin film based organic semiconducting materials is a rapidly developing research and has received great attention because of their applications in low cost fabrication of electronic and photonic devices, such as, light sensitive junction diodes, sensors, solar cells, ield-effect transistors, etc. In the research work reported in this dissertation thermoelectric, electrical, and photonic properties of the semiconducting thin films are undertaken for potential applications {{in the development of}} cost effective thermal energy harvesting technologies and electronic devices. In part I of this dissertation, energy harvesting from solution grown semiconductors via thermoelectric effect are discussed. For thermoelectric applications, three materials are investigated. The first material used is lead sulfide (PbS) grown from solution due to its inherent property of scalability. The solution grown PbS film consists of nanoclusters and has a high Seebeck coefficient, 450 μV/K. The high Seebeck coefficient {{may be the result of}} increased contributions from junctions and boundary scattering of carriers occurring at interfaces between nanocrystallites, consistent with the scanning electron microscopy study of the film morphology. The solution-grown PbS technology may be well suited for energy-harvesting applications. The second and third materials are carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and organic polymer Poly(3, 4 - ethylenedioxythiophene) Polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). In a homogeneous system (CNTs or PEDOT:PSS alone), the Seebeck coefficient and <b>electrical</b> conductivity are <b>interlocked</b> by the Boltzman transport equation. Thus a heterogeneous layered system on a nano scale is developed from CNTs and PEDOT:PSS film to weaken the Boltzman transport and thus change the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity somewhat independently. Thus the thermoelectric properties are enhanced by making heterogeneous system. In part II, the electrical properties of sandwich type heterojunctions are presented. Thin film of organic material cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) were deposited by vacuum thermal evaporation on p- and n-Si with aluminum (Al) as top electrode. The charge transport mechanism was studied and the mobility of the organic thin films, with p- and n-Si as substrate, was calculated. Different parameters of the junctions were extracted from the electrical characteristics such as rectification ratio, reverse saturation current, series/shunt resistances, ideality factor and barrier height. The effect of light on current-voltage characteristics were also studied to show the photonic behavior of CoPc/n-Si heterojunction. The electrical characterization is useful as preliminary studies for further utilization of the CoPc in other electronic devices...|$|R
