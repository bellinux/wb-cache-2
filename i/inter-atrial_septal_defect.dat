This report describes a 26 -year-old young woman, who had recurrent abortions and stillbirths and detected to have marked cyanosis with hypoplastic right heart, sub-arterial ventricular septal defect, absent pulmonary valve, non-compaction of the left ventricle, and bicuspid aortic valve with aortic regurgitation.

40|$|ABSTRACT Combined {{two-dimensional}} and Doppler echocardiography {{has a high}} {{sensitivity and}} specificity for detection of isolated perimembranous ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defects.</b> However, muscular or multiple ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defects</b> {{may be difficult to}} diagnose with noninvasive methods, particularly in older children, necessitating angiography for accurate diagnosis. Detection of single and multiple ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defects</b> with two-dimensional color flow mapping was compared with detection by standard two-dimensional imaging and Doppler. Both techniques were compared with four-chamber left ventricular angiography. Fifty-one patients (age 3 months to 25 years, mean 5. 6 years) were studied. Eighteen had solitary ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defects,</b> 18 had multiple ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defects,</b> and 15 patients with intact ventricular septum served as a control group. At least one ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> was detected by color Doppler and two-dimensional/Doppler methods in all patients with ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> proved by angiography with no false positives. In the detection of multiple ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defects,</b> the sensitivity of color Doppler was 72 % and that of two-dimensional/ Doppler was 38 % (100 % specificity in both). Color Doppler failed to identify multiple ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defects</b> in five patients (two weighing less than 4 kg and three with reduced pulmonary blood flow). However, no large additional muscular defects were missed by imaging and color Doppler...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} prognosis of types of ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defects</b> and coexistence of associated cardiac and extracardiac defects. Methods: 120 prenatal diagnosed pregnancies associated with ventricular septal pathology were retrospectively evaluated and divided into four groups, as atrioventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defects,</b> perimembranous <b>septal</b> <b>defects,</b> muscular <b>septal</b> <b>defects</b> and univentricular formation. Each group was divided further into four groups, as isolated defect, co-existing extracardiac <b>defect,</b> <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> with extracardiac <b>defect</b> and <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> with co-existing cardiac and extracardiac defect. Postnatal follow-up was continued at least until 8 months of life. Results: Median gestational age at diagnosis was 26. 3 weeks, 47 cases were diagnosed before 24 weeks. After dispersion of <b>septal</b> <b>defects</b> there was a statistical significance of p= 0. 0089 between groups. Of 31 cases with atrioventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defects,</b> only one case survived (3. 2 %) and there was a high association with extracardiac defects and abnormal karyotype (p= 0. 002). 69 cases with perimembranous ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defects</b> were diagnosed, and 24 cases (34. 8 %) survived with significance for abnormal karyotype (p= 0. 039). Of 18 cases born with muscular <b>septal</b> <b>defects</b> 12 cases (66. 7 %) stay alive. We had two cases with univentricular structure; both cases decided for termination of pregnancy.

Methods : Ninety-four children with congenital heart disease were enrolled. Their cries and related acoustic variables (fundamental frequency, duration, noise to harmonic ratio, jitter?# 737;?and shimmer) were analyzed using a multi-dimensional voice program. Results : The average fundamental frequency showed {{a significant decrease in}} patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect,</b> and tetralogy of Fallot, except in atrial <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> and pulmonary stenosis. The length of the analyzed sample (duration) did not show a significant difference when compared with the control group. There was a significant increase in jitter percent in ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect,</b> patent ductus arteriosus, and atrial <b>septal</b> <b>defect.</b> There was an increase in shimmer in ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect,</b> patent ductus arteriosus, and atrial <b>septal</b> <b>defect.</b> The noise-to-harmonic ratio increased in ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect,</b> patent ductus arteriosus, and atrial <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> but {{there was no significant difference}} in pulmonary stenosis and tetralogy of Fallot. While analyzing acoustic variables, the voice change was significantly higher, especially in patent ductus arteriosus followed by ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> and atrial <b>septal</b> <b>defect.</b> Most of these acoustic variables were deviant in left-to-right shunt lesions in congenital heart disease, especially in patent ductus artriosus. Conclusion : The results of the voice change analysis of preoperative children with congenital heart disease revealed that the acoustic variables differed by each congenital heart disease.

40|$|ObjectiveIn this study, {{we tested}} 3 {{techniques}} of atrial <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> closure under real-time 3 -dimensional echocardiography guidance in a swine model. MethodsThe operations were conducted under the sole guidance of a modified real-time 3 -dimensional echocardiography guidance {{system with a}} × 4 matrix transducer (Sonos 7500, Philips Medical Systems, Andover, Mass). Eighteen swine were anesthetized, and after median sternotomy, the echo probe was applied directly {{to the surface of}} the right atrium. To create an atrial <b>septal</b> <b>defect,</b> balloon atrial septostomy and atrial <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> enlargement were performed. Subsequently, 3 different techniques of atrial <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> closure were attempted: group I, direct suture closure; group II, closure of the atrial <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> using the Amplatzer device (AGA Medical Corp, Golden Valley, Minn); and group III, patch closure of the atrial <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> (n = 6 each). ResultsReal-time 3 -dimensional echocardiography guidance provided sufficient spatial resolution and a satisfactory frame rate to provide a “virtual surgeon’s view” of the relevant anatomy during the entire procedure. All atrial <b>septal</b> <b>defects</b> were enlarged, and the mean final size was 8. 5 ± 1. 8 mm. Atrial <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> closure was successfully accomplished with all the 3 surgical techniques examined. In groups I and III, the needles (1 - 3 sutures) and staples (6 - 12 staples) penetrated the tissue and patch material consistently, whereas in group III, the Amplatzer atrial <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> device was easily deployed. There was no incident device/staple embolization or air introduction. Neither intraoperative 2 -dimensional color Doppler echocardiography nor postmortem macro-evaluation revealed any residual shunts. ConclusionsBeating heart atrial <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> closure under real-time 3 -dimensional echocardiographic guidance is feasible and, unlike catheter-based devices, applicable for any type of secundum atrial <b>septal</b> <b>defect...</b>|$|R

40|$|Study: Retrospective {{study of}} 33 {{patients}} with multiple VSD during March 2009 to March 2014. Technique: The defects were located by injecting the cardioplegia solution into left atrium after oc-cluding the pulmonary artery. Through right atrial approach, the large ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defects</b> were closed by pericardial patch. The smaller ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defects</b> were closed directly. Results: Out of 33 patients, 20 patients were multiple ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defects,</b> 5 patients were atrioventri-cular canal defect with multiple ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defects</b> and 8 patients were transposition of great arteries with multiple ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defects.</b> All the patients had severe pulmonary arterial hypertension.

40|$|Twenty-three {{consecutive}} {{patients with}} clinical (auscultatory and electrocardiographic) signs of uncomplicated atrial <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> of secundum or sinus venosus type were examined by chest x-ray, phonocardiography, and echocardiography, before right heart catheterisation. Seventeen (74 %) had atrial <b>septal</b> <b>defect,</b> two patients (9 %) had insignificant pulmonary stenosis, and four subjects (17 %) were normal. No false positive diagnosis of atrial <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> {{was made by}} chest x-ray examination, whereas increased vascular markings were incorrectly interpreted as pulmonary congestion in one case. Four patients had x-ray films showing questionable signs of left-to-right shunt. Six of 15 patients with a large left-to-right shunt were correctly selected for surgery based on radiological findings. One false negative but no false positive diagnosis of atrial <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> was made by phonocardiography.

40|$|ObjectiveCreation or {{enlargement}} of a ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> is indicated in rare clinical situations. In {{the setting of}} double-outlet right ventricle requiring single-ventricle palliation, left ventricular outflow tract obstruction caused by progressive restriction at the ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> poses an uncommon but recognized dilemma. In this situation surgical ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> enlargement may be desirable but risks damage to the atrioventricular valve or conduction system. We report {{the results of a}} novel technique for transcatheter creation or {{enlargement of}} ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defects</b> as an alternative to reoperation when decompression of an isolated ventricle is indicated. MethodsEight patients had undergone transcatheter ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> enlargement or creation, and 3 of these patients had undergone 4 prior surgical attempts at left ventricular decompression. Ventricular aneurysms had developed in 3 patients before intervention. ResultsFive patients underwent ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> creation, and 3 patients underwent enlargement of existing ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defects.</b> Initial intervention resulted in a decreased ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> pressure gradient from 76. 9 mm Hg to 20. 3 mm Hg (P =. 004). There was no procedural mortality or sustained heart block. Two patients had moderate-to-severe atrioventricular valve regurgitation, and 1 required surgical repair. At last follow-up, all ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defects</b> remained patent, with recurrent obstruction in the majority of cases caused by muscular hypertrophy beyond the stent margins. In 1 patient a ventricular aneurysm has regressed in size. Repeat intervention reduced recurrent obstruction, but recurrence was the rule. ConclusionsWhen reoperation is considered high risk, transcatheter creation and enlargement of ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defects</b> is possible with excellent short-term results. Recurrent obstruction is common but responds to repeated intervention. Further studies are required to establish clinical benefit...|$|R

We wish to report our experience in three patients who underwent percutaneous closure of a post-traumatic ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> with a patent ductus arteriosus occluder. METHODS: We treated three patients with post-traumatic ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defects</b> caused by stab wounds with knives. After the heart wound was repaired, patient examinations revealed ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defects</b> with pulmonary/systemic flow ratios (Qp/Qs) of over 1. 7. The post-traumatic ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defects</b> were closed percutaneously with a patent ductus arteriosus occluder (Lifetech Scientific (Shenzhen) Co., LTD, Guangdong, China) utilizing standard techniques. RESULTS: Post-operative transthoracic echocardiography revealed no residual left-to-right shunt and indicated normal ventricular function. In addition, 320 -slice computerized tomography showed that the occluder was well placed and exhibited normal morphology.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] The {{starting}} {{hypothesis was}} that some perimembranous ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defects</b> can be closed safely and effectively with a Bard Rashkind double umbrella introduced through a long transvenous sheath. DESIGN [...] A descriptive study of all patients who underwent attempted transcatheter umbrella closure of a perimembranous ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect.</b> Those patients selected for the study had symptoms of a ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> and a perimembranous ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> shown by transthoracic echocardiography. The morphological criteria used were a posterior perimembranous defect with a diameter of 0. 45, a Doppler derived right ventricular systolic pressure of > 50 mm Hg, and a pulmonary to systemic flow ratio > 3 : 1. SETTING [...] A tertiary referral centre. PATIENTS [...] 13 infants, children, and adolescents with a perimembranous ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> aged 3 weeks to 16 years and weighing 1. 8 - 46 kg. INTERVENTIONS [...] A modified Rashkind ductal double umbrella was introduced through a long transvenous sheath and positioned {{on either side of}} the ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect.</b> Placement was guided by transoesophageal echocardiography. RESULTS [...] 10 out of 13 patients underwent successful partial or complete closure of a perimembranous ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect.</b> There were three placement failures. Two of these were associated with a ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> too large for the umbrella device. In a third case the umbrella was opened in the left ventricular outflow tract necessitating surgical removal and closure of the ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect.</b> CONCLUSION [...] Transcatheter umbrella closure of a perimembranous ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> is technically feasible and can be therapeutically successful, although the procedure is moderately difficult to perform and the mean procedure time is > 120 minutes. It is an alternative to surgery in some cases, but the overall results would not support its routine use even with the introduction of larger devices of the current design...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveOur {{purpose was}} to {{evaluate}} the effect of ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> enlargement on the early and late morbidity and mortality of patients undergoing Rastelli or Rastelli-type operations. MethodsA total of 49 patients who underwent Rastelli or Rastelli-type operations between 1991 and 2007 were included in a retrospective follow-up study. Patients were divided into 2 groups: group A had ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> enlargement, and group B did not have ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> enlargement for comparison. Risk factor analysis for early or late death included patient-related and procedure-related variables, with failure, arrhythmia, and atrioventricular block as outcome parameters. ResultsMedian age and weight {{at the time of}} the operation were 6 years (range, 3 months– 22 years) and 17 kg (range, 7 – 48 kg), respectively. The ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> was enlarged in 28 (57 %) patients. Ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> enlargement showed a significant statistical relation with late ventricular dysfunction, arrhythmia, and residual ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> (P =. 023, P =. 047, and P =. 01, respectively, log-rank test). No relation was found between ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> enlargement and permanent pacemaker implantation (P =. 73, log-rank test). Furthermore, enlargement of the ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> did not show any significant effect on the rate of early mortality (P =. 69, Cox regression). Kaplan–Meier estimated survival for patients with ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> enlargement was 74 % at 5 years and 65 % at 10 years. Freedom from late death in the group without ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> enlargement was 100 % at 5 and 10 years and 83 % at 15 years. At a median follow-up of 4 years (range, 6 months– 16 years), there were 12 late-onset deaths: 11 in group A (n = 28) and 1 in group B (n = 21). Ventricular <b>septal</b> <b>defect</b> enlargement greatly increased the risk of late death (P =. 009, Cox regression).
