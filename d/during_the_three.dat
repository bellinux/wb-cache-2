5|$|After the war, the Navy's accomplishments {{paid off}} {{in the form of}} better funding, and it {{embarked}} on the construction of many new ships. However, the expense of the larger ships was prohibitive, and many of them stayed in shipyards half-completed, in readiness for another war, until the Age of Sail had almost completely passed. The main force of the Navy continued to be large sailing frigates with a number of smaller sloops <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> decades of peace. By the 1840s, the Navy began to adopt steam power and shell guns, but they lagged behind the French and British in adopting the new technologies.|$|E
5|$|By 1916, Peeler {{was living}} in the Melbourne suburb of Richmond with his wife and three daughters. On 17 February, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force for service in the First World War.

5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> years (1967–69) {{that this}} playoff {{structure}} was in effect, {{there was one}} use of the tie-breaker system. In 1967, the Los Angeles Rams and Baltimore Colts ended the season tied at 11–1–2 for {{the lead in the}} Coastal Division. The Colts came into the last game of the season undefeated, but were beaten by the Rams. Though the Colts shared the best win/loss record in the NFL that year, they failed to advance to the playoffs while three other teams with worse records won their divisions. This event figured into the decision in 1970 to include a wild-card team in the playoff tournament after the AFL–NFL merger.|$|E
5|$|In Deshastha {{families}} Ganeshotsav is {{more commonly}} known as Gauri-Ganpati because it also incorporates the Gauri Festival.In some families Gauri {{is also known as}} Lakshmi puja. It is celebrated for three days; on the first day, Lakshmi's arrival is observed. The ladies in the family will bring statues of Lakshmi from the door to the place where they will be worshiped. The Kokanstha Brahmins, instead of statues, use special stones as symbols of Gauri. The statues are settled at a certain location (very near the Devaghar), adorned with clothes and ornaments. On the second day, the family members get together and prepare a meal consisting of puran poli. This day is the puja day of Mahalakshmi and the meal is offered to Mahalakshmi and her blessings sought. On the third day, Mahalakshmi goes to her husband's home. Before the departure, ladies in the family will invite the neighbourhood ladies for exchange of haldi-kumkum. It is customary for the whole family to get together <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> days of Mahalakshmi puja. Most families consider Mahalakshmi as their daughter who is living with her husband's family all the year; but visits her parents' (maher) <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> days.|$|E

5|$|Merit system: The {{earliest}} {{example of}} a merit system {{dates back to the}} Qin and Han dynasties. In order to maintain power over a large, sprawling empire, it became necessary for the government to maintain a complex network of officials. Prospective officials could come from a rural background and government positions were not restricted to the nobility. Rank was determined by merit, through the civil service examinations, and education became the key for social mobility. After the fall of the Han Dynasty, the nine-rank system was established <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Three</b> Kingdoms period. The concept of a merit system spread from China to British India during the 17th century, and then into continental Europe and the United States.|$|E
5|$|Some climate {{scientists}} have theorized that aircraft contrails (also called vapor trails) are implicated in global dimming, but the constant flow of air traffic previously meant {{that this could}} not be tested. The near-total shutdown of civil air traffic <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> days following the September 11, 2001 attacks afforded a unique opportunity in which to observe the climate of the United States absent from the effect of contrails. During this period, an increase in diurnal temperature variation of over 1°C (1.8°F) was observed {{in some parts of}} the U.S., i.e. aircraft contrails may have been raising nighttime temperatures and/or lowering daytime temperatures by much more than previously thought.|$|E

5|$|Celadon: Named after a pale-tinted spring green colour, Chinese {{archaeologist}} Wang Zhongshu (1982) {{asserts that}} shards having {{this type of}} ceramic glaze have been recovered from Eastern Han Dynasty (25–220 AD) tomb excavations in Zhejiang; he also asserts {{that this type of}} ceramic became well known <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>Three</b> Kingdoms (220–265). Richard Dewar (2002) disagrees with Wang's classification, stating that true celadon—which requires a minimum 1260°C (2300°F) furnace temperature, a preferred range of 1285° to 1305°C (2345° to 2381°F), and reduced firing—was not created until the beginning of the Northern Song Dynasty (960–1127). The unique grey or green celadon glaze is a result of iron oxide's transformation from ferric to ferrous iron (Fe2O3 → FeO) during the firing process. Longquan celadon wares, which Nigel Wood (1999) writes were first made during the Northern Song, had bluish, blue-green, and olive green glazes and high silica and alkali contents which resembled later porcelain wares made at Jingdezhen and Dehua rather than stonewares.|$|E
5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> {{months of}} his rule, Minh, his {{civilian}} Prime Minister Nguyen Ngoc Tho, and his leading military colleagues, Generals Trần Văn Đôn and Lê Văn Kim, attempted to defeat the National Liberation Front (Viet Cong) non-militarily. They felt that a battleground victory was impractical or impossible and pursued a strategy of trying to politically integrate the insurgents into the mainstream. This meant an intensification of rural non-military initiatives {{and a reduction in}} armed operations. This brought them into conflict with the United States, who had plans to start bombing North Vietnam. At the same time, in January 1964, the French government of President Charles de Gaulle proposed the neutralization of Vietnam and the withdrawal of American forces. Khánh and his fellow plotters exploited this to spread rumors that Minh's junta was about to make a deal with Hanoi and then gained the support of the US, most notably through the chief of military forces in Vietnam, General Paul Harkins, who supported Diệm and opposed Minh's November coup.|$|E

5|$|González-Gordon {{has been}} {{described}} as being proud of his Scottish heritage, which centred on the town of Huntly and the Clan Gordon. His personal clothing style reflected this; he was noted for his tweed jackets and British clothes in general. He had been married to Milagro López de Carrizosa y Eizaguirre for 62 years before she died in July 2013. The couple had two children, Bibiana and Mauricio, with Mauricio being the current president of the family company. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> final years of his life González-Gordon was in poor health and could hardly leave his home. He died on 27 September 2013 in his hometown of Jerez de la Frontera at the age of 89. His family claims that the last thing he drank was a Tío Pepe, the most famous brand of the family business. His death occurred at the Asisa clinic where he had spent his last couple of weeks. The memorial service was held at the San Juan Bautista de La Salle church on 28 September.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Cade was {{approached}} by Dewayne Douglas, an assistant coach for the Florida Gators football team, about the extreme dehydration faced by Gator football players practicing in the high temperatures and humidity of the Deep South in late summer and early fall. Douglas questioned Cade why his football players did not urinate during practice and games. Cade learned from anecdotal evidence that football players were losing water through perspiration and failing to replace fluid during practice and games. Cade's research team discovered that football players were losing up to 18 pounds (8.2 kilograms) <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> hours of a college football game, and that ninety to ninety-five percent of that loss was water. A player's plasma volume could decrease as much as seven percent and blood volume by five percent, and sodium and chloride were excreted in the sweat.|$|E
5|$|In 518, Scupi was {{destroyed}} by a violent earthquake, possibly the most devastating one Macedonia has ever experienced. At that time, the region was threatened by the Barbarian invasions, and the city inhabitants had already fled in forests and mountains before the disaster occurred. Scupi was eventually rebuilt by Justinian I. During his reign, many Byzantine towns were relocated on hills and other easily defendable places to face invasions. Scupi was thus transferred on another site: the promontory on which stands the fortress. However, Scupi was sacked by Slavs {{at the end of}} the 6th century and the city seems to have fallen under Slavic rule in 695. The Slavic tribe which settled in Scupi were probably the Berziti who had invaded the entire Vardar valley. The city is not mentioned <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>three</b> following centuries but along with the rest of Upper Vardar it became part of the expanding First Bulgarian Empire in the 830s.|$|E
