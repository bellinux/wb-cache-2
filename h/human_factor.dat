The <b>Human</b> <b>Factors</b> areas examined {{in this article are}} organizational, cognitive and physical ergonomics. A key question to be explored is as follows: To what degree are the petroleum industry and safety authorities in Norway focusing on these <b>Human</b> <b>Factors</b> areas from the design phase? To investigate this, we conducted an innovative exploratory study of the development of four control centres in Norwegian oil and gas industry in collaboration between users, management and <b>Human</b> <b>Factors</b> experts. We also performed a literature survey and discussion with the professional <b>Human</b> <b>Factors</b> network in Norway. We investigated the <b>Human</b> <b>Factors</b> focus, reasons for not considering <b>Human</b> <b>Factors</b> and consequences of missing <b>Human</b> <b>Factors</b> in safety management. The results revealed an immature focus and organization of <b>Human</b> <b>Factors.</b> Expertise on organizational ergonomics and cognitive ergonomics are missing from companies and safety authorities and are poorly prioritized during the development. The easy observable part of <b>Human</b> <b>Factors</b> (i. e. physical ergonomics) is often in focus. Poor focus on <b>Human</b> <b>Factors</b> in the design process creates demanding conditions for human operators and impact safety and resilience. There is lack of non-technical skills such as communication and decision-making. New technical equipment such as Closed Circuit Television is implemented without appropriate use of <b>Human</b> <b>Factors</b> standards. <b>Human</b> <b>Factors</b> expertise should be involved as early as possible in the responsible organizations.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a number of}} views from a panel discussion {{on the relationship between}} human reliability analysis (HRA) and <b>human</b> <b>factors.</b> HRA emerged concurrently with the field of <b>human</b> <b>factors</b> and now features a nearly fifty-year shared history. While built on <b>human</b> <b>factors,</b> HRA distinguished itself early on from <b>human</b> <b>factors</b> due to its emphasis on predicting human performance. While one of the major focus areas of <b>human</b> <b>factors</b> has been improving the design of novel systems to optimize human performance, HRA has largely focused on predicting human performance for as-built systems. Over time, as HRA became closely tied particularly to the nuclear energy industry, it increasingly became a field associated more with reliability engineering than <b>human</b> <b>factors.</b> Yet, the similarity to <b>human</b> <b>factors</b> has not abated, nor has the opportunity for the two fields to cooperate. <b>Human</b> <b>factors</b> research provides the empirical basis to support predicting human performance in HRA. Importantly, HRA continues to benefit <b>human</b> <b>factors</b> by providing: (1) a framework for modeling human performance, (2) an example of how a <b>human</b> <b>factors</b> discipline can be seamlessly integrated with an engineering field, and (3) insights on how predictiv...|$|R

25|$|Other thinkers soon {{offered more}} {{ideas on the}} roles that workers play in mature {{industrial}} systems. These included ideas on improvement of the individual worker with attention to the worker's needs, not just {{the needs of the}} whole. James Hartness published The <b>Human</b> <b>Factor</b> in Works Management in 1912, while Frank Gilbreth and Lillian Moller Gilbreth offered their own alternatives to Taylorism. The human relations school of management evolved in the 1930s to complement rather than replace scientific management, with Taylorism determining the organisation of the work process, and human relations helping to adapt the workers to the new procedures. Today's efficiency-seeking methods, such as lean manufacturing, include respect for workers and fulfillment of their needs as integral parts of the theory. (Workers slogging their way through workdays in the business world do encounter flawed implementations of these methods that make jobs unpleasant; but these implementations generally lack managerial competence in matching theory to execution.) Clearly a syncretism has occurred since Taylor's day, although its implementation has been uneven, as lean management in capable hands has produced good results for both managers and workers, but in incompetent hands has damaged enterprises.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{demonstrate}} how research on emotion in sport psychology might inform the field of <b>human</b> <b>factors.</b> Background: <b>Human</b> <b>factors</b> historically has paid little attention to the role of emotion within the research on human-system relations. The theories, methods, and practices related to research on emotion within sport psychology might be informative for <b>human</b> <b>factors</b> because fundamentally, sport psychology and <b>human</b> <b>factors</b> are applied fields concerned with enhancing performance in complex, real-world domains. Method: Reviews of three areas of theory and research on emotion in sport psychology are presented, and the relevancy of each area for <b>human</b> <b>factors</b> is proposed: (a) emotional preparation and regulation for performance, (b) an emotional trait explanation for risk taking in sport, and (c) the link between emotion and motor behavior. Finally, there are suggestions for how to continue cross-talk between <b>human</b> <b>factors</b> and sport psychology about research on emotion and related topics in the future. Results: The relevance of theory and research on emotion in sport psychology for <b>human</b> <b>factors</b> is demonstrated.
