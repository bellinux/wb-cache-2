Experimental results showed that most benzene and phenol compounds were present in gas phase but most dioxins were present in solid phase.

With additive CaO, the emission rate of HCl and the formations of chlorobenzenes and chlorophenols through Deacon Reactions were reduced, especially at higher operation temperature 800 degrees C. With additive CuO, the decompositions of benzene and phenol compounds were enhanced; however, more chlorobenzenes and chlorophenols were formed in specific cases such as incinerating organic chloride at lower temperature 600 degrees C.

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} paper presents {{an analysis of}} total <b>chloride</b> <b>contents</b> in concrete. The concrete mixtures that were approved by the municipality of Riyadh city in Saudi Arabia for a main ready mix concrete plant were considered in this study. The analysis {{was based on an}} experimental investigation of chloride levels in mixing water, aggregates, and concrete. The analysis also used the maximal total chloride limits of British Standards for the concrete in conjunction with other ingredients required for the mix. The results obtained suggest that the effect of <b>chloride</b> <b>content</b> in mixing water has minimal to moderate influence upon the <b>chloride</b> <b>content</b> of concrete up to w/c equal to 0. 4. It also shows that aggregate is the critical ingredient in terms of determining the presence of chloride in concrete. Critically, the limits of <b>chloride</b> <b>content</b> in any concrete mix could be violated even though the limits of <b>chloride</b> <b>content</b> still meet some standards for their content within concrete ingredients. The proportions of any mix design are also an important factor to be considered when attempting to specify the limits of <b>chloride</b> <b>content</b> of the ingredients of concrete mixtures for any type of concrete. It is vital to investigate empirically the relationship between total <b>chloride</b> and <b>chloride</b> <b>contents</b> in ingredients in order to precisely define the limits of <b>chloride</b> <b>content</b> in concrete mix ingredients.

40|$|Total organic halogen (TOX) {{is used as}} a {{parameter}} {{to screen}} groundwater samples at the Hanford Site. Trending is done for each groundwater well, and changes in TOX and other screening parameters can lead to costly changes in the monitoring protocol. The Waste Sampling and Characterization Facility (WSCF) analyzes groundwater samples for TOX using the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) SW- 846 method 9020 B (EPA 1996 a). Samples from the Soil and Groundwater Remediation Project (S&GRP) are submitted to the WSCF for analysis without information regarding the source of the sample; each sample is in essence a 'blind' sample to the laboratory. Feedback from the S&GRP indicated that some of the WSCF-generated TOX data from groundwater wells had a number of outlier values based on the historical trends (Anastos 2008 a). Additionally, analysts at WSCF observed inconsistent TOX results among field sample replicates. Therefore, the WSCF lab performed an investigation of the TOX analysis to determine the cause of the outlier data points. Two causes were found that contributed to generating out-of-trend TOX data: (1) The presence of <b>inorganic</b> <b>chloride</b> in the groundwater samples: at <b>inorganic</b> <b>chloride</b> concentrations greater than about 10 parts per million (ppm), apparent TOX values increase with increasing chloride concentration. A parallel observation is the increase in apparent breakthrough of TOX from the first to the second activated-carbon adsorption tubes with increasing <b>inorganic</b> <b>chloride</b> concentration. (2) During the sample preparation step, excessive purging of the adsorption tubes with oxygen pressurization gas after sample loading may cause channeling in the activated-carbon bed. This channeling leads to poor removal of <b>inorganic</b> <b>chloride</b> during the subsequent wash step with aqueous potassium nitrate. The presence of this residual <b>inorganic</b> <b>chloride</b> then produces erroneously high TOX values. Changes in sample preparation were studied to more effectively remove <b>inorganic</b> <b>chloride</b> from the activated carbon adsorption tubes. With the TOX sample preparation equipment and TOX analyzers at WSCF, the nitrate wash recommended by EPA SW- 846 method 9020 B was found to be inadequate to remove <b>inorganic</b> <b>chloride</b> interference. Increasing the nitrate wash concentration from 10 grams per liter (g/L) to 100 g/L potassium nitrate and increasing the nitrate wash volume from 3 milliliters (mL) to 10 mL effectively removed the <b>inorganic</b> <b>chloride</b> up to at least 100 ppm chloride in the sample matrix. Excessive purging of the adsorption tubes during sample preparation was eliminated. These changes in sample preparation have been incorporated in the analytical procedure. The results using the revised sample preparation procedure show better agreement of TOX values both for replicate analyses of single samples and for the analysis of replicate samples acquired from the same groundwater well. Furthermore, less apparent column breakthrough now occurs with the revised procedure. One additional modification made to sample preparation was to discontinue the treatment of groundwater samples with sodium bisulfite. Sodium bisulfite is used to remove inorganic chlorine from the sample; inorganic chlorine is not expected to be a constituent in these groundwater samples. Several other factors were also investigated as possible sources of anomalous TOX results: (1) Instrument instability: examination of the history of results for TOX laboratory control samples and initial calibration verification standards indicate good long-term precision for the method and instrument. Determination of a method detection limit of 2. 3 ppb in a deionized water matrix indicates the method and instrumentation have good stability and repeatability. (2) Non-linear instrument response: the instrument is shown to have good linear response from zero to 200 parts per billion (ppb) TOX. This concentration range encompasses the majority of samples received at WSCF for TOX analysis. (3) Improper sample preservation: ion-chromatographic analysis of several samples with anomalous TOX results revealed that the samples were properly preserved with sulfuric acid and not hydrochloric acid...|$|R

In waste incineration, large amounts of publicity and concern surrounded dioxin-like compounds during the 1980s-1990s continues to pervade the public consciousness, especially when new incineration and waste-to-energy facilities are proposed. As a result of these concerns, incineration processes have been improved with increased combustion temperatures (over 1000 Â°C), better furnace control, and sufficient residence time allotted to ensure complete oxidation of organic compounds.

In applying this alternative, the <b>chloride</b> <b>content</b> and the sea sand shape particles are the major problems that should be taken note. High level of <b>chloride</b> <b>content</b> is possibility affecting the strength of the construction structure. Therefore the sea sand that will used should be washed first to reduce the <b>chloride</b> <b>content</b> for a particular period of time.

40|$|Chloride {{transport}} {{in concrete}} {{is a rather}} complex process. There are numerous different models one can use to estimate chloride ingress in concrete. The fib model code presents a model based on an error function solution to Fick s 2 nd law, called the fib model. The fib model is relatively simple to use compared to other approaches. In this model, a difference in concentration is the driving potential for the chloride transport. It is assumed that the concrete is crack free, homogeneous and that the chloride ingress is one dimensional at macro-scale. The aim of this thesis is to investigate which of the fib model input parameters that have {{the highest level of}} sensitivity and how the model performs as a tool for predicting the transport of chlorides into concrete for an exposure time of 2 and 5 years. To accomplish this, a sensitivity analysis, a differential analysis and a comparison between exposure data and predictions made by the fib model will be performed. From the sensitivity analysis, we see that the chloride surface concentration, the ageing exponent, the chloride migration coefficient and the depth at which we want to know the <b>chloride</b> <b>content</b> has a large impact on the predicted <b>chloride</b> <b>content.</b> A large change in the <b>chloride</b> <b>content</b> is observed when these parameters are varied from the highest to the lowest value within their range. A small variation in these parameters will also {{have a significant impact on}} the <b>chloride</b> <b>content.</b> From the differential analysis we see that the ageing exponent and the depth at which we want to determine the <b>chloride</b> <b>content</b> are the parameters with the largest absolute value of the first order sensitivity coefficients, almost two times larger than the apparent diffusion coefficient and the surface <b>chloride</b> <b>content.</b> A change in the transfer variable and the parameter that describes the temperature of the structural element or the ambient air results in a small change in the <b>chloride</b> <b>content.</b> The parameter with the least influence on the <b>chloride</b> <b>content</b> is by a large margin the regression variable. The input parameters that have the largest sensitivity and therefore needs to be determined with a high level of accuracy is the ageing exponent, chloride migration coefficient, chloride surface concentration and the depth at which we want to determine the <b>chloride</b> <b>content.</b> Parameters that are less important and can be used with a bigger scatter without influencing the model to a critical degree is the transfer variable, the regression variable and the temperature of the structural element or the ambient air.
