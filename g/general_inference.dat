So that had any other genius equal in other respects to the greatest that ever enlightened the world, arisen in that age, he would have been superior to all, from this circumstance alone--that had conceptions would have assumed a more harmonious and perfect form. For it is worthy of observation, that whatever the poet of that age produced is as harmonious and perfect as possible. In a drama, for instance, were the composition of a person of inferior talent, it was still homogeneous and free from inequalities it was a whole, consistent with itself. The compositions of great minds bore throughout the sustained stamp of their greatness. In the poetry of succeeding ages the expectations are often exalted on Icarian wings, and fall, too much disappointed to give a memory and a name to the oblivious pool in which they fell.|$|E

60|$|This {{throwing}} of {{the whole}} body of possible inferences from a given set of particulars, into one general expression, operates as a security for their being just inferences, {{in more ways than}} one. First, the general principle presents a larger object to the imagination than any of the singular propositions which it contains. A process of thought which leads to a comprehensive generality, is felt as of greater importance than one which terminates in an insulated fact; and the mind is, even unconsciously, led to bestow greater attention upon the process, and to weigh more carefully the sufficiency of the experience appealed to, for supporting the inference grounded upon it. There is another, and a more important, advantage. In reasoning from a course of individual observations to some new and unobserved case, which we are but imperfectly acquainted with (or we should not be inquiring into it), and in which, since we are inquiring into it, we probably feel a peculiar interest; there is very little to prevent us from giving way to negligence, or to any bias which may affect our wishes or our imagination, and, under that influence, accepting insufficient evidence as sufficient. But if, instead of concluding straight to the particular case, we place before ourselves an entire class of facts—the whole contents of a general proposition, every tittle of which is legitimately inferable from our premises, if that one particular conclusion is so; there is then a considerable likelihood that if the premises are insufficient, and the <b>general</b> <b>inference</b> therefore, groundless, it will comprise within it some fact or facts the reverse of which we already know to be true; and we shall thus discover the error in our generalization by a reductio ad impossibile.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{top-down}} {{effects as}} well. That is, <b>general</b> <b>inference</b> patterns, such as implication (if ... then inferences), or disjunction (either ... or inferences), are constructed by mapping domain-specific inference patterns onto {{each other through}} the hypercognitive process of metarepresentation. Metarepresentation is the primary top-down mechanism of cognitive change which looks for, codifies, and typifies similarities between mental experiences (past or present) to enhance understanding and problem-solving efficiency. In logical terms, metarepresentation is analogical reasoning applied to mental experiences or operations, rather than to representations of environmental stimuli. For example, if ... then sentences are heard over many different occasions in everyday language: if you are a good child then I will give you a toy; if it rains and you stay out then you become wet; if the glass falls on the floor then it brakes in pieces; etc. When a child realizes that the sequencing of the if ... then connectives in language is associated with situations in which the event or thing specified by if always comes first and it leads to the event or thing specified by then, this child is actually formulating the inference schema of implication. With development, the schema becomes a reasoning frame for predictions and interpretations of actual events or conversations about them.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, I {{argue that}} the DRT Construction Rules for plural antecedents are redundant, because they are subsumed by an {{inference}} mechanism that must be made generally available for anaphora resolution. While Kamp and Reyle originally argued against a <b>general</b> <b>inference</b> mechanism for plural anaphora, I {{argue that the}} facts of compset anaphora require inference. Furthermore, I observe that compset anaphora is blocked by refset anaphora. I consider an alternative DRT account, in which inference coexists with Construction Rules. I argue that the Construction Rules are not necessary to capture the blocking generalization; rather, I argue that refset descriptions are semantically primed, thus deriving the blocking generalization in terms of <b>general</b> <b>inference,</b> together with an independently required mechanism of semantic priming. I argue that this alternative is to be preferred on grounds of theoretical parsimony. Furthermore, I present an argument that the <b>general</b> <b>inference</b> account correctly captures the fact that plural descriptions can be interpreted at {{the position of the}} plural pronoun, while the DRT account incorrectly requires that they be interpreted at the position of the antecedent. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} frame {{selection}} in parsing is discussed, with {{the focus on}} the selection of a frame for texts which contain highly ambiguous or vague words. An approach to frame selection is presented which involves the use of a small number of <b>general</b> <b>inference</b> rules, in conjunction with a hierarchically-organized conceptual memory. This is in contrast to various other methods, which rely either on disambiguation rules stored in the dictionary definitions of ambiguous words, or on previously-activated frames to guide the selection of new frames.

The method presented here does not suffer from these same problems because of the hierarchical organization of memory and the <b>general</b> <b>inference</b> rules used. ...|$|E

40|$|Inference {{theory in}} survey {{sampling}} {{has been developed}} separately in different branches. There exists design-, model- and model-design-based inference. Design-based inference is often classified as a descriptive and model-(design) -based as an analytic inference. A notion of the sampling design has caused further specialization of the inference theory. Under the design-based approach there exists inference separately for without-replacement and with-replacement sampling designs (Cassel, Särndal, Wretman 1977). Under the model-(design) -based approach there exists inference for noninformative (ignorable) and informative sampling designs (Pfeffermann 1993). It seems that the <b>general</b> <b>inference</b> theory is still missing in survey sampling. The <b>general</b> <b>inference</b> theory should lie on the distributional assumptions of survey data so that the above described branches appear as special cases through modified assumptions. Distributional assumptions of survey data will then enable us to apply the existing classical statistical methods (of course, more complicated {{due to the lack}} of the iid property) for deriving estimators and their statistical properties and for carrying through a sophisticated analytic inference. For example, the wide spread discussion about the role of the sampling weights in the analytic inference looses its topic.
