This means that the member state of the exporting merchant does not collect VAT on the sale, but still gives the exporting merchant a credit for the VAT paid on the purchase by the exporter (in practice this often means a cash refund). The <b>importing</b> <b>member</b> <b>state</b> [...] "reverse charges" [...] the VAT. This means that the importer is required to pay VAT to the <b>importing</b> <b>member</b> <b>state</b> at its rate. In many cases a credit is immediately given for this as input VAT.

The study used the relative measure of trade intensity to measure the exports and <b>imports</b> shares within <b>member</b> <b>states</b> and gravity model to identify factors affecting intra-SADC trade flows. The results from relative measure of trade intensity indicated that although the intra-SADC trade remains low, but figures appear to increase compared to the previous recorded facts. The analysis indicates that the share of intra-SADC exports averaged to 31. 3 percent between 2008 and 2012. More specifically, Swaziland and Zimbabwe have the highest share of their total exports, while Seychelles has the smallest share of exports to SADC <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> Meanwhile, the share of intra-SADC imports averaged to 35. 0 percent between 2008 and 2012 from which Lesotho and Zimbabwe had the largest share of their total imports, while South Africa has the smallest share within the region. It was found that South Africa has a comparative advantage in trade, receiving the largest share of exports and <b>imports</b> from other <b>member</b> <b>states</b> within the region. Generally, findings indicated that most SADC <b>member</b> <b>states</b> appear to trade more with other countries outside the SADC region.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to reconcile the}} principle of assimilation with the principle of mutual recognition with respect to third country goods entering the EU. It argues that third country goods in free circulation should benefit from the principle of mutual recognition when <b>imported</b> into other <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> if those goods are marketable {{in any one of}} the <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> Following the principle of assimilation, such goods should be able to rely on Article 34 TFEU "without distinction" between goods of EU origin and third country origin. Mutual recognition, on the other hand, allows traders to challenge indistinctly applicable product rules if goods are "lawfully produced and marketed in another Member State". This article assesses four different ways of reconciling these two principles. The article argues that the preferred option is to allow goods in free circulation that are "lawfully marketable" in another <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> to benefit from the presumption of equivalence that follows from mutual recognition when those goods are <b>imported</b> into another <b>Member</b> <b>State.</b> This is the least trade restrictive way to achieve the fundamental purpose of mutual recognition: subjecting goods within the EU internal market, as much as possible, to only one set of technical regulations, not two or zero. If goods of third country origin can be marketed in one <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> according its technical rules, those goods should be presumed to meet equivalent standards set by the <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> of importation. The burden of proof should be on the <b>Member</b> <b>State</b> seeking to apply its technical rules to the imported products in question to demonstrate their necessityin light of public interest requirements...|$|R

To achieve the objective of the study, available data for a sample size of 18 OIC members over the period (1970 - 2006) were collected and considered for estimation purposes. The study employed panel analysis approach {{to estimate the}} determinants of intra-trade of OIC members, in the framework of static analysis using the pooled least squares models, fixed-effects and random models. As for dynamic analysis, Mean Group Estimator (MGE) and Pooled Mean Group Estimator (PMGE) were used for estimation. In estimation, the study used macro variables like gross intra-trade (intra-export and <b>import</b> amongst <b>member</b> <b>states)</b> as a dependent variable and inflation rate, volatility of exchange rate, GDP, export to {{rest of the world and}} import from the world as independent variables. All mode variables were found individually integrated of order one as well as cointegrated.

The model also indicated that the intra-trade of OIC members adjusts towards long run equilibrium by (16. 23 %) in every period of time. The speed of adjustment was found to take 6 years of time to equilibrium value. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the causes behind why England and Sweden, as European Union (EU) <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> that share a higher concern for animal welfare, suffer similar financial drawbacks and {{a decrease of}} their farmers’ competitive strength, {{in spite of their}} fundamentally different regulatory approaches to transposing EU law. This complex situation is investigated by tracing the issue to its origin: the inherent tension stemming from the dual classification of the animals in EU primary law as both sentient beings and tradable goods. Farm animal welfare is regulated by minimum harmonising EU Directives, which permit <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> to implement stricter domestic regulatory standards. This thesis argues that these stricter standards, while being zoocentrically important in terms of enabling a higher level of farm animal welfare, also have a substantial negative economic impact upon the affected farmers, due to the higher input costs. The issue arising is that minimum Directives effectively negate the competitive strength of the farmers in ‘stricter’ <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> as their domestic produce competes directly against <b>imported</b> products from <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> whose national legislation is closer to the minimum standard established by the EU Directives. This thesis critiques this situation as untenable and submits that the farmers’ competitive strength in stricter <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> can be improved by a shift in consumer purchasing behaviour, achieved by a programme that raises public awareness. The research outcome is a recommendation of the introduction of an EU-wide farm animal welfare labelling policy, one that would allow consumers to distinguish high-welfare products from low-welfare ones, where the elevated price commanded by the former would offset the higher costs incurred in their production. The benefits of this solution are that it facilitates increased competitiveness within the EU’s internal market, while maintaining and promoting higher farm animal welfare standards...|$|R

To disentangle the true equilibrium elasticities SURE system error correction models (SSECM) are estimated for nominal exchange rate changes versus {{the rest of the world}} or other major currencies. To differentiate between price level changes and changes of the nominal exchange rate, a country's export and import equation is estimated using separately the nominal rate and the relative price/ unit labor cost as regressors. Results of Wald-tests indicate that assuming both variables to have the same influence on exports and imports is misleading. Whether the relative price/ unit labor costs elasticities are high or low depends crucially on which indicator is chosen, while the effect of nominal exchange rate changes can be estimated robustly for all countries in the sample. Especially France and Spain are hit by a Euro appreciation since their exports are highly exchange rate elastic. However, for France, this effect is at least partly offset by an also negative exchange rate elasticity of imports...|$|R

40|$|The {{international}} trade in plants for planting (P 4 Ps) is a major pathway for the introduction of plant pests. The global trade in P 4 Ps is both voluminous and highly diverse, {{but there is little}} detailed knowledge about its diversity and dynamics. This makes it difficult to assess the risks associated with this trade and to prioritise high-risk commodities (genus-origin combinations) for detailed inspection or regulation. Using the ISEFOR database, this paper describes the diversity and dynamics of P 4 P imports into the EU, based on genus-level data for lots <b>imported</b> into fourteen <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> that provided this data for different periods between 2005 and 2014, totalling over 30 Bn plants and over 7500 commodities. There was great variety, as well as complementarity, in terms of the imported genera, origins and commodities among the countries. Two-thirds of the imported commodities changed every year. Based on the 10 -year data from the Netherlands, the greatest importer of live plants in the dataset, we developed a risk categorisation approach for prioritising the highest risk commodities, based on risk associated information concerning the imported genus and the history of trade with respect to the exporting countries, genera and type of plant material traded. Application of this risk categorisation led to the identification of a modest number of commodities that represent elevated risk, to which more inspection resources can be allocated while lower-risk commodities could be subject to less-intensive phytosanitary inspections. </p...|$|R
