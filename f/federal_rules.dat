The first filing was by the family of Keith A. Gabel, which filed a motion to perpetuate testimony in the Central District of California on June 16, 1971. This motion requests that the court issue a court order for a person's deposition to be taken, and can be done prior to a lawsuit being filed under the <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> of Civil Procedure.|$|E

40|$|This article {{looks at}} {{significant}} differences between <b>Federal</b> <b>Rule</b> of Civil Procedure 23 on class actions and the class-action rules or statutes of some states and foreign nations. A large number of American states have class-action rules based on and often identical with <b>Federal</b> <b>Rule</b> 23, at least in its 1966 version before amendments of the last ten years. But important variations exist and might provide a source of ideas for revisions of the <b>federal</b> <b>rule</b> and other state rules. Three of the most noteworthy are: First, a few states {{do not have the}} typicality requirement of <b>Federal</b> <b>Rule</b> 23 (a) (3). Second and more significantly, several states and foreign jurisdictions do not apply the requirement of <b>Federal</b> <b>Rule</b> 23 (b) (3) that common issues predominate over individual ones with the zeal of some federal courts, or lack the requirement to begin with. Third, in a considerable variety of ways several states water down the rigorous requirement of <b>Federal</b> <b>Rule</b> 23 (c) (2) (B) that for Rule 23 (b) (3) common-question class actions 2 ̆ 2 the court must direct to class members the best notice that is practicable under the circumstances, including individual notice to all members who can be identified through reasonable effort. 2 ̆...|$|R

5|$|The 1996 Maryland train {{collision}} {{occurred on}} February 16, 1996, when a MARC commuter train collided with Amtrak's Capitol Limited passenger train in Silver Spring, Maryland. An {{investigation by the}} National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that {{the crew of the}} MARC train had forgotten the indication of an approach signal which they had passed before a station stop, and as a consequence could not slow down in time after encountering a stop signal. The collision killed three crew and eight passengers on the MARC train; a further eleven passengers on the MARC train and fifteen passengers and crew on the Capitol Limited were injured. Total damage was estimated at $7.5 million. The crash {{led to the creation of}} comprehensive <b>federal</b> <b>rules</b> for passenger car design, the first in the history of passenger service in the United States, as well as changes to operating rules.|$|E
5|$|Ryan's budget plans {{proposed}} privatizing Medicare {{for those}} {{under the age}} of 55, and funding Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program through block grants to the states. In 2012 Ryan proposed that Medicaid be converted into block grants, but with the federal government's share of the cost cut by some $800 billion over the next decade. Currently, Medicaid is administered by the states, subject to <b>federal</b> <b>rules</b> concerning eligibility, and the amount paid by the federal government depends on {{the number of people who}} qualify. His plan would have undone a Reagan-era reform by which the federal government prohibited the states from requiring that a patient's spouse, as well as the patient, deplete all of his or her assets before Medicaid would cover long-term care. Ryan’s budget plan proposed raising the Medicare eligibility age, beginning in 2023, by two months a year, until it reached 67 in 2034. A 2011 analysis, conducted by the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research group, for the Kaiser Family Foundation, estimated that Ryan's 2011 plan would have resulted in 14 million to 27 million fewer people receiving Medicaid coverage by 2021.|$|E

25|$|Garner {{has contributed}} to the field of {{procedural}} rules. From 1992 to 1994, he revised all amendments to the sets of Federal Rules—Civil, Appellate, Evidence, Bankruptcy, and Criminal—for the United States Judicial Conference. In the mid-1990s, he restyled the <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> of Appellate Procedure and the <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> of Criminal Procedure, which were adopted by the Judicial Conference, then by the United States Supreme Court, and enacted by Congress. The <b>Federal</b> <b>Rules</b> of Civil Procedure were restyled in 1993–1994 and adopted on December 1, 2007. The Administrative Office of the United States Courts has printed and distributed Garner's booklet Guidelines for Drafting and Editing Court Rules (1st ed. 1996, 5th ed. 2007). Garner has revised the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure, the California Rules of Appellate Procedure, the California Judicial Council Rules, the Local Rules of the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, and the Rules on Judicial-Conduct and Disability Proceedings (for federal courts). In 2015, after a 15-year hiatus, he returned as a style consultant to the U.S. Judicial Conference's Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure.|$|E
