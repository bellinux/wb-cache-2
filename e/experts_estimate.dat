5|$|<b>Experts</b> <b>estimate</b> {{that with}} the {{accession}} of Armenia, the internationally unrecognised Nagorno-Karabakh Republic would not {{be integrated into the}} Eurasian Union. Armenia is a permanent political, military and economic ally of Russia, whereas Azerbaijan holds close ties with the west. The Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev expressed concern in 2013 that no reliable customs border between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh could be drawn. However, Nazarbayev expressed that he holds all the existing disagreements preventing Armenia's integration into Eurasian Economic Union are surmountable. The Chairman of the Foreign Policy Committee in the Armenian Parliament, Artak Zakarian, announced on 14 May 2014 that Armenia will build no customs border including the region of Nagorno-Karabakh.|$|E
5|$|Haynes {{was offered}} a higher ranking {{position}} within Indiana Gas at the Chicago headquarters, but by then he had {{become aware of the}} business's connection to the corrupt and disgraced monopolist Charles T. Yerkes. A deeply religious man who feared involvement in any corruption, Haynes entertained the offer only briefly; Bertha's advice to refuse the position persuaded him and he declined the offer and instead sought a position more removed from the company's Chicago leadership. After the pipeline became fully operational in 1892, Haynes moved to Kokomo where he was made a supervisor of the Indiana Gas's local operations. The Indiana General Assembly began attempts to regulate the gas industry and accused the field operations of various companies of gross waste; Indiana Gas became the primary target of scathing reports. Haynes helped the company compile reports and offered opinions on the validity of their claims. He was disturbed to find that many of the claims proved true, and advocated that the gas be used more conservatively. He specifically recommended that the flambeaus (the flames fed by natural gas to show that the gas was flowing) be extinguished, as they were found to be the largest source of waste. He calculated that the company daily wasted $10,000 ($ in 2009 chained dollars) worth of gas by burning flambeaus, a figure that shocked the company's leaders. Despite his support of the governmental anti-waste regulations, he was steadfastly against other rules that regulated pressure and hindered productivity. He personally filed lawsuits against the regulations a month after their passage, claiming that the government had no right to regulate artificial increases in well pressure. The court case continued until 1896, when the Indiana Supreme Court ruled that the regulations were unconstitutional. The entire set of regulations was repealed, including the anti-waste measures. The gross waste continued among other companies and the field's wells began to run dry by 1905modern <b>experts</b> <b>estimate</b> as much as 90% of the one trillion cubic feet (30km3) of natural gas in the field was lost into the atmosphere or misused.|$|E

40|$|This chapter proposes an {{approach}} to the combination of forecasts from a new perspective and uses a new estimation methodology. Concepts from optimization and statistics are combined in order to cast the problem as one of estimating the minimizer of a loss function, which {{is assumed to be}} not explicitly known. Using weak assumptions on the unknown loss function, and on the performance distribution of the experts, a density for the <b>expert</b> <b>estimates</b> may be derived. Sufficient conditions are then obtained for reducing the problem to that of statistical mode estimation. By regarding individual forecasts as <b>expert</b> <b>estimates</b> of the minimizer of the decision maker's loss function, the mode of these forecasts becomes a combination forecast. Using the Bayesi{{an approach}} and the Markov chain Monte Carlo method, an empirical distribution corresponding to the predictive density of the <b>expert</b> <b>estimates</b> can be constructed. Hence the mode can be estimated and a probability interval for the forecast value can also be obtained. The probability interval associated with a combination forecast has not previously been studied in the literature. Thus, the construction of the probability interval is a new contribution. Simulation studies as well as an empirical example are presented to illustrate our method. Department of Applied Mathematic...|$|R
