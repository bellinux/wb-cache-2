5|$|Although Monroe {{had become}} one of 20th Century-Fox's biggest stars, her {{contract}} had not changed since 1950, meaning that she was paid far less than other stars of her stature and could not choose her projects or co-workers. She was also tired of being typecast, and her attempts to appear in films other than comedies or musicals had been thwarted by Zanuck, who had a strong personal dislike of her and did not think she would earn the studio as much revenue in dramas. When she refused to begin shooting yet another musical comedy, a film version of The Girl <b>in</b> <b>Pink</b> Tights, which was to co-star Frank Sinatra, the studio suspended her on January 4, 1954.|$|E
5|$|Gotcha was {{designed}} by Allan Alcorn, the designer of Pong, and a prototype was constructed by Cyan Engineering, Atari's semi-independent research and development subsidiary. Development began in July 1973 as part of Atari's strategy to develop multiple types of games to separate themselves from their competitors, who they saw as focused primarily on creating Pong clones. The cabinet {{was designed}} by George Faraco, initially with the joysticks encased <b>in</b> <b>pink</b> domes meant to represent breasts. Although this design inspired the advertising flyer on which it appears behind a man chasing {{a woman in a}} nightdress, it was changed to use regular joysticks soon after release.|$|E
5|$|Juventus {{have played}} {{in black and white}} striped shirts, with white shorts, {{sometimes}} black shorts since 1903. Originally, they played <b>in</b> <b>pink</b> shirts with a black tie. The father of one of the players made the earliest shirts, but continual washing faded the colour so much that in 1903 the club sought to replace them. Juventus asked one of their team members, Englishman John Savage, if he had any contacts in England who could supply new shirts in a colour that would better withstand the elements. He had a friend who lived in Nottingham, who being a Notts County supporter, shipped out the black and white striped shirts to Turin. Juventus have worn the shirts ever since, considering the colours to be aggressive and powerful.|$|E

She appeared frequently in the sketch comedy The Tim Conway Show from 1980 to 1981, and did voice acting for a few animated films and television shows. Roswell also performed in some theater plays, including one in 1988 directed by Julia Sweeney.|$|E
5|$|On the January 2 {{episode of}} Raw, the Ladies <b>in</b> <b>Pink</b> turned their {{attention}} to backstage announcer Maria Kanellis, blaming her for Victoria's loss in a match. Victoria announced to Maria that they had a match scheduled that night and proceeded to attack her before the bell. Although Victoria seemed to have the advantage in the match, which included interference from Wilson and Chloe, Victoria was pinned after she attempted an offensive maneuver but missed and ran into the turnbuckle, allowing Maria to pin her. After the match, Candice Michelle, Wilson, and Victoria attacked Maria until Ashley Massaro ran down to the ring to assist Maria. The conflict between the Divas caused the Chairman, Vince McMahon, to make a Bra and Panties Gauntlet match at New Year's Revolution, which Massaro won when she eliminated Victoria by removing her shorts. The next night on Raw, the Ladies <b>in</b> <b>Pink</b> announced that they had changed the name of their alliance to Vince's Devils. The storyline rivalry with Massaro continued on the January 23 episode of Raw, when Victoria and Candice Michelle were defeated by Trish Stratus and Massaro in a tag team match. At the Royal Rumble on January 30, the three women were shown in backstage segments flirting with McMahon.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of polonium {{is similar to}} that of tellurium, although it also shows some similarities to its neighbor bismuth due to its metallic character. Polonium dissolves readily in dilute acids but is only slightly soluble in alkalis. Polonium solutions are first colored <b>in</b> <b>pink</b> by the Po2+ ions, but then rapidly become yellow because alpha radiation from polonium ionizes the solvent and converts Po2+ into Po4+. This process is accompanied by bubbling and emission of heat and light by glassware due to the absorbed alpha particles; as a result, polonium solutions are volatile and will evaporate within days unless sealed. At pH about 1, polonium ions are readily hydrolyzed and complexed by acids such as oxalic acid, citric acid, and tartaric acid.|$|E

5|$|When Harry Dean Stanton {{auditioned for}} Brett, he told Ridley Scott {{he was not}} a fan of science-fiction or horror films; Scott replied that he was not either, but {{expected}} Alien to do well. According to Stanton, he was pleased with the film and said it and Pretty <b>in</b> <b>Pink</b> are the films for which he is best recognized. Several of Brett's scenes were deleted from the original cut, including Ripley and Parker seeing his death and his cocooned corpse in the Alien's lair; they were included in the 2003 director's cut. According to writer Dan O'Bannon, the latter scene hinted that Brett's body was becoming an Alien incubator.|$|E

5|$|Between 1905 and 1981 the Albert Bridge {{was painted}} uniformly green; in 1981 it was repainted yellow. In 1992 it was redecorated and rewired. Partially as a result, {{it is now}} a major West London landmark. The bridge is painted <b>in</b> <b>pink,</b> blue and green to {{increase}} visibility in fog and murky light and thus to reduce the risks of ships colliding with the fragile structure during the day. At night, a network of 4,000 low-voltage tungsten-halogen bulbs illuminate the bridge. In 1993 the innovative use of long-life low-energy lighting was commended by Mary Archer, at the time Chairwoman of the National Energy Foundation. Its distinctive and striking current appearance has led to its use as a backdrop for numerous films set in the Chelsea area, such as A Clockwork Orange, Absolute Beginners, Sliding Doors and Maybe Baby.|$|E
5|$|Chris Carter {{also enjoyed}} and found {{inspiration}} <b>in</b> <b>Pink</b> Floyd and Tangerine Dream. Boyd Rice {{was influenced by}} the music of 60's girl groups and tiki culture. Z'EV cited Christopher Tree (Spontaneous Sound), John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Tim Buckley, Jimi Hendrix, and Captain Beefheart, among others together with Tibetan, Balinese, Javanese, Indian, and African music as influential in his artistic life. Cabaret Voltaire cited Roxy Music as their initial forerunners, as well as Kraftwerk's Trans-Europe Express. Cabaret Voltaire also recorded pieces reminiscent of musique concrète and composers such as Morton Subotnick. Nurse with Wound cited a long list of obscure free improvisation and Krautrock as recommended listening. 23 Skidoo borrowed from Fela Kuti and Miles Davis's On the Corner. Many industrial groups, including Einstürzende Neubauten, took inspiration from world music.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of the {{cockatoos}} is less brightly coloured {{than that}} of the other parrots, with species generally being either black, grey or white. Many species have smaller areas of colour on their plumage, often yellow, pink and red, usually on the crest or tail. The galah and Major Mitchell's cockatoo are more broadly coloured <b>in</b> <b>pink</b> tones. Several species have a brightly coloured bare area around the eye and face known as a periophthalmic ring; the large red patch of bare skin of the palm cockatoo is the most extensive and covers some of the face, while it is more restricted in some other species of white cockatoo, notably the corellas and blue-eyed cockatoo. The plumage of males and females is similar in most species. The plumage of the female cockatiel is duller than the male, but the most marked sexual dimorphism occurs in the gang-gang cockatoo and the two species of black cockatoos in the subgenus Calyptorhynchus, namely the red-tailed and glossy black cockatoos. The iris colour differs in a few species, being pink or red in the female galah and Major Mitchell's cockatoo and red-brown in some other female white cockatoo species. The males all have dark brown irises.|$|E

5|$|They were {{obliged to}} record their first album at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London, overseen by {{producer}} Norman Smith, a central figure <b>in</b> <b>Pink</b> Floyd's negotiations with EMI. Balance engineer Pete Bown, who had mentored Smith, helped ensure that the album had a unique sound, through his experimentation with equipment and recording techniques. Bown, assisted by studio manager David Harris, set up microphones {{an hour before the}} sessions began. Bown's microphone choices were mostly different from those used by Smith to record the Beatles' EMI sessions. Because of Barrett's quiet voice, he was placed in a vocal isolation booth to sing his parts. Automatic double tracking (ADT) was used to add layers of echo to the vocals and to some instruments. The album featured an unusually heavy use of echo and reverberation to give it its own unique sound. Much of the reverberation effect came from a set of Elektro-Mess-Technik plate reverberators– customised EMT 140s containing thin metal plates under tension– and the studio's tiled echo chamber built in 1931.|$|E
5|$|Waters' primary {{instrument}} <b>in</b> <b>Pink</b> Floyd was {{the electric}} bass guitar. He briefly played a Höfner bass but {{replaced it with}} a Rickenbacker RM-1999/4001S, until 1970 when it was stolen {{along with the rest of}} the band's equipment in New Orleans. He began using Fender Precision Basses in 1968, originally alongside the Rickenbacker 4001, and then exclusively after the Rickenbacker was lost in 1970. First seen at a concert in Hyde Park, London in July 1970, the black P-Bass was rarely used until April 1972 when it became his main stage guitar and as of 2 October 2010, the basis for a Fender Artist Signature model. Waters endorses RotoSound Jazz Bass 77 flat-wound strings. Throughout his career he has used Selmer, WEM, Hiwatt and Ashdown amplifiers but has used Ampeg for the last few tours, also employing delay, tremolo, chorus, stereo panning and phaser effects in his bass playing.|$|E
5|$|The club crest depicts an ox above a {{representation}} of a ford to symbolise the location. It reflects the name {{and history of the}} city, as Oxford was originally a market town situated near to a ford on the River Isis, which was used by cattle. In 2008, a bronze statue of an ox was unveiled outside of what would have been the west stand. It was subsequently vandalised in January 2011, being covered <b>in</b> <b>pink</b> paint and the club used the opportunity to raise money for a breast cancer charity. The shape and design of the crest has changed numerous times since it was first produced. When playing as Headington and {{during the early years of}} Oxford United, the crest included a full ox crossing the ford, as well as the initials H.U.F.C. (pre-1962) or the name Oxford United (post name-change). Between 1972 and 1980, the crest became circular, showing just the ox's head on a yellow and black background. The words 'Oxford United Football Club' were placed around the ox. For the next 17 years, the crest was simply the ox's head coloured blue, with various combinations of wording surrounding it. For example, in the 1987–88 season, the wording 25th Anniversary was placed under the crest. In 1996, the crest had a shield shape and contained the ox's head over the ford, on a yellow background. This version was retained until the move to the Kassam Stadium in 2001, when club steward Rob Alderman designed the current version. It has a similar design to the preceding crest, but the ox and ford are contained in a circle with a yellow background, with the remainder of the crest being coloured blue.|$|E
