Although <b>the</b> <b>investments</b> made under <b>the</b> scheme, contributed to the significant reorganization of the farms as well as to employment creation, serious deficiencies were detected in the way the scheme has been designed and implemented: lack of programming logic serving specific targets and of suitable mechanisms for information and back-up of farmers on technico-organizational matters, as well as non-incorporation of the principles of programming, monitoring and assessment. The way the scheme was implemented, exemplifies the subventionist logic of income assistance, and underlines some standing characteristics in Greek agricultural policy.

40|$|With {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of solar cells in Sweden, real estate companies have become interested in the possibility of installing solar panels when constructing new apartment buildings. Riksbyggen is one of these companies that sees solar energy as an interesting alternative when constructing energy-efficient buildings with low energy consumption. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate optimal system solutions and the profitability of a PV-system in a newly produced apartment building containing 28 apartments in Västerås. This investigation is made possible by creating and simulating the PV-system in the simulation program PVSyst. The PV-system that will be installed on Brf. Sjökortet has an installed capacity of 54 kW. 40 kW will be placed on the roof with a tilt of 4 ° while 14 kW will be placed on the facade with a tilt of 90 °. According the simulation results, the PV-system will produce 43, 6 MWh per year, which means the specific electricity production becomes 807 kWh/kWp. Own use of solar electricity is estimated to be 61 %, which means that 26, 7 MWh will be utilized directly by the housing association, while 16, 9 MWh must be submitted for sale. Out of the solar electricity that can be used directly 9, 9 MWh will cover the property electricity meanwhile the remaining 16, 8 MWh covers the residents household electricity. The residents of the housing cooperative will thus gain access to a large portion of the produced solar electricity without having to pay for it. The PV-system will without <b>investment</b> <b>aid</b> become unprofitable with an annuity of – 16 304 SEK per year. When <b>the</b> <b>investment</b> <b>aid</b> covering 35 % of <b>the</b> <b>investment</b> cost is included, the PV-system becomes profitable with an annuity of 2 687 SEK per year. The own use of solar electricity is difficult to improve by only changing the tilt of the solar panels. However, the results shows that a greater amount of solar electricity can be utilized by the housing cooperative in the winter months by increasing the amount of solar panels on the facade while decreasing the amount of solar panels on the roof with the same amount. A higher amount of solar panels on the facade will though decrease the yearly solar electricity production, making it more difficult for the PV-system to show profitability. The determined distribution of solar modules on the roof and facade is optimally distributed if the goal for the housing association is to utilize as much solar electricity as possible directly...|$|R

Such questions make effective evaluation of professional development programs more important than ever. Traditionally, educators haven't paid much attention to evaluating their professional development efforts. Many consider evaluation a costly, time-consuming process that diverts attention from more important activities such as planning, implementation, and follow-up. Others feel they lack the skill and expertise to become involved in rigorous evaluations; as a result, they either neglect evaluation issues completely or leave them to "evaluation experts. "...|$|R

The main objectives of the environmental legislation originating from extended producer responsibility (EPR) principle are to lead producers to undertake recovery initiatives for their end-of-use products and to promote environmentally desirable product design. It is still controversial whether current implementations of EPR principle are effective in attaining these objectives. This study seeks to answer the following questions: (1) What is the impact of EPR legislation on the product recovery decisions of producers? (2) How <b>do</b> <b>the</b> redesign opportunities (i. e., design for disassembly) affect the willingness of producers for product recovery? (3) How <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>investment</b> needs to start recovery practices and the reluctance of producers to allocate sufficient funds for this purpose affect the optimal recovery decisions? We use stylized economic models to represent the implementation in practice and solving our models we obtain closed form and numerical solutions that help us to see the impact of various parameters on the optimal decisions of a producer. Our findings indicate that redesign opportunities encourage producers for more recovery, however the reluctance of producers to cover <b>the</b> initial <b>investments</b> may substantially reduce the effectiveness of the legislation and the recovery amounts.

How <b>did</b> <b>the</b> wage-earners' <b>investment</b> funds stand to this traditional tension? How did Olof Palme remain to it? The answers to these questions are, that Olof Palme was very aware of this tension and he warned the trade union to be too radical. The proposal had a more reformistic formation when it was transmitted from the movement socialistic pole to the state socialistic pole. How <b>did</b> <b>the</b> wage-earners' <b>investment</b> funds fit in democratic socialism?
