40|$|Driven by {{globalization}} and increased financial integration, {{the last decade}} has seen many foreign banks entering <b>developing</b> <b>countries.</b> Although the majority of these banks are from high-income countries, recently banks from <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> have followed suit. This paper looks at this phenomenon, by examining the differences and similarities between <b>developing</b> and high-income <b>country</b> foreign banks. Using a large dataset on banking sector FDI in <b>developing</b> <b>countries,</b> we find that 27 percent of all foreign banks in <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> are owned by a bank from another <b>developing</b> <b>country,</b> while these banks hold 5 percent of the foreign assets. The importance of <b>developing</b> <b>country</b> foreign banks is much larger in low-income countries (both in number of banks and in terms of assets) and this type of foreign banking is strongly regionally concentrated. Although foreign bank entry by both <b>developing</b> <b>country</b> as well as high-income country banks seems to be driven by economic integration, common language and proximity, banks from <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> are more likely to invest in small <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> with weak institutions where high-income country banks are reluctant to go. This result seems to suggest that <b>developing</b> <b>country</b> banks have a competitive advantage dealing with countries with a weak institutional climate. Furthermore, our results indicate that <b>developing</b> <b>country</b> foreign banks have a higher interest margin and are less profitable than foreign banks from high-income countries...|$|R

Schistosomiasis, caused by one genus of trematodes, is the second-most devastating of all human diseases caused by parasites, surpassed only by malaria. Neurocysticercosis, which arises when larvae of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium penetrate the central nervous system, is the major cause of acquired epilepsy worldwide. The threat of platyhelminth parasites to humans in <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> is rising because of the popularity of raw or lightly cooked foods, and imports of food from high-risk areas.

5|$|After World War II, {{the world}} {{split into two}} large geopolitical blocs, {{separating}} into spheres of communism and capitalism.

Today, the First World is slightly outdated and has no official definition, however, it is generally {{thought of as the}} capitalist, industrial, wealthy and <b>developed</b> <b>countries.</b> This definition includes Australia & New Zealand, the <b>developed</b> <b>countries</b> of Asia (South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore) and the wealthy countries of North America and Europe, particularly Western Europe. In contemporary society, the First World is viewed as countries that have the most advanced economies, the greatest influence, the highest standards of living, and the greatest technology. After the Cold War, these countries of the First World included member states of NATO, U.S.-aligned states, neutral countries that were developed and industrialized, and the former British Colonies that were considered developed.

The proportionate increase in South-South trade occurred despite relatively higher protection in most <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> against the products for which they, as a group, have a comparative advantage.
