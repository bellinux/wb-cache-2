500|$|Although not {{exceptional}} in size at , , Taylor was {{a physical}} fullback. He sought contact on every play, accordant with his philosophy: [...] "Football is a contact sport. You've {{got to make}} them respect you. You've got to punish tacklers. You've got to <b>deal</b> <b>out</b> more misery than the tacklers <b>deal</b> <b>out</b> to you." [...] He was widely acknowledged by his peers {{as one of the}} toughest and meanest players in the NFL. Former quarterback Bobby Layne listed him as one of the one of [...] "Pro Football's 11 Meanest Men" [...] in an article for SPORT magazine in 1964. Packers linebacker Ray Nitschke said, [...] "In 15 years with the pros, he's one of the toughest men I ever played against—and we were on the same team. He'd hurt you when you tackled him." [...] He was difficult to tackle, as he fought for every extra yard. Giants linebacker Sam Huff proposed a rule change specifically in Taylor's case; per NFL rules, piling-on after a play invokes an unnecessary roughness penalty, but Huff argued, [...] "You gotta pile on him a little to keep him down." ...|$|E

[...] Other {{prominent}} roles included Larry Drake as [...] "Jack Ferguson", Paul Carr as [...] "Elliot", Chris Douridas as [...] "Willy", and a special appearance by country music star Mickey Gilley as himself. [...] As with the previous presentation, this episode's direction was credited to Alan Smithee.|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the special}} effects used in the episode were created in a [...] "low-stress" [...] manner that did not rely wholly on Computer-generated imagery. During the {{childbirth}} scene, gas-burners were set a distance away from a fire-proof bed. The scene was then filmed with a long lens to give {{the effect that the}} fire was mere inches away from the bed. Producer John Shiban said that the film crew made [...] "a big <b>deal</b> <b>out</b> of the eyes" [...] to make the scene frightening. The devil sonogram was created by using the videotape of a real sonogram of a crew member's wife. The videotape was then edited to give it a demonic look.|$|E

500|$|The Undertaker was {{reportedly}} {{taken away from}} the Superdome in an ambulance, which WWE later confirmed was due to him suffering a [...] "severe concussion"; he was discharged the next day. In May 2014, Shawn Michaels said that Vince McMahon made the final decision to end the Undertaker's streak about four hours before WrestleMania XXX. McMahon confirmed in December 2014 that it was indeed him who made the final decision and that the Undertaker was initially shocked at the decision. The decision was made due to McMahon believing {{that it would make}} a huge <b>deal</b> <b>out</b> of Brock Lesnar to set up the next WrestleMania event. McMahon also said that he did not foresee other viable candidates on the roster to fill Lesnar's role within the near future.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Beyoncé {{and her husband}} saying a few words, {{including}} [...] "intimacy", [...] "honesty", and [...] "commitment", and then saying the words [...] "you", [...] "me", and [...] "us" [...] together. When the action starts, Beyoncé is seen working as a police officer. Her husband (played by NFL player Eddie Goines) is very supportive. He makes her breakfast, spends time at work looking for a present for her and forgoes socializing with attractive coworkers so he can be available when his wife arrives home. However, Beyoncé is not thinking about him at all. Instead, she spends her free time with other officers, particularly her male partner, whom she seems enamored with. Her husband calls her, but she ignores the phone. Later, when her husband gives her earrings, she puts them on to go dancing with her partner at a party. Her husband is upset when he sees them, and when he confronts her about this, she acts like he is making a big <b>deal</b> <b>out</b> of nothing. [...] "When you act like that, I don't think you realize how it makes me look or feel", he tells her. Beyoncé then asks him in a condescending tone, [...] "Why are you so jealous? It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy." [...] Then the story reverses, and Beyoncé starts to cry. Her husband's situation is actually her experience—he is a police officer who takes his supportive wife for granted.|$|E

What's more, they label the democratic forces as being inept, plotting to rise to power {{on the back of the}} nostalgia for the development-oriented dictatorships of the past." ...|$|E

2500|$|The city {{responded to}} the strike by ringing the city's alarm bell {{for the first time}} in its history; the Mayor ordered a company of the local militia to patrol the streets. The strikers responded with mass picketing. When mill owners turned fire hoses on the picketers {{gathered}} in front of the mills, they responded by throwing ice at the plants, breaking a number of windows. The court sentenced 24 workers to a year in jail for throwing ice; as the judge stated, [...] "The only way we can teach them is to <b>deal</b> <b>out</b> the severest sentences". Governor Eugene Foss then ordered out the state militia and state police. Mass arrests followed.|$|E
2500|$|The team {{originally}} used American football commentators, but we {{were asked}} to make [...] "everything more British," [...] so they hired English actor Hugh Dennis to perform the voice of Ralph and ex-footballer Ray Wilkins to perform the voice of Tony; Robinson recalled that Dennis' [...] "Eddie Waring-esque commentary" [...] was deliberately intended to contrasted with the [...] "dry and amusing delivery" [...] of Wilkins. Actors that were intended for the role of the Tango drinker were passed over as they did not like the idea of being slapped; the role ultimately went to an actor whose identity has not been discussed. Robinson praised him, saying that he was a [...] "really good actor, and he was just the best at reacting to being hit, he never made a big <b>deal</b> <b>out</b> of it," [...] calling his performance [...] "cool and dopey." ...|$|E

[...] Barack's response to the criticism was, [...] "Statements like this are made, and people try to take it out of context and make a great big <b>deal</b> <b>out</b> of it, and that isn't at all what she meant. What she meant was, this is the first time that she's been proud of the politics of America," [...] he said.

He holds that liberalism in the United States is aimed toward achieving [...] "equality {{of opportunity for}} all" [...] {{but it is the}} means of achieving this that changes depending on the circumstances. He says that the [...] "process of redefining liberalism in terms of the social needs of the 20th century was conducted by Theodore Roosevelt and his New Nationalism, Woodrow Wilson and his New Freedom, and Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New <b>Deal.</b> <b>Out</b> of these three reform periods there emerged the conception of a social welfare state, in which the national government had the express obligation to maintain high levels of employment in the economy, to supervise standards of life and labor, to regulate the methods of business competition, and to establish comprehensive patterns of social security." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{standard}} Set game, the dealer lays out {{cards on the}} table until either twelve are laid down or someone sees a set and calls [...] "Set!". The player who called [...] "Set" [...] takes the cards in the set, and the dealer continues to <b>deal</b> <b>out</b> cards until twelve are on the table. A player who sees a set among the twelve cards calls [...] "Set" [...] and takes the three cards, and the dealer lays three more {{cards on the table}}. (To call out [...] "set" [...] and not pick one up quickly enough results in a penalty.) It is possible that there is no set among the twelve cards; in this case, the dealer deals out three more cards to make fifteen dealt cards, or eighteen or more, as necessary. This process of dealing by threes and finding sets continues until the deck is exhausted and there are no more sets on the table. At this point, whoever has collected the most sets wins.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{a nucleus}} of young talent and high {{expectations}} for 1999–2000, injuries caused the Bruins to plummet {{to the bottom of}} their division, and they went on track to miss the playoffs. This was further exacerbated by negative attention over teammate Marty McSorley's hit on Donald Brashear. With his career nearing an end and the team going in the wrong direction, Bourque requested a trade from the fading Bruins so he would {{have a chance to win}} the Stanley Cup. Bourque wanted to be traded to a team on the East Coast such as the Philadelphia Flyers, and Flyers' general manager Bobby Clarke offered the Bruins Andy Delmore and Daymond Langkow for Bourque. Bruins general manager Harry Sinden badly wanted Bourque to have a chance to close out his career with a Cup win and decided to pursue a trade with the Colorado Avalanche instead. Doing his best to keep word of the <b>deal</b> <b>out</b> of the press, Sinden worked out the specifics of the deal and on March 6, 2000, Sinden told Bourque he would be traded to the Avalanche and said, [...] "this may not be your first choice, but this is the team I feel is best." [...] Bourque and fellow veteran Dave Andreychuk were sent to Colorado in exchange for Brian Rolston, Martin Grenier, Sammy Pahlsson, and a first-round draft pick (2000 draft, 27th overall, Martin Samuelsson).|$|E

2500|$|They {{left for}} UK on 15 May 1971, this time aboard the Fairstar and {{accompanied}} by Wheatley's girlfriend Alison, and Keays' wife Vicky and their baby son James. Unfortunately, {{by the time they}} arrived in the UK, almost three months had passed since Halsall's phone call and interest was waning. Resigning themselves to the inevitable, they contacted EMI and set up the promised new recording, for three months ahead. They employed an outside PR agent, Jim Haswell, who managed to get some small reviews for them, but Wheatley was unable to find an agency that would book them, and although Ford insisted on keeping up the regime of regular rehearsals, they had no live work. At this point a new UK label Bronze—who had just signed Slade and Uriah Heep—made an approach to the band to become their third act. Although the group was hesitant, being still signed to EMI, they decided to use the offer as leverage in hopes of getting a better <b>deal</b> <b>out</b> of EMI. Wheatley delivered an ultimatum to EMI Australia, demanding that they either release the band from their contract or match Bronze's offer of £90,000 (or $180,000 in Australia). Predictably, EMI did neither, responding with an advance of $1000. Fearing legal repercussions, the band ruefully declined Bronze's offer, Keays' later opined that the best course of action would have been to [...] "sign with Bronze and let the lawyers work it all out later." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ishiro Honda {{wanted the}} theme of the movie to be a satire of the Television {{industry}} in Japan. In April 1962, TV networks and their various sponsors started producing outrageous programming and publicity stunts to grab audiences attention after two elderly viewers reportedly died at home while watching a violent wrestling match on TV. The various rating wars between the networks and banal programming that followed this event caused widespread debate over how TV would effect Japanese culture with Soichi Oya stating TV was creating [...] "a nation of 100 million idiots". Honda stated [...] "People were making a big <b>deal</b> <b>out</b> of ratings, but my own view of TV shows was that they did not take the viewer seriously, that they took the audience for granted....so I decided to show that through my movie" [...] and [...] "the reason I showed the monster battle through the prism of a ratings war was to depict the reality of the times". Honda addressed this by having a pharmaceutical company sponsor a TV show and going to extremes for a publicity stunt for ratings by capturing a giant monster stating [...] "All a medicine company would have to do is just produce good medicines you know? But the company doesn't think that way. They think they will get ahead of their competitors if they use a monster to promote their product.". Honda would work with screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa on developing the story stating that [...] "Back then Sekizawa was working on pop songs and TV shows so he really had a clear insight into television".|$|E
