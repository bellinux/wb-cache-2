5|$|The fourth {{letter was}} written in {{response}} to the many charges put forth by the British supporters of Wood's patent against the Irish, including claims of papal influence and of treason. A large portion of the letter is a response to these accusations and to refuting further arguments that Wood's coin could be beneficial to the Irish people. The tone of the letter is clear: Wood's allies are promoting an <b>evil</b> <b>that</b> will harm Ireland. However, Wood is only a secondary target—figures like Walpole are mocked for their role in the controversy.|$|E
5|$|After {{penetrating}} Ganon, {{the four}} Links firmly seal him inside the Four Sword, bringing chaos and horror to an end. Peace returns to Hyrule, {{the souls of}} the knights are freed from their torment, and the people celebrate as all traces of <b>evil</b> <b>that</b> plagued Hyrule are vanquished. With Ganon defeated and sealed inside, Link returns the Four Sword that sealed darkness away back to its resting pedestal and the four Links become one again. After the battle, The Maidens of the Shrine use their powers and create a barrier, which is strong enough for the Four Sword to rest before the six maidens leave. Thus, Link's journey has ended and both he and Zelda leave the Sanctuary as Darkness fades away and Light endures in the Land of Hyrule, bringing peace and prosperity.|$|E
5|$|Ged spends {{many months}} healing before {{resuming}} his studies. The new Archmage, Gensher, describes the shadow as an ancient <b>evil</b> <b>that</b> wishes to possess Ged, and warns {{him that the}} creature has no name. Ged eventually receives his wizards' staff, and takes up residence in the Ninety Isles, providing the villagers protection from the dragons that live nearby on Pendor, but discovers that he is being pursued by the shadow creature. He sails to Pendor, and uses {{his knowledge of the}} dragon's true name to threaten him. The dragon offers to tell Ged the name of the shadow, but Ged instead extracts a promise that the dragon will never threaten the archipelago.|$|E

The weapon consists of four stones, containing the essences of the four classical elements, and a sarcophagus containing a fifth element {{in the form of}} a human, which combines the power of the other four elements into a divine light capable of defeating the evil. The Mondoshawans promise their human contact, a priest from a secret order, that they will come back with the weapon in time to stop the great evil when it returns.|$|E
5|$|Despite risking his own money, Kurosawa chose a {{story that}} was more {{directly}} critical of the Japanese business and political elites than any previous work. The Bad Sleep Well, based on a script by Kurosawa's nephew Mike Inoue, is a revenge drama about {{a young man who}} is able to infiltrate the hierarchy of a corrupt Japanese company with the intention of exposing the men responsible for his father's death. Its theme proved topical: while the film was in production, mass demonstrations were held against the new U.S.-Japan Security treaty, which was seen by many Japanese, particularly the young, as threatening the country's democracy by giving too much power to corporations and politicians. The film opened in September 1960 to positive critical reaction and modest box office success. The 25-minute opening sequence depicting a corporate wedding reception is widely regarded as one of Kurosawa's most skillfully executed set pieces, but the remainder of the film is often perceived as disappointing by comparison. The movie has also been criticized for employing the conventional Kurosawan hero to combat a social <b>evil</b> <b>that</b> cannot be resolved through the actions of individuals, however courageous or cunning.|$|E

Adi Shankara, for example, in his commentary on Brihadaranyaka Upanishad asserted that Devas represent the human seeking for the sacred and spiritual, while the Asuras represent the human seeking for the worldly excesses.

25|$|Slavery was a {{major cause}} of disunion. Although there were {{opposing}} views even in the Union States, most northern soldiers were largely indifferent on the subject of slavery, while Confederates fought the war, in large measure, to protect southern society, and slavery {{was an integral part of}} it. From the anti-slavery perspective, the issue was primarily about whether the system of slavery was an anachronistic <b>evil</b> <b>that</b> was incompatible with republicanism. The strategy of the anti-slavery forces was containment—to stop the expansion and thus put slavery on a path to gradual extinction. The slave-holding interests in the South denounced this strategy as infringing upon their Constitutional rights. Southern whites believed that the emancipation of slaves would destroy the South's economy, due to the large amount of capital invested in slaves and fears of integrating the ex-slave black population.|$|E

25|$|Michael {{enters his}} home and kills Debra. Later, Tommy, Kara, and Danny go to the {{boarding}} house, where Tommy reveals that he believes Michael has been inflicted with Thorn, an ancient Druid curse. Long ago, one child from each tribe, chosen to bear the curse of Thorn, must sacrifice its next of kin {{on the night of}} Samhain, or Halloween. Tommy believes that Steven will be Michael's final sacrifice. While Tommy goes out to look for Loomis, Mrs. Blankenship reveals to Kara that she was babysitting Michael the night he killed his sister, and that Danny is hearing a voice telling him to kill just like Michael did, indicating Danny also possesses the power of Thorn. Meanwhile, Michael kills John, Tim, Tim's girlfriend Beth, and Barry Simms. After Tommy returns home with Loomis, the Man in Black reveals himself to be Wynn. The cult take Kara, Danny, Steven, and Michael to Smith's Grove. There, Loomis confronts Wynn, who reveals he wants to control and study the power of Thorn. Wynn wants Loomis to join in on his conspiracy, and reveals that Jamie's baby represents a new cycle of Michael's <b>evil</b> <b>that</b> he kept secret from most of the cult who were focused on inflicting the curse onto a new child (Danny) to carry out a new trend of family sacrifices. Loomis calls Wynn out on his scheme and is knocked unconscious.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{a mysterious}} new witch comes into play, being {{revealed}} to be Crowley's mother, Rowena. Also, the angel Hannah goes back to Heaven so that her vessel can have her life back. A large focus of the season is Dean's quest to overcome the Mark of Cain and have it removed if possible. After the Mark causes him to break Charlie's arm, Sam suggests that Dean {{has the ability to}} at least partially control the Mark, but only if he can control himself. New hope for ridding Dean of the Mark comes when Charlie unearths the Book of the Damned. Sam needs help in reading and using this powerful tome, and turns to Rowena for help, keeping the entire thing a secret from Dean. He requests help from Charlie, too, who decodes the text but is murdered by the Steins, a family that has secretly controlled much of history. After massacring the Steins, nearly killing Castiel and getting another hunter killed, Dean starts despairing of being free of the Mark, causing him to turn to Death for help. Death proposes putting Dean in isolation away the Earth, but insists Dean must kill Sam, who otherwise would work to bring Dean back. Sam and Dean both agree that it is {{for the good of the}} world. At the last moment however, Dean seemingly kills Death instead to save Sam. Oblivious to the dangers, Rowena successfully casts the spell to remove the Mark and unleashes the Darkness, a primordial <b>evil</b> <b>that</b> had been kept away by the Mark. Rowena also places Castiel under a spell so he attacks Crowley as she escapes with the Book of the Damned.|$|E
