40|$|A major output {{nucleus of}} the basal ganglia is the substantia nigra pars reticulata, which sends GABAergic {{projections}} to brainstem and thalamic nuclei. The GABAergic (GABA) neurons are reciprocally connected with nearby dopaminergic neurons, which project mainly to the basal ganglia, a set of subcortical nuclei critical for goal-directed behaviors. Here we examined the impact of motivational states on the activity of GABA neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata and the neighboring dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the pars compacta. Both types of neurons show short-latency bursts to a cue predicting a food reward. As mice became sated by repeated consumption of food pellets, one class of neurons reduced cue-elicited firing, whereas another class of neurons progressively increased <b>firing.</b> <b>Extinction</b> or pre-feeding just before the test session dramatically reduced the phasic responses and their motivational modulation.

Simulated {{results show that the}} development of car fire in the underground car park can be classified into four stages; namely an initial stage, a developed stage, an extinction and re-burning stage and another fast-developed stage.

By using a computational fluid dynamics code with a detailed chemistry model for methane combustion, the authors have revealed the chemical kinetic structure of the stabilizing region of both jet and flat-plate diffusion flames, predicted the flame stability limit, and proposed diffusion flame attachment and detachment mechanisms in normal and microgravity. Because of the unique geometry of the edge of diffusion flames, radical back-diffusion against the oxygen-rich entrainment dramatically enhanced chain reactions, thus forming a peak reactivity spot, i. e., reaction kernel, responsible for flame holding. The new results have been obtained for the edge diffusion flame propagation and attached flame structure using various C 1 -C 3 hydrocarbons...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This work {{describes}} an experimental and theoretical inves-tigation of extinction limit of diesel pool fires suppressed by water mist. A downward-directed nozzle produced a fine water spray over small-scale opposed diesel pool fires. The <b>fire</b> <b>extinction</b> limit is obtained from minimum nozzle injection pressure or maximum fire size {{when the fire}} extinguishment took place. For the conditions tested, {{it is observed that}} there are two distinct regions in the relationship between the injection pressure and fire size, i. e., a fire suppression region and a fire intensification region. The transition of the two regions is dependent on the effective water flux and the plume-spray thrust ratio. It is also revealed that the fuel surface cooling is the dominant mechanism for diesel pool fires at extinction limit in the tests. The failure to cause <b>fire</b> <b>extinction</b> is mainly due to the insufficient water flux applied to remove enough heat from the fuel surface...|$|E
