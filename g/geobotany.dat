50|$|Helen L. Cannon (April 9, 1911 - October 20, 1996) was an American {{geologist}} specifying in <b>geobotany</b> {{and studying}} {{the effects of}} geological chemicals on the environment. She was a woman in science making large contributions to geology and advancements for in woman of science. She had a long lasting career at the United States Geological Survey in Washington, D.C. and Denver, Colorado soon becoming well known for her research and following discoveries. Cannon, along with two of her co-workers, set up and participated in the first organized unit studying chemicals in the real environment. The team concluded that by analyzing plants in a given area they could determine what metals {{were present in the}} soil and earth in that same area. In 1952, Cannon published a paper based on the findings and this paved the way for more research in geology and plants, <b>geobotany.</b> This research developed further into an important association with health and more specifically, cancer. As an author, she has been largely collected by libraries.|$|E
50|$|After the German reunification, Succow {{accepted}} a visiting professorship at the Technical University of Berlin. He then {{worked as a}} consultant {{for the state of}} Brandenburg as well as on an international level, for instance initiating seven National Parks in the country of Georgia. He was hired as a full university professor for <b>geobotany</b> and landscape ecology and director of the Department of Botany and the botanical garden of the University of Greifswald in 1992.|$|E
50|$|These expeditions {{were joined}} by many scientists, {{including}} botanists, such as the German explorer Alexander von Humboldt. Humboldt is often considered a father of ecology. He {{was the first to}} take on the study of the relationship between organisms and their environment. He exposed the existing relationships between observed plant species and climate, and described vegetation zones using latitude and altitude, a discipline now known as <b>geobotany.</b> Von Humboldt was accompanied on his expedition by the botanist Aimé Bonpland.|$|E
5000|$|Together with Boris Stefanoff he {{produced}} the [...] "Flora of Bulgaria" [...] (first issued in 1925 and repeatedly amended and republished), which lists 2,936 species of fern, gymnosperms and angiosperms. He {{found more than}} 400 plant taxa new to science, and established the beginning of research in <b>geobotany</b> and paleobotany in Bulgaria [...] He investigatd contemporary and historical plant geography of the Balkans and wrote papers on the vegetation of Pirin, Slavyanka, the Sofia Plain and the Danube islands.|$|E
5000|$|Yunnan University has {{from the}} very {{beginning}} attached great importance to the pursuit of scientific research, closely following international disciplines. It is, for example, a leader in ecology. Its Institute of Ecology and <b>Geobotany</b> has produced nationally utilized texts on plant community classification and plant ecology. ("Geobotany" [...] is a term from Russian and continental European science which entails classifying and analyzing the geographical distribution of the flora of a province or nation; it is called [...] "Phytogeography" [...] in English-speaking countries).|$|E
5000|$|... « The {{concept of}} {{itinerant}} students {{went back to}} earlier times when students throughout Europe would travel to other countries and institutions to complete their education in real situations rather than be restricted to dry home and university study ». But as the College was also conceived as an educational and research center, the Scottish Pavilion housed too the SIGMA (International Station of Mediterranean and Alpine <b>Geobotany)</b> laboratory founded by Josias Braun-Blanquet, the Swiss botanist settled in Montpellier after he submitted a dissertation on phytosociology supervised by Flahault.|$|E
5000|$|Phyto{{geography}} (from Greek φυτό, phyto = {{plant and}} γεωγραφία, [...] "geography" [...] meaning also distribution) or botanical geography is {{the branch of}} biogeography that {{is concerned with the}} geographic distribution of plant species and their influence on the earth's surface. Phytogeography is concerned with all aspects of plant distribution, from the controls on the distribution of individual species ranges (at both large and small scales, see species distribution) to the factors that govern the composition of entire communities and floras. <b>Geobotany,</b> by contrast, focuses on the geographic space's influence on plants.|$|E
50|$|After {{gymnasium}} school {{studies in}} Příbram, he studied botany at the Charles University in Prague, and graduated in 1906. Between 1911 and 1913 he published several important articles on Australian taxonomy. In 1916 {{he was named}} as professor of botany. Domin specialised in phytogeography, <b>geobotany</b> and plant taxonomy. He became a member at the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, published many scientific works and founded a botany institute at the university. The Domin scale, a commonly used means of classifying a standard area {{by the number of}} plant species found in that area, is named after him.|$|E
5000|$|Walter went on {{numerous}} research trips, {{on which he}} was most often accompanied by his wife, to almost all vegetation zones on the earth. He recorded his experiences and summarized his findings in many books. The sometimes very extensive works are often published in several editions, have been translated in part, and belong almost exclusively to the standard works of <b>Geobotany</b> and Ecology (review in his memoirs). Walter acquired extraordinary merits through the collaboration with Helmut Lieth in the published work [...] "Climate Chart World Atlas" [...] (1960-1967). This work was a clear form of climate representation and received the highest international recognition.|$|E
50|$|During {{her career}} as a {{scientist}} Cannon focused on the health effect that geochemical environments had, as well as <b>geobotany.</b> Cannon worked on many pieces in these subjects. One of works was on the method of using indicator plants to determine where uranium deposits might be. Hardier indicator plants that could withstand being in an environment with uranium were used to find out which locations were more likely to contain uranium in the ground. Uranium in an area could also be determined by looking at the chemical make up of certain plants to try at detect certain elements. This helped find new locations of uranium, specifically focusing on the Colorado Plateau.|$|E
50|$|A. R. Pinto da Silva {{was born}} in 1912 in the parish of Cedofeita at Porto. He {{graduated}} in agricultural engineering at Instituto Superior de Agronomia, Technical University of Lisbon in 1937. Married to biologist Quitéria of Jesus Gonçalves Pinto da Silva, they established Lisbon. In 1968 he became principal investigator at the National Agronomic Station, where he worked from 1937 to 1982, year of his retirement. Since its founding in 1939, he became head of the Phytosystematics and <b>Geobotany</b> departments, devoting himself to studies of flora and vegetation of mainland Portugal {{and also in the}} Azores. Besides the results of his activities, he sought to stimulate others in these and other fields of research, with considerable results.|$|E
50|$|After its {{relocation}} in 1907 to Dahlem {{the museum}} gained a considerably bigger exhibition space on three floors. These {{were used for}} expanding exhibitions about <b>geobotany</b> and paleobotany.After the destruction of buildings {{and a lot of}} exhibits the rebuilding started in 1957. At this time the museum had a surface area of only one floor. After the relocation of the herbarium and the library to the new east wing the museum could be expanded. On 11 March 1991 the second floor was introduced. In 2004/05 the first floor was reworked and redesigned.Now the museum is seen as an addition to the garden and presents the botanic topics which you cannot observe in the garden. To these belong the historical progress, the progress within a year, inner plant structures, enlarged micro-structures, spreading of species, plant products and the use of plants.|$|E
50|$|The {{faculty of}} biology {{began to develop}} in 1960, when Friedrich Oehlkers {{forwarded}} the ordinary of botany to Hans Mohr and Bernhard Hassenstein took the chair of Zoology as successor of Otto Koehler. Back then, the department of biology was still part of the Naturwissenschaftlich-Mathematische Fakultät (faculty of natural sciences and mathematics), which had been established in 1767. In 1963 and 1964, the “second generation” of ordinaries - Bresch (genetics), Drews (microbiology), Grisebach (biochemistry) and Sander (developmental biology of animals) - joined the founding fathers Mohr and Hassenstein. The “third generation” with the ordinaries Elster (limnology), Hertel (molecular biology), Osche (ecology and evolutionary biology of animals), Sitte (cellular biology), Spatz (biophysics) and the female professor Otti Wilmanns (<b>geobotany)</b> followed between 1967 and 1969. Within hardly one decade, the department of biology had become a subject with twelve fields, making {{the establishment of an}} “own” faculty in compliance with a new constitution of the university in the year of 1970 a logical consequence.|$|E
50|$|During {{his high}} school years in Ravensburg, Lang {{was one of the}} {{students}} of Karl Bertsch. He started his studies on botany and zoology with minors in chemistry and physics at the University of Freiburg in 1946 and changed to the University of Göttingen where he received the PhD degree in 1952 for his study on the late-glacial history of the vegetation and flora of southwestern Germany, supervised by Franz Firbas. Between 1952 and 1975 Lang worked at the Landessammlungen für Naturkunde (today: Staatliches Museum für Naturkunde) in Karlsruhe as curator and as deputy director of the museum. In 1962 Lang became lecturer in <b>Geobotany</b> at the University of Karlsruhe and in 1966 he submitted his habilitation thesis on the macrophyte vegetation of Lake Constance. Karlsruhe University appointed him professor at the Botanical Institute in 1972. In 1975 he was appointed full professor and director of the Systematisch-Geobotanisches Institut and Bern Botanical Garden, University of Bern, Switzerland, succeeding Max Welten. In 1989, after Lang’s retirement and becoming professor emeritus he moved back to southern Germany, the region where he grew up.|$|E
50|$|The {{reserves}} {{originated with}} the Polish army officer and amateur naturalist Ludwik Młokosiewicz, who established a regimental {{park at the}} settlement of Lagodekhi while stationed with the garrison there. After resigning from the army out of pacifism in 1861, he was ultimately arrested on returning to Tiflis and sent back to Poland, but returned in 1867 and {{spent the rest of}} his life living with his family on a cottage farm in the forest, studying the flora and fauna of the area as Inspector of Forests for the Signakhi District. He discovered more than 60 species and supplied specimens to collections in other countries. Beginning in 1889, Młokosiewicz urged that the area be protected, but this did not occur until 1912, after advocacy by the Imperial Russian Geographical Society and by Nikolai Ivanovich Kuznetsov, a professor of <b>geobotany</b> at the University of Dorpat (now Tartu). In response to his report and the society's urging that the forest no longer be used for firewood, the Tsar's viceregent in the Caucasus region accepted the application for a strict nature reserve, the first reserve to be established in the Caucasus region.|$|E
5000|$|The {{history of}} the University begin in 27 of May 1779 when the Decree of the Governing Senate {{established}} the land survey school. Founder of the school is Sergey Ivanovich Rozhnov. In 1819, the land survey school was renamed the Konstantinovoye land survey school, and in 1835 - the Constantine Land Institute. In 1849 the Konstantinovsky land surveying institute received {{the right of a}} first-rate university and was transferred to the position of a military institution that existed before 1867. During the period from 1835 to 1917, the Institute trained more than 2,000 specialists, including about 1500 surveying engineers. In 1945 the Moscow Land Management Institute was renamed the Moscow Institute of Land Use Engineers (MIIS). The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR for the merits in the training of highly qualified personnel for agriculture, a significant contribution to the development of science and practice of land management and in connection with the 200th anniversary of the founding of the Moscow Institute of Land Use Engineers was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labor. In accordance with the Resolution of the Council of Ministers of the RSFSR of January 18, 1991, No. 30 [...] "On the Republican Program for Land Reform in the Territory of the RSFSR" [...] and Order No. 193 of 24 March 1992 on the Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation, University for Land Management with the training of specialists in land law, land management, soil science, <b>geobotany,</b> geodesy, architecture and planning of villages.|$|E
40|$|<b>Geobotany</b> {{describes}} {{the relationships of}} soil, bedrock, and groundwater to plant species occurrence. For exploration geologists, <b>geobotany</b> can be a useful tool to map substrata rich in economically desirable elements and minerals. <b>Geobotany</b> {{can also be a}} valuable resource in delineating and predicting habitat for species whose populations are in jeopardy. Graham 2 ̆ 7 s columbine (Aquilegia grahamii) is endemic to an oil-bearing shale member of the Green River Formation within Uintah County, Utah. Increasing threats of oil development within the Formation and its present listing of critically imperiled make conservation efforts necessary to increase the range of this species. I will map additional suitable habitat for Graham 2 ̆ 7 s columbine along outcrops of oil-bearing shale of the Formation in Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming. I expect to find habitat outside Uintah County that would be sufficient for the expansion of Graham 2 ̆ 7 s columbine, which would aid in future management of this species...|$|E

40|$|<b>Geobotany</b> {{studies the}} {{relation}} between the physical environment and the physiognomic, morphological, taxonomic, phenological and physiological expressions of the vegetation. Traditionally utilized in exploration geology, in which the intense geological variability extends up to the soil, <b>geobotany</b> can be applied to geologically-common terrains. The Jureia-Itatins Ecological Station, located in southeastern Brazils Iguape municipality, contains several phytophysiognomies associated with the Atlantic Forest biome, including the Restinga Forest. This forest, of significant biodiversity, grows on sediments deposited during sea-level variations in the Quaternary. The joint analysis of sediment granulometry, soil fertility, water table depth, leaf area, number of trees per plot, floristic similarity and species density allowed to separate homologous areas, here called geobotanical units. Remote sensing has been successfully applied to <b>geobotany</b> and, in this study, we analyzed the relationship between the canopies spectral response from the studied mosaic of forests and the aforementioned set of field parameters i. e., the relationship between the canopies and the geobotanical units. Bands of the reflected spectrum of ASTER Images, processed accordingly to the systemic method, revealed the correlation between the canopy spectral behaviour and the set of field parameters. There are three important advances: (i) an indication that the set of parameters of the physical environment and the forestry characteristics may define the local environment, (ii) the set of parameters is manifested in the canopy and (iii) multispectral optical images with medium spectral and spatial resolution could partially identify this canopy variability and its relation to the physical environment.
