40|$|In {{this paper}} a novel all-optical switch using twodimensional {{nonlinear}} photonic crystal including some twin defects is investigated. For {{illustration of the}} capability and simulation of behavior of the proposed structure, Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) algorithm is used. Our simulations show that inserting a twin defects has serious effect on switching and hard limiting behavior. Also, the switching threshold value and slope of transfer function are changed strongly with position of defects and number of defect layers respectively. It is shown that the number, position and distance between defects have critical effect on switching and limiting characteristics. Also, the proposed structure {{can be used as}} optical hard limiter that is used in <b>digital</b> <b>optical</b> integrated <b>circuits.</b> Key word...|$|R

In this paper, we present recent advances in all-optical processing circuits and examine the potential of their integration into a system environment. On this concept, we demonstrate serial all-optical Boolean AND/XOR logic at 20 Gb/s and a novel all-optical packet clock recovery circuit, with low capturing time, suitable for burst-mode traffic. The circuits use the semiconductor-based ultrafast nonlinear interferometer (UNI) as the nonlinear switching element. We also present the integration of these circuits in a more complex unit that performs header and payload separation from short synchronous data packets at 10 Gb/s. Finally, we discuss a method to realize a novel packet scheduling switch architecture, which guarantees lossless communication for specific traffic burstiness constraints, using these logic units...|$|R

40|$|Integrating <b>optical</b> <b>circuit</b> {{switches}} in data-centers is an on-going research challenge. In recent years, state-of-the-art solutions introduce hybrid packet/circuit architectures {{for different}} <b>optical</b> <b>circuit</b> switch technologies, control techniques, and traffic rerouting methods. These solutions {{are based on}} separated packet and circuit planes which {{do not have the}} ability to utilize an <b>optical</b> <b>circuit</b> with flows that do not arrive from or delivered to switches directly connected to the circuit's end-points. Moreover, current SDN-based elephant flow rerouting methods require a forwarding rule for each flow, which raise scalability issues. In this paper, we present C-Share [...] a practical, scalable SDN-based circuit sharing solution for data center networks. C-Share inherently enable elephant flows to share <b>optical</b> <b>circuits</b> by exploiting a flat upper tier network topology. C-Share is based on a scalable and decoupled SDN-based elephant flow rerouting method comprised of elephant flow detection, tagging and identification, which is utilized by using a prevalent network sampling method (e. g., sFlow). C-Share requires only a single OpenFlow rule for each <b>optical</b> <b>circuit,</b> and therefore significantly reduces the required OpenFlow rule entry footprint and setup rule rate. It also mitigates the OpenFlow outbound latency for subsequent elephant flows. We implement a proof-of-concept system for C-Share based on Mininet, and test the scalability of C-Share by using an event driven simulation. Our results show a consistent increase in the mice/elephant flow separation in the network which, in turn, improves both network throughput and flow completion time...|$|R
40|$|Today, {{the demand}} for {{high-speed}} data communication and mobile communication has exploded. Thus, {{there is a growing}} need for optical communication systems that convert large volumes of data to optical signals and that accommodate and transmit the signals across long distances. <b>Digital</b> <b>optical</b> communication with these characteristics consists of a master unit (MU) and a slave unit (SU). However, the <b>digital</b> <b>optical</b> units that are currently commercialized or being developed transmit data without compression. Thus, <b>digital</b> <b>optical</b> communication using these units is restricted by the quantity of optical frames when adding diversity or operating with various combinations of CDMA, WCDMA, WiBro, GSM, LTE, and other mobile communication technologies. This paper suggests the application of a data compression algorithm to a digital signal processor (DSP) chip as a field programmable gate array (FPGA) and a complex programmable logic device (CPLD) of a <b>digital</b> <b>optical</b> unit to add separate optical waves or to transmit complex data without specific changes in design of the optical frame...|$|R

40|$|The {{advantage}} of designing high speed hybrid {{wavelength division multiplexing}} (WDM) optical networks - in which a tributary signal may be switched over a sequence of (multi-hop) <b>optical</b> <b>circuits</b> - is manifold.

In addition, although limited, the transparency of the <b>optical</b> <b>circuits</b> enables multi-rate nodes to coexist in the same hybrid network architecture. The paper proposes an approach to designing cost-effective hybrid optical networks with arbitrary topology and multi-rate nodes, and demonstrates numerically the advantages of such a solution in the presence of both impairment-free and polarization mode dispersion (PMD) impaired fibers...|$|R
