40|$|The {{effects of}} 2 bromo α ergocryptine methanesulphonate on the {{response}} of the pituitary gland of the male rat to <b>diethylstilboestrol</b> <b>dipropionate</b> were studied by radioimmunoassay of prolactin and growth hormone and measurements of DNA synthesis. Given before diethylstilboestrol, 2 bromo α ergocryptine prevented the oestrogen induced rise in serum prolactin and partly inhibited pituitary DNA synthesis. Given on days 4 - 6 of a 6 day period after a single dose of diethylstilboestrol, 2 bromo α ergocryptine rapidly increased pituitary prolactin concentration, diminished serum prolactin, reduced pituitary DNA synthesis and did not affect the growth hormone response to oestrogen...|$|E
40|$|The {{induction}} of aneuploidy in cultured mammalian cells {{has been}} studied using two chemical agents, <b>diethylstilboestrol</b> <b>dipropionate</b> and Colcemid, which act on the mitotic spin-dle, in order to investigate different methods of scoring and statistical analysis. Two cell lines, one human and the other Chinese hamster, were each exposed to one test agent, and metaphase preparations scored (a) counting all the chromo-somes and (b) counting only the chromosomes of a selected group within the karyotype, to assess {{which would be the}} more rapid means of scoring metaphases for aneuploidy. Both the numbers of aneuploid cells and, where appropriate, the total numbers of chromosomes lost and gained were analys-ed using regression analysis, G-statistics and x 2 or Fisher's exact test. The results indicate that counting selective chromo-somes may in certain circumstances be advantageous, but will result in many more metaphases being required to be scored. Regression analysis to demonstrate dose response is suitable for the analysis of strong positives, but it is suggested that with weak inducers of aneuploidy, the additional tests cited above, using either the number of aneuploid cells or the ac-tual number of chromosomes lost and gained are more sen-sitive measures of the effects...|$|E
