In the case <b>of</b> F(R) <b>gravity,</b> we investigate the gravitational shock wave solutions corresponding to various cosmologically viable gravities, and as we demonstrate the solutions are rescaled versions <b>of</b> the Einstein-Hilbert <b>gravity</b> solution. Interestingly enough, other higher order gravities result to the general relativistic solution, except for some specific <b>gravities</b> <b>of</b> the form F(R_μνR^μν) and F(R,R_μνR^μν), which we study in detail. In addition, when realistic Gauss-Bonnet <b>gravities</b> <b>of</b> the form R+F(G) are considered, the gravitational shock wave solutions are identical to the general relativistic solution. Finally, the singularity structure of the gravitational shock waves solutions is studied, and it is shown that the effect <b>of</b> higher order <b>gravities</b> makes the singularities milder {{in comparison to the}} general relativistic solutions, and in some particular cases the singularities seem to be absent.

5|$|Because their {{elliptical}} orbits frequently {{take them}} {{close to the}} giant planets, comets are subject to further gravitational perturbations. Short-period comets have a tendency for their aphelia to coincide with a giant planet's semi-major axis, with the JFCs being the largest group. It is clear that comets {{coming in from the}} Oort cloud often have their orbits strongly influenced by the <b>gravity</b> <b>of</b> giant planets {{as a result of a}} close encounter. Jupiter is the source of the greatest perturbations, being more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. These perturbations can deflect long-period comets into shorter orbital periods.|$|E
5|$|Comets can loosely {{be divided}} into two categories: short-period and long-period—the latter being thought to {{originate}} in the Oort cloud. The two major categories of short-period comets are Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) and Halley-type comets. Halley-type comets, which are named after their prototype, Halley's Comet, are thought to have originated in the Oort cloud but to have been drawn into the inner Solar System by the <b>gravity</b> <b>of</b> the giant planets, whereas the JFCs are thought to have originated in the scattered disc. The centaurs are thought to be a dynamically intermediate stage between the scattered disc and the Jupiter family.|$|E

30|$|The {{standard}} short-term allowable {{lateral resistance}} {{according to the}} current Japanese design standard for timber structures [9] of nailed plywood–timber joints with Todomatsu timber and Karamatsu plywood is 66  % of 667  N, which is two-thirds of the control static maximum load. In this design standard, the allowable lateral resistance is conservatively given for the lower limit specific <b>gravities</b> <b>of</b> the materials. Because the specific <b>gravities</b> <b>of</b> the materials {{used in this study}} were higher than the lower limit values, the short-term allowable lateral resistance was adjusted to the actual specific gravities. The resultant short-term allowable resistance was 494  N, 74  % of 667  N [9]. As a result, one-third, two-thirds and three-thirds of the control maximum load corresponded to 0.68, 1.36 and 2.03 times the short-term allowable lateral resistance adjusted to the actual specific <b>gravities</b> <b>of</b> the materials. In this study, the rounded average maximum load was adopted as the control value with no conservative estimation. This was due to the consideration that an underestimation of the input forces would result in an overestimation of the dynamic resistance.|$|R
