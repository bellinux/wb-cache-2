Assuming {{the role of the}} boy, the player flies through a dream world and manipulates clouds to solve puzzles. The game was intended to spark emotions in the player that the video game industry usually ignored.|$|E

The FBI locate Dees' home, but his electronic surveillance had alerted him long before, and he has escaped before they even arrive. However, as Black sits in his car, he receives a call from Dees, who has booby-trapped the car. The FBI are able to monitor this call with Dees' equipment. Dees tells Black that they will both soon be famous, letting Black know that he has a remote detonator for the car's explosives. Before he can use it, he is killed by a police marksman.|$|E
5|$|Anthony first appears when he poses as {{a member}} of the Walford council to help Eddie eject a {{squatter}} from a premises that they want to move their antiques business into. He then decides to remain in Walford and helps his father set up the business. Anthony buys some candlesticks from Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), though she does not know their true value, but when Cora finds out their true value, she accuses Anthony of scamming her. Eddie sells the candlesticks for £8000, and when Tyler decides to take part in an unlicensed boxing match, Michael convinces Anthony that Tyler will win and that it would be a good idea to place a bet on him, knowing that Anthony suffers with a gambling addiction. Anthony steals £8000 from Eddie's safe, but bets on Tyler's opponent Artie Stiller (Maurice Lee), which leaves Michael unimpressed, as he has researched Artie and found out he is tough. During the fight, however, Tyler narrowly wins so Anthony has to confess to Eddie that he has lost the money. Shortly after he does, Tyler collapses and has a seizure, so is rushed to hospital. Eddie is sickened by Anthony's actions and tells him he wishes he was dying <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>bed,</b> rather than Tyler. Distraught, Anthony storms out and attends a party run by Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton), culminating in him kissing her. Afterwards, Anthony returns to the hospital to learn that Tyler has been taken for a life-saving operation and is furious that Eddie was not around. Eddie then admits that his children would be better off without him. Tyler survives and recovers, but the brothers are told by Eddie that Michael set up an unfair fight to punish the family, leading Tyler and Anthony to reject Michael. Eddie then leaves Walford, leaving Tyler and Anthony the antiques business.|$|E

Of 143627 patients identified 40 % (57678) died <b>in</b> <b>an</b> acute <b>hospital,</b> 29 % (41957) died at home and 17 % (24108) died <b>in</b> <b>a</b> hospice. Individual factors associated with death <b>in</b> <b>an</b> acute <b>hospital</b> <b>bed</b> compared to home were male sex, increasing age, poor performance status, social deprivation and diagnosis via an emergency route. There was marked variation between cancer Networks in place of death. The proportion of patients dying <b>in</b> <b>an</b> acute <b>hospital</b> ranged from 28 % to 48 %, with variation most notable in provision of hospice care (9 % versus 33 %). Cause of death in the majority was lung cancer (86 %), with other malignancies, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) comprising 9 % collectively. A substantial proportion of patients with lung cancer die in acute <b>hospital</b> <b>beds</b> and this is more likely with increasing age, male sex, social deprivation and in those with poor performance status. There is marked variation between Networks, suggesting a need to improve end-of-life planning in those at greatest risk, and to review the allocation of resources to provide more hospice beds, enhanced community support and ensure equal access...|$|R

Her boyfriend gets mad and then throws a vase at the wall while Spears goes into the bathroom, hurling something at the mirror. She begins to fill the bathtub and remove her clothes. After this, the video includes intercut scenes of a close-up of Spears singing in a white shirt {{in front of a}} bright white light. As she lies in the bathtub, a red string, a custom associated with Kabbalah is seen in her wrist. She touches her head and looks at her hand, realizing she is bleeding from the wound. According to Jennifer Vineyard of MTV, the blood in her hand is stigmata. She loses consciousness in the bathtub and drowns. Shortly after, her boyfriend finds her and tries to resuscitate her. Meanwhile, it is revealed that in the close-up scenes Spears is actually inside a hospital hallway. The video continues with scenes of her being carried into an ambulance and surrounded by photographers, as well as scenes of her being resuscitated by doctors <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>bed.</b> The ghost of Spears in a white shirt, watches herself in the bed and walks into the next room, where a baby girl is born.

Mariella Barreto, {{an agent of the}} Peruvian Army Intelligence Service, is also sometimes credited with leaking this map to a Peruvian magazine. An investigation of the site indicated on the map by the public prosecutor revealed four clandestine graves. Forensic tests conducted on the remains, and on another set of bones found at another site, revealed that they belonged to Muñoz Sánchez and the students Luis Enrique Ortiz Perea, Armando Amaro Condor, and Juan Gabriel Mariños Figueroa, and {{that at least some of}} them had been tortured prior to receiving an execution-style coup-de-grâce to the base of the neck. Barreto was murdered some years later: her decapitated and dismembered corpse, showing signs of ante-mortem torture, was found in March 1997.

500|$|... 12 Monkeys is {{inspired}} by the French short film La Jetée (1962); as in La Jetée, characters are haunted by the image of their own death. Like La Jetée, 12 Monkeys contains references to Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958). Toward {{the end of the}} film, Cole and Railly hide in a theater showing a 24-hour Hitchcock marathon and watch a scene from Vertigo. Railly then transforms herself with a blonde wig, as Judy (Kim Novak) transformed herself into blonde Madeleine in Vertigo; Cole sees her emerge within a red light, as Scottie (James Stewart) saw Judy emerge within a green light. Brief notes of Bernard Herrmann's film score can also be heard. Railly also wears the same coat Novak wore {{in the first part of}} Vertigo. The scene at Muir Woods National Monument, where Judy (as Madeleine) looks at the growth rings of a felled redwood and traces back events in her past life, resonates with larger themes in 12 Monkeys. Cole and Railly later have a similar conversation while the same music from Vertigo is repeated. The Muir Woods scene in Vertigo is also re-enacted in La Jetée. In a previous scene in the film, Cole wakes up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hospital</b> <b>bed</b> with scientists of the future talking to him in chorus.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{primary purpose}} of this study is to {{identify}} the readmission possibilities following a swing bed program <b>in</b> <b>an</b> acute critical <b>hospital.</b> The length of stay <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>hospital</b> swing <b>bed</b> or skilled care status program has less readmission rates. SUBJECTS: 426 patients were admitted into the Eaton Rapids Medical Center from January through December of 2015. Patients that are admitted into the swing bed program range from 7 years old to 101 years old, but majority of the patients are 40 years old. The patients ranged from acute critical care to waiting for redirection into long term care. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Through electronic medical records on admission, length of stay, readmission, age, race, types of insurance used. The method that I used was the multiple regression correlation coefficient to determine the purpose. ANALYSES: The severity of the diagnosis for the admission of the patient depended on whether the patient was admitted into the swing bed program verses inpatient recovery. If the patient were readmitted they automatically were in the swing bed program. The patients that were admitted directly into the skilled nursing critical care based on diagnosis had lower readmission rate. The length of stay results in less readmission rates as well as healthier return to daily living activities. CONCLUSION: While conceptualizing this project, I had the inclination that the availability of a swing bed program would influence patients to choose the swing bed program and leave the hospital healthier and able to return to their daily living...|$|R
