5|$|The initial {{plan was}} to arm every fifth T-26 with the 37mm <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right turret, but the final {{proportion}} was somewhat higher. About 450 twin-turreted T-26 mod. 1931 tanks mounting the 37mm <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right turret were produced in 1931–1933 (including only 20–30 tanks with the B-3 gun).

5|$|T-26 model 1931 with gun plus {{machine gun}} armament: twin-turreted version with a 37mm <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right turret (some modern sources mention this tank as T-26 model 1932). There were two models of 37mm {{guns in the}} USSR {{suitable}} for mounting in light tanks at that time—the Hotchkiss gun (or its Soviet improved variant PS-1), and the more powerful PS-2 gun developed by P. Syachentov. The latter was superior, but only experimental models existed. Therefore, the first 10 pre-production T-26s, which had a design identical to the Vickers 6-Ton, were equipped with a Hotchkiss <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right turret to increase firepower compared to the machine gun armed Vickers tank. The experimental PS-2 gun was mounted on only three T-26 tanks, the right turrets of which were replaced with small gun turrets from the T-35-1 (prototype of the T-35 heavy tank).|$|E

5|$|A <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Czech Republic is {{available}} to anybody subject to acquiring a shall issue firearms license first. Gun licenses may be obtained in a way very similar to a driving license – by passing a gun proficiency exam, medical examination and having a clean criminal record. Unlike in most other European countries, the Czech gun legislation also permits a citizen to carry a concealed weapon for self-defense – 240,000 out of some 300,000 legal gun owners have concealed carry permit. The vast majority of Czech gun owners possess their firearms for protection, with hunting and sport shooting being less common.|$|E

5|$|Abramski v. United States, , was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court found that making {{arrangements}} for a straw purchase of a gun is in violation of the Gun Control Act of 1968, and is different from re-selling or gifting a previously purchased <b>gun.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Abramski case, a former police officer from Virginia took advantage of a local discount to buy a gun for his uncle and later transferred it to Pennsylvania—the uncle's residence—using the appropriate federal procedure. During the purchase, Abramski falsely declared that he is purchasing the gun for himself.|$|E
5|$|Another project {{combining}} the T-34 tank chassis with the D-15 gun was also considered. Designated SU-D15, the medium assault gun {{was intended as}} a replacement for the SU-122. Although the project received a lot of support from the authorities it never entered production, both because of its shortcomings (the heavy gun put too much strain on the suspension and ammunition stowage was too limited) and because it was made redundant by the ISU-152. However lessons learned mounting a powerful <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> T-34 allowed for rapid development of the SU-100 tank destroyer.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, {{the only}} Soviet factory {{suitable}} for T-26 production was the Bolshevik Factory in Leningrad, which had had experience manufacturing the MS-1 (T-18) light tanks since 1927. It was also {{planned to use}} the Stalingrad Tractor Factory, which was under construction at that time. But {{the production of the}} T-26 proved to be much more complicated than the semi-handicraft assembly of the MS-1, so the planned production of 500 T-26s in 1931 proved to be impossible. The Bolshevik Factory needed to convert all tank drawings from imperial units into metric, in order to develop a production technology, special tools, and equipment. The first 10 T-26s were assembled in July 1931 – they were identical to British Vickers 6-Ton tanks except for their armament. Soviet tanks were armed with the 37mm Hotchkiss (PS-1) <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right turret and the 7.62mm DT tank machine <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> left turret. These T-26s from the development batch were of low quality and made from mild steel, but it was an important test of the new tank production technology.|$|E

5|$|T-26 model 1933: single turret version {{armed with}} 45mm 20K tank gun and DT tank machine gun. This version {{had a new}} {{cylindrical}} turret with a large rear niche. Some tanks were equipped with a 71-TK-1 radio station with a hand-rail antenna around the turret (so-called radio tanks). They were upgraded in 1935 with a welded hull and turret, and again in 1936 with a rear DT tank machine <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> turret. In 1937, some tanks were equipped with an anti-aircraft machine gun and a searchlight. The model 1933 was the most numerous variant.|$|E
5|$|The most {{noticeable}} {{feature of the}} fort is the circular keep. This was modeled on the reduit de surete of the Lunette d'Arçon, and it also bears similarities to the tour-reduits built in Malta in the early 18th century (the only surviving example is Vendôme Tower). It had two rows of musketry loopholes, and its roof contained a parapet with four embrasures. The latter was replaced with a sloping parapet to mount a single <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1860s. The keep also contains the main gate, above which is a commemorative plaque.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1937, {{there was}} an effort to equip many tanks with a second machine <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rear of the turret and an {{anti-aircraft}} machine gun on top of it, as well as the addition of two searchlights above the gun for night gunnery, a new VKU-3 command system, and a TPU-3 intercom. Some tanks had a vertically stabilised TOP-1 gun telescopic sight. Ammunition stowage for the main gun was improved from 122 rounds to 147. In 1938, the cylindrical turret was replaced with a conical turret, with the same 45mm model 1934 gun. Some T-26s mod. 1938/1939, equipped with radio set, had a PTK commander's panoramic sight.|$|E
5|$|Digging for Fire {{was based}} on a real {{incident}} in which Jake Johnson and his wife dug up a bone and a <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garden of a house they had rented. Over a couple of weeks, he and a group of his friends dug up various objects before deciding to bury them again. Johnson described the experience to Joe Swanberg about three years later and they decided to make a film about it. They wrote a two-and-a-half–page outline that summarized the plot but included no dialogue or detailed character descriptions. Swanberg wanted the actors to improvise the details of each scene and allowed them to make choices about their characters: for instance, Orlando Bloom decided that his character would ride a motorcycle, Chris Messina suggested that his character go swimming naked, and Brie Larson persuaded Johnson and Swanberg that her character would not be sexually attracted to Tim.|$|E
5|$|In November 1942, Koppelman {{was drafted}} into the United States Army and in 1943 he married painter Dorothy Myers.

He manned an anti-aircraft machine <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> D-Day landing on Omaha Beach, and later, as staff sergeant, was awarded a Bronze Star. Before the invasion, {{he had been able to}} study at the Art College of Western England in Bristol, and later at the École des Beaux-Arts in Reims. While on leave, he visited Picasso's studio in Paris, and it was Picasso and Louis Aragon who told Koppelman that the war in Europe was over. Letters describing his wartime experience are in the Chaim and Dorothy Koppelman papers at the Smithsonian Archives of American Art.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the Taleba Bay {{force on}} Stuart {{transferred}} to Tieryo, a ship's launch and a ship's whaleboat, and was ashore by 03:30 on 23 October. They captured a Japanese machine gun position at about 06:00. Two platoons went south {{where they were}} engaged by Japanese forces. The Japanese were driven beyond Niubulu Creek, but a heavy Japanese counterattack from the north at 09:00 inflicted casualties on the Australians and forced them {{to withdraw from the}} area. Gategood broke radio silence and attempted to contact Arnold on the 108 set, but was unable to reach him. After this, they came under heavy mortar and machine gun fire, which inflicted heavy casualties. Having lost six men killed and ten wounded, with three more posted as missing, the Australians were forced to fall back under pressure from the pursuing Japanese. Lieutenant Clifford Hoskings would later receive the Military Cross for silencing a Japanese machine <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ensuing fighting. Faced with being overrun, Gategood withdrew his force even further, at first back to Taleba Bay, and then to Mud Bay aboard Stuart, arriving on 24 October.|$|E
5|$|Olds often {{lamented the}} lack of an {{internal}} <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> F-4C he flew during his tour in Vietnam, but would not allow his fighters to be equipped with the gun pods then available. While he knew that he would be capable of effectively using them, he was also aware that none of his pilots were trained in the use of a gun or dogfighting. He also reasoned that the drag of the pod would both degrade the performance characteristics of the F-4 while not gaining it any advantage against the more maneuverable MiG-17s and MiG-21s, result in unnecessary losses strafing worthless targets, and reduce the number of bombs carried by the Phantoms, the delivery of which was the 8th's primary mission.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland. MacLachlan's {{squadron}} {{moved to}} France on 2 September, and Britain and her allies declared war the following day. 88 Squadron formed {{part of the}} RAF Advanced Air Striking Force (AASF) commanded by Air Vice-Marshal Patrick Playfair. On 12 September 1939 88 Squadron was based southeast of Rheims. At this time the Luftwaffe was heavily engaged in Poland {{and only a few}} small-scale skirmishes were fought with a thin German fighter screen left to guard western Germany against a French attack. On 20 September elements of the squadron were intercepted by Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters from Jagdgeschwader 26 (Fighter Wing 26) over the border. Four Fairey Battle aircraft were shot down. On 30 September 150 Squadron lost five Battles on unescorted missions into German airspace. It quickly became clear to the crews that the Battle was too slow and too poorly armed to defend itself and operations were shut down. The squadron took measures to increase its defensive power by adding a third machine <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> back of the cockpit for the observer to use.|$|E
