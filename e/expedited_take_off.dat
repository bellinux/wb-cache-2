30|$|This {{paper is}} {{focussed}} to address first two questions partly by considering airport model, aircrafts, controllers and other necessary sub-systems which {{are required to}} complete the formal model. There are two main sub-systems, i.e., ground and local controllers at an airport for air traffic management which are very less focussed by the scientific community. Functionality of ground controller is to share information with other sub-systems, for example, to define priorities among various operators and to provide an active decision support functions for route predictions. Local controllers are deployed for executing processes of aircrafts waiting at the airport surface for runway, taking off, landing or flying over the airport. Aircrafts are allowed to push back whenever are ready and the runway capacity is constrained. The aircrafts can <b>take</b> <b>off</b> only {{one at a time}} from a single runway while many aircrafts are waiting in the queue. For this purpose safe and efficient computer models are required to be developed to improve pushback and taxiing algorithms to <b>expedite</b> the <b>take</b> <b>off</b> procedure.|$|R

50|$|Aircraft {{can have}} {{different}} ways to <b>take</b> <b>off</b> and land. Conventional airplanes accelerate along the ground until sufficient lift is generated for takeoff, and reverse the process to land. Some airplanes can <b>take</b> <b>off</b> at low speed, this being a short takeoff. Some aircraft such as helicopters and Harrier Jump Jets can <b>take</b> <b>off</b> and land vertically. Rockets also usually <b>take</b> <b>off</b> vertically, but some designs can land horizontally.|$|R

50|$|The first {{privately owned}} airport in Samarinda, Borneo, was located at Mahakam.

50|$|Vertical takeoff {{refers to}} {{aircraft}} or rockets that <b>take</b> <b>off</b> in a vertical trajectory. Vertical takeoff {{eliminates the need}} for airfields. Most vertical <b>take</b> <b>off</b> aircraft are also able to land horizontally, but there were certain rocket-powered aircraft of the Luftwaffe that only <b>took</b> <b>off</b> vertically, landing in other ways. The Bachem Ba 349 Natter landed under a parachute after having <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> vertically. Other late Third Reich projects, such as the Heinkel P.1077 Julia or the Focke-Wulf Volksjäger 2 climbed to their ceiling at a nearly vertical angle and landed later on a skid.|$|R
