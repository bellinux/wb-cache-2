50|$|The jack is steered by a 'tiller' like lever {{that also}} {{acts as the}} pump handle for raising the jack. A small handle on the tiller {{releases}} the hydraulic fluid, causing the forks to lower. The front wheels inside {{the end of the}} forks are mounted on levers attached to linkages that go to levers attached to the <b>jack</b> <b>cylinder.</b> As the hydraulic jack at the 'tiller' end is raised, the links force the wheels down, raising the forks vertically above the front wheels, raising the load upward until it clears the floor. The pallet is only lifted enough to clear the floor for subsequent travel. Oftentimes, pallet jacks are used to move and organize pallets inside a trailer, especially when there is no forklift truck access or availability.|$|E

5|$|The new 3-litre engines under {{development}} by competing team Ferrari had 12 <b>cylinders.</b> <b>Jack</b> Brabham, owner and lead driver of BRO, {{took a different}} approach to the problem of obtaining a suitable engine. He persuaded Australian company Repco to develop a new 3-litre eight-cylinder engine for him, largely based on available components; the engine would produce less power than Ferrari's, but would be lighter, easier to fix and more fuel efficient.|$|R
40|$|Naturally, {{there are}} complex {{interactions}} among {{internal combustion engine}} parameters such as in-cylinder pressure, emissions, speed, and load. These basic relationships are studied in a naturally aspirated, spark-ignited, two-stroke, large-bore natural gas engine. The typical application for such an engine is operating heavy machinery such as large compressors and oil field pump <b>jacks.</b> <b>Cylinder</b> pressure averaged over 300 cycles is captured for eight speeds from 350 to 525 RPM and six loads of 50 % to 100 % of maximum torque at each respective speed. Non-sequential individual cycle pressure curves are captured to depict cyclic variation at each operating point. Emissions are measured for each operating point. Equivalence ratio, delivery ratio, and trapping efficiencies are also calculated. The behavior of these parameters are then quantified and described {{in the context of}} cyclic variation. It is shown that low load cyclic variation is extreme, having coefficient of variance (COV) of indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) values over 40 %. Low load cycles are shown to frequently misfire or experience partial burn. Cyclic variation is shown to decrease with increasing load and decreasing speed. Air flow rate is shown to increase with engine speed. It is also shown that the overall system equivalence ratio is highest at high loads and low speeds, and the values are between 0. 55 and 0. 90. Brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) is suspected to decrease with increasing load, likely due to improved scavenging at high load. Delivery ratio is shown to be, on average, slightly greater than 1. 0 at most operating conditions. Fuel trapping efficiency has a complex trend with increasing speed. Air trapping efficiencies disagree with those calculated for fuel, and are likely incorrect due to the lean-burning nature of the engine. Scavenging efficiency results are not credible. Emissions of CO 2, NO, and THC are shown (and emissions of CH 4 are suspected) to have an inverse correlation with cyclic variation; emissions of O 2 are shown (and emissions of CO are suspected) to have direct correlation with cyclic variation...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} the {{investigation}} is the hydraulic cylinders of self-propelled jib cranes on a special truck-type chassis and automobile cranes with telescopic booms. The purpose is the synthesis of the hydraulic power cylinders of building cranes by formalization of variable parameters meeting the required reliability level at a lower mass {{on the basis of}} a universal design method. A mathemamical hydraulic cylinder model establishing the interrelation between the vector of the stress-strain state in the hydraulic cylinder sections and loading conditions reflecting the degree of the interaction of the components between each other, the hydraulic cylinder on the whole and the metal structure and supporting devices has been developed; the mechanisms forming loads on the bracing <b>jack</b> hydraulic <b>cylinders</b> in the crane index contour and the telescoping hydraulic cylinders have been determined with the deformability of the components of the metal structures and supporting devices considered. Methods for analysing and evaluating the stuctural parameters, including the weight and reliability ones, providing their optimum combination have been worked outAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} detect {{incipient}} failures {{due to a}} progressive wear of a primary flight command electro hydraulic actuator (EHA), prognostics could employ several approaches; {{the choice of the}} best ones is driven by the efficacy shown in failure detection, since not all the algorithms might be useful for the proposed purpose. In other words, some of them could be suitable only for certain applications while they could not give useful results for others. Developing a fault detection algorithm able to identify the precursors of the above mentioned EHA failure and its degradation pattern is thus beneficial for anticipating the incoming failure and alerting the maintenance crew so as to properly schedule the servomechanism replacement. The research presented in the paper was focused to develop a new prognostic procedure centered on the characterization of the state of health of a common electro-hydraulic actuator for primary command usage. It is based on an innovative model based fault detection and identification method (FDI) that makes use of deterministic and heuristic solvers in order to converge to the actual state of wear of the tested actuator. In particular, the proposed model takes in account three different types of progressive failures: the clogging of the first stage of the flapper-nozzle valve, the rising of friction between spool and sleeve and finally the rising of friction between <b>jack</b> and <b>cylinder.</b> To assess the robustness of the proposed technique, an appropriate simulation test environment was developed. The results showed an adequate robustness and confidence was gained in the ability to early identify an eventual EHA malfunctioning with low risk of false alarms or missed failure...|$|R
30|$|Under {{the ground}} pressure, the top coal is {{fractured}} and caved. The size of coal is different {{depending on the}} coal hardness. During the process of top coal discharge, the increase in large coals causes a balanced arch above the support discharge window and blocks the coal flow. In this case, {{the base of the}} balanced arch should be fractured using the coal discharge device. In addition, the large coal blocks should be crushed to enable the continuity of coal discharge. Therefore, a high efficient and high recovery coal discharge device was developed with a strong disturbance capacity. Two <b>jacks</b> with a <b>cylinder</b> diameter of ϕ 180  mm were installed on the tail beam for operation. The force of a single jack was 1000 kN (P =  39  MPa) and 2000 kN with both. In order to increase the disturbance to top coals, the upswing of the tail beam can reach 19.5 ° to crush top coals, and the down swing can reach 41 ° to loosen coal flow. During the process of top coal discharge, the tail beam was swung continuously to disturb the awaited top coals and to achieve a high efficient and high recovery coal discharge.|$|R
