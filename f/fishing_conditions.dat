Westslope cutthroat trout, bull trout, kokanee salmon (the landlocked Pacific salmon), rainbow trout and white sturgeon are among the many species found in the river. [...] Kokanee and rainbows are commonly found in Lake Koocanusa. Kootenai Falls, which drops some [...] within a run {{of a few hundred}} meters, forms a natural boundary between fishes of the upper and lower river, but Libby Dam, several kilometres upstream, is an even more formidable barrier. Fish in the Kootenay have traditionally been abundant but the construction of the dam may have led to declines in the population of sturgeon, among other fishes, because of changes in water flow. The best season for fishing is from June to November. One may fish from banks, sandbars and islands, or from boats. Because of the size and strength of the river, fishing from drift boats is easier than from the shore.

500|$|Another {{anti-hunting}} demonstration {{becomes the}} film's focus, {{this time on}} the Isle of Wight. Nudity and intercourse are practiced freely amongst the demonstrators, and this is contrasted with ancient hunter-gathering groups, who had strict rules concerning nudity. The narrator argues that once hunting had left this group of people, so did their rules toward nudity. Also highlighted is the contradiction that though this people are against hunting, thousands of farm-raised animals had to die to support them. The focus changes to Humboldt penguins, which cannot hunt because of polluted waters, and thus seem detached and without focus. This effect is compared to modern day Eskimos, who no longer hunt since the discovery of oil in their homeland and have fallen into depression and melancholy. To reverse the process, several groups of men go out and revive their hunting ways. Reflected in this is a montage of gun ownership, which the film relates to feelings of masculinity, followed by shots of illegal elephant poaching from Africa. To offset the dwindling number of game due to poaching, warriors from the Lobi tribe celebrate the [...] "Ceremony of Life", in which they masturbate with ceremonial rods and pour the product into the river, hoping the animals will drink the semen and multiply.

CART identified 3 groups of years where the fish populations generally showed poor, average and good condition and within which condition differed between age classes but not according to sex.

40|$|Abstract This study {{identifies}} environmental predic-tors of {{the condition}} of two introduced tilapia species (Oreochromis leucostictus and Tilapia zillii) that {{are known to have}} divergent trophic niches (planktivore and herbivore, respectively) in 17 crater lakes in western Uganda. We asked whether <b>fish</b> <b>condition</b> differs among lakes characterized by differences in fishing pressure and catchment deforestation; and we related relative condition factor to gradients of environmental variation across lakes. Lakes charac-terized by severe catchment deforestation tended to be lakes with high fishing pressure, so it was difficult to explore independent and interactive effects. However, mean relative condition factor was higher in populations with high fishing pressure compared to populations with low fishing pressure for both O. leucostictus and T. zillii. The condition of O. leucostictus populations was higher in lakes with severely deforested catch-ments; but mean relative condition factor of T. zillii did not differ between deforestation categories. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to describe the major environmental gradients of variation among the lakes; and PCA factor scores were regressed against relative <b>fish</b> <b>condition.</b> The association between <b>fish</b> <b>condition</b> and environmental gradients was stronger for O. leucostictus than for T. zillii. For O. leucostictus, <b>fish</b> <b>condition</b> was related to PC 1 (43 % of the variance) and factors that loaded most heavily included Chl-a, water transparency, lake area and depth, suggesting higher condition in lakes characterized by higher primary productivity and smaller size. For T. zillii, PC 3 (11 %) was the only axis related to fish condition; and factors that loaded most heavily included lake area (positive), and conductivity and total nitrogen (nega-tive). Some of the larger lakes are characterized by higher availability of macrophytes that may positively affect the food base for T. zillii...|$|R

Determining the relative importance of different nurseries in maintaining the parental population, however, can be difficult. In the western Gulf of Alaska, the Kodiak Island vicinity may be particularly well suited as a pollock nursery because of a prey-rich nearshore environment. Our objectives were 1) to examine age- 0 pollock body condition, growth, and diet for evidence of a nearshore-shelf effect, and 2) to determine if variation in the potential prey field of zooplankton was associated with this effect. This was a pilot study that occurred in three bays and over the adjacent shelf off east Kodiak Island during 5 − 18 September 1993. Sampling occurred only during night at locations where echo sign indicated the presence of age- 0 pollock. Echo sign was targeted to increase the chance of collecting fish given the limited vessel time. <b>Fish</b> <b>condition</b> was indicated by length-specific body weight. Growth rate indices were estimated for three different periods by using fish lengthage data and daily otolith increment widths: 1) from hatching date to capture, 2) 1 − 5 d before capture, and 3) 6 − 10 d before capture. Fish diet was determined from gut content analysis. Considerable variation among areas was evident in zooplankton composition, and <b>fish</b> <b>condition,</b> growth, and diet. However, relatively high prey densities, as well as <b>fish</b> <b>condition</b> and growth rates indicated that Chiniak Bay was particularly well suited as a pollock nursery.

40|$|Channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus is an {{important}} sport fish, particularly in the Great Plains. In Nebraska, a majority of anglers target channel catfish, and fishing activities are {{a vital part of}} the state’s economy. Lentic water bodies provide the primary fishing opportunity for catfish anglers in Nebraska. Despite the popularity and economic importance of channel catfish, little is known of its population dynamics or habitat requirements, and existing studies often profile river populations. Current standards for sampling channel catfish in lentic systems often yield inadequate catch to assess populations. The objective of this study was to utilize a recently developed sampling method, tandem-set hoop nets, to collect channel catfish in sufficient quantities to describe the effects of stocking and habitat variability on populations in lentic ecosystems. Three lentic ecosystems common to the Great Plains were considered: sand pits, flood-control reservoirs, and irrigation/power-generation reservoirs. The influence of stocking on abundance and condition of channel catfish varied with ecosystem type. In sand pits, stocking negatively influenced <b>fish</b> <b>condition,</b> and only frequent stocking positively influenced abundance. In flood-control reservoirs, stocking did not influence <b>fish</b> <b>condition,</b> but was associated with greater abundance. Stocking did not influence <b>fish</b> <b>condition</b> or abundance in irrigation/power-generation reservoirs. Additionally, there was evidence that mortality and growth rates varied with ecosystem type. In general, populations from irrigation/power-generation reservoirs were predicted to experience slower growth and lower mortality, whereas populations from sand pits were predicted to experience the fastest growth and highest mortality. Catch rates of channel catfish were substantially less in this study compared to previous records of tandem-set hoop net surveys, but hoop nets were more efficient than the current standard gear, experimental gill nets, at capturing channel catfish (i. e., 100 fish could be captured with fewer hoop net sets than gill net sets). However, catch rates and size structure of channel catfish in tandem-set hoop nets varied within the sampling season and between years. Furthermore, length-frequency distributions of channel catfish were dissimilar between hoop nets and gill nets. Adviser: Kevin L. Pop...|$|R
