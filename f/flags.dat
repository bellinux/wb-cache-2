5|$|Each of the 78 {{municipalities}} of Puerto Rico has adopted <b>flags</b> which represent {{the region and}} its people. Most of the designs of these <b>flags</b> derive their symbolism from the region's Coat of Arms. Most of the political parties in Puerto Rico also have their own <b>flags,</b> which represent and symbolize the political ideals of its members. These <b>flags</b> are usually displayed in public during rallies, meetings, or parades in show of political strength and unity. Various sports associations in Puerto Rico have adopted <b>flags</b> which represent them and which are also used during competitions and sports events.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Six <b>Flags</b> {{announced}} three The Dark Knight Coaster {{roller coasters}} {{would be built}} at Six <b>Flags</b> Great Adventure, Six <b>Flags</b> Great America, and Six <b>Flags</b> New England. Because Batman: The Dark Knight's name was so similar to the new roller coaster, it was renamed to Batman: The Ride. However, as construction on the new roller coaster progressed, the city of Agawam forced Six <b>Flags</b> to stop construction after it was discovered the park had not received the appropriate construction permits. In April 2008, Six <b>Flags</b> cancelled the project due to the delays and Batman: The Ride was renamed back to its original.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} recorded <b>flags</b> in Japan {{date from}} the unification period in the late 16th century. The <b>flags</b> belonged to each daimyō and were used primarily in battle. Most of the <b>flags</b> were long banners usually charged with the mon (family crest) of the daimyō lord. Members of the same family, such as a son, father, and brother, had different <b>flags</b> to carry into battle. The <b>flags</b> served as identification, and were displayed by soldiers on their backs and horses. Generals also had their own <b>flags,</b> most of which differed from soldiers' <b>flags</b> due to their square shape.|$|E
5000|$|The full <b>flag</b> {{featuring}} {{the sun is}} called the Official Ceremonial <b>Flag</b> (Bandera Oficial de Ceremonia).

5|$|This {{is a list}} of the <b>flags</b> of Puerto Rico. The <b>flags</b> of Puerto Rico {{represent}} and {{symbolize the}} island and people of Puerto Rico.

5|$|When {{flying the}} Lithuanian flag with other <b>flags,</b> the {{following}} is the correct order of precedence: The national flag, the historical (state) flag, <b>flags</b> of foreign states, {{the flag of the}} European Union, international NGOs, the presidential standard, military and government standards, county <b>flags,</b> city <b>flags</b> and any others. When foreign <b>flags</b> are used alongside the Lithuanian flag, the <b>flags</b> are sorted according to their countries' names in the Lithuanian language. The only exception is when the congress or meeting held in Lithuanian dictates a different language to be used for sorting. The European Union flag has been hoisted since Lithuania {{became a member of the}} organization. While not mentioned by name in the law, the flag of NATO can be used in Lithuania, since it belongs to that organization as well. It is also common to fly the <b>flags</b> of Estonia and Latvia during certain occasions, mainly the celebration of independence of the three Baltic states. The Law of the Republic of Lithuania on the National Flag and Other <b>Flags</b> governs the rules, use, protocol and manufacturing of the national and other <b>flags</b> used inside the country.|$|E
5|$|When the Indian flag is {{displayed}} with non-national <b>flags,</b> including corporate <b>flags</b> and advertising banners, the rules state {{that if the}} <b>flags</b> are on separate staffs, the flag of India {{should be in the}} middle, or the furthest left from the viewpoint of the onlookers, or at least one flag's breadth higher than the other <b>flags</b> in the group. Its flagpole must be {{in front of the other}} poles in the group, but if they are on the same staff, it must be the uppermost flag. If the flag is carried in procession with other <b>flags,</b> it must be at the head of the marching procession, or if carried with a row of <b>flags</b> in line abreast, it must be carried to the marching right of the procession.|$|E

The standard bearer must carry the flag high on his or her right shoulder.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} Polish <b>flags</b> are defined in current Polish {{national}} law, either through {{an act of}} parliament or a ministerial ordinance.

5|$|At the September 2011 {{meeting of}} the FIA World Motor Sport Council, representatives of the member organisations voted to amend the rules for double-waved yellow <b>flags</b> in all FIA-sanctioned championships.

50|$|Before 1952, the <b>flag</b> of Fujairah {{was plain}} red. In 1952, the emirate's name {{was added to}} the <b>flag,</b> and a red <b>flag</b> with a white border was adopted as an ensign.

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Newfoundland used the Union <b>Flag</b> as its provincial <b>flag</b> from 1952 until 1980; the blue triangles {{on the new}} <b>flag</b> adopted in 1980 are meant {{as a tribute to}} the Union <b>Flag.</b> British Columbia's <b>flag,</b> which {{features}} the Union <b>Flag</b> in its top portion, was introduced in 1960 and is actually based on the shield of the provincial coat of arms, which dates back to 1906. Hence, both Newfoundland's use of the Union <b>Flag</b> and the adoption of BC's <b>flag</b> are unrelated to (and, in fact, pre-date) the great <b>flag</b> debate.|$|R

When <b>flags</b> are required to be flown at half-staff, vertical <b>flags</b> are not lowered.
