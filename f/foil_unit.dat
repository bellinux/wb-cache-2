40|$|For CERN's Linac 4 (L 4) Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) {{injection}} scheme, {{slices of}} the 160 MeV H⁻ beam {{will be distributed}} to the 4 superposed synchrotron rings of the PSB. The beam will then be injected horizontally into the PSB {{by means of an}} H⁻ charge-exchange injection system using a graphite stripping foil to strip the electrons from the H⁻ ions. The foil and its positioning mechanism will be housed under vacuum inside a stripping <b>foil</b> <b>unit,</b> containing a set of six foils that can be mechanically rotated into the beam aperture. The band with mounted foils is controlled by a stepping motor while a resolver, micro-switches and a membrane potentiometer provide foil position feedback. The vicinity of the ionizing beam and vacuum requirements have constrained the selection of the above mentioned control system parts. The positioning and interlocking logic is implemented in an industrial Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). This paper describes the design of the stripping <b>foil</b> <b>unit</b> electronics and controls and presents the first results obtained from a test bench unit which will be installed in the Linac 4 transfer line {{by the end of the}} 2015 for foil tests with beam...|$|E

40|$|The Planet {{universal}} {{critical assembly}} machine {{was used to}} perform {{a series of three}} critical experiments. This experiment used HEU foils reflected by polyethylene and interleaved with plates of SiO{sub 2 } glass and polyethylene. Only the experiment performed using the SiO{sub 2 } matrix material is evaluated in this report. The assembly was delayed critical with 33 HEU <b>foils</b> or 17 <b>units</b> (sets of HEU foils). The critical assembly has an intermediate neutron spectrum, with 51. 2 % of the fissions occurring between 0. 625 eV and 100 keV. The calculational results show good agreement with the experimental results...|$|R
5000|$|Faced with {{criticism}} for not thoroughly pursuing available evidence in 2006, the Met {{asserted that the}} Royal Household/Goodman inquiry was limited [...] "because the counter-terrorism unit, which {{was in charge of}} the case, was preoccupied with more pressing demands." [...] According to deputy assistant commissioner Peter Clark, the unit then had [...] "more than 70 live operations relating to terrorist plots but some of these were not being investigated because there were not enough officers to do so." [...] Assistant commissioner John Yates pointed to the fact that, two days after Mucaire was arrested, the counter-terrorism <b>unit</b> <b>foiled</b> an Al-Qaeda plan to blow up transatlantic airliners.|$|R

Leyden jars were later made by coating the inside and outside of jars with metal foil, leaving a space at the mouth to prevent arcing between the <b>foils.</b> The earliest <b>unit</b> of capacitance was the jar, equivalent to about 1.11 nanofarads.|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of energetic (multi-GeV) heavy ion beams by acceleration of ultra-thin foils {{through the application}} of radiation pressure to a self-generated, imperfect plasma mirror (photon absorption probability η finite) is studied. To evaluate the foil dynamics a relativistic model was developed for a constant and relativistic invariant value of the phenomenological parameter η. The achievable efficiency of kinetic energy transfer to the matter has been evaluated as function of the parameters involved (η, the aimed average <b>foil</b> velocity in <b>unit</b> of the light speed β, etc.). The expected collimation degree for the generated ion beams, the associated energy range, the self-consistency of the model in view of the η finite value and the survival to R-T instability were evaluated for initially thin material disks.

A radio frequency identification (RFID) -chip is arranged at or in the <b>foil.</b> A coupling <b>unit</b> is connected with the RFID-chip over a connection line. The sticker has a tensile strength, which is low so that the sticker is teared or rippled during separation of a substrate.

40|$|The 2 × 2 array HEU-Re {{experiment}} {{was performed on}} the Planet universal critical assembly machine on November 4 th, 2003 at the Los Alamos Critical Experiments Facility (LACEF) at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). For this experiment, there were 10 ½ units, each full unit containing four HEU foils and two rhenium <b>foils.</b> The top <b>unit</b> contained only two HEU foils and two rhenium foils. A total of 42 HEU foils were used for this experiment. Rhenium is a desirable cladding material for space nuclear power applications. This experiment consisted of HEU foils interleaved with rhenium foils and is moderated and reflected by polyethylene plates. A unit consisted of a polyethylene plate, which has a recess for rhenium foils, and four HEU foils {{in a single layer in}} the top recess of each polyethylene plate. The Planet universal criticality assembly machine has been previously used in experiments containing HEU foils interspersed with SiO 2 (HEU-MET-THERM- 001), Al (HEU-MET-THERM- 008), MgO (HEU-MET-THERM- 009), Gd foils (HEU-MET-THERM- 010), 2 × 2 × 26 Al (HEU-MET-THERM- 012), Fe (HEU-MET-THERM- 013 and HEU-MET-THERM- 015), 2 × 2 × 23 SiO 2 (HEU-MET-THERM- 014), 2 × 2 × 11 hastalloy plates (HEU-MET-THERM- 016), and concrete (HEU-MET-THERM- 018). The 2 × 2 array of HEU-Re is considered acceptable for use as a benchmark critical experiment...|$|R
40|$|The {{ionization}} efficiency {{is one of}} the most important parameters of an on-line used target-ion source system exploited for production of exotic radioactive beams. The {{ionization efficiency}} value determination as a characteristic of a target-ion source unit in the stage of its normalizing before on-line use is a very important step in the course of the preparation for an on-line experiment. At the IRIS facility (Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute, Gatchina) a reliable and rather precise method of the target-ion source unit ionization efficiency measurement by the method of stable beam implantation has been developed. The method worked out exploits an off-line mass-separator for the implantation of the ion beams of selected stable isotopes of different elements into a tantalum foil placed inside the Faraday cup in the focal plane of the mass-separator. The amount of implanted ions has been measured with a high accuracy by the current integrator connected to the Faraday cup. After the implantation of needed amount of the investigated specie, tantalum foil has been implemented into the volume of the target-ion source unit prepared for the on-line utilization at the IRIS on-line separator. For the <b>foil</b> implementation the <b>unit</b> is equipped by a window, which is being closed by a plug after the inserting the tantalum foil with the defined amount of atoms of the measured specimen into the target volume. The first tests with the method used have supplied the ionization efficiency values (90 &# 61617; 20) % for Rb and (85 &# 61617; 20) % for Cs in the empty combined target-ion source unit, which was used as a reference one. For the combined target-ion source unit with UC target material inside prepared for on-line experiment the measured value of the ionization efficiency was (52 &# 61617; 20) %, that likely can be explained by the carbonization of the inner surface of the target container that brings to the decrease of its work function...|$|R
