25|$|Microwave heating is more {{efficient}} on liquid water than on frozen water, where the movement of molecules is more restricted. <b>Dielectric</b> <b>heating</b> of liquid water is also temperature-dependent: At 0 °C, dielectric loss is greatest at a field frequency of about 10 GHz, and for higher water temperatures at higher field frequencies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{feasibility}} of performing a cohort study on health risks from occupational exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) in Germany. Methods A set of criteria was developed to evaluate the feasibility of such a cohort study. The criteria aimed at conditions of exposure and exposure assessment (level, duration, preferably on an individual basis), the possibility to assemble a cohort and the feasibility of ascertaining various disease endpoints. Results Twenty occupational settings with workers potentially exposed to RF-EMF and, in addition, a cohort of amateur radio operators were considered. Based on expert ratings, literature reviews and our set of predefined criteria, three of the cohorts were identified as promising for further evaluation: the personnel (technicians) of medium/short wave broadcasting stations, amateur radio operators, and workers on <b>dielectric</b> <b>heat</b> sealers. After further analyses, the cohort of workers on <b>dielectric</b> <b>heat</b> sealers seems not to be feasible due to the small number of exposed workers available and to the difficulty of assessing exposure (exposure depends heavily on the respective working process and mixture of exposures, e. g. plastic vapours), although exposure was highest in this occupational setting. The advantage of the cohort of amateur radio operators was the large number of persons it includes, while the advantage of the cohort of personnel working at broadcasting stations was the quality of retrospective exposure assessment. However, in the cohort of amateur radio operators the exposure assessment was limited, and the cohort of technicians was hampered by the small number of persons working in this profession. Conclusion The majority of occupational groups exposed to RF-EMF are not practicable for setting up an occupational cohort study due to the small numbers of exposed subjects or due to exposure levels being only marginally higher than those of the general public. </p...|$|R

25|$|Methods of {{electric}} heating include resistance heating, electric arc heating, induction heating, and <b>dielectric</b> <b>heating.</b> In some processes (for example, arc welding), electric current is directly {{applied to the}} workpiece. In other processes, heat is produced within the workpiece by induction or dielectric losses. As well, heat can be produced then transferred to the work by conduction, convection or radiation.|$|E
2500|$|However, lower-frequency <b>dielectric</b> <b>heating,</b> as {{described}} in the aforementioned patent, is (like induction heating) an electromagnetic heating effect, the result of the so-called near-field effects that exist in an electromagnetic cavity that is small compared with the wavelength of the electromagnetic field. This patent proposed radio frequency heating, at 10 to 20 megahertz (wavelength 15 to 30 meters). Heating from microwaves that have a wavelength that is small relative to the cavity (as in a modern microwave oven) is due to [...] "far-field" [...] effects that are due to classical electromagnetic radiation that describes freely propagating light and microwaves suitably far from their source. Nevertheless, the primary heating effect of all types of electromagnetic fields at both radio and microwave frequencies occurs via the <b>dielectric</b> <b>heating</b> effect, as polarized molecules are affected by a rapidly alternating electric field.|$|E

2500|$|There are, however, a {{few cases}} where people {{have been exposed to}} direct {{microwave}} radiation, either from appliance malfunction or deliberate action.

2500|$|A {{microwave}} oven cooks or heats food by <b>dielectric</b> <b>heating.</b> Cooking food with microwaves {{was discovered by}} Percy Spencer on October 8, 1945, while building magnetrons for radar sets at Raytheon. Spencer was working on an active radar set when he noticed a strange sensation, and saw that a peanut candy bar {{he had in his}} pocket started to melt. Although he was not the first to notice this phenomenon, as the holder of 120 patents, Spencer was no stranger to discovery and experiment, and realized what was happening. The radar had melted his candy bar with microwaves. The first food to be deliberately cooked with microwaves was popcorn, and the second was an egg. In 1947, Raytheon under Percy Spencer demonstrated the world's first {{microwave oven}} built at the company which was called the [...] "Radarange".|$|E
2500|$|A {{microwave}} oven heats food by passing microwave radiation through it. [...] Microwaves are {{a form of}} non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation with a frequency higher than ordinary radio waves but lower than infrared light. [...] Microwave ovens use frequencies {{in one of the}} ISM (industrial, scientific, medical) bands, which are reserved for this use, so they do not interfere with other vital radio services. [...] Consumer ovens usually use 2.45 gigahertz (GHz)—a wavelength of —while large industrial/commercial ovens often use 915 megahertz (MHz)—. Water, fat, and other substances in the food absorb energy from the microwaves in a process called <b>dielectric</b> <b>heating.</b> Many molecules (such as those of water) are electric dipoles, meaning that they have a partial positive charge at one end and a partial negative charge at the other, and therefore rotate as they try to align themselves with the alternating electric field of the microwaves. Rotating molecules hit other molecules and put them into motion, thus dispersing energy. This energy, when dispersed as molecular vibration in solids and liquids (i.e. as both potential energy and kinetic energy of atoms), is heat. Sometimes, microwave heating is explained as a resonance of water molecules, but this is incorrect; such resonances occur only at above 1 terahertz (THz). Rather it is the lag in response of the polar water molecule to the impinging electromagnetic wave. This type of dielectric loss mechanism is referred to as dipole interaction.|$|E

Although the analysis in this paper cannot explain the phenomenon described in [Gross & Porter(1966) ], it could be because of unavailability of accurate physical parameters of the fluid used in the experiment...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of <b>dielectric</b> <b>heat</b> transfer {{in the catalytic}} cracking and hydrocracking of gas oils has been investigated. A three-phase spouted-bed catalytic reactor has been designed and operated using dielectric radio frequency (RF) heating. The electromagnetic power {{was transferred to the}} reactor by a 27. 12 MHz RF generator acting through two capacitor plates. In this technique, heat is generated to the catalyst held in the electromagnetic field and thermal energy dissipated to the surroundings of the catalyst volume preventing carbon formation by eliminating secondary reactions. Energy transfer from the RF filed to the reaction was solely dependent on the dielectric properties of solids in the reactor, effectively the catalyst or transient carbon. Three zeolitic catalysts have been tested. These catalysts were 13 X, 5 A and Ammonium Y Zeolite. Two different gas oils have been used as feedstocks for the experiments. Saudi Light Vacuum Gas Oil (SALVGO) supplied by Saudi Aramco Oil and North Sea Light Gas Oil (BPLGO) supplied by BP Oil. A comparative study of the two gas oils cracked over 13 X zeolitic catalyst has been presented.

40|$|International audienceAn {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the performance of thermosyphons charged with water as well as the <b>dielectric</b> <b>heat</b> transfer liquids FC- 84, FC- 77 and FC- 3283 has been carried out. The copper thermosyphon was 200 mm long with an inner diameter of 6 mm, which can be considered quite small compared with the vast majority of thermosyphons reported in the open literature. The evaporator length was 40 mm and the condenser length was 60 mm which corresponds with what might be expected in compact heat exchangers. With water as the working fluid two fluid loadings were investigated, that being 0. 6 ml and 1. 8 ml, corresponding to approximately half filled and overfilled evaporator section in order to ensure combined pool boiling and thin film evaporation/boiling and pool boiling only conditions respectively. For the Flourinert liquids, only the higher fill volume was tested as the aim was to investigate pool boiling opposed to thin film evaporation. Generally, the water charged thermosyphon evaporator and condenser heat transfer characteristics compared well with available predictive correlations and theories. The thermal performance of the water charged thermosyphon also outperformed the other three working fluids in both the effective thermal resistance as well as maximum heat transport capabilities. Even so, FC- 84, the lowest saturation temperature fluid tested, shows marginal improvement in the heat transfer at low operating temperatures. All of the tested Flourinert liquids offer the advantage of being dielectric fluids, which may be better suited for sensitive electronics cooling applications and were all found to provide adequate thermal performance up to approximately 30 - 50 W after which liquid entrainment compromised their performance...|$|R
