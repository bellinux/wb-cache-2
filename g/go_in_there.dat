25|$|The {{whole notion}} of {{politics}} is they always present you with this or this or this. I'll get a newspaper to read between the lines. Why {{do you have to}} adhere to prescribed formulas that they have and people argue over them and they're all in a box. And you watch Fox claw CNN, and CNN claw Fox. Sometimes I catch a piece of the news and it seems insanity to me. I quietly support candidates. I'm not out there banging a drum for candidates. But I have supported a candidate and it's a whole other world. Once you've been exposed to it, once or twice or however many times, if you know the facts and see how they're presented, it's mind-boggling. It's a very scary arena to be in, but I do vote. I <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and pull the lever. It's kind of like pulling the lever and watching the trap door fall out from beneath you. Why should we trust any of these people? None of them ever deliver on anything. It's always disappointing.|$|E
500|$|While {{recording}} her demo album, Swift {{worked with}} demo producer Nathan Chapman, whom she {{met in a}} little shed behind a publishing company she was at. Swift said, [...] "I'd always <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and play him some new songs, and the next week he would have this awesome track, on which he played every instrument, and {{it sounded like a}} record. We did this for a period of a year to two years before I got my record deal." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Tea Leaves" [...] {{was written}} by Matthew Weiner and Erin Levy and {{directed}} by series star Jon Hamm. This is the first episode of the series that Jon Hamm had directed, with Hamm saying that he owes thanks to John Slattery for paving the way. As preparation for directing the Rolling Stones concert, Hamm looked over archival photographs of the original concert. [...] "They were kids. The Rolling Stones. It was them and The Beatles. These huge pop explosions. People were really excited about {{it and it was}} a really big deal. And, in a larger sense, gave us a sense of where advertising is going." [...] Reflecting on his directing job, Hamm noted that he tried not to put much distracting style into the show, explaining that [...] "My job was not to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and muck it up and say, [...] "I'm gonna put my stamp on this." [...] My job was to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and keep the train on the tracks, basically. We have a very firmly established tone and look to our show that people respond to, and that I love." [...] Although the third episode of the season, it was actually the first episode produced for season, prior to the two-part season premiere, [...] "A Little Kiss".|$|E

500|$|The group {{initially}} invited Feldmann to hear its demos, and {{he suggested}} that the band regroup at his studio {{the next day to}} make a fresh start. The next day, the group wrote three songs, including the lead single [...] "Bored to Death". As the band continued to write and record, the trio chose to shelve their earlier recordings and proceeded to write 28 songs in a period of 3â€“4 weeks. Half of these songs were chosen to be put on the finalized album, in addition to two joke songs. Barker fought for all 28 songs to be on the album, as he felt fans had waited long enough for more new music. The trio, as well as Feldmann, regularly stayed in the studio for up to 18 hours a day. The band members would arrive at the studio with no plan for what to work on for the day. They would then write several songs in only a few hours, aiming to complete them {{by the end of the}} night. Feldmann asked the members to consider what Blink-182, as a group, are all about, to inspire the songwriting. He would encourage the musicians to write with speed, which Hoppus admitted could be frustrating. [...] "John was like, 'Okay: We've got the song structure. Write lyrics. <b>Go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and sing it. <b>Go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and sing it.' Sometimes, I was like, 'I'm not ready to sing!' (and Feldmann would reply) 'No. Go write something great right now!'" [...] Barker was more supportive of this method based on his work with the Transplants, which had a similar speedy approach. [...] "I always feel like your first instinct is your best," [...] Barker remarked.|$|E
500|$|After three minutes, Madonna {{performs}} a rap naming {{the people who}} are working for her. Basically, we [...] had recorded the whole song and we had this instrumental thing at the end," [...] said Madonna, [...] "and Mirwais was like, 'You know what, you have to go and do a rap.' And I was like, 'Get out of here, I don't rap.' And he was like, 'Yeah you do. Just <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> just do it.' He totally encouraged me. I had nothing planned, nothing written, and he just told me to do stream-of-consciousness, whatever I was thinking. Because I was always drinking soy lattes in the studio, and I drive my Mini Cooper to the studio, I was just like, 'OK, let me just talk about the things that I like.' So I went and it was just total improv and obviously it was sloppy at first, but I got out all my thoughts and then I wrote everything down that I said and then I perfected the timing of it. So it was totally spontaneous." ...|$|E
500|$|Lopez later {{confirmed}} {{in an interview}} On Air with Ryan Seacrest, that the completed music video would premiere jointly on season ten of American Idol and on Vevo on March 3,2011. Fans could vote between three alternative endings through Idols official website. Lopez said the idea behind giving fans the choice was {{to give them a}} chance to see what she experienced. [...] "You get to do what I do,... Like, I <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> with my videos and I start editing and picking all the shots I like and the things that I like and what I feel the best kind of feeling for the record is. You guys get to do that. We picked two different ones and we weren't sure." [...] The alternative endings included three varying scenes: in the first, the video ends with a close-up of Lopez's face in the silver lace catsuit; the second ends with a shot of dancers defying gravity on the walls and ceiling, while the final ending ends with a shot of Lopez on the dance floor in her harem pants. The first ending was the one used in the final video.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know the}} place. Week-night {{services}} and hymn-singing and preaching. A cold, desolate affair altogether. I'm thankful I <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> though, for it's given me an idea." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] replied Rollo. [...] "It is {{open all}} the time, {{and people are}} all the time going and coming. We <b>went</b> <b>in.</b> <b>There</b> was an old woman sitting just inside the door, {{with a string of}} beads in her hands, {{counting}} them. There were two or three other old women there, knitting. I could not see much of the inside of the church when we first <b>went</b> <b>in,</b> <b>there</b> were so many columns; but I could hear the birds flying about and singing away up high among the vaults and arches." ...|$|R
500|$|British-Tamil {{recording}} artist M.I.A. {{was one of}} the songwriters of [...] "Elastic Love". According to her, [...] "Elastic Love" [...] was the first track that she recorded, even before she started working on her debut album. She added, [...] "It's the one I made in-between taking time out and having a baby and starting mine". When was asked about why she agreed to work with Aguilera, M.I.A. revealed, [...] "Other people were involved who I respect like Peaches and it was like a sea of women coming together to write this new thing. Christina had also had a baby, you know, so it was kind of an interesting situation". Aguilera's decision not to perform her [...] "trademark warbling" [...] while recording the song disappointed M.I.A., as she detailed in an interview with MTV News UK:I really thought I {{was going to be able}} to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and get her vocals on to the next level and she didn't want to do it. She was like 'You might think that's great because it's not what you do, but to me I'm really bored of it'. It's interesting getting to work with people who can do things vocally that you can't... but yeah I only heard the song for the first time when everyone else did.|$|E
500|$|Madonna also enlisted American {{professional}} boxer Mike Tyson to give {{a speech}} that would be used on the track. According to the singer, [...] "I was thinking: who is in my eyes super iconic, who do I look up to, who is alive today that's been through what I feel like I've been through, that's been through a lot, survived, has stories to tell, has evolved as human being [...] is a survivor, his name came to mind right away." [...] She also revealed that she was moved and impressed after seen his HBO-documentary [...] "Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth", directed by Spike Lee and contacted him. Tyson revealed that he ad-libbed his part of the song in one take and was inspired by Benito Mussolini, who Tyson admitted that was seen as arrogant, but he tried to come from a positive perspective and be uplifting. In an interview for Rolling Stone he explained: [...] "I didn't know what the hell I was going there for. I'm just there having a good time and hanging out with Madonna. She has her producer there and I go into the studio and I didn't know if she wanted me to talk or rap. I just <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and start talking. I'm talking about my life and things that I have endured. I'm saying some really crazy stuff. It was really intense." ...|$|E
2500|$|Soomekh became {{close with}} Lionsgate after {{appearing}} in their film Crash (2004) {{and they wanted}} her in their next big film. Not a fan of horror films she found the role challenging. [...] "I had nightmares the first month I was on set. We were shooting it for two months. People say because you're an actor it's {{not a big deal}} because you <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and it's fake or whatever. But what they don't understand is that it's actually the opposite because, as an actor, when you <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> you have to believe it's real to make your performance real. You have to get lost in the mindframe of this character", she said.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Don Imus, Paul was asked for {{his view of the}} Gaza flotilla raid. He responded, [...] "... I think it's absolutely wrong to prevent people that are starving and having problems, that are almost like in concentration camps, and saying yes we endorse this whole concept that we can't allow ships to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> in a humanitarian way..." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Governor, Palin vetoed {{public funding}} for private, Christian schools, saying after the fact, [...] "I'm a Christian.... unconstitutional. It's illegal. You can't do that. I had to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and veto those things and, of course, was accused then of being, 'Oh, you're {{not a real}} {{conservative}} or a real Republican. Otherwise, you would have fought for that.' No, illegal is illegal." ...|$|E
2500|$|He wrote briefly for {{publishing}} house Robbins Music and producer Mickie Most in 1967, and then shifted base to the Kennedy Street Enterprises show business management offices in Manchester. He remained there for four years, recalling: [...] "It {{was like an}} office. I used to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> every morning at 10 o'clock and stay there, working on my songs, until I finished every evening at six o'clock. It was self-discipline and I need that." ...|$|E
60|$|Then I got {{up with a}} soul full of rage, and <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> {{and bent}} scowling over that person, and began a {{succession}} of rude and raspy questions--and without even offering to sit down.|$|R

2500|$|McFadden {{was educated}} {{and is now}} a teacher at Saint Eunan's College in Letterkenny, where the success of the 2012 Donegal senior {{football}} team has lifted the spirits of staff, including mathematical whiz Edward Harvey - seen on RTÃ‰ with an enormous grin on his face {{at the end of the}} semi-final against Cork. McFadden told the Irish Examiner, [...] "Eddie Harvey said to me last year when he was in the leisure centre, he'd pop into the jacuzzi and everyone would be talking doom and gloom and the recession. Last summer and this year too, he said he could <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and all anyone would talk about was football. It's great to hear." ...|$|E
2500|$|Of {{his initial}} meeting with President Bush {{regarding}} the surge, Keane said {{he made a}} phone call to Newt Gingrich to ask his advice prior to the meeting. As Keane said in 2014, Gingrich gave me some good advice. He said, [...] "Look, Jack. Most people go in the Oval Office, even people who <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> a lot, have a tendency in front of the President of the United States to always leave something on the table." [...] He said, [...] "Donâ€™t leave anything on the table." [...] He said, [...] "Youâ€™re going to get about 15 minutes at best and put it all out there. And when you walk out of that room, feel good that you got it all out there." [...] So that was sound advice, and I did put it all out there.|$|E
2500|$|Project 86 has {{sometimes}} been labeled a [...] "Christian band", although the band itself eschewed the label. The band considers its art {{to be the best}} conveyance of their message. Frontman Andrew Schwab has offered several statements on the topic. [...] "We're not going to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and say 'Hey we're the Christian band. We're going to carry ourselves like a normal band. Hopefully people will like our music and investigate into the band [...] and they will learn our beliefs." [...] "If we're playing at Ozzfest or on Family Values...," [...] the band told 7ball after the release of their second album, [...] "there is a greater level of tact necessary in order to reach that sort of audience." [...] In a 2007 interview, Schwab further opined [...] "We always tell people that the goal has been to just write music that we love, and write music hopefully that is challenging and inspiring to people and doesn't sound like everything else out there." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Mr. Quatermain shot {{more than}} well. His {{performance}} in the Lake covert was the most brilliant that I have ever seen. When you <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> together, Sir Junius, you were thirty ahead of him, and you fired seventeen more cartridges at the stand." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{shut-down}} of the Army facility {{proved the}} last straw for Truman. [...] On the evening of July 23, Truman ordered the steelmakers and the union {{to meet in the}} White House the following day and settle the strike. At 10:00a.m. on July 24, Murray and Fairless were ushered into the Oval Office. Truman informed the two men of top-secret statistics which showed the U.S. war effort in Korea was being crippled. The President then told Fairless: [...] "You can settle this thing, Ben, and you've got to settle it. I want it settled by tomorrow morning, or I will have some things to say that you won't like to hear, and I will have to do some things you won't like." [...] Fairless started in surprise. Truman then turned to Murray and said, [...] "Phil, you've got to settle this thing too. Now <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> in the Cabinet room, and I want you to come out with a settlement." [...] The two men adjourned to the Cabinet Room. At 4:45p.m., Fairless and Murray told the President that they had reached an agreement. Steelman witnessed its signing.|$|E
2500|$|Rooney explained: [...] "We {{had changed}} the sound of Jennifer Lopez [...] and we didn't have {{anything}} else on the [...] album we could release as a single. We had to do another remix to keep the momentum going." [...] Then-upcoming artist Ashanti dropped by Irv Gotti's studio in New York. She recalled: [...] "Everyone was there and Ja [...] {{was on the floor}} playing video games, and they had the beat playing in the background. Chris Gotti, Irv Gotti's brother, said 'Ja's supposed to be writing this record for J-Lo, but it doesn't look like he's going to be doing anything tonight. Why don't you <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and see what's happening?' So that's exactly what I did." [...] Ashanti wrote two verses and recorded a demo for the new version of [...] "Ain't It Funny" [...] for Lopez. Gotti and 7 flew out to Los Angeles on September 10, 2001 to record the song with Lopez. The song was due to be recorded the following day, but was postponed due to the September 11 attacks. When work resumed on the song, Gotti called Ashanti from Los Angeles asking her to write another verse for the song. She recalled: [...] "I had to write it over the phone and two-way Irv the lyrics." ...|$|E
2500|$|When casting for the film, Iliadis {{wanted to}} find actors who would not portray these {{characters}} in a stereotypical way. As Craven explains, they wanted someone who would take these characters {{in a direction that}} most actors would notâ€”they wanted originality. Craven states, [...] "You need an actor who can bring a complete sense of commitment to that character without making it silly and not be afraid to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> to the point where someone might say, 'Oh, you got bad in you?' You have to be brave enough and mature enough to know we've all got it, and you're not afraid of putting it out there and if you've got a problem with seeing that, tough." [...] For instance, Iliadis wanted to avoid casting some superficially sexy actress in the role of Mari, because he did not want the rape sequence to appear enjoyable to the viewers in any possible way. Iliadis notes that when Sara Paxton came in her audition was [...] "good", but it was this sense of intelligence and intensity that Paxton brought with her. The actress also had the [...] "innocent face" [...] the director was looking for, someone who had this [...] "wholesomely American look" [...] that would not allow anyone to enjoy watching her go through these intense events.|$|E
