40|$|For generations, {{the harvest}} of native flora and fauna by Māori was guided by tikanga. In the art of weaving, the {{sustainability}} of the culture was greatly dependant on the careful practice of harvest to ensure the maintenance of resources for future generations – also known as kaitiakitanga. One {{of the most important}} weaving materials was the kiekie (Freycinetia banksii). Under tikanga, the traditional method of harvest was to use a <b>hand</b> <b>wrench.</b> This method, it was argued, encouraged vigorous replenishment of the harvested stem, thus mediating human impacts on the resource. However, over the last decade it has arisen that a minority of harvesters may be adopting non-traditional techniques which involve the removal of the entire leaf head. Consequently, patches are slow to recover, and in some cases, the affected stems perish. Despite these observations, there is {{little in the way of}} quantitative data. As a result, Te Roopu Raranga Whatu o Aotearoa instigated this research to investigate harvesting practices and their impacts on kiekie. Over 1. 5 years, I tested whether traditional harvest was the most appropriate method by measuring how different harvesting techniques affected the recovery of harvested stems at two sites – one at Te Kotuku Whakaoka (Lake Brunner) on the west coast of the South Island, and the second in the Kaimai Ranges, west of Rotorua, in the North Island. Sixty stems at each site were treated with one of three different harvest regimes – a traditional <b>hand</b> <b>wrench</b> that removed approx. one-third of the stem tip biomass and was conducted over two different seasons ((1) spring and (2) autumn), and (3) a non-traditional harvest technique removing 100 % of the stem tip biomass with loppers. An additional investigation was conducted to evaluate the recovery of kiekie after goat browse. To simulate herbivory, 50 % of the total leaf area of the stem tip was removed from twenty of the sixty treatment stems. Results showed that the herbivory treatments significantly slowed new leaf production on the stems, when compared to controls. Overall, costs of harvest were higher for the non-traditional method than the traditional techniques. Nontraditionally harvested stems had a poorer recovery, with 20 % dying, and only 27 % of the remaining stems regenerating with an average of 1. 73 side shoots. In comparison, the two traditionally hand wrenched stems produced an average of 2. 35 (Spring Wrench) and 2. 55 (Autumn Wrench) side shoots. Findings also showed that traditionally hand wrenched stems are recovering back lost resources. One and a half years after harvest, the Spring Wrench shoots had recovered 70 % of the removed biomass (dry weight). Average leaf lengths of the three longest shoot leaves on all side shoots per wrench stem were at ~ 38 % of mature leaf size. One year after harvest Autumn Wrench shoots had recovered 2. 7 % of the removed biomass (dry weight) and shoot leaves were at ~ 19 % of mature leaf size. Consequently, both are capable of photosynthate synthesis and supply. Measurements did indicate however, that recovery may be sped up in the Autumn Wrench stems which produced more new shoot leaves on all side shoots than the Spring Wrench stems one year after harvest (32. 1 and 26. 9 shoot leaves respectively); although these results apply to a short research period and could be enhanced by a longer-term study. The findings validate the concerns of weavers regarding the negative impacts of non-traditional harvest on the sustainability of kiekie resources. Furthermore, there is support for tikanga regarding kiekie harvest. The regeneration of stocks shows that of all the harvest techniques investigated, the traditional modes of harvest are the most effective means of mediating the impacts of human harvest on kiekie...|$|E

5000|$|Many {{applications}} use {{air driven}} or {{electric impact wrench}} or impact driver to deliver the amount of shock and torque required to tighten or loosen the different bolts or nuts in use. Inside an impact wrench there is a rotating hammer, usually driven by electricity or air pressure, {{that is used to}} incrementally rotate the output shaft. The impact wrench is designed to deliver high torque output with minimal exertion by the user, by storing energy in a rotating mass, then delivering it suddenly to the output shaft via a hammering action. While typical impact wrenches deliver between 500 and 1500 ft-lbs of torque, some larger impact wrenches such as the Ingersoll Rand 599A1 can deliver near 80,000 ft-lb (10850 Nm) of torque which is enough to tighten hex nuts 7" [...] across flats. Even if the socket attached to the impact wrench does not turn, it is still subjected to successive shock blows by the impact wrench's internal hammer(s). These successive blows are often enough to loosen or tighten a tight or corroded nut or bolt or in some cases break or strip the fastener. Impact wrenches are hard on the sockets since the sockets in use also get hammered. Regular chrome plated [...] "hand sockets" [...] like those commonly included with <b>hand</b> ratchet <b>wrench</b> tool sets are not suitable for this kind of high load impact application. Hand sockets, when used with an impact wrench, can break or shatter explosively if they are used with an impact wrench. Impact sockets are specifically designed and manufactured for impact gun use, and are nearly always made from a thicker, tougher and more ductile alloy steel that is then heat treated for extra durability. Most impact sockets made for [...] "standard" [...] hexagonal fasteners have a six-point design. For more flexibility many impact sockets are made with swivel type socket—socket wrench attachment geometry. These impact sockets are rarely, if ever, chrome-plated, as chrome will chip off under impact use, and the process of chrome plating hardened steel causes some hydrogen embrittlement which can cause parts to crack. Instead, impact sockets are most commonly finished with a black oxide surface or other conversion treatment to provide some corrosion and rust protection and improved appearance even after hard impact wrench use. Although ordinary hand sockets should never be used with impact wrenches, impact sockets can be used with <b>hand</b> socket <b>wrenches</b> and other <b>hand</b> drivers.|$|R

30|$|Unfortunately, {{disturbances}} such as fire {{may increase}} the likelihood of invasion by non-native species. Disturbance-mediated reductions in basal area (Von Holle and Simberloff 2005, Belote et al. 2008), including high-severity fires, {{may increase the}} invasion potential of sites for non-native species (Hunter et al. 2006, Fornwalt et al. 2010). For instance, Belote et al. (2008) found higher species richness of both native and non-native species in areas of reduced basal area. Similarly, we found fire severity (inversely related to basal area) to significantly affect species richness for both native and non-native species. We predicted here that areas with lower residual basal area following fire could experience an increased likelihood of invasion by the non-native princess tree. The absence of princess tree stems on our study plots in 2016 indicated that effective removal was achievable through repeated (four consecutive years) direct management efforts closely following canopy disturbance. Removal treatments (<b>hand</b> pulling, <b>wrenching</b> from the soil, or stem clipping) implemented by the USDA Forest Service targeted princess tree seedlings following the wildfire. In year one, princess tree stem density was 3662 (± 1144 SD) stems ha− 1, but by year thre princess tree stem density had been reduced to 631 (± 293 SD) stems ha− 1 after three treatments.

40|$|The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Servicing Missions have {{demonstrated}} that extravehicular activity (EVA) power tools need a hand (non-powered) ratcheting capability to accomplish delicate and unforeseen tasks. Depending on the pitch, or spacing of the teeth on a conventional ratcheting <b>hand</b> socket <b>wrench,</b> sometimes more then 1 / 8 th of a turn in the backward direction can be required to engage the next tooth. This minimum motion requirement of the ratcheting device causes the wrench to work inefficiently in confined spaces. Furthermore, the bulkiness of an astronaut’s space suit and gloves causes additional range-of-motion problems when ratcheting wrench tools are used for EVA tasks. Therefore, removing the ratchet from the design can increase the usability of future EVA tools. No successful ratchet-less wrench has been developed to date. However, the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has developed and patented a special three dimensional (3 -D) roller locking Sprag technology that, when used {{in place of the}} traditional ratcheting mechanism, results in a device with infinite indexibility and infinitely small range-of-motion. This unique geometry permits construction of compact locking mechanisms that can withstand large loads because the Sprags are very small but have large contact radii and therefore, low contact stress. During the summer of 1997, GSFC developed and tested the use of this 3 -D sprag technology in commercial hand “ratcheting ” tools to create a commercial “ratchetless ” Sprag wrench. The Space Systems Laboratory (SSL) at the University of Maryland is extending this commercial Sprag wrench development to EVA tools. In order for the Sprag mechanism to become an EVA tool it must first be tested in a weightless environment to evaluate performance when used for certain tasks.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} politicizing participatory policy processes for civil society groups operating in Venezuela’s environment of extreme polarization. It uses Hirschman’s notions of Exit, Voice, and Loyalty (Hirschman, 1970) to interpret how grassroots groups called Mesas Tecnicas de Agua (MTAs) structure their collective action {{in light of the}} political opportunity structure. I find that processes of ideological-and partisan-based politicization have created a context where “loyalty ” activates repertoires of “voice ” that in turn range in their critical nature. Indeed, because the costs of dissent are very high in a polarized political situation, even MTAs that are critical supporters of the government do not consider the option of “exit ” viable. Unpacking how MTAs with different organizational origins structure their collective action casts light on changes in civic-partisan relations and shows the constructive role that ¨voice ¨ can play in maintaining a particular pattern in state-society relations. 1 Government propaganda describes the figure of the Mesa Tecnicas de Agua, translated as a Technical Water Committee, as a “tool of the revolution. ” The catchy phrase usually appears alongside a red, blue and yellow graphic (the Venezuelan flag’s colors) of <b>hands</b> griping a <b>wrench</b> from either side...|$|R
