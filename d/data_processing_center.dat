With the establishment of graduate studies and professional schools, the school gradually became more oriented toward scientific research. The School of Medicine was developed primarily as a research institution, {{the first of its}} kind on the West Coast. SWAC, one of the nation's first large computers, powered by vacuum tubes, was built at UCLA in 1950. IBM established the Western <b>Data</b> <b>Processing</b> <b>Center</b> at UCLA in 1956, an early support and regional training center for the use of computers for quantitative research. Other primitive computers obtained by the Center for Health Sciences and Department of Engineering were linked with SWAC to form an early Campus Computing Network.|$|E

2500|$|Sweden became highly {{urbanized}} after World War II, reaching 83% urban in 1990 and 85% today. As {{recently as}} 1940 only 38% {{of the population}} lived in urban areas, and in 1860, before industrialization, the proportion was only 11%. Large-scale movement from the countryside to the United States ended about 1900. Since 1945 the movement to Swedish cities has accelerated and has brought about a population decline in many areas, especially in the north. Most cities are small. Only 10 cities have populations of more than 100,000. The Stockholm metropolitan areas {{has a population of}} 2 million; Gothenburg has 906,000 in its metropolitan area and Malmö (including Lund) has 260,000, while the educational center of Uppsala has 130,000.

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Fedwire was taxed to its limit {{with the result}} that it was often subject to [...] "throttle," [...] which means that it took {{messages}} from the banks more slowly than its normal speed. From a user's point of view, throttle was like being put on hold every time one sent a message to the Fed. In 1983, the Fed made a major upgrade of the automated system it uses to support Fedwire. Because the major banks could not tolerate a long breakdown in their computer operations, the Fed designed its internal systems so that the maximum down time for a breakdown would be limited to a few minutes or a few hours at most. In an effort to improve operational efficiency even more, in the 1990s, the Reserve Banks consolidated most mainframe computer operations and centralized certain payment applications. More recently, the Reserve Banks have taken advantage of the flexibility and efficiency that Internet protocol (IP) and distributed processing technologies offer. These technologies have improved reliability and efficiency of Fedwire greatly. Today, three <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> <b>centers</b> support the Fedwire services. One site supports the primary processing environment with on-site backup. A second site serves an active, [...] "hot" [...] backup facility with on-site backup. A third site serves as a [...] "warm" [...] backup facility. The three <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> <b>centers</b> are located a considerable distance from one another (i.e., hundreds of miles) in order to mitigate the effects of natural disasters, power and telecommunication outages, and other wide scale, regional disruptions. In addition, all three <b>data</b> <b>processing</b> <b>centers</b> have appropriate security and include various contingency features, such as redundant power feeds, environmental and emergency control systems, dual computer and network operations centers, and dual customer service centers.|$|R
