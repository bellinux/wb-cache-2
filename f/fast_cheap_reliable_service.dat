The aim of this study was assessing a faster and reliable method of ESR estimation. Methods: An ESR estimation method was described and performed on 108 patients using capillary tube (micro ESR) and capillary peripheral blood. Micro ESR results at different intervals were measured and compared with Westergren ESR (conventional ESR) estimation by Pearson and Spearman’s coefficients. A regression equation was derived to predict conventional ESR values based on micro ESR results. The agreement of two measurements was demonstrated using the Bland-Altman plot. Results: Micro ESR results at 20 minutes showed the earliest close correlation with conventional ESR results at one hour (0. 99). The presented regression equation was able to closely predict ESR values (r 2 = 0. 974) and the Bland-Altman plot showed an acceptable agreement between converted and conventional ESR measurements.

Polymorphisms in NAT 1 (N-acetyl transferase) may be suitable markers to identify individuals at risk. Results A strategy allowing to address simultaneously 24 various genetic variants in the NAT 1 gene using the single sequencing reaction method on the same PCR product is described. A modified automated DNA sequencing using only one of the sequence terminators was used to genotype PCR products in single-track sequencing reactions of NAT 1 and was shown to be universal for both DNA sequencing using labeled primers and labeled nucleotides. By this method we detected known SNPs at site T 640 G, which confers the NAT 1 * 11 allele with frequency of 0. 036, further T 1088 A and C 1095 A with frequency of 0. 172 and 0. 188, respectively and a deletion of TAATAATAA in the poly A signal area with a frequency 0. 031. All observed frequencies were in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium and comparable to those in Caucasian population. The single-track signatures of the variant genotypes were verified on samples previously genotyped by RLFP. Conclusions The method could be of great help to scientists in the field of molecular epidemiology of screening of large populations for known informative biomarkers of susceptibility, such as NAT 1. </p...|$|R

This {{is the case for}} biosecurity, where <b>fast,</b> <b>cheap</b> and <b>reliable</b> simultaneous {{detection of}} proteotoxins and small toxins is needed. Two highly relevant proteotoxins, ricin (60 kDa) and bacterial toxin staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB, 30 kDa) and the small phycotoxin saxitoxin (STX, 0. 3 kDa) are potential biological warfare agents and require an analytical tool for simultaneous detection. Proteotoxins are successfully detected by sandwich immunoassays, whereas competitive immunoassays are more suitable for small toxins (< 1 kDa). Based on this need, this work provides a novel and efficient solution based on anti-idiotypic antibodies for small molecules to combine both assay principles on one microarray. The biotoxin measurements are performed on a flow-through chemiluminescence microarray platform MCR 3 in 18 minutes. The chemiluminescence signal was amplified by using a poly-horseradish peroxidase complex (polyHRP), resulting in low detection limits: 2. 9 ± 3. 1 μg L− 1 for ricin, 0. 1 ± 0. 1 μg L− 1 for SEB and 2. 3 ± 1. 7 μg L− 1 for STX.

The TM-PCR detects huPoV DNA in a linear range from 107 to 101 copies per assay. In reproducibility runs, the inter- and intra-assay variabilities were ≤ 60 and ≤ 50 %, respectively. The snPCR assay uses a set of four primers for the same region of the BK and JC viral genomes. In {{the first round of}} amplification, two general primers were used; in the second round, one of these general primers and two additional, BK- or JC-specific primers were used simultaneously to produce amplicons of different sizes specific for BK virus (246 bp) and JC virus (199 bp), respectively.

40|$|Plastic is a {{collective}} term describing {{a group of}} synthetic materials developed from the early 1900 s onward. The mass production of plastics began in the 1950 s and already in the 1970 s, the magnitude of plastic pollution has been recognized as an issue {{of concern for the}} global marine environment. Today, it is no longer a rare event to encounter plastic fragments and objects in modern coastal deposits. The presence of any form of plastic holds in itself a chronological indication (i. e. the deposit is younger than the invention of plastic). Larger items can be surveyed as discrete objects and allow the retrieval of more precise, though indirect age-information, such as production-date prints (i. e. the deposit is younger than the encountered litter item). The potential of this approach was tested in an investigation into the spatial distribution of stranded macroplastics in recent overwash deposits in SW Denmark. An amount of > 110 georeferenced surface samples containing date prints were surveyed in summer 2015. Objects with ages from the late 1970 s until 2014 were encountered. The distribution of the litter was clearly non-random in relation to overwash morphology, and based on the collected samples, it was possible to reconstruct indication on both the timing and the extent of extreme events since the 1990 s. These observations were cross-compared with a dense time series of satellite images and orthophotos. It is proposed that an improved interpretation of indications from the plastic record may be obtained by broader surveys including additional parameters, such as the exact location, elevation, chemical composition, assemblage, origin, product design, decay, fracturing or the colonization by marine sessile organisms, from all encountered macroplastic objects. If calibrated properly, the plastic assemblages may serve as <b>fast,</b> <b>cheap</b> and <b>reliable</b> chronological markers in recent coastal deposits...|$|R

Traditional methods use large amounts of solvent for the extraction, are time {{demanding}} and laborious, but new and more sophisticated methods have been developed in recent years. Among these new techniques, pressurised liquid extraction (PLE) is a good alternative to classical techniques. In this thesis a non-selective PLE method was developed for the extraction of PCBs from feed samples using the ASE 200 instrument. Using the larger ASE 300 instrument a method for selective extraction of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from fat containing food and feed samples was developed. In this selective PLE method, silica impregnated with concentrated H 2 SO 4 (40 %, w/w), was incorporated into the extraction cell. First the required fat/fat retainer ratio (FFR) was investigated for the 34 ml cells, as well as temperature, extraction solvents and flush volume. The larger cells (100 ml) were tested for extracting high fat containing samples and it was discovered that when using 100 ml cells the FFR only needed to be 0. 050 whereas in the 34 ml cells a FFR of 0. 025 was needed. The method using the 100 ml cells was successfully used for extracting polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and dioxin like PCBs from several food and feed matrices. A new shape selective extraction and clean-up procedure was additionally developed. By using special designed inserts, it was possible to incorporate a carbon column into the PLE cells and thereby eliminate the traditional carbon column fractionation.

In this work, we show that nanoscale patterned thin film samples support a new class of stable incomplete and complete skyrmions without need of external fields or anisotropy. We demonstrate hysteretic behaviour of a single skyrmion in disk and square shaped nanostructures, and show that the skyrmion core reverses via Bloch point occurrence and propagation. The ever increasing need for data storage creates great challenges for the development of high-capacity storage devices that are <b>cheap,</b> <b>fast,</b> <b>reliable,</b> and robust. Nowa-days, hard disk drive technology uses magnetic grains pointing up or down to encode binary data (0 or 1) in so-called perpendicular recording media. Current tech...|$|R
40|$|Online {{social media}} {{provides}} platform for social interactions. This platform produce large-scale data generated mostly from online conversations. Network analysis {{can help us}} to mine knowledge and pattern from the relationship between actors inside the network. This approach has been crucial in supporting prediction and decision-making process. In marketing context such as branding effort, using large-scale conversation data is <b>cheaper,</b> <b>faster</b> and <b>reliable</b> comparing mainstream approaches such as questionnaire and sampling. Social network analysis provides several metrics, which was built with no scalability in minds, thus it is computationally exhaustive. Some metrics such as centrality and community detections has exponential time and space complexity. With the availability of cheap but large-scale data, our challenge is how to measure social interactions based on those large-scale data. In this paper, we present our approach to reduce the computational complexity of social network analysis metrics based on graph compression method to solve real world brand awareness effort...|$|R
