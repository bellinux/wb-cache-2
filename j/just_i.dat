Steve Bould, Brian Marwood Adams, Smith each scored {{as the team}} {{came back from a}} goal behind to win. [...] "It was a performance of true quality which must have made excellent viewing," [...] was Graham's verdict and he described it as [...] "satisfying" [...] to beat Forest at their home ground. Arsenal were not at their fluent best against Newcastle United though came away from St James' Park with a cleansheet and a 1–0 win – Bould scored for the second successive match. Paul Merson scored twice against Middlesbrough as Arsenal recorded a 3–0 win and moved into second place, just two points behind Norwich City. Arsenal's five England internationals, who featured against Saudi Arabia a week before, were lauded in The Times for their performances, despite playing tamely for country. The match reporter suggested the club versus country dilemma could be solved by including more Arsenal players, something Graham was sceptical about when put to him. [...] "I want England to do very well. It's <b>just</b> <b>I</b> want Arsenal to do better," [...] he said. Arsenal's unbeaten run came to an end against Derby County, where at the Baseball Ground a debatable penalty was awarded to the home side which allowed them {{to get back into the}} game.|$|E

2500|$|Christians will {{sometimes}} {{point out that}} in their points of view, the wrongdoings of other Christians are not the fault of their religious scriptures but {{of those who have}} wrongly interpreted it. They posit that the mistakes of Christians do not refute the validity of their teachings, but merely proves their weakness and sinful nature, of which they then turn to Christ. Thus, according to them, the [...] "Word of God" [...] can still be true and valid without it having been accurately followed. According to Ron Sider, an Evangelical theologian, [...] "The tragedy is that poll after poll by Gallup and Barna show that evangelicals live just like the world. Contrast that with what the New Testament says about what happens when people come to living faith in Christ. There's supposed to be radical transformation {{in the power of the}} Holy Spirit (2 Cor 5:17, 1 Cor 10:13). The disconnect between our biblical beliefs and our practice is <b>just,</b> <b>I</b> think, heart-rending." ...|$|E

2500|$|Norfolk is {{the home}} county of Deaf Havana {{and many of the}} songs on Fools and Worthless Liars focus on the members childhoods' in the area. [...] "Hunstanton Pier" [...] is about the town of Hunstanton, where James Veck-Gilodi and bassist Lee Wilson went to school. 'It brings me back to the only place I ever really felt at home, and how much I miss it. It's hard for me to sing {{sometimes}} because it leads my mind to wander off and think about all the people I used to be so close to and what they are doing now'. [...] "Youth In Retrospect" [...] also deals with nostalgia and is again particularly personal to Veck-Gilodi and Lee Wilson. James has revealed that he is 'constantly battling with the fact that I'm constantly growing older' and how the pair 'wish we could go back to the days where... our biggest worry was whether our maths homework would be in on time'. [...] "Times Change, Friends Leave and Life Doesn't Stop For Anybody" [...] is about former member Ryan Mellor, with whom James has been friends since they were 14.

2500|$|The song title [...] "Yellow Ledbetter" [...] {{is derived}} from the actual name of an old friend of Vedder from Chicago, named Tim Ledbetter.

[...] On the official bootleg release of 5/3/03 - State College, Pennsylvania, Vedder sings [...] "I'd like to wish this war away, and I tried, but it just, just don't happen, don't happen that way/And my brother...they sent him off to fight for the flag. I <b>just,</b> <b>I</b> don't hope he comes home in a box or a bag", and [...] "And I know that he's just following his path. As long, as long as it's not a box or a bag." [...] On the official bootleg release of 7/11/03 - Mansfield, Massachusetts, Vedder sings in the first verse [...] "I think of him when I go to bed, and he's coming home in a box or a bag." [...] It's widely known that Vedder changes the lyrics of the song when singing it live, so it's difficult to know if what he's singing at the time are the original lyrics from 1991.|$|E
