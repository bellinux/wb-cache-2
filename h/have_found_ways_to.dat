25|$|Similar to Left 4 Dead {{and other}} Source Engine-based games, {{a number of}} players have {{constructed}} new maps, campaigns, and other variations for Left 4 Dead 2, supported by Valve through their software development kit for the game. With the kit, players <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> include the original Left 4 Dead campaigns into Left 4 Dead 2. Players have also found ways {{to increase the number}} of survivors up to 16, duplicating the graphics for the existing survivor characters as needed. In August 2010, Valve announced that it will promote selected community generated maps, one every two weeks, both by blog posts on their official site, and by offering the map on a number of their dedicated servers. Valve updated the game in January 2013 to include support for Steam Workshop, allowing users to create and share new scenarios, maps, clothing and weapons. and to create Mutation-like changes that can be applied to existing maps. A further patch in February 2013 introduced a new scripting system, Expanded Mutation System, that gives programmers more control and options to create new Mutations that can be played across any map or to customize behavior in specific campaigns; one such user-created Mutation creates an experience similar to the Zombie mode in , allowing players to buy weapons and barricades to fight off waves of zombies.|$|E

2500|$|The {{growth of}} media {{conglomerates}} in the U.S. since the 1980s {{has been accompanied}} by massive cuts in the budgets for investigative journalism. A 2002 study concluded [...] "that investigative journalism has all but disappeared from the nation's commercial airwaves". The empirical evidence for {{this is consistent with the}} conflicts of interest between the revenue sources for the media conglomerates and the mythology of an unbiased, dispassionate media: [...] advertisers have reduced their spending with media that reported too many unfavorable details.

2500|$|There {{have also}} been recent {{complaints}} that mobile spotters are a danger to others on the road. One potential danger posed by mobile spotters is distracted driving. Spotters can be distracted while monitoring radar while driving. Another cause for concern is that mobile spotters commonly park their vehicles on the shoulder {{for a short time}} while they observe, causing congestion along the roadway. In some areas, parking on the shoulder is only allowed in emergency situations, and it is also believed that spotters pose a distraction to others driving. Most spotter groups do support parking on the shoulder as long as it can be safely done and there is no other alternative. Many spotters <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> stay off the roadway altogether by parking in parking lots, driveways (when allowed), or field roads.|$|E
2500|$|While pacifism is the Buddhist ideal, Buddhist {{states and}} kingdoms have waged war {{throughout}} history and Buddhists <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> justify these conflicts. The 5th Dalai Lama who was installed {{as the head}} of Buddhism in Tibet by Gushri Khan after the Oirat invasion of Tibet (1635-1642), praised the acts of the Khan and said that he was an emanation of the great Bodhisattva Vajrapani. Buddhist warrior monks in feudal Japan sometimes committed organized acts of war, protecting their territories and attacking rival Buddhist sects. During the late Heian Period, the Tendai school was a particularly powerful sect, whose influential monasteries could wield armies of monks. A key text of this sect was the Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra, which contains passages allowing the use of violence for the defense of the Dharma. The Ashikaga period saw military conflict between the Tendai school, Jōdo Shinshū school and the Nichiren Buddhists. Zen Buddhism was influential among the samurai, and their Bushido code.|$|E
2500|$|Research geared towards life {{extension}} strategies in various organisms is currently {{under way at}} a number of academic and private institutions. Since 2009, investigators <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> increase the lifespan of nematode worms and yeast by 10-fold; the record in nematodes was achieved through genetic engineering and the extension in yeast by a combination of genetic engineering and caloric restriction. A 2009 review of longevity research noted: [...] "Extrapolation from worms to mammals is risky at best, and it cannot be assumed that interventions will result in comparable {{life extension}} factors. Longevity gains from dietary restriction, or from mutations studied previously, yield smaller benefits to Drosophila than to nematodes, and smaller still to mammals. This is not unexpected, since mammals have evolved to live many times the worm's lifespan, and humans live nearly twice as long as the next longest-lived primate. From an evolutionary perspective, mammals and their ancestors have already undergone several hundred million years of natural selection favoring traits that could directly or indirectly favor increased longevity, and may thus have already settled on gene sequences that promote lifespan. Moreover, the very notion of a [...] "life-extension factor" [...] that could apply across taxa presumes a linear response rarely seen in biology." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Malaysia, the {{displaying}} {{of cigarette}} packets in advertisements {{with a general}} warning on long-time smoking that came into effect in June 1976 has been banned since 1995. However, this has not stopped tobacco companies from advertising their products. There are also restrictions on tobacco advertising after the ban of displaying of cigarette packaging, print media advertising is restricted to only one page and advertising on television should not be more than 15 seconds. They <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> continue to build their brands by using brand names for a bistro and cybercafes such as Benson & Hedges Bistro and Sampoerna A International Cyberworld, for stationery, accessories, clothing like Dunhill, Marlboro Classics, Davidoff, Perilly's, Pall Mall, John Player Specials, Winfield and Winston. Tobacco companies also sponsor holiday tours like Mild Seven Seafarers Club, Peter Stuyvesant Travel and Tours, Kent Holidays and Salem Holidays as well as concerts and entertainment events. All of these are indirect advertising strategies employed by tobacco companies. Tobacco advertising continued without the display of cigarette packaging until January 2003, when the Malaysian federal government banned even such indirect advertising of tobacco brands, except in certain establishments licensed to sell tobacco products. Formula One Grand Prix and other sporting events are still allowed to use tobacco sponsorship. In 2009, Malaysian government halted the branding of cigarettes as [...] "light" [...] or [...] "mild" [...] on all smoking packages and has decided to place graphic images on the cigarette packs to show the adverse long-term effects of excessive smoking.|$|E
