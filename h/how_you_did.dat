His oldest brother, Greg, was 14 years Hoffman's senior and a mentor to his two younger brothers. [...] After Hoffman's first Little League game, Greg {{asked him how he}} did. Hoffman responded, [...] "I went 2-for-4, double, RBI." [...] to which Greg replied, [...] "That'll be the last (blanking) time you tell me <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> When I ask you <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> it's how the team did."

[...] " [...] was the guide while Greg was the drill instructor", said Hoffman.|$|E

2500|$|Kierkegaard came to {{hope that}} no one would retain their sins even though they have been forgiven. And by the same token that no one who truly {{believed}} in the forgiveness of sin would live their own life as an objection against the existence of forgiveness. He made the point that Cato committed suicide before Caesar had a chance to forgive him. This fear of not finding forgiveness is devastating. Edna H. Hong quoted Kierkegaard in her 1984 book, Forgiveness is a Work As Well As a Grace and Kierkegaard wrote about forgiveness in 1847. [...] In 1954, Samuel Barber set to music Kierkegaard's prayer, [...] "Father in Heaven! Hold not our sins up against us but hold us up against our sins so that the thought of You when it wakens in our soul, and each time it wakens, should not remind us of what we have committed but of what You did forgive, not of how we went astray but of <b>how</b> <b>You</b> <b>did</b> save us!" ...|$|E
