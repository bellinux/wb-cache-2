5|$|Peckham {{also studied}} other fields, however; and {{was guided by}} Robert Grosseteste and Roger Bacon's views {{on the value of}} {{experimental}} science. Where Peckham met Bacon is not known, {{but it would have been}} at either Paris or Oxford. Bacon's <b>influence</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen in Peckham's works on optics (the Perspectiva communis) and astronomy.|$|E
5|$|Although The Raft of the Medusa retains {{elements}} of the traditions of history painting, in both its choice of subject matter and its dramatic presentation, it represents {{a break from the}} calm and order of the prevailing Neoclassical school. Géricault's work attracted wide attention from its first showing and was then exhibited in London. The Louvre acquired it soon after the artist's death at the age of 32. The painting's <b>influence</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen in the works of Eugène Delacroix, J. M. W. Turner, Gustave Courbet, and Édouard Manet.|$|E
5|$|Several {{stations}} were rebuilt in a Modernist style influenced or designed by Charles Holden, who {{was inspired by}} examples of Modernist architecture in mainland Europe. This <b>influence</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen in the bold vertical and horizontal forms, which were combined {{with the use of}} traditional materials like brick. Holden called them 'brick boxes with concrete lids'. Today, several of these Holden-designed stations are listed buildings, including the prototype Sudbury Town listed as Grade II*.|$|E

50|$|The {{music of}} Peru is an {{amalgamation}} of sounds and styles drawing on Peru's Andean, Spanish, and African roots. Andean <b>influences</b> <b>can</b> perhaps <b>be</b> best heard in wind instruments {{and the shape}} of the melodies, while the African <b>influences</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> heard in the rhythm and percussion instruments, and European <b>influences</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> heard in the harmonies and stringed instruments. Pre-Columbian Andean music was played on drums and wind instruments, not unlike the European pipe and tabor tradition. Andean tritonic and pentatonic scales were elaborated during the colonial period into hexatonic, and in some cases, diatonic scales.|$|R
5|$|While not {{initially}} a success with North American audiences, Blade Runner was popular internationally and garnered a cult following. The film's dark style and futuristic designs {{have served as}} a benchmark and its <b>influence</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen in many subsequent science fiction films, video games, anime, and television programs. For example, Ronald D. Moore and David Eick, the producers of the re-imagining of Battlestar Galactica, have both cited Blade Runner as one of the major influences for the show.|$|E
5|$|By 1909, it {{had spread}} to the Orange River Colony. In South Africa, as at Azusa Street, the {{movement}} was initially multi-racial, appealing to both Boers and blacks. It expanded rapidly among African farm workers in the Orange River Colony and Wakkerstroom, where Pentecostal beliefs in divine healing through prayer {{would have made it}} an attractive alternative to traditional or medical treatment. Lake made contact with the Wakkerstroom Zionists led by Pieter Louis Le Roux, and many Zionists joined the Apostolic Faith Mission. Their <b>influence</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen in the AFM's practice of baptism by triple immersion, once each {{in the name of the}} Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. There was also interaction with other churches, such as the Plymouth Brethren and International Holiness movement, which often resulted in individuals or whole congregations joining the AFM. Most AFM converts, however, came from the Dutch Reformed churches.|$|E
5|$|Result {{from the}} {{expansion}} of the British Empire, British cultural <b>influence</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> observed in the language and culture of a geographically wide assortment of countries such as Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, the United States, and the British overseas territories. These states are sometimes collectively known as the Anglosphere. As well as the British influence on its empire, the empire also influenced British culture, particularly British cuisine. Innovations and movements within the wider-culture of Europe have also changed the United Kingdom; Humanism, Protestantism, and representative democracy have developed from broader Western culture.|$|E

5|$|The Malay Archipelago {{influenced}} many works {{starting with}} those of Wallace's contemporaries. The novelist Joseph Conrad used it as source material for some of his novels, including Almayer's Folly, An Outcast of the Islands, and The Rescue. Commentators have suggested it had a particularly profound influence on Lord Jim, crediting it with among other things {{the inspiration for the}} character Stein the entomologist. Conrad's assistant Richard Curle wrote that The Malay Archipelago was Conrad's favourite bedside book; Conrad refers directly to what he calls Alfred Wallace's famous book on the Malay Archipelago in The Secret Agent. In his short story, Neil MacAdam, W. Somerset Maugham has the title character read The Malay Archipelago while travelling to Borneo, and its <b>influence</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> felt in the story's description of that island.|$|E
5|$|The {{writing of}} Roa Bastos spans four countries, six decades, and countless genres. In his {{lifetime}} he made important contributions to Latin American Boom writing, to the related Dictator Novel, {{and to the}} Nuevo Cine film movement through screenplays like Alias Gardelito (1961). Roa Bastos' <b>influence</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found {{in the works of}} many foreign post-boom writers, including Mempo Giardinelli, Isabel Allende, Eraclio Zepeda, Antonio Skármeta, Saul Ibargoyen, and Luisa Valenzuela. The most important author to come out of Paraguay, he also remains highly influential {{for a new generation of}} Paraguayan authors. Roa Bastos' relationship with his country, unbroken by over 40 years of exile, was considered so important that in 1989 he was invited back by Paraguay's new president, Andrés Rodríguez, following the collapse of the Stroessner regime.|$|E
5|$|Meyerbeer had no pupils and {{no direct}} 'school'. Yet as his works spanned , clear traces of his <b>influence</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{found in the}} grand operas of Fromental Halévy, Gaetano Donizetti, Giuseppe Verdi and others. After 1850, Huebner notes a {{continuing}} tradition of operas at Paris where 'principals appear with chorus {{at the end of}} an act and where private intrigue conjoins a well-articulated public dimension in the plot' and cites amongst others Charles Gounod's La nonne sanglante (1854), Ambroise Thomas's Hamlet and operas by Jules Massenet, amongst them Le roi de Lahore (1877) and Le Cid (1885). The line of succession was however virtually washed away in the tide of Wagner in Paris after 1890 (see below). The influence of Meyerbeer has also been detected in the operas of Antonín Dvořák and other Czech composers, and in the operas of Russian composers including Rimsky-Korsakov and the young Tchaikovsky, who thought Les Huguenots 'one of the greatest works in the repertoire'.|$|E

5|$|Delhi's {{culture has}} been {{influenced}} by its lengthy history and historic association as the capital of India, Although a strong Punjabi <b>Influence</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen in language, Dress and Cuisine brought by {{the large number of}} refugees who came following the partition in 1947 the recent migration from other parts of India has made it a melting pot. This is exemplified by many significant monuments in the city. Delhi is also identified as the location of Indraprastha, the ancient capital of the Pandavas. The Archaeological Survey of India recognises 1200 heritage buildings and 175 monuments as national heritage sites. In the Old City, the Mughals and the Turkic rulers constructed several architecturally significant buildings, such as the Jama MasjidIndia's largest mosque built in 1656 and the Red Fort. Three World Heritage Sitesthe Red Fort, Qutab Minar and Humayun's Tombare located in Delhi. Other monuments include the India Gate, the Jantar Mantaran 18th-century astronomical observatoryand the Purana Qilaa 16th-century fortress. The Laxminarayan temple, Akshardham temple,Bangla Sahib the Bahá'í Lotus temple and the ISKCON temple are examples of modern architecture. Raj Ghat and associated memorials houses memorials of Mahatma Gandhi and other notable personalities. New Delhi houses several government buildings and official residences reminiscent of British colonial architecture, including the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the Secretariat, Rajpath, the Parliament of India and Vijay Chowk. Safdarjung's Tomb {{is an example of the}} Mughal gardens style. Some regal havelis (palatial residences) are in the Old City.|$|E

25|$|The {{ultimate}} {{manifestation of}} this cultural <b>influence</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{observed in the}} present dominant position of Malay language and its variants in Maritime Southeast Asia, the establishment of ethnic Malays realm within the region, the forming of new cultures such as the Peranakan, {{and the development of}} many Malay trade and creole languages.|$|E
25|$|Although {{embalming}} {{was unusual}} and regarded as mainly an Egyptian practice, it is mentioned in Latin literature, {{with a few}} instances documented by archaeology in Rome and throughout the Empire where no Egyptian <b>influence</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> assumed.
