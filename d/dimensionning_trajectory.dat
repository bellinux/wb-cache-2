40|$|Abstract. The {{domain of}} spatiotemporal {{applications}} is {{a treasure trove}} of new types of data as well as queries. For designing and testing novel data types and access methods that will support these applications, large spatiotemporal datasets are needed. As in many cases {{it is not possible to}} obtain real datasets, either they do not exist or they are not accessible, synthetic datasets are governed by artificial parameters rather than by the (sometimes invisible) rules governing real-world behavior. In this work we show how, at least for some cases, one can generate spatiotemporal datasets that simulate real-world behavior. We illustrate example cases and translate them into appropriate calls of GSTD, a spatiotemporal data generator.

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} method of {{classifying}} stochastic, non-stationary, self-similar signals which originate from non-linear systems and may be comprised of multiple signals, using a multifractal analysis and neural networks. The first stage of the signal classification process entails the extraction {{of the most important}} features of the signal. To perform this feature extraction, the signal is first transformed into the fractal dimension domain by calculating its variance fractal <b>dimension</b> <b>trajectory</b> (VFDT). This transformation emphasizes the underlying multifractal characteristics of the signal, and more importantly for classification, it produces a normalized signal. The resulting VFDT can be used directly for classification. Alternatively, the most important features of the VFDT can be obtained through the use of Kohonen self-organizing feature maps (SOFMs) and the classification can then be based upon these features. Configurations with and without the SOFMs are examined in this thesis. The second stage of the classification process involves the use of neural networks to determine the particular class of a signal based on its extracted features.

40|$|Abstract- In this paper, {{fast and}} {{reliable}} identification of radio transmitters {{based on an}} analysis of their turn-on transients is presented. Since the transients are unique, they are called the fingerprints of the corresponding radio transmitters. Major tasks in a radio transmitter identification system are: (i) separating a transient from the channel noise, (ii) extracting important features contained in the transient, and (iii) classifying the transient based on these features. We have developed a system capable of segmenting noise efficiently, using the variance fractal <b>dimension</b> <b>trajectory</b> [Kins 94] [Shaw 97], with a modified triggering technique which improves the segmentation consistency. A variance fractal amplification technique [Kins 94] is used for feature extraction and enhancement. Multifractal modelling of transients based on their strange attractors is also discussed in this paper to investigate the suitability of such compact representations in transient classification [SuKS 99 a] [SuKS 99 b]. This is motivated by the observation that a transient signal contaminated by noise {{can be considered as}} an output from a chaotic dynamical system. The probabilistic neural network (PNN) is used in the classification stage. Preprocessing of the PNN using the principal component analysis (PCA) and the self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is performed to reduce the dimensionality of the PN...|$|R

Furthermore, a limit theorem for the dynamics of the center of mass of the soliton in the weak-coupling and spaceadiabatic limit is proven in two and higher dimensions: Under certain mixing hypotheses for the potential, the momentum of the center of mass of the soliton converges in law to a diffusion process on a sphere of constant momentum.
