With increasing applied hydraulic pressure, it is found that the foams have very small buoyancy losses at low pressures but beyond a threshold pressure, buoyancy losses increase rapidly. The threshold pressures of the foams increase with decrease in cell window area. A cell window is the lamella of the foam material that separates two adjacent cells. The cell sizes of the foam are found to correlate with the size of the air bubbles entrained during initial mixing. Surfactants, which reduce the surface tension of the polyol to the greatest extent, are found to give the finest initial bubbles, smaller cells, and foams with the highest hydraulic resistance.

40|$|The wave transmission, {{reflection}} and energy dissipation characteristics of partially submerged 'T'-type breakwaters (Fig. 1) were studied using physical models. Regular and random waves, with wide ranges of wave heights and periods and a constant water depth were used. Five different <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>immersions</b> <b>of</b> the 'T'-type breakwater were selected.

It is found that the coefficient of transmission generally reduces with increased wave steepness and increased relative water depth, d/L.

40|$|The task of {{the work}} {{presented}} here was to develop an inner diameter laser cladding head for internal cladding of barrels with a length up to 1800 mm and an internal diameter of 58 mm. The small dimensions were a big challenge for the cladding process and especially for the cladding head. So {{it was necessary to}} develop a new slim process head to reach the small and long internal <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>immersions.</b> The new optic design of the MINIID includes many advantages of the former established IWS ID cladding head COAXID and further special features. The big challenge was to integrate all media supply like powder, water cooling, and inert gas as well as to include all optic components like optical fiber cable, lenses, mirror and finally a process control camera plus a thermocouple element. On the basis <b>of</b> the high <b>immersion</b> <b>depth</b> and the small diameter it was really necessary to integrate a process and temperature monitoring system. The new design of the head has enabled us to clad barrels with a minimum diameter of 50 mm.

Organic-rich deep-sea falls may {{play a major role in}} the dispersal and evolution of chemoautotrophic communities at the ocean floor, and chemosynthetic symbiotic, free-living, and attached microorganisms may drive the primary production at these communities. However, little is known about the microbiota thriving in and around organic falls. Our aim was to investigate and compare free-living and attached communities of bacteria and archaea from artificially immersed and naturally sunken wood logs with varying characteristics at several sites in the deep sea and in shallow water to address basic questions on the microbial ecology of sunken wood. Multivariate indirect ordination analyses of capillary electrophoresis single-stranded conformation polymorphisms (CE-SSCP) fingerprinting profiles demonstrated high similarity of bacterial and archaeal assemblages present in timbers and logs situated at geographically distant sites and at different <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>immersion.</b> This similarity implies that wood falls harbor a specialized microbiota as observed in other ecosystems when the same environmental conditions reoccur. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy observations combined with multivariate direct gradient analysis of Bacteria CE-SSCP profiles demonstrate that type of wood (hard vs. softwood), and time <b>of</b> <b>immersion</b> are important in structuring sunken wood bacterial communities. Archaeal populations were present only in samples with substantial signs of decay, which were also more similar in their bacterial assemblages, providing indirect evidence of temporal succession in the microbial communities that develop in and around wood falls...|$|R

The PPy films exhibit an overhang structure due to <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> particle <b>immersion</b> in the water phase. As a result of the overhang structure, the PPy films are made hydrophobic, although the material itself is hydrophilic.

40|$|Different {{types of}} breakwaters have been {{developed}} {{in the past for}} the protection of valuable coastal property, commercial activity and beach morphology. Among these, gravity-type breakwaters are the most common and provide good surface wave attenuation. However, these breakwaters are not always suitable due to their adverse impact on the coastal environment. To alleviate the problem, free surface breakwaters with a variety of caisson designs have been proposed and developed. The main advantages of such breakwaters are low capital cost, freedom from silting and scouring, short construction period, circulation of water beneath the breakwater and exertion of relatively low hydrodynamic forces on the structure as compared to conventional breakwaters. However, complete tranquillity on the lee side is not likely to occur due to wave energy transfer through the permeable parts of the breakwater. The degree of wave attenuation primarily depends on the configuration of the breakwater, the water depth and the incident wave conditions. The hydrodynamic performance of such free surface breakwaters {{is the subject of this}} thesis. Semicircular breakwaters mounted on a low-crested rubble mound structure were successfully built for harbour protection in Japan and China. However, the concept of having semicircular structures as free surface breakwaters has not yet been explored by the research community. As a result, this research is initiated with the aim of developing a free surface semicircular breakwater (SCB) that would serve as an anti-reflection barrier and provide reasonably good wave protection to coastal and marine infrastructures. To meet this research goal, a free surface SCB models were constructed and tested in a wave flume under various wave conditions. The experiments were conducted in three stages. For the first stage, the SCB model was initially tested without any perforations on the curved surface (i. e. a solid SCB) for different <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>immersion</b> from the still water level in the wave flume.

40|$|A {{theory is}} {{presented}} which describes the mechanisms involved in concrete pressures on formwork in wide sections. The main {{value of the}} theory is in providing a framework for analysing site data and indicating areas in which potential economies in design might be made. The horizontal pressure of concrete on formwork comprises two components whose magnitude depends -on {{the proportion of the}} vertical load taken by the particle structure and the pore water pressure. In normal formwork, the pore water pressure provides the major contribution to the maximum horizontal pressure and therefore any factor which increases the rate of load transfer from the pore water pressure onto the particle structure, will decrease the maximum pressure. For example, porous formwork will give lower horizontal pressures than impermeable formwork and the re-analysis of existing site data supports this prediction. Normal internal vibration does not have such a significant' affect on the maximum horizontal pressure as previously reported, but it can fluidify concrete to the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> poker <b>immersion.</b> The elements <b>of</b> the theory are supported by an experimental programme, re-analysis of existing site data and new site measurements.
