40|$|It {{is hardly}} {{clear from the}} {{literature}} how the development of students’ innovative projects <b>in</b> higher <b>music</b> <b>education</b> can be facilitated. We have plenty of suggestions from schools, {{but what about the}} nature of the interaction between lecturers and adult students as an innovative project <b>in</b> higher <b>music</b> <b>education</b> unfolds? How can these interactions facilitate the development of the students’ independent thinking? And what is the influence of the lecturers’ approach to the facilitation of creative development <b>in</b> higher <b>music</b> <b>education?</b> This book chapter explores these matters by: (i) reviewing some literature on this topic, including what is meant by innovation-driven projects; and then (ii) profiling an example from a student-led innovative project with undergraduate conservatory students focussed on the use of drama to reduce performance anxiety. Based on the links between the literature and this case, in the conclusion I suggest ten building blocks to facilitate the development of students’ innovative projects <b>in</b> higher <b>music</b> <b>education</b> while preserving the independent thinking of the students...|$|R

25|$|After his death, Bach's {{reputation}} as a composer at first declined: his work was regarded as old-fashioned compared to the emerging galant style.

The bulk of the music that had been printed during the composer's lifetime, at least the part that was remembered, was for the organ and the harpsichord. Thus, his {{reputation as}} a composer was initially mostly limited to his keyboard music, and that even fairly limited to its value <b>in</b> <b>music</b> <b>education.</b>|$|E
