The program was further delayed when one of the five test aircraft suffered serious damage during a landing attempt at Renton Municipal Airport, site of the company's Renton factory. On December 13, 1969 a test aircraft was being taken to have test equipment removed and a cabin installed when pilot Ralph C. Cokely undershot the airport's short runway. The 747's right, outer landing gear was torn off and two engine nacelles were damaged. However, these difficulties did not prevent Boeing from taking a test aircraft to the 28th Paris Air Show in mid-1969, where it was displayed to the public for the first time. The 747 received its FAA airworthiness certificate in December 1969, clearing it for introduction into service.|$|E

50|$|At {{start the}} {{ignition}} point is 10° BTDC. To facilitate start when coolant temperature is below 0°C the ECU will ground each trigger line 210 times/second between 10° BTDC and 20° ATDC, at which a “multi spark” will appear. The function is active up to an engine speed of 900 RPM. At idle a special ignition matrix is utilised. Normal ignition point is 6°-8° BTDC. If the <b>engine</b> <b>stalls</b> e.g. cooling fan activation the ignition point is advanced up to 20 ° BTDC {{in order to increase}} the engines torque to restore the idle RPM. In the same way the ignition is retarded if the engines RPM is increased. When the TPS senses an increase in throttle opening the ECU leaves the idle ignition timing map and regulates the ignition timing in respect of load and engine speed.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discloses}} {{opportunities of}} how information recorded by on-board recorders of flight parameters {{can be used}} for investigation of avionic events. An example of the methodical approach is presented of how to verify data acquired from flight recorders, which unambiguously indicates the feasibility of further investigation and analyses of avionic events that may happen to aircrafts. Subsequently the effect of the <b>engine</b> <b>stall</b> is outlined, which enables analysis of those avionic events when the effect of <b>engine(s)</b> <b>stall</b> took place. The paper discloses two cases of avionic events when <b>engine</b> <b>stall</b> was the underlying reason of problems, i. e. when a helicopter entered a stream of exhaust gases produced by a missile launched by that helicopter and when icing of the intake channel occurred in a turbojet engine installed on a helicopter. Investigations of that type are indispensable due to operation constraints and technical conditions of aircrafts operations, where meeting these conditions is the principal requirements in terms of flight safety. This study confirms that opportunities to use data from on-board recorders of flight parameters {{to find out what was}} going on with the aircrafts during avionic events are considerable...|$|R

50|$|The {{national}} park's superintendent, Cad Spinner, selfishly diverts all {{the water}} supply to his lodge's roof sprinklers to prevent the lodge from burning, and so prevents the firefighters from making fire retardant for their own duties. With only their pre-existing tank loads, the firefighters manage to help the evacuees escape the fire while Dusty is alerted that two elderly campers named Harvey and Winnie, that he met earlier, are trapped on a burning bridge deep in the fire zone. He races to the scene and is forced to push his engine to the maximum to climb vertically up a waterfall to refill his water tanks to drop water to save the campers, as the only other surface water near is a river too shallow and twisty and rocky for him to scoop from. Meanwhile, Blade shows up and assists Harvey and Winnie by holding up the bridge. Dusty successfully drops water and extinguishes the fire, allowing the campers to escape just before the bridge collapses, but his overstressed gearbox fails completely and his <b>engine</b> <b>stalls.</b> He tries to glide through the trees to make a safe landing, {{but one of his}} pontoons hits one of the trees and he crashes.|$|E
5000|$|In 1974, Rokon {{produced}} the RT340 TCR Automatic, using a snowmobile-type Salsbury CVT, {{rear wheel drive}} only, and dual disc brakes. Another unusual feature was a pull cord to start the engine. The transmission freewheels with the engine at idle; starts to engage about 2800 RPM; and is tuned so the engine always runs near peak power, at 6,000 to 6,700 RPM. The lowest gear ratio is 3.76:1 and highest 0.87:1. Using a CVT allows a use of a 2-stroke cycle motor with higher power but narrow power band. The engine sound is unusual as the engine stays at a nearly fixed speed and the transmission ratio changes according to speed. The transmission freewheels when not driving forward, {{so there is no}} engine braking. The transmission is vented to the outside for cooling, and so is contaminated by stream crossings and other environmental exposure. Water causes slipping but quickly goes away; however grit can cause transmission sticking. Riding on loose surfaces is sometimes complicated, as rear wheel breakaway does not cause telltale changes in the engine sound. However, most other riding is intuitive and sometimes much more convenient as the automatic avoids <b>engine</b> <b>stalls</b> and other problems with gear selection. Operation is loud (90.3 dB(A)) as the engine is always running fast except at idle. Despite low front wheel weight, about 43%, it had trouble pulling wheelies, a problem for Enduro riding. Prototypes were raced by factory riders from 1971 to 1973 under Tom Clark; [...] "TCR" [...] stands for [...] "Tom Clark Replica". In the 48th annual six-days trial, all four riders earned bronze medals for finishing. [...] "Cycle Guide" [...] test riders reported it superior for hill climbing and fast on hard surfaces, but poor on loose surfaces and descending hills.|$|E

40|$|Model Predictive Control (MPC) can enable {{powertrain}} {{systems to}} satisfy more stringent vehicle requirements.

In this chapter, we first obtain a control-oriented model where ancillary states are added to account for delay and performance specifications. Then the MPC optimization problem is defined. The MPC feedback law is synthesized as a piecewise affine function, suitable for implementation in automotive microcontrollers. The obtained design has been extensively tested in a vehicle under different operating conditions. Finally, we show how competing requirements can be met by a switched MPC controller...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} of flow instabilities in the inlet ducts of a two-engine vertical takeoff and landing aircraft DP- 1 C {{is described in}} this report. Recent tests revealed that the engines stall during run ups while the aircraft is operating on the ground. These pop stalls occurred at relatively low power levels, sometimes as low as 60 percent of the engine full speed. Inability to run the engines up to the full speed level is attributed to in-ground effects associated with hot gas ingestion. Such pop stalls were never experienced when the aircraft was tested on a elevated grid platform, which ensured that the aircraft was operating in out-of-the-ground-effect conditions. Based on available information on problems experienced with other vertical takeoff and landing aircraft designs, {{it was assumed that}} the <b>engine</b> <b>stalls</b> were caused by partial ingestion of hot gases streaming forward from the main exit nozzle under the aircraft inlets, which are very close to the ground. It was also suggested that the nose wheel undercarriage, located between the inlets, may generate vortices or an unstable wake causing intense mixing of hot exit gases with incoming inlet flow, which would enhance the hot gas ingestion. After running a short three-day series of tests with fully instrumented engine inlets, it is now believed the most probable reason for engine pop stalls are random ingestions of a vortex generated between the two streams moving in opposite directions: outbound hot gas stream from the main nozzle close to the ground and inbound inlet flow above. Originally, the vortex is in a horizontal plane. However, at a certain velocity ratio of these two streams, the vortex attaches either to the ground or the aircraft surface at one end and the other end is swallowed by one of the aircraft inlets. Once the vortex enters the inlet duct, a puff of hot air can be sucked through the vortex core into the engine, which causes a serious inlet flow field distortion followed by an engine stall. Once the <b>engine</b> <b>stalls,</b> the outflow from the inlet pushes the vortex away and the engine resumes normal operation. This hypothesis needs to be verified experimentally; e. g., by extensive smoke flow visualization ahead of the aircraft inlets...|$|E
40|$|Idle {{speed control}} is a {{landmark}} application of feedback control in automotive vehicles that continues to be of significant interest to automotive industry practitioners, since improved idle performance and robustness translate into better fuel economy, emissions and drivability. In this paper, we develop a model predictive control (MPC) strategy for regulating the engine speed to the idle speed set-point by actuating the electronic throttle and the spark timing. The MPC controller coordinates the two actuators according to a specified cost function, while explicitly taking into account constraints on the control and requirements on the acceptable engine speed range, e. g., to avoid <b>engine</b> <b>stalls.</b> Following a process proposed here {{for the implementation of}} MPC in automotive applications, an MPC controller is obtained with excellent performance and robustness as demonstrated in actual vehicle tests. In particular, the MPC controller performs better than an existing baseline controller in the vehicle, is robust to changes in operating conditions, and to different types of disturbances. It is also shown that the MPC computational complexity is well within the capability of production electronic control unit and that the improved performance achieved by the MPC controller can translate into fuel economy improvements...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes an {{adaptive}} controller for a hypersonic cruise vehicle subject to aerodynamic uncertainties, center-of-gravity movements, actuator saturation, failures, and time-delays. The adaptive control architecture {{is based on}} a linearized model of the underlying rigid body dynamics and explicitly accommodates for all uncertainties. It also includes a baseline proportional integral filter commonly used in optimal control designs. The control design is validated using a high-fidelity HSV model that incorporates various effects including coupling between structural modes and aerodynamics, and thrust pitch coupling. An elaborate comparative analysis of the proposed Adaptive Robust Controller for Hypersonic Vehicles (ARCH) is carried out using a control verification methodology. In particular, we study the resilience of the controller to the uncertainties mentioned above for a set of closed-loop requirements that prevent excessive structural loading, poor tracking performance and <b>engine</b> <b>stalls.</b> This analysis enables the quantification of the improvements that result from using and adaptive controller for a typical maneuver in the V - h space under cruise conditions.
