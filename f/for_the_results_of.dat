500|$|Many {{different}} kinds of analysis are performed on ice cores, including visual layer counting, tests for electrical conductivity and physical properties, and assays for inclusion of gases, particles, radionuclides, and various molecular species. [...] <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> these tests to be useful in the reconstruction of palaeoenvironments, {{there has to be}} a way to determine the relationship between depth and age of the ice. [...] The simplest approach is to count layers of ice that correspond to the original annual layers of snow, but this is not always possible. [...] An alternative is to model the ice accumulation and flow to predict how long it takes a given snowfall to reach a particular depth. [...] Another method is to correlate radionuclides or trace atmospheric gases with other timescales such as periodicities in the earth's orbital parameters.|$|E

500|$|As First Lady, Imelda Marcos {{was summoned}} {{more than once}} from the Palace in order to {{campaign}} for her husband and Nacionalista candidates 1985 presidential elections and during the 1967 senatorial and local elections as its results were of importance <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> the succeeding 1969 presidential election. This was based on {{what had happened to}} former President Diosdado Macapagal wherein the defeat of his Senate candidates had presaged his own fall on the following election. Marcos concentrated his efforts in Cebu which indicated that he felt that his most serious rival would be Senator Sergio Osmeña, Jr. Marcos used the First Lady as his special ace and made her campaign in Cebu using her glamor and charm among the Cebuanos. In the 1985 & 1969 presidential elections, Ferdinand even called Imelda Marcos as his [...] "secret weapon." [...] Through the combined efforts of the President and First Lady, they were able to repudiate the leadership of Osmena in his own province. All eight Senatorial candidates of the Nacionalista party in Cebu won and 47 out of 49 Cebu towns were captured by the Marcos-led Nacionalistas.|$|E

Mosley also commented on the weight issue surrounding Schumacher saying that [...] "it is a pity that it became a matter for public discussion, whether he drank a huge amount of water, didn't go to the loo or had a heavy helmet. It is just a pity he didn't take care that it didn't happen". Elf was also unhappy with {{the way in which the}} episode had been handled, the company's Commercial Director Michel Bonnet declaring that [...] "We believe the FIA acted in a high-handed manner in disqualifying our two cars so quickly. It should have declared the results provisional and waited <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> further analysis. Acting the way it did, the FIA has affected the image of large industrial companies, of top F1 teams and of famous drivers. The fact that we have been treated as cheats by a red team – probably red with embarrassment at having finished one lap behind our cars – and by Gerhard Berger is a serious slur against us." [...] Elf also threatened to take the matter to a tribunal if the cars were not reinstated. Company representative Valerie Jorquera also highlighted the need for a consistent chromatographic analysis of fuel samples, drawing attention to the fact that the samples provided during the event had been analysed by a different company than the reference sample, and that the differences may have been caused by the use of different analytical machines and methods. The incident was seen as unfortunate for the sport, which was trying to make a fresh start after several controversies the previous year. From the San Marino Grand Prix onwards, an FIA mobile fuel laboratory accompanied the teams to each event to permit more detailed testing at the track, in addition to ensuring consistency between events.|$|E
