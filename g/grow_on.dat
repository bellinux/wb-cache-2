5|$|Despite their {{apparent}} simplicity, {{bacteria can}} form complex associations with other organisms. These symbiotic associations {{can be divided}} into parasitism, mutualism and commensalism. Due to their small size, commensal bacteria are ubiquitous and <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> animals and plants exactly as they will <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> any other surface. However, their growth can be increased by warmth and sweat, and large populations of these organisms in humans are the cause of body odour.|$|E
5|$|Galerina marginata is a {{saprobic}} fungus, obtaining nutrients {{by breaking}} down organic matter. It {{is known to}} have most of the major classes of secreted enzymes that dissolve plant cell wall polysaccharides, and {{has been used as a}} model saprobe in recent studies of ectomycorrhizal fungi. Because of its variety of enzymes capable of breaking down wood and other lignocellulosic materials, the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) is currently sequencing its genome. The fungus is typically reported to <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> or near the wood of conifers, although it has been observed to <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> hardwoods as well. Fruit bodies may grow solitarily, but more typically in groups or small clusters, and appear in the summer to autumn. Sometimes, they may <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> buried wood and thus appear to be growing on soil.|$|E
5|$|Over 340species {{of plants}} <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> the rocks, {{including}} approximately 200species of wildflowers. Some {{of the most}} common wildflowers are western buttercups, desert parsley, bicolor lupine, and California goldfields. Camas and death camas also <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> the rocks. Camas produces an edible bulb, while death camas is poisonous and was used by the Takelma as an anesthetic.|$|E

5|$|The corticioid {{species of}} Boidinia, Gloeopeniophorella, and Pseudoxenasma develop crust-like fruitbodies with a smooth, porous, or flaky surface and <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> tree logs or dead branches.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} H.eburneus <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> the soil, mostly in {{coniferous}} woods, thickets and grassy areas. The fungus prefers soil that is moist, mesic, loamy and calcareous.|$|E
5000|$|This range closely matches {{that of its}} relative, Haworthia cooperi, and the {{two species}} interact, with H.cymboformis <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> the cliffs, and H.cooperi <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> the lowland plains.|$|R
50|$|Mockernut <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> Inceptisols in an {{estimated}} 15 {{percent of its}} range. These clayey soils are moderate to high in nutrients and are primarily in the Appalachians on gentle to moderate slopes where water is available to plants during the growing season. In the northern Appalachians on slopes of 25 percent or less, mockernut hickory <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> poorly drained loams with a fragipan. In the central and southern Appalachians on slopes 25 percent or less, mockernut hickory <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> fine loams. On steeper slopes it <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> coarse loams.|$|R
50|$|Ganoderma tsugae - A polypore which <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> conifers, {{especially}} hemlock; {{thus the}} common name, Hemlock varnish shelf. Similar in appearance to Ganoderma lucidum, which typically <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> hardwoods.|$|R
5|$|Their native {{habitats}} {{are very}} varied, with different elevations, bioclimatic areas and substrates, being found predominantly in open spaces ranging from low marshes to rocky hillsides and montane pastures, and including grassland, scrub, woods, river banks and rocky crevices. Although requirements vary, overall {{there is a}} preference for acidic soils, although some species will <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> limestone. Narcissus scaberulus will <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> granite soils where it is moist in the growing season but dry in the summer, while Narcissus dubius thrives best in regions with hot and dry summers.|$|E
5|$|This variety has a closed, bulb-like rosette {{of winter}} leaves which are {{acicular}} (pointy) at the tip. It tends to <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> igneous substrates.|$|E
5|$|Amanita ravenelii is a {{mycorrhizal}} fungus, {{meaning it}} forms mutualistic associations with shrubs and trees. Mushrooms <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> the ground solitarily, scattered, or in groups in mixed coniferous and deciduous forests. Although the specific tree associations preferred by A.ravenelii are unknown, in general, Amanita from section Lepidella tend {{to associate with}} diploxylon pine (that is, pines in subgenus Pinus), oak, and hickory.|$|E
50|$|Mackay's fragile fern <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> rock or in scree, {{generally}} in sheltered spots, {{in the northeastern}} United States. It may be distinguished from the somewhat similar Cystopteris tennesseensis {{by the fact that}} it <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> acid substrate, while the tennesseensis <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> calcareous substrate. The fronds of tenuis are broader, with generally alternate pinnae, while tennesseensis is narrower, with generally opposite pinnae.|$|R
50|$|It <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> rock {{including}} basalt, pumice, rhyolite, granite, sandstone, and limestone. Sometimes it can {{be found}} <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> bark. It may be tightly or loosely attached to the substrate.|$|R
5000|$|Crustose lichens grow {{flat against}} the surface that the colonies are <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> (substrate), {{typically}} rocks or wood. The plant grows tightly appressed to the substrate, and {{is very close to}} the substrates at all points, forming a biological layer. There is overlap between crustose lichens <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> rock with those <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> wood, as well as with lichens listed in other sections of this article.|$|R
5|$|Plant life {{is heavily}} {{influenced}} by the salt spray, strong winds and acidic peaty soils. No trees <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> the archipelago, although {{there are more than}} 130 different flowering plants, 162 species of fungi and 160 bryophytes. Several rarities exist amongst the 194 lichen species. Kelp thrives in the surrounding seas, which contain a diversity of unusual marine invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Rhodotus palmatus is saprobic, {{meaning it}} obtains {{nutrients}} from decomposing organic matter. It grows scattered or clustered {{in small groups}} on rotting hardwoods, such as basswood, maple, and especially elm; in Europe it is known to <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> horse chestnut. The mushroom prefers low-lying logs {{in areas that are}} periodically flooded and that receive little sunlight, such as areas shaded by forest canopy. A pioneer species in the fungal colonization of dead wood, it prefers to <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> relatively undecayed substrates. It is often found growing on dark-stained wood, especially the dried-out upper parts of trunks that have lost their bark. R. palmatus tends to fruit in cooler and moister weather, from spring to autumn in the United States, or autumn to winter in Britain and Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{animals that}} eat the figs {{disperse}} the seeds, which then germinate and <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> other plants (epiphytes) or on rocks (lithophytes). As the new plants develop, they send roots {{to the forest}} floor. Figs growing on other plants grow larger and larger until they strangle their hosts. Ficus obliqua is long-lived, and trees are thought to live in excess of 500 years.|$|E
50|$|Epizoic {{organisms are}} those that live non-parasitically {{on the surface of}} animals. Examples of epizoic species include mosses, algae, and fungi <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> Gymnopholus weevils, and bryozoans (moss animals) <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> other animals.|$|R
50|$|S. ficus {{is found}} <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> rocks {{from the lower}} shore down {{to a depth of}} two hundred metres and prefers {{locations}} with strong tidal flows. It often grows among seaweed and is also found on harbour structures and wreckage. When it <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> a stone or an empty gastropod or bivalve shell it may completely engulf it. It sometimes <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> a shell housing a living hermit crab.|$|R
50|$|Aizoago is a fungal genus in {{the family}} Ustilaginaceae. Circumscribed in 2013, it {{contains}} two species of smut fungi found in Australia. Aizoago tetragoniae <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> Tetragonia diptera, while A. tetragonioides <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> Tetragonia tetragonioides.|$|R
5|$|The eastern {{serpentine}} outcrops where A.viridimontanum thrives {{have relatively}} few endemics, compared to serpentine exposures globally. A.viridimontanum {{is one of}} only five taxa (four species and a variety) that are strictly endemic to serpentine in eastern North America, and two of these, A.aleuticum and Aspidotis densa, <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> non-serpentine substrates elsewhere in North America.|$|E
5|$|Tylopilus alboater is a {{mycorrhizal}} species, and its fruit bodies <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> {{the ground}} solitarily, scattered, or in groups under deciduous trees, particularly oak.

5|$|Although {{each type}} of tea has {{different}} taste, smell, and visual appearance, tea processing for all tea types consists of a very similar set of methods with only minor variations. Without careful moisture and temperature control during its manufacture and life thereafter, fungi will <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> tea. This form of fungus causes real fermentation that will contaminate the tea and may render the tea unfit for consumption.|$|E
40|$|Summary To {{investigate}} morphological acclimation {{to differences}} in nutrient availability, we compared shoot and needle morphology of Picea glehnii (Friedr. Schmidt) M. T. Mast. and Picea jezoensis (Siebold & Zucc.) CarriÃ¨re trees <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> nutrient-poor volcanic ash and nutrient-rich, brown forest soil. Trees of both species were shorter and had more open canopies when <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> volcanic ash than when <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> brown forest soil. Nutrient-poor conditions limited height growth less in P. glehnii than in P. jezoensis. In both species, trees <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> volcanic ash had shorter annual in-crements {{in the previous year}} and more needles per shoot length and, hence, a smaller shoot silhouette area (SSA) rela-tive to needle dry mass (NDM) than trees <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> brown forest soil. Soil type had less effect on shoot projected needle area (PNA). Total needle area (TNA) of P. glehnii shoots wa...|$|R
50|$|It <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> {{the well}} drained, sunny, rocky mountainsides. On stony slopes, stony heaths and on rocky ground. It {{has been found}} with Fritillaria fleischeriana found <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> areas of rocky {{limestone}} amongst scattered juniper trees.|$|R
50|$|Nigroporus vinosus is a {{white rot}} fungus that {{typically}} <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> the decaying wood of hardwood trees, although {{it has also been}} recorded <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> pine. Fruit bodies occur singly, in groups, or in overlapping clusters.|$|R
5|$|Collectively, Hygrophoropsis is a {{widespread}} genus, found in both Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca is the most widely distributed species, found on several continents. The other species are not well-known and have more limited ranges. Fruit bodies <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> the ground in woodlands, on moss, and peat, and on woodchips. Hygrophoropsis is a saprophytic genus, and causes brown rot in the wood it colonises. Some species may be facultatively mycorrhizal.|$|E
5|$|Collybia cirrhata is {{most likely}} to be {{confused}} with the remaining members of Collybia, which have a similar external appearance. C.tuberosa is distinguished by its dark reddish-brown sclerotia that resemble apple seeds, while C.cookei has wrinkled, often irregularly shaped sclerotia that are pale yellow to orange. Other similar mushrooms include Baeospora myosura and species of Strobilurus, but these species only <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> pine cones.|$|E
5|$|Copper is biostatic, meaning {{bacteria}} {{and many other}} forms of life will not <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> it. For this reason {{it has long been}} used to line parts of ships to protect against barnacles and mussels. It was originally used pure, but has since been superseded by Muntz metal and copper-based paint. Similarly, as discussed in copper alloys in aquaculture, copper alloys have become important netting materials in the aquaculture industry because they are antimicrobial and prevent biofouling, even in extreme conditions and have strong structural and corrosion-resistant properties in marine environments.|$|E
5000|$|Drynaria roosii is an epiphytic (<b>growing</b> <b>on</b> trees) or epipetric (<b>growing</b> <b>on</b> rocks) plant. Like {{other species}} of Drynaria, they possess two frond types [...] - [...] a fertile foliage frond and a sterile nest frond.|$|R
