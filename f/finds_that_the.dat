5|$|Wallace visits Menado on the {{northeast}} coast of Celebes. The people of the Minahasa region are fair-skinned, unlike {{anywhere else in the}} archipelago. He stays high in the mountains by the coffee plantations, and is often cold, but <b>finds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> animals are no different from those lower down. The forest was full of orchids, bromeliads, clubmosses and mosses. He experiences an earthquake, but the low timber-framed houses survive with little damage. He <b>finds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> people, under the guidance of missionaries, are the most hard-working, peaceful and civilised of the whole archipelago. He obtains (apparently by purchase) skulls of the babirusa (pig-deer) and the rare sapiutan (midget buffalo).|$|E
5|$|In Act I, the Shard-bearer's story resumes {{after the}} defeat of the King of Shadows. The player awakens alone in an {{underground}} barrow in Rashemen, where he meets Safiya, a Red Wizard of Thay. The player follows Safiya to the Veil Theater in the nearby town of Mulsantir, hoping to find Lienna, an acquaintance of Safiya’s mother, who is supposed to provide the player with some much-needed answers. Unfortunately, the player <b>finds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> theater has been attacked by Red Wizards, and Lienna has been killed. At the back of the theater, the player finds a portal to the Plane of Shadow, a dark reflection of the Prime Material Plane, where he defeats the Red Wizards who murdered Lienna. Upon returning to the Prime Material Plane, the player <b>finds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> spirit-god Okku has besieged Mulsantir, demanding the player’s blood. The player confronts Okku and defeats his spirit army. At the end of the battle, the player learns that he has become a spirit-eater, an accursed being who must feed upon feys and elementals (and sometimes mortal souls) in order to survive.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to provide}} a coherent explanation for the post-analyst recommendation drift. First, I <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> post-analyst recommendation drift is explained by the degree of attention paid by individual investors. Second I <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> extremeness and the credibility of information leads to changes in the degree of attention and a post-analyst recommendation drift. Finally, I <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> diffusion of private information contained in the analyst recommendation interacts with attention related biases leading to a post-recommendation drift...|$|R
40|$|We <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{successive}} increments in {{the cardiac}} beat-to-beat intervals of healthy subjects display scale-invariant, long-range anticorrelations (up to 10 exp 4 heart beats). Furthermore, we <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> histogram for the heartbeat intervals increments is well {{described by a}} Levy (1991) stable distribution. For a group of subjects with severe heart disease, we <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> distribution is unchanged, but the long-range correlations vanish. Therefore, the different scaling behavior in health and disease must relate to the underlying dynamics of the heartbeat...|$|R

5|$|Archaeological, biogeographical, and {{linguistic}} evidence {{suggest that the}} donkey was first domesticated by nomadic pastoral people in North Africa over 5,000 years ago. The animals were used to help cope with the increased aridity of the Sahara and the Horn of Africa. Genetic evidence <b>finds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> donkey was domesticated twice based on two distinct mitochondrial DNA haplogroups. It also points to a single ancestor, the Nubian wild ass. Attempts to domesticate zebras were largely unsuccessful, though Walter Rothschild trained some to draw a carriage in England.|$|E
5|$|Because Roger {{unfortunately}} {{appears at}} every {{scene of crime}} just as the murders take place, he is ruled as the prime suspect. Roger and Billy Budget then theorize that announcer Dexter Morris is the next to die. Dexter ignores their warning and is killed by electrocution. By going through private documents in WBN's file room, Roger <b>finds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> victims all previously worked together at a radio station in Peoria, Illinois, which he then correlates into a secretive FCC scandal. King (laughing gas) and General Whalen (falls down an elevator shaft) are the next to die after Roger's warning, causing even more suspicion from the police.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the effect of}} the ultraviolet (UV) or short wavelength modes on the background of Brane Gas Cosmology. We <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> string matter sources are negligible in <b>the</b> UV and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> evolution is given primarily by the dilaton perturbation. We also <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> linear perturbations are well behaved and the predictions of Brane Gas Cosmology are robust against the introduction of linear perturbations. In particular, we <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> stabilization of the extra dimensions (moduli) remains valid in the presence of dilaton and string perturbations.

40|$|We {{calculate}} the shot noise power in ballistic graphene using the kinetic equation approach {{based on the}} Keldysh technique. We <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> local energy distribution function obeys Poisson's equation, indicating a mapping into a diffusive metal system. We derive the conductance and noise including the long range Coulomb interaction to first order. We <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> shot noise increases due to interaction, leading to a frequency dependence. Furthermore, we <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Fano factor at degeneracy is 1 / 3, the same as without the Coulomb interaction. Comment: Extended version. 6 pages, 2 figur...|$|R

During the case, in talking with the latest victim's wife, Olivia realizes that she is truly in love with Peter. After {{the conclusion of the}} case, she admits to Nina that she will let the memory alterations continue, even if this means she will forget the times she spent with Nina during her childhood.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the interaction of}} fiscal and current account balances in open economies subject to monopolistic competition with sticky price-setting behavior, adjustment costs for investment, and distortionary labor income taxes. We <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> elasticity of exports {{with respect to the}} real exchange rate influences the correlation between the balances. In particular, in simulations with recurring shocks to productivity, we <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> balances are positively correlated for a range of export elasticities. However, for simulations with recurring real government expenditure shocks, we <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> balances are positively correlated under high export elasticity but negatively correlated under low export elasticity. ...|$|R

Incanto is forced to flee before he can fully dissolve the body. At the autopsy, Scully <b>finds</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> body's airways are choked with the same substance that dissolved Lauren. The State Genetic Lab report reveals that the skin under the victim's nails contains no oils or fatty acids, convincing Mulder that the killer is sucking body fat from his victims.|$|E

Mulder calls Cassandra, looking for Scully, but Jeffrey answers and reveals that Cassandra is gone. At that moment Cassandra is {{with a group of}} abductees, including Scully, at the Ruskin Dam, brought there by Syndicate assassin Quiet Willy. The abductees see a UFO appear in the sky.
