5|$|Before going {{hunting the}} next day Bertilak proposes a bargain: he will give Gawain {{whatever}} he catches {{on the condition that}} Gawain give him whatever he might gain during the day. Gawain accepts. After Bertilak leaves, Lady Bertilak visits Gawain's bedroom and behaves seductively, but despite her best efforts he yields nothing but a single kiss in his unwillingness to offend her. When Bertilak returns and gives Gawain the deer he has killed, his guest gives a kiss to Bertilak without divulging its source. The next day the lady comes again, Gawain again courteously foils her advances, and later that day there is a similar exchange of a hunted boar for two <b>kisses.</b> She comes once more on the third morning, this time offering Gawain a gold ring as a keepsake. He gently but steadfastly refuses but she pleads that he at least take her belt, a girdle of green and gold silk which, the lady assures him, is charmed and will keep him from all physical harm. Tempted, as he may otherwise die {{the next day}}, Gawain accepts it, and they exchange three <b>kisses.</b> That evening, Bertilak returns with a fox, which he exchanges with Gawain for the three <b>kisses</b> – but Gawain says nothing of the girdle.|$|E

40|$|Kisspeptin was {{originally}} found as a peptide product of <b>Kiss</b> 1 gene {{and is now}} {{supposed to be an}} essential central regulator of reproduction in mammals. However, there is now a growing body of evidence to suggest that <b>kiss</b> 2, the paralogous gene for <b>kiss</b> 1, evolved in parallel during vertebrate lineage, and the <b>kiss</b> 2 product also activates the GPR 54 (kisspeptin receptor) signaling pathways. Therefore, it is now widely accepted that both <b>kiss</b> 1 and <b>kiss</b> 2 are the kisspeptin genes. Interestingly, either <b>kiss</b> 1 or <b>kiss</b> 2 or both have been lost during evolution in many vertebrate species, and the functional significance of <b>kiss</b> 1 or <b>kiss</b> 2 for the central regulation of reproduction is suggested to vary according to the species. Here, we argue that the steroid sensitivity of the <b>kiss</b> 1 or <b>kiss</b> 2 neurons has been well conserved during evolution among tetrapods and teleosts, and thus it may be the key to understanding the functional homologies of certain populations of kisspeptin (<b>kiss</b> 1 or <b>kiss</b> 2) neurons among different species of vertebrates. In the present review, we will first introduce recent advances in the study of steroid sensitive <b>kiss</b> 1 and <b>kiss</b> 2 systems in vertebrates and effects of peptide administrations in vivo. By comparing the similarities and differences between <b>kiss</b> 1 and <b>kiss</b> 2 of neuronal localization and sensitivity to gonadal steroids in various tetrapods and teleosts, we discuss the evolution of kisspeptin neuronal systems after gene duplication of ancestral kisspeptin genes to give rise to <b>kiss</b> 1 and <b>kiss</b> 2...|$|R
