40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to look at}} model {{retirement}} {{behavior with}} a focus on early retirement where there is an option for “buy-outs”. An employer can offer employees generous pension programs if the employees agree on early retirement. Earlier studies have neglected such offers, but in doing so, estimates of the individuals' responses to financial incentives in a retirement decision are likely to be biased upward. Design/methodology/approach – The authors propose an estimation strategy where the retirement decision and the accesses to <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>pension</b> (ERP) offers are estimated in a simultaneous equation system, yielding unbiased estimates of the model parameters. They apply the model using detailed Swedish register data. Findings – The results indicate that the marginal effects in retirement probability with respect to a change in financial incentives is less pronounced if ERPs are accounted for. Further, results imply that the early retirement probabilities would decrease, depending on year, by 14 - 28 percent for males and 7 - 18 percent for females if ERP offers were absent. Research limitations/implications – As the motives for early retirement pensions most likely stem from how the collective agreement occupational pensions are financed, this emphasizes the need for a debate on the preferable construction of these systems. This becomes particularly important in view of the increased old age dependency ratios that are expected in the near future. Originality/value – Although these offers have important policy implications they have received limited attention. This paper fills an important gap in the existing pension literature, and it analyzes early retirement and tries to assess the importance of special <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>pension</b> programs for these outcomes.

40|$|The {{policy agenda}} of {{extending}} working lives requires a holistic understanding of factors underlying {{the decision of}} older workers to withdraw from work and to retire. This brief paper presents employment patterns and trends of older people across EU Member States and identifies policy initiatives that would encourage more flexible and later retirement. The descriptive empirical evidence (from the EU Labour Force Survey) indicates {{that there are a}} broad range of experiences in EU countries with respect to the employment of older workers (those aged 50 and over). Strikingly, in the majority of EU 15 countries, close to one-half of those of 50 and over are either unemployed or inactive, with reliance either on <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>pensions</b> or on social assistance benefits. The recent pension reforms in a number of these countries have increased the retirement age and this is likely to induce older workers to work longer. There is already some evidence that the effective retirement age is on the increase. Results suggest that the increase in older workers' employment is stronger for women than for men, and also for more highly educated. In most instances older workers either tend to be in full-time employment or inactive with very few occupying intermediate positions. Although there is some evidence of a gradual transition towards retirement, there is still a relatively minor proportion of the work force taking advantage of this, as well over 70 % of men and around 55 % of women in employment in their early 60 s worked 35 hours a week or more. The policy aim should therefore be to encourage 'flexible and later retirement'. Additional incentives need to be provided so that people are not only able to move between jobs in later working life but also able to work part-time, without losing their entitlement to benefits (such as <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>pensions).</b> Such policy incentives will enable workers to avoid the phenomenon of a 'cliff-edge' fall into retirement that many of them often face.

However, oftentimes policies aiming at rising employment rates of older workers fall short in delaying retirement. This {{seems to be the}} case with retirement age flexibility reforms in Portugal. We analyze the recent Portuguese history of incentives to retire. For 1990 - 2006 we find that individuals faced very high implicit taxes on working with the result that half the workers had already left the labour force before age 65. We then look at the Social Security reforms in 2007 and find that the incentives to continue working became even smaller than they already were.

30|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1999, {{and in the course}} of macroeconomic growth, the age of access to retirement was rendered more flexible, according to contributions’ profiles. In this sense, a new law made it possible for workers at least 55  years old and a working career of 30 complete calendar years to become eligible for pension benefits. Even though there was a reduction factor linked to early retirement pensions, this flexibility imposed significant financial pressure on the Social Security system. As a consequence, the legal norms that allowed access to a pension before the worker reached the legal retirement age were suspended in 2005. Early retirement schemes became once again possible in 2007, over a new law that was published for discussion in November 2006, but with severe penalties imposed to pensions.

The ordinary retirement age is 65. For those who started contributing to the system after 1967 and since the 2002 amendment, <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> at age 61 is permitted with strict requirements. Namely, they have to (a) certify a minimum effective contribution period of 30  years, (b) be registered as a job seeker, in the public employment service offices, during a period of 6  months immediately prior to the date of the retirement application and (c) the job termination should not been caused by worker’s free will. <b>Early</b> <b>retirement</b> at age 60 is permitted (if the minimum period of contributions is satisfied), according to the rules of a transient law, for those who contributed to labour mutual funds that preceded the establishment of the social security system. The amount of all <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>pensions</b> are subject to reduction coefficients. Finally, retirement at 64  years, certifying the minimum period of contributions, is possible if the firm hires another worker for a minimum period of 1  year to replace the retiree.

As Estonia belongs to the group of EU countries where both taxes and social expenditures are relatively low, they generate high motivation to actively participate in the labour market, in general. Also the gradual introduction of contribution based and earnings related benefits, such as unemployment insurance benefits, parental benefits, a fully funded pension scheme together with earnings-related public pension scheme have all significantly increased rewards from employment and are often associated with increased labour supply as well as a reduction in undeclared work. The increase of the statutory retirement ages for men and women have increased average employment rates of the elderly, but also retirement through alternative schemes, most notably disability <b>pensions</b> and <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>pensions.</b> In a few cases, the Estonian benefit schemes generate disincentives to seek for a job or increase labour effort, affecting people both with low and high earnings. In case of unemployment benefits and <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> benefits, even marginal income from labour leads to loss of all benefits, thus discouraging part time work. Also there are very high effective marginal tax rates when increasing work effort when receiving subsistence benefits and parental benefits, in certain cases. These disincentives become even more significant in this economic crisis when people are faced with long-term unemployment and it is vital that they are encouraged to return to the labour market.

40|$|Long term {{occupational}} exposure to organic solvents may cause adverse effects {{to the central}} nervous system. This collaborative study between six Swedish departments of occupational medicine examines the overall prognosis in terms of working capacity, symptoms, and psychometric test performance for individuals occupationally exposed to organic solvents. After re-analyses of the data from an initial clinical investigation of 111 men, the subjects {{were divided into two}} subgroups: one group of 65 with symptoms but no impairment on the tests and one group of 46 with toxic encephalopathy (symptoms and test impairment). At least five years after the initial examination the subjects were asked to attend a re-examination that included a structured medical interview and a psychometric investigation. The results indicate that effects on the central nervous system persist even when exposure has ceased. In the group of 46 more men had stopped working and were receiving sickness or <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> <b>pensions.</b> This group also had reduced activity levels with regard to everyday life, leisure activities, and education or training and more neuropsychiatric symptoms. There was no support for the view that a solvent induced toxic encephalopathy is a progressive disease comparable with presenile dementia such as Alzheimer's disease or Pick's disease. If a worker was removed from exposure when he presented symptoms without signs of impairment in intellectual function recovery was seen in most cases...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} <b>early</b> <b>retirement</b> option {{programs in}} collective agreements in Sweden during the 1990 s. We highlight {{the differences between}} actual pension benefits and those stipulated in the standard agreements. We find that the individuals frequently face far better options than those given by standard agreements. The mix and the timing of pensions is usually done in a non-trivial way. Thus, if we just relied on the standard agreement text, one important implication of these findings is {{that the effects of}} economic incentives on retirement very well might be over-estimated.
