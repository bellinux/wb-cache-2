40|$|Any {{defect in}} the {{software}} module or a project can hamper the quality of software projects that leads to failure of the projects, so prediction of defects {{is a very important}} task in the development of software development life cycle (SDLC). In this research paper an algorithmic approach is proposed that will compare the probability of defects due to indirect coupling in the software modules with respect to <b>direct</b> <b>coupled</b> modules. Since the indirect coupling in the software modules can be find out by taking the transitive closure between different modules, but predicting the probability of defects in the software modules via <b>direct</b> <b>coupling</b> is always been a tough task for the programmers, as there may be various hidden dependencies which cannot be exactly detected by <b>direct</b> <b>coupling</b> between software modules. So this paper provides an extension of the previous work done on <b>direct</b> <b>coupled</b> modules, for finding increased probability of defects or faults between dependent modules by indirect coupling approach...|$|R

5000|$|Each terminal, RT, BC, or BM, is {{connected}} to the bus through a stub, formed of a length of cable of the same type as the bus itself. MIL-STD-1553B defines two ways of coupling these stubs to the bus: transformer <b>coupled</b> stubs and <b>direct</b> <b>coupled</b> stubs. Transformer coupled stubs are preferred for their fault tolerance and better matching to the impedance of the bus, and consequent reduction in reflections, etc. The appendix to MIL-STD-1553B (in section 10.5, Stubbing) states [...] "The preferred method of stubbing is to use transformer coupled stubs… This method provides the benefits of DC isolation, increased common mode rejection, a doubling of effective stub impedance, and fault isolation for the entire stub and terminal. <b>Direct</b> <b>coupled</b> stubs… should be avoided if at all possible. <b>Direct</b> <b>coupled</b> stubs provide no DC isolation or common mode rejection for the terminal external to its subsystem. Further, any shorting fault between the subsystems sic internal isolation resistors (usually on a circuit board) and the main bus junction will cause failure of that entire bus. It can be expected that when the <b>direct</b> <b>coupled</b> stub length exceeds 1.6 feet meters, that it will begin to distort the main bus waveforms." ...|$|R

50|$|In <b>direct</b> <b>coupled</b> OTL designs, {{both the}} {{necessary}} blocking of DC and matching of impedances are accomplished, respectively, through the topology of the amplifier's output section and {{the selection of}} vacuum tube types with sufficiently low impedance to allow effective power transfer to the loudspeaker. Typically, <b>direct</b> <b>coupled</b> OTL amplifiers will have a user-adjustable DC offset control, which allows the user to trim off any residual DC voltage residing at the amplifier's output terminals prior to operation. Servo-controlled variants also exist.|$|R
50|$|Like the <b>direct</b> <b>coupled</b> designs, capacitively coupled designs {{rely on the}} {{selection}} of tube types with a sufficiently low impedance to effect the transfer of power to the loudspeaker. However, unlike <b>direct</b> <b>coupled</b> designs, capacitively coupled designs do not have inherent DC blocking {{by virtue of their}} topology. Instead, DC voltage in the output section is blocked by an output coupling capacitor - typically a large-value (3000-6000μF) electrolytic capacitor - which is interposed between the amplifier's output section and the loudspeaker.|$|R

40|$|Chapter II: Codeine-binding RNA aptamers {{and rapid}} {{determination}} of their binding constants using a <b>direct</b> <b>coupling</b> surface plasmon resonance assay* RNA aptamers that bind the opium alkaloid codeine were generated using an iterative in vitro selection process. The binding properties of these aptamers, including equilibrium and kinetic rate constants, were determined through a rapid, high-throughput approach using surface plasmon resonance analysis to measure real-time binding. The approach involves <b>direct</b> <b>coupling</b> {{of the target}} small molecule onto a sensor chip without utilization of a carrier protein. Two highest binding aptamer sequences, FC 5 and FC 45 with Kd values of 2. 50 μM and 4. 00 μM, respectively, were extensively studied. Corresponding mini-aptamers for FC 5 and FC 45 were subsequently identified through the described <b>direct</b> <b>coupling</b> Biacore assays. These assays were also employed to confirm the proposed secondary structures of the miniaptamers. Both aptamers exhibit high specificity to codeine over morphine, which differs from codeine by a methyl group. Finally, the <b>direct</b> <b>coupling</b> method was demonstrated to eliminate potential non-specific interactions that {{may be associated with}} indirect coupling methods in which protein linkers are commonly employed. Therefore, in addition to presenting the first RNA aptamers to a subclass of benzylisoquinoline alkaloid molecules, this work highlights a method for characterizing small-molecule aptamers that is more robust, precise, rapid, and high-throughput than other commonly employed techniques...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{entanglement}} between two coupled detectors, whose internal {{degrees of freedom}} are modeled by harmonic oscillators, interacting with a common quantum field, paying special attention to two less studied yet important features: finite separation and <b>direct</b> <b>coupling.</b> Distance dependence is essential in quantum teleportation and relativistic quantum information considerations. The presence of a quantum field as the environment accords an indirect interaction between the two oscillators at finite separation of a non-Markovian nature which competes with the <b>direct</b> <b>coupling</b> between them. The interplay between these two factors results in a rich variety of interesting entanglement behaviors at late times. We show that the entanglement behavior reported in prior work assuming no separation between the detectors can at best be a transient effect at very short times, and claims that such behaviors represent late time entanglement are misplaced. Entanglement between the detectors with <b>direct</b> <b>coupling</b> enters in the consideration of macroscopic quantum phenomena and other frontline issues. We find that with <b>direct</b> <b>coupling</b> entanglement between the two detectors can sustain over a finite distance, {{in contrast to the}} no-direct coupling case reported before, where entanglement can not survive at separation more than a few inverse high frequency cutoff scales. This work provides a solid platform necessary for further systematic investigations into the entanglement behavior of continuous variable quantum systems. Comment: 40 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

So they were only used if the gain was specified down to DC (e.g., in an oscilloscope). In the context of modern electronics developers are encouraged to use directly coupled amplifiers whenever possible.
