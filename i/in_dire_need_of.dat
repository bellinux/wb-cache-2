5|$|Following {{the failure}} of the Kiev Offensive, the Polish armies retreated westwards from central Belarus and Ukraine. Although the Bolshevik forces failed to {{surround}} or destroy the bulk of the Polish Army, most Polish units were <b>in</b> <b>dire</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> fresh reinforcements. The Polish command hoped to halt the advancing Russian forces in front of Warsaw, the capital of Poland. At the same time General (later Marshal of Poland) Józef Piłsudski was to lead a flanking manoeuvre from the area of the Wieprz River, while General Władysław Sikorski's 5th Army was to leave the Modlin Fortress and head north-east, to cut off the Soviet forces heading westwards, {{to the north of the}} bend of the Vistula and Bugonarew and on towards Pomerania. However, for this plan to succeed, it was vital that Polish forces hold Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|During an autopsy, Scully {{correctly}} deduces that Arlen was {{blinded by}} reptile venom. Meanwhile, Doggett and Harrison, having fallen into old bootlegger tunnels below the mansion grounds, encounter the creature and are sprayed with venom, temporarily blinding them. The two find Gary Sacks <b>in</b> <b>dire</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> medical attention nearby. Noting Doggett and Harrison's absence, Mulder searches {{the area around}} the mansion for clues and encounters the owner, Herman Stites, who identifies himself as a biologist. Mulder soon leaves the area as Stites notices Doggett about to escape the tunnels and knocks him back in. Mulder waits in his car in Stites' driveway until dark, telling Scully that he found the Apollo medallion near Stites' estate and is convinced Doggett is somewhere nearby. He spots the creature and chases it to the mansion where it climbs up to a second floor. Mulder follows the creature into the house and down into the tunnels, where he encounters Harrison and Doggett. With the creature approaching, Mulder tells the still-blinded Doggett to open fire at him on his command. The blinded Doggett then shoots the creature as it leaps at Mulder; the deceased creature then turns into Stites.|$|E
5|$|When King Rama V {{ascended the}} throne in 1868, {{he decided to}} build a new group of grander throne halls to replace the old structures. The first phase of {{construction}} began in 1868, then again in 1876, and the final phase between 1882 and 1887. King Rama V resided in the palace until 1910 when he gradually moved to the new Dusit Palace, {{to the north of the}} Grand Palace. King Rama VI occasionally stayed in the palace; however he preferred his other residences in the country. By the reign of King Rama VII the buildings were <b>in</b> <b>dire</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> renovations, but due to economic constraints only the Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall was renovated. This work was carried out by Prince Itthithepsan Kritakara, an architectural graduate of the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Many of his works can still be seen today. During the reign of King Rama IX many of the buildings once more became so dilapidated that they needed to be demolished altogether. In their stead new halls were constructed in 2004 to replace them.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps Szigeti's most {{fruitful}} musical partnership {{was with}} his friend Béla Bartók. The first piece Bartók dedicated to him was the First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra (or piano) of 1928; the rhapsody, based on both Romanian and Hungarian folk tunes, {{was one of a}} pair of violin rhapsodies written in 1928 (the other being dedicated to Zoltán Székely.) In 1938, Szigeti and clarinetist Benny Goodman teamed up to commission a trio from Bartók: originally intended to be a short work just long enough to fill both sides of a 78rpm record, the piece soon expanded beyond its modest intent and became the three-movement Contrasts for piano, violin and clarinet. In 1944, by which time Szigeti and Bartók had both fled to the United States to escape the war in Europe, Bartók's health was failing and he had sunk into depression. He was <b>in</b> <b>dire</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> money, but felt no inspiration to compose and was convinced that his works would never sell to an American audience. Szigeti came to his friend's aid by securing donations from the American Society of Composers and Publishers to pay for Bartók's medical treatment, and then, together with conductor and compatriot Fritz Reiner, persuaded Serge Koussevitzky to commission from Bartók what eventually became his much-beloved Concerto for Orchestra. The work's success brought Bartók some measure of financial security and provided him with a much-needed emotional boost.|$|E
5|$|The city soon {{experienced}} {{its most}} dire fiscal crisis yet, {{due to the}} stagnant economy of the early 1970s, combined with the massive outflow of city residents to the suburbs. The system was already in decline; the subway had seen a 40% decrease in ridership since 1947, and a $200 million subsidy for the MTA {{as well as a}} 1952 fare increase had not been enough to pay for basic upkeep for the subway system, let alone fund massive expansion projects like the Second Avenue Subway. When plans were finalized in 1971, the subway had been proposed for completion by 1980, but two years later, its completion date was forecast as 2000. In October 1974, the MTA chairman, David Yunich, announced that the completion of the line north of 42nd Street was pushed back to 1983 and the portion to the south in 1988. On December 13, 1974, New York City mayor Abraham Beame proposed a six-year transit construction program that would reallocate $5.1 billion of funding from the Second Avenue Line to complete new lines in Queens and to modernize the existing infrastructure, which was rapidly deteriorating and <b>in</b> <b>dire</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> repair. Beame issued a stop-work order for the line in September 1975, whereupon construction of the section between Second and Ninth Streets was halted, and no other funding was allocated to the line's construction. Besides the Chrystie Street Connection, only three sections of tunnel had been completed; these tunnels were sealed.|$|E
5|$|John died in 1216 and was {{succeeded by}} his nine-year-old son, Henry, {{with the support}} of the barons. With no {{prospect}} of becoming King of England, Louis returned to France. Rochester Castle was returned to royal control in 1217. Given the damage incurred during John's siege, the castle was <b>in</b> <b>dire</b> <b>need</b> <b>of</b> repairs. Between 1217 and 1237 around £680 were spent on repairs, of which £530 were taken up by work on the keep. In 1225 and 1226 the town walls were enhanced by the addition of a ditch at the cost of £300. The new ditch enclosed Boley Hill, possibly to deny the position to future aggressors who might attack the castle. Repairs began with the castle's outer curtain wall. At the same time a chapel was built within the castle. In 1226 the hall, buttery, and dispensary were repaired. Work probably did not begin on the keep until 1226. It was mostly repaired by 1227, but work continued on it until 1232. During 1230 and 1231 a stone wall dividing the castle's enclosure into two parts was built which no longer survives. While attention was paid to making the castle a working fortification, Henry III also funded construction of residential and other buildings. In 1244, £132 was spent on building a second chapel next to the royal apartments. Stables and an almonry were added in 1248. The main gatehouse was rebuilt between 1249 and 1250 at a cost of over £120. Further repairs were carried out on the keep in 1256, this time costing more than £120. Later in the decade further attention was paid to the castle's defences, possibly in response to HenryIII's worsening relations with his barons.|$|E

40|$|Large {{construction}} projects in Yemen face many impediments and challenges {{to be completed}} successfully. This article presents an investigative cases study of three mega {{construction projects}} which are considered failed to achieve their assigned plans and objectives. An exploratory interview was implied in this study via telephone to three construction experts who involved directly in these mega projects at the managerial level. Semi-structured questions based on literature were designed as guide for the interview where the scope was mainly on causes of the mega projects failure. Outcomes from this study found that Yemen construction industry lacks of proper accrediting system to accredit construction stakeholders (contactors, consultant); improper planning for cost and time, lack of effective communication and coordination platforms and lack of advanced technology which are considered amongst the crucial challenges faced by industry. Hence, Yemeni construction industry is <b>in</b> <b>dire</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> an effective platforms and system to administer project communication, information and coordination. Findings of this study can be useful for Yemeni construction community to understand causes of the failure and suggestions provided by experts are also very helpful in creating better quality works...|$|R

Increased development raises its own dilemma, on one side the people <b>in</b> <b>dire</b> <b>needs</b> <b>of</b> development, but on the other side occurs that changed the moral decline in adolescent values, norms and lifestyles are followed by a media revolution and an increasingly independent behavior. This study aims to determine the influence of life skills on sexual behavior in adolescents. This research was done in May-June 2011 in the Seberang Ulu Area. Methods: This is quantitative research with cross sectional approach. The subject were all of adolescents aged 12 - 21 years in Seberang Ulu area of Palembang City with 96 respondents sample. The statistical test used chi square test by using SPSS version 17 program. Result: The results showed that there is the influence of life skills (p = 0. 015), hard skills (knowledge of sex) (p = 0. 012), soft skills (religiosity, self-confidence, and self-concept) (p = 0. 000) towards sexual behavior in adolescent, partially religiosity (p = 0. 015), confidence (p = 0. 018), and self-concept (p = 0. 027) also influence of sex behavior. Conclusion: Life skills, soft skills, religiosity, self-confidence, and self-concept is a risk factor while the hard skills is preventing factor of free sex in adolescents. We need a development model life skills-based education for free sex prevention...|$|R
