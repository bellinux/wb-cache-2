500|$|In the New Testament, the messianic {{expectations}} {{found in}} early Judaism were fulfilled {{on the day}} of Pentecost as recorded in Acts. The Christian community was gathered together in Jerusalem when a sound from heaven like rushing wind was heard and tongues like tongues of flame rested on everyone. They were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in tongues, miraculously praising God in foreign languages. A crowd gathered and was addressed by the Apostle Peter who stated that the occurrence was the fulfillment of the prophecy of Joel 2, [...] "And in the last days it shall be, God declares, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy". He then explained how the Spirit came to be poured out, recounting Jesus’ ministry and passion and then proclaiming his resurrection and enthronement at the right hand of God. In response, the crowd asked Peter what they should do. He responded that they should repent and be baptized for the forgiveness of sins in order to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Peter finished his speech stating that the promise [...] "is for you and <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>children</b> and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself".|$|E

2500|$|Faxon D. Atherton, {{a native}} of Massachusetts, had spent several years in Chile and Hawaii as a trader in tallow, hides and merchandise. His friend and {{business}} associate, Thomas Lark, had written to him [...] "there is education available <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>children</b> and a dignity of living on landed estates down the San Francisco peninsula (that is) convenient and accessible." [...] Atherton purchased [...] for ten dollars an acre ($2470/km²) in 1860. His home, [...] "Valparaíso Park", was built several years later. It was simple in design and ample for his family of seven children.|$|E
