5|$|The {{date was}} changed {{once more to}} August 3, before it was finally {{released}} in stores on August 24, 1995, {{the same day as}} the Microsoft's operating system Windows 95 version. Phantasmagoria came out first for Windows 95, Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS, then for Macintosh computers in November 1995. A hint book by Sierra came out {{at the same time as}} the game. Phantasmagoria was also ported to Sega Saturn and spanned eight discs exclusively in Japan, where it was fully translated and dubbed into Japanese, and released by Outrigger under the name Phantasm. In response to all the delays, Vince Broady, <b>executive</b> <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> the monthly publication Multimedia World, said Sierra may have been attempting to avoid the same mistakes from the previous year with Outpost, for which the company released many advertisements and reviews, but then over-promoted and released before it was finished. Sierra spokeswoman Kathy Gillmore admitted that mistakes were made in marketing Outpost and Sierra had tried to fix them. The minimum system requirements were an IBM compatible 486–25, 8 megabytes of RAM, 5 megabytes hard disk space, SVGA (256 colors) and a 2x CD-ROM. It supported Sound Blaster-compatible sound cards, and for MS-DOS the game worked with a megahertz chip. It sold for as much as $80 in some stores, but was typically sold for $69.95.|$|E

25|$|For many years, {{he wrote}} a monthly column for the {{bodybuilding}} magazines Muscle & Fitness and Flex. Shortly after being elected governor, he was appointed <b>executive</b> <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> both magazines, in a largely symbolic capacity. The magazines agreed to donate $250,000 {{a year to the}} Governor's various physical fitness initiatives. When the deal, including the contract that gave Schwarzenegger at least $1 million a year, was made public in 2005, many criticized it as being a conflict of interest since the governor's office made decisions concerning regulation of dietary supplements in California. Consequently, Schwarzenegger relinquished the executive editor role in 2005.

Tuten's short fiction has appeared in Granta, Conjunctions, Fence, Fiction, The New Review of Literature, Tri-Quarterly, and Harper's Magazine. In 1973, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Writing and in 2001 was given the Award for Distinguished Writing from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In describing his usage of the past in his novels (where many of them are set), Tuten once stated:The fact that I don’t write about contemporary life doesn’t mean I’m any less taken up with it. I find it too limiting to write about contemporary life just in contemporary diction, however. I don’t think there's enough flexibility. I can imagine writing about characters who feel passion for one another in a contemporary setting but I don’t, as yet, hear the language for that. But I’m always thinking about contemporary life vis a vis the way it looks in the past. I mean how it looks in the past is a reflection of what it is today. That's what interests me. I think I’m always talking about present-day life, not only political life but about the quality of passion, the quality of all relationships and love.|$|E

500|$|In 2010, Cui and Dai were {{performing}} {{field work}} in tropical woodland on Hainan Island, China, studying wood-rotting fungi.

The fruit body was found at an altitude of , in old-growth forest. They were initially unable to identify the specimen as P.ellipsoideus, because of its large size, but tests revealed its identity after samples were taken for analysis. After their initial encounter with the large fruit body, Cui and Dai returned to it on two subsequent occasions, so that they could study it further. Nicholas P. Money, <b>executive</b> <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> Fungal Biology, in which the findings were published, praised the pair for not removing the fruit body, thereby allowing it [...] "to continue its business and to marvel visitors to Hainan Island". The discovery was formally published in Fungal Biology in September 2011, but gained attention in the mainstream press worldwide prior to this.|$|E

500|$|Radical Middle Newsletter proved controversial. [...] Many responded {{positively}} to Satin's new direction. [...] A professor of management, for example, wrote that unlike Satin's former newsletter, Radical Middle spoke about [...] "reality". [...] Scholarly books began citing the newsletter. [...] In {{a book on}} globalization, Walter Truett Anderson said Radical Middle [...] "carries the encouraging news of an emerging group with a different voice, one that is 'nuanced, hopeful, adult'.... It is essentially a willingness to listen to {{both sides of the}} argument." [...] But three objections were often heard. [...] Some critics accused Satin of misguided policy proposals, as when peace studies scholar Michael N. Nagler wrote that the article [...] "praising humanitarian military intervention as the 'peace movement' of our time, is nothing short of an insult... to the real peace movement" [...] [...] Other critics accused Satin of abandoning his old constituency, as when author and former New Options advisor David Korten chided him for consciously choosing pragmatism over idealism. [...] There were also accusations of elitism, as when the <b>executive</b> <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> Yes! [...] magazine said Satin favored globalization because it appealed to his interests and those of his [...] "law school buddies".|$|E
500|$|Tropic Thunder was {{the first}} major studio {{production}} on Kaua'i in five years. After filming was completed, it was deemed the largest production filmed on the island to date, and contributed more than $60 million to the local economy. Tim Ryan, the <b>executive</b> <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> Hawaii Film & Video Magazine, commented on the filming on the island: [...] "I think Tropic Thunder will give Kaua'i much needed and long idled publicity in the production arena ...It should put Kaua'i back on the production consideration radar." [...] Preliminary production crews were on the island starting in December 2006 and principal photography began in July 2007, with filming lasting thirteenweeks over sevenseparate locations on the island. Much of the filming took place on private land as well as conservation status designated areas. Casting calls on the island sought 500 residents to portray the villagers in the film. Two units shot simultaneously on the island from the ground, and an aerial unit shot from helicopters. Many of the sets and the bridge used for one of the final scenes were built in three months. The island's erratic weather hampered filming with rain and lighting issues. The crew also faced complications in moving the equipment and cast due to the difficult terrain.|$|E
500|$|Phantasmagoria {{received}} mixed reviews. Vince Broady, <b>executive</b> <b>editor</b> <b>of</b> Multimedia World, said Sierra {{was smart}} {{to try to}} capture the adult market, which was looking for sophisticated games especially after the popularity of games such as The 7th Guest. Dwight Silverman of the Houston Chronicle declared it the best game of the year, calling it a [...] "masterwork" [...] and [...] "as close as it gets to a film you control", although he said not everyone would appreciate it due to its violent content. Entertainment Weekly gave it a B+ and called it [...] "one of the surest signs yet of computer games approaching the quality level of the movies". The review said it had some suspenseful and novel twists, but also some [...] "horrific touches (that) seem a bit derivative, such as a Freddy Krueger-like nightmare in which hands pull you through a bed". Kim McDaniel of The Salt Lake Tribune called it [...] "the most sophisticated computer game to date" [...] and [...] "a weird, wild, horrific ride {{that will make you}} jump at every turn, even if you aren't normally faint-of-heart". Although McDaniel said it might be easy for experienced gamers, she appreciated that it was more accessible for casual gamers than difficult games like The 7th Guest.|$|E
