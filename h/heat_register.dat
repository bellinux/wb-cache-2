5000|$|For heating purposes, a floor {{register}} is preferred. This {{is because}} hot air rises, {{and as it}} cools it falls. This creates good air circulation in a room, and helps to maintain a more even temperature as hot and cold air is mixed more thoroughly. Floor registers generally have a grille strong enough for a human being to walk on without damaging the grille. It is rare to find a floor register installed less than 6 in {{from the corner of}} a room. When a floor register is not practical or desired, a wall register is used. The correct placement of wall <b>heating</b> <b>registers</b> is critical. Generally, the <b>heating</b> <b>register</b> will be directly across from an exterior window. The hot air from the register will mix with the cold air coming off the window, cool, and drop to the floor—creating good air circulation. However, the hot air must be pushed from the register with enough force (or [...] "throw") so that it will cross the room and reach the window. If there is too little throw, the hot air will stop moving partway across the room, the cold air from the window will not be heated (creating the feeling of a cool draft), and air circulation will suffer.|$|R

Also, the relation among albedo, NDVI, net radiation, sensible and latent heats and soil heat flux were analysed. The studied land uses were: Dense vegetation, irrigation fields and degraded areas (human activities). Eight images of 217 / 64, orbital/point, for the following data: 08 / 24 / 1992, 08 / 14 / 1994, 07 / 02 / 1996, 07 / 11 / 1999, 08 / 17 / 2001, 07 / 06 / 2003, 07 / 14 / 2006 e 08 / 20 / 2008 were used. The images were processed using the software Erdas IMAGINE using 9. 0 IMAGE. The SEBAL algorithm was applied to quantify the latent heat flux from the surface energy balance, which is composed of net radiation (Rn), soil heat flux (G) and sensible heat flux (H).

The impact of specific N and O sites on the carbon surface induced by the high temperature N-functionalization in the temperature range 673 – 873 K was observed by HRTEM as increased nanoparticles dispersion and enhanced metal wetting at the carbon surface. Those small nanoparticles that stabilized at the N-CNTs surface are beneficial for improving catalytic performance. The interaction of O 2 with the metal surface was studied by microcalorimetry. At 353 K, the PVA shell hinders the dissociative oxygen chemisorption at the surface of the fresh catalyst. Differently, a very high (maximum for Pd/N-CNT 873 K 750 kJ mol− 1) and oscillating exothermic differential <b>heat</b> is <b>registered</b> for the washed samples.

50|$|Registers vary in size {{with the}} {{heating and cooling}} {{requirements}} of the room. If a register is too small, the HVAC system will need to push air through the ducts {{at a faster rate}} in order to achieve the desired heating or cooling. This can create rushing sounds which can disturb occupants or interfere with conversation or work (such as sound recording). The velocity of air through a register is usually kept low enough so that it is masked by background noise. (Higher ambient levels of background noise, such as those in restaurants, allow for higher air velocities.) On the other hand, air velocity must be high enough to achieve the desired temperature. Registers are a critical part of the HVAC system. If not properly installed and tightly connected to the ductwork, air will spill around the register and greatly reduce the HVAC system's efficiency. Ideally, a room will have both <b>heating</b> and cooling <b>registers.</b> In practice, cost considerations usually require that heating and cooling be provided by the same register. In such cases, heating most often takes precedence over cooling, and registers are usually found close to the floor.|$|R

The present work {{is a part of the}} preparation of the SAFIR experiment of the European Space Agency onboard the International Space Station. Wave characteristics of the water film flow over a vertical or an inclined plate with a heater have been studied. The fluorescence method was used to measure local instantaneous film thickness. In addition to measure wave characteristics eight capacitance sensors were located as a line across the flow. The process of rivulet formation in a <b>heated</b> film was <b>registered.</b> Two zones of the heat flux effect on liquid film deformation were distinguished. At low heat fluxes, the film flow is hardly deformed. At high heat fluxes the thermocapillary forces provide formation of rivulets and a thin film between them. The measured values of the distance between rivulets depend slightly on the plate inclination angle. It was found that for a positive temperature gradient along the flow, heating may increase the wave amplitude because thermocapillary forces are directed from the valley to the crest of the wave. This effect was shown in the interrivulet zone, where relative wave amplitude and Marangoni number increase with a rise of the heat flux density. © Z-Tec Publishing.

30|$|Commonly, the {{transition}} temperature T_tr, {{the transition}} heat Δ h {{and the specific}} heat capacity c_p of materials are determined by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). This technique allows for a fast and relatively easy determination of these thermal properties, {{but it has a}} fundamental flaw for the characterisation of PCMs: it is fundamentally unable to provide correct data for transitions with large heats involved. This deficiency of DSC is caused by its very measurement principle. In a simplified picture of a heating run on the common heat-flux DSC, the furnace of the DSC is heated up at a fixed scanning rate. The sample cell, in thermal contact with this furnace by means of a heat-flux sensor, follows the temperature evolution of the furnace with a small delay, as the heat needs some time to flow into the sample. When a transition is reached, the sample will need the transition heat at once, in order {{to keep up with the}} furnace, but this is not possible due to the limited thermal conductance of the heat-flux sensor. Thus, the <b>registered</b> <b>heat</b> flow does not correctly relate to the properties of the sample, but rather to the properties of the heat-flux sensor, a situation which persists until all transition heat has been delivered. Even in power-compensated DSCs, which actively provide heat to the sample, this cannot be avoided, as the instantaneous demand for heat during the transition may exceed the power of the heater system.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Patients {{receiving}} {{mechanical ventilation}} and oxygen therapy frequently {{complain about the}} dryness of their airways. Humidifiers increase air humidity by generating water vapour and thus preventing the mucosa from desiccation. In this bench study, we compared the efficiency of several humidifiers. Methods: Two identical humidifiers of each type (HC 602 ®, HumiCare 200 ®, Humid Aire 2 i®, minni-Max®, MR 730 AGM®, REMstar®, Sirius®, Somnia 2 ®, Somno Comfort 2 ®, VENTIclick®, VIVO 30 ®) were measured at three different heating intensities (low, medium, high) and three different flow rates (20, 55 and 90 l/min). The relative humidity at the exit of the tube and {{the temperature of the}} water in the <b>heating</b> chamber were <b>registered.</b> Additionally, we measured the humidity of the oxygen humidifier Respiflo® at 1 - 5 l/min, the Respiflo® was filled with either NaCl 0. 9 % or Aqua dest. Measurements were taken in a climatic chamber at 20 °C and 50 % relative humidity. The atmospheric pressure was taken into consideration. Results: The MR 730 AGM® and Humicare 200 ® generated a constant relative humidity of 100 %. Among the remaining humidifiers, only the HC 602 ®, HumidAire 2 i® and REMstar® reached a humidity of about 95 % at high flow rates. The Minni-Max®, Somnia 2 ® and VIVO 30 generated a humidity of 95 % still at a flow rate of 55 l/min. The Sirius®, Somno Comfort 2 ® and the VENTIclick® generated this amount of humidity only at low flow rates of 20 l/min. The three humidifiers mentioned last generated a relative humidity of only 68 - 76 % at high flow rates of 90 l/min. The Respiflo® generates a humidity of about 90 % at each flow rate (1 - 5 l/min.), independent of being filled with NaCl 0. 9 % or Aqua dest. Conclusion: Factors determinating the efficacy of humidifiers are the velocity of the airstream, the temperature of the water, the contact surface of the air and water compartments and the turbulence of the airstream. In vivo the amount of leakage is a very important determinant for the velocity of the airstream. In the care of mechanically ventilated patients one should have an approximate idea of the magnitude of the applied air flows. The limitations of some humidifiers should be known. The simple presence of a humidifier in combination with a respirator {{does not mean that the}} problem of dryness of the airway mucosa is eliminated...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals to}} the geology and {{petrogenesis}} of the Identidade greenstone belt, located between Xinguara and Rio Maria towns, SE of Pará state. The data {{of this area}} permitted {{the discussion of the}} tectonic evolution of the gravite greenstone terrain of the Rio Maria region {{in the context of the}} Província Mineral de Carajás, SE of the Amazonian craton. The greenstone studied compose a synformal belt in the WNW-ESE direction, corresponding to one metavolcanic pile, formed predominantly by ultramafic schists (UM), basalts (BAS) and gabbros (GB) at the base, and hypabyssal dacitic rocks (DAC - ca. 2. 94 Ga, Pb/Pb) at the top. The whole was intruded by metaplutonic rocks of Mesoarchean ages, the older one being quartz diorites, followed successively by granodiorites, trondhjemites / tonalites and leucogranites. The gneissic basement (GN - outcroping toward north and recognized for having an older fabric Sn- 1 /D 1), the greenstone and the metagranitoids were intruded by hypabyssal rhyolitic (ca. 1. 60 Ga, Rb/Sr) and basic dykes at the end of the Paleoproterozoic. The greenstone presents igneous structures and textures still recognized, although obliterated near the contacts with the metagranitoids and shear zones. The ultramafics occur as tremolitites, tremolite - talc schists and talc schists; the amphibole is very elongated and thin, commonly in parallel arrays, interpreted as ghosts of spinifex textures. The basalts are massive or pillowed and frequently variolitic. They show different degrees of recrystallization, with some relicts of hyalophitic, pilotaxitic and traquitoid textures. Clinoamphibole (actinolitic hornblende), epidotes and plagioclase (albite - andesine) are the most abundant minerais. The gabbros may be massives to porphyritics (plagioclase phenocrysts), still with some relicts of subophitic and granophyric textures. The dacites are porphyritic, with phenocrysts of quartz and plagioclase (oligoclase), besides hornblende and mafic clots (biotite, chlorite, opaque minerais, epidotes, sphene, apatite) in the less evolved samples. Concerning the metagranitoids, the leucogranites and trondhjemites have chloritized biotite, whereas the granodiorites and some tonalites comprise biotite or biotite + hornblende (also in quartz diorites). The greenstone and the metagranitoids were affected by one event of heterogeneous, ductile deformation, that evolved to mylonitic zones. The structural framework of the area is marked by a planar fabric (Sn//Sm/D 2) in the WNW-ESE to E-W direction, with moderate to strong dips in a divergent fan. E-W, WNW-ESE or NW-SE stretching lineations, meso and asymmetric S-C microstructures, mica and clinoamphibole fishes, and rotation of o and i porphyroclasts indicated one megastructure resulting from a binary system with NW-SE shortening direction. The actual geometry of the greenstone would be derived from a dextral transpression, with the greenstone forming a positive flower structure. The transpressional regime favored the grow of transtensional cites and subsequent emplacement of granitic plutons on the NW contact, and extensional crenulation cleavage (Sn+ 1 /D 2) on the SW of the greenstone. Strain measurements displayed a ca. 60 % shortening, subhorizontal extension of ca. 60 to 500 % parallel to the greenstone trend, and vertical extension of ca. 101 to 280 %. The strain ellipsoid may be oblate to prolate, with changes in density and rotation of the axis of maximum stretching (X) toward the mylonitic zones. The inversion of the deformation permitted the reconstruction of the original shape of the greenstone, that would be also elongated WNW-ESE, but with lesser eccentricity than today. These data, together with the quartz petrofabric, suggested that the deformation has been accommodated by pure and simple shear mechanisms, the final framework resulting essentially from the later. The last event (D 3) are represented by faults and fractures which also affected the felsic and basic dykes. The paragenesis of the main metamorphic event (Mn/M 2) is represented by static recrystallization, which modified some textures and almost ali minerais within the greenstone. The minerais formed phases were bluish green amphibole (actinolitic hornblende), epidotes, sphene and quartz in BAS and GB; tremolite, talc and chlorite in UM. The metagranitoids show transformations of plagioclase (saussurite, fine white mica), amphibole (to biotite and/or sphene) and biotite (to chlorite). The coexistence of hornblende + plagioclase (An> 17) and/or actinolitic hornblende + chlorite in metabasic rocks shows that this event was of low pressures and temperatures in the transitional field of the greenschist and amphibolite facies. This episode should reflect a regional crustal heating produced by the plutonism at the end of the Mesoarchean, that obliterated the previous associations of ocean floor metamorphism. Slightly coeval to subsequently, it occurred one event of extensive dynamic recrystallization (Mm/M 2) in the greenschist facies, specially within shear zones and lithological contacts. In these places, there are evidences of fluid incoming (schistose blastomylonites and abundant quartz veins) and remobilization of chemical elements (Al, Fe, Ca, K, Na, Rb, Sr, Zr). Finally, under lower PT conditions, it occurred a less expressive event related to crenulation cleavages and forming chlorite, epidotes and quartz (Mn+ 1 /M 2). The M 2 event, as well as the one detected only in GN (M 1 under amphibolite facies), was of ductile nature and cleary distinguished from the last one (D 3 /M 3). The later was placed at the end of the Paleoproterozoic, being of hydrothermal character and associated to high crustal structures. The progressive evolution of the M 2 metamorphism with its thermal peak predating the deformation suggested a counterclockwise P-T-t path, corresponding to the metamorphic evolution of Phanerozoic marginal basins. Some chemical analysis of the metavolcanic rocks permitted the definition of magmatic series and a discussion of petrogenetical modeling. It was possible to recognize three geochemical series, that is, from the older to the younger, komatiitic (UM), tholeiitic (BAS and GB) and calc-alkaline (DAC). The first one corresponds to peridotitic komatiites with MgO> 18 weight % (volatile-free basis), with an enrichment trend in Al, such as in Geluk and Munro, and less calcic than the Barberton one. The light rare earth element patterns are irregular with (La/Sm) N ratios between 0. 42 and 4. 2 and negative Eu anomalies. The heavy rare earth elements seem less affected by post-eruptive processes, being plate or slightly fractionated (1. 0 quartz>hornblende>K-feldspar, with subordinated amount of biotite, magnetite, sphene, allanite and zircon. The source of the dacitic magma would be a tholeiite metamorphosed to the garnet amphibolite facies and somewhat enriched in light rare earth elements. The geodynamical model proposed admit the existence of a gneissic basement prior to 2. 96 Ga. Between 2. 96 and 2. 90 Ga, the interplay of high geothermal gradients and lithospheric extension was responsible for extensive rifting, forming marginal basin systems, where extruded the komatiitic and tholeiitic rocks. At 2. 94 (?) - 2. 90 Ga, the DAC were generated from partia' melting of oceanic crust in subduction zone settings, and evolved by low pressure fractional crystallization. The same mechanisms that generated the DAC are extended also to the calc-alkaline plutonism, this one being responsible for the structural inversion of the greenstone, crustal thickening and final shape of the granite - greenstone terrain (dextral transpression ca. 2. 88 - 2. 86 Ga). The region still suffered a late episode (end of Eoarchean, 2. 69 - 2. 50 Ga) of (re) <b>heating,</b> <b>registered</b> only in sorne mineral, without any evidente of deformation and/or metamorphism. Finally, it occurred the intrusion of felsic (1. 60 Ga, Rb/r) and basic dykes at the end of the Paleoproterozoic. The correlation with the actual understanding of the Província Mineral de Carajás permitted envisage that the Rio Maria granite - greenstone terrain was then configured at the moment of implantation of the Itacaiúnas Supergroup (ca. 2. 76 Ga) and alkaline granitic plutonism at the Serra dos Carajás. So the sinistrai transpression that inverted that supergroup would correspond to a newer event, very distinct as regards as the dextral transpression of the Rio Maria region.

Os dados obtidos permitiram discutir a evolução geodinâmica do terreno granito - "greenstone" da região de Rio Maria, inserindo-a no contexto da Província Mineral de Carajás (PMC), SE do cráton Amazônico. O "greenstone" em lide compõe um cinturão "sinformal" direcionado WNW-ESE, correspondendo a um pacote metavulcãnico, com xistos ultramáficos (UM), basaltos (BAS) e gabros (GB) na base, e, no topo, rochas hipabissais dacíticas (DAC - ca. 2, 94 Ga, Pb/Pb). O conjunto foi intrudido por metaplutônicas Mesoarqueanas, os tipos mais precoces sendo quartzo dioríticos, seguidos sucessivamente por granodioritos (com enclaves máficos), trondhjemitos / tonalitos e leucogranitos. O embasamento gnáissico (GN - aflorante a norte e reconhecido por conter uma fábrica mais antiga Sn- 1 /D 1), o "greenstone" e os metagranitóides foram intrudidos no final do Paleoproterozôico por enxames de diques riolíticos (ca. 1, 60 Ga, Rb/Sr) e diabásicos. O "greenstone" apresenta estruturas e texturas ígneas reconhecíveis, porém obliteradas em regiões de contato com metagranitóides e em zonas de cisalhamento. As ultramáficas ocorrem como tremolititos, tremolita - talco xistos e talco|$|R
