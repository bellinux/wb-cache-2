Objeto: Este estudio tiene como objetivos de una parte ofrecer elementos para crear un marco de referencia que permita la integración de la gamificación en las políticas de marketing interno y de otra analizar de manera descriptiva varios casos prácticos de empresa en los que se muestra el papel que la gamificación juega al implicar clientes y empleados con estrategias de engagement que influyan en sus comportamientos. Diseño/metodología/enfoque: Partiendo de la orientación al marketing interno, se analizan varios ejemplos de gamificación en empresas y sus antecedentes en los videojuegos. Aportaciones y resultados : La principal aportación es la propuesta de marco conceptual para analizar la gamificación en las estrategias de marketing interno. Implicaciones prácticas: Aplicación de estrategias de gamificación a empresas y organizaciones dirigidas a sus clientes y empleados. Implicaciones sociales: Contribución de las prácticas de gamificación a la satisfacción laboral y al compromiso de los empleados. El marketing interno en la medida en que contribuye a la satisfacción laboral y compromiso de los empleados es un ámbito con potencial para la aplicación de estrategias de gamificación. Originalidad/valor añadido: La gamificación es un fenómeno muy reciente que ha sido objeto de escaso  estudio científico. </p...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the call}} from highly reputable {{research}} organizations for evidence-based educational research, <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> a rater agreement procedure to determine <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> screening procedures employed in a systematic review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> {{has yet to be}} considered by educational researchers. The U. S. Department of Education’s Institute of Education Sciences (IES) has led the effort to critically assess <b>the</b> scientific <b>literature</b> for <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> reporting to stakeholders <b>the</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> educational interventions. Similar to the work conducted by the Cochrane and Campbell Collaboration, the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC), a subdivision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IES, is responsible for conducting and reporting systematic reviews <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> through <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> a protocol published in the What Works Clearinghouse Procedures and Standards Handbook Version 3. 0. (2014). The handbook calls for reporting statistical significance, effect sizes, and an improvement index. However, there is no indication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> agreement, <b>the</b> reliability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature</b> screening procedures, and <b>the</b> review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eligible studies against the WWC standards. To measure <b>the</b> consistency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> appraisal steps in a systematic review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature,</b> this paper proposes <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> measures of inter-rater reliability and inter-rater agreement. Specifically, we explore the conceptual differences between inter-rater reliability and inter-rater agreement metrics, compare <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> several statistical procedures for calculating these metrics and provide examples on how to use these measures as indicators <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evidence presented in a systematic review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>literature...</b>|$|R
