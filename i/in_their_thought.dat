25|$|First-generation Reformed theologians include Huldrych Zwingli (1484–1531), Martin Bucer (1491–1551), Wolfgang Capito (1478–1541), John Oecolampadius (1482–1531), and Guillaume Farel (1489–1565). These reformers {{came from}} diverse {{academic}} backgrounds, but later distinctions within Reformed theology can already be detected <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>thought,</b> especially {{the priority of}} scripture {{as a source of}} authority. Scripture was also viewed as a unified whole, which led to a covenantal theology of the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's Supper as visible signs of the covenant of grace. Another Reformed distinctive present in these theologians was their denial of the bodily presence of Christ in the Lord's supper. Each of these theologians also understood salvation to be by grace alone, and affirmed a doctrine of particular election (the teaching that some people are chosen by God for salvation). Martin Luther and his successor Philipp Melanchthon were undoubtedly significant influences on these theologians, and to a larger extent later Reformed theologians. The doctrine of justification by faith alone was a direct inheritance from Luther.|$|E

[...] Willerslev extends the argument by noting that animists reject this Cartesian dualism, and that the animist self identifies with the world, [...] "feeling at once within and apart from it so that the two glide ceaselessly in and out of each other in a sealed circuit." [...] The animist hunter is thus aware of himself as a human hunter, but, through mimicry is able to assume the viewpoint, senses, and sensibilities of his prey, to be one with it. Shamanism, in this view, is an everyday attempt to influence spirits of ancestors and animals by mirroring their behaviours as the hunter does his prey.|$|E

60|$|There are two {{pictures}} of Venice {{side by side}} in the house where I am writing this, a Canaletto that has little but careful drawing and a not very emotional pleasure in clean bright air, and a Franz Francken, where the blue water, that in the other stirs one so little, can make one long to plunge into the green depth where a cloud shadow falls. Neither painting could move us at all, if our thought did not rush out to the edges of our flesh, and it is so with all good art, whether the Victory of Samothrace which reminds the soles of our feet of swiftness, or the Odyssey that would send us out under the salt wind, or the young horsemen on the Parthenon, that seem happier than our boyhood ever was, and in our boyhood's way. Art bids us touch and taste and hear and see the world, and shrinks from what Blake calls mathematic form, from every abstract thing, from all that is of the brain only, from all that is not a fountain jetting from the entire hopes, memories, and sensations of the body. Its morality is personal, knows little of any general law, has no blame for Little Musgrave, no care for Lord Barnard's house, seems lighter than a breath and yet is hard and heavy, for if a man is not ready to face toil and risk, and in all gaiety of heart, his body will grow unshapely and his heart lack the wild will that stirs desire. It approved before all men those that talked or wrestled or tilted under the walls of Urbino, or sat in the wide window seats discussing all things, with love ever <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>thought,</b> when the wise Duchess ordered all, and the Lady Emilia gave the theme.|$|E

6000|$|As if to mark {{beyond a}} doubt the insignificance {{of the part}} man plays <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>thought,</b> {{sentences}} are usually subjectless. Although {{it is a common}} practice to begin a phrase with the central word of the idea, isolated from what follows by the emphasizing particle [...] "wa" [...] (which means [...] "as to," [...] the French [...] "quant a"), the word thus singled out for distinction is far more likely to be the object of the sentence than its subject. The habit is analogous to the use of our phrase [...] "speaking of,"--that is, simply an emphatic mode of introducing a fresh thought; only that with them, the practice being the rule and not the exception, no correspondingly abrupt effect is produced by it. Ousted thus from the post of honor, the subject is not even permitted the second place. Indeed, it usually fails to put in an appearance anywhere. You may search through sentence after sentence without meeting with the slightest suggestion of such a thing. When so unusual an anomaly as a motive cause is directly adduced, it owes its mention, not to the fact of being the subject, but because for other reasons it happens to be the important word of the thought. The truth is, the Japanese conception of events is only very vaguely subjective. An action is looked upon more as happening than as being performed, as impersonally rather than personally produced. The idea is due, however, to anything but philosophic profundity. It springs from the most superficial of childish conceptions. For the Japanese mind is quite the reverse of abstract. Its consideration of things is concrete to a primitive degree. The language reflects the fact. The few abstract ideas these people now possess are not represented, for the most part, by pure Japanese, but by imported Chinese expressions. The islanders got such general notions from their foreign education, and they imported idea and word at the same time.|$|E

50|$|British idealism was {{influenced}} by Hegel at least in broad outline, and undeniably adopted some of Hegel's terminology and doctrines. Examples include not only the aforementioned Absolute, but also a doctrine of internal relations, a coherence theory of truth, and a concept of a concrete universal.

But few of the British idealists adopted Hegel's philosophy wholesale, and his most significant writings on logic seem to have found no purchase whatsoever <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>thought.</b> On the other hand, Mure was “a deep student of Hegel” who “was committed to Hegel’s ‘central ontological thesis’ all his life.”.|$|E

Once understanding of unfamiliar has been achieved and coherence has been restored, these behaviors and desires will subside.|$|E
5000|$|Postmodern Vertigo is a {{description}} of a panic that occurs when somebody considers the reality of their own existence but no longer accepts truth or structure <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>thought.</b> Suddenly the thinker no longer believes in anything, everything seeming like a fabrication. Thought become meaningless and a feeling akin to vertigo is experienced. Many writers have described this feeling as [...] "the void" [...] or as a [...] "crisis of postmodernism". Another term which has a similar meaning is anomie. Whereas a crisis of postmodernism describes the thought or meaning of viewing existence as a false construct and the void creates a metaphoric representation and Anomie refers to the philosophical dead end, Post-modern vertigo more specifically has been used to refer to this feeling when it takes on a physiological manifestation, causing an increase in heart rate and sweating.|$|E

5000|$|The Ming {{established}} Neo-Confucian interpretations as the orthodoxy {{guidelines and}} created what the historian Benjamin Elman called a [...] "single-minded and monocular political ideology" [...] that [...] "affected politically and socially how literati learning would be interpreted and used." [...] The imperial civil service system adopted this rigid orthodoxy {{at a time}} when commercialization and population growth meant that there was an inflation in the number of degree candidates at the lower levels. As a result, the higher and more prestigious offices were dominated by jinshi [...] (Palace) degree-holders, who tended to come from elite families.
