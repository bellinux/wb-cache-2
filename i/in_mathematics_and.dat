30|$|Compared to {{the above}} {{mentioned}} East Asian countries, the five participating Southeast Asian countries showed a diversity of performance <b>in</b> <b>mathematics,</b> science, <b>and</b> reading literacies in PISA 2012.

In contrast, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand ranked in the bottom third countries participating in PISA 2012. The mean scores of <b>mathematics,</b> science, <b>and</b> reading literacies in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand are relatively lower than the corresponding OECD average in PISA 2012.

The testing of 8th grade <b>in</b> reading <b>and</b> <b>mathematics</b> began <b>in</b> 1999. Testing in science began in 2007. The goal is for 100% of students to be on grade level or better <b>in</b> reading <b>and</b> <b>mathematics,</b> by the Spring of 2014. The tests focus on the state's Academic Standards for reading, writing, <b>mathematics</b> <b>and</b> science. The standards were first published in 1998 and are mandated by the Pennsylvania State Board of Education. Students in 3rd grade are tested <b>in</b> reading <b>and</b> <b>mathematics,</b> fourth graders are tested <b>in</b> reading, <b>mathematics</b> <b>and</b> science.

Thakkar also worked as a voice-over artist for television advertisements. At the same time, Thakkar's interest <b>in</b> <b>mathematics</b> <b>and</b> science remained predominant.

Local officials decided that as a Polish noble he was not entitled to the 10-ruble pension received by most other exiles.|$|E

Royton and Crompton is a coeducational, secondary comprehensive school for 11- to 16-year-olds. It has Science College status and was constructed in 1968. Our Lady's is a coeducational Roman Catholic high school and sixth form college for 11- to 19-year-olds. It was established in 1961 and specialialises <b>in</b> <b>Mathematics</b> <b>and</b> Computing. In the 2000s, Oldham Council and the Diocese of Salford agreed to merge Our Lady's with the St Augustine of Canterbury R.C. High School in Werneth.
