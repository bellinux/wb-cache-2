500|$|Piano Concerto No. 2, Allegro, Opus 102 by Dmitri Shostakovich. Based on {{the fairy}} tale [...] "The Steadfast Tin Soldier" [...] by Hans Christian Andersen, a broken toy soldier with one leg {{falls in love with}} a toy {{ballerina}} and protects her from an evil <b>jack-in-the-box.</b> Unlike the original story, this version has a happy ending. Introduced by Bette Midler featuring pianist Yefim Bronfman.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} segment, Springfield {{is held in}} a grip of terror by Bart, who has omnipotent powers. Bart turns whoever is not happy with his rule into another being, and even history is changed to suit Bart's pleasure. When Homer refuses to turn off a {{football}} game so that Bart can watch [...] "The Krusty the Clown Show" [...] (which has been running for 346 consecutive hours), Bart transports him into the football stadium {{in place of the}} ball for a field goal kick. As Homer creeps back into the house, trying to surprise Bart with a blow {{to the back of the}} head, Bart transforms him into a <b>jack-in-the-box.</b> Marge suggests that the two see Dr. Marvin Monroe. The doctor says that Bart is desperate for paternal attention from Homer and suggests that the two spend more time together. Despite being a <b>jack-in-the-box,</b> Homer spends quality time with Bart, and they soon become a normal, loving family. Bart turns Homer back into a human and the two share a warm family moment, causing Bart to wake up screaming. Bart and Lisa wake Homer and Marge and beg them to let them sleep in their bed. As the two crawl into bed, Homer laments that he has to go to work in a few hours and dozes off, becoming the last one in the episode to have a nightmare.|$|E
500|$|In {{the opening}} scene, the two aliens Kang and Kodos {{introduce}} a variety show, {{with a live}} audience consisting of aliens. While they tell jokes, canned laughter is played, but the audience appears unamused. The Simpson family sits on the couch, with Homer appearing as the <b>jack-in-the-box</b> from [...] "Treehouse of Horror II", Marge as the witch from [...] "Treehouse of Horror VIII", Bart as the half-fly mutant from [...] "Treehouse of Horror VIII". Maggie is the alien/human mutant from [...] "Treehouse of Horror IX" [...] and Lisa {{is the victim of}} an axe murder. Lisa then asks what aliens have to do with Halloween, and Maggie, in Kang's voice, says, [...] "Silence!", and disintegrates her with a ray gun.|$|E
60|$|But Fanny was charming {{all the way}} home. She coaxed, and snuggled, and smiled. She laughed pretty laughs; she admired everything; {{she took}} out the darling little <b>Jack-in-the-boxes,</b> and was so obliged to Sam. And when they got home, and Mr. Huxter, still with {{darkness}} on his countenance, was taking a frigid leave of her--she burst into tears, {{and said he was}} a naughty unkind thing.|$|R
50|$|The Dutch artist Anton Pieck (1895-1987) has an {{illustration}} of a street corner scene, in which a sandwich man advertises a performance of Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor at the Opera by Christine Nilsson. At the corner, by {{the sign of the}} Old Queen's Head Inn, stands a man selling <b>jack-in-the-boxes.</b> At the center of the scene, which presumably takes place in England perhaps London, circa 1890, we see a man pedaling a penny-farthing.|$|R
5000|$|Before taping began, {{production}} staff gave ten female {{members of}} the studio audience small gift boxes. Three of these boxes contained cards with the numbers 1, 2, and 3 inside them. As Edwards instructed them to open their boxes, the three contestants with numbers {{came down to the}} table {{at the center of the}} stage. These three women then picked one of three <b>jack-in-the-boxes,</b> with the contestant with the number 1 getting first choice, and so on. The contestant who chose the pop-up surprise (e.g., flowers, dolls) earned the right to go on the treasure hunt.|$|R
500|$|... "Treehouse of Horror II" [...] is {{the seventh}} episode of The Simpsons third season. It first aired on the Fox {{network in the}} United States on October 31, 1991. It is the second annual Treehouse of Horror episode, {{consisting}} of three self-contained segments, told as dreams of Lisa, Bart and Homer. In the first segment, which was inspired by W. W. Jacobs's short story The Monkey's Paw and The New Twilight Zone episode [...] "A Small Talent for War", Homer buys a Monkey's Paw that {{has the power to}} grant wishes, although all of the wishes backfire. In the second part, which parodies the Twilight Zone episode [...] "It's a Good Life", Bart is omnipotent, and turns Homer into a <b>jack-in-the-box,</b> resulting in the two spending more time together. In the final segment, Mr. Burns attempts to use Homer's brain to power a giant robotic laborer.|$|E
2500|$|Alexander Leathes Donaldson was {{admitted}} an Attorney at Westminster in 1865, {{and to the}} local Bar in 1873; John Burkinshaw {{was admitted}} an Attorney at Westminster in 1863, and to the local Bar in 1874. When Mr. Bond retired his place on the Legislative Council was given to Mr. Burkinshaw; in 1893 it went to Mr. Donaldson, in 1896 back to Mr. Burkinshaw, Mr. Donaldson having retired in 1895. Mr. Burkinshaw continued to be on Council until 1902, when he retired….These two gentlemen built up the leading European practice of their day, and their <b>jack-in-the-box</b> possession of {{a seat on the}} Legislative Council undoubtedly gave the Firm great influence. Both of them were sound legislators, displaying force and wisdom in their speeches, and being of undoubted assistance to the deliberations of the Council.” ...|$|E
2500|$|When the Care Bears {{come to the}} rat, {{he reveals}} his real name and homelandBasil Ratbone, from the No Fun Atoll, whose {{inhabitants}} have lived through a [...] "serious" [...] modus operandi. [...] He wanted the jewels so much to enliven his fellow residents that he planned on stealing them from Joke-a-lot, and even pretended that Funshine's [...] "tummy symbol" [...] was the royal birthmark. [...] Instead, the real onea [...] "smiley mouth"was {{at the back of}} Gig's ears. [...] The other Bears open the chest to find a <b>jack-in-the-box,</b> and other toys, which Funshine assures them are the real magic jewels. Funnybone apologizes for his misdeeds, and soon all of Joke-a-lot attends a coronation in which Gig becomes their Princess (though she is really more like a Queen). The Bears promise to return to Joke-a-lot some other day and ride home on the flying horses from their carousel.|$|E
5000|$|Toychestra {{played at}} a variety of venues, from {{experimental}} music spaces and rock clubs, to schools and community centers. They arranged and performed [...] "symphonic miniatures" [...] using toy musical instruments, including tiny pianos, recorders, bugles, drum sets and xylophones, plus other noise making toys, like pink zoo trains and <b>jack-in-the-boxes.</b> They also used a variety of found objects for percussive sounds. Contact microphones were attached to each [...] "instrument" [...] for amplification and the feeds were mixed live during their performances. They dressed up in [...] "dime-store costumes: bridal gowns, superhero outfits, and cowgirl regalia" [...] with [...] "future-shock hairdos and fluorescent wigs". The San Francisco Bay Guardian described Toychestra as an [...] "ongoing experiment in naïve sound." ...|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} element of Hyde and Closer, cursed dolls are a form of magic created when a magic talisman is placed inside an inanimate object, which brings it to life. The doll possesses its own personality and follows the commands and instructions of its master. A cursed doll is powered by the magic given to it by its master and can even perform magic all by itself. Dolls also grow weaker the farther they are from their master; thus dolls that are close to their masters are far stronger. When a curse doll is destroyed, its creator suffers backlash that takes various forms (one magician was killed by bad luck, another suddenly suffered appendicitis). Despite what the name implies, cursed dolls {{do not have to}} strictly be dolls, as there have been stuffed animals, <b>jack-in-the-boxes,</b> and shadow puppets.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Jack-in-the-Box's</b> basic arsenal {{consists}} of his [...] "footapaults", [...] "handsprings", entangling streamers and [...] "electro-noses". His footapaults are telescoping boots capable of catapulting {{him into the}} air and leaping him rapidly through and over a variety of terrains and urban environments. (Sometimes, covers will show them also acting as stilts, while the actual stories only portray them as being used to make leaps.) Similarly, his handsprings are telescoping gloves which extend his reach and grip (and punch). He can also project from them a multicolored plastic solution which solidifies on contact with the air into streamers, and can be used to impede and ensnare his foes, much like the web-fluid of [...] Marvel's Spider-Man. His [...] "electro-noses" [...] are rubber clown noses which, when deftly applied to an opponent's face, delivers a jolt from a built-in electroshock weapon, knocking the recipient unconscious.|$|R
2500|$|The third Joker's Card, the Riddle Box (1995), {{is another}} entity used to {{determine}} fate. Upon death, a soul enters a dark chamber containing a <b>jack-in-the-box</b> on an old wooden table. The front of the box has a [...] "painted question mark faded with time," [...] representing the mystery of your own afterlife. As the handle is turned, a melodic tune begins to play. When the music stops, the decision is revealed. The pure see a vision of God, warming their souls as they enter eternal peace. The wicked see an immense fog seeping from the box, [...] "stripping their sanity, as they witness an image of hell, spawned and formed from their own evil; a hideous reflection of their demented souls." [...] The floor falls from underneath them, casting the doomed into the bottomless pit of hell. The fate revealed by the Riddle Box can be found by looking deep within yourself and can be changed with righteous actions.|$|E
2500|$|William Bell Scott has {{an anecdote}} of Burchett, who [...] "had chosen {{the subject as}} a glorious example {{of the power of}} the Church and the faith of the prince at that blessed period in Merry England" [...] failing to sell the {{painting}} to an [...] "extreme Radical" [...] shipping magnate: [...] ""I admire the picture, Mr. Burchett, it is excellently painted, and I like it for its subject these men in full armour won't go in, they won't end the day completely after risking all their lives, because of that old priest with the <b>jack-in-the-box!</b> Superstition, you see, turns them into caitiffs!" [...] This knocked over poor Burchett so much, the transaction came to nothing" [...] Scott comments that Burchett: [...] "gave himself up to historical painting on a rather large scale, just the kind of art which English taste and the R. Academy as the mediocre exponent of the same would like to crush out of existence".|$|E

5000|$|During the [...] "Dark Age" [...] arc of Astro City, it was {{revealed}} that one of the original <b>Jack-in-the-Box's</b> enemies had somehow acquired blood samples of him, and at one point attempted to grow a clone, hoping to create the perfect henchman. Instead, the result was Gloo, a green, amorphous blob with vesitigal heads/limbs. Possessing a twisted sentience and memories of being a hero, Gloo was feared by criminals as an unstoppable killing machine, attacking anyone it could discern as an armed and dangerous threat. Gloo would often use powers and tactics which morbidly copied old comedy tropes, such as exhaling acid onto his victims much like a slapstick comedian would spray people with a seltzer bottle, or crush gangs together to fit them into a compact car, forming a gruesome clown car. Gloo was operating up until 1984 at least, but when, how, or even if Gloo was destroyed, or if Zachary Johnson ever encountered it, has not yet been shown in the series.|$|R
5000|$|The story {{takes place}} in a land ruled by and {{intended}} for young characters, the Ketchup Kingdom, which is also filled with devices like <b>Jack-in-the-Boxes.</b> The protagonist is a hare-like boy in blue clothing name DeMille, who lives in a school bus with no wheels in a village {{on the outskirts of the}} Ketchup Kingdom called Cobore Village. DeMille is an outcast because he dislikes tomatoes. As a result, he and other kids in Kobora who dislike tomatoes are looked down upon as [...] "Droppers", banished for heresy, and locked up in Cobore Village until they change their attitudes towards tomatoes. While watching television, DeMille sees that the main antagonist, King Abīra, is celebrating a holiday called Tomato Day, while showing his project he created called the Super Cara-Cooker, a laser-like gun that transforms people, places, and things into dolls, toys, and playgrounds. After DeMille's television set gets severely damaged, he visits his neighbor and friend Seremo and asks him if he could fix his television set. Seremo says he will and gives DeMille his first Gimmick, called the Gear Yo-Yo.|$|R

5000|$|Krusty {{has been}} {{included}} in many Simpsons publications, toys and other merchandise. Krusty-themed merchandise includes dolls, posters, figurines, <b>Jack-in-the-boxes,</b> Pint glasses, bobblehead dolls, costumes, and clothing such as T-shirts. Playmates Toys has made a talking evil Krusty doll, based on the one that appeared in [...] "Treehouse of Horror III". In 1992, Acclaim Entertainment released the video game Krusty's Fun House for PC and home consoles. Krusty was made into an action figure, and several different versions were included {{as part of the}} World of Springfield toy line. The first, which shows Krusty in his normal clown attire with several Krusty products, was released in 2000 as part of [...] "wave one". The second, released in 2002 as part of [...] "wave nine", is called [...] "busted Krusty" [...] and shows him in a prison and without his clown makeup, as he was seen in [...] "Krusty Gets Busted". The third was released in 2003 as part of [...] "wave thirteen" [...] and was called [...] "Tuxedo Krusty". Several Krusty themed play sets were also released, including a Krusty-Lu Studios and Krusty Burger playset, both released in 2001.|$|R
500|$|The Joker has no {{inherent}} superhuman abilities. He commits crimes with {{a variety}} of weaponized thematic props such as a deck of razor-tipped playing cards, rolling marbles, <b>Jack-in-the-boxes</b> with unpleasant surprises and exploding cigars capable of leveling a building. The flower in his lapel sprays acid, and his hand often holds a lethal joy buzzer conducting a million volts of electricity, although both items were introduced in 1952 as harmless joke items. However, his chemical genius provides his most-notable weapon: Joker venom, a liquid or gaseous toxin which sends its targets into fits of uncontrollable laughter; higher doses can lead to paralysis, coma or death, leaving its victim with a ghoulish, pained rictus grin. The Joker has used venom since his debut; only he knows the formula, and is shown to be gifted enough to manufacture the toxin from ordinary household chemicals. Another version of the venom (used in [...] "Joker's Last Laugh") makes its victims resemble the Joker, susceptible to his orders. The villain is immune to venom and most poisons; in Batman #663 (2007), Morrison writes that being [...] "an avid consumer of his own chemical experiments, the Joker's immunity to poison concoctions that might kill another man in an instant has been developed over years of dedicated abuse." ...|$|R

The Baron wants Chitty Chitty Bang Bang for his own, and kidnapped Caractacus' father under the mistaken impression {{that he is the}} one who created the unusual car. The airship is returning to Vulgaria with Grandpa Potts, where the Baron plans to hold him hostage until he can make a new car for the Baron. Truly suggests informing the British government that the rival country has kidnapped a British citizen, but Caractacus wants to save his father so instead they pursue the blimp. Eventually they find the blimp, but see that Baron Bomburst has spotted them with his country government staff and thus they are forced to hide in the nearby village as the Baron releases his army to search for the car. A friendly local Toymaker hides them and informs them that children are forbidden in the country by the Baron's wife, Baroness Bomburst. When a military patrol tries to search the toymaker's shop, the family disguise themselves as life sized <b>Jack-in-the-Boxes,</b> which the toymaker has made for the Baron. Fortunately the soldiers fall for the trick and leave, however the group hear that the soldiers have found Chitty and have taken it to the Baron.|$|R

Jack rescues Santa from a train-contraption by {{changing}} the tracks, but Oogie, having become enraged by Jack constantly foiling his plots, leaves in Santa's sleigh full of Christmas presents. Luckily, Sally brings Jack's sleigh to help, and Jack and Santa chase after Oogie. Oogie falls out of the Christmas sleigh {{into a world of}} garbage after being frightened by one of Jack's <b>jack-in-the-boxes</b> that was dropped in the sleigh by an elf. There, he absorbs the waste and insects in the environment and becomes a giant version of himself made of sewn together garbage known as [...] "Mega-Oogie" [...] to beat Jack.

Oogie spills out his bugs, becoming nothing more than an empty husk, and ending his threat. Afterward, Jack apologizes to Santa for almost ruining Christmas again, but having a change of heart about the skeleton, Santa thanks him for saving his life.|$|R
50|$|They are {{commonly}} found in deciduous forests in between Minnesota, Rhode Island, and Ontario and south to Kentucky, and are easily recognizable by their large, white, overlapping mandibles. The adult is 12 - 14 mm (1/2-5/8") in length, and has fairly long legs. The mandibles give these attractive insects a ferocious appearance. While tiger beetles are voracious predators of small arthropods, they do not bite humans unless handled, and their bite is such a mild pinch that it is barely noticeable. Both the common name and the species name refer to the six small white spots on the beetle's metallic-green to metallic-blue-green elytra. This {{is not always the}} case, however, as some individuals may have more spots, fewer spots, or none at all, presumably due to genetic variation. This species is associated with wooded areas and they are often found in sunlit patches clear of undergrowth such as dirt paths and fallen logs where they hunt caterpillars, ants, spiders, and many other kinds of arthropods. Although tiger beetles are not gregarious, many beetles may sometimes be seen in one suitable hunting area. The female lays her eggs in sandy patches, and the larvae burrow into the ground after they hatch. Here they lie in wait until small arthropods pass by, at which time the larvae lunge out of their burrows at their prey like <b>jack-in-the-boxes.</b> The beetles develop as larvae for about one year before pupating, and the insect has a total lifespan of just under 5 years.|$|R

He had fired astonishing volleys of what is called [...] "chaff" [...] into endless windows as he passed; into lines of grinning girls' schools; into little regiments of shouting urchins hurraying behind the railings of their Classical and Commercial Academies; into casements whence smiling maid-servants, and nurses tossing babies, or demure old maiden ladies with dissenting countenances, were looking. And the pretty girl in the straw bonnet with pink ribbon, and her mamma the devourer of lobsters, had both agreed that when he was in [...] "spirits" [...] there was nothing like that Mr. Sam. He had crammed the cab with trophies won from the bankrupt proprietors of the Sticks hard by, and with countless pincushions, wooden apples, backy-boxes, <b>Jack-in-the-boxes,</b> and little soldiers.
