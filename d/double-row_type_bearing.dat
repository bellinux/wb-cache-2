40|$|Centrifugal pump {{performance}} characteristics are vital {{in determining the}} ability of a prototype left ventricular assist device (LVAD) to meet the physiological circulation requirements of the cardiovascular system. These characteristics influence the static hydraulic forces encountered by the pump impeller, which determine the required load stiffness of suspension <b>type</b> <b>bearings</b> to minimize impeller touchdown. Performance investigations were conducted on an LVAD design while characterizing the impeller static hydraulic forces of various impeller/volute configurations. The pumps were inserted into a complete systemic and pulmonary mock circulation rig configured to provide suitable nonpulsatile or simulated pulsatile left heart failure environments. The single volute and closed shroud impeller configuration exhibited lowest radial (0. 01 N) and axial (3 N) force at nonpulsatile design flow conditions, respectively. Normal hemodynamic conditions of 5. 1 L/min at 94 mmHg were re-established upon inserting the device into the left heart failure environment, where the pump operated along the nonpulsatile characteristic curve for 2200 rpm. The operational limits on this curve were dictated by the required pressure differential across the pump during systolic and diastolic periods. The reduction of left atrial pressure (25 to 8 mmHg) indicated the alleviation of pulmonary congestion. The ability for the LVAD to support circulation in a left heart failure environment was successfully demonstrated in the mock circulation loop. The impeller hydraulic force characteristics attained will aid the bearing designer to select the best volute and impeller configuration to minimize impeller touchdown in magnetic, hydrodynamic or mechanical <b>type</b> <b>bearing</b> applications...|$|R
