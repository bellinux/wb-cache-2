40|$|Abstract — Unlike statically stable wheeled mobile robots, {{dynamically}} stable mobile robots {{can have}} higher centers of gravity, smaller bases {{of support and}} can be tall and thin resembling {{the shape of an}} adult human. This paper concerns the ballbot mobile robot, which balances dynamically on a single spherical wheel. The ballbot is omni-directional and can also rotate about its vertical axis (yaw motion). It uses a triad of legs to remain statically stable when powered off. This paper presents the evolved design with a four-motor inverse mouseball drive, yaw drive, leg drive, control system, and results including <b>dynamic</b> balancing, <b>station</b> <b>keeping,</b> yaw motion while balancing, and automatic transition between statically stable and dynamically stable states.

40|$|We {{postulate}} that multi-wheel statically-stable mobile robots {{for operation}} in human environments are an evolutionarydead end. Robots of this class {{tall enough to}} interact meaningfully with people must have low centers of gravity, overly wide bases of support, and very low accelerations to avoid tipping over. Accordingly, we are developing an inverse {{of this type of}} mobile robot that is the height, width, and weight of a person, having a high center of gravity, that balances dynamically on a single spherical wheel. Unlike balancing 2 -wheel platforms which must turn before driving in some direction, the single-wheel robot can move directly in any direction. We present the overall design, actuator mechanism based on an inverse mouse-ball drive, control system, and initial results including <b>dynamic</b> balancing, <b>station</b> <b>keeping,</b> and point-to-point motion. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} most recently {{updated version of}} a computer program which simulates the motion of a geostationary satellite influenced by perturbations and controlled by maneuvers according to certain <b>station</b> <b>keeping</b> strategies. The program allows the consideration of constraints imposed by the satellite configuration and errors of orbit determination and thrust execution. In the present form, 4 <b>station</b> <b>keeping</b> strategies are implemented. They can be replaced by alternative strategies by slight program modifications. Using simplified models for the orbit and the maneuvers, the running times are short so as to allow repeated simulations of several years of <b>station</b> <b>keeping</b> {{within a few minutes}} of computer time. The program is designed to optimize certain <b>station</b> <b>keeping</b> strategy parameters by iterative application of the simulation.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{characteristics}} thrust is introduced herein {{as a means}} of classifying propulsion system tasks related particularly to geosynchronous communications spacecraft. Approximate analytical models are developed to permit estimation of characteristic thrust for injection error corrections, orbit angle re-location, north-south <b>station</b> <b>keeping,</b> east-west <b>station</b> <b>keeping,</b> spin axis precession control, attitude rate damping, and orbit raising applications. Performance assessment factors are then outlined in terms of characteristic power, characteristic weight, and characteristic volume envelope, which are related to the characteristic thrust. Finally, selected performance curves are shown for power as a function of spacecraft weight, including the influence of duty cycle on north-south <b>station</b> <b>keeping,</b> a 90 degree orbit angle re-location in 14 days, and finally comparison of orbit raising tasks from low and intermediate orbits to a final geosynchronous station.

The use of electric thrusters imposes {{to take into account}} some additional non linear constraints that make the overall <b>station</b> <b>keeping</b> optimal control problem difficult to solve directly. That is why we choose here to decompose the <b>station</b> <b>keeping</b> problem in two control problems. The first one consists in solving a classical optimal control problem with an indirect method initialized by a direct method without using the thrusters operational constraints. The second problem deals with the thrusters operating constraints, that are taken into account by two different ways.

40|$|A {{simple and}} {{effective}} mathematical method to calculate optimal station-keeping manoeuvres {{by means of}} electric propulsion is suggested. The method {{is based on a}} linearization of the satellite motion near a reference orbit. Two versions of the method allow <b>station</b> <b>keeping</b> both in an assigned position and in any position of the orbit. The method is fully analytical for the two-body problem and takes a simpler form for the circular assigned orbit. The suggested method may also be used in the case when constraints are imposed on the thrust direction due to specific features of the satellite stabilization mode. An application of the method to any force field is shown. Illustrative examples of satellite <b>station</b> <b>keeping</b> in a circular orbit are given.

40|$|The ISEE-C {{spacecraft}} {{must be kept}} {{close to}} an unstable 'halo' orbit {{with a series of}} discrete orbital maneuvers set at intervals at least one month apart. A numerical algorithm has been developed to compute a velocity correction at any point on the trajectory which will minimize the distance between the satellite orbit and the nominal halo path. This algorithm is used to generate a number of <b>station</b> <b>keeping</b> histories with fixed time intervals between maneuvers to ascertain bounds on fuel cost, tightness of fit to nominal path and expected duration between thrust applications. The difference between a third order analytic representation of the halo orbit and a numerically improved nominal path as a reference orbit in the <b>station</b> <b>keeping</b> scheme is investigated as well as the distinction between a tight control and a loose control. A simulation of an operational approach to <b>station</b> <b>keeping</b> is also presented which shows that intermittant propulsive maneuvers can be used to control the spacecraft with very modest fuel expenditure...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{attitude}} acquisition and control for the Italian Scientific Microsatellite for Advanced Research and Technology. Since the microsatellite is aimed at remote sensing applications, three-axis fine attitude control (0. 1 °- 0. 01 °) during <b>station</b> <b>keeping</b> is required. The attitude acquisition technique exploits the magnetic control to despin the microsatellite initial tumbling and uses a small reaction wheel to despin the microsatellite residual rotation around the axis perpendicular to the orbit plane, due to the magnetic control. Three-axis attitude control during <b>station</b> <b>keeping</b> is performed by means of three small reaction wheels, whose reaction torque vector is computed using Proportional Derivative control laws and optimum control theory. Coarse attitude control is first performed in which the microsatellite attitude angles are determined by a technique based {{on the use of}} sensors with low mass and power consumption. Fine attitude control is then achieved by using a small star tracker for fine attitude measurement. The proposed techniques for attitude acquisition, determination and control during <b>station</b> <b>keeping</b> are numerically tested with a code that simultaneously integrates the microsatellite attitude dynamics and control. Numerical results show that the attitude acquisition is performed in about 20 orbits, after the separation from the launcher, while coarse attitude determination and control during <b>station</b> <b>keeping</b> are achieved with accuracies 0. 7 ° and ± 2 °, respectively...|$|R
