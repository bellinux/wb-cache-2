He said {{he was willing to}} accept the cession of the Sudetenland to Germany. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> by Hitler's response: Hitler said that cession of the Sudetenland was not enough and that Czechoslovakia (which he had {{described}} as a [...] "fraudulent state") must be broken up completely. Later in the day, Hitler resiled, saying {{that he was willing to}} accept the cession of the Sudetenland by 1 October. On 24 September, Germany issued the Godesberg Memorandum, demanding cession by 28 September, or war. The Czechs rejected these demands, France ordered mobilization and Britain mobilized its Navy.|$|E

The bridge is {{mentioned in the}} records of the Great Sheffield Flood of 1864 as follows: [...] "The watchman on duty near Brightside Bridge had a very narrow escape. When passing the bridge <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> by a singular sound as though the steam from a distant engine had suddenly been let off, and immediately after the flood came rushing down. The water rose rapidly over the bridge and the road. To escape he mounted the wall, intending to walk along it to some place of safety; but in another moment he felt the wall tremble beneath him. He then jumped off it, and rushed through the waters nearly breast high towards the Midland railway, which he succeeded in reaching, and down which he walked to Sheffield".|$|E

2500|$|The light {{infantry}} rallied on the 5th Foot and 55th Foot, but {{the three}} British units were soon forced to withdraw. When the British army commander General Sir William Howe {{appeared on the scene}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>startled</b> to see his crack light infantry fleeing before the American advance. He yelled, [...] "For shame, Light Infantry! I never saw you retreat before. Form! Form! It is only a scouting party". After nearly being cut down by a blast of grape shot, Howe and his staff quickly rode off. The 2nd Pennsylvania Brigade soon struck a picket of the 46th Foot and swept it before them. Soon Wayne's men became anxious because fighting at the Chew House erupted several hundred yards in their rear. Isolated in the fog, Wayne ordered an about-face and his two brigades began to move back toward the noise of battle. The 2nd Brigade, now on the division's right, blundered into part of Major General Adam Stephen's division moving forward. In a tragic friendly fire incident, Stephen's men opened fire and the Pennsylvanians returned fire. Wayne's soldiers, fired on by their friends and confused by the fog, panicked and took to their heels. They finally rallied [...] from the battlefield.|$|E
