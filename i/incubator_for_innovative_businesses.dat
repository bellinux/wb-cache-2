40|$|This study investigates major {{features}} of land-use strategies that German municipalities have adopted to attract innovative firms (IFs). In this context a two-stage competition model is introduced: firstly a municipality should solve economic and interest conflicts {{related to its}} preference for high-quality sites for IFs against the land needs of simple manufacturers. The {{second part of the}} model describes location competition among municipalities with high-quality sites for the location of IFs. German municipal land-use policy is well combined with industrial policy; this paper reveals {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the urban real estate market in Potsdam, and its future opportunities and risks as the location of different economic activities are determined in the planning process. Science Park Adlershof (Berlin) is an output of the spatial-oriented technology policy, which creates <b>incubators</b> <b>for</b> <b>innovative</b> SMEs. Municipalities also cooperate, since it provides larger sites, generates economies of scale and contributes to a smooth suburbanisation process (see Leipzig).

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{identification}} of interorganisational drivers for biomass valorisation that create relational rents. Given the growing interest in the valorisation of biowastes it is posited that entrepreneurial firms develop interorganisational relationships to generate competitive advantages. The literature study of transaction cost theory, resource-based theory, and network theory brought about four plausible drivers <b>for</b> <b>innovative</b> <b>business</b> development in biomass valorisation. The newness of research on biomass valorisation, scarcity of good data and confidentiality issues made explorative research necessary, and therefore the case study method was applied on six focal firms in the Netherlands. The results confirm the relevancy of three out of the four suggested drivers for biomass valorisation that create relational rents, namely: complementary resources, partner alignment and relationship governance...|$|R

Making a small and medium enterprise successful must be considered as an invention-innovation-diffusion process that tackles both the businesses mix of the given size, and the small and medium enterprise as an entrepreneurial achievement. Thus, all preconditions concerning both the content and the process of innovation must be considered, which requires the requisite holism and, therefore, systemic rather than one-sided thinking/behavior of the usual specialists. Hence, values/culture/ethics/norms of owners, entrepreneurs, managers and their co-workers must also be innovated along with their knowledge.
