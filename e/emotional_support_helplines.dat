40|$|Abstract Maternal <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> {{plays a role}} in the {{outcomes}} of peer victimization. Results however, have been inconsistent. The present study investigated whether maternal <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> moderated the relationship between relational victimization by peers and internalizing problems in adolescents. The sample included 400 adolescents between 12 and 16 years of age and their mothers. Relational victimization was used as a predictor for anxiety and depression with maternal <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> as a moderator in the regression analyses. A positive relationship between relational victimization and internalizing problems was found. A significant interaction effect was found for maternal <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> in the relationship between relational victimization and anxiety. For adolescents who had low levels of maternal <b>emotional</b> <b>support,</b> the association between relational victimization and anxiety was negative for adolescents who were highly victimized and positive for adolescents who were only slightly victimized. The analyses were replicated separately for boys and girls. The same results were found for girls but not for boys. The moderating effect of maternal <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> on the relationship between relational victimization and depression was not found. However, a main effect of maternal <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> on relational victimization for boys was found. More maternal <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> predicted more depressive symptoms for boys. The findings contradict previous studies that emphasize the protective role of <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> on internalizing problems. Future studies should use a longitudinal design and should further investigate which specific aspects of maternal <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> predict internalizing problems due to victimization...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{investigates the}} impact on {{different}} postpartum depressive trajectories (i. e., "non depressive symptoms", "stable depressive symptoms", "deterioration" and "improvement") from 5 - 17 months after childbirth exerted by <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> that mothers receive from their partners and <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> they provide to their partners. METHODS: Postpartum depressive symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale 5 and 17 months after delivery {{in a sample of}} 293 mothers. <b>Emotional</b> <b>support</b> received from the partners was assessed among both mothers and partners. RESULTS: The initial level and the change in <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> that mothers received from their partners were related to different trajectories of postpartum depressive symptoms. Mothers who were living in a partnership with low reciprocal <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> showed a significantly higher risk of suffering from "stable depressive symptoms" than mothers who were living in a partnership with high reciprocal <b>emotional</b> <b>support.</b> CONCLUSIONS: An increased risk of persistent depressive symptoms beyond the early postpartum period was observed in mothers with poor reciprocal <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> in the partnership. Further research is needed for {{a better understanding of the}} mothers persistent depressive symptoms after childbirth associated with reciprocity of <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> in the partnership...|$|R
40|$|Anxiety and {{depression}} in cancer patients are common psychological disorders in cancer patients. Research showed that higher psychological resilience contributes to lower anxiety {{and depression}} in cancer patients. Discussions with doctors about <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> was also found to reduce symptom severity of {{anxiety and depression}} in cancer patients, however, the mechanisms of how such provision helped cancer patients were unclear. The current study aimed to replicate the findings that psychological resilience and information about <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> would lessen anxiety and depression severity. This study also investigated how psychological resilience and information about <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> may interact to predict anxiety and depression in cancer patients. Qualitative interviews were carried out to investigate important aspects of discussions with doctors about <b>emotional</b> <b>support.</b> Higher psychological resilience was found to predict lower anxiety and depression in cancer patients. No effects of information about <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> and interaction between <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> information and psychological resilience were found in predicting anxiety and depression in cancer patients. Qualitative interviews revealed that <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> information provision served as <b>emotional</b> <b>support,</b> such information could provide patients with sources for support, the information should be in written and verbal forms and provided immediately after cancer diagnoses, and that individual differences {{should be considered in}} <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> information provision.

40|$|Background: Receiving <b>{{emotional}}</b> <b>support</b> from {{a romantic}} partner {{often leads to}} emotional costs via negative appraisals about the self and one’s relationship, but {{it is unclear whether}} certain individuals are more susceptible to these costs. We evaluate whether the presence of perfectionistic and dependent dysfunctional attitudes leads to more negative effects of receiving <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> from a romantic partner. Methods: Twenty-nine couples (27 men, 31 women; mean age 24. 5) completed the Dysfunctional Attitudes Scale and then a daily online questionnaire by recording their mood, appraisals, and received <b>emotional</b> <b>support.</b> Mixed-effects regressions were used to evaluate whether perfectionistic and dependent dysfunctional attitudes moderated the relationship between <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> receipt and subsequent mood and appraisals. Results: Perfectionism did not interact with <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> but exerted a main effect of increasing negative moods and appraisals. Dependency interacted with <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> such that those with more dependent attitudes, reported greater negative next-day moods and appraisals as a function of <b>emotional</b> <b>support.</b> Conclusions: Individuals with dependent, but not perfectionistic, dysfunctional attitudes are more likely to experience emotional and cognitive costs after receiving <b>emotional</b> <b>support.</b> These costs may stem from activation or exacerbation of the attitudes specific to dependency, including need for acceptance, support, and approval of others...|$|R

In addition, classroom <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> moderated the relation between children’s attention and reading and mathematics achievement, such that attention mattered most for reading and mathematics achievement for children in classrooms with lower <b>emotional</b> <b>support.</b> Findings point to the importance of understanding how children’s temperament and classroom <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> may work together to promote or inhibit children’s academic achievement...|$|R
40|$|This {{qualitative}} study explores characteristics of repatriates’ <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> providers. Although most scholars {{agree on the}} importance of support for ex/repatriates’ well-being, the sources of repatriates’ <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> – that is, their <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> network – remain largely unexplored. Analyses of 27 semi-structured in-depth interviews with organizational repatriates suggest that expat/adjustment empathy is a key attribute of organizational repatriates’ main <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> providers. Analyses suggest that not only people who went abroad themselves are perceived as ‘expat-emphatic’ but also people who came to visit or people that are considering going abroad themselves. Next to this, results show that although partners are a main source of <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> upon re-entry, they are at the same time important causes of distress as well. Finally, the results suggest that the cultural diversity of repatriates’ <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> network is linked with characteristics of the assignment and that it impacts their re-entry experiences. This study adds to the understanding of repatriates’ <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> networks generally and contributes to the IHRM literature by developing practical implications based on these new insights –such as, the possible benefits of spouse management or encouraging expatriates to invite home country friends when living abroad...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has found mixed results in terms of {{gender differences in the}} provision of <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> to a relationship partner. Some studies support the popular stereotype that women are more emotionally supportive than men, while others find no gender differences in the amount of <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> men and women provide to one another in a romantic relationship. These conflicting findings {{may be the result of}} shifting standards for men and women in terms of the amount of <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> that is expected to be provided by each within a relationship. Since women are stereotypically assumed to be more nurturing and emotionally supportive than men, more <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> will be expected of them in comparison with men who are assumed to be unemotional and largely unsupportive of their partners. Therefore, women will be held to a higher standard than men with regard to the provision of <b>emotional</b> <b>support.</b> The purpose of the current study was to test this shifting standards effect as it relates to the provision of <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> within dating relationships. Heterosexual male and female undergraduates currently involved in a dating relationship were asked to rate their partners’ provision of <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> using either an objective scale or a subjective scale. It was predicted that objective ratings of <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> provision would reflect stereotypical gender differences with women being rated as providing more support than men. However, subjective ratings, which are subject to shifting standards, would not display gender differences in the provision of <b>emotional</b> <b>support.</b> These results were predicted to be associated with within-gender social comparison and adherence to gender stereotypes. Contrary to predictions, women rated their partners as providing significantly more <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> than men on both the objective and subjective scales. Despite this fact, analyses of items measuring within-gender and between-gender comparisons revealed that participants adhered to the stereotype that women typically provide more <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> than men. Ratings of <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> provision were related to adherence to benevolent stereotypes about men and women, especially for men. The implications of these surprising results and suggestions for future research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} was to study the role of <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> in <b>emotional</b> well-being (positive affect, negative affect, and non-clinical depressive symptoms). The research literature on social support has primarily focused on support processes occurring {{in the context of}} negative experiences and often has not included positive social interactions. This dissertation aimed to expand the study of <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> by investigating <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> for both positive and negative experiences, as well as emotional invalidation of negative experiences. Also, the mechanisms linking social support with well-being remain largely unclear. Two studies in this dissertation explored the role of emotion regulation self-efficacy as a mediator of the links between perceived emotional support/invalidation and emotional well-being. Moreover, past research on the link between received support and well-being has shown mixed findings. This dissertation aimed to expand this research by investigating the roles of various aspects of received <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> in the prediction of daily affect. Furthermore, this dissertation examined the link between perceived and received <b>emotional</b> <b>support.</b> To this end, three studies were conducted: a concurrent study, a longitudinal study, and a daily diary study. All studies examined <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> {{from the perspective of the}} recipient of support, guided by the theory of perceived partner responsiveness. Findings showed that 1) higher levels of perceived <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> and lower levels of perceived emotional invalidation are associated with enhanced emotional well-being; 2) the link between perceived <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> for negative experiences and depressive symptoms is bidirectional; 3) emotion regulation self-efficacy (especially perceived ability to regulate negative emotions) mediates the link between perceived emotional support/invalidation and emotional well-being, providing evidence consistent with the enabling hypothesis and interpersonal emotion regulation models; 4) desiring <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> may represent a marker of poor emotional well-being, but telling a close other about positive and negative events is associated with higher positive affect, 5) considering its role in positive affect, the most important aspect of received <b>emotional</b> <b>support,</b> both with regard to negative and positive events, is feeling understood; and 6) received <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> predicts perceived <b>emotional</b> <b>support,</b> providing evidence for the association between these two constructs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{analyses}} {{focus on}} three aims: (1) {{to explore the}} associations between education and <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> in 22 European countries, (2) to explore the associations between <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> and self-rated health in the European countries, and (3) to analyse whether the association between education and self-rated health can be partly explained by <b>emotional</b> <b>support.</b> Methods The study uses data from the European Social Survey 2003. Probability sampling from all private residents aged 15 years and older was applied in all countries. The European Social Survey includes 42, 359 cases. Persons under age 25 were excluded to minimise the number of respondents whose education was not complete. Education was coded according to the International Standard Classification of Education. Perceived <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> was assessed by {{the availability of a}} confidant with whom one can discuss intimate and personal matters with. Self-rated health was used as health indicator. Results Results of multiple logistic regression analyses show that <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> is positively associated with education among women and men in most European countries. However, the magnitude of the association varies according to country and gender. <b>Emotional</b> <b>support</b> is positively associated with self-rated health. Again, gender and country differences in the association were observed. <b>Emotional</b> <b>support</b> explains little of the educational differences in self-rated health among women and men in most European countries.

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{computers}} {{could offer}} <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> {{as well as}} task support when aiding a user for a complex task, there is little current understanding of how they might do this. Moreover existing demonstrations of <b>emotional</b> <b>support,</b> though promising, only cover {{a small number of}} types of support and investigate a limited number of algorithms designed by hand. In this paper, we present an empirical investigation that starts from first principles, determining different categories of stressors for which <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> might be useful, different categories of <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> utterances and promising algorithms for deciding the content and form of textual <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> messages according to the stressors present. At each stage, the results are validated through empirical experiments with human participants who, for instance, are required to place statements into categories, evaluate possible support messages in different imagined situations and compose their own <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> from options offered. This development methodology allows us to avoid potentially challenging ethical issues in presenting people with stressful situations. Although our algorithms are attempting to choose <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> based on the general, “naive” competence of human speakers, we use as a running example situations that can arise when attending a medical emergency and awaiting expert help...|$|R

40|$|<b>Emotional</b> <b>support,</b> as an {{important}} form of social supports, has great impact {{on the life of}} both caregivers and receivers. Many studies on adult children and old parents indicate that <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> is closely related to parents’ well-being, and the relation quality between old parents and adult children is one of the factors influencing adult children’s support offering. However, the study on adolescents’ <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> to their parents is quite rare. What’s more, it has been found that <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> skills children have learnt at home have life-time influence on children’s response to other’s emotional needs. It is assumed that to some extent the <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> styles between parents and adolescents are relatively stable, and they are related to the care children give to their parents after they advance to old age. Hence, it is necessary to study the <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> of adolescent in order to at last improve the well-being of old parents. Totally speaking, the aim {{of this study is to}} explore the relation between parenting styles and adolescents’ <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> offering, as well as the effects of mother-child relationships. In addition, culture is a factor having impact on parenting styles, parent-child relationships and <b>emotional</b> <b>support.</b> So we have designed this cross-cultural study to explore cultural differences. The results are as follows: (1) As to Chinese and Indonesian mothers, their Acceptance of adolescents’ behaviors has significant positive predictive effect on children’s <b>emotional</b> <b>support.</b> Besides, the Intimacy and Approval dimensions of mother-child relationships partially mediate the path from parenting styles to <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> offering, and those effects have no significant difference in China and Indonesia. (2) Chinese and Indonesian mother’s Rejection to adolescents has significant positive predictive effect on Conflict between mothers and adolescents, but has no direct effect on adolescents’ <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> offering. (3) Adolescents’ support offering has no significant predictive effect on their willingness to help their parents. (4) Adolescents’ support offering has significant predictive effect on their motivation to provide <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> to their parents. However, the relation between adolescents’ support offering and the willingness to help their parents is not clear. (5) Adolescents have scored high in Acceptance parenting style dimension and relatively low in Rejection dimension, which indicate that mothers in China and Indonesia adopt positive parenting styles. Both Chinese and Indonesian mother-child relationships are good. However, Indonesian adolescents have perceived more Intimacy and Approval from mothers, and there is no significant difference between Chinese and Indonesian adolescents and mothers in the dimension of Conflict. 情感支持作为社会支持的一种重要形式无论对支持提供者和接受者都具有重要作用，影响他们的生活质量。针对成年子女和老年父母的很多研究发现情感支持与父母的身心健康密切相关。老年父母与子女间的情感交流和关系质量是影响子女对父母提供支持的重要因素。但是针对青少年的此类研究相对较少。其次，研究表明儿童在家庭环境中所学到的情感支持技能影响儿童对他人情感需求的反应，这种影响持续一生。我们假设青少年时期形成的与父母间的情感支持模式具有一定的稳定性，与父母年老后子女表现出的支持行为有一定的相关，因此，有必要对青少年的情感支持行为进行研究，进而为从发展的角度来看待亲子间的情感支持打基础，并为最终改善成年子女和老年父母的情感支持做铺垫。总体来说，本研究的目的在于：探讨教养方式是否对青少年给予母亲的情感支持产生影响，并考察亲子关系在其中的作用。另外，文化是影响教养方式、亲子关系和情感支持行为的重要因素，因此为考察跨文化的普遍性，我们以中国和印尼青少年和母亲作为研究被试。研究的主要结果和结论如下： （ 1 ）对于中国和印尼母亲来说，对孩子行为的“接受”对子女给予她们情感支持行为有预测作用。而亲子关系中的“亲密”和“赞赏”因素起部分中介作用，并且这些作用具有跨文化一致性。 （ 2 ）中国和印尼母亲对子女的“拒绝”可正向预测亲子间的“冲突”，但不能预测子女对母亲的情感支持行为，这个结果在中国和印尼都得到验证。 （ 3 ）子女给予母亲的情感支持并不能有效地预测对母亲的帮助意愿。 （ 4 ）子女给予母亲的情感支持可以正向预测子女在帮助父母时的“情感帮助动机”，即帮助父母是为在情感上支持他们。但与具体帮助行为的关系有待进一步全面研究。 （ 5 ）中国和印尼青少年“接受”得分较高，“拒绝”得分较低，可见，两国母亲都采取了积极的教养方式。中国、印尼亲子关系较好，但印尼青少年比中国青少年感到与母亲更加“亲密”，受到母亲更多“赞赏”，“冲突”因素上两国无显著差异...|$|R

Opinions differ on whether <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> falls within the field of nursing, and studies also show that nurses in an elderly home care setting fail when it comes to giving <b>emotional</b> <b>support.</b> The aim of this study was to explore reasons for registered nurses to give <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> to older patients in a municipal home care setting. The study was conducted using Grounded Theory. Data collection was carried out through interviews with 16 registered nurses. The inclusion criteria were <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> given to patients aged 80 years and above living in ordinary or sheltered housing and who were in need of help from both the home help service and registered nurses. The results show that the main concern of <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> was &#x 201 C;Trying to relieve the patient from their emotions so they are able to cope with everyday life. &#x 201 D; This core category illustrates how registered nurses tried to support the patients&#x 2019; own strength, so that they were able to move forward. Registered nurses consider that they could support the patients because they give them access to, or could create access to, their emotions, but there were also times when they felt helplessness and as a result, consciously opted out. The results also indicate that registered nurses were keen to give <b>emotional</b> <b>support.</b> To develop patient-centered elderly care, more knowledge of <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> and the elderly&#x 0027;s need for this support is required...|$|R
40|$|Objectives Both <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> and {{negative}} interaction {{with family members}} {{have been linked to}} mental health. However, few studies have examined the associations between <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> {{and negative}} interaction and psychiatric disorders in late life. This study investigated the relationship between <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> and negative interaction on lifetime prevalence of mood and anxiety disorders among older African Americans. Design The analyses utilized the National Survey of American Life. Methods Logistic regression and negative binomial regression analyses were used to examine the effect of <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> and negative interaction with family members on the prevalence of lifetime DSM-IV mood and anxiety disorders. Participants Data from 786 African Americans aged 55 years and older were used. Measurement The DSM-IV World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI) was used to assess mental disorders. Three dependent variables were investigated: the prevalence of lifetime mood disorders, the prevalence of lifetime anxiety. Results Multivariate analysis found that <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> was not associated with any of the three dependent variables. Negative interaction was significantly and positively associated with the odds of having a lifetime mood disorder, a lifetime anxiety disorder and the number of lifetime mood and anxiety disorders. Conclusions This is the first study to investigate the relationships among <b>emotional</b> <b>support,</b> negative interaction with family members and psychiatric disorders among older African Americans. Negative interaction was a risk factor for mood and anxiety disorders among older African Americans, whereas <b>emotional</b> <b>support</b> was not significant.
