5000|$|The UNIVAC 1005, an {{enhanced}} {{version of the}} UNIVAC 1004, was introduced in February 1966. The main improvement over the 1004 was conversion from the plug-board program to an <b>internal</b> <b>stored</b> <b>program.</b> The machine saw extensive use by the US Army, including the first use of an electronic computer on the battlefield. Additional peripherals were also available including a paper tape reader and a three pocket stacker selectable card read/punch. The machine had a two-stage assembler (SAAL - Single Address Assembly Language) which was its primary assembler; it also had a three-stage card based compiler for a programming language called SARGE. 1005s were used as some nodes on Autodin.|$|E

The computer operated for 14 years and was originally intended for training purposes within government agencies, but some of the earliest assemblers and compilers were built for it. It was the fastest fully functional computer for about a year until the UNIVAC I came out in 1951. It also served as a model for other government computers e.g. with the National Security Agency.|$|R

40|$|Stimulation {{of cells}} with calcium-mobilizing {{agonists}} frequently results in inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (InsP 3) -mediated discharge of Ca from an <b>internal</b> <b>store.</b> We report here a technique for directly monitoring Ca within {{this and other}} stores in gastric epithelial cells. This technique {{takes advantage of the}} propensity of the acetoxymethyl ester derivative of the fluorescent dye mag-fura- 2 (which is sensitive to Ca concentrations above 5 microM) to accumulate in subcellular compartments where it can report changes in the free Ca concentration. Intact dye-loaded cells responded to cholinergic stimulation with a decrease in the 350 nm/ 385 nm excitation ratio, as measured in individual cells with a digital imaging microscope, consistent with reduced Ca concentration in one or more cellular compartments. When cells were permeabilized with digitonin and incubated in an "intracellular buffer," the cytoplasmic dye was released, leaving the mag-fura- 2 in the <b>internal</b> <b>store.</b> InsP 3 caused the ratio from the trapped indicator to decrease (i. e., Ca was released) in a dose-dependent manner, and this effect was blocked by the InsP 3 receptor antagonist heparin. Ca sequestration into the <b>internal</b> <b>store</b> was ATP-dependent, and reuptake into the InsP 3 -sensitive pool was blocked by thapsigargin, a specific inhibitor of the Ca-ATPase of the <b>internal</b> <b>store.</b> We used this technique to investigate the role of Cl on the release and reloading of the InsP 3 -sensitive <b>internal</b> <b>store</b> and found that Ca uptake was reduced in Cl-free solutions, suggesting an important function for Cl in the refilling of this pool...|$|R

Accurate wind tunnel tests {{can help to}} improve the release stability of the stores and in-flight safety of the aircrafts in supersonic environments. A simulative system for free drop experiments of <b>internal</b> <b>stores</b> based on a practical project is provided in this paper. The system contains a store release mechanism, a control system and an attitude measurement system. The release mechanism adopts a six-bar linkage driven by a cylinder, which ensures the release stability. The structure and initial aerodynamic parameters of the stores are also designed and adjusted. A high speed vision measurement system for high speed rolling targets is utilized to measure the pose parameters of the <b>internal</b> <b>store</b> models and an optimizing method for the coordinates of markers is presented based on a priori model. The experimental results show excellent repeatability of the system, and indicate that the position measurement precision is less than 0. 13  mm, and the attitude measurement precision for pitch and yaw angles is less than 0. 126 °, satisfying the requirements of practical wind tunnel tests.

40|$|The {{secretion}} {{of insulin}} from pancreatic β-cells is {{triggered by the}} influx of Ca 2 + through voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels. The resulting elevation of intracellular calcium ([Ca 2 +]i) triggers additional Ca 2 + release from <b>internal</b> <b>stores.</b> Less well understood are the mechanisms involved in Ca 2 + mobilization from <b>internal</b> <b>stores</b> after activation of Ca 2 + influx. The mobilization process is known as calcium-induced calcium release (CICR). In this study, {{our goal was to}} investigate the existence of and the role of caffeine-sensitive ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in a rat pancreatic β-cell line, INS- 1 cells. To measure cytosolic and stored Ca 2 +, respectively, cultured INS- 1 cells were loaded with fura- 2 /AM or furaptra/AM. [Ca 2 +]i was repetitively increased by caffeine stimulation in normal Ca 2 + buffer. However, peak [Ca 2 +]i was only observed after the first caffeine stimulation in Ca 2 + free buffer and this increase was markedly blocked by ruthenium red, a RyR blocker. KCl-induced elevations in [Ca 2 +]i were reduced by pretreatment with ruthenium red, as well as by depletion of internal Ca 2 + stores using cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) or caffeine. Caffeine-induced Ca 2 + mobilization ceased after the <b>internal</b> <b>stores</b> were depleted by carbamylcholine (CCh) or CPA. In permeabilized INS- 1 cells, Ca 2 + release from <b>internal</b> <b>stores</b> was activated by caffeine, Ca 2 +, or ryanodine. Furthermore, ruthenium red completely blocked the CICR response in permeabilized cells. RyRs were widely distributed throughout the intracellular compartment of INS- 1 cells. These results suggest that caffeine-sensitive RyRs exist and modulate the CICR response from <b>internal</b> <b>stores</b> in INS- 1 pancreatic β-cells...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEvoked {{transmitter}} release {{depends upon}} calcium influx into synaptic boutons, but mechanisms regulating bouton calcium levels and spontaneous transmitter release are obscure. To understand these processes better, we monitored calcium transients in axons and presynaptic terminals of pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slice cultures. Action potentials reliably evoke calcium transients in axons and boutons. Calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) from <b>internal</b> <b>stores</b> {{contributes to the}} transients in boutons and to paired-pulse facilitation of EPSPs. Store depletion activates store-operated calcium channels, influencing the frequency of spontaneous transmitter release. Boutons display spontaneous Ca 2 + transients; blocking CICR reduces the frequency of these transients and of spontaneous miniature synaptic events. Thus, spontaneous transmitter release is largely calcium mediated, driven by Ca 2 + release from <b>internal</b> <b>stores.</b> Bouton store release is important for short-term synaptic plasticity and may also contribute to long-term plasticity...|$|R
40|$|Addition of {{crosslinking}} antibody to B lymphocytes {{results in}} a rapid rise in cytoplasmic-free Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]i) due to release of Ca 2 + from <b>internal</b> <b>stores</b> and uptake of Ca 2 + across the plasma membrane. Inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate is believed to mediate the release of internal Ca 2 + stores and has also been proposed to mediate extracellular Ca 2 + entry. We have compared the properties of these two pathways for Ca 2 + mobilization by dissociating the [Ca 2 +]i changes in ligand-activated human B cells after loading of the cells with the Ca 2 + chelator BAPTA. In the present paper we show that: (a) the sustained increase in [Ca 2 +]i is due to increased unidirectional influx of external [Ca 2 +]i; (b) entry of extracellular Ca 2 +, but not release of <b>internal</b> <b>stores,</b> is sensitive to the transmembrane potential; and (c) entry of extracellular Ca 2 +, but not release of <b>internal</b> <b>stores,</b> is inhibited by increasing [Ca 2 +]i. These {{findings suggest that the}} permeation pathways mediating the translocation of Ca 2 + across the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum membrane are not identical...|$|R

40|$|Increases in cytoplasmic Ca(2 +) {{are crucial}} for {{inducing}} the initial steps of myoblast differentiation that {{ultimately lead to}} fusion; yet the mechanisms that produce this elevated Ca(2 +) have not been fully resolved. For example, it is still unclear whether the increase comes exclusively from membrane Ca(2 +) influx or also from Ca(2 +) release from <b>internal</b> <b>stores.</b> To address this, we investigated early differentiation of myoblast clones each derived from single post-natal human satellite cells. Initial differentiation was assayed by immunostaining myonuclei for the transcription factor MEF 2. When Ca(2 +) influx was eliminated by using low external Ca(2 +) media, we found that approximately half the clones could still differentiate. Of the clones that required influx of external Ca(2 +), most clones used T-type Ca(2 +) channels, but others used store-operated channels as influx-generating mechanisms. On the other hand, clones that differentiated in low external Ca(2 +) relied on Ca(2 +) release from <b>internal</b> <b>stores</b> through IP(3) receptors. Interestingly, by following clones over time, we observed that some switched their preferred Ca(2 +) source: clones that initially used calcium release from <b>internal</b> <b>stores</b> to differentiate later required Ca(2 +) influx and inversely. In conclusion, we show that human myoblasts can use three alternative mechanisms to increase cytoplasmic Ca(2 +) {{at the onset of}} the differentiation process: influx through T-types Ca(2 +) channels, influx through store operated channels and release from <b>internal</b> <b>stores</b> through IP(3) receptors. In addition, we suggest that, probably because Ca(2 +) elevation is essential during initial differentiation, myoblasts may be able to select between these alternate Ca(2 +) pathways...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThapsigargin-sensitive sarco/endoplasmic {{reticulum}} Ca 2 + pumps (SERCAs) {{are involved}} in maintaining and replenishing agonist-sensitive <b>internal</b> <b>stores.</b> Although it has been assumed that release channels act independently of SERCA pumps, there are data suggesting the opposite. Our aim was to study the relationship between SERCA pumps and the release channels in smooth muscle cells. To this end, we have rapidly blocked SERCA pumps with thapsigargin, to avoid depletion of the internal Ca 2 + stores, and induced Ca 2 + release with either caffeine, to open ryanodine receptors, or acetylcholine, to open inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate receptors. Blocking SERCA pumps produced smaller and slower agonist-induced [Ca 2 +]i responses. We determined the Ca 2 + level of the <b>internal</b> <b>stores</b> both indirectly, measuring the frequency of spontaneous transient outward currents, and directly, using Mag-Fura- 2, and demonstrated that the inhibition of SERCA pumps did not produce a reduction of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + levels to explain the decrease in the agonist-induced Ca 2 + responses. It appears that SERCA pumps {{are involved in}} sustaining agonist-induced Ca 2 + release by a mechanism that involves the modulation of Ca 2 + availability in the lumen of the <b>internal</b> <b>stores...</b>|$|R

The changes in [Ca"]; are biphasic, being comprised of a rapid, transient peak, followed by a sustained, but smaller increase. The transient peak appears to be predominantly due to the release from <b>internal</b> <b>stores,</b> whereas the sustained plateau requires entry of extracellular Ca 2 + across the plasma membrane since, in contrast to the transient peak, the sustained increase is dependent on the availability of external Ca 2 + (1, 2).
