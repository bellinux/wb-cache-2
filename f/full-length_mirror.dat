2500|$|In 1970, Gordon Gallup, Jr., {{experimentally}} {{investigated the}} possibility of self-recognition with two male and two female wild pre-adolescent chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), none of which had presumably seen a mirror previously.

60|$|For a {{full minute}} she did not speak, possessed still by that strange terror and by a sort of shame. She did not even look at her son, but cast timid glances round his room.

A silver cup of flowers was reflected in that mirror. Mrs. Pendyce saw that they were dead, and the sense of their vague and nauseating odour was her first definite sensation.|$|E
60|$|I {{would have}} been glad to gaze at myself in a <b>full-length</b> <b>mirror,</b> {{but there was no}} {{opportunity}} for the indulgence of such vanity; and before leaving the room I sat down for a moment to give a few thoughts to the situation. My mind first reverted to the soaked condition of my garments and the difficulty of getting them dry enough for me to put them on and continue my journey. Then I found that I had dropped the subject and was thinking of the slender girl, wondering if she had really hurt herself very much, congratulating myself that I had been fortunate enough to be on hand to help her in her need, and considering what a plight she {{would have been}} in if she had been caught in that terrible rain and utterly unable to get herself to shelter.|$|E

And the husband looked back at her, calm, practical, protecting. They were very much alike. So doubtless he looked when he presented himself in snowy shirt-sleeves for her to straighten the bow of his white tie; so nightly she would look, standing before the <b>full-length</b> <b>mirror,</b> fixing his gifts upon her bosom. Calm, proprietary, kind! He passed them and walked behind a second less distinguished couple, who manifested a mutual dislike as matter-of-fact and free from nonsense as the unruffled satisfaction of the first; this dislike was just as healthy, and produced in Shelton about the same sensation. It was like knocking at a never-opened door, looking at a circle--couple after couple all the same. No heads, toes, angles of their souls stuck out anywhere. In the sea of their environments they were drowned; no leg braved the air, no arm emerged wet and naked waving at the skies; shop-persons, aristocrats, workmen, officials, they were all respectable. And he himself as respectable as any.|$|E
2500|$|After his {{accident}} and {{the closure of}} the WBF, Luger joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Bobby [...] "The Brain" [...] Heenan [...] "unveiled" [...] him with the persona of [...] "Narcissus" [...] at Royal Rumble 1993. Shortly thereafter, his name was altered slightly to [...] "The Narcissist". Luger posed before <b>full-length</b> <b>mirrors</b> before every match. The WWF also incorporated his motorcycle accident into his gimmick, capitalizing on {{the fact that he had}} a [...] "metal plate" [...] inserted into his forearm which was said to cause more damage when it struck an opponent, often allowing Luger to pin them with only his pinky finger placed on their chest. This caused a number of his opponents to demand that he wear a cover over it during matches when he had a streak of knocking people out. This eventually led to WWF officials demanding that Luger wear an elbow pad, though he would often remove it. The Narcissist's one major feud was with Mr. Perfect. The feud was based on Heenan, his advisor, referring to him as being [...] "Beyond Perfection," [...] in a slight at Mr. Perfect, his former managerial client. The rivalry ended at WrestleMania IX when Luger defeated Perfect.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, the Mark Morris Dance Group {{purchased}} a derelict {{building on the}} corner of Flatbush and Lafayette Avenues in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, located just one block west from the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The goal was not only to house the company, but also to build a public facility for dance. A $7.4 million capital campaign was launched in order to build the center, and donations were received from both public and private sources. The architectural firm Beyer Blinder Belle Architects and Planners, led by architect Fred Bland, designed the building - the dancer’s dressing rooms, Morris’ personal office, and the staff’s offices were placed together on the same floor to maintain a sense of unity and family. Construction broke ground in 1999 and the center was completed in September 2001. The staff moved in during March 2001 and dancers began rehearsals in July. When first built, the Dance Center occupied the top three floors of the building - more than 18, 0 sq ft of space. It consisted of three column-free dance studios with wood-sprung floors, <b>full-length</b> <b>mirrors</b> and sound systems. The main studio on the top floor, known as the largest unobstructed dance studio in New York City, measured 3,600 square-feet (60’ by 60’) and was envisioned to be equipped one day with theatrical lighting and retractable seating to accommodate everything from casual showings to formal concerts.|$|R

5000|$|When Chandler merged {{his stories}} into a novel, he spent more effort on {{expanding}} descriptions of people, places, and Marlowe's thinking than getting {{every detail of}} the plot perfectly consistent. In [...] "The Curtain", the description of Mrs. O'Mara's room is just enough to establish the setting: [...] "This room had a white carpet from wall to wall. Ivory drapes of immense height lay tumbled casually on the white carpet inside the many windows. The windows stared towards the dark foot-hills, and the air beyond the glass was dark too. It hadn't started to rain yet, there was a feeling of pressure in the atmosphere." [...] In The Big Sleep, Chandler expanded this description of the room and used new detail (e.g., the contrast of white and [...] "bled out", the coming rain) to foreshadow the fact that Mrs. Regan (Mrs. O'Mara in the original story) is covering up the murder of her husband by her sister and that the coming rainstorm will bring more deaths: [...] "The room was too big, the ceiling was too high, the doors were too tall, and the white carpet that went from wall to wall looked like a fresh fall of snow at Lake Arrowhead.

40|$|Cytoplasmic Ca 2 + {{is known}} to {{regulate}} Na+–Ca 2 + exchanger (NCX) activity by binding to two adjacent Ca 2 +-binding domains (CBD 1 and CBD 2) located in the large intracellular loop between transmembrane segments 5 and 6.

Data indicate that the exchanger assembles as a dimer in the plasma membrane. Addition of Ca 2 + decreases {{the distance between the}} cytoplasmic loops of NCX pairs. The Ca 2 +-dependent movements detected between paired NCXs were abolished by mutating the Ca 2 + coordination sites in CBD 1 (D 421 A, E 451 A, and D 500 V), whereas disruption of the primary Ca 2 + coordination site in CBD 2 (E 516 L) had no effect. Thus, the Ca 2 +-induced conformational changes of NCX dimers arise from the movement of CBD 1. FRET studies of CBD 1, CBD 2, and CBD 1 –CBD 2 peptides displayed Ca 2 +-dependent movements with different apparent affinities. CBD 1 –CBD 2 showed a Ca 2 +-dependent phenotype <b>mirroring</b> <b>full-length</b> NCX but distinct from both CBD 1 and CBD 2...|$|R
60|$|Up to {{that moment}} a delighted but unsmiling {{consciousness}} of their own absurdities, {{a keen sense of}} the humorous possibilities of the original blunder, and a mischievous recognition of the mortification of Trigg--whose only safety now lay in accepting the mistake in the same spirit--had determined these grown-up schoolboys to artfully protract a joke that seemed to be providentially delivered into their hands. But NOW an odd change crept on them. The light from the open window that gave upon the enormous pines and the rolling prospect up to the dim heights of the Sierras fell upon this strange, incongruous, yet perfectly artistic figure. For the dress was the skillful creation of a great Parisian artist, and in its exquisite harmony of color, shape, and material it not only hid the absurd model, but clothed it with an alarming grace and refinement! A queer feeling of awe, of shame, and of unwilling admiration took possession of them. Some of them--from remote Western towns--had never seen the like before; those who HAD had forgotten it in those five years of self-exile, of healthy independence, and of contiguity to Nature in her unaffected simplicity. All had been familiar with the garish, extravagant, and dazzling femininity of the Californian towns and cities, but never had they known anything approaching the ideal grace of this type of exalted, even if artificial, womanhood. And although in the fierce freedom of their little republic they had laughed to scorn such artificiality, a few yards of satin and lace cunningly fashioned, and thrown over a frame of wood and wire, touched them now with a strange sense of its superiority. The better to show its attractions, Clinton Grey had placed the figure near a <b>full-length,</b> gold-framed <b>mirror,</b> beside a marble-topped table. Yet how cheap and tawdry these splendors showed beside this work of art! How cruel was the contrast of their own rough working clothes to this miracle of adornment which that same mirror reflected! And even when Clinton Grey, the enthusiast, looked towards his beloved woods for relief, he could not help thinking of them as a more fitting frame for this strange goddess than this new house into which she had strayed. Their gravity became real; their gibes in some strange way had vanished.|$|R

40|$|A shortened, {{recombinant}} protein comprising residues 109 - 666 of the tailspike endorhamnosidase of Salmonella phage P 22 was purified from Escherichia coli and crystallized. Like the full-length tailspike, the protein lacking the amino-terminal head-binding domain is an SDS-resistant, thermostable trimer. Its fluorescence and circular dichroism spectra indicate native structure. Oligosaccharide binding and endoglycosidase activities of both proteins are identical. A number of tailspike folding mutants {{have been obtained}} previously in a genetic approach to protein folding. Two temperature-sensitive-folding (tsf) mutations and the four known global second-site suppressor (su) mutations were introduced into the shortened protein and found to reduce or increase folding yields at high temperature. The mutational effects on folding yields and subunit folding kinetics parallel those observed with the <b>full-length</b> protein. They <b>mirror</b> the in vivo phenotypes and {{are consistent with the}} substitutions altering the stability of thermolabile folding intermediates. Because full-length and shortened tailspikes aggregate upon thermal denaturation, and their denaturant-induced unfolding displays hysteresis, kinetics of thermal unfolding were measured to assess the stability of the native proteins. Unfolding of the shortened wild-type protein in the presence of 2 % SDS at 71 degrees C occurs at a rate of 9. 2 x 10 (- 4) s(- 1). It reflects the second kinetic phase of unfolding of the full-length protein. All six mutations were found to affect the thermal stability of the native protein. Both tsf mutations accelerate thermal unfolding about 10 -fold. Two of the su mutations retard thermal unfolding up to 5 -fold, while the remaining two mutations accelerate unfolding up to 5 -fold. The mutational effects can be rationalized on the background of the recently determined crystal structure of the protein...|$|R
