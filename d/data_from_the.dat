In this project, we propose a signature-based indexing method to optimize the storage and retrieval of a relative <b>data’s</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> large database. ...|$|R

The transcript of the CVR was released on August 1. It shows that the pilots were aware of the wet runway conditions and the deactivated thrust reverser. The pilots' comments suggest that the spoilers did not deploy and that they were unable to slow the aircraft. Crew error has not been ruled out.|$|E

30|$|This {{second result}} of Figures  5 and 6 {{can be seen}} by {{comparing}} the ratio of ingoing and outgoing data for each request type. Here we see the asymmetric algorithm reduces the overall amount of <b>data</b> going <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cloud to the premise (red part of the chart). This can be a major factor when charges associated with <b>data</b> going <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cloud to the premise are more expensive than charges for <b>data</b> going <b>from</b> <b>the</b> premise to the cloud. On average over the request types, asymmetric partitioning reduces the overall amount of <b>data</b> going <b>from</b> <b>the</b> cloud to the premise by a factor of 52 %. As we see in the next experiment, this can play a role in decreasing the total cost of deployment.|$|R
