Media jobs offer autonomy, but this is constrained by tight performance demands and low pay.

40|$|This {{paper is}} the result of an ethnographic {{research}} conducted in the Turkish and Moroccan communities of the Hodimont neighborhood in Verviers. The analysis aims to highlight the matrimonial strategies and the influence of the community into these ones.    A triangular interaction between parents / child / community is at the hart of each wedding’s decision. The modality of this interaction – more or less flexible – seems to be crucial in the determination of the marriage’s form and in the constraining force that can weigh on young people for the choice of their partner. Moreover, every component of young people’s life within the community is influenced by the relations with the parents and the community members. Education, socialization, religious experience, gender perceptions, <b>economic</b> <b>contingencies</b> are dimensions that are crossed by parental and community recommendations. In this context, it can be hard for young people to find a right balance between the fulfillment of the family’s wills and the respect of their own desire.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the epistemological {{life cycle of}} the camera lens in documentary practices. The 19 th century industrial economies that manufactured and commercialised the camera lens have engendered political and <b>economic</b> <b>contingencies</b> on documentary practices to sustain a hegemonic and singular interpretive epistemology. Colonial documentary practices are considered {{from the viewpoint of}} manipulative hegemonic practices - all of which use the interpretive epistemology of the camera lens to capitalise a viewpoint which is singular and possesses the power to sustain its own status and economic privilege. I suggest that decolonising documentary practices can be nurtured in what Boaventura de Sousa Santos proposes as an 'ecology of knowledges' (Andreotti, Ahenakew, & Cooper 2011) - a way of including the epistemologies of cultures beyond the 'abyssal' (Santos), outside the limits of epistemological dominance. If an 'epistemicide' (Santos) of indigenous knowledges in the dominant limits has occurred then in an ecology of knowledges the limits become limitless and what were once invisible knowledges, come into their own ontological and epistemological being: as free agents and on their own terms. In an ecology of knowledges, ignorance and blindness may still exist but are not privileged. The decolonisation of documentary practices inevitably destabilises prevailing historicities and initiates ways for equal privilege to exist between multiple epistemologies...|$|R

The document aims to propose guidelines for a strategic re-planning of the Brazilian ceramic tiles sector, making the Brazilian producers aware of the national market fragility (in spite of its recent remarkable evolution) and helping the policy makers to reflect on the need of reviewing the strategic planning methods and practice, of designing new targeted programs (based on coherence between operation and business strategies), of providing improved management to strengthen the sector against unfair competition by low-cost producers, enhancing the necessary infrastructure in technology, work, marketing and quality management. The analysis is limited to the single-firing production technology. The wide-coverage strategic analysis of the Brazilian ceramic tiles sector, very little studied until now in a scientific way, emphasizes the importance of applying research methodology and may be valuable to both scholars and practitioners. Additionally, it highlights the need of investments in innovation (product design and production technology) and the fundamental role of the sector organization, identifying different dimensions.

The IUC Independent Policy Report argues for a radical change of perspective, capable of restoring the supremacy of the law over the economic system. It is not only about finance, nor is it only about economics or policy. In this sense a transnational set of normative principles is {{needed in order to}} establish a global legal system capable of controlling economic processes, rather than being controlled by them. Within this framework a series of policy proposals are presented in order to effectively implement a new system of global standards. The current Western standard of living is unsustainable. Should the rest share the model of development of the West, our planet will simply not be capable of resisting the growth in consumption and pollution. Within this fundamental setting of scarcity in resources, using the rhetoric of the end of history as the polar star for growth, development and ultimately happiness of the whole world is simply a cynical lie. We argue here for the beginning of a necessary process aimed at the development of a legal system that is much less about creating an effcient backbone for an exploitive economy and much more about a vision of civilization, justice and respect where the laws of nature and those of humans converge in a sustainable long-term philosophy. Principles of justice, responsibility and long term environmental protection, rather than short term <b>economic</b> <b>contingency</b> and strong interests must set the legal agenda. A new governance and bottom-up inclusive integration of knowledge-based economies (wherever located), which is crucial to the very survival of humankind, cannot happen without defning new terms of a widely accepted standard of long term justice in the transnational context, hence the urgency to conceive legitimate transnational legal structures and possibly some apparatus of “superlegality. ” The report is composed of fve sections. After having presented the pitfalls of the prevailing theoretical apparatus, an alternative cultural grid upon which policy actions should be shaped is presented.

I decided to select, as an example, those changes made to the Educational system by the Victorian Liberal Government in 1992. By choosing this example, I hoped in the first two chapters to (1) clarify the notion of the "New Right" and (2) demonstrate how new right tendencies were having their effect on the Australian educational scene. I would then proceed in the following four chapters to inquire into the historical basis of new right tendencies, review some of the literature which discusses "new right" ideology, and examine the impact of "new right" thinking in Britain and the United States of America. Then, in chapter seven I would, using as a basis a comparative review of the British and United States' initiatives, give my own evaluation of the "new right" ideology. By and large, the structure of my thesis is still as originally intended. However, it became apparent to me, on investigating the Victorian initiatives, that it is not always obvious when educational reforms are to be appropriately labeled as "new right" phenomena. For one thing, the label of "new right" may sometimes be disavowed by those who are promoting the reforms, the promoters of the reforms claiming that the restructuring taking place is a response to <b>economic</b> <b>contingencies</b> which have nothing to do with "new right" thinking but are simply matters of commonsense expediency. Moreover, such apparently "new right" concepts, such as "school-based-self- management", can be seen as having a long history of support by both Liberal and Labour government supporters and by educational theorists of both the left and right. In other words, educational reforms may conform to "new right" principles without their actually being driven by "new right" thinking. Any claim that the Victorian initiatives exemplify "new right" thinking therefore has to be argued for. In the first two chapters I argue that the literature justifying such initiatives does show that the reforms are at least in part driven by "new right" thinking, and this becomes evident when we consider the motives for the reforms and not just the reforms themselves. I suggest that while the ideology of "new right" thinking appeals to concepts such as freedom, self-management and autonomy (concepts which educators of many persuasions would find congenial), in fact, these concepts and principles are not valued for educational reasons but for reasons to do with economic rationalism. I return to this topic in chapter seven where I consider, in detail, the claim that "new right" thinking demonstrates a respect for freedom and autonomy. My argument is that, while the "new right" philosophy may contain concepts and principles which sound attractive to many educators, these concepts are a smokescreen for what is, in reality, a free market ideology which does not have education as one of its central or over-riding values...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} evolving market {{structure of the}} American motion picture industry between 1963 and 1980. Essentially, the analysis begins with the Paramount litigation and concentrates its focus on domestic exhibition, tracing its changing relationship {{to the rest of}} the system that is the American film business. Production, distribution and foreign exhibition, along with America 2 ̆ 7 s theatre owners, are all seen as forming their own separate tiers, exhibiting needs and patterns of business behavior distinct from one another. Simultaneously, these separate tiers are also conceptualized as being cogs that coordinate in an even larger system, the American motion picture industry. This within and between tier unit of analysis, then, serves as the basis on which this inquiry is organized. ^ Briefly, the Paramount Decision is analyzed as having fragmented the tier of domestic exhibition, while leaving the power and status of both American production and distribution essentially intact. Because of slow compliance with the consent decrees, the true effects of the Paramount Decision on the overall structure of the American film business were not substantially felt until 1957. Following six successive years of industry-wide losses, the market finally started to bottom-out in 1962. Along with bottoming-out, a new and modern structure for the American motion picture industry in general, and domestic exhibition in particular, began to take hold during 1962 - 1963. ^ Traditionally, film industry historians have detailed two specific points, since 1957, where the economy of the American film industry plummeted to critical lows, 1962 - 1963 and 1968 - 1972. This study identifies 1962 - 1963 as the period when domestic exhibition stabilized and began evolving into the structural configuration it displays today. The latter years are when the same process began for America 2 ̆ 7 s major distributors. ^ This dissertation also examines the relationship between domestic exhibition and America 2 ̆ 7 s major distributors. Most times this relationship is an adversarial one, as the reallocation of profits and losses between the two tiers fluctuates sharply during the 1960 s and 1970 s. Within tier friction is also evident between domestic theatre owners themselves, as each exhibitor scrambles for parity in a climate of competition, not cooperation. What results is a market dominated by size and influence, where the industry is controlled by the major distributors, while the tier of exhibition is overshadowed by a handful of major theatre circuits. ^ The major American film distributors have formed a mature oligopoly that has stood in one form or another since the 1930 s. Today, this same patterning is evident in the tier of exhibition as well. The four major theatre circuits, General Cinema, United Artists Theatres, Plitt and American Multi-Cinema, along with a dozen or so mini-major theatre chains have developed a hold on the domestic retailing of movies comparable to the grip exhibited by their counterparts in distribution. This oligopolistic posturing, combined with the rapid development of subscription television, video-cassettes and video-discs, all contribute to altering what movie-going means to Americans today. This dissertation ends with some thoughts about the future of domestic exhibition in the 1980 s, and how technological as well as <b>economic</b> <b>contingencies</b> continue to mold the structure of the American film business, expanding its scope into television and video while adding additional tiers to the motion picture industry 2 ̆ 7 s original four: production, distribution, domestic and foreign exhibition. ...|$|R
40|$|Since 1988 {{reported}} polio cases worldwide {{have declined}} by about 85 % {{and the number}} of known or suspected polioendemic countries has decreased from over 120 to less than 50. With eradication of poliomyelitis approaching, issues potentially affecting when and how vaccination against poliovirus can be stopped become extremely important. Because of the potential risks and benefits inherent in such a decision, the best available science, a risk-benefit analysis, <b>contingency</b> plans, a <b>stock</b> pile of poliovirus vaccines, and the endorsement by the global policy-making committees will all be needed before vaccination can be discontinued. The scientific basis for stopping polio immunization has been reviewed by WHO. This Round Table article summarizes the current state of knowledge, provides an update on the processes and timelines for certification, containment, and stopping vaccination, and highlights some of the unanswered scientific questions that will be addressed by further research. These include whether transmission of vaccine-derived poliovirus strains could be sustained so that poliomyelitis could re-emerge in a future unvaccinated population and whether prolonged excretion of vaccine-derived poliovirus from individuals with immune deficiencies could be a mechanism through which this could occur...|$|R
