5|$|In {{secondary}} spontaneous pneumothorax, {{the estimated}} annual AAIR is 6.3 and 2.0 cases per 100,000 person-years <b>for</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females,</b> respectively, with {{the risk of}} recurrence depending on the presence and severity of any underlying lung disease. Once a second episode has occurred, {{there is a high}} likelihood of subsequent further episodes. The incidence in children has not been well studied, but is estimated to be between 5 and 10 cases per 100,000 person-years.|$|E
5|$|In studies {{conducted}} in Ontario and Quebec, the mortality rate for dominant juveniles was 52%, and mortality was 85% for juveniles who left the parents' territory between fledging in June to approximately mid-October. From fall to the following breeding season in March, further juvenile mortality was 50%. Territory-holding adult grey jays experienced low mortality rates (15.1 and 18.2% <b>for</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females,</b> respectively). The oldest known grey jay recaptured in the wild was at least 17 years old.|$|E
5|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} between {{the growth rate of}} newly metamorphosed juveniles from different altitudes and latitudes, the specimens studied being from Norway, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands and France. At first the growth rates <b>for</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> was identical. By the time they became mature their growth rate had slowed down to about 21% of the initial rate and they had reached 95% of their expected adult size. Some females that were on a biennial breeding cycle carried on growing rapidly for a longer time. Adjusting for differences in temperature and the length of the growing season, the toads grew and matured at much the same rate from the four colder localities. These juveniles reached maturity after 1.09 years for males and 1.55 years for females. However, the young toads from lowland France grew faster and longer to a much greater size taking an average 1.77 years for males and 2.49 years for females before reaching maturity.|$|E

5|$|In a {{study of}} a {{district}} general hospital in the UK, 5.4% of all the hospital's self-harm cases were aged over 65. The male to female ratio was 2:3 although the self-harm rates <b>for</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> over 65 in the local population were identical. Over 90% had depressive conditions, and 63% had significant physical illness. Under 10% of the patients gave a history of earlier self-harm, while both the repetition and suicide rates were very low, which {{could be explained by}} the absence of factors known to be associated with repetition, such as personality disorder and alcohol abuse. However, NICE Guidance on Self-harm in the UK suggests that older people who self-harm are at a greater risk of completing suicide, with 1 in 5 older people who self-harm going on to end their life. A study completed in Ireland showed that older Irish adults have high rates of deliberate self-harm, but comparatively low rates of suicide.|$|E

25|$|Identification of {{tinamous}} {{is not an}} easy task; utilizing {{their calls}} as a tool is integral. Each species has its own unique call or calls. The solitary tinamou has 11 different vocalizations. In most species both sexes call; some have different calls <b>for</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females.</b> Females tend to have deeper voices. Some species, in particular members of Crypturellus, have regional dialects. Male slaty-breasted tinamous have calls unique enough to be individually recognized by humans.|$|E
25|$|A few {{species of}} goby, such as blackeye goby and Lythrypnus dalli, can change their sexes. Sex change is {{possible}} in these gobies, since the external genitalia <b>for</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> <b>females</b> do not differ much. Sex changes can take from days to weeks. Most sex changes in gobies are from female to male (protogyny) rather than male to female (protandry). Female-to-male changes are observed not only in gobies but also in wrasses, damselfishes, and sea basses. Female-to-male change usually occurs because the resident male of the group is dead. If there is no male in the group, reproduction will be impossible. Therefore, the dominant female turns into male, allowing mating to happen. Male-to-female change occurs when the females have preference for specific features in males. For example, female gobies prefer large males, and a few large males mate with multiple females, whereas small males lose their chance to mate. Small males either choose to become sneakers (kleptogamy) or choose to transform into females because all females technically have high mating opportunities. By turning into females, males can ensure that they produce many descendants.|$|E
