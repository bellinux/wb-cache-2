5000|$|The word {{appeared}} in English as grome c.1225, meaning [...] "boy child, boy, youth"; its origin is unknown. It has no known cognates in other Germanic languages (e.g. Dutch and German use compound terms, such as Stal(l)knecht 'stable servant', or equivalents of synonyms mentioned below). Perhaps it stems from an Old English root groma, related to growan [...] "grow" [...] or from Old French grommet [...] "servant" [...] (compare Medieval English <b>gromet</b> for [...] "ship's boy", recorded since 1229).|$|E
5000|$|St. John and Donato soon formed White Tiger. They {{had written}} {{most of the}} {{material}} for the album by mid-1985 {{and set out to}} complete a lineup with which to record. The band also included St. John's younger brother, Michael, on bass, but was completed with the addition of Brian James Fox on drums. While the independent release did well on that level selling some 50,000 copies, and the band gigged around California, St. John and his band White Tiger joined up with Garry Lane owner of Logic Productions who promoted many top bands in LA. St. John and Lane became good friends meeting for a second time at Trojan Studios in Garden Grove, California. That is where St. John and Lane {{came up with the idea}} to play the legendary club known as THE HOT SPOT located in Huntington Beach, California owned by Gennie <b>Gromet</b> who was the ex-wife of Dick Dale from the band Dick Dale and the Del-Tones. The band didn't manage to break and split while working on demos for a second album in 1988. St. John teamed up with Jeff Scott Soto in 1988 to make a demo. St. John also did some session work performing lead guitar on [...] "Livin' for My Lord" [...] on Ken Tamplin's 1990 album, Axe to Grind. Tamplin is an inspirational Christian rocker more famed for his involvement in the band Shout. Tamplin has also co-written material with Gene Simmons of Kiss. St. John also worked with former Knight Rider star David Hasselhoff, even appearing in his video, [...] "Is Everyone Happy".|$|E
40|$|Along the Connecticut and Rhode Island {{boundary}} {{and extending}} into Massachusetts is the Hope Valley shear zone (Fig. 1). On opposite sides are two distinct late-Precambrian Avalonian terranes, the Esmond-Dedham terrane containing the Ponaganset gneiss to the east, and the Hope Valley terrane containing the Hope Valley alaskite {{to the west}} (Moore, 1964; Quinn, 1971; <b>Gromet</b> and O`Hara, 1985; O`Hara and <b>Gromet,</b> 1985; Hermes and Zartman, 1985). The Devonian Scituate granite intrudes the Ponaganset gneiss in the southeastern part of the area. The Ponaganset gneiss mostly ranges from granite to tonalite, but small lenticular bodies of diorite and gabbro also occur. Locally, layers of augen gneiss are separated by narrow lenses of amphibolite...|$|E

The fluid-immobile elements, {{such as the}} rare earth elements (REEs) and high-field strength elements (HFSE), remain largely unaffected by diagenesis (Webb et al. 2009); thus, they are useful for recognize the ancient environmental conditions. The mean values of the ΣREEs for the studied samples are 936  ppm. The studied carbonate rocks showed significant enrichment of LREEs and a well-depleted pattern of HREEs (Table  1). The total concentration of total REEs in average bulk continental crust is about 125  ppm (Rudnick and Gao 2003). Thus, geochemical pattern of the studied samples mentioned that high solubility and mobility potential of LREEs compared with HREEs, resulting in good fractionation and enrichment of these elements in the depositional environment. So, the concentration of the (LREEs) is {{higher than that of}} (HREEs), which is in conformance to the general distribution of REEs in shale or limestone (<b>Gromet</b> et al. 1984; Condie 1991; Ketris and Yudovich 2009).|$|E
40|$|Rare earth element (REE) {{contents}} of marine biogenic apatites {{have been shown}} to record seawater compositions. A data base of available and newly acquired rare earth element (REE) {{contents of}} marine biogenic apatites has been created to assess the past seawater REE compositions. To ensure that this data base contains only the pristine REE signals, altered samples, characterized by very low (La/Sm) N ratios (where N stands for REE ratios normalized to the NASC composition; <b>Gromet</b> et al., 1984, Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 48 (1984) 2469) acquired during apatite recrystallization, are not included in the database. These data reveal a change in the Tethyan seawater composition between 110 and 80 Ma. After the end of the Cretaceous, the REE chemistry of seawater remains constant until present-day. This seawater composition change is likely due to concurrent changes in REE scavenging processes. A strong correlation between decreasing (Sm/Yb) N ratios and increasing Ce anomalies for samples deposited during the 80 – 110 Ma period is observed. As Ce anomalies are attributed to ocean water redox conditions, changes in REE scavenging could reflect an evolution from stratified and poorly oxygenated waters towards well-mixed and oxygenated waters. This could have resulted from changing current patterns stemming from the contemporaneous opening of the Atlantic Ocean. A major change in Middle and Late Cretaceous oceanic circulation linked to plate tectonics would have favored the colonization of pelagic environments...|$|E
