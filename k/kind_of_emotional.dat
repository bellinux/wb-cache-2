It flat out does not ask for the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>emotional</b> engagement that more conventional epic biopics do, and that's a good thing". In his review for UGO, Keith Uhlich wrote, [...] "The best to say about Del Toro's Cannes-honored performance is that it's exhausting—all exterior, no soul, like watching an android run a gauntlet (one that includes grueling physical exertions, tendentious political speechifying, and risible Matt Damon cameos)". Slant magazine gave Che two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, [...] "The problem is that, despite his desire to sidestep Hollywood bio-hooey, the director is unable to turn his chilly stance into an ideological perspective, like Roberto Rossellini did in his demythologized portraits of Louis XIV, Garibaldi and Pascal".|$|E

Delany said she believed her character would be taken by surprise by the new feelings she is experiencing: [...] "I think that she’s still so emotionally vulnerable from getting out of the loony bin, and I think she and Robin connect on a kind of wounded, emotional level. And I think if anything, she’s feeling this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>emotional</b> solace with her, and that draws her to Robin in a physical way, and that’s confusing to her." [...] Delany and Benz were both sick when they filmed their kiss scene. Benz said of the scene, [...] "Dana's a great kisser."

Reviewing The Eraser for the NME, Louis Patterson praised Yorke's vocals and wrote: [...] "Some will mourn its lack of viscera; its coldness; its reluctance to rock. But it’s yet another revealing glimpse into Yorke's cryptic inner-world, and one that has the courage not to hide its political message in code." [...] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone said: [...] "These aren't Radiohead songs, or demos for Radiohead songs. They're something different, something we haven't heard before ... it's intensely beautiful, yet it explores the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>emotional</b> turmoil that makes the angst of [...] OK Computer or The Bends sound like kid stuff." [...] PopMatters wrote: [...] "The Eraser isn’t a masterpiece, but it’s much more than solo-project divergence. Yorke has stayed focused and created a tight album that draws on its predecessors without being held to or afraid of them." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract –Implementation {{of human}} {{cognitive}} abilities {{has become a}} key area of interest to robotic researchers as cognitive abilities {{are believed to be}} linked to high-level intelligent behaviors. In this paper, we associated emotions with stimuli to help the humanoid robot ISAC decide his action when responding to a particular situation. According to cognitive psychology, sound stimuli can create different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>emotional</b> response in humans. Therefore, we have designed ISAC to possess different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>emotional</b> response according to different sounds being perceived. Emotion, along with attention, are used by the decision making process to decide actions to be performed. Decisions are made based on the knowledge learned about the situations. The simulations in this paper show how these human cognitive abilities can be used to generate different responses to sound stimuli depending on the current situation.

[...] Though he felt the episode was weaker with its jokes, he noted that this [...] "is frequently the case in with episodes that deal more with the characters and less about making jokes in a wacky world.

He felt that throughout the fourth series Esther was used as [...] "simply a plot device, someone the writers used when they needed something to go wrong or when they needed the story to move in a certain direction."
