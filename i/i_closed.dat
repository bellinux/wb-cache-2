25|$|After the Bohemian King Joseph II's {{reforms in}} the 1770s the {{university}} became increasingly state-directed, while today it is a public university. During the Revolution of 1848 university students and professors played a very active role {{on the side of}} democratisation. The conservative king Francis Joseph <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> most of its faculties during the 1850s, but they were reopened by an act of the Interim National Assembly passed on 21 February 1946. This act also extended the name from University of Olomouc to Palacký University, Olomouc, naming it for František Palacký, a 19th-century Moravian historian and politician.|$|E
25|$|The Sasanian kings were enlightened {{patrons of}} letters and philosophy. Khosrau I had the works of Plato and Aristotle {{translated}} into Pahlavi taught at Gundishapur, and even read them himself. During his reign, many historical annals were compiled, of which the sole survivor is the Karnamak-i Artaxshir-i Papakan (Deeds of Ardashir), a mixture of history and romance {{that served as the}} basis of the Iranian national epic, the Shahnameh. When Justinian <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> the schools of Athens, seven of their professors fled to Persia and found refuge at Khosrau's court. In time they grew homesick, and in his treaty of 533 with Justinian, the Sasanian king stipulated that the Greek sages should be allowed to return and be free from persecution.|$|E
25|$|The {{university}} {{came out}} of the revolution as essentially bilingual (Czech and German) institution. In due course the university's support for the democratisation and the Czech National Revival brought retribution from the government in Vienna. In 1851, as the régime regained self-confidence, growing government intolerance of dissent and the subsequent decline in student numbers led to the closure of the Faculty of Philosophy. The Faculty of Law, which in 1849 had actually started teaching in the Czech language, was closed {{at the start of the}} 1855/56 academic year. In 1860 Emperor Franz Joseph <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> virtually the whole university. Only the independent Faculty of Theology and the independent University Library remained open, for nearly another eighty years, until, following the German invasion, all the Czech Universities were closed in November 1939. The School of Surgery also survived the emperor's decree in 1860, but closed in 1875.|$|E

25|$|Early in {{the morning}} {{somebody}} wakens me, I open my eyes and that's when my roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by Arab terrorists'. I knew him as a joker but that sounded too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, opened it and looked around. I have seen guards from the village and they were speaking to somebody that {{was standing in the}} entrance to apartment number one. I have noticed his dark skin and the hat and I listened, still without being afraid or thinking that something is very dangerous for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.' At that point I understood that something is going on and <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> the door.|$|E

From 425, the law school of Constantinople became a rival center of law study and was the only school, along with Beirut's, to be maintained after Justinian <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> those of Alexandria, Caesarea Maritima and Athens in 529 because their teachings contradicted with Christian faith.|$|E

500|$|In 1902 Loving {{was tapped}} to {{organize}} the Philippine Constabulary Band {{on the recommendation of}} Governor-General of the Philippines William Howard Taft, who had earlier heard Loving's 45th regimental band perform. Loving, who had learned both Spanish and Tagalog during his brief time in the Philippines, developed an instant rapport with his bandsmen. During the period in which Loving led the Philippine Constabulary Band it established a reputation for excellence both in the Philippines and the United States. The U.S. military periodical Army and Navy Life described the band as [...] "one of the finest of all military bands in the world," [...] while the Pacific Coast Musical Review, opined that [...] "the Philippine Constabulary Band is in a class by itself."

500|$|Less {{successfully}} {{during this}} period, Kneale completed screenplays for adaptations of the novels Lord of the Flies by William Golding and Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. Neither of these scripts ever saw production, as the companies making them {{went out of}} business—Kneale commented in a 2003 interview that [...] "I reckon <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> down at least two film companies." [...] Another screenplay that went unproduced was a Kneale original, a drama involving a wave of teenage suicides called The Big Giggle, or The Big, Big Giggle. Written in 1965 while Kneale was suffering from a mystery illness and forced to stay in bed for a long period, the concept started life as a drama serial for the BBC, before the corporation had second thoughts {{about the nature of}} the storyline and the possibility of copycat suicides; Kneale later agreed that they were probably right not to make it for television. The production was nearly made as a film by 20th Century Fox, but John Trevelyan, Chief Executive of the British Board of Film Censors, forbade the script's production.|$|E
500|$|... "Close My Eyes" [...] is a downtempo piano led song, {{which runs}} for a {{duration}} of four minutes and 19 seconds. The lyrical {{content of the}} song speaks indirectly about Carey's relationship with Mottola, and reflects on times in her life where she has had personal struggles and troubles. Her past {{is presented in the}} lyrics [...] "I was a wayward child, with {{the weight of the world}} that I held deep inside" [...] and [...] "Life was a winding road, and I learned many things little ones shouldn't know." [...] As described by David Browne for Entertainment Weekly, Carey [...] "paints herself" [...] in the lyrics as [...] "A wayward child, with the weight of the world". He also noted that the singer seems concerned that she had to grow up quicker than was perhaps necessary, in order to live her life in a controlled environment, [...] "Maybe I grew up a little too soon." [...] During the chorus, Carey lightens the mood of the song by singing about having courage to face times of adversity, [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> my eyes, steadied my feet on the ground, raised my head to the sky. And though times rolled by, still I feel like a child as I look at the moon. Maybe I grew up a little too soon."

2500|$|The Roman emperor Theodosius <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> the sanctuaries by decree about 30 years later, in 392 AD. The last {{remnants}} of the Mysteries were wiped out in 396 AD, when Arian Christians under Alaric, King of the Goths, destroyed and desecrated the old sacred sites. The closing of the Eleusinian Mysteries in the 4th century is reported by Eunapius, a historian and biographer of the Greek philosophers. Eunapius had been initiated by the last legitimate Hierophant, who had been commissioned by the emperor Julian to restore the Mysteries, which had by then fallen into decay. According to Eunapius, the very last Hierophant was a usurper, [...] "the man from Thespiae who held the rank of Father in the mysteries of Mithras." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Latin word sacerdos, [...] "priest," [...] is {{the same}} for both the {{grammatical}} genders. In Roman state religion, the priesthood of the Vestals was responsible for the continuance and security of Rome as embodied by the sacred fire that they could not allow to go out. The Vestals were a college of six sacerdotes (plural) devoted to Vesta, goddess of the hearth, both the focus of a private home (domus) and the state hearth that was the center of communal religion. Freed of the usual social obligations to marry and rear children, the Vestals took a vow of chastity in order to devote themselves to the study and correct observance of state rituals that were off-limits to the male colleges of priests. They retained their religious authority until the Christian emperor Gratian confiscated their revenues and his successor Theodosius <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> the Temple of Vesta permanently.|$|E

D'Or described an experience that he had singing at the festival as follows: [...] "I had a concert in the Canary Islands...in the WOMAD Festival in front of something like 20,000 people, and then I saw {{just in front of}} me, a group of Palestinian young people with a huge Palestinian flag. And at the beginning I was very tense because I didn't know what their intentions were. <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> my eyes and said 'Look, you speak always about the power of music and how music can get people close to each other', and I was like aiming to their heart, and I'm singing especially for them, and then when I opened my eyes and I saw those people dancing with the Palestinian flag and singing with me together, and it was for me like an amazing sight, because this is something that I don't think ever happened before.

2500|$|In 2005, Phoenix {{starred in}} the James Mangold {{directed}} film Walk the Line, a Johnny Cash biopic, after Cash himself approved of Phoenix. All of Cash's vocal tracks in the film and on the accompanying soundtrack are played and sung by Phoenix. The film was released on November 18, 2005, eventually grossing $186 million. Phoenix's performance received rave reviews from critics and it inspired film critic Roger Ebert to write, [...] "Knowing Johnny Cash's albums more or less by heart, <b>I</b> <b>closed</b> my eyes {{to focus on the}} soundtrack and decided that, yes, that was the voice of Johnny Cash I was listening to. The closing credits make it clear it's Joaquin Phoenix doing the singing, and I was gob-smacked". For his portrayal of [...] Johnny Cash, Phoenix was nominated for his second Academy Award, in the category of Best Actor as well as the BAFTA Award for Best Actor, Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role. He won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and the Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media for the film's soundtrack.
