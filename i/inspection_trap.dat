40|$|ObjectivesTo {{compare the}} {{sensitivity}} of inspections of cattle herds and adult fly trapping for detection of the Old World screw-worm fly (OWS). ProceduresThe incidence of myiases on animals {{and the number of}} OWS trapped with LuciTrap (R) /Bezzilure were measured concurrently on cattle farms on Sumba Island (Indonesia) and in peninsular Malaysia (two separate periods for the latter). The numbers of animal <b>inspections</b> and <b>traps</b> required to achieve OWS detection at the prevalent fly densities were calculated. ResultsOn Sumba Island, with low-density OWS populations, {{the sensitivity of}} herd <b>inspections</b> and of <b>trapping</b> for OWS detection was 0. 30 and 0. 85, respectively. For 95 % confidence of detecting OWS, either 45 inspections of 74 animals or trapping with 5 sets of 4 LuciTraps for 14 days are required. In Malaysia, at higher OWS density, herd inspections of 600 animals (twice weekly, period 1) or 1600 animals (weekly, period 2) always detected myiases (sensitivity = 1), while trapping had sensitivities of 0. 89 and 0. 64 during periods 1 and 2, respectively. For OWS detection with 95 % confidence, fewer than 600 and 1600 animals or 2 and 6 LuciTraps are required in periods 1 and 2, respectively. ConclusionsInspections of cattle herds and trapping with LuciTrap and Bezzilure can detect OWS populations. As a preliminary guide for OWS detection in Australia, the numbers of animals and traps derived from the Sumba Island trial should be used because the prevailing conditions better match those of northern Australia...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-Records from a {{two year}} period from over 24, 000 {{dwellings}} in the London Borough of Southwark were examined and infestations of German cockroaches, recorded by <b>inspection</b> and <b>trapping,</b> were analysed. Factors identified as possibly influencing infestation levels were block size {{and type of}} heating system, standard of hygiene in dwellings and human density in dwellings. The {{results indicate that the}} type of heating system does not have a major influence on cockroach infestation levels in small and medium blocks. However, with large blocks district heating was associated with higher levels of infestation. A relationship between cockroach infestation levels and the standards of hygiene in individual dwellings was established. Heavier levels of infestations were found in dwellings with poor standards of hygiene. Size of multi-occupancy block appeared to have no effect on levels of infestation, although there are implications for the persistence of infestation and difficulties for the implementation of control in very large blocks...|$|R

40|$|Certain insects affect cultivations in a {{detrimental}} way. A notable case is {{the olive}} fruit ﬂy (Bactrocera oleae (Rossi)), that in Europe alone causes billions of euros in crop-loss/per year. Pests can be controlled with aerial and ground bait pesticide sprays, the efficiency of which depends on knowing the time and location of insect infestations as early as possible. The <b>inspection</b> of <b>traps</b> is currently carried out manually. Automatic monitoring traps can enhance efficient monitoring of flying pests by identifying and counting targeted pests {{as they enter the}} trap. This work deals with the hardware setup of an insect trap with an embedded optoelectronic sensor that automatically records insects as they fly in the trap. The sensor responsible for detecting the insect is an array of phototransistors receiving light from an infrared LED. The wing-beat recording is based on the interruption of the emitted light due to the partial occlusion from insect’s wings as they fly in the trap. We show that the recordings are of high quality paving the way for automatic recognition and transmission of insect detections from the field to a smartphone. This work emphasizes the hardware implementation of the sensor and the detection/counting module giving all necessary implementation details needed to construct it...|$|R

The present study aimed at {{studying}} {{the abundance of}} wheat blossom midges WBM, Sitodoplosis mosellana (Géhin), Contarinia tritici (Kirby) and thrips, Li mothrips cerealium (Haliday) and Haplothrips tritici (Kurdjumov). Infestation in winter wheat during the growing seasons 2007, 2008 and 2009 was evaluated. Three methods {{were used to determine}} population densities and damage of wheat midges and thrips; pheromone <b>traps,</b> <b>inspection</b> of ear insects and water traps. A strong correlation between midge’s catches and weather conditions was obtained in field ob servations. A positive correlation between phe romone catches and ear infestation levels was recorded; it was higher in 2008 than in 2009. On the other hand, in 2007 there was no synchro nization; S. mosellana hibernated emerged too late to coincide with the susceptible wheat growth stages. The chemical treatment applied at 2008 for highly infestation; there were sig nificant differences in thrips and midge num bers between treated and untreated. Thrips and midge numbers were lower in the treated than in control. The high midge populations in water traps were recorded at growth stages 7779 and 83 and the low populations were recorded at GS 75 and 7577.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the field attractiveness of Thyanta perditor synthetic sex pheromone-baited traps, its attractivity to other stink bug species, and the response of T. perditor to a geometric isomer of the sex pheromone. Two-liter transparent plastic bottles traps were baited with rubber septa impregnated with the treatments: 1 mg of methyl-(2 E, 4 Z, 6 Z) -decatrienoate [(2 E, 4 Z, 6 Z) - 10 :COOMe], the male sex pheromone of T. perditor; 1 mg of (2 E, 4 Z, 6 Z) - 10 :COOMe protected from sunlight in standard PVC plumbing pipe; 1 mg of its geometric isomer [(2 E, 4 E, 6 Z) - 10 :COOMe]; and traps with rubber septa impregnated with hexane (control). The experiment {{was carried out in}} field during the soybean reproductive stages. Traps were monitored weekly, and the captures were compared to the population density estimated by the sampling cloth and visual <b>inspection</b> monitoring techniques. <b>Traps</b> baited with the sex pheromone, protected or not, were more effective in capturing T. perditor than traps baited with the isomer or the hexane. Thyanta perditor sex pheromone showed cross-attraction to other stink bug species, such as Euschistus heros, Edessa meditabunda, Piezodorus guildinii and Nezara viridula.

40|$|Monitoring dengue {{vector control}} by {{sampling}} adult Aedes aegypti (L.) recently {{has been used}} to replace both larval and pupal surveys. We have developed and evaluated the Gravid Aedes Trap (GAT) through a sequential behavioral study. The GAT does not require electricity to function, and trapped mosquitoes are identified easily during <b>trap</b> <b>inspections.</b> The GAT concept relies on visual and olfactory cues to lure gravid Ae. aegypti and an insecticide to kill trapped mosquitoes. Gravid mosquitoes are lured to a black bucket base containing oviposition attractant (infusion) and are trapped in a translucent chamber impregnated with a pyrethroid insecticide where they are killed within 3 - 15 min. In semifield observations, the GAT captured a significantly higher proportion of gravid mosquitoes than the double sticky ovitrap. We also demonstrated that the visual cues of the prototype GAT-LgBF (large black base bucket with a black funnel {{at the top of the}} translucent chamber) captured a significantly higher proportion of gravid mosquitoes than the other prototypes. The visual contrast created by the addition of a white lid to the top of the black funnel significantly increased the number of captured gravid mosquitoes when compared with the GAT-LgBF in semifield trials. We conclude that the GAT is more efficient in recapturing gravid Ae. aegypti when compared with sticky ovitraps. The GAT is an effective, practical, low cost, and easily transportable trap, features that are essential in large-scale monitoring programs, particularly in areas where funding is limited...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTINTRODUCTION: The {{transmission}} cycle of Trypanosoma cruzi in the Brazilian Pantanal region {{has been studied}} during the last decade. Although considerable knowledge is available regarding the mammalian hosts infected by T. cruzi in this wetland, no studies have investigated its vectors in this region. This study aimed to investigate the presence of sylvatic triatomine species in different habitats of the Brazilian Pantanal region and to correlate their presence with the occurrences of vertebrate hosts and T. cruzi infection. METHODS: The fieldwork involved passive search by using light traps and Noireau traps and active search by visual <b>inspection.</b> The light <b>traps</b> were placed at five selected points along forested areas for seven nights during each of the nine excursions. At each point where a light trap was set, eight Noireau traps were placed in palm trees and bromeliads. RESULTS: In all, 88 triatomine bugs were collected: two and one individuals from light traps and Noireau traps, respectively; three from peridomestic areas; 23 in coati nests; and 59 in thornbird nests. In this study, active search in microhabitats showed higher efficiency than passive search, since 95 % of the triatomine bugs were caught in nests. Further, triatomine bugs were only found to be infected by T. cruzi in coati nests. CONCLUSIONS: Coati nests might act {{as a point of}} convergence and dispersion for triatomine bugs and mammal hosts infected by T. cruzi, thereby playing {{an important role in the}} sylvatic cycle of T. cruziin the Pantanal region...|$|R
40|$|During the {{resettlement}} of 6500 persons living {{around the}} Nam Theun 2 hydroelectric project in Laos, more than 1200 pour-flush latrines were constructed. To assess {{the role of}} these latrines as productive larval habitats for mosquitoes, entomological investigations using Centers for Disease Control (CDC) light <b>traps,</b> visual <b>inspection</b> and emergence <b>trapping</b> were carried out in over 300 latrines during the rainy seasons of 2008 - 2010. Armigeres subalbatus (Diptera: Culicidae) were nine {{times more likely to}} be found in latrines (mean catch: 3. 09) than in adjacent bedrooms (mean catch: 0. 37) [odds ratio (OR) 9. 08, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 6. 74 - 15. 11] and mosquitoes were active in and around 59 % of latrines at dusk. Armigeres subalbatus was strongly associated with latrines with damaged or improperly sealed septic tank covers (OR 5. 44, 95 % CI 2. 02 - 14. 67; P < 0. 001). Armigeres subalbatus is a nuisance biter and a putative vector of Japanese encephalitis and dengue viruses. Dengue virus serotype 3 was identified from a single pool of non-blood-fed female A. subalbatus using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Maintaining a good seal around septic tanks by covering them with a layer of soil is a simple intervention to block mosquito exit/entry and contribute to vector control in resettlement villages. The scale-up of this simple, cheap intervention would have global impact in preventing the colonization of septic tanks by nuisance biting and disease-transmitting mosquitoes. </p...|$|R

40|$|Most of Australia’s {{agricultural}} produce is exported. Demonstrating freedom from certain {{plant and animal}} pests and diseases is critical to securing and maintaining market access. Surveillance is an important tool in gaining market access and accordingly exporting countries now need to provide accurate, credible evidence to confirm pest freedom status. In the past nearly all field-collected surveillance information was recorded manually to paper reducing the rate of capture, integrity, conformity as well as security of the data. This paper describes the development of pest surveillance data collection software and hardware using PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants) to provide auditing, validation, chain of evidence and increase the volume of data collected {{as well as its}} integrity through relational databases and seamless data transfer to corporate systems. The system’s first deployment was during a T. granarium eradication. The khapra beetle (Trogoderma granarium) {{is one of the most}} serious pests of stored grain and is a regulated quarantine pest in most countries around the world. In April 2007, there was a post-border detection of T. granarium larvae and adults in a Western Australian residence. Immediate and uncompromising action was taken to quarantine the home and fumigate it with methyl-bromide at an internationally established rate known to control T. granarium (AQIS T 9056). A two-year T. granarium trapping program was undertaken which used PDA software to provide evidence of complete eradication via 1273 <b>trap</b> <b>inspections.</b> This achievement was supported by GPSlocated traps, digital voice navigation itineraries, digital time and date stamps, field printed barcode labels, site imagery, all in a single hand-held unit...|$|R
40|$|Monitoring traps are {{important}} components of {{integrated pest management}} applied against important fruit fly pests, including Bactrocera oleae (Gmelin) and Ceratitis capitata (Widemann), Diptera of the Tephritidae family, which effect a crop-loss/per year calculated in billions of euros worldwide. Pests can be controlled with ground pesticide sprays, the efficiency of which depends on knowing the time, location and extent of infestations as early as possible. <b>Trap</b> <b>inspection</b> is currently carried out manually, using the McPhail trap, and the mass spraying is decided based on a decision protocol. We introduce the term 'insect biometrics' {{in the context of}} entomology as a measure of a characteristic of the insect (in our case, the spectrum of its wingbeat) that allows us to identify its species and make devices to help face old enemies with modern means. We modify a McPhail type trap into becoming electronic by installing an array of photoreceptors coupled to an infrared emitter, guarding the entrance of the trap. The beating wings of insects flying in the trap intercept the light and the light fluctuation is turned to a recording. Custom-made electronics are developed that are placed as an external add-on kit, without altering the internal space of the trap. Counts from the trap are transmitted using a mobile communication network. This trap introduces a new automated remote-monitoring method different to audio and vision-based systems. We evaluate our trap in large number of insects in the laboratory by enclosing the electronic trap in insectary cages. Our experiments assess the potential of delivering reliable data {{that can be used to}} initialize reliably the spraying process at large scales but to also monitor the impact of the spraying process as it eliminates the time-lag between acquiring and delivering insect counts to a central agency...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} oral anticoagulation on {{clotting}} during hemodialysis. BackgroundBetween 5 % and 10 % of hemodialysis patients {{are treated with}} oral anticoagulants. It is currently unknown whether additional anticoagulation with heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is needed to prevent clotting during hemodialysis. MethodsIn this prospective, randomized, cross-over study 10 patients treated with oral anticoagulants (phenprocoumon) received either no additional anticoagulation or low dose dalteparin (bolus of 40 IU/kg body weight) before dialysis. Efficacy of hemodialysis was measured by normalized weekly Kt/V and urea reduction rate (URR). Thrombus formation was evaluated by measurement of D-dimer and <b>inspection</b> of air <b>traps</b> and dialyser. ResultsThe median international normalized ratio (INR) did not differ between both observation periods (phenprocoumon 2. 2 (2 to 3) vs. dalteparin 2. 1 (2 to 2. 9). The anti-Xa level in dalteparin patients was 0. 33 (0. 27 to 0. 38) IU/mL after 2 hours and 0. 16 (0. 03 to 0. 23) IU/mL after 4 hours of hemodialysis. The median increase of D-dimer was significantly higher in patients without additional dalteparin therapy during hemodialysis (ΔD-dimer 0. 23 μg/mL vs. 0. 03 μg/mL) (P = 0. 0004). Complete thrombosis of the dialyser membrane occurred in one patient in the phenprocoumon group but in none with combined treatment. The extent of thrombosis in the arterial and venous air trap and dialyser was significantly less in patients with additional dalteparin therapy (P = 0. 0014,P = 0. 0002, andP = 0. 0005, respectively). Weekly Kt/V and URR was similar in both groups. ConclusionStandard oral anticoagulation with an INR between 2 and 3 is insufficient to prevent clotting during hemodialysis. Additional low dose anticoagulation with a LMWH or heparin is necessary to facilitate treatment...|$|R
40|$|Pherocon AM (PhAM) {{trapping}} {{and visual}} counting are two commonly used methods for identifying maize {{fields in the}} USA that contain {{a sufficient number of}} adult western corn rootworms (WCR), Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte to cause economic root damage by larvae the following year. Therefore, the estimation of adult WCR population {{plays an important role in}} management decisions (rotation or treatment). The goals of this study were (1) to compare adult WCR data obtained by PhAM trapping to “whole plant count” data in different maize developmental stages, (2) to determine the period in which the data obtained by both methods show the highest correlation, (3) to determine the regression curve between capture of WCR on PhAM as an independent variable and number of WCR observed by visual plant count, and (4) to determine if the “whole plant count” method can serve as a substitution for PhAM trapping under European conditions. Three samplings were conducted in 2006 in 38 fields in Croatia and one sampling was conducted in 22 fields in Serbia. Sampling in Croatia was conducted when maize plants were in the R 65 - 69, R 73 - 77 and R 79 - 85 developmental stages according to BBCH identification keys of maize. Sampling in Serbia was conducted when maize plants reached R 69 - 71 developmental stages. Three to six PhAM traps were placed in each 0. 5 to 4 ha maize field seven days prior to sampling. Visual counts were conducted on the same day as <b>trap</b> <b>inspections.</b> Adult WCR densities in the PhAM traps were correlated to adult densities on whole plants. Statistical analyses comparing the results of PhAM trapping with the visual “whole plant count” method showed that there is a significant medium to strong correlation between them. Correlation coefficients varied depending on the data used in the analysis. When sampling was conducted in the first half of August (maize developmental stages R 69 - 77), the correlation coefficients were the highest (r (R 6971) = 0. 8677 and r (R 73 - 77) = 0. 706). Coefficients of determination were the highest as well [r 2 (R 69 - 71) = 0. 753; r 2 (R 73 - 77) = 0. 4984]. Therefore, the most appropriate period for sampling is during the first half of August. At that time, the majority of the maize plants were between the R 69 and R 77 developmental stages. According to the results, 0. 5 – 1 visually determined adult/plant corresponds to 40 adults/trap/week. This shows that both methods are equally useful for estimating the population densities of WCR in the Central European region...|$|R
