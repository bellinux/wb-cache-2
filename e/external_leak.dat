50|$|A leaking {{head gasket}} can be {{classified}} as either external or internal. An <b>external</b> <b>leak</b> can be identified as oil and coolant accumulating underneath the engine. The presence of coolant can be detected by shining a black light on {{what appears to be}} an oil leak; the appearance of coolant will show up under the black light. External leaks can also appear as previously described in the oil. An internal leak can usually be diagnosed by excessive coolant accumulating in the expansion tank along with the presence of hydrocarbons in the form of foam. The possibility of vapors or condensation and/or water (from the road or rain) building up (in aftermarket product installation) from an external breather or catch tank from the head (rocker cover) can also cause a buildup of froth or foam in the oil but is highly unlikely.|$|E
40|$|When {{it comes}} to {{evaluating}} traditional computational leak detection technologies pipeline operators have a suite of simulated testing methods available. In {{the last several years}} however <b>External</b> <b>Leak</b> Detection Technologies have become more mature and potentially could provide operators with another layer of leak detection with more sensitivity than seen in traditional methods. The challenge with these technologies is in the evaluation of their sensitivity, reliability, and robustness. ENBRIDGE INC (Enbridge) and C-FER Technologies 1999 Inc. (C-FER) begun a comprehensive study to assess the state-of-the-art external, continuously distributed sensors for leak detection in early 2012. Initially, a technology review was undertaken to identify commercial, off-the-shelf technologies with the potential to detect small leaks of oil from buried pipelines. From this literature review, four technologies were identified; Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS), Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS), Vapor Sensing Tubes (VST), and Hydrocarbon Sensing Cables (HSC). All four methods require proprietary materials and technology, which have had limited independent testing efforts to date. To evaluate these four leak detection methods and their vendors in an objective way, Enbridge and C-FER initiated the design and construction of a large-scale <b>External</b> <b>Leak</b> Detection Experimental Research apparatus (ELDER) that can accommodate a full-size segment of pipeline within a trench, at the same scale used in pipeline construction in North America. An instrumented pipe segment is buried in the trench with sensing cables laid alongside. The apparatus generates leaks with controlled variables including rate, pressure and temperature, and at various locations to accurately represent pipeline leaks. This paper summarizes the literature review on the four selected leak detection technologies that were identified as candidates for large-scale evaluation. The discussion will also include features of the ELDER apparatus, and re-engineered pipeline construction techniques that were required to accurately represent a full-scale pipeline trench within a laboratory environment.

40|$|The International Space Station (ISS) and all {{currently}} conceivable future {{manned spacecraft}} {{are susceptible to}} mission impacts due to fluid/gas leaks to the exterior environment. For example, there is a well-known risk of ammonia leaks from the ISS External Thermal Control System loops and currently no method to locate them. It was, therefore, critical to develop a method for detecting and locating leaks to preserve vehicle health. The Robotic <b>External</b> <b>Leak</b> Locator (RELL) was developed and deployed to the ISS to provide this capability.

40|$|Measurement System Analysis helps, {{along with}} {{statistical}} methods, provide deep {{knowledge about the}} capability of a company’s measurement system. Through {{a better understanding of}} how measurement systems perform, companies can base decisions on facts to promote quality work.  This study examines the capabilities of Measurement System Analysis and examines how well a test bench performs while testing motors at Bosch Rexroth AB in Mellansel. The study examines both the repeatability and the reproducibility of the measurement system, i. e., the variability that occurs when the same operator is doing repeated measurements on the same motor and when different operators perform measurements on the same motor.  Bosch Rexroth AB manufactures high torque hydraulic motors. The case study covered the motor type CA 50, which is the most produced motor today at the company. The tests were made at one of the two existing test benches. The DMAIC method within Six Sigma was selected to get a structured workflow in the case study.  Three parameters were examined for the motor type CA 50 – high pressure, <b>external</b> <b>leaks,</b> and cleanliness – and touched on Destructive Testing. It was clear from the Measurement System Analysis that the operators did not have a significant impact on the variability of the motor tests for any of the three parameters. The precision of the measurement system differed between the parameters. Concerning the parameter high pressure, the measurement system could be considered to be acceptable, but with room for improvement. The parameter <b>external</b> <b>leaks</b> showed an excellent measurement system with strong margins. The parameter cleanliness, however, showed an unacceptable measurement system.  The capability study regarding the same three parameters showed different results. The parameter high pressure showed a decent capability (C_pk^ = 1. 17). Parameter <b>external</b> <b>leaks</b> showed a high capability (C_pk^ = 1. 17), but cleanliness showed a poor capability (C_pk^ = 1. 09, 1. 0 respectively 1. 13) for the three different particle sizes 4 µm, 6 µm and 14 µm.  This thesis resulted in four main suggestions for improvement concerning both the test bench facility and motor type CA 50. The recommendations could help reduce the uncertainty in the measurements of the parameter cleanliness and the precision of the parameter high pressure. Furthermore, the thesis presents a suggestion on how outliers of parameter high pressure might be handled and suggestions for adjusted tolerances on the parameter <b>external</b> <b>leaks.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|A new {{carbon dioxide}} {{scrubber}} system is undergoing development for extended duration orbiter (EDO) missions. The EDO requirements of missions up to 18 {{days and the}} capability for future missions up to 30 days necessitated {{the development and implementation}} of a regenerative CO 2 removal process. This new system will reduce the launch weight and stowage volume as compared to the present method of CO 2 removal, lithium hydroxide, which is stowed in canisters. The selected design, called the Regenerable CO 2 Removal System (RCRS), uses a solid amine material to adsorb carbon dioxide and water vapor and periodically desorb these to space vacuum. The RCRS, which is located below the middeck floor, interfaces with the orbiter's cabin Atmospheric Revitalization System and is adjustable from four to seven crewmembers.

More than 3000 m^ 2 of RPC {{system was}} successfully operated with a closed loop gas system in the first three-running-years of the LHC. Annual campaigns were done during 2011 and 2012 to measure the gas leak rates of the RPCs and the results were compared to the flow-cell readout data. The total leak rate on the barrel increased between 2011 and 2012 while the total rate on the endcaps was negligible during the same period. Consequently, the CMS gas consumption increased, but the gas leaks could not be repaired during the whole period of the data taking at the LHC that lasted more than two years.

40|$|London Ltd is {{used for}} {{sampling}} respirable dusts on to either 37 or 25 mm diameter filters. Potential leak problems using the 25 mm holder have been investigated here. Two sources of leaks may cause errors: (1) <b>external</b> <b>leaks</b> into the grit pot, or into the 25 mm filter holder, allow air to by-pass the cyclone {{and as a result}} large particles which should be removed by it are deposited directly on the filter, so that the amount of respirable dust in the air is overestimated; and (2) internal leaks due to a poor seal between the filter and the holder by-pass the filter and result in the respirable dust concentration being underestimated. A crude check for <b>external</b> <b>leaks</b> can be made by placing a finger over the cyclone inlet. The pump should stall if there are no leaks. If there is a gross leak, e. g. a split in the rubber grit pot, the pump will not be loaded and this can be readily heard.

40|$|The {{energetics}} {{of neutral}} and branched chain amino acid transport by membrane vesicles from Streptococcus cremoris {{have been studied}} with a novel model system in which beef heart mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase functions as a proton-motive force (Δp) generating system. In the presence of reduced cytochrome c, a large Δp was generated with a maximum value at pH 6. 0. Apparent H+/amino acid stoichiometries (napp) have been determined at external pH values between 5. 5 and 8. 0 from the steady state levels of accumulation and the Δp. For L-leucine napp (0. 8) was nearly independent of the pH. For L-alanine and L-serine napp decreased from 0. 9 - 1. 0 at pH 5. 5 to 0 - 0. 2 at pH 8. 0. The napp for the different amino acids decreased with increasing external amino acid concentration. At pH 6. 0, first order rate constants for amino acid exit (kex) under steady state conditions for L-leucine, L-alanine, and L-serine were 1. 1 - 1. 3, 0. 084, and 0. 053 min- 1, respectively. From the pH dependence of kex it is concluded that amino acid exit in steady state {{is the sum of}} two processes, pH-dependent carrier-mediated amino acid exit and pH-independent passive diffusion (<b>external</b> <b>leak).</b> The first order rate constant for passive diffusion increased with increasing hydrophobicity of the side chain of the amino acids. As a result of these processes the kinetic steady state attained is less than the amino acid accumulation ratio predicted by thermodynamic equilibrium. The napp determined from the steady state accumulation represents, therefore, a lower limit. It is concluded that the mechanistic stoichiometry (n) for L-leucine, L-alanine, and L-serine transport most likely equals 1. ...|$|E

40|$|Ballard Power Systems is {{a leading}} company {{in the field of}} {{hydrogen}} fuel cell research and manufacture. Monitoring membrane deterioration through excessive crossover requires accurate hydrogen leak sensors within the vehicle safety systems. Hydrogen sensors are typically used to detect fuel crossover and <b>external</b> <b>leaks</b> in fuel cells. They are expensive and have typically exhibited short lifetimes. Two methods of lengthening the sensor life have been examined in this thesis. The first is physical filtering of poisoning agents. These components, particularly the siloxane compounds that are off-gassed from the silicone tubing, coalesce {{on the surface of the}} hydrogen sensor as silicates, reducing the sensor sensitivity. With these compounds mostly removed by the filters, the sensor life has been extended. While preventing degradation of the cathode exhaust sensor is the best approach, it was not wholly effective. Significant effort went into recalibrating the hydrogen sensor in situ, the second method. This methodology uses anode and cathode mass flow sensors in the fuel cell to automatically calibrate the hydrogen sensor as it degrades. The results from this approach were found to be promising, and we showed that the auto-calibration algorithm was robust enough to accept disturbances in system inputs...|$|R

They are exposed to extremely high doses of ionizing radiation. In the past, the magnets experienced two catastrophic failures due to overheating of its coils and cannot be repaired. The magnets of improved design which is subject of this article are built as replacements for the magnets presently installed. The MNP- 23 is a resistive C shaped iron-dominated magnet made of solid low carbon steel blocks. The excitation windings consist of two water-cooled coils wound from hollow copper conductor. The septum design of these magnets implies a high current density which requires an efficient water cooling system. The newly designed cooling circuit provides better cooling performance and more reliability. To avoid failures due to coil overheating, an elaborate interlock system was developed and installed.

30|$|Secular {{variation}} studies generally {{deal with}} observatory annual means and/or with repeat station {{data that are}} reduced {{to the middle of}} the measurement year. There is also a tendency to use monthly averages (e.g. Alexandrescu et al., 1995), but, we think, with increased possibilities for <b>external</b> effects to <b>leak</b> into the models. The presence in annual mean data of a solar-cycle-related (SC) signal due to incomplete averaging out of external effects, modulated by the solar activity, has long been recognized (Chapman and Bartels, 1940; Yukutake, 1965; Bhargava and Yacob, 1969; Alldredge, 1975, 1976; Courtillot and Le Mouël, 1976; Alldredge et al., 1979; Yukutake and Cain, 1979; Demetrescu et al., 1988; Verbanac et al., 2007; Wardinski and Holme, 2011). Because at the observing point these effects comprise both the direct and the induced fields, and having in view the frequency difference of the SC variation in comparison to the secular variation, a suitable filter applied to data would eliminate both the external fields and their induced effects. Recent works (Korte and Holme, 2003; Thébault, 2008; Verbanac et al., 2009) use a quite different way to deal with the external signal, modeling the internal field from data by means of a spherical cap harmonic analysis (SCHA). We think that the problem of <b>external</b> effects <b>leaking</b> into the main field model, which we discuss in the present paper in relation with global field models, might be a problem for the SCHA too.|$|R

Materials and Methods. Twenty-seven IACs were inoculated with E. coli endotoxin. Six of the twenty-seven IACs were external connections from one system (Southern Implants) and the remaining twenty-one IACs were made up of seven internal IAC types from four different implant companies (Straumann, Ankylos, and Neodent, Southern Implants).

40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} of the thermodynamic {{state of the}} cryogenic propellants in launch vehicle tanks is necessary for mission planning and successful execution. Cryogenic propellant storage and transfer in space environments requires that tank pressure be controlled. The pressure rise rate {{is determined by the}} complex interaction of <b>external</b> heat <b>leak,</b> fluid temperature stratification, and interfacial heat and mass transfer. If the required storage duration of a space mission is longer than the period in which the tank pressure reaches its allowable maximum, an appropriate pressure control method must be applied. Therefore, predictions of the pressurization rate and performance of pressure control techniques in cryogenic tanks are required for development of cryogenic fluid long-duration storage technology and planning of future space exploration missions. This paper describes an analytical tool, Tank System Integrated Model (TankSIM), which can be used for modeling pressure control and predicting the behavior of cryogenic propellant for long-term storage for future space missions. It is written in the FORTRAN 90 language and can be compiled with any Visual FORTRAN compiler. A thermodynamic vent system (TVS) is used to achieve tank pressure control.

Despite these technological challenges, {{there is a}} completely new world of physics which can be explored once low temperatures are achieved. To reach such ultra-low temperatures, we implemented a parallel network of Nuclear Refrigerators, to adapt magnetic cooling to electronic transport measurements. The cooling scheme relies on the cooling of each individual lead by its own nuclear refrigerator to transfer cooling power down to the sample. Here, we present {{the implementation of a}} parallel network of nuclear refrigerators {{for the first time on}} a cryo-free system. One challenge is the increased vibrations level compared to the wet cryostat, but a careful damping of the vibrations is possible, thus enabling low temperature experiments.

Some parts of the air from the heater go to the channel, other parts are sucked through a pithead by the general shaft pressure drawdown formed by the main ventilation installation (MVI).

The problem of energy saving while airing underground mining enterprises is also very important. The proposed solution of both tasks due to the application of an air curtain is described in the article.

It’s recommended to use an air curtain in a ventilation shaft because it reduces <b>external</b> air <b>leaks</b> thereby improving energy efficiency of the MVI work. During the mathematical modeling of ventilation and air preparation process (in SolidWorks Flowsimulation software package) it was found out that the use of the air curtain in the air supply shaft can increase the efficiency of the AHI, and reduce the electricity consumption for ventilation in the ventilation shaft...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Acoustic {{emission}} (AE) can {{be generated}} {{by a number of}} different fault conditions in pipes, including localized fluid-mechanical disturbances, such as local impingement or erosion, growing fatigue cracks or crack face rubbing, <b>external</b> impacts and <b>leaks,</b> each of which may have its own temporal and frequency characteristics. In this paper, a linear array of sensors is applied with the ultimate aim of locating and reconstituting the time-domain and frequency-domain signatures of AE sources in pipes. Experiments have been carried out with a simulated source on sections of line pipe and process pipe using a linear array. The acquired signals have two identifiable components and methods are demonstrated for separating these components automatically and determining their group velocities. A range of techniques, including a wavelet transform technique, a cross-correlation technique, and a filtering and thresholding technique are applied to obtain arrival times for variousmodes of the signal. Finally, methods are proposed for giving automatic source location in large length–diameter ratios with an accuracy of better than 5 per cent...|$|R
40|$|Corrosion {{in steel}} has been {{identified}} as one of the major problem in chemical industry which responsible for substantive plant shutdown that contributes to high maintenance costs especially in pipelines system. In addition contamination of products and process streams, and <b>external</b> corrosion <b>leaks</b> due to internal corrosion failures can create unfortunate safety, manpower and environmental jeopardy. In order to overcome this problem, certain techniques have been applied {{and one of the most}} practical ways is using inhibitor to protect metals against corrosive environment. Commercial and synthetic inhibitors are commonly used and have been proved to be effective in inhibiting corrosive attack on metal but most of these inhibitors are toxic and expensive thus become major setback. To alleviate this issues, researcher were focused on eco-friendly corrosion inhibitor using natural and biodegradable compound which is effective, low cost and low environmental impact. Pineapple peels is cheap abundant resource in Malaysia, and hence this work presents corrosion inhibitor studies using pineapple (Ananas comosus L.) peels extract. Corrosion rates were determined using weight loss method for three parameters; concentration of inhibitor, acid concentration and exposure time. Pineapple peels extract was analysed by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer to determine the chemical composition in the extracts which has the inhibition functions. The extract proved to contains oleic acid and octadenoic acid which have carbonyl group and double bonds. These characteristics mostly found in plant extract which can inhibit corrosion The weight loss method was conducted according to the standard provided by ASTM. The corrosion rate of steel was found to be dependent on acid concentration and also extract concentration. Another factor is exposure time which contributes to the value of corrosion rate. Results from this work may be useful to study the efficiency of this inhibitor using more parameters as this will become alternative for commercial inhibitor...|$|R
