30|$|However, {{since it}} is {{difficult}} to accurately control the type, number, and location of a defect in a <b>fabricated</b> <b>part,</b> the fatigue strength of a part can be in jeopardy. Therefore, the fatigue strength of an SLM <b>fabricated</b> <b>part</b> is still questionable and needs to be improved.|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, the SLM {{process has}} a {{directional}} {{effect on the}} properties of the forming parts due to its basic deposition principle. The directional effect is a direct cause of the severe anisotropy in the mechanical properties of the <b>fabricated</b> <b>part.</b> For a part fabricated based on the orthogonal scan strategy shown in Fig.  13, defects may be formed and distributed in the horizontal direction, resulting in the obvious reduction of the load-bearing cross-section area in the <b>fabricated</b> <b>part</b> [66]. If the loading direction coincides with the building direction, the part is more susceptible to failure, leading to a low strength of the part [24, 37, 67]. In addition, because of the epitaxial growth in the SLM process, the elongated columnar grains in the <b>fabricated</b> <b>part</b> also aggravate anisotropy of the part [28, 34].|$|E

30|$|Since defect {{formation}} {{is a critical}} issue in an SLM process, research has been directed towards understanding and suppression of defect formation [7, 24 – 36]. This paper reviews the recent research outcomes on the types and formation mechanisms of the common SLM defects, such as porosities, incomplete fusion holes, and cracks. The paper also reveals how the SLM defects may affect the mechanical properties of a <b>fabricated</b> <b>part.</b> Other defects, such as metallic inclusions, segregations, residual stresses, metallurgical imperfections may also {{have a significant impact}} on the mechanical properties of a <b>fabricated</b> <b>part,</b> their respective formation mechanisms will be reviewed in a separate paper and published elsewhere. Finally, the paper provides a reference for defect suppression and control in the SLM processes.|$|E

30|$|Although the SLM process {{offers a}} great {{advantage}} in manufacturing complex parts {{at a high}} material utilization rate [15], it is affected by many factors, such as laser energy input and scan speed, scan strategy, powder material, powder size and morphology. The SLM process consists of complicated physics, such as absorption and transmission of laser energy [16], rapid melting and solidification of material, microstructure evolution [17, 18], flow in a molten pool [19], and materials evaporation [20]. The process is thus affected by the aforementioned factors to form defects of porosities, incomplete fusion holes, cracks, and impurities, etc. These defects are detrimental to a <b>fabricated</b> <b>part</b> {{in terms of its}} mechanical and physical properties, which in turn limits the application of SLM [21 – 24].|$|E

40|$|AbstractHigh local {{temperature}} gradients occur at additive manufacturing by {{selective laser melting}} of powder. This gives rise to undesirable residual stresses, deformations, and cracks. To understand how to control {{the formation of the}} residual stresses, a reliable method is necessary for measuring their distribution in the <b>fabricated</b> <b>part.</b> It is proposed to cut the part into thin plates and to reconstruct the residual stresses from the measured deformation of the plates. This method is tested on beams with square cross-section built from stainless steel. The beams were cut by electrical discharge machining and chemically etched. The obtained stress profile in vertical transversal direction slightly increases from the top {{to the bottom of the}} beam. This dependency is confirmed by numerical modeling.

30|$|In the SLM process, a laser {{selectively}} melts {{the metal}} powders point by point, line by line, and layer by layer {{to complete the}} whole part. If the laser energy input is low, {{the width of the}} molten pool is small, which results in an insufficient overlap between the scan tracks. The insufficient overlap is a cause of formation of the un-melted powders between the scan tracks. In the deposition process of a new layer, it becomes difficult to fully re-melt these powders. As a consequence, incomplete fusion holes are formed and remain in the SLM <b>fabricated</b> <b>part.</b> Furthermore, if the laser energy input is too low to cause an enough penetration depth of the molten pool, LOF defects may be generated due to a poor interlayer bonding [24, 29, 37]. Therefore, LOF defects are usually distributed between the scan tracks and the deposited layers.|$|E
30|$|Firstly, if {{the packing}} density of metal powders is low, e.g., 50 percent, the gas present between the powder {{particles}} may dissolve in the molten pool. Because of the high cooling rate during the solidification process, the dissolved gas cannot {{come out of the}} surface of the molten pool before solidification takes place. Porosities are thus formed and remain in the <b>fabricated</b> <b>part.</b> Porosities may also be formed when metal powders of a hollow structure are utilized in an SLM process. On the other hand, the molten pool temperature is generally high due to the intense laser power. At this temperature, gas solubility in the liquid metal is high, making its enrichment easier. Furthermore, in the process of preparing powder materials, gas is inevitably introduced into the powder materials, especially the gas atomized powder materials in the scope of protection by an inert gas, such as argon or helium.|$|E
