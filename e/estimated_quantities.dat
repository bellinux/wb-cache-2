40|$|Temporary Traffic Control Plans (TCP’s), {{which provide}} {{construction}} phasing to maintain traffic during construction operations, are integral component of highway construction project design. Using the initial design, designers develop <b>estimated</b> <b>quantities</b> for the required TCP devices that {{become the basis}} for bids submitted by highway contractors. However, actual as-built quantities are often {{significantly different from the}} engineer’s original estimate. The total cost of TCP phasing on highway construction projects amounts to 6 – 10 % of the total construction cost. Variations between engineer <b>estimated</b> <b>quantities</b> and final quantities contribute to reduced cost control, increased chances of cost related litigations, and bid rankings and selection. Statistical analyses of over 2000 highway construction projects were performed to determine the sources of variation, which later were used as the basis of development for an automated-hybrid prediction model that uses multiple regressions and heuristic rules to provide accurate TCP quantities and costs. The predictive accuracy of the model developed was demonstrated through several case studies...|$|E

40|$|Remote sensing {{of grass}} {{quantity}} {{is important for}} providing information about the productivity and functioning of rangelands. Existing indices used to <b>estimate</b> grass <b>quantity,</b> such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are of limited value due to the saturation problem, especially in dense vegetation with 100 % leaf area cover. Therefore, there is need to explore new techniques to resolve the saturation problem. In this study we tested the utility of band depth analysis to <b>estimate</b> grass <b>quantity</b> in dense vegetation. Band depth indices calculated from continuum-removed spectra of Cenchrus ciliaris grass, measured at canopy level in the visible spectral domain (550 ¿ 750 nm) were used to estimate biomass. Band depth analysis results were compared to two narrow band NDVIs calculated using near-infrared and red bands. Results indicate that, the band depth analysis methodology could <b>estimate</b> <b>quantity</b> with a high coefficient of determination of 0. 81, 0. 83, 0. 86 and 0. 85 for band depth (BD), band depth ratio (BDR), normalized band depth index (NBDI) and band depth normalized to area (BNA), respectively. Narrow band NDVIs yielded lower correlations (0. 31 and 0. 32 for NDVI 1 and NDVI 2, respectively). Thus, band depth can <b>estimate</b> <b>quantity</b> in densely vegetated areas where NDVI values reach an asymptote...|$|R

One therapeutic radiopharmaceutical where patient-specific dosimetry is feasible is 177 Lu-DOTATATE, used for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumours.

One important step for dosimetry using this imaging technique is the SPECT image segmentation, which needs to be robust and accurate for the <b>estimated</b> <b>quantities</b> to be reliable.
