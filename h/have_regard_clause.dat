40|$|This paper {{argues that}} both human translators and machine {{translation}} systems can greatly benefit from contrastive studies of text structure. Due {{to the great}} terminological and definitional confusion regarding structures in texts, the paper first discusses the main viewpoints on these issues and then outlines the two most significant differences between Italian and Danish text structure. One regards the notion of information density: Italian tends to accumulate the same information in shorter text spans and to include {{a larger number of}} Elementary Discourse Units in each sentence than Danish. The other <b>regards</b> <b>clause</b> linkage: A higher percentage of Italian clauses is morpho-syntactically and rhetorically subordinated by means of non-finite and nominalised verb forms. Danish text structure, on the other hand, is more informationally linear and characterised by a higher number of finite verbs and topic shifts. These typological differences are transferred into some simple translation rules concerning the number of Elementary Discourse Units per sentence and their textualisation. Each rule is illustrated by a number of examples taken from the parallel part of the Europarl Corpus. 1 Introduction...|$|R

40|$|Butkiewicz, James L. This paper empirically {{investigates the}} impact of {{national}} fiscal rules in the economic growth of developing countries, and supranational fiscal rules on the growth of developing countries which are currency union members. Using the recent IMF 2013 fiscal rule database, a standard neo-classical growth model with short-run dynamics is estimated for 17 developing countries and three currency unions: the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union, the Central African Economic and Monetary Community and the West African Economic and Monetary Union. System GMM, Difference GMM and Dynamic Fixed Effects estimates suggest that {{the impact of}} national fiscal rules on growth is positive, but they are inconclusive when it comes to statistical significance. However, the evidence is slanted toward an insignificant effect implying so that fiscal rules do not matter. Moreover, when national fiscal rules are present with formal enforcement procedures or any mechanisms outside the government that monitor the compliance of rules, the differential effect of fiscal rules with enforcement has a negative effect on growth, decreasing the magnitude of the total positive effect of fiscal rules with enforcement. This is likely due to the governments’ behavior in developing countries which when faced with a binding budget constraint; they tend to reduce public investment rather than current expenditures. However, even when rules <b>have</b> exclusion <b>clauses</b> <b>regarding</b> public investment or any other priority items, their impact on growth is negative as these types of rules create incentives for “creative accounting” techniques. Nevertheless, whether the effect of fiscal rules with enforcement or fiscal rules with exclusions is significant cannot be determined. As a result, developing countries should not be following blindly advanced economies when regulating their fiscal policies. On the other hand, there is evidence that the presence of supranational fiscal rules in currency union members has a positive and significant impact on the economic growth of these countries.

Extending our data to 1999, we find no evidence of such changes but, rather, the same pattern as before: collective-action clauses raise costs of borrowing for low-rated issuers but reduce them for issuers with high credit ratings. We drop a special case [...] Israel - - and show that this has no impact on the results. And we show that the same results hold for sovereign borrowers alone. We argue that these results should reassure those who <b>regard</b> collective action <b>clauses</b> as an important element in the campaign to strengthen the international financial architecture. ...|$|R
