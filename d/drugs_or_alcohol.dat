25|$|Those who are {{cheated on}} {{experience}} {{a great amount}} of anxiety, stress and depression. Shrout (2017) was among researchers who conducted a study based on the hypothesis that people experiencing those emotions because of an infidelity are {{more likely to engage in}} activities that are a health risk (1). Health-compromising behaviors such as depriving themselves of food and nutrients, consuming alcohol or using drugs more often, increased sexual activity, having sex under the influence of <b>drugs</b> <b>or</b> <b>alcohol</b> or over-exercising.|$|E
25|$|Shrout and {{her team}} in Reno’s initial {{hypothesis}} was proven: not only do victims of infidelity experience emotional trauma, but that trauma leads to more risky actions or behaviors. In addition to the behaviors first examined, such as depriving themselves of food and nutrients, consuming alcohol or using drugs more often, increased sexual activity, having sex {{under the influence of}} <b>drugs</b> <b>or</b> <b>alcohol</b> or over-exercising, people also felt a loss of trust that expands beyond romantic relationships.

25|$|Why {{the freight}} train failed to stop was unclear. A wrong-side signal problem was eliminated, leaving human error {{as the only}} {{possible}} cause.

Enough of their remains were found that testing was able to rule out <b>drugs</b> <b>or</b> <b>alcohol</b> as the cause, though it was revealed that the engineer, Jack Hudson, was an alcoholic and heavy smoker suffering from pancreatitis and type 2 diabetes, thus placing him at risk for a heart attack or stroke.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{possible}} outcomes on {{the conclusion of}} a first date. The two individuals may agree to a second date. One or both parties may decide that there were compatibility issues and decide not to pursue further dates. Compatibility factors vary a great deal, and can include religion, whether or not a person uses <b>drugs</b> <b>or</b> <b>alcohol,</b> appearance, or personality. Alternatively, the two parties may decide to become friends or some other type of Platonic relationship (a non-sexual relationship). Some first dates may lead to a romantic relationship that can range in duration from short period to a long period.|$|E
25|$|In total, {{the victim}} had been stabbed over 150 {{times in the}} neck, chest and torso with a common pen knife; some of these wounds had severed her carotid artery.

She had not {{been the victim of}} a robbery or any form of sexual assault prior to her murder, and had no <b>drugs</b> <b>or</b> <b>alcohol</b> in her system when she died.

25|$|Bulimia nervosa, {{also known}} as simply bulimia, is an eating {{disorder}} characterized by binge eating followed by purging. Binge eating refers to eating {{a large amount of}} food in a short amount of time. Purging refers to the attempts {{to get rid of the}} food consumed. This may be done by vomiting or taking laxatives. Other efforts to lose weight may include the use of diuretics, stimulants, water fasting, or excessive exercise. Most people with bulimia are at a normal weight. The forcing of vomiting may result in thickened skin on the knuckles and breakdown of the teeth. Bulimia is frequently associated with other mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and problems with <b>drugs</b> <b>or</b> <b>alcohol.</b> There is also a higher risk of suicide and self-harm.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} high-quality performance, some musicians take chemical substances. Some musicians take <b>drugs</b> <b>or</b> <b>alcohol</b> {{to deal with the}} stress of performing. As a group they have a higher rate of substance abuse. The most common chemical substance which is abused by pop musicians is cocaine, because of its neurological effects. Stimulants like cocaine increase alertness and cause feelings of euphoria, and can therefore make the performer feel as though they in some ways ‘own the stage’. One way in which substance abuse is harmful for a performer (musicians especially) is if the substance being abused is aspirated. The lungs are an important organ used by singers, and addiction to cigarettes may seriously harm the quality of their performance. Smoking causes harm to alveoli, which are responsible for absorbing oxygen.|$|E
25|$|An {{inquiry into}} the {{accident}} by the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC) concluded that the balloon pilot made an error of judgement when contact with the power lines became imminent, trying to out-climb the power lines rather than using the rapid descent system to drop the balloon quickly to the ground below. Toxicology analysis of the balloon pilot after the accident tested positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), suggesting {{he may have been}} under the influence of cannabis {{at the time of the}} crash, which ultimately led to the error of judgement. The crash was the sixth accident in ten years the TAIC had investigated (the TAIC also investigates marine and rail accidents) which involved key people testing positive for <b>drugs</b> <b>or</b> <b>alcohol,</b> and the commission has called for the Government to enact stricter measures in regards to drug and alcohol use in the aviation, marine and rail industries.|$|E
