In June 2013 it was announced that Bin He had developed the technique to enable a remote-control helicopter to be guided through an obstacle course.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a short {{introduction}} to a special ICMI session on brain-computer interaction. During this paper, we first discuss problems, solutions, and a five-year view for brain-computer interaction. We then talk further about unique issues with multimodal and hybrid <b>brain-computer</b> <b>interfaces,</b> which could help address many current challenges. This paper presents some potentially controversial views, which will hopefully inspire discussion about the different views on <b>brain-computer</b> <b>interfacing,</b> how to embed <b>brain-computer</b> <b>interfacing</b> in a multimodal and multi-party context, and, more generally, how to look at <b>brain-computer</b> <b>interfacing</b> from an ambient intelligence point of view...|$|R

40|$|For {{people living}} with paralysis, {{restoration}} of hand function remains the top priority because it leads to independence and improvement in quality of life. In approaches to restore hand and arm function, a goal is to better engage voluntary control and counteract maladaptive brain reorganization that results from non-use. Standard rehabilitation augmented with developments {{from the study of}} <b>brain-computer</b> <b>interfaces</b> could provide a combined therapy approach for motor cortex rehabilitation and to alleviate motor impairments. In this paper, an adaptive <b>brain-computer</b> <b>interface</b> system intended for application to control a functional electrical stimulation device is developed as an experimental test bed for augmenting rehabilitation with a <b>brain-computer</b> <b>interface.</b> The system’s performance is improved throughout rehabilitation by passive user feedback and reinforcement learning.
