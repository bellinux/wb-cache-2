5|$|The muscle of the {{esophagus}} in many mammals is striated initially, but then becomes smooth muscle in the caudal third or so. In canines and ruminants, however, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>entirely</b> striated to allow regurgitation to feed young (canines) or regurgitation to chew cud (ruminants). <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>entirely</b> smooth muscle in amphibians, reptiles and birds.|$|E
5|$|A {{beaked whale}} is any {{of at least}} 22 species of small whale in the family Ziphiidae.

Six genera have been identified.|$|E

5|$|Scientists and U.S. {{courts have}} {{rejected}} this objection {{on the grounds}} that science is not based on appeals to popularity, but on evidence. The scientific consensus of biologists determines what is considered acceptable science, not popular opinion or fairness, and although evolution is controversial in the public arena, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>entirely</b> uncontroversial among experts in the field.|$|E

5|$|Early in Ahmedabad's history, under Ahmed Shah, {{builders}} fused Hindu craftsmanship with Persian architecture, {{giving rise}} to the Indo-Saracenic style. Many mosques in the city were built in this fashion. Sidi Saiyyed Mosque {{was built in the}} last year of the Sultanate of Gujarat. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>entirely</b> arched and has ten stone latticework windows or jali on the side and rear arches. Private mansions or haveli from this era have carvings. A Pol is a typical housing cluster of Old Ahmedabad.|$|E

5|$|Camouflage for {{aircraft}} {{is complicated by}} the fact that the aircraft's background varies widely, depending on the location of the observer, the nature of the background and the aircraft's motion. For this reason, military aircraft were often painted to match the sky when viewed from below, and to either match the ground or break up the aircraft's outline when viewed from above. This is a form of countershading, likely to work best on aircraft such as heavy bombers that do not do fly inverted during combat. Because of the way light hits it, patterns of dark and light will often be present on an aircraft even if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>entirely</b> one color, making it easier to see Reflections and specular highlights can be counteracted by painting an aircraft in neutral shades with a non-reflective, matte finish. There is a trade-off between the effectiveness of camouflage and the size of recognition markings: larger markings reduce the risk of friendly fire through misrecognition, but compromise camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Triton's {{surface is}} covered with a {{transparent}} layer of annealed frozen nitrogen. Only 40% of Triton's surface has been observed and studied, but it is possible that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>entirely</b> covered in such a thin sheet of nitrogen ice. Like Pluto's, Triton's crust consists of 55% nitrogen ice with other ices mixed in. Water ice comprises 15–35% and frozen carbon dioxide (dry ice) the remaining 10–20%. Trace ices include 0.1% methane and 0.05% carbon monoxide. There could also be ammonia ice on the surface, as there are indications of ammonia dihydrate in the lithosphere. Triton's mean density implies that it probably consists of about 30–45% water ice (including relatively small amounts of volatile ices), with the remainder being rocky material. Triton's surface area is 23millionkm2, which is 4.5% of Earth, or 15.5% of Earth's land area. Triton has a considerably and unusually high albedo, reflecting 60–95% of the sunlight that reaches it, and it has changed slightly since the first observations. By comparison, the Moon reflects only 11%. Triton's reddish colour is thought {{to be the result of}} methane ice, which is converted to tholins under exposure to ultraviolet radiation.|$|E
