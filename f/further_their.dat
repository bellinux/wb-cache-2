5|$|In 831, Mojmir I was baptized, and his Moravian state {{became a}} part of the Bavarian Passau diocese. Aiming to achieve ecclesiastical as well as {{political}} independence from East Frankish influence, his successor Rastislav asked the Byzantine emperor Michael III for missionaries. As a result, Cyril and Methodius arrived in Moravia in 863 and commenced missionary activities among the Slavic people there. To <b>further</b> <b>their</b> goals, the brothers developed a written Slavic liturgical language: Old Church Slavonic, which employed the Glagolitic alphabet created by them. They translated the Bible and other church texts into this language, thus establishing a foundation for the later Slavic Eastern Orthodox churches.|$|E

5|$|Israeli {{historian}} David Tal {{agreed with}} this view; Yoav Gelber, {{when asked about}} this, commented that {{the significance of the}} attack, along with two other major tactical failures—Latrun and Jenin—was {{in the fact that the}} initiative passed to the Israeli side, and the Arabs conducted only small assaults after these operations.

5|$|Knott's {{most notable}} {{action as a}} {{legislator}} occurred {{near the end of}} his first stint in Congress. On January 27, 1871, he delivered a satirical speech ridiculing a bill that would have provided fifty-seven land grants and financial concessions to railroads to <b>further</b> <b>their</b> westward expansion. In the speech, Knott singled out the Bayfield and St. Croix Railroad's proposed line from the St. Croix River to Duluth, Minnesota to make his point. He derided the remoteness of the town and the need for a railroad to it by repeatedly referring to a map and asking where Duluth was located. Following the speech, the railroad bill was killed and Congress adjourned for the day.|$|E

5|$|Plutarch's {{account of}} the revolt {{suggests}} that the slaves simply wished to escape to freedom, and leave Roman territory by way of Cisalpine Gaul. Appian and Florus describe the revolt as a civil war, in which the slaves intended to capture the city of Rome itself. The Third Servile War had significant and far-reaching effects on Rome's broader history. Pompey and Crassus exploited their successes to <b>further</b> <b>their</b> political careers, using their public acclaim and the implied threat of their legions to sway the consular elections of 70 BC in their favor.

While completing his studies at Mariëndaal in Grave, he was separated from much of the world and spent his time in introspection. He completed his novitiate on 22September 1922 and was initiated into the Jesuits, taking their oath of poverty, chastity and obedience.|$|E
5|$|The romantic {{nationalism}} that Tod espoused {{was used}} by Indian nationalist writers, especially those from the 1850s, as they sought to resist British control of the country. Works such as Jyotirindranath Tagore's Sarojini ba Chittor Akrama and Girishchandra Ghosh's Ananda Raho retold Tod's vision of the Rajputs in a manner to <b>further</b> <b>their</b> cause.

5|$|After the Square Enix merger, {{however, the}} {{individual}} teams still continued to program and customize their own tools for each game, which would eventually {{go to waste}} as only their respective creators {{knew how to use}} them. With the amount of assets and tools required by the in-development Final Fantasy XII and the impending advent of the seventh console generation, a common data format for the company was proposed in 2004. It was to be developed in-house and replace general-purpose formats such as FBX and COLLADA. Realizing the goal of an engine with a common set of tools proved to be difficult, as many production teams wanted to <b>further</b> <b>their</b> own interests rather than those of the company as a whole. Select staff members from different company divisions teamed up to work on the project on a voluntary basis, but their loose organizational structure failed to yield results. Nevertheless, Murata considered this group effort a first step in the right direction. In 2005, he was appointed general manager of the newly formed Technology Division. Although this enabled Murata and his subordinates to talk about a company-wide engine more extensively, the lack of manpower again prevented any significant achievements.|$|E
5|$|As {{they travel}} across the war-torn land, they are confronted by avatars {{in the service}} of {{multiple}} nations, and Arca - a cult made up of avatars led by a woman known as Mathias. Chitose joins Arca to <b>further</b> <b>their</b> cause of a utopia for avatars, and tries to persuade Luca to join, causing a rift between them. The conflicts between the groups is further inflamed as more people regain their memories as warriors of Sensus or Ratio, sparking old conflicts. In their adventures, the group works to end the fighting and learn about their past lives. When the full truth is revealed, they decide to fulfill Asura's wishes and unite the two worlds. This brings them into conflict with Mathias, who is revealed to be the incarnation of Asura's wrath at being betrayed, and now wishes to destroy both Devaloka and Naraka. Chitose, consumed by Sakuya's love for Asura, helps Mathias in her task. The party confront Mathias and Chitose in Devaloka's ruined capital, where the Manifest is hidden. They defeat Mathias, and Chitose kills herself in a fit of despair. Luca then proceeds to use the Manifest to merge Devaloka and Naraka, nullifying the avatars' powers and lessening the chance of future conflicts. The group then returns to their normal lives.|$|E
5|$|In 1768, {{civil war}} {{broke out in the}} Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, when the Bar Confederation sought to depose King Stanisław August Poniatowski. One of Kościuszko's brothers, Józef, fought {{on the side of the}} insurgents. Faced with a {{difficult}} choice between the rebels and his sponsors—the King and the Czartoryski family, who favored a gradualist approach to shedding Russian domination—Kościuszko chose to leave Poland. In late 1769, he and a colleague, the noted artist Aleksander Orłowski, were granted royal scholarships, and on October 5 they set off for Paris. They wanted to <b>further</b> <b>their</b> military education, but as foreigners they were barred from enrolling in French military academies, and so they enrolled instead in the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. There Kościuszko pursued his interest in drawing and painting and took private lessons in architecture from the noted French architect Jean-Rodolphe Perronet.|$|E

5|$|Like Daniel, most {{party members}} came from pietist churches, and most were former Republicans. Elected {{as the head}} of the Maryland branch of the party, he {{attended}} the 1884 Prohibition Party National Convention in Pittsburgh. After being selected as temporary chairman of the convention, the delegates chose Daniel to be nominated for vice president alongside the presidential nominee, John St. John. The party platform was silent on most issues of the day, focusing instead on the alcohol problem. In the election that year, the Prohibition ticket fell far short of victory, as expected, but placed third with 1.5 percent of the vote—a marked improvement over the 0.1 percent the 1880 Prohibition candidates had received. <b>Further,</b> <b>their</b> vote total in New York—just over 25,000—was more than enough to throw the election in that state from James G. Blaine, the Republican, to Grover Cleveland, the Democrat. Because pro-temperance voters usually voted Republican, many historians credit St. John and Daniel with costing Blaine the election.|$|E

5|$|Pope Innocent III {{also began}} preaching {{what became the}} Fourth Crusade in 1200, {{primarily}} in France but also in England and Germany. After gathering in Venice, the Crusade was used by Doge Enrico Dandolo and Philip of Swabia to <b>further</b> <b>their</b> secular ambitions. Dandolo's aim was to expand Venice's power in the Eastern Mediterranean, and Philip intended to restore his exiled nephew, Alexios IV Angelos, along with Angelos's father, Isaac II Angelos, to the throne of Byzantium. This would require overthrowing the present ruler, Alexios III Angelos, the uncle of Alexios IV. When an insufficient number of knights arrived in Venice, the Crusaders were unable to pay the Venetians for a fleet, so they agreed to divert to Constantinople and share what could be looted as payment. As collateral, the Crusaders seized the Christian city of Zara; Innocent was appalled, and promptly excommunicated them. However, the French Crusaders eventually had their excommunications lifted. When the original purpose of the campaign was defeated by the assassination of AlexiosIV Angelos, they conquered Constantinople, not once but twice. Following upon their initial success, the Crusaders captured Constantinople again and this time sacked it, pillaging churches and killing many citizens. The Fourth Crusade never came within 1,000 miles of its objective of Jerusalem.|$|E
