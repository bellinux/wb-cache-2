40|$|Abstract: The {{detonation}} of {{energetic materials}} {{will result in}} the formation of <b>decomposition</b> <b>products.</b> These may be carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, carbon, water, etc. In order to clarify the problems of <b>decomposition</b> <b>products,</b> a software package is developed to solve the problems of <b>decomposition</b> <b>products</b> using four different concepts. Although each concept will provide a different answer for the <b>decomposition</b> <b>products</b> they {{can be used as a}} guide and give fairly good approximations. This paper describes the development of a software package to estimate the possible <b>decomposition</b> <b>products</b> and the results generated using the software package LION. An algorithm to compute the detonation products of energetic materials using four different concepts along with the computation of oxygen balance, elemental composition, and molecular weight has been developed and described in this paper. The concept or predicting possible detonation products is particularly useful as one of the guideline for screening the potential molecules, when formulating explosives to produce a minimum toxic fumes to reduce the toxic hazardous to the users...|$|R
40|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{investigation}} of the thermal degradation process of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBA). The use of combined experimental techniques allowed the quantitative characterization of TBBA decomposition products and the analysis of the thermal degradation rates. The distribution of bromine among the different decomposition product fractions was investigated. In the open configuration used for the experiments, hydrogen bromide, brominated bisphenol A species, and brominated phenols resulted in the main decomposition products. Bromine was mainly evolved as hydrogen bromide, although a relevant quantity resulted present in the primary high molecular weight condensable product fraction, in agreement with the decomposition pathways proposed. The results evidenced that accidents involving TBBA thermal degradation, such as fire or process runaways, may pose relevant safety problems because of the possible release of considerable quantities of <b>hazardous</b> <b>decomposition</b> <b>products...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{studies the}} decomposition of folpet fungicide under oxidative conditions and compares the product species {{with those of}} captan fungicide, which is structurally related to folpet. Toxic products arising from folpet comprised carbon disulfide (highest emission factor of 4. 9 mg g - 1 folpet), thiophosgene (14. 4), phosgene (34. 1), hydrogen cyanide (2. 6), tetrachloroethylene (111), hexachloroethane (167), and benzonitrile (4. 5). Owing to their related molecular structures, folpet emitted similar products to captan but at different yields, under the same experimental conditions. It appears that the availability of easily abstractable H atoms, {{in the structure of}} captan but not in that of folpet, defines the product distribution. In conjunction with the quantum chemical calculations, these experimental measurements afford an enhanced explanation of the formation pathways of <b>hazardous</b> <b>decomposition</b> <b>products</b> of these two structurally related fungicides...|$|E
40|$|Refrigerant R 32 (difluoromethane, formula CH 2 F 2) is {{a working}} fluid with {{favorable}} environmental and performance properties. However, {{it can be}} slightly flammable under certain conditions (13 – 30 % by volume in air), with a flammability classification of 2 L. The risks of ignition, fire, and <b>hazardous</b> <b>decomposition</b> <b>products</b> are being assessed in our laboratories using experiments, risk analysis, and computational fluid dynamics simulations. R 32 has entered service in Japan and is being considered for service in the US. Its adoption is being hindered by its slight flammability in air. Past research has examined the flammability of pure refrigerants without considering {{the effects of the}} presence of lubricating oil. The concentration of oil released in a refrigerant leak can vary depending on the location of the leak and the operating state of the equipment. In this study, mixtures of R 32 and R 410 with lubricating oil are impinged onto a hot horizontal metal surface to examine autoignition behavior. The tests simulate a leak in a cooling system that impinges on a heating element. The hypothesis of this research is that the autoignition behavior of these mixtures is dominated by the presence of lubricating oil, not by differences in the refrigerant flammability. Only preliminary results are available at the time of abstract preparation, but extensive results will be included in the presentation at Purdue...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 Graphite oxides {{which had}} been {{prepared}} from three different size graphite particles by the modified Brodie method were observed with the electron microscope. The thermal <b>decomposition</b> <b>products</b> of the oxides, obtained by heating them at 240 ° and 300 °, were observed using the electron microscope and x-ray diffraction.

X-ray diffraction patterns of the <b>decomposition</b> <b>products</b> allow the qualitative evaluation {{of the change in}} the composition of the various samples.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{decomposition}} {{characteristics of a}} new type of environmentally friendly insulating gas C 6 F 12 O and N 2 mixed gas under AC voltage. The breakdown behavior of 3 % C 6 F 12 O and N 2 mixed gas in quasi-uniform field was investigated through a breakdown experiment. The self-recovery of the mixed gas was analyzed by 100 breakdown experiments. The <b>decomposition</b> <b>products</b> of C 6 F 12 O and N 2 under breakdown voltage were determined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometer (GC-MS). Finally, the decomposition process of the products was calculated by density functional theory, and the ionization energy, affinity, and molecular orbital gap of the <b>decomposition</b> <b>products</b> were also calculated. The properties of the <b>decomposition</b> <b>products</b> were analyzed from the aspects of insulation and environmental protection. The experimental results show that the 3 % C 6 F 12 O and N 2 mixed gas did not show a downward trend over 100 breakdown tests under a 0. 10 MPa breakdown voltage. The <b>decomposition</b> <b>products</b> after breakdown were CF 4, C 2 F 6, C 3 F 6, C 3 F 8, C 4 F 10, and C 5 F 12.

40|$|The fungitoxicity {{of carbon}} {{disulfide}} (CS 2), methylisothiocyanate (MITC), or {{a mixture of}} these two gases, to selected wood-degrading fungi was studied by using a fumigation apparatus. Both gases are important <b>decomposition</b> <b>products</b> of metham sodium, {{the most commonly used}} fumigant for internal treatment of large wood members. Carbon disulfide (up to 8, 000 - 9, 000 ppm) was mildly toxic to most of the test fungi, and MITC (up to 18 ppm) was uniformly toxic. A combination of sublethal levels of both gases (3, 000 - 4, 000 ppm CS 2 / 5 ppm MITC) was more toxic than either chemical alone. The results suggest a synergism between various metham sodium <b>decomposition</b> <b>products,</b> and this interaction may account for the protection afforded by this treatment.
