40|$|ABSTRACT: Future {{launch vehicle}} payload {{fairings}} will be manufactured from advanced lightweight composite materials. The loss of distributed mass causes {{a significant increase}} in the <b>internal</b> <b>acoustic</b> environment, causing a severe threat to the payload. Using piezoelectric (PZT) actuators to control the fairing vibration and the <b>internal</b> <b>acoustic</b> environment has been proposed. To help determine the acoustic control authority of piezoelectric actuators mounted on a rocket fairing, the <b>internal</b> <b>acoustic</b> response created by the actuators needs to be determined. In this work the <b>internal</b> <b>acoustic</b> response of a closed simply-supported (SS) cylinder actuated by PZT actuators is determined using an impedance model for the actuator and boundary element analysis. The experimentally validated model is used to extrapolate results for a SS cylinder that emulates a Minotaur payload fairing. The <b>internal</b> cylinder <b>acoustic</b> levels are investigated for PZT actuation between 35 and 400 Hz. Significant reductions in the structural response due to increased damping do not equate to similar reductions in the acoustic sound pressure levels (SPLs) for the cylinder. The sound levels at the acoustic resonant frequencies are essentially unaffected by the significant increase in structural damping while the acoustic levels at the structural resonant frequencies are mildly reduced. The interior acoustic response of the cylinder is dominated by the acoustic modes and therefore significant reductions in the overall interior acoustic levels will not be achieved if only the structural resonances are controlled. As the actuation frequency is reduced, the number of actuators required to generate acoustic levels commensurate to that found in the fairing increases to impractical values. Below approximately 100 Hz, the current demands reach levels that are extremely difficult to achieve with a practical system. The results of this work imply that PZT actuators do not have the authority to control the payload fairing <b>internal</b> <b>acoustics</b> below 100 Hz...|$|R

40|$|Local active {{noise control}} systems aim to produce zones of quiet {{at a number of}} desired {{locations}} within a sound field, such as the ears of an observer. The resulting zones of quiet are usually centered at the error sensors, and are often too small to extend from the error sensors to the observer’s ears. To overcome these problems, virtual sensing methods have been suggested. These methods are based on estimat-ing the error signals at a number of locations remote from the physical locations of the error sensors. By minimising the estimated error signals, the zones of quiet can be moved away from the error sensors to the locations where noise control is de-sired, i. e. the virtual locations. In this paper, the {{active noise control}} problem under consideration is analysed using a state-space model of the plant.
