5|$|The {{fossil record}} in this member shows the base was {{dominated}} by deposit <b>feeders,</b> while the upper layers were dominated by filter <b>feeders.</b> This can be correlated to the lithology: the finer sediments of the shales {{at the base of}} this member would contain abundant adherent organic matter for deposit <b>feeders,</b> but would tend to foul the gills of filter <b>feeders</b> when suspended; the coarser sediments of the sandstones at the top would have contained less organic matter to support deposit <b>feeders.</b>|$|E
5|$|Filter <b>feeders</b> are {{molluscs}} {{that feed}} by straining suspended matter and food particle from water, typically by passing the water over their gills. Most bivalves are filter <b>feeders.</b>|$|E
5|$|Digestion {{starts in}} buccal cavity (mouth) as {{partially}} chewed food is {{broken down by}} saliva from the salivary glands. As the salivary glands produce fluid and carbohydrate-digesting enzymes (mostly amylases), strong muscles in the pharynx pump fluid into the buccal cavity, lubricating the food like the salivarium does, and helping blood <b>feeders,</b> and xylem and phloem <b>feeders.</b>|$|E

2500|$|There {{were three}} streams used as feeders: Rocky Run <b>feeder</b> (section #9, around 7 Locks), Great Falls <b>feeder</b> (section #18) and the Tuscarora <b>feeder</b> (section #78). There was a {{contemplated}} <b>feeder</b> at the Monocacy (not built). Of course, {{the remains of}} the Potomac Company Little Falls skirting canal was used as a <b>feeder</b> also.

40|$|A wedged plane-flow hopper and {{horizontal}} belt <b>feeder</b> is employed {{to investigate the}} flow patterns and stress field redistribution at the hopper and <b>feeder</b> interface. The flow patterns are recorded by a high speed camera in conjunction with coloured material layers. The three-dimensional stress field in the feed zone and its influence on the <b>feeder</b> operation are discussed. The vertical stresses acting on the <b>feeder</b> for initial filling and flow conditions are measured along with longitudinal shear <b>feeder</b> loads. The experimental results are compared with theoretical values derived using relevant <b>feeder</b> load theories. The influences of different filling heights and clearance between the hopper bottom and <b>feeder</b> surface on <b>feeder</b> loads are presented. Numerical simulations using the Discrete Element Method (DEM) are carried out additionally to analyse <b>feeder</b> loads at hopper and <b>feeder</b> interface, the results being compared with those obtained experimentally...|$|R
5|$|The {{majority}} of species are surface <b>feeders,</b> obtaining food {{that has been}} pushed to the surface by other predators or currents, or have floated in death. Among the surface <b>feeders</b> some, principally the gadfly petrels, can obtain food by dipping from flight, {{while most of the}} rest feed while sitting on the water. These surface <b>feeders</b> are dependent on their prey being close to the surface, and for this reason procellariids are often found in association with other predators or oceanic convergences. Studies have shown strong associations between many different kinds of seabirds, including wedge-tailed shearwaters, and dolphins and tuna, which push shoaling fish up towards the surface.|$|E
5|$|Medium {{to large}} seabirds with grey, {{white and black}} plumage, webbed feet and strong bills. Many are {{opportunistic}} and adaptable <b>feeders.</b> There are about 56 species worldwide, 16 {{of which have been}} recorded in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|Nectar <b>feeders</b> such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets amongst {{others have}} {{specially}} adapted brushy tongues {{and in many}} cases bills designed to fit co-adapted flowers. Kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates; shorebirds' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches. Loons, diving ducks, penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater, using their wings or feet for propulsion, while aerial predators such as sulids, kingfishers and terns plunge dive after their prey. Flamingos, three species of prion, and some ducks are filter <b>feeders.</b> Geese and dabbling ducks are primarily grazers.|$|E

5|$|Eschrichtiids {{have one}} living member: the grey whale. They are bottom <b>feeders,</b> mainly eating {{crustaceans}} and benthic invertebrates. They feed by turning {{on their sides}} and taking in water mixed with sediment, which is then expelled through the baleen, leaving their prey trapped inside. This is an efficient method of hunting, in which the whale has no major competitors.|$|E

5|$|In {{almost all}} layers {{arthropods}} {{are the most}} abundant and diverse group of fossils in the GPB, followed by sponges. 69.2% of GPB individuals and 63.9% of species lived {{on the surface of}} the sea bed; within this group, mobile deposit <b>feeders</b> that extracted food particles from the sediment accounted for 38.2% of the total number of individuals and 16.8% of the total species; the smallest sub-group was mobile hunters and scavengers; and the rest were sessile suspension <b>feeders.</b> Animals that lived in the sediment made up 12.7% of the species and 7.4% of the individuals; the largest sub-group was mobile hunters and scavengers. Bottom-dwelling animals capable of swimming comprised 12.7% of species and 7.4% of individuals. Organisms that spent their whole life swimming were very rare, accounting for only 1.5% of individuals and 8.3% of species.|$|E
5|$|Isopods are detritivores, browsers, {{carnivores}} (including {{predators and}} scavengers), parasites, and filter <b>feeders,</b> and may occupy {{one or more}} of these feeding niches. Only aquatic and marine species are known to be parasites or filter <b>feeders.</b> Some exhibit coprophagia and will also consume their own fecal pellets. Terrestrial species are in general herbivorous, with woodlice feeding on moss, bark, algae, fungi and decaying material. In marine isopods that feed on wood, cellulose is digested by enzymes secreted in the caeca. Limnoria lignorum, for example, bores into wood and additionally feeds on the mycelia of fungi attacking the timber, thus increasing the nitrogen in its diet. Land-based wood-borers mostly house symbiotic bacteria in the hindgut which aid in digesting cellulose. There are numerous adaptations to this simple gut, but these are mostly correlated with diet rather than by taxonomic group.|$|E

In winter, {{in the northern part}} of its range, the finch may move nearer to <b>feeders</b> if they are available. In southern ranges, during winter, they remain in areas similar to the fields and flood plains where they live during the summer months.|$|E
40|$|This NebGuide {{describes}} the ten USDA <b>feeder</b> cattle grades. The {{purpose of the}} USDA <b>Feeder</b> Cattle Grades is to sort <b>feeder</b> cattle into similar groups that will facilitate their selling and buying. These grades {{can also be used}} for sorting <b>feeder</b> cattle into similar outcome groups in a feedlot. Differences in frame size and muscle thickness score are the basis for the USDA <b>Feeder</b> Cattle Grades. <b>Feeder</b> cattle are given a grade score that is coded for both frame size (large, medium and small) and thickness (1, 2 and 3). For example, a large frame, thick <b>feeder</b> steer would have a <b>feeder</b> grade of 2 ̆ 2 L- 1, 2 ̆ 2 indicating a large frame, number 1 muscle thickness. <b>Feeder</b> grades consisting of frame size and thickness will only apply to normal, healthy animals.

5|$|Sewage outfalls {{into the}} lake are {{proposed}} to be completely stopped by the interception and diversion of feeder lines. Lining the main <b>feeders</b> {{into the lake}} and setting up water treatment plants to continuously treat and recirculate the lake water are also envisioned. Conservation measures proposed for adoption to clean the lake are by way of desilting and deweeding, water treatment at inlet of <b>feeders</b> into the lake, construction of check dams, conservation of ghats, afforestation of denuded hills in the catchment, soil moisture conservation measures, stabilization of sand dunes by planting vegetation of suitable species of plants and restriction of cultivation {{in the bed of}} feeder channels. In addition, the institutional measures considered for effecting improvement of the lake are mass awareness programmes with the population's participation as well as the control of fish proliferation {{to reduce the risk of}} death of fishes during periods of inadequate water depth in the lake.|$|E
5|$|Surface <b>feeders</b> that swim {{often have}} unique bills as well, adapted for their {{specific}} prey. Prions have special bills with filters called lamellae {{to filter out}} plankton from mouthfuls of water, and many albatrosses and petrels have hooked bills to snatch fast-moving prey. Gulls have more generalised bills that reflect their more opportunistic lifestyle.|$|E

5|$|There are {{substantial}} fossil records of jawed fishes across the K–Pg boundary, which provide good evidence of extinction patterns of these classes of marine vertebrates. While {{the deep sea}} realm was able to remain seemingly unaffected, there was an equal loss between the open marine apex predators and the durophagous demersal <b>feeders</b> on the continental shelf.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{earliest}} temnospondyls were primarily semiaquatic, {{they had the}} ability to feed on land. Later, eryopoids and dissorophoids, some well adapted to terrestrial life, also fed on land. Some eryopoids became better adapted toward life in water, and shifted their diets toward aquatic organisms. The first primarily aquatic <b>feeders</b> were archegosaurs in the Permian. Trematosaurs and capitosaurs became independently aquatic and also returned to this type of feeding.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{are found}} on all continents except Antarctica, {{and only a}} few large islands, such as Greenland, Iceland, parts of Polynesia and the Hawaiian Islands lack native ant species. Ants occupy a wide range of {{ecological}} niches and exploit many different food resources as direct or indirect herbivores, predators and scavengers. Most ant species are omnivorous generalists, but a few are specialist <b>feeders.</b> Their ecological dominance is demonstrated by their biomass: ants are estimated to contribute 15–20% (on average and nearly 25% in the tropics) of terrestrial animal biomass, exceeding that of the vertebrates.|$|E
