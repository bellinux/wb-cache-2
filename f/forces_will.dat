5|$|Tyrion Lannister and Varys {{walk through}} the streets, which are largely empty because of Daenerys's absence and fear of the Sons of the Harpy. Tyrion observes that Daenerys' enemies are growing, {{including}} former slaves and former masters. Varys promises that his spies will find {{the leader of the}} Sons of the Harpy. The two discover that someone has set fire to all of the ships in Meereen's harbor, and Tyrion realizes that Daenerys's <b>forces</b> <b>will</b> be unable to sail to Westeros.|$|E
5|$|Adding to Sparrow's woes, Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) of the East India Trading Company has a {{personal}} score to settle with Sparrow. Beckett wants the chest and <b>forces</b> <b>Will</b> Turner to search for Sparrow and his magic compass. Turner locates Sparrow and his crew on Pelegosto, held captive by cannibals who intend to eat Sparrow. They escape, and voyage to Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris) (a magical woman later revealed to be the Goddess, Calypso, bound in human form as Dalma, and former lover of Jones). Dalma immediately sees destiny in Will, and provides Sparrow with a jar of dirt - Jones can only set foot on land once every 10 years, and since land is where Sparrow is safe, Dalma suggests with the dirt that he takes land with him.|$|E
50|$|Thus, for {{sufficiently}} large driving forces, {{the interface}} can move uniformly {{without the benefit}} of either a heterogeneous nucleation or screw dislocation mechanism. What constitutes a sufficiently large driving force depends upon the diffuseness of the interface, so that for extremely diffuse interfaces, this critical driving <b>force</b> <b>will</b> be so small that any measurable driving <b>force</b> <b>will</b> exceed it. Alternatively, for sharp interfaces, the critical driving <b>force</b> <b>will</b> be very large, and most growth will occur by the lateral step mechanism.|$|R

5|$|During {{the course}} of the game, Argentine airstrikes will {{frequently}} sink Royal Navy ships, depending on how many of them were initially allocated to defensive positions. In addition, Argentine air <b>forces</b> <b>will</b> occasionally bomb and destroy British forces on the ground, which are represented as animated sprites on the map. The map also displays terrain details, including rivers and mountains. If troops are situated on top of a mountain, they will receive a defensive bonus once attacked; however, due to the steep terrain, they will move more slowly. If the player chooses to enter an enemy-controlled zone, the move will instantly end, leaving the unit vulnerable to an Argentine attack.|$|E
5|$|In Norse mythology, Vígríðr or Óskópnir {{is a large}} field foretold to host {{a battle}} between {{the forces of the}} gods and the forces of Surtr as part of the events of Ragnarök. The field is attested in the Poetic Edda, {{compiled}} in the 13th century from earlier traditional material, and in the Prose Edda, written by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century. The Poetic Edda briefly mentions the field as where the two <b>forces</b> <b>will</b> battle, whereas the Prose Edda features a fuller account, foretelling that it is the location of the future death of several deities (and their enemies) before the world is engulfed in flames and reborn.|$|E
5|$|The nation {{employs a}} professional, {{volunteer}} military force of approximately 79,000 active personnel and 32,250 reserve personnel. The unified Canadian Forces (CF) comprise the Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Navy, and Royal Canadian Air Force. In 2013, Canada's military expenditure totalled approximately C$19billion, or around 1% of the country's GDP. Following the 2016 Defence Policy Review, the Canadian government announced a 70% increase to the country's defence budget {{over the next}} decade. The Canadian <b>Forces</b> <b>will</b> acquire 88 fighter planes and 15 naval surface combatants, the latter {{as part of the}} National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy. Canada's total military expenditure is expected to reach C$32.7billion by 2027.|$|E

30|$|The {{frictional}} <b>force</b> <b>will</b> {{be changed}} depending on surface slipperiness, {{and the floor}} reaction <b>force</b> <b>will</b> be changed depending on the surface hardness of the floor. This means that the information of surface hardness and slipperiness for surface description can be acquired by measuring the frictional force and floor reaction force.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The rolling <b>force</b> <b>will</b> {{directly}} have {{influence on}} the size of high-neck flange and whether the rolled part will be shaped successfully. Finite element model of closed ring rolling high-neck flange was established, the effect of process parameters on rolling force and its reasons are analyzed. The results show that, the higher feeding speed is, the larger the amplification of rolling <b>force</b> <b>will</b> be, in addition, rolling <b>force</b> <b>will</b> be reduced slightly with the increase of rotational speed of driving roller, and the {{influence on the}} rolling force of compressing roller’s feeding speed is much larger than driving roller’s rotational speed...|$|R
5|$|The {{second level}} {{of the game is}} in Beirut, and focuses on the player, along with a group of Navy Seals, rescuing hostages in a 3D {{presentation}} of the city. If the player is successful in rescuing the hostages and recovering all missiles, the remaining <b>forces</b> <b>will</b> rendezvous at a submarine. During the game, the player-character may grapple onto ledges, climb ladders, crawl, and jump in any direction. The player can also push large crates in order to reach higher platforms. Combat is focused on shooting an enemy with a weapon on sight, however the player can crawl at any time {{in order to avoid the}} oncoming bullets of an enemy. The player is also able to neutralise enemies by dropping down onto them whilst dangling from a higher platform. In every level, the game sets a time limit when a bomb is placed on one of the crates containing Stinger missiles.|$|E
5|$|There {{are eight}} {{possible}} endings. The Sole Survivor {{is faced with}} a choice: to destroy Far Harbor, to destroy the Children of Atom, or to inform the people of Far Harbor of DiMA's crime and trigger a feud between the Harbormen and Acadia. Should the player choose to detonate the warhead, the Harbormen will {{take control of the}} island, while if the player destroys the fog condensers, the Children will become dominant. In both scenarios Acadia will be spared, though DiMA will be disapprove of the player's actions. Alternatively, if the player confronts DiMA over Avery's murder, Acadia may become hostile. The Sole Survivor is able to establish a more permanent peace between all parties by assassinating or chasing away High Confessor Tektus, and allowing DiMA to replace him with a synth who will adopt a more moderate stance towards the Harbormen. The Sole Survivor can choose to make the main factions aware of Acadia's existence. If so, The Institute, a scientific organization that made the synths, will send agents to reclaim the synths, while the Brotherhood of Steel, a quasi-religious organization rooted in the United States Armed <b>Forces,</b> <b>will</b> launch an expedition to exterminate them. The Railroad, a group opposed to the existence of The Institute with the aim of freeing sentient synths, will send an operative to make contact with Acadia, though the latter will reject their help.|$|E

25|$|The rails need to {{withstand}} enormous repulsive forces during shooting, and these <b>forces</b> <b>will</b> tend {{to push them}} apart {{and away from the}} projectile.
