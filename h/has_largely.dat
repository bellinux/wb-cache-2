5|$|Calan Gaeaf, {{associated}} with the supernatural and the dead, is observed on 1 November (All Saints Day). It <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> been replaced by Hallowe'en. Other festivities include Calan Mai (May Day), celebrating the beginning of summer; Calan Awst (Lammas Day); and Gŵyl Fair y Canhwyllau (Candlemas Day).|$|E
5|$|In {{its early}} days, the city's {{economic}} base comprised the lumber, railroad, and ranching industries. Today, that <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> {{been replaced by}} tourism, education, government, and transportation. Some of the larger employers in Flagstaff are Northern Arizona University, the Flagstaff Medical Center, and the Flagstaff Unified School District. Tourism is a large contributor to the economy, as the city receives over 5 million visitors per year.|$|E

5|$|In organic chemistry, lead(II) nitrate {{has been}} used as an oxidant, for example as an {{alternative}} to the Sommelet reaction for oxidation of benzylic halides to aldehydes. It has also found use in the preparation of isothiocyanates from dithiocarbamates. Because of its toxicity it <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> fallen out of favour, but it still finds occasional use, for example as a bromide scavenger during SN1 substitution.|$|E
5|$|The Palladian {{house has}} a Greek Revival {{interior}} which <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> survived the various uses of the building. The grounds were originally landscaped by Humphrey Repton, part of which is now within the Leigh Woods National Nature Reserve. An organic farm has also been established based on the walled garden.|$|E
5|$|Two related {{processes}} for the carbonylation of methanol: the rhodium-catalyzed Monsanto process, and the iridium-catalyzed Cativa process. The latter process is greener {{and more efficient}} and <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> supplanted the former process, often in the same production plants. Catalytic amounts of water are used in both processes, but the Cativa process requires less, so the water-gas shift reaction is suppressed, and fewer by-products are formed.|$|E

5|$|Because Corman did {{not believe}} that The Little Shop of Horrors had much {{financial}} prospect after its initial theatrical run, he did not bother to copyright it, resulting in the film falling into the public domain. Because of this, the film is widely available in copies of varying quality. The film was originally screened theatrically in the widescreen aspect ratio of 1.85:1, but <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> only been seen in open matte at an aspect ratio of 1.33:1 since its original theatrical release.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{hazardous}} nature of lead(II) nitrate, {{there is a}} preference for using alternatives in industrial applications. In the formerly major application of lead paints, it <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> been replaced by titanium dioxide. Other historical applications of lead(II) nitrate, such as in matches and fireworks, have declined or ceased as well. Current applications of lead(II) nitrate include use as a heat stabiliser in nylon and polyesters, as a coating for photothermographic paper, and in rodenticides.|$|E
5|$|Biology <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> {{rejected}} the idea that evolution is guided in any way, but the evolution of some features is indeed facilitated by the genes of the developmental-genetic toolkit studied in evolutionary developmental biology. An example {{is the development of}} wing pattern in some species of Heliconius butterfly, which have independently evolved similar patterns. These butterflies are Müllerian mimics of each other, so natural selection is the driving force, but their wing patterns, which arose in separate evolutionary events, are controlled by the same genes.|$|E

5|$|Chloralkali process: The largest {{industrial}} use of mercury during the 20th century was in electrolysis for separating chlorine and sodium from brine; mercury being the anode of the Castner-Kellner process. The chlorine {{was used for}} bleaching paper (hence the location {{of many of these}} plants near paper mills) while the sodium was used to make sodium hydroxide for soaps and other cleaning products. This usage <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> been discontinued, replaced with other technologies that utilize membrane cells.|$|E
5|$|Due to Oklahoma's {{location}} at {{the confluence of}} many geographic regions, the state's climatic regions have {{a high rate of}} biodiversity. Forests cover 24 percent of Oklahoma and prairie grasslands composed of shortgrass, mixed-grass, and tallgrass prairie, harbor expansive ecosystems in the state's central and western portions, although cropland <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> replaced native grasses. Where rainfall is sparse in the state's western regions, shortgrass prairie and shrublands are the most prominent ecosystems, though pinyon pines, red cedar (junipers), and ponderosa pines grow near rivers and creek beds in the panhandle's far western reaches. Southwestern Oklahoma contains many rare, disjunct species including sugar maple, bigtooth maple, nolina and Southern live oak.|$|E

5|$|During the 20th {{century and}} {{following}} the wide-scale adoption of the scientific method, astrology has been challenged successfully on both theoretical and experimental grounds, and {{has been shown to}} have no scientific validity or explanatory power. Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing, and common belief in it <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> declined. While polling studies have demonstrated that approximately 25% of Americans, Canadians, and Britons say they continue to believe that star and planet positions affect their lives, astrology is now recognized as pseudoscience.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) <b>has</b> <b>largely</b> removed {{himself to}} the online virtual world of Second Life. Dwight has created an avatar named Dwight Shelford, also a paper salesman, {{patterned}} after his once-perfect real life. He now uses Second Life as an escape from his real-life troubles, even going as far as creating a virtual Second Life, called Second Second Life. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), on the other hand, has created an avatar named Jim Samtanko, a guitar-playing Philadelphia sportswriter, and enters Second Life in order to spy on Dwight.|$|E
5|$|Following Marsh, Ceratopsia has {{usually been}} {{classified}} as a suborder within the order Ornithischia.
