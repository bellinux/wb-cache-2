5|$|Alfonsín {{began his}} term with many {{economic}} problems. The foreign debt was nearly 43billion dollars {{by the end}} of the year, and the country had narrowly prevented a sovereign default in 1982. During that year, the gross domestic product fell by 5.6%, and the manufacturing profits by 55%. Unemployment was at nearly 10%, and inflation was nearly 209%. It also appeared unlikely that the country would receive the needed foreign investment. The country had a deficit of $6.7billion. Possible solutions such as a <b>devaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> currency, privatization of industry, or restrictions on imports, would probably have proven to be unpopular.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{abandoned}} {{the gold standard}} in December 1929, earlier than most countries. For much of the previous period, the country had operated a currency board, in which a body known as the caja de conversión was charged with maintaining the peso's value in gold. The <b>devaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peso increased the competitiveness of its exports and protected domestic production. Argentina saw {{the value of its}} exports drop from $1,537 million in 1929 to $561 million in 1932, but this was by no means the most severe downturn in the region.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{fell into}} a deep {{recession}} {{in the second half of}} 1998, triggered and then compounded by a series of adverse external shocks, which included low prices for agricultural commodities, the appreciation of the US dollar, to which the peso was pegged at par, the 1998 Russian financial crisis, the LTCM crisis and the <b>devaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brazilian real in January 1999. Argentina did not enjoy a rapid recovery, and the sluggishness of GDP growth fuelled concerns about the sustainability of public debt.|$|E

5|$|Domitian's {{tendency}} towards micromanagement {{was nowhere}} {{more evident than}} in his financial policy. The question of whether Domitian left the Roman Empire in debt or with a surplus {{at the time of his}} death has been fiercely debated. The evidence points to a balanced economy for the greater part of Domitian's reign. Upon his accession he revalued the Roman currency dramatically. He increased the silver purity of the denarius from 90% to 98% — the actual silver weight increasing from 2.87grams to 3.26grams. A financial crisis in 85 forced a <b>devaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> silver purity and weight to 93.5% and 3.04grams respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1832, {{the state}} began {{construction}} on the Wabash and Erie Canal. The canal was started at Lake Erie, passed through Fort Wayne, and connected to the Wabash River. This new canal made water transport possible from New Orleans to Lake Erie on an internal route rather than sailing around {{the whole of the}} Eastern United States and entering through Canada. Other canal projects were started, but all were abandoned before completion due to the state's foundering credit after the <b>devaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bonds.|$|E
5|$|In 215 Caracalla {{introduced}} the antoninianus, a coin intended {{to serve as}} a double denarius. This new currency, however, had a silver purity of about 52% for the period between 215 and 217 and an actual size ratio of 1antoninianus to 1.5denarii. This in effect made the antoninianus equal to about 1.5denarii. The reduced silver purity of the coins caused people to hoard the old coins that had higher silver content, making the inflation problem caused by the earlier <b>devaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> denarii worse than it had been before.|$|E
25|$|Inflation {{accelerated}} as {{a result}} of a combination <b>of</b> factors: <b>the</b> exchange-rate <b>devaluations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> austerity program, a growing public deficit, and an increasing indexation of financial balances, wages, and other values for inflation. The first two factors are classical causes <b>of</b> inflation; <b>the</b> last became an important mechanism for propagating hyperinflation and in preventing <b>the</b> usual instruments <b>of</b> inflation control from operating.|$|R

50|$|Again in {{recession}} by 1978, the economy {{continued to be}} saddled with inflation around 175%. Image-conscious and so, fearful of possible riots, Martínez de Hoz relented and in December, he issued new, more generous wage guidelines. To address his fellow conservatives' fear that this might lead to even higher inflation, he introduced a novel take on the currency crawling peg: fixed, progressively smaller <b>devaluations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> official exchange rate between the Argentine peso and the US dollar set by a monthly timetable, popularly known as the Tablita.|$|R
5|$|After the {{original}} {{contract with the}} state was terminated, a new agreement {{for the production of}} 650 vehicles to be delivered between 1948 and 1952 was reached. The state helped production with a significant prepayment of 132 million marks. According to the contract, 150 vehicles were scheduled to be built in 1948. The company reached this target and made a further 11 vehicles for private use. 92 were sold under the name of Sisu S-22 or S-22K and 69 were badged as Vanaja V-48. 101 M2 Half-Tracks were sold. In 1948, VAT made a loss of 746,000 marks. In 1949, VAT made another 150 vehicles for the state and 37 vehicles for private operators; it produced 163 V-48s and 24 VaWhs. The company also sold 211 M2 Half-Tracks, allowing it to declare its first profit of 1.208 million marks, which was helped by a <b>devaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Finnish mark.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the economy}} was already in a mild {{recession}} at this point, conditions worsened substantially after the <b>devaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mexican peso during December 1994. The economy shrank by 4%, and a dozen banks collapsed. With the labour force continuing to expand and employment falling sharply along with aggregate demand, unemployment rose by over 6% in 6 months. But the government responded effectively: it tightened bank regulation and capital requirements, and encouraged foreign banks to take over weaker local ones. The economy soon recovered and, between 1996 and 1998, both output and employment grew rapidly and unemployment declined substantially. However, {{at the beginning of}} 1999, the Brazilian currency underwent a strong depreciation. The Argentine economy contracted 4% in 1999, and unemployment increased again.|$|E
5|$|Another crisis {{broke in}} September 1949 when the Air Force picked up {{signs of the}} Soviet Union's RDS-1 nuclear test. Bacher joined Oppenheimer, Parsons, General Hoyt Vandenberg, the Atomic Energy Commissioners and a British {{delegation}} under William Penney to discuss what to do. The recent <b>devaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British pound had already triggered a financial crisis, and there was concern about how the markets would react to the news. Oppenheimer and Bacher saw the evidence of a nuclear test as conclusive, and Bacher in particular came down strongly {{on the side of}} making a public announcement, as {{the number of people who}} already knew made a leak almost inevitable. Truman made the announcement a few days later.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{monetary}} reform {{carried out by}} King Stanisław II Augustus which aimed to simplify the system, the złoty became Poland's official currency and <b>the</b> exchange rate <b>of</b> 1 złoty to 30 groszy was confirmed. The king established the system {{which was based on}} the Cologne mark (233.855 g of pure silver). Each mark was divided into 10 Conventionsthaler <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Roman Empire, and 1 thaler was worth 8 złotych (consequently, 1 złoty was worth 4 grosze. The system was in place until 1787. Two <b>devaluations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> currency occurred in the years before <b>the</b> final partition <b>of</b> Poland.|$|R
50|$|A {{collapse}} in asset prices {{also contributes to}} a sharp slowdown in economic activity. <b>The</b> value <b>of</b> loan collaterals are severely reduced which further impacts <b>the</b> situation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> financial system and reduces credit, reflecting in lower consumption and investment. Furthermore, lower asset prices have negative wealth effects for consumers, which further reduce consumption spending. <b>The</b> features <b>of</b> sudden stops {{are similar to those}} of balance of payment crises in terms <b>of</b> <b>devaluations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> domestic currency followed by periods of output loss. However, sudden stops are characterized by sharper recessions and a larger fall in <b>the</b> price <b>of</b> non-tradable to tradable goods.|$|R
50|$|However {{businesses}} did {{not accept}} that the EEA members would be equal members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> single market and investment flows {{did not return to}} normal. The large manufacturers in Sweden were instrumental in pushing government policy further towards membership rather than remaining with the EEA, which the export focused industries found insufficient. The economic pressures overcame long standing opposition from the social democrat governments which saw the EU as too neo-liberal and a danger to Nordic capitalism. Firms were only kept within Sweden by <b>devaluations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Swedish krona, a strategy which was unsustainable in the long term.|$|R
5|$|Because of the {{long-term}} effects of inflation, notably the significant increase of movie theater ticket prices, the list unadjusted for inflation gives far more weight to later films. The unadjusted list, while commonly found in the press, is therefore largely meaningless for comparing films widely separated in time, as many films from earlier eras will never appear on a modern unadjusted list, despite achieving higher commercial success when adjusted for price increases. To compensate for the <b>devaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> currency, some charts make adjustments for inflation, but not even this practice fully addresses the issue since ticket prices and inflation do not necessarily parallel one another. For example, in 1970, tickets cost $1.55 or about $6.68 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars; by 1980, prices had risen to about $2.69, a drop to $5.50 in inflation-adjusted 2004 dollars. Ticket prices have also risen at different rates of inflation around the world, further complicating the process of adjusting worldwide grosses.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1966 Defence White Paper, the Air Ministry {{decided on}} two aircraft: the F-111K, with a longer-term {{replacement}} being a joint Anglo-French project for a variable geometry strike aircraft - the Anglo French Variable Geometry Aircraft (AFVG). A censure debate followed on 1 May 1967, in which Healey claimed {{the cost of}} the TSR-2 would have been £1,700 million over 15 years including running costs, compared with £1,000 million for the F-111K/AFVG combination. Although 10 F-111Ks were ordered in April 1966 with an additional order for 40 in April 1967, the F-111 programme suffered enormous cost escalation coupled with the <b>devaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pound, far exceeding that of the TSR-2 projection. Many technical problems were still unresolved before successful operational deployment and, faced with poorer-than-projected performance estimates, the order for 50 F-111Ks for the RAF was eventually cancelled in January 1968.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} arrival of the Belgian {{government}} in exile in London, negotiations began between the Belgians and the British about the role which the Congo would play in the Allied war effort. The British were determined that the Congo should not fall into Axis hands, and planned to invade and occupy the colony if the Belgians did not come to an arrangement. This was particularly because, after the fall of Dutch and British colonies in the Far East to Japan, the Allies were desperate for raw materials like rubber which the Congo could produce in abundance. Eventually, the two parties came to an arrangement in which all the British demands were accepted, including a 30 percent <b>devaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Congolese franc.|$|E

5|$|The RPF {{went back}} on the {{offensive}} on 8 February, fighting south from the territory it already held in Rwanda's northern border regions. In contrast to the October 1990 and the 1991–1992 campaigns, the RPF advance in 1993 was met with only weak resistance from the FAR forces. The likely {{reason for this is}} a significant deterioration in morale and military experience in the government forces. The impact of the long running war on the economy, and a heavy <b>devaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rwandan franc compared to the United States dollar, had left the government unable to pay its soldiers in a timely manner. The armed forces had also expanded rapidly, at one point growing from less than 10,000 troops to almost 30,000 in one year. The new recruits were often poorly disciplined and not battle ready, with a tendency to get drunk and carry out abuse and rapes of civilians.|$|E
5|$|The {{agricultural}} trade boom in Eastern Europe {{showed the}} first signs of the approaching crisis in the 1580s, when food prices stopped increasing. It was followed by a gradual decline in agricultural products prices, a price depression, initially present in Western Europe. The negative consequences of this process on folwark economies of the East had reached its culmination {{in the second half of}} the 17th century. Further economic aggravation resulted from Europe-wide <b>devaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> currency around 1620, caused by the influx of silver from the Western Hemisphere. At that time however massive amounts of Polish grain were still exported through Danzig (Gdańsk). The Commonwealth nobility took a variety of steps to combat the crisis and keep up high production levels, burdening in particular the serfs with further heavy obligations. The nobles were also forcibly buying or taking over properties of the more affluent thus far peasant categories, a phenomenon especially pronounced from the mid 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Mid-March brought warmer air to {{the country}} which thawed the snow lying on the ground. This {{snowmelt}} rapidly ran off the frozen ground into rivers and caused widespread flooding. More than 100,000 properties were affected, and the British Army and foreign aid agencies were required to provide humanitarian aid. With the cold spell over and the ground thawing, there were no further weather problems. The winter had severe effects on British industries, causing the loss of around 10per cent of the year's industrial production, 10to 20per cent of cereal and potato crops, and a quarter of sheep stocks. The ruling Labour Party began to lose its popularity, which led to them losing many seats to the Conservative Party in the 1950 election. That winter is also cited {{as a factor in}} the <b>devaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pound from $4.03 to $2.80, Britain's decline from being a superpower, and the introduction of the Marshall Plan to aid war-torn Europe. The effects on the rest of Europe were also severe, with 150 deaths from cold and famine in Berlin, civil disorder in the Netherlands and business closures in the Republic of Ireland.|$|E

25|$|The 1964 coup {{dealt with}} the {{political}} obstacles by forcefully restraining opposition to <b>the</b> military agenda <b>of</b> change. With <b>the</b> objective <b>of</b> transforming Brazil into a modern capitalist economy and a military power, the regime implemented a series of reforms aimed at reducing inflation, at removing some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distortions <b>of</b> import substitution industrialization, and at modernizing capital markets. The regime gradually introduced incentives to direct investment, domestic and foreign, and tackled balance of payments problems by reforming and simplifying the foreign-exchange system.

5|$|While the Suez Crisis caused British {{power in}} the Middle East to weaken, it did not collapse. Britain again {{deployed}} its armed forces to the region, intervening in Oman (1957), Jordan (1958) and Kuwait (1961), though on these occasions with American approval, as the new Prime Minister Harold Macmillan's foreign policy was to remain firmly aligned with the United States. Britain maintained a {{military presence in the}} Middle East for another decade. On 16 January 1968, {{a few weeks after the}} <b>devaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pound, Prime Minister Harold Wilson and his Defence Secretary Denis Healey announced that British troops would be withdrawn from major military bases East of Suez, which included the ones in the Middle East, and primarily from Malaysia and Singapore by the end of 1971, instead of 1975 as earlier planned. By that time over 50,000 British military personnel were still stationed in the Far East, including 30,000 in Singapore. The British withdrew from Aden in 1967, Bahrain in 1971, and the Maldives in 1976.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the era, with difficult terrain, poor roads and methods of transport there was little trade between different areas of the country and most settlements depended on what was produced locally, often with very little in reserve in bad years. Most farming was based on the lowland fermtoun or highland baile, settlements of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams, allocated in run rigs to tenant farmers. They usually ran downhill so that they included both wet and dry land, helping to offset the problems of extreme weather conditions. Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron coulter, pulled by oxen, which were more effective and cheaper to feed than horses. From the mid-sixteenth century, Scotland experienced a decline in demand for exports of cloth and wool to the continent. Scots responded by selling larger quantities of traditional goods, increasing the output of salt, herring and coal. The late sixteenth century was an era of economic distress, probably exacerbated by increasing taxation and the <b>devaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> currency. In 1582 a pound of silver produced 640 shillings, but in 1601 it was 960 and the exchange rate with England was £6 Scots to £1 sterling in 1565, but by 1601 it had fallen to £12. Wages rose rapidly, by between four or five times between 1560 {{and the end of the}} century, but failed to keep pace with inflation. This situation was punctuated by frequent harvest failures, with almost half the years in the second half of the sixteenth century seeing local or national scarcity, necessitating the shipping of large quantities of grain from the Baltic. Distress was exacerbated by outbreaks of plague, with major epidemics in the periods 1584–88 and 1597–1609. There were {{the beginning}}s of industrial manufacture in this period, often using expertise from the continent, which included a failed attempt to use Flemings to teach new techniques in the developing cloth industry in the north-east, but more successful in bringing a Venetian to help develop a native glass blowing industry. George Bruce used German techniques to solve the drainage problems of his coal mine at Culross. In 1596 the Society of Brewers was established in Edinburgh and the importing of English hops allowed the brewing of Scottish beer.|$|E
