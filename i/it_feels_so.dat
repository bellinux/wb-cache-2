500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Do Ya Thang" [...] is a {{complimentary}} love song that contains [...] "curse" [...] words and a repetitive chorus. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy {{wrote that the}} song has a simple message evident in the lyrics, [...] "At {{the end of the}} day you are who you are and I love you that way." [...] Maz Halima of Flavour Magazine described the track as a [...] "serene song". [...] "Do Ya Thang" [...] contains the line [...] "And you my lover / But I love you like a brother" [...] which, according to Popdust's Exton, is reminiscent of actress Angelina Jolie and her brother James Haven at the Oscars. Exton further explained that the song is full with vague descriptions of Rihanna's feelings, which result as [...] "hollow" [...] declaration that she is never going away. While singing the lines [...] "Middle of the Day / Give Me What I want / <b>It</b> <b>feels</b> <b>so</b> special / <b>It</b> <b>feels</b> <b>so</b> good" [...] she admits [...] "liking afternoon delights".|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall, {{television}} {{columnist for}} The Star-Ledger, said the meetings themselves were very entertaining and allowed for good character development between April and Andy, and Ron and April. However, {{he said the}} main plot with Leslie and the historic mansion was not tied strongly enough to Leslie's fear that Mark and Ann would get married. Matt Fowler of IGN praised the episode, especially the callbacks to previous episodes and {{the interaction of the}} characters during the meetings. Although the show was only on hiatus for about a month, he said, [...] "Man, <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>so</b> good to have Parks and Recreation back. [...] I don't think there's another comedy on TV right now that contains such 'miss-able' characters." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. Several reviews wrote positively of {{the ensemble}} and character acting. Hannah Lawrence from Hollywood was happy with romance of the episode, writing [...] "It seems clear that the writers are spending more time on characters finding love, and I actually enjoy it very much ... I suspect the writers are aware that ultimately what all of us want for the Dunder-Mifflin employees is love." [...] CliqueClack wrote positively of the episode, praising the ensemble acting, and wrote, [...] "Overall, another solid ensemble episode. Way to go, The Office!" [...] Many other reviews compared the episode, either positively or negatively, to previous episodes. Jeffrey Hyatt from Screencrave gave the episode an 8/10 rating and wrote, [...] "I'd {{say it was the}} strongest of the six episodes so far this season ... 'Doomsday' delivered that classic, Office formula where everything just works – and <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>so</b> right." [...] Joseph Kratzer from WhatCulture awarded the episode 3-and-a-half stars out of five and compared it to the season's previous episodes, writing, [...] "For a minute there I thought season eight of The Office was going {{to be some kind of}} subpar shut-out, but thankfully 'Doomsday' has lifted the series out of the rut it's been in ... I feel 'Doomsday' was successful because it captured a sense of ease and fluidity the show's been lacking severely since Michael's departure." ...|$|E

5000|$|Metric {{received}} their first major public exposure in August 2001 with the television commercial [...] "Be Afraid", advertising Polaroid's I-Zone Pocket Fortune film. The music {{used for the}} ad {{was taken from the}} song [...] "Grow Up and Blow Away", with the line [...] "Why does <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> <b>so</b> good to die today?" [...] changed to [...] "Why does <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> <b>so</b> good to fly today?".|$|R

500|$|William Wong of Computer Shopper {{called it}} [...] "a great game that {{is backed by}} good {{graphics}} and sound, and will keep you going for hours"; he also praised its cutscenes. He concluded, [...] "If the [...] multiplayer pack {{is as good as}} the standalone version, Terra Nova could be a strike force to be reckoned with." [...] PC Gamer UKs James Flynn praised the game's graphics, sense of realism, and free-form missions; about the latter, he wrote, [...] "There's no right or wrong way to complete any of the missions in Terra Nova, {{and this is one of}} its strongest assets." [...] He noted that it was [...] "virtually impossible to recommend" [...] the game to those with lower-end computers, but he believed that it was also [...] "impossible to condemn Looking Glass for programming the game this way, because <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>so</b> real, and its authenticity is what makes it so much fun". Daniel Jevons of Maximum approved of the graphics but disliked the focus on long-range combat and the use of the mouse to move a crosshair rather than the entire viewpoint. However, he concluded that the game [...] "has a degree of depth that most robot combat games lack, the plot is strangely involving and despite the initial control difficulties, with perseverance most competent gamers will soon be stomping around the battlefields". Michael E. Ryan of PC Magazine praised the game's artificial intelligence and called its graphical quality [...] "spectacular", but found its movement controls to be [...] "awkward". He concluded, [...] "Terra Nova is an exceptional game that combines frenetic, fast-paced action with real-time squad-level tactics. It doesn't get much better than this".|$|E
500|$|Like Eno's {{previous}} album Here Come the Warm Jets, Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) {{received a}} mostly very positive reception from critics. Writing for the Village Voice, Robert Christgau gave the album {{a rating of}} A–, writing [...] "Every cut on this clear, consistent, elusive album affords distinct present pleasure. Admittedly, when they're over they're over—you don't flash on them {{the way you do}} on [...] "Cindy Tells Me" [...] and [...] "Baby's on Fire". But that's just his way of being modest." [...] Wayne Robbins of Creem lauded Eno for the way he [...] "grafts seemingly disparate elements in any way that might be useful to his flow". Robbins explained, [...] "It sounds like it might be pretentious; it's not, because Eno is comfortable with those pretensions"; he concluded that [...] "a man who can write songs like 'Burning Airlines Give You So Much More' has seen the future, and the future is a sonic Disney named Eno, who makes music you can live with". Circus magazine described the album as [...] "Sick! Sick! Sick! But, oh-h-h, <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>so</b> good! [...] guaranteed to be put on the 'Most Wanted' list by psychopaths everywhere [...] takes you on a dada-ists tour-de-force, lampooning and integrating every type of music conceivable". Critic Ed Naha, writing in Crawdaddy!, gave the album a negative review, writing [...] "Much of the Wonderlandish magic found on Eno's first LP is lost on this rocky terrain, being replaced by a dull, repetitive aura that is annoying as all hell." [...] In 1975 Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) was voted one of the best albums {{of the year in the}} Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics poll for 1975.|$|E
2500|$|Adams and Vallance jammed on the chord {{progression}} {{for a while}} Adams sang [...] "it cuts like a knife" [...] {{over and}} over again. Vallance eventually responded with [...] "but <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>so</b> right." [...] As Vallance described it, [...] "There's a long tradition in pop music of songs that employ [...] "na-na-na" [...] choruses: [...] "Hey Jude" [...] by The Beatles, [...] "Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye" [...] by Steam, [...] "Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin'" [...] by Journey, and more recently [...] "Drops of Jupiter (Tell Me)" [...] by Train. Adams and I tapped into that tradition for the out-choruses of 'Cuts Like A Knife'." ...|$|E
5000|$|Following the film's Irish première, NextProjection {{called the}} film a [...] "juicy jaunt of a tale," [...] {{and said that}} [...] "like a Raymond Chandler 'cannibalisation', Candlestick may feed off the familiar, but it's the sport with which it spits it back out that makes <b>it</b> <b>feel</b> <b>so</b> fresh".|$|R

60|$|There is one {{day when}} all things are tired, and the very smells, as they drift on the heavy air, are old and used. One cannot explain this, but <b>it</b> <b>feels</b> <b>so.</b> Then there is another day--to the eye nothing {{whatever}} has changed--when all the smells are new and delightful, and the whiskers of the Jungle People quiver to their roots, and the winter hair comes away from their sides in long, draggled locks. Then, perhaps, a little rain falls, and all {{the trees and the}} bushes and the bamboos and the mosses and the juicy-leaved plants wake with a noise of growing that you can almost hear, and under this noise runs, day and night, a deep hum. THAT is the noise of the spring--a vibrating boom which is neither bees, nor falling water, nor the wind in tree-tops, but the purring of the warm, happy world.|$|E
