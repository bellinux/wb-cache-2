50|$|When the dithiane {{is derived}} from an {{aldehyde}} such <b>as</b> <b>acetaldehyde</b> the acyl proton can be abstracted by n-butyllithium in THF at low temperatures. The thus generated 2-lithio-1,3-dithiane reacts as a nucleophile in nucleophilic displacement with alkyl halides such as benzyl bromide, with other carbonyl compounds such as cyclohexanone or oxiranes such as phenyl-epoxyethane, shown below. After hydrolysis of the dithiane group the final reaction products are α-alkyl-ketones or α-hydroxy-ketones. A common reagent for dithiane hydrolysis is (bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo)benzene.|$|R

Flavanol-anthocyanin adducts {{are formed}} during wine ageing through {{reactions}} between anthocyanins and tannins present in grape, with yeast metabolites such <b>as</b> <b>acetaldehyde.</b> Acetaldehyde-induced reactions yield ethyl-linked {{species such as}} malvidin glucoside-ethyl-catechin. This compound has a better color stability at pH 5.5 than malvidin-3O-glucoside.

5000|$|Another {{mechanism}} of Z. bailii {{to deal with}} acid challenge is that the yeast uses a plasma membrane H+-adenosine triphosphatase (H+-ATPase) to expel proton from cells, thereby preventing intracellular acidification. In addition, Cole and Keenan (1987) [...] have suggested that Z. bailii resistance includes an ability to tolerate chronic intracellular pH drops. Besides, {{the fact that the}} yeast is able to metabolize preservatives may also contribute to its acid tolerance.Regarding the resistance of Z. bailii to SO2, it has been proposed that the cells reduce the concentration of SO2 by producing extracellular sulphite-binding compounds such <b>as</b> <b>acetaldehyde.</b>|$|R
50|$|CbiG {{proteins}} {{are specific}} for anaerobic cobalamin biosynthesis. CbiG, which shows homology with CobE of the aerobic pathway, {{participates in the}} conversion of cobalt-precorrin 5 into cobalt-precorrin 6. CbiG {{is responsible for the}} opening of the delta-lactone ring and extrusion of the C2-unit. The aerobic pathway uses molecular oxygen to trigger the events at C-20 leading to contraction and expulsion of the C2-unit as acetic acid from a metal-free intermediate, whereas the anaerobic route involves the internal delivery of oxygen from a carboxylic acid terminus to C-20 followed by extrusion of the C2-unit <b>as</b> <b>acetaldehyde,</b> using cobalt complexes as substrates.|$|R
5000|$|In yeast, {{pyruvate}} decarboxylase acts independently during [...] fermentation and releases the 2-carbon fragment <b>as</b> <b>acetaldehyde</b> plus carbon dioxide. Pyruvate decarboxylase creates {{the means of}} CO2 elimination, which the cell dispels. The enzyme is also means to create ethanol, which is used as an antibiotic to eliminate competing organisms. [...] The enzyme is necessary to help the decarboxylation of alpha-keto acids {{because there is a}} build-up of negative charge that occurs on the carbonyl carbon atom in the transition state; therefore, the enzyme provides the suitable environment for TPP and the alpha-keto acid (pyruvate) to meet.|$|R
50|$|The {{starting}} material is prepared from propargyl chloride and an aldehyde or ketone such <b>as</b> <b>acetaldehyde.</b> In {{the first step}} an azido compound is formed in situ in a nucleophilic displacement of chloride by the azide ion. A (3,3)Sigmatropic reaction takes place between the azide and the alkyne to the allenyl azide. This allene rearranges to the triazafulvene in a 6 pi electrocyclization. The exocyclic alkene in this intermediate is very electrophilic because the triazole group has a dipole moment of 5 debye. The reaction sequence concludes with nucleophilic attack of a second azide ion on this alkene with more double bond rearrangements and proton abstraction from a proton source.|$|R

40|$|A Nocardia rhodochrous strain {{capable of}} {{utilizing}} acetylene as its sole source of carbon and energy exhibited slow growth on low concentrations of acetaldehyde. Resting cells incubated with acetylene formed a product identified <b>as</b> <b>acetaldehyde,</b> but attempts to demonstrate acetylene hydrase activity in cell-free extracts were unsuccessful. Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase in N. rhodochrous {{was found to}} be NAD+ linked and nonacylating, converting acetaldehyde to acetate. Specific activities of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, acetothiokinase, and isocitrate lyase were enhanced in cells grown on acetylene and ethanol as compared with cells grown on alternate substrates. These results suggest that acetylene is catabolized via acetaldehyde to acetate and eventually to acetyl coenzyme A. Acetylene oxidation in N. rhodochrous appears to be constitutive and is not inhibited in the presence of either ethylene, nitrous oxide, or methane...|$|R
30|$|An {{advantage}} of PTR-MS {{is that it}} can be run in real time to continuously collect data on the concentrations of specific compounds [Ezra et al. 2004, Lindinger et al. 1998, Tomsheck et al. 2010]. PTR-MS is primarily a quantitative tool and generally requires a detailed knowledge of the components present to be successfully employed. Ion mass (as measured by a quadrupole mass spectrometer) is not a unique indicator of chemical composition. For instance, an ion at m/z 107 can represent either C 8 H 10 H+ (ethylbenzene or xylene isomer) or C 7 H 6 OH+ (benzaldehyde). Beyond the identification of a few small molecules, such <b>as</b> <b>acetaldehyde</b> and methanol, interpretation of the PTR-MS measurements of complex VOC mixtures benefits from the support of another separation technique to provide identification of components.|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 78 strains of non-Saccharomyces yeasts were isolated: 30 strains of Kloeckera apiculata, 20 of Candida stellata, 8 of Candida valida and 20 of Zygosaccharomyces fermentati.

Within each species, the strains were distinguishable in phenotypes through the production of different amounts of by-products. In particular, a great variability was found in C. stellata, where six different phenotypes were identified {{by means of the}} production of acetaldehyde, ethyl acetate, isobutanol and isoamyl alcohol. At different stages of the spontaneous fermentation different phenotypes of the non-Saccharomyces yeasts were represented, characterized by consistent differences in some by-products involved in the wine bouquet, such as acetaldehyd...|$|R

25|$|Ethanol {{combustion}} in {{an internal}} combustion engine yields many of the products of incomplete combustion produced by gasoline and significantly larger amounts of formaldehyde and related species such <b>as</b> <b>acetaldehyde.</b> This leads to a significantly larger photochemical reactivity and more ground level ozone. These data have been assembled into The Clean Fuels Report comparison of fuel emissions and show that ethanol exhaust generates 2.14times as much ozone as gasoline exhaust. When this is added into the custom Localised Pollution Index (LPI) of The Clean Fuels Report, the local pollution of ethanol (pollution that contributes to smog) is rated 1.7, where gasoline is 1.0 and higher numbers signify greater pollution. The California Air Resources Board formalized this issue in 2008 by recognizing control standards for formaldehydes as an emissions control group, much like the conventional NOx and Reactive Organic Gases (ROGs).|$|R
