40|$|AbstractStructural {{components}} {{operating at}} high temperature are often {{susceptible to the}} incubation and growth of cracks by creep. It is conventional to characterise this behaviour by subjecting laboratory specimens to a selection of constant loads and measuring the time taken for a pre-existing crack to extend a finite amount. In practice, structural components are subjected to external loading such that material at stress concentrations experiences boundary conditions that are a mixture of load and displacement control. Often these boundary conditions are associated with elastic follow-up. This paper describes a set of experiments undertaken to quantify the influence of elastic follow-up on creep crack incubation in a high carbon, high chromium, martensitic (P 92) steel at 650 °C. The experiments were performed using parallel bar test rigs designed in a previous research programme (Shirahatti et al [1, 2]). The test rigs used modified compact tension C(T) specimens fitted adjacent to two parallel bars that introduced elastic follow-up as the C(T) specimen deformed. To complement the elastic <b>follow-up</b> <b>experiments,</b> a set of standard uniaxial round bar creep tests and constant load-controlled creep crack incubation tests were conducted. The uniaxial tests enabled observation of the elastic and creep response of the steel. These data were used as input to both analytical and finite element models of the elastic <b>follow-up</b> <b>experiments.</b> The crack incubation times obtained from the elastic <b>follow-up</b> <b>experiments</b> {{were found to be}} significantly longer than those for equivalent conventional constant load conditions. This was assumed to be a result of the load on the specimen relaxing during elastic follow-up. Finite element models of the experiments confirmed the effect of the load relaxation...|$|R

Orientation tuning, a model that originated with their model, is a concept in which receptive fields of neurons in the LGN excite a cortical simple cell and are arranged in rows. This model was important because it was able to describe a critical period for the proper development of normal ocular dominance columns in the lateral geniculate nucleus, and thus able to explain the effects of monocular deprivation during this critical period.

50|$|Eyes are {{essential}} for organisms, especially terrestrial vertebrates, to observe prey and obstacles; this is critical for their survival. The formation of the eyes starts as optic vesicles and lens derived from the neuroectoderm. Bone morphogenic proteins are known to stimulate eye lens formation.During early development of eyes, {{the formation of the}} optic vesicle is essential in Mice and BMP4 expressed strongly in the optic vesicle and weakly in the surrounding mesenchyme and surface ectoderm. This concentration gradient of BMP4 in optic vesicle is critical for lens induction. Researcher, Dr. Furuta and Dr. Hogan found out that if they did a laser mutation on mice embryos and causing a BMP4 homozygous null mutation, this embryo will not develop the lens. They also did an in situ hybridization of the BMP4 gene showing green color and Sox2 gene in red which they thought it was involved in the lens formation as well. After they did these two in situ hybridizations in the mice embryos, they found that both green and red colors are found in the optic vesicle of the mice embryos. This indicated that BMP4 and Sox2 are expressed {{in the right place at}} the right time of the optic vesicle and prove that they have some essential functions for the lens induction. Furthermore, they did a <b>follow-up</b> <b>experiment</b> that by injecting BMP4 into the BMP4 homozygous mutant embryos rescued the lens formation (12). This indicated that BMP4 is definitely required for lens formation. However, researchers also found that some of the mutated mice cannot be rescued. They later found that those mutants lacked of Msx 2 which is activated by BMP4. The mechanism they predicted was that BMP4 will active Msx 2 in the optic vesicle and concentration combination of BMP4 and Msx2 together active Sox2 and the Sox2 is essential for lens differentiation.|$|E
