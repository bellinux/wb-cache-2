50|$|The 4014 made {{a change}} to the way {{graphics}} points were entered by adding an <b>execution</b> <b>character</b> which denoted that a particular coordinate was complete. This allowed, for instance, the X or Y coordinate to be changed without changing the previously stored location for the other. This was useful for drawing boxes or especially a series of lines like an axis, or drawing a point on the screen by sending in the same address as the one last stored or moved to using dark mode. Since the X and Y coordinates used separate characters, the terminal would still notice a sequence of coordinates being sent in the older 4010 format, and draw them as they arrived, providing backward compatibility.|$|E

This can be overridden by appending an explicit length and/or signedness modifier; for example, 12lu has type unsigned long.

40|$|Even if APL is the best-suited {{programming}} language for multi-dimensional data, nowadays computer applications additionally require complex graphical user interfaces, internet and database access.

Blessed and cursed with a vagabond mentality, the first episode finds the gang still trying to fit into a gated community, where the promise of security is balanced against the cultural clash separating the battle-hardened travelers from those sheltered within. Add one familiar face to the mix, and it’s a pretty irresistible feast." [...] Brandon Davis of Comicbook.com praised the episode and felt that Andrew Lincoln gave his best performance to date, as well as its unique storytelling of shots in the past and present, while also singling out the character of Carol Peletier saying: [...] "Though not given a hefty amount of screen time, McBride's Carol Peletier remains a strong foundation for the group with her sly performance as the undercover post-apocalyptic friendly neighbor."

Staunch performances from the well-known cast and tremendous <b>execution</b> of <b>character</b> relationships combine for a satisfying 90-minute premiere of The Walking Dead.

Foreword In general art of movie, movie art is a department {{that is responsible for}} profiling design and making to get movie image, and that includes generally design and <b>execution</b> of scene, <b>characters</b> and stage property, and that takes movie script and director’s design as guideline and is physical basis of composing movie scene. Therefore, development situation of movie art field shows critical important. In recent years, with the fast development and popularity of three-dimension animation, it provides new creation space for movie art, not only being used in post-production of movie, but also being used more widely in pre-stage of movie art design. Application of three-dimension animation technology in movie art design shows this foreground for us: it may do it better if traditional way can do it; it may do it perfectly if traditional way can not do it. Therefore, three-dimension animation technology changes traditional design way of movie art design...|$|R

These maintenance periods are called Continuous Maintenance Availability (CMAV) periods. All CMAV scheduling aboard the two remaining submarine tenders in the United States fleet, the USS Emory S. Land (AS 39) and the USS Frank Cable (AS 40), is currently done manually. The schedulers rely on their experience and sound judgment {{with the goal of}} successfully completing the most maintenance as quickly and efficiently as possible for approximately 200 jobs, 50 maintenance shops {{and a host of other}} considerations. In this thesis, we develop a job-shop scheduling model, the CMAV Scheduler (CMAV-S). This is a large-scale, mixed-integer, linear program that accounts for a variety of scheduling inputs commonly used by planners: job priority, duration, allowed window of <b>execution,</b> prerequisites, mandatory <b>character,</b> workforce used and available (by shop), and special submarine conditions (active or inactive) needed to perform a job. CMAV-S produces near-optimal schedules that achieve maximum value for all scheduled jobs in about one minute. When compared to our own manual scheduling, we observe CMAV-S improves up to 25 % the required CMAV length to schedule all maintenance. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R
