25|$|Edward arrayed {{his army}} in a {{defensive}} posture among the hedges and orchards of the area, {{in front of}} the forest of Nouallie. He deployed his front line of longbowmen behind a particularly prominent thick hedge, through which the road ran at right angles. The Earl of Douglas, commanding the Scottish division in the French army, advised King John that the attack should be delivered on foot, with horses being particularly vulnerable to English arrows. John heeded this advice, leaving its baggage behind and forming up on <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English.|$|E
500|$|Rix {{shuttled}} {{back and}} forth between her two ailing family members until, on 2 September 1914, Elsie died. For three months Rix withheld the news from her mother, fearing it would harm her already fragile condition. Elizabeth survived the news, but as the war continued, Rix's artistic output dwindled almost to nothing. Then in March 1916, Elizabeth died. Rix was just over thirty years old, and all her immediate relatives were now dead. Recalling the experience, she later wrote: [...] "I could scarcely put one <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other and walked like an old thing".|$|E
500|$|Jaci Stephen of the Daily Mail has criticised Amy for {{the amount}} of make-up she wears. When Leyla accused her of thieving, Stephen said it couldn't have been her because she wears too much eye make-up. She jibed [...] "she's lucky she can find one <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other." [...] When Amy is unsure whether or not to abort her baby, Stephen jested her first {{decision}} should be whether to change her mascara - [...] "I’ve seen less fuel-faced coal miners." [...] Stephen opined that it was obvious David was heading for trouble with [...] "gratingly Geordie Amy." [...] She said she had no sympathy for him because he knowingly walked into Amy's [...] "maelstrom of rampant teen hormones." [...] Entertainment website Digital Spy have chosen certain plots featuring Amy in their [...] "Picture of the day" [...] recommendation feature. These include Amy being accused of thieving, blackmailing David and revealing her pregnancy to Cain.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, Perry is {{depicted}} as having suicidal thoughts and {{lying on the floor}} of a bathroom. The song opens with only piano and Perry's vocals, while she sings [...] "Was twenty-seven, surviving my return from Saturn", and as the song carries on, she finds her strength, singing [...] "By the grace of God / I picked myself back up / I put one <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other and I / Looked in the mirror and decided to stay / Wasn't gonna let love take me out that way". Perry commented on the lyrics: [...] " [...] are very exact and autobiographical. That's how I write. But the one thing about those lyrics is you can hear me finding my strength throughout the song. It starts off really low and then I kind of stand up for myself and say, 'No!'." [...] The song also sees Perry rejecting the idea that the relationship ended because of her.|$|E
2500|$|Gibney Beach {{is located}} on North Shore Road (Route 20) about [...] from Mongoose Junction in {{downtown}} Cruz Bay. There are no signs that lead you to Gibney, no parking lot and no facilities. There {{is only a small}} gravel road leading down to the beach, blocked off by a tall white gate to keep cars out. There is a small opening in the gate allowing entrance by <b>foot.</b> <b>In</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gate, {{a small portion of the}} road is open where about four cars will tightly fit. Even though it is open to the public, the beach has a very private feel.|$|E
2500|$|... "Beautiful Tonight" [...] was {{confirmed}} as the follow-up single {{on the third}} week of January through the Daily Star. The release date is yet to be announced. They stated, [...] "You can imagine our next single Beautiful Tonight being played in a club. Yes, it’s that different to what we usually release. John Shanks wrote it and it’s up-tempo and will open a few eyes and ears. People who don’t usually like Westlife might like it and hopefully people who do like us won’t not like it. It’s young, fresh and exciting so we feel brilliant about it coming out. When they first hear it, some people might go: [...] "Whoa, who is that?” and that’s why we wanted it as our first song on the album. It’d be cool to get a couple of good dance remixes off it but we won’t be coming up with a dance routine for it on tour, except for maybe a few clicks and putting one <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other. The song reminds us of the early days when we put out [...] "World of Our Own". The song was performed live on Irish national television show Paul O'Grady Show. After that, the track peaked at the top 40 of Irish Radio Airplay Chart.|$|E

60|$|The {{infantry}} {{were composed}} of men of good but less exalted families. They wore a red tunic without a belt. They carried a great circular buckler {{of more than}} a yard in diameter, formed of the tough hide of the river horse, brought down from the upper Nile, with a central boss of metal with a point projecting nearly a <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shield, enabling it to be used as an offensive weapon in a close fight. They carried short heavy swords {{similar to those of the}} Romans, and went barefooted. Their total strength seldom exceeded two thousand.|$|E

60|$|And he nailed that shingle to a lath, {{and stood}} the lath up {{four or five}} <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wigwam. Jim was satisfied. He {{said it was a}} sight better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and {{trembling}} all over every time there was a sound. The duke told him to make himself free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone. Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he wouldn't wait for him to howl. Why, he didn't only look like he was dead, he looked considerable more than that.|$|E
60|$|The {{dead man}} {{lay on his}} back, {{sprawling}} with outstretched limbs in {{the centre of the}} room. He was clad only in a pink dressing gown, which covered his night clothes. There were carpet slippers on his bare feet. The doctor knelt beside him and held down the hand lamp which had stood on the table. One glance at the victim was enough to show the healer that his presence could be dispensed with. The man had been horribly injured. Lying across his chest was a curious weapon, a shotgun with the barrel sawed off a <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triggers. It was clear that this had been fired at close range and that he had received the whole charge in the face, blowing his head almost to pieces. The triggers had been wired together, so as to make the simultaneous discharge more destructive.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Wat Danbury {{was not the}} lad to flinch, and at it he went full split, {{like a man who}} {{means what}} he is doing. She rose gallantly to it, rapped it hard with her front hoof, shook him on to her withers, {{recovered}} herself, and was over. Wat had hardly got back into his saddle when there was a clatter behind him like the fall of a woodstack, and there was the top bar in splinters, the horse on its belly, and the huntsman on hands and knees half a dozen yards in front of him. Wat pulled up for an instant, for the fall was a smasher; but he saw old Joe spring to his feet and get to his horse's bridle. The horse staggered up, but the moment it put one <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other, Wat saw that it was hopelessly lame--a slipped shoulder and a six weeks' job. There was nothing he could do, and Joe was shouting to him not to lose the hounds, so off he went again, the one solitary survivor of the whole hunt. When a man finds himself there, he can retire from fox-hunting, for he has tasted the highest which it has to offer. I remember once when I was out with the Royal Surrey--but I'll tell you that story afterwards.|$|E

6000|$|... "Victory did {{not escape}} him," [...] said Foret: [...] "he was victorious to the last--victorious till he fell. You know, gentlemen, {{it had been}} {{arranged}} that Nantes should be attacked {{at the same moment}} by Charette from the southern banks of the Loire, and by Cathelineau from the northern, but this {{we were not able to}} accomplish. Charette was at his post, and entered the town gallantly over the Pont Rousseau, but we were unable to be there at the appointed time. For ten hours we were detained by a detachment of the blues at the little town of Nort, and though we carried it at last, without losing many of our men, the loss of the precious hours was very grievous. We pushed on to Nantes, however, without losing another minute, and though we found the rebels ready to receive us, they could not hold their ground against us at all. We drove them from the town in every direction. We were already in the chief square of Nantes, assured of our victory, and leading our men to one last attack, when a musket ball struck Cathelineau on the arm, and passing through the flesh entered his breast. He was on <b>foot,</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brave peasants whom he was leading, and they all saw him fall. Oh, M. de Lescure, if you had heard the groan, the long wail of grief, which his poor followers from St. Florent uttered, when they saw their sainted leader fall before them, your ears would never forget the sound. We raised him up between us, and carried him back to a part of the town which was in our hands, and from thence over the Pont Rousseau to Pirmil, where I left him for a while, and returned to the town, but I could not get the peasants to follow me again--that is, his peasants; and he was too weak to speak to them himself. It was not till two hours after that he was able to speak a word." ...|$|E
