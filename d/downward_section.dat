40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} obtain the loading {{characteristics}} of magnetic particle brake (MPB) in rotary system, the servo-motor controlling and testing experimental platform is used to research MPB loading characteristics. The key step is designing different experiments that include static loading experiment, step loading experiment, and tracking loading experiment. Based on the static experiment data, the MPB static property presents hysteresis which is described appropriately {{in the way of}} piecewise fitting. The response time in step experiment is longer in upward section than in <b>downward</b> <b>section</b> and it has no relation with the speed of MPB by lucubrating step experiment data. Phase difference is relevant to input current excitation frequency after analyzing tracking experiment data. The loading characteristic of MPB is closely relation to the MPB velocity which is proposed in rotary loading system. When the input current doesn’t change, the output torque increases along with the rotary speed increasing. Also, this paper provides reference materials for improving the loading precision, mathematics modeling, and hysteresis compensation...|$|E

40|$|Experimental {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out on upward and downward vertical pipes with 180 ° bends to study gas-liquid two-phase flow behaviours in pipes with serpentine configuration. Wire mesh sensor (WMS) is installed at top and bottom positions of upward and <b>downward</b> <b>sections</b> in order to identify the void fraction distributions. Film thickness probes are employed to obtain circumferential profile of the liquid film thickness at different axial positions along both sections. Further features such as flow patterns are identified by examining the time trace and probability density function (PDF) data. All measurements are conducted for different superficial gas velocities, while superficial liquid velocity is fixed at 1. 0 m/s. The study identified that the centrifugal force present in 180 ° bends caused a flow maldistribution in the adjacent straight sections. It is noted from the time trace and PDF results that the superficial gas velocity has obvious effects on the flow development along different positions of the pipes, where the flow regime varied over whole velocity ranges tested. These results are confirmed by the cross-sectional view and sliced stack images (longitudinal view) of the void fraction distributions. The results also showed that the flow behaviour in upward and downward pipes is affected by bends, although to varying degrees...|$|R
30|$|As {{illustrated}} in Fig.  6, {{the elastic modulus}} of E 100 at a temperature no higher than 600  K shows a <b>downward</b> concave <b>section</b> as the pressure increases from 20 to 60  GPa. Ruestes et al. [18] reported the elastic constants {{as a function of}} pressure up to 60  GPa by using MD simulations, and the results agree well with the calculated C 11 and C 12 in present work. In return, the calculated elastic modulus of E 100 also shows the same trend with our results. But the calculated elastic modulus of E 100 from DFT calculations [33] gradually increases with the increasing pressure, and no <b>downward</b> concave <b>section</b> is found in the curves. What makes this inconsistency happen? In general, the potentials used in MD simulations are obtained by fitting DFT calculations and experimental results. In this sense, DFT calculations have higher accuracy than MD method. The Ravelo-EAM potential [21] is constructed by introducing high-pressure properties into the fitting DFT equation of state (EOS) curve of Ta single crystals. During fitting procedure, the cold curve of EOS is extended to include higher-order (cubic and quartic) terms of lattice constant, which makes MD EOS very sensitive to high-order terms of lattice constant. In other words, this inconsistency may be due to that the Ravelo-EAM potential could not precisely describe the EOS of Ta under the pressure from 20 to 60  GPa. On the whole, it can be concluded that the curves of elastic modulus versus pressure have a similar trend at different temperature, and the elastic modulus gradually increases with the increasing pressure over ~[*] 40  GPa.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how well forecasters can {{predict the future}} time path of (policy-determined) short-term interest rates. Most prior {{work has been done}} using U.

We broadly replicate recent U.

Moreover, when ex post errors are assessed depending on whether interest rates have been in an upward, or <b>downward,</b> <b>section</b> of the cycle, they are shown to have been biased and, apparently, inefficient. We attempt to explain those findings, and examine whether the apparent ex post forecast inefficiencies may still be consistent with ex ante forecast efficiency. We conclude, first, that the best forecast may be a hybrid containing a specific forecast {{for the next six months}} and a "no-change" assumption thereafter, and, second, that the modal forecast for interest rates, and maybe for other variables as well, is skewed, generally underestimating the likely continuation of the current phase of the cycle...|$|E

This study aimed to describe kinematics and muscle activation patterns in relation to torque applied in forward and backward grinding. Ten male America’s Cup sailors (33. 6 ± 5. 7 years, 97. 9 ± 13. 4 kg, 186. 6 ± 7. 4 cm) completed forward and backward grinding on a customised grinding ergometer. In forward grinding peak torque (77 Nm) occurred at 95 ° (0 ° = crank vertically up) on the <b>downward</b> <b>section</b> of the rotation {{at the end of}} shoulder flexion and elbow extension. Backward grinding torque peaked at 35 ° (69 Nm) following the pull action (shoulder extension, elbow flexion) {{across the top of the}} rotation. During forward grinding, relatively high levels of torque (> 50 Nm) were maintained through the majority (72 %) of the cycle, compared to 47 % for backward grinding, with sections of low torque corresponding with low numbers of active muscles. Variation in torque was negatively associated with forward grinding performance (r = − 0. 60; 90 % CI − 0. 88 to − 0. 02), but positively associated with backward performance (r = 0. 48; CI = − 0. 15 to 0. 83).

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{geometric}} effects of 90 -degree vertical elbows and flow configurations in two-phase flow. The {{study shows that}} the elbows make {{a significant effect on}} the transport characteristics of two-phase flow, which includes the changes in interfacial structures, bubble interaction mechanisms and flow regime transition. The effect of the elbows is characterized for global and local two-phase flow parameters. The global two-phase flow parameters include two-phase pressure, interfacial structures and flow regime transition. In order to characterize the frictional pressure drop and minor loss across the vertical elbows, pressure measurements are obtained across the test section over a wide range of flow conditions in both single-phase and two-phase flow conditions. A two-phase pressure drop correlation analogous to Lockhart-Martinelli correlation is proposed to predict the minor loss across the elbows. A high speed camera is employed to perform extensive flow visualization studies across the elbows in vertical upward, horizontal and vertical downward sections and modified flow regime maps are proposed. It is found that modified flow regime maps immediately downstream of the vertical upward elbow deviate significantly from the conventional flow regime map. A qualitative assessment of the counter-current flow limitation characteristics specific to the current experimental facility is performed. A multi-sensor conductivity probe is used to measure local two-phase flow parameters such as: void fraction, bubble velocity, interfacial area concentration and bubble frequency. The local measurements are obtained for six different flow conditions at ten measurement locations along axial direction of the test section. Both the vertical-upward and vertical-downward elbows {{have a significant impact on}} bubble distribution, resulting in, a bimodal distribution along the horizontal radius of the tube cross-section and migration of bubbles towards the inside of the elbow curvatures immediately downstream of the vertical-upward and vertical-downward elbows, respectively. The elbow effect decays further downstream of the elbow and bubbles migrate to more conventional distribution patterns. The axial transport of void fraction and interfacial area concentration shows that the elbows promote bubble disintegration.

40|$|Multiphase flows {{occurring}} in pipelines with a serpentine configuration {{is an important}} phenomenon, which can be encountered in heat exchangers used {{in a variety of}} industrial processes. More specifically, in many industrial units such as a large cracking furnace in a refinery, the tubes are arranged in a serpentine manner and are relatively short. As flow negotiates round the 180 o bend at the ends of the tubes, the generated centrifugal force could cause flow maldistribution creating local dry spots, where no steady liquid film is formed on the adjacent straight sections of the pipe. As a result, events including coking, cracking and overheating of heat transfer surfaces may occur and lead to frequent shutdown of the facilities. Consequently, this could increase operating costs and reduce production revenue. Thus, it is desirable to know the effect that the bends exert on the flow in the straight part of the pipe. Apart from this, knowledge of the bend effects on the flows in the pipeline could also be important for the design of other pipelines for gas/liquid transport, e. g. offshore gas and oil pipelines. Quite a large number of studies have been found in the literature. The majority of them were for two-phase flow with small diameter pipes (i. d. ≤ 50 mm). However, studies with large diameter pipes (i. d. ≥ 100 mm), have increasingly been considered in recent years as problems related to large diameter vertical pipes are being encountered more and more often in industrial situations. This thesis studies the effect of 180 o bends on the characteristics and development of gas-liquid two-phase flows in large diameter downward and upward pipes. The study particularly focuses on the influence of serpentine configuration on flow structure, cross-sectional void distribution and circumferential liquid film profiles and their development along the <b>downward</b> and upward <b>sections.</b> It was found that both the top and bottom bends have considerable impacts on flow behaviour, although to varying degrees. These impacts were highly dependent on the air and water flow rates. For sufficient flow rates, the bends were observed to create flow maldistribution in the adjacent straight section, due to the effects of centrifugal force. The air moved towards the inner zone of the bend and the water towards the outer zone, while a lesser quantity of water was identified on the other surfaces of the pipe. Investigation of the film thickness development in the <b>downward</b> and upward <b>sections</b> showed that, the liquid film behaviour close to the bends was significantly different from those located further away. This {{can be attributed to the}} centrifugal force of the bends. Examination of the power spectral density (PSD) along the <b>downward</b> and upward <b>sections</b> showed that, the shape of PSD located in the adjacent section to the bends, was substantially different from those located further away. Furthermore, several flow regime maps were generated which showed that, in addition to bubbly, intermittent and annular flows, unstable flows existed along the upward section, particularly for low gas and water flow rates. In this study it was found that, the lower bend was periodically blocked by the liquid and then blown through by the accumulated air. The data obtained from this study were compared with different theoretical correlations found in the existing literature. Some discrepancy between the results of the current study and those of previous published materials was noted. Updated correlations were presented which provided well results when they applied for the data obtained from the current study and previous studies...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} pile strip foundations in {{the areas}} with karst risk. The analysis of karst hole formation mechanism shows the lateral soil pressure on the piles caused by the downfallen soil on the hole rims, which transfers around the hole edges during karst hole formation. In this case, the horizontal pressure of the pile reactive force {{in the area of}} the pile connection with the raft is transferred to the raft. Pile failure at the hole boundaries will lead to the increase of the raft bearing distance above the karst hole. The inadequate raft bearing capacity can provoke the emergency situation. The existing Codes on karst protective foundations design do not contain the analysis of pile and raft horizontal pressure under the downfallen soil. The goal of this work is to develop the method of pile strip foundations analysis {{in the areas}} with karst risk in case of karst hole formation. The analysis of stress-strain state of the system “foundation soil — pile foundation” was carried out using numerical modeling in geotechnical program MIDAS GTS. As a result of numerical investigations, the diagrams of lateral soil pressure onto the piles and the raft are plotted. The pile pressure is approximated with the linear or bilinear function in dependence on geometrical dimensions of the karst hole and strength characteristics of soil that generates the horizontal pressure. In the Codes, the analysis of a pile under lateral soil pressure is given for a pile with the free end. In the problem examined, the pile head has the hinged bearing in place of the connection with the raft. In view of the given boundary data, the pile design scheme is plotted. The inner forces and displacements of the pile are determined by integrating the differential equation of a pile bending. The consistent integrations are evaluated out of the boundary conditions. The boundary values of inner forces and displacements are evaluated from the equality conditions of displacements and inner forces in the pile at the level of the hole bottom that are evaluated in turn for the upward and <b>downward</b> pile <b>section.</b> The method of pile analysis is developed in case of lateral soil pressure approximation with the linear function.

40|$|In this dissertation, an {{experimental}} and numerical study of dense coarse solids-liquid flows has been performed. The experimental work mainly involved pressure drop measurements in a vertical flow loop. A {{limited number of}} measurements of solids velocity profiles were also obtained in the upward flow section of the flow loop. The numerical work involved simulations of coarse particles-in-water flows in vertical and horizontal pipes. The vertical flow simulations were performed using the commercial CFD software, ANSYS CFX- 4. 4, while ANSYS CFX- 10 was used to simulate the flows in the horizontal pipes. The simulations were performed to investigate the applicability of current physically-based models to very dense coarse-particle flows. In the experimental study, measurements of pressure drop and local solids velocity profiles were obtained. The experiments were conducted in a 53 mm diameter vertical flow loop using glass beads of 0. 5 mm and 2. 0 mm diameter solids for concentration up to 45 %. The liquid phase was water. The measured pressure drop exhibited the expected dependence on bulk velocity and solids mean concentration. The wall shear stress was determined by subtracting the gravitational contribution from the measured pressure drop. For flow with the 0. 5 mm particles at high bulk velocities, {{the values of the}} wall shear stress were essentially similar for each concentration in the upward flow sections but more variation, indicating the effect of concentration, was noted in the <b>downward</b> flow <b>section.</b> At lower bulk velocities, the wall shear stresses with the 0. 5 mm glass beads-water flow showed a dependence on concentration in both test sections. This was attributed to an increase in the slip velocity. For the large particle (2. 0 mm glass beads), similar observations were made but the effect of concentration was much less in the upward test <b>section.</b> In the <b>downward</b> test <b>section,</b> the wall shear stress for the flow of the 2. 0 mm glass beads increased by almost a constant value for the bulk velocities investigated. The solids velocity profiles showed that the solids velocity gradient is large close to the wall. In addition, the solids velocity profiles indicated that the slip velocity increased at lower velocities due to increase in the bulk concentration in the upward flow section. For the vertical flow simulations, different physical models based on the kinetic theory of granular flows were programmed and implemented in ANSYS CFX- 4. 4. These models, referred to as the kf-ef-ks-es, kf-ef-ks-es-Ts and kf-ef-ks-kfs models, were investigated by focusing on the closure laws for the solids-phase stress. The treatment of the granular temperature Ts depends on whether small- or large-scale fluctuating motion of the particles is considered. The models were implemented via user-Fortran routines. The predicted results were compared with available experimental results. The predicted solids-phase velocity profiles matched the measured data quite well close to the pipe wall but over-predicted it in the core region. The solids concentration, on the other hand, was significantly under-predicted for concentrations higher than 10 %. Variations in the predictions of the phasic turbulent kinetic energy and the eddy viscosity were noted; the effect of solids concentration on them was mixed. A general conclusion drawn from the work is that a more accurate model is required for accurate and consistent prediction of coarse particle flows at high concentrations (less than 10 %). In a related study, attention was given to wall boundary conditions again focusing on the effect of the solids-phase models at the wall. Comparison between numerical predictions, using some of the existing wall boundary condition models for the solids phase in particulate flows, with experimental results indicated that the physical understanding of the influence of the fluid and solids-phase on each other and their effect on frictional head loss is far from complete. The models investigated failed to reproduce the experimental results. At high solids concentration, it was apparent from the present study that the no-slip and free-slip wall boundary conditions are not appropriate for liquid-solid flows. For the horizontal flow case, three-dimensional simulations were performed with a focus on the velocity and concentration distributions. Medium and coarse sand-in-water flows in three pipe diameters were considered to investigate the default solids stress models in ANSYS CFX- 10. Simulations were performed for three cases by considering: 1) no additional solids-phase stress, i. e. no model for Ts; 2) a zero equation, and 3) an algebraic equilibrium model for the granular temperature. The model predictions were compared to experimental results. The effect of particle size, solids-phase concentration, and pipe diameter was explored using the algebraic equilibrium model. All the cases for the models considered exhibited the characteristic features of horizontal coarse particle slurry flows. The zero equation and the algebraic equilibrium model for the granular temperature produced similar results that were not significantly different from the prediction obtained when no solids-phase stress was considered. The comparison with experimental results was mixed. Locally, the measured solids-phase velocity distributions were over-predicted, whereas the solids concentration was reasonably reproduced in the core of all the pipes. The concentration at the bottom and top walls were over-, and under-predicted, respectively. This was attributed to the inappropriate phasic wall boundary condition models available...|$|R

This electrical resistor makes it possible to generate, without mass inlet, a plume with no soot and to reach a thermal steady state in the ``fire room''. The optical stereoscopic particle image velocimetry measurement technique provides the velocity field through the opening for different diameters. This technique, based on the finding of the displacement of a set of particles between two consecutive snapshots of a seeded fluid, makes it possible to obtain all three components of the velocity vector field by non-intrusive measurement. The use of this technique is a novelty for such vent flows and allows accessing information not only on the variation of the flow rate but also on the distribution of the fluids moving upward and downward through the orifice. Despite an unsteady dynamic regime, the analysis of averaged fields shows a geometrical organization of the bidirectional flow through the orifice, with a central area occupied by the hot fluid flowing upward and a peripheral zone where the cold fluid flows <b>downward.</b> The flow <b>section</b> occupancy ratio reverses with the extrema of flow velocities, for L/D approximate to 0. 41...|$|R
