5|$|Third Lanark A.C. {{took over}} the second Hampden Park in 1903 and renamed it Cathkin Park. The club rebuilt the <b>ground</b> <b>from</b> scratch due to a failure to agree a fee for the whole stadium.

5|$|When Mardonius {{learned of}} the Spartan force, he {{completed}} the destruction of Athens, tearing down whatever was left standing. He then retreated towards Thebes, hoping to lure the Greek army into territory that would be suitable for the Persian cavalry. Mardonius created a fortified encampment on the north bank of the Asopus river in Boeotia covering the <b>ground</b> <b>from</b> Erythrae past Hysiae {{and up to the}} lands of Plataea.|$|E
5|$|Cheyenne {{prototype}} #6 (s/n 66-8831) began conducting weapons {{testing at}} Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona, demonstrating {{the ability for}} the gunner and pilot to accurately fire on separate targets on each side on the helicopter. Towards the end of 1970, the Army funded work on TOW missile guidance and night sighting systems. Prototypes #6 and #9 were also tested and evaluated at Yuma Proving <b>Ground</b> <b>from</b> 30 January to 23 December 1971, to determine if stability and control systems were sufficient. Deficiencies were identified in lateral directional stability, uncommanded motion during maneuvering, high vibration, and poor directional control during sidewards flying.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, Anlaby Road {{was damaged}} by enemy bombing, the repair cost {{of which was}} in the region of £1,000. The Cricket Club served notice to quit at the same time, and so in 1943 the tenancy was officially ended. Hull were forced to return to the Boulevard <b>Ground</b> <b>from</b> 1944 until 1945 because of the poor {{condition}} of the planned stadium at Boothferry Road. The new stadium was finally opened under the revised name of Boothferry Park on 31 August 1946.|$|E
5|$|Everton {{moved to}} nearby Anfield Road, a site where proper covered stands were built. Everton {{played at the}} Anfield <b>ground</b> <b>from</b> 1884 until 1892. During this time the club turned {{professional}} and entered teams in the FA Cup. They became founding members of the Football League and won their first championship at the ground in 1890–91. Anfield's capacity grew to over 20,000 and the club hosted an international match between England and Ireland. During their time at Anfield, Everton became the first club to introduce goalnets to professional football.|$|E

Hartsfield's knives were hard <b>ground</b> <b>from</b> differentially heat-treated A2 tool steel and {{are known for their}} distinctive chisel-ground blades. More accurately, they are zero ground; that is, the edge has no secondary bevel, minimizing drag when used for cutting purposes. Emerson had long been impressed by the cutting ability of the chisel-ground edge and had asked Hartsfield's permission to incorporate it into his own folding knives, which Hartsfield granted. When the SEALs asked Hartsfield to make them a folding knife, he informed them that he did not make folding knives and referred them to Emerson.|$|E

5|$|Kuhn {{denied that}} it is ever {{possible}} to isolate the hypothesis being tested from {{the influence of the}} theory in which the observations are grounded, and he argued {{that it is}} not possible to evaluate competing paradigms independently. More than one logically consistent construct can paint a usable likeness of the world, but there is no common <b>ground</b> <b>from</b> which to pit two against each other, theory against theory. Each paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretations. Neither provides a standard by which the other can be judged, so there is no clear way to measure scientific progress across paradigms.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about this species' behavior. The Congo serpent eagle lives in the {{understory}} of its habitat and occasionally perches on lower boughs in tall trees. It lives either alone or in pairs. This species is known to hunt snakes, lizards, especially chameleons, toads, and potentially small mammals. It hunts by dropping to the <b>ground</b> <b>from</b> its perch in the understory, where it may strike its prey repeatedly with its feet; this serpent eagle may also grab prey from the foliage while hunting. Its large eyes enable this species to hunt in low light, though it is diurnal. Studies on the species' eyes have shown that they have about two times the visual resolution of a human's. It may breed from October to December in Gabon and from June to November in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.|$|E

Smith immediately called Maxwell to ask {{whether or not he}} would be retained to manage Thames Valley Royals, and was told that he would be.|$|E
5|$|Most sources {{suggest that}} the Royal Agricultural Ground was often used as a home venue between 1908 and 1910, before the club hosted matches at the Sydney Sports <b>Ground</b> <b>from</b> 1911 onwards. It was here that the team played all of their home games up until 1986, when the ground was {{demolished}} with the Sydney Cricket Ground No. 2 {{to make way for}} Sydney's main rectangular field, the Sydney Football Stadium. In 1987, games were moved away to the Newtown Jets' home ground, Henson Park, temporarily to await the completion of the Sydney Football Stadium. The team capitalised on this move, finishing second in the regular season. It was the only time between 1983 and 1995 that the side reached the finals.|$|E
5|$|Plans had {{originally}} been laid down to groundshare with Shildon, but arrangements were eventually for Darlington to share Bishop Auckland's Heritage Park <b>ground</b> <b>from</b> {{the start of the}} 2012–13 season. In December 2013, it was confirmed that a deal had been reached in principle for the football team to share Darlington RFC's ground at Blackwell Meadows ground, and thus return to the town of Darlington. In March 2016, it was confirmed that Darlington aimed to relocate by the start of the 2016–17 season, with expansion plans in place to increase the capacity to 3,000, as required for promotion to the National League. In the event, they played their first match at Blackwell Meadows on 26 December 2016, a 3–2 National League North win against F.C. Halifax Town in front of 3,000 spectators.|$|E

5|$|The Shaktisamgama-tantra narrates {{the birth}} of Ucchishta-matangini. Once, the god Vishnu and his wife Lakshmi visited Shiva and his second wife Parvati (a reincarnation of Sati) and gave them a banquet of fine foods. While eating, the deities dropped some food on the <b>ground,</b> <b>from</b> which arose a {{beautiful}} maiden who asked their left-overs. The four deities granted her their left-overs as prasad, food made sacred by having been first consumed by the deity. This {{can be interpreted as}} the Ucchishta of the deity, although due to its negative connotation the word Ucchishta is never explicitly used in connection to prasad. Shiva decreed that those who repeat her mantra and worship her will have their material desires satisfied and gain control over foes, declaring her the giver of boons. From that day, the maiden was known as Ucchishta-matangini.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Georgia Tech's offense {{came on the}} <b>ground</b> <b>from</b> running back Tashard Choice and from quarterback scrambles by Ball. Choice ran the ball 21 times, netting 100 yards. Ball was Tech's second-leading rusher, and picked up 46 yards on 15 different rushes. Eight different players carried the ball for Wake Forest, with Kenneth Moore and Willie Idlette picking up the {{majority of}} the yardage. Moore finished the game with 16 carries for 38 yards, while Idlette earned 35 yards on six different attempts. Half of Idlette's yards came on one 19-yard carry, and he also earned 73 receiving yards during the game to lead all Wake receivers.|$|E
5|$|With a solid {{lead and}} time running {{down in the}} game, Georgia Tech began a {{sequence}} of running plays intended to keep the game clock running while gaining <b>ground.</b> <b>From</b> their 25-yard line, the Yellow Jackets gained 38 yards on seven plays, advancing into Clemson territory in the process. Facing fourth down at the Clemson 37-yard line, the Yellow Jackets attempted to gain a first down rather than kick a long field goal. When they were stopped short of the first-down line, Clemson's offense returned to the field. Spiller again drove the Tigers down the field, opening the drive with a 54-yard run on its first play. Three plays later, Ellington capitalized the drive with a one-yard run for a tying touchdown. The following extra point gave Clemson a one-point lead, 34–33, with 6:11 remaining in the game.|$|E
