25|$|To control foreign exchange, the {{government}} {{brought in a}} number of measures. 40% of the foreign exchange requirements of importers were required to be paid to {{the government}} from April 1952, while as from September 1952 the government decided to provide only a limited amount of foreign exchange, made available every four months. These foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>restrictions,</b> designed to provide the government with much needed reserves meant that some companies were operating at as low as 20% of capacity, due to lack of needed imported materials.|$|E

25|$|In {{his second}} term, Prime Minister Sharif built Pakistan's first major {{motorway}} {{which is known}} as M2 Motorway (3MM), often called the Autobahn of South Asia. This semi-government and semi-private mega-project was completed in November 1997 {{at a cost of}} US$989.12million. His critics questioned the layout of the highway, criticizing its excessive length, its being away from the important cities, and the absence of link roads even with important towns. Furthermore, the funds originally allocated to the construction of Indus Highway linking Peshawar with Karachi were shifted to M2 Motorway thus benefiting his native Punjab and Kashmir provinces at the cost of other provinces. When the true nature of Sharif's motives were exposed, the people of other provinces were extremely displeased, leading to discordance and disharmony among provinces. The welfare of other provinces, notable Sindh and Balochistan Province, were not seriously taken by Sharif and his ruling chief ministers and people of these provinces were disenchanted with him. After the completion of this mega project, Sharif's policies were undermined by lack of capital for investments. There was an influx of foreign capital when he loosened foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>restrictions</b> and opened Karachi Stock Exchange to foreign capital, but the government remained short of funds for investments.|$|E
25|$|For example, if Mauritius imports {{more than}} it exports, then {{this means that the}} supply of rupees is likely to exceed the demand in the foreign exchanging market, ceteris paribus. One can thus infer that the Mauritius rupee would be under {{pressure}} to depreciate against other currencies. On the other hand, if Mauritius exports {{more than it}} imports, then the rupee would be likely to appreciate. Second, a country's balance-of-payment data may signal its potential as a business partner {{for the rest of the}} world. If a country is grappling with a major balance-of-payment difficulty, it may not be able to expand imports from the outside world. Instead, the country may be tempted to impose measures to restrict imports and discourage capital outflows in order to improve the balance-of-payment situation. On the other hand, a country experiencing a significant balance-of payment surplus would be more likely to expand imports, offering marketing opportunities for foreign enterprises, and less likely to impose foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>restrictions.</b> Third, balance-of-payments data can be used to evaluate the performance of the country in international economic competition. Suppose a country is experiencing trade deficits year after year. This trade data may then signal that the country's domestic industries lack international competitiveness. To interpret balance-of-payments data properly, it is necessary to understand how the balance of payments account is constructed.|$|E

Although Henry Kissinger tried to stop the details from making their way to the Japanese government, fearing that it would harm the two countries' security relationship, Miki pushed a bill through the Diet that requested information from the Senate.

Each of the three recombinant viruses induced the synthesis of only the expected polyomavirus early protein in infected CV- 1 cells. The rates of synthesis of large, middle, and small T proteins were ca. 1. 5, 4. 0, and 9. 0 times the rate of synthesis of SV 40 large T protein, respectively. The deletion of introns had no detrimental effect on mRNA biogenesis. Indeed, a further polyomavirus-SV 40 recombinant, containing wild-type polyomavirus early region DNA, expressed an aberrant 58, 000 -dalton form of the middle T protein which we believe to result from utilization of a cryptic splice site. Immunofluorescence studied with monkey cells infected by the recombinant viruses allowed us to determine the cellular locations of the polyomavirus early proteins.

In this paper, we explore the determinants of remittances and their associated transaction costs. We find that recorded remittances depend positively on the stock of migrants and negatively on transfer costs and <b>exchange</b> rate <b>restrictions.</b> In turn, transfer costs are lower when financial systems are more developed and exchange rates less volatile. The negative impact of transactions costs on remittances suggests that migrants either refrain from sending money home or else remit through informal channels when costs are high.

Following incubation with the extracts, the DNA's were introduced in JM 109 bacteria (rec A- and lac Z'-) which were grown in presence of a colorimetric indicator of beta-galactosidase activity. Homologous recombination {{gives rise to the}} genotypical modification: lac Z'+ instead of lac Z'- in the bacteriophage DNA. This is revealed by phenotypical expression of the lac Z' gene product in replicating bacteriophage, i. e. the formation of blue instead of white plaques. The frequency of recombination (blue/total plaques) is increased by a factor of 50 - 80 as a function of protein concentration and of incubation time. The maximal frequency observed is 5 X 10 (- 5). There is no increase over the background when extracts are boiled. Electrophoresis and electron microscopy of DNA's incubated with the extracts show the formation of recombination intermediates with single strand <b>exchange.</b> <b>Restriction</b> analysis of recombined DNA confirms that the process corresponds to targeted sequence exchange. These data allow to propose three steps for homologous recombination between two duplex DNA's: i) unpairing of the two duplexes; ii) single-strand exchange and synaptic pairing; iii) resolution of the cross-junctions.
