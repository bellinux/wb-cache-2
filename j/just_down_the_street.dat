[...] The Stork Club first opened in 1929 at 132 West 58th Street, <b>just</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> from Billingsley's apartment at 152 West 58th Street.

The origin of the name of the club is unknown; Billingsley once remarked, [...] "Don't ask me how or why I picked the name, because I just don't remember." [...] New York City's El Morocco had the sophistication and Toots Shor's drew the sporting crowd, but the Stork Club mixed power, money, and glamor.

5000|$|The mansion {{occupied}} by Madame Dupin was located <b>just</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Plâtrière <b>street</b> ... Rousseau walked to her little salon {{and went into}} the waiting room after having announced by the valet. When taking place on the bench, he smoothed his brocade vest and adjusted his sword. Although he was at his service for nearly four years, Jean-Jacques had never felt at ease in the presence of Madame Dupin. Barely older than him, she had nevertheless managed to preserve her beauty. The grace and elegance of her manners were still enhanced by the delicacy of her features. We can found into her circle the most prestigious guests from Voltaire to Buffon, but also the most prominent members of the Parisian aristocracy. Lively and witty, she was praised even in the homes of other salon-holders. Yet it was in the privacy of one-on-one that the young woman disturbed Jean-Jacques. Her face had a very white complexion, her blond hair pulled back and the softness of her voice made her almost unreal. In those moments, we thought he was dying to talk to her in a whisper, for fear of breaking the spell.|$|R

5000|$|Then, comes a {{day where}} by fate all four Victorinos {{are at the}} same place, when Mora and Gallardo are in jail, Manjarres being at the jail knowing Gallardo is now there and Perez, who was driving a woman to the jail (later {{revealed}} as a mother of an inmate who helps smuggle a bomb into a jail) at the same time, the bomb explodes causing {{a hole in the}} jail wall allowing the prisoners to escape. Gallardo escapes being chased by Mora, with Manjarres not far behind, Diana who was waiting outside the jail to visit Mora and to tell her brother he loved Mora sees this and calls for Mora, he turns around to see her and is shot in the back four times and is killed by Victorino Gallardo, and the second of the four Victorino's dies (Victorino Perez) as a result of <b>just</b> being <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> of <b>the</b> jail, having stayed around to see the commotion and is shot by one of Victorino Gallardo's main henchmen [...] "El Carnicero" [...] and later died in the hospital.

5000|$|... "18 Miles Out" [...] was {{directed}} by Ernest Dickerson and co-written by Scott M. Gimple and showrunner Glen Mazzara. The storyline between Rick Grimes and Shane Walsh reaches a climax in [...] "18 Miles Out", {{in which the two}} men get into a heated argument, ultimately engaging in a physical confrontation. Gimple conceived and wrote the scene into the episode's script. In the fight scene, the moves were choreographed. Dickerson collaborated with Lonnie Smith, Jr. who served as the stunt coordinator. Smith cast two stuntmen to demonstrate and act out the scene for Lincoln and Bernthal so they could duplicate the choreography. Jeremy Connors portrayed Rick, while Trent Bry played the role of Shane. In the fight sequence, Shane topples a motorcycle onto Rick's legs, temporarily immobilizing him. The motorcycle weighed an estimated 800 pounds; in order to decrease the weight of the vehicle, Dickerson and his team emptied the gas tank. This was rehearsed at the series' production studios. Scalan Backus, The Walking Deads special effects technician, rigged the vehicle's footpeg to prevent it from sliding and making contact with the actors' legs. Backus also added a rod with a secure stable so it would give further clearance to the actors and increase the motorcycle's height from the ground. The cameramen filmed the shots at an angle, creating the illusion that the vehicle did hit the actors' legs. Writer Robert Kirkman summated on the aftermath of the confrontation:At the end of this week's episode, Rick is of the mind that they're square; they've got everything out in the open, they've each said their piece and they both know where each other stands, they've had their big blowout and they're riding back in that car and Rick thinks he's handled it. He doesn't necessarily think he's got his friend back, but he thinks the matters are settled. From the look of Shane in that car, I don't know that he's necessarily thinking that. For the most part, this conflict may be put on the back burner for the time being. It definitely seems like Shane still has a bone to pick.While returning to Hershel's farm, Shane stares at a walker in an abandoned field. Kirkman stated the walker symbolizes the growing scope of the zombie virus. [...] "We're really just trying to show that that kind of thing is inescapable," [...] he said. [...] "You're <b>just</b> driving <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> you look over and, 'Oh, there you go, there’s a zombie.'
