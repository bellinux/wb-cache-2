5|$|Cram {{designed}} the chapel {{with the assistance}} of Alexander Hoyle, a member of <b>his</b> <b>firm.</b> Albert M. Friend, a faculty member in Princeton's Department of Art and Archaeology, {{played a central role in}} planning the iconography. It was built by Matthews Construction Company, which worked on several projects on Princeton's campus. Among those who contributed to the design of stained glass windows were Charles Connick, Henry Lee Willet (of the studio that would become Willet Hauser), and Philadelphia-based stained glass artist Nicola d'Ascenzo.|$|E
5|$|During the 1780s, Johnson {{achieved}} success: he {{did well}} financially and <b>his</b> <b>firm</b> published more books with other firms. Although Johnson had begun {{his career as a}} relatively cautious publisher of religious and scientific tracts, he was now able to take more risks and he encouraged friends to recommend works to him, creating a network of informal reviewers. Yet Johnson's business was never large; he usually had only one assistant and never took on an apprentice. Only {{in the last years of}} his life did two relatives assist him.|$|E

DiSuvero was a {{native-born}} Italian {{who grew up in}} Tientsin, China, and had been successful with a jade mine in California. DiSuvero's expertise was in marketing: he formed a company called Sapphire Trading to cut and market the Yogos. He had novel marketing ideas but was not knowledgeable about the mining side of the business. Unable to make payments, his venture folded in late 1979.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1948 Pei was {{recruited}} by New York real estate magnate William Zeckendorf to join a staff of architects for <b>his</b> <b>firm</b> of Webb and Knapp to design buildings around the country. Pei found Zeckendorf's personality the opposite of his own; his new boss {{was known for his}} loud speech and gruff demeanor. Nevertheless, they became good friends and Pei found the experience personally enriching. Zeckendorf was well connected politically, and Pei enjoyed learning about the social world of New York's city planners.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Pilcher of the {{architectural}} firm Pilcher and Tachau {{served as an}} art professor at Vassar between 1900 and 1911; <b>his</b> <b>firm</b> {{was responsible for the}} design of the house. Jewett was built {{at the north end of}} the residential quad, northwest of Lathrop House and northeast of Davison House. Later projects saw the erection of Josselyn House (1912) to Jewett's west and the Students' Building (1913) to its east.

5|$|Moving {{into the}} 1960s, Marcus became ever more {{convinced}} that his city {{and his company}} needed {{to take action to}} promote racial equality, both as a moral issue and to reduce the growing civil unrest. In 1968, he announced that Neiman-Marcus's buyers would give preference to companies employing and training significant numbers of minority employees, making <b>his</b> <b>firm</b> one of the first companies in the nation to have such a policy.|$|E
5|$|As the 1990s began, Pei transitioned into a role of {{decreased}} {{involvement with}} <b>his</b> <b>firm.</b> The staff {{had begun to}} shrink, and Pei wanted to dedicate himself to smaller projects allowing for more creativity. Before he made this change, however, he set {{to work on his}} last major project as active partner: The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. Considering his work on such bastions of high culture as the Louvre and US National Gallery, some critics were surprised by his association with what many considered a tribute to low culture. The sponsors of the hall, however, sought Pei for specifically this reason; they wanted the building to have an aura of respectability from the beginning. As in the past, Pei accepted the commission {{in part because of the}} unique challenge it presented.|$|E
5|$|Conceived as {{an unusual}} {{combination}} of a large church surmounted by a hotel, construction of the building brought architectural dispute. Initially designed by Timothy L. Pflueger in the Gothic Revival style, the investors fired <b>his</b> <b>firm</b> and hired Lewis P. Hobart, who changed little of Pflueger's design. In a resulting lawsuit, Pflueger won nearly half the damages he asked for. The building opened in 1930 as the William Taylor Hotel and Temple Methodist Episcopal Church. However, extra construction expenses had put the congregation at greater financial risk, and the church-hotel concept did not prove popular. No profit was made in six years, and the church left, losing their investment. In the late 1930s the building housed the Empire Hotel, known for its Sky Room lounge, then from World War II to the 1970s, 100 McAllister served as U.S. government offices.|$|E

He saw active service in the Second Boer War, enlisting despite being underage, and again in the First World War, when he was injured in France. His legal career began while back in Southern Rhodesia between those two wars. He won a case against Sir Charles Coghlan, at the time Premier of Southern Rhodesia, and Coghlan invited him to become a partner in <b>his</b> <b>firm,</b> which became known as Coghlan, Welsh & Guest. On his return from the First World War, Guest took responsibility for the Salisbury practice.|$|E
5|$|Hay {{enrolled}} at Brown in 1855. Although he enjoyed college life, {{he did not}} find it easy: his Western clothing and accent made him stand out; he was not well prepared academically and was often sick. Hay gained {{a reputation as a}} star student and became a part of Providence's literary circle that included Sarah Helen Whitman and Nora Perry. He wrote poetry and experimented with hashish. Hay received his Master of Arts degree in 1858, and was, like his grandfather before him, Class Poet. He returned to Illinois. Milton Hay had moved his practice to Springfield, and John became a clerk in <b>his</b> <b>firm,</b> where he could study law.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, while America {{geared up}} for front line {{involvement}} in World War II, Pflueger received fewer assignments {{than he had}} been seeing previously. Grover Magnin kept a flow of work with I. Magnin designs, and Pflueger also helped the Army with a depot building in Ogden, Utah. He began to draw up plans for a 12-story cross-shaped medical teaching hospital for the University of California, San Francisco (eventually to be built at 505 Parnassus in 1955 with additional design work performed by his brother Milton Pflueger). <b>His</b> <b>firm</b> accepted a commission to excavate below the Mark Hopkins Hotel {{in order to create a}} bomb-resistant radio transmission center for AM station KSFO and shortwave programs of the Voice of America. This space became the hotel's underground parking garage after the war.|$|E

5|$|In spring 1917, Rau, by {{this time}} an elected trade union {{official}} in <b>his</b> <b>firm,</b> participated {{in the attempt to}} organise a strike against the war. His action led to a reprimand from his employer, and may have hastened his conscription into the army in August 1917. In the army he was trained in the Zuffenhausen-garrisoned Infantry Regiment 126 and deployed to the Western Front as member of a machine gun company. In September 1918 a shell splinter penetrated his lungs. In the following weeks, he was treated in military hospitals in Weimar and in Stuttgart's neighbouring town Ludwigsburg. While in Ludwigsburg, Rau managed to get leave at short notice on 8November 1918 and joined the in those days developing revolution in Stuttgart.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1922, Howard Roark is {{expelled}} from the architecture department of the Stanton Institute of Technology because he will not adhere to the school's preference for historical convention in building design. Roark goes to New York City and gets a job with Henry Cameron. Cameron was once a renowned architect, but now gets few commissions. In the meantime, Roark's popular, but vacuous, school roommate Peter Keating (whom Roark sometimes helped with projects) graduates with high honors. He too moves to New York, {{where he has been}} offered a position with the prestigious architecture firm, Francon & Heyer. Keating ingratiates himself with senior partner Guy Francon and works to remove rivals within <b>his</b> <b>firm.</b> Eventually, he is made a partner. Meanwhile, Roark and Cameron create inspired work, but struggle financially.|$|E
