5|$|Swedish {{zoologist}} Carl Linnaeus {{first described}} the genus Elephas and an <b>elephant</b> from Sri Lanka (then known as Ceylon) under the binomial Elephas maximus in 1758. In 1798, Georges Cuvier classified the Indian <b>elephant</b> under the binomial Elephas indicus. Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck described the Sumatran <b>elephant</b> in 1847 under the binomial Elephas sumatranus. English zoologist Frederick Nutter Chasen classified all three as subspecies of the Asian <b>elephant</b> in 1940. Asian elephants vary geographically in their colour {{and amount of}} depigmentation. The Sri Lankan <b>elephant</b> (Elephas maximus maximus) inhabits Sri Lanka, the Indian <b>elephant</b> (E.m.indicus) is native to mainland Asia (on the Indian subcontinent and Indochina), and the Sumatran <b>elephant</b> (E.m.sumatranus) is found in Sumatra. One disputed subspecies, the Borneo <b>elephant,</b> lives in northern Borneo and is smaller {{than all the other}} subspecies. It has larger ears, a longer tail, and straighter tusks than the typical <b>elephant.</b> Sri Lankan zoologist Paules Edward Pieris Deraniyagala described it in 1950 under the trinomial Elephas maximus borneensis, taking as his type an illustration in National Geographic. It was subsequently subsumed under either E.m.indicus or E.m.sumatranus. Results of a 2003 genetic analysis indicate its ancestors separated from the mainland population about 300,000years ago. A 2008 study found that Borneo elephants are not indigenous to the island but were brought there before 1521 by the Sultan of Sulu from Java, where elephants are now extinct.|$|E

5|$|Elephants {{usually have}} 26 teeth: the incisors, {{known as the}} tusks, 12 {{deciduous}} premolars, and 12 molars. Unlike most mammals, which grow baby teeth and then replace them with a single permanent set of adult teeth, elephants are polyphyodonts that have cycles of tooth rotation throughout their lives. The chewing teeth are replaced six times in a typical elephant's lifetime. Teeth are not replaced by new ones emerging from the jaws vertically as in most mammals. Instead, new teeth grow in {{at the back of}} the mouth and move forward to push out the old ones. The first chewing tooth on each side of the jaw falls out when the <b>elephant</b> is two to three years old. The second set of chewing teeth falls out when the <b>elephant</b> is four to six years old. The third set is lost at 9–15 years of age, and set four lasts until 18–28 years of age. The fifth set of teeth lasts until the <b>elephant</b> is in its early 40s. The sixth (and usually final) set must last the <b>elephant</b> the rest of its life. <b>Elephant</b> teeth have loop-shaped dental ridges, which are thicker and more diamond-shaped in African elephants.|$|E
5|$|In 1871 the zoo {{acquired}} four giraffes; {{the following}} year an <b>elephant,</b> Maharajah, was bought for £680 from Wombwell's Menagerie No.1 in Edinburgh.

It was therefore decided that Maharajah and his trainer, Lorenzo Lawrence, should walk to Manchester, a journey they completed in 10 days with little incident. Lorenzo became the zoo's head <b>elephant</b> keeper, and stayed at Belle Vue for more than 40 years. Maharajah provided <b>elephant</b> rides to the public for ten years, until his death from pneumonia in 1882. His skeleton was preserved and added to the gardens' natural history museum.

40|$|African <b>elephants</b> (Loxodonta africana) are intensively {{managed in}} {{southern}} Africa and are routinely translocated between reserves. Domesticated <b>elephants</b> {{are used for}} elephant-back safaris and interactions with guests. Understanding how <b>elephants</b> respond to such activities is critical because of welfare issues associated with both humans and <b>elephants.</b> We investigated the stress response (i. e., fecal glucocorticoid metabolite secretion [FGM]) of working <b>elephants</b> in Letsatsing Game Reserve, South Africa, over 1 year to evaluate their response to transportation and ecotourism activities. We used free-ranging <b>elephants</b> in adjacent Pilanesburg National Park as controls. Fecal glucocorticoid metabolites were greatest prior to and during translocation and declined over the year. Within 1 – 2 months of transportation, FGM levels in working <b>elephants</b> became indistinguishable from those in wild <b>elephants.</b> Fecal glucocorticoid metabolite levels were higher during human interaction days than days without interaction. The highest observed FGM levels were associated with transportation and episodic loud noises. Transportation is a stressful activity for <b>elephants,</b> and ≥ 3 months should be provided to translocated <b>elephants</b> to acclimate to their new surroundings.

5|$|African {{elephants}} receive {{at least}} some legal protection in every country where they are found, but 70% of their range exists outside protected areas.

In 1989, the African <b>elephant</b> was listed under Appendix I by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), making trade illegal. Appendix II status (which allows restricted trade) was given to elephants in Botswana, Namibia, and Zimbabwe in 1997 and South Africa in 2000. In some countries, sport hunting of the animals is legal; Botswana, Cameroon, Gabon, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe have CITES export quotas for <b>elephant</b> trophies.
