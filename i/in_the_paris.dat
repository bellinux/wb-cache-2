5|$|After {{travelling}} to Tangiers in 1912, Rix held several successful {{exhibitions of}} her work, with one drawing, Grande marche, Tanger, {{purchased by the}} French government.

The family evacuated from France to England after the outbreak of World War I. A period of personal tragedy followed, as Rix's sister died in 1914, then her mother in 1915. In 1916 she met and married George Matson Nicholas, only to be widowed the next month when he was killed on the Western Front.|$|E

5|$|Chabas first {{exhibited}} September Morn <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Paris</b> Salon of April 14 to June 30, 1912.

Aston Knight, Chabas won a Medal of Honor, receiving 220 of 359 possible votes. At the Salon, the painting was uncontroversial, and it was soon reprinted in American publications such as Town & Country and The International Studio.|$|E

The French emblem is a golden rooster imposed upon a red shield. Their alternative strip is composed of a white shirt and navy blue shorts and socks. French international matches are played at several venues across the country; the Stade de France <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Paris</b> suburb of Saint-Denis is used for their games during the Six Nations, and they have a formidable home record at the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille where they have only lost twice, to Argentina in 2004 and to New Zealand in 2009.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Paris</b> of the 1860s, {{despite being}} a Prix de Rome laureate, Bizet {{struggled}} to get his stage works performed. The capital's two main state-funded opera houses—the Opéra and the Opéra-Comique—followed conservative repertoires that restricted opportunities for young native talent. Bizet's professional relationship with Léon Carvalho, manager of the independent Théâtre Lyrique company, enabled him {{to bring to the}} stage two full-scale operas, Les pêcheurs de perles (1863) and La jolie fille de Perth (1867), but neither enjoyed much public success.|$|E

5|$|Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot choreographed the {{original}} version of Giselle. Perrot and Carlotta Grisi were lovers and, consequently, Perrot designed all of her dances and pantomime. Everyone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Paris</b> dance world knew that Perrot had created Grisi's dances and Coralli admitted it, but Perrot was given no official credit in the printed materials such as posters and programs. This was most likely done to prevent Perrot from collecting royalties on the ballet. Perrot liked bold touches and planned several rapid aerial swoops on wires in Act II for Giselle. Grisi was afraid of these swoops, therefore a stage hand {{was brought in to}} test them. He crashed face-first into the scenery and the swoops were dropped.|$|E
5|$|Julien (Radziwilowicz) is {{a middle-aged}} clockmaker who lives {{alone with his}} cat in a large house <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Paris</b> suburbs. Julien is blackmailing 'Madame X' (Brochet) who is {{importing}} fake antique Chinese silks, and may have murdered her sister. By chance, he meets Marie (Béart), {{a beautiful young woman}} he last saw a year ago, and they begin a passionate relationship. Though elusive, Marie agrees to move in with him; she acts strangely at times and appears absent. A mystery connects Marie to Madame X's dead sister and in uncovering Marie's secret Julien risks losing her. The film is separated into four parts, named to reflect the narrative perspective.|$|E
5|$|On 18 January 1919 the Paris Peace Conference began. The conference {{aimed to}} {{establish}} peace between the war's belligerents {{and to establish}} the post-war world. The Treaty of Versailles resulting from the conference dealt solely with Germany. This treaty, along with the others that were signed during the conference, each took their name from the suburb of Paris where the signings took place. While 70 delegates from 26 nations participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Paris</b> negotiations, representatives from Germany were barred from attending, nominally over fears that a German delegation would attempt to play one country off against the other and unfairly influence the proceedings.|$|E
