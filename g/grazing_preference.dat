5000|$|Rabbits {{have been}} widely {{discussed}} due to their influences on land composition. Bell and Watson found that rabbits show <b>grazing</b> <b>preference</b> for different plant species. [...] This preference can alter the composition of a plant community. [...] In some cases, if the preference is for a non-native, invasive plant, rabbit grazing may benefit the community by reducing non-native abundance and creating room for the native plant species to fill. When rabbits graze in moderation they can create a more complex ecosystem, by creating more variable environments that will allow for more predator-competitor relationships between the various organisms. [...] However, besides the effect on wild vegetation, rabbits destroy crops, compete with other herbivores, and can result in extreme ecological damage. Competition can be direct or indirect. The rabbits may specifically eat the competitions target food or it may inhibit the growth of grasses that other species eat. For example, rabbit grazing in the Netherlands inhibits tall grasses from becoming dominant. This in turn enhances the suitability of the pasture for brent goose. However, they may benefit predators that do better in open areas, because the rabbits {{reduce the amount of}} vegetation making it easier for those predators to spot their prey.|$|E

The main objective of the project was to investigate the connections bet - ween alpine rangeland vegetation, landscape use and <b>grazing</b> <b>preferences</b> of free ranging dairy cattle and the milk quality with regard to fatty acid composition and content of various secondary plant metabolites. Two herds in two different geographical summer farming areas were studied during three grazing seasons (2007 - 2009). Area use and <b>grazing</b> <b>preferences</b> were studied by using high frequency GPS data in combination with detailed vegetation mapping, field studies of animal behaviour, microhistological analysis of faeces, analyses of rangeland vegetation composition and records of grazed plant species. The results showed that when available, the dairy cattle preferred open areas with a vegetation rich in species, dominated by grass and herb species. Different plant groups influenced the chemical composition of the milk differently. The study concludes that milk from alpine rangelands differ from “normal” summer and winter milk in Norway by having a healthier fatty acid composition and a higher content of various secondary plant metabolites, which may be a potential for development of labelled products.

5000|$|The White Park is a medium-large, long-bodied bovine. A {{program of}} linear assessment, {{including}} 200 bulls and 300 cows, {{has been carried}} out in the UK since 1994 to define its size and conformation. The weight of a mature bull varies from 800 to 1000 kg, depending on the quality of grazing, while adult cows are typically 500 to 700 kg. Their coloration is a distinctive porcelain white with coloured (black or red) points. The horns of the cows can vary in shape, but the majority grow forwards and upwards in a graceful curve. The horns of the bulls are thicker and shorter. In their native environment in Britain, White Park cattle are known for their distinctive appearance and their <b>grazing</b> <b>preference</b> for coarse terrain. White Park cattle are well-suited to non-intensive production. Some herds are kept outside throughout the year on rough upland grazing without shelter or supplementary feed. They are docile, easy-calving, and have a long productive life. Some traits may vary depending on their location.Until recently, White Park cattle were a triple-purpose breed used for meat, milk and draught. The 3rd Lord Dynevor (1765-1852) kept a team of draught oxen, and the practice continued up to 1914. They were used as dairy cattle even more recently. Some cows were being milked in the Dynevor herd in 1951, but yields were moderate. Beef became the main product during the twentieth century, and gained a reputation as a textured meat, with excellent flavor and marbling, which commanded a significant premium in specialty markets. [...] The white park, a breed I’ve never eaten before and had always assumed was purely ornamental, was really excellent: softly chewy, with that strong, distinctive, almost corrupt flavour of proper beef A.A. Gill Several blood typing and DNA studies have revealed the genetic distinctness of White Park cattle. The colour-pointed coat pattern also appears in other cattle breeds such as the Irish Moiled, the , the Berrenda, the Nguni and the Texas Longhorn. The breeds most closely related seem to be the Highland cattle and Galloway cattle of Scotland, but the White Park [...] "is genetically far distant from all British breeds".|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{reports the}} effects of {{different}} deferments of sheep grazing on plant variables of desert steppe vegetation in Inner Mongolia during 2010 – 2012. The study was initiated in May 2010 and comprised five treatments: no grazing (UG), grazing throughout the growing season (G) and grazing deferment for 40, 50 and 60 days (40 UG, 50 UG and 60 UG) {{from the start of}} the growing season in a completely randomised block design replicated three times. The plant species were classified into two functional groups (C 3 and C 4 species) and the relationships among species composition, biomass and annual precipitation were examined in different deferments of sheep grazing. Treatment G significantly decreased the biomass of several species compared with some of the deferred treatments and treatment UG, because of differences in <b>grazing</b> <b>preferences,</b> and, consequently, decreased the aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP). Grazing deferment for 40, 50 and 60 days significantly increased C 3 -species richness and biomass compared with treatment UG, whereas <b>grazing</b> sheep’s <b>preferences</b> for C 4 plants at some growth stages compared with C 3 plants, resulted in lower species richness and biomass of C 4 plants in treatments G, 40 UG and 50 UG in a dry year. Similarly, different species responses to treatment 60 UG resulted in an increase in ANPP in a year with more precipitation during the growing season. The annual precipitation patterns strongly affected the temporal changes in biomass as well as the responses to grazing, indicating that the plant responses in the desert steppe were co-limited by grazing and precipitation.

Three groups of dairy cows (Bos taurus) were allowed to select among these six cultivars that were sown in replicates in a randomized block design with 12 plots (36. 7 by 2. 0 m). Each experiment lasted 4 d, and every day cows were offered a new field with 12 plots. Herbage intake was measured using the sward-cutting method, measuring herbage yield before and after grazing.

This thesis included a series of glasshouse experiments, a grazing experiment (examining plant parameters and animal <b>grazing</b> <b>preference)</b> and a mowing experiment. The glasshouse experiments indicated that chicory and plantain have different strategies for coping with moisture stress. The results suggest plantain may be more productive under moderate drought due to its greater shoot mass fraction, whereas chicory may be more productive and persistent under severe drought due to its greater root mass and taproot diameter. The Herb and Legume Mix accumulated greater annual dry matter when removed under Hard grazing (post-grazing residual of 4 cm) compared to Lax grazing (post-grazing residual of 8 cm). Hard grazing favoured plantain growth and persistence, while Lax grazing favoured red clover growth and resulted in chicory with a larger taproot diameter. It was concluded that grazing management decisions should be determined by ensuring optimal management of chicory. Ewe lambs displayed <b>grazing</b> <b>preference</b> for species within the Herb and Legume Mix; however this varied between seasons and was affected by the species availability, vertical access and palatability.

40|$|Large grazing ungulates—notably cattle, elk and American bison—if given {{a choice}} exhibit a <b>grazing</b> <b>preference</b> for {{regrowth}} on recently burned areas of grassland. Traditional rangeland management approaches that minimize inherent rangeland heterogeneity are increasingly understood as counter to the evolutionary history of rangeland. Heterogeneity is defi ned as variation in the characteristics of vegetation including species, biomass, and height. Recent research now fi nds an alternative approach to rangeland management through patch burning, giving a variegated texture to the grazing land and more closely simulating the earlier evolutionary pattern of much North American rangeland. Patch burning creates a mosaic of patches at varying stages of recovery from burning and grazing disturbance. Advantages include more diverse plant and animal habitats, more consistent fuel stock control, and creation of the grazing habitat preferred by both domesticated cattle and indigenous grazing species. Research sponsored by the Joint Fire Science Program (JFSP) examined whether use of patch burning to increase rangeland heterogeneity is {{a useful tool for}} wildland fi re management while also serving as a tool for rangeland conservation and improvement...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the effects of}} re-establishing seasonal cattle grazing by 0. 7 animal. ha(- 1) on vegetation in a long-term abandoned, and partly degraded, semi-natural mountain pasture in the Sumava National Park, Czech Republic. There was very uneven grazing intensity inside the locality, and <b>grazing</b> <b>preference</b> changed during the season: cattle grazed {{most of the time}} in productive but species-poor Deschampsia cespitosa swards, but changed to a species-rich Violion caninae stand {{in the middle of the}} summer. A species-rich Carex rostrata community was only grazed at the end of the season. Species-poor swards dominated by Nardus stricta and Carex brizoides were mainly used as resting areas. Both grazing and excluding from grazing had a negative effect on species diversity of the Deschampsia cespitosa swards. The soil seed bank contained only few species that are characteristic of mountain grassland communities, and seed dispersal of the target species by cattle dung was also found to be very limited. Thus both grazing and exclusion from grazing are probably of limited value for the restoration of species-rich grasslands from species-poor Deschampsia cespitosa swards in this case...|$|E
40|$|Nine {{populations of}} diploid Red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) (Erect: Turkish, Hamua and Quiñiquelli; Semi-erect: Colenso, Kenland and E 116; Prostrate: F. 2419, Astred and Turoa) {{representing}} {{material from the}} main temperate {{regions of the world}} were used in experiments conducted at Massey University (New Zealand) and INIA-La Estanzuela (Uruguay). Population seedlings were sampled under glasshouse conditions (one at each site) to raise representative samples for cloning for two field studies. Principal components were used to ensure representativeness of the sample. Field designs and statistical models were developed specifically to meet the requirements for genotype evaluation under grazing conditions, and to estimate genotypic parameters of plant characteristics influencing selective grazing behaviour. A preliminary grazing management experiment was conducted at Massey University with spaced plants (9 populations x 80 plants), where four stocking densities (2, 3, 5 and 9 sheep/ 18 m 2 for one hour) at two times of grazing (morning or evening) were imposed on the nursery, in order to determine optimum measurement of sheep <b>grazing</b> <b>preference.</b> It was found that the preferred grazing management was to graze until an average of 40 % leaf remained in the residual plant material (equivalent to a stocking density of 5 sheep/ 18 m 2) for one hour, at either morning or evening. This achieved a 94 % sampling intensity. This regime was used subsequently in the further three grazing experiments. Two spaced-planted experiments (one at each site) were conducted in three blocks of 324 plants each (9 populations x 12 genets x 3 ramets) which were completely randomised in a 0. 75 m grid in each block, using the optimum grazing management. Pre-grazing plant measurements were taken on some characters (habit, leaf size, flowering and density); while pre- and post-grazing measures were taken on others (height, spread and leafiness). Subsequently to the experimental defoliation, all plants were defoliated to a uniform 20 % leaf residual, by mob stocking. The statistical design was a diffuse randomised complete block with plants nested inside populations at the whole plot level, with a split-plot in time and pooled across sites. The results demonstrated that grazing animals were grazing selectively, rather than grazing at random: the four most grazed populations were Quiñiquelli, E 116, Kenland and Turoa and the least grazed were Astred and Turkish. The preferred populations had the highest levels of crude protein and digestibility, and the least grazed populations had the lowest values. Post-grazing leafiness was considered the most suitable morphological character to determine <b>grazing</b> <b>preference</b> because it was highly significant in the analyses of variance for the Population and Plant effects, and demonstrated heritability values > 0. 2, allowing modest genetic progress. A sward experiment was conducted at INIA-La Estanzuela with a subset of six populations sown in three blocks, each with three internal replicates of 12. 25 m 2 each and four internal sub-samples. The same random principle was applied to give a random offer to the grazing animals, but at a plot level. The efficacy of selecting for swards in spaced plant nurseries was examined through the ratio of the correlated genetic advance in swards of selecting under spaced conditions to the direct genetic advance of selecting in sward conditions. Plant density, post-grazing leafiness, difference between pre- and post-grazing leafiness, and index of intake achieved greater genetic advance when selection was done as spaced plants: while for pre- and post-grazing height the opposite result was found. For all other characters, the best conditions to select in depended on the selection intensity achievable. It is concluded that the breeding of Red clover to improve its <b>grazing</b> <b>preference</b> should not be based on simple morphological characters. Rather, it should be based on a measurement of forage removal such as post-grazing leafiness, and under spaced plant conditions, even considering that the final use is under sward conditions...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 Tansy ragwort (Senecio iacobea) is {{a widely}} {{distributed}} weed in the Pacific Northwest (U. S. A.) where it causes severe damage to the livestock industry. Sheep are highly resistant to toxic effects of ragwort, therefore, induction of ragwort preference in sheep was sought {{as a means to}} control this poisonous plant. The effect of two early exposure periods to tansy ragwort on future <b>grazing</b> <b>preferences</b> of five sheep genotypes was evaluated. Lambs were exposed at six months of age (ragwort fed fresh), and then at 15 months of age (ragwort fed as pellets). Four treatment groups were created; lambs exposed during both periods (T 1), lambs exposed only during the first period (T 2), lambs exposed only during the second period (T 3), and lambs not exposed in either period (T 4). Ragwort preferences were evaluated at 17 (Exp. l) and 19 (Exp. 2) months of age through direct grazing observation, and through plant observation before and after grazing. Experimental animals grazed in paddocks naturally infested with the weed. Results showed no treatment effects on preferences for tansy ragwort. In Exp. l consumption of the weed was so limited that comparisons were not possible between sheep genotypes nor between treatment groups. In Exp. 2 an interaction (p<. 05) among treatment groups was found for the grazing observations, but ragwort consumption was still very low. No genetic differences were seen in Exp. 2. It was concluded that different combinations of previous exposure to ragwort as evaluated in this trial did not induce preferences for the weed in adulthood. It was speculated that induction of ragwort preferences was not accomplished because of maternal absence during the exposure periods and because exposure occurred when the lambs were too old...|$|R
40|$|Grazing on {{marine macroalgae}} {{is a key}} {{structuring}} process for coral reef communities. However, ocean acidification from rising atmospheric CO 2 concentrations is predicted to adversely affect many marine animals, while seaweed communities may benefit and prosper. We tested how exposure to different pCO 2 (400, 1, 800 and 4, 000 μatm) may affect grazing on the green alga Ulva lactuca by herbivorous fish and sea urchins from the coral reefs in the northern Gulf of Aqaba (Red Sea), either directly, by changing herbivore behaviour, or indirectly via changes in algal palatability. We also determined the effects of pCO 2 on algal tissue concentrations of protein and the grazing-deterrent secondary metabolite dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). <b>Grazing</b> <b>preferences</b> and overall consumption were tested {{in a series of}} multiple-choice feeding experiments in the laboratory and in situ following exposure for 14 d (algae) and 28 d (herbivores). 4, 000 μatm had a significant effect on the biochemical composition and palatability of U. lactuca. No effects were observed at 1, 800 relative to 400 μatm (control). Exposure of U. lactuca to 4, 000 μatm resulted in a significant decrease in protein and increase in DMSP concentration. This coincided with a reduced preference for these algae by the sea urchin Tripneustes gratilla and different herbivorous fish species in situ (Acanthuridae, Siganidae and Pomacanthidae). No feeding preferences were observed for the rabbitfish Siganus rivulatus under laboratory conditions. Exposure to elevated pCO 2 had no direct effect on the overall algal consumption by T. gratilla and S. rivulatus. Our results show that CO 2 has the potential to alter algal palatability to different herbivores which could have important implications for algal abundance and coral community structure. The fact that pCO 2 effects were observed only at a pCO 2 of 4, 000 μatm, however, indicates that algal-grazer interactions may be resistant to predicted pCO 2 concentrations in the near future. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
