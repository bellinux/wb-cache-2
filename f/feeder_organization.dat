25|$|T.N.E. is {{a sophomore}} class society, {{and in a}} {{traditional}} type chapter, members were chosen {{near the end of}} their freshman or start of their sophomore year.

As juniors and seniors, they were considered honorary members and only had authority in an advisory role. The society always excluded freshmen. From the beginning, the identities of the sophomore members were kept secret. In yearbooks, the names of the sophomores appeared in code. The Alpha Chapter and legitimate chapters continue this traditional type. Several latter types of chapters developed over time: one type is that of the three-year society, adopted by chapters at many institutions without a class society system, a third type was as a <b>feeder</b> <b>organization</b> to a senior society, a fourth type was where the chapter acted as an interfraternity coordinating body, and a fifth type was as a wholly secret society, (which were usually chapters that had notorious reputations, such as the University of Alabama).|$|E

5000|$|The Czechoslovak Union of Youth had {{a tumultuous}} history {{during the late}} 1960s and 1970s. As a <b>feeder</b> <b>organization</b> for the KSČ, it faced {{many of the same}} {{problems}} the party faced in recruiting members. In the mid-1960s, less than half of all 15- to 25-year-olds were members; in the mid-1970s, fewer than one-third had joined. As {{in the case of the}} KSČ, those who joined tended to do so with their future careers in mind; secondary school and university students were overrepresented, while only a fraction of the eligible industrial and agricultural workers belonged. Furthermore, a single, centralized organization was simply an inadequate vehicle for the interests of such a diverse group. During the reform era, the Czechoslovak Union of Youth split into a number of independent associations, including the Union of High School Students and Apprentices, the Union of Working Youth, and the Union of University Students. It was not a development the party found suitable, and beginning in 1969 party leaders set about reconstituting a unified movement. During the same era, the 1968 invasion spawned a number of dissident youth organizations. In the early 1970s, these were all infiltrated and repressed by the KSČ, a policy that continued throughout the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|Class {{societies}} {{were once}} common in northeastern American colleges and universities. There were freshman, sophomore, {{junior and senior}} class societies. Membership was by class year, and cut across the fraternity membership lines. Some class societies became fraternities outside the northeast; DKE and Alpha Sigma Phi were founded as class societies. Skull & Bones and Theta Nu Epsilon were probably the most famous and successful class societies. T.N.E. is a sophomore class society, and in a traditional type chapter, members were chosen {{near the end of}} their freshman or start of their sophomore year. Once selected, the new members were active and responsible for operation of the chapter during their sophomore year. As juniors and seniors, they were considered honorary members and only had authority in an advisory role. The society always excluded freshmen.

40|$|Short-term {{international}} immersion travel connects {{participants from}} educational and religious organizations with distant suffering to build solidarity and motivate transnational civic action. It {{is a distinct}} form of transnational social action that produces a personalized, embodied experience of transformation. Despite increasing popularity, and increasing evidence that this form of travel can facilitate civic action and activism, the mechanisms behind the production, experience, and outcomes are not well known. This research examines these issues through a focus on multiple cultural processes. The research site is BorderLinks, a faith-affiliated organization that promotes immigration awareness through travel along the U. S. -Mexico border. I use participant observation with different groups (colleges, seminaries, churches), pre/post surveys with 180 participants, and interviews with participants to examine why individuals participate, how transformative experience is produced, how group styles stabilize this moment of unsettledness, the difficulties of solidarity formation, and the specific patterns of outcomes. Short-term international immersion travel is a cultural strategy of transformation that provides participants with identity shaping experiences and fits the goals of <b>feeder</b> <b>organizations</b> that prioritize personal transformation and social engagement. Recruitment through <b>feeder</b> <b>organizations</b> creates groups with distinct demographic profiles, motivational repertoires, and emotional orientations: the "toolkits of travel. " An immersion trip sits in a liminal space of culture, yet the institutional origins of groups generate group styles that guide groups through this unsettledness (Eliasoph and Lichterman 2003). Some groups "sleuth" while others "story build," resulting in different imaginations of possible future action. The encounter with migrants addresses a central question of how solidarity between international travelers and distant suffering is formed. I show the importance of two strategies of solidarity, one relational and one imaginative. Through a hike in the desert, I show the conditions for producing evoking symbols that moralize the experience into the future. I examine change in economic behavior, attitudes, and some civic activity. I use Qualitative Comparative Analysis to show which aspects of immersion travel are most responsible for change: emotional intensification, moralized situations, cognitive awareness, and/or group affiliation. For participants' narrative construction, differences in group use of reflexivity resources affect the moral extension into the future...|$|R
5000|$|Both {{the groups}} have {{completed}} discussions {{at all levels}} in their respective <b>feeder</b> <b>organizations</b> and a joint sitting {{will be held on}} December 20.The split in KNM happened in 2002 when a group, led by Hussein Madavoor, left the mother organization over a number of ideological and organizational issues. The merger is happening at a time when some Salafo outfits in the state are facing charges for allegedly radicalising the youth, though the unity talks began around one-and-a-half years ago.However, there are certain issues {{that need to be addressed}} before the merger. The most important among them are those related to Sihr (evil eye or black magic) and Djin (the ethereal being).Two opinions prevail in the Mujahid movement on the effect of Sihr on human body: One group believes that Sihr affects the body and the other says that it is just a superstitious belief. In the case of Djin, some believe that seeking the help of Djin amounts to shirk (polytheism) in all cases and the others believe that in certain cases it is only haram but not shirk.Both the Mujahid factions claim that these issues would not come in the way of reunion. [...] "There are two opinions in the Mujahid movement on these issues. But they are not the issues to be addressed in propagation of the religion," [...] said Hussein Madavoor.|$|R
50|$|Since neither LIPBA (transferrers {{and press}} operators) nor ILAE (artists and engravers) would admit the lesser skilled press <b>feeders</b> into their <b>organizations,</b> in 1898 {{there was a}} third union formed in the lithographic industry, the International Protective Association of Lithographic Apprentices and Press Feeders of the United States and Canada. In addition, no fewer than three other unions were {{established}} {{in the next two}} years, each a craft union attempting to carve out a specific niche. These included the Poster Artists' Association of America (PAAA, established 1899), the Paper Cutters Union (established 1900), and the International Association of Stone and Plate Preparers of the United States and Canada (established 1900).|$|R
40|$|Patients with late-life {{depression}} (LLD) have {{a higher}} incident of developing dementia, especially individuals with memory deficits. However, {{little is known about}} the white matter characteristics of LLD with memory deficits (LLD-MD) in the human connectome, especially for the rich-club coefficient, which is an indicator that describes the organization pattern of hub in the network. To address this question, diffusion tensor imaging of 69 participants [15 LLD-MD patients; 24 patients with LLD with intact memory (LLD-IM); and 30 healthy controls (HC) ] was applied to construct a brain network for each individual. A full-scale battery of neuropsychological tests were used for grouping, and evaluating executive function, processing speed and memory. Rich-club analysis and global network properties were utilized to describe the topological features in each group. Network-based statistics (NBS) were calculated to identify the impaired subnetwork in the LLD-MD group relative to that in the LLD-IM group. We found that compared with HC participants, patients with LLD (LLD-MD and LLD-IM) had relatively impaired rich-club organizations and rich-club connectivity. In addition, LLD-MD group exhibited lower feeder and local connective average strength than LLD-IM group. Furthermore, global network properties, such as the shortest path length, connective strength, efficiency and fault tolerant efficiency, were significantly decreased in the LLD-MD group relative to those in the LLD-IM and HC groups. According to NBS analysis, a subnetwork, including right cognitive control network (CCN) and corticostriatal circuits, were disrupted in LLD-MD patients. In conclusion, the disease effects of LLD were prevalent in rich-club <b>organization.</b> <b>Feeder</b> and local connections, especially in the subnetwork including right CCN and corticostriatal circuits, were further impaired in those with memory deficits. Global network properties were disrupted in LLD-MD patients relative to those in LLD-IM patients...|$|R
