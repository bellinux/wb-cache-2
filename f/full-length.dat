5|$|In 1858, Offenbach {{produced}} {{his first}} <b>full-length</b> operetta, Orphée aux enfers ("Orpheus in the Underworld"), which was exceptionally well received and has remained {{one of his}} most played works.

His works from this period included La belle Hélène (1864), La Vie parisienne (1866), La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein (1867) and La Périchole (1868). The risqué humour (often about sexual intrigue) and mostly gentle satiric barbs in these pieces, together with Offenbach's facility for melody, made them internationally known, and translated versions were successful in Vienna, London and elsewhere in Europe.|$|E
