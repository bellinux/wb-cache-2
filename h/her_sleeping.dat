Upon arrival, she could not get into the flat, but {{eventually}} gained access {{with the help of}} a workman, Charles Langridge. They found Plath dead of carbonmonoxide poisoning with her head in the oven, having sealed the rooms between her and <b>her</b> <b>sleeping</b> children with tape, towels and cloths.

5|$|The novella {{illustrates}} the differences perspectives can make. The stories {{told in the}} Odyssey by Nestor and Menelaus to Telemachus, and Odysseus to a Scherian court make Odysseus into a hero as he fights monsters and seduces goddesses. According to Penelope in The Penelopiad, Odysseus was a liar who drunkenly fought a one-eyed bartender then boasted it was a giant cannibalistic cyclops. Homer portrays Penelope as loyal, patient, and the ideal wife, as he contrasts her to Clytemnestra who killed Agamemnon upon his return from Troy. In The Penelopiad, Penelope feels compelled {{to tell her story}} because she is unsatisfied with Homer's portrayal of her and the other myths about <b>her</b> <b>sleeping</b> with the suitors and giving birth to Pan. She rejects the role of the ideal wife and admits she was just trying to survive. The Odyssey makes the maids into traitors who consort with the suitors. From the maids' perspective, they were innocent victims, used by Penelope to spy, raped and abused by the suitors, and then murdered by Odysseus and Telemachus. Atwood shows the truth occupies a third position between the myths and the biased points of view.|$|E

25|$|Beck and Fernandez {{traveled}} to Byron Center Road in Wyoming Township, Michigan, {{a suburb of}} Grand Rapids, where they met and stayed with Delphine Downing, a young widow with a two-year-old daughter. On February 28, Downing became agitated, and Fernandez gave <b>her</b> <b>sleeping</b> pills to calm her. The daughter witnessed Downing's resulting stupor and began to cry, which enraged Beck. Panicked, Beck choked the child but didn't kill her. Fernandez thought Downing would become suspicious if she saw her bruised daughter, so he shot the unconscious woman. The couple then stayed for several days in Downing's house. Again enraged by the daughter's crying, Beck drowned her in a basin of water. They buried the bodies in the basement, but suspicious neighbors reported the Downings' disappearances, leading the police {{to arrive at the}} door on March 1, 1949 and arrest Beck and Fernandez.|$|E
25|$|The next evening, Zack is {{preparing}} to film a scene between Stacey and another actor, Lester, {{that was supposed to}} have been with Lester and Miri. Zack is dismayed when Miri shows up and insists on shooting the scene as originally planned. In the back room, an incredulous Zack asks if she is doing this as a form of retaliation, pointing out that Stacey told him that Miri did not mind <b>her</b> <b>sleeping</b> with Zack. Miri corrects him, clarifying that she did not mind that Stacey merely made the offer to sleep with him. Perceiving this to have been some type of test, Zack admits that during the sex scene they filmed together, they were actually making love and that there was an emotional connection between them, and that he loves Miri.

25|$|In November 2010, Hirano {{posted a}} message on her Twitter account that she has had a {{pituitary}} gland tumor since junior high school. While not malignant, the tumor exerts pressure on certain motor functions, resulting in temporary memory loss, loss of vision and slurring of speech. She decided against elective surgery because the surgery would alter her nasal cavity and permanently modify her voice. To facilitate her care, she announced in April 2011 {{that she had been}} prohibited from taking on new voice acting roles in anime since some time the previous year. She still continued voicing characters for anime that received additional seasons or extended runs. In May 2011, Hirano announced via Twitter that she was no longer performing music for Lantis and has discontinued her music career until further notice. On August 2, 2011, Japanese magazine Bubka confirmed that Hirano was dismissed by Lantis due to a sex scandal involving <b>her</b> <b>sleeping</b> with several band members. Citing a need for a new agency that was more ideal with her career wishes, Hirano announced on August 12, 2011 that she left Space Craft Entertainment. On August 21, Hirano moved to the voice acting agency Grick. Days later, on August 27, Hirano posted {{a message on}} her Twitter account, confirming that she has resumed new voice acting roles in anime.|$|E
25|$|On January 14, 1910, the Rev. E. A. Schell {{came forward}} with a {{confession}} that he said Lamphere had made to him when the minister was comforting the dying man. In it, Lamphere revealed Gunness' crimes and swore {{that she was still}} alive. Shortly before his death, Lamphere had told the Reverend Schell and a fellow convict, Harry Meyers, that he had not murdered anyone, but that he had helped Gunness bury many of her victims. When a victim arrived, she made the man comfortable, charming him and cooking a large meal. She drugged his coffee and, when the man was in a stupor, she split his head with a meat chopper. Sometimes she would wait for the suitor to go to bed and enter the bedroom by candlelight and chloroform <b>her</b> <b>sleeping</b> victim. A powerful woman, Gunness would carry the body to the basement, place it on a table, and dissect it. She bundled the remains and buried these in the hog pen and the grounds about the house. She had become an expert at dissection, thanks to instruction she had received from her second husband, the butcher Peter Gunness. To save time, she sometimes poisoned her victims' coffee with strychnine. She also varied her disposal methods, sometimes dumping the corpse into the hog-scalding vat and covering the remains with quicklime. Lamphere said that if Gunness was overly tired after murdering one of her victims, she chopped up the remains and, {{in the middle of the}} night, fed the remains to the hogs.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} scenes Asylum was given was the scene {{depicting}} the death of Amanda, in which Jason ties her into <b>her</b> <b>sleeping</b> bag and hangs her over a campfire. The risk to the actor and the surrounding woodland [...] was deemed too great to physically perform the scene. Asylum created a composite of two shots to show Amanda burning to death in <b>her</b> <b>sleeping</b> bag. Instead of creating a computer generated (CGI) model of the campfire, a real campfire was filmed. Asylum compositor John Stewart blended that footage with shots of the hanging sleeping bag into a single shot. Stewart digitally altered the flames to keep continuity between frames. Another composite shot {{is used in the}} scene in which Chelsea is hit by a speedboat. Because the scene would be too dangerous for even a stuntperson to perform, Asylum digitally combined footage of Willa Ford reacting to an imaginary boat that runs over her with shots of the actual boat to create the effect.|$|E

During a dinner at a fancy restaurant with Joan's mother and Greg's parents, Greg is forced by his mother to reveal that he in fact volunteered to go back, sending Joan into a rage. She is absolutely horrified that Greg would abandon his duties as a father to head back to war, where he [...] "feels like a good man". The next morning, Joan sits him down and tells him to leave.

500|$|Part IV {{consists}} {{of only one}} chapter, which, like the book's opening chapter, is mostly composed {{of a series of}} seemingly unrelated vignettes. After an opening call for dawn to break, the remainder of the chapter {{consists of}} the vignettes [...] "Saint Kevin", [...] "Berkely and Patrick" [...] and [...] "The Revered Letter". ALP is given the final word, as the book closes on a version of her Letter and her final long monologue, in which she tries to wake <b>her</b> <b>sleeping</b> husband, declaring [...] "Rise up, man of the hooths, you have slept so long!", and remembers a walk they once took, and hopes for its re-occurrence. At the close of her monologue, ALP – as the river Liffey – disappears at dawn into the ocean. The book's last words are a fragment, but they can be turned into a complete sentence by attaching them to the words that start the book: A way a lone a last a loved a long the / riverrun, past Eve and Adam's, from swerve of shore to bend of bay, brings us by a commodius vicus of recirculation back to Howth Castle and Environs.|$|E

2500|$|The pose of Venus had {{precedents}} in {{a well-known}} classical relief called il letto di Polyclito (the Bed of Polyclitus), where the female is Psyche (though in the 16th century {{thought to be}} Venus with Vulcan).

2500|$|Bernard Marx – an Alpha-Plus sleep-learning {{specialist}} at the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre. Bernard is a misfit. He is unusually short for an Alpha; an alleged accident with alcohol in Bernard's blood-surrogate before his decanting has left him slightly stunted. Bernard's independence of mind stems more from his inferiority complex and depressive nature than from any depth of philosophical conviction. Unlike his fellow utopians, Bernard is often angry, resentful, and jealous. At times, he is also cowardly and hypocritical. His conditioning is clearly incomplete. He doesn't enjoy communal sports, solidarity services, or promiscuous sex. He doesn't even get much joy out of soma. Bernard {{is in love with}} Lenina but he doesn't like <b>her</b> <b>sleeping</b> with other men, even though [...] "everyone belongs to everyone else". Bernard's triumphant return to utopian civilisation with John the Savage from the Reservation precipitates the downfall of the Director, who had been planning to exile him. Bernard's triumph is short-lived. Success goes to his head. Despite his tearful pleas, he is ultimately banished to an island for his non-conformist behaviour.|$|E
