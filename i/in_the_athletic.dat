5|$|Davy Bisslik {{represented}} Aruba as {{a swimmer}} in the men's 100meters butterfly, {{and was the}} only male Aruban athlete participating in swimming that year. Born in Aruba, Bisslik participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>athletic</b> programs at The College of New Jersey, and attended the 2000 Sydney Olympics on Aruba's behalf in the men's 50meters freestyle, where he ranked 62nd during the qualification round. Bisslik returned to the Olympics at age 22, although he entered in a different event entirely. During the qualification round on August 19, Bisslik competed against seven other athletes. He finished the event in 57.85seconds, ranking last in his heat behind Guam's Daniel O'Keeffe (57.39seconds), who placed seventh, and Indonesia's Andy Wibowo (56.86seconds) who placed sixth. His heat was led by Czech swimmer Michal Rubáček (54.87seconds) and Uzbekistan's Oleg Lyashko (55.90seconds). Of the 59 participants in the qualification round, Bisslik ranked 56th. He did not advance to later heats.|$|E
5|$|In the army, Nurmi quickly {{impressed}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>athletic</b> competitions: While others marched, Nurmi ran {{the whole}} distances {{with a rifle}} {{on his shoulder and}} a backpack full of sand. Nurmi's stubbornness caused him difficulties with his non-commissioned officers, but he was favoured by the superior officers, despite his refusal to take the soldier's oath. As the unit commander Hugo Österman was a known sports aficionado, Nurmi and few other athletes were given free time to practice. Nurmi improvised new training methods in the army barracks; he ran behind trains, holding on to the rear bumper, to stretch his stride, and used heavy iron-clad army boots to strengthen his legs. Nurmi soon began setting personal bests and got close for the Olympic selection. In March 1920, he was promoted to corporal (alikersantti). On 29 May 1920, he set his first national record on the 3000 m and {{went on to win the}} 1500 m and the 5000 m at the Olympic trials in July.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of his father's death in 1901, the family fortunes were at a low ebb and Bruce went into the family business after leaving high school. The young Bruce was ambitious and determined to get an education. With loaned money, {{he moved to the}} United Kingdom with his mother and sister and enrolled in Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1902. He was a popular if average student, heavily involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>athletic</b> life of the college, including {{as a member of the}} Cambridge rowing crew that won the Boat Race in 1904. Rowing remained one of his great passions, and he continued to coach crews (including several for the Henley Royal Regatta) and write on the subject for much of his life. Ernest Bruce had remained in Australia to take charge of the family's business interests. In 1906, he lobbied the directors of the company to have his brother Stanley take over the chairmanship of Paterson, Laing and Bruce, and was ultimately successful. Despite being just 23, he proved an able chairman, and with Stanley in London managing the exporting and financial interests, and Ernest managing the importation and sales operations in Melbourne, the financial fortunes of the business and the family rapidly recovered. During these years, Bruce also trained and worked as a solicitor and then as a barrister in the London with the firm of Ashurst, Morris, Crisp & Co. His work for the firm took him to Mexico in 1908 and Colombia in 1912, which fostered an interest in international affairs.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the economy}} and the remote {{location}} of Los Angeles, participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>athletic</b> events of the 1932 Games was lower than that of 1928. The art competition did not suffer from this problem, and the number of art works entered remained stable. Their exhibition drew 384,000 visitors to the Los Angeles Museum of History, Science and Art. Art contests were also held in Berlin (1936) and London (1948), with reasonable success, although the number of entered works had significantly dropped by 1948.|$|E
25|$|From 1912 to 1948 {{rules of}} the art {{competition}} varied, but {{the core of the}} rules remained the same. All of the entered works had to be inspired by sport, and had to be original (that is, not be published before the competition). Like <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>athletic</b> events at the Olympics, gold, silver, and bronze medals were awarded to the highest ranked artists, although not all medals were awarded in each competition.

25|$|Suddenly, in 1988, it {{all came}} {{crashing}} down for Switzer. His team was placed on probation by the NCAA for violating several rules.

Switzer's house was robbed {{with the help of}} one of his athletes, and an athlete was caught attempting to sell drugs to an undercover agent. The three-year probation included a two-year ban on TV and bowl appearances and a reduction in scholarships from 25 to 18. Nonetheless, the 1988 team established the NCAA Division I single-game record of 768yards rushing against Kansas State on October 15, 1988, a record that stands to this day. After the season, Switzer resigned as head coach.|$|E
25|$|Wooden's team {{repeated}} {{as national}} champions in 1965 with Gail Goodrich, Kenny Washington, and Doug McIntosh, when the Bruins upended Dave Strack's Michigan team 91–80 in the final.

The 1966 squad was denied {{a chance at}} a triple crown, finishing second to Oregon State <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Athletic</b> Association of Western Universities (now the Pac-12). UCLA was ineligible to play in the NCAA tournament that year, because in those days only conference champions were guaranteed a bid to the tournament. The Bruins' 1967 incarnation returned with a vengeance with sophomore star Alcindor, reclaiming not only the conference title, but the national crown with another 30–0 season, and then retaining it every season but one until Wooden's retirement immediately following the 1975 NCAA championship.|$|E
