5|$|The work {{is divided}} into 37 books, {{organised}} into ten volumes. These cover topics including astronomy, mathematics, geography, ethnography, anthropology, <b>human</b> <b>physiology,</b> zoology, botany, agriculture, horticulture, pharmacology, mining, mineralogy, sculpture, painting, and precious stones.|$|E
5|$|Outer space {{represents}} a challenging environment for human exploration {{because of the}} dual hazards of vacuum and radiation. Microgravity also has {{a negative effect on}} <b>human</b> <b>physiology</b> that causes both muscle atrophy and bone loss. In addition to these health and environmental issues, the economic cost of putting objects, including humans, into space is very high.|$|E

5|$|After {{multiple}} {{years and}} failed petitions, Mother 3 was reannounced for the Game Boy Advance in 2003 within a Japanese television commercial for Mother 1+2, a port of Mother and Mother 2 to the Advance. The game kept its original story {{and received a}} graphical overhaul in a pixelated style similar to Mother 2. The game's themes included <b>human</b> <b>physiology,</b> renewal, and fungibility on the morality spectrum. Its music was composed by Shogo Sakai, and retained the quirky style of series composers Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka. Mother 3 was released on April 20, 2006 in Japan, whereupon it became a bestseller. It has not been released outside Japan.|$|E
5|$|Analysis is the {{activity}} of breaking an observation or theory down into simpler concepts {{in order to understand}} it. Reductionism can refer to one of several philosophical positions related to this approach. One type of reductionism is the belief that all fields of study are ultimately amenable to scientific explanation. Perhaps a historical event might be explained in sociological and psychological terms, which in turn might be described in terms of <b>human</b> <b>physiology,</b> which in turn might be described in terms of chemistry and physics. Daniel Dennett distinguishes legitimate reductionism from what he calls greedy reductionism, which denies real complexities and leaps too quickly to sweeping generalizations.|$|E

25|$|In <b>human</b> <b>physiology</b> and psychology, {{sound is}} the {{reception}} of such waves and their perception by the brain. Humans can hear sound waves with frequencies between about 20Hz and 20kHz. Sound above 20kHz is ultrasound and below 20Hz is infrasound. Other animals have different hearing ranges.|$|E
25|$|In 1799 the British chemist Humphry Davy {{performed}} another early blind experiment.

40|$|This thesis validates a control-oriented {{model of}} human circulatory {{dynamics}} associated with hemorrhage and fluid resuscitation, uses this model {{to design a}} series of closed-loop controllers for fluid resuscitation, and demonstrates the viability of these controllers by examining the performance of these controllers in an established model of <b>human</b> cardiovascular <b>physiology.</b> First, a recently developed control-oriented model of hemorrhage and fluid resuscitation was validated across diverse physiological conditions using an established model of <b>human</b> cardiovascular <b>physiology,</b> by employing a system identification procedure. Second, a series of closed-loop controllers were designed based on the nominal control-oriented model, including proportional control and proportional-derivative control based on the root locus analysis, as well as observer-based optimal state feedback control based on modern control theory. Third, the performance and robustness of the designed closed-loop controllers were validated using the established model of <b>human</b> cardiovascular <b>physiology.</b> The results suggested that model-based closed-loop control may be {{a viable alternative to}} today’s manual fluid infusion practices...|$|R
25|$|Another {{significant}} {{program was}} its Medical Sciences Division, which extensively funded women's contraception {{and the human}} reproductive system in general. Other funding went into endocrinology departments in American universities, human heredity, mammalian biology, <b>human</b> <b>physiology</b> and anatomy, psychology, and the studies of human sexual behavior by Dr. Alfred Kinsey.|$|E

25|$|Negrón’s {{knowledge}} of <b>human</b> <b>physiology</b> {{and the behavior}} of the human body in space led her back to the field of scientific inquiry. In 2015, She began to conduct research on digital simulation with virtual reality. Her research was conducted with Daniel Archilla and they hope that their research will lower the expensive cost of the technology involved and that it will encourage the development of better technologies.|$|E
25|$|Cholesterol is {{susceptible}} to oxidation and easily forms oxygenated derivatives known as oxysterols. Three different mechanisms can form these: autoxidation, secondary oxidation to lipid peroxidation, and cholesterol-metabolizing enzyme oxidation. A great interest in oxysterols arose when they were shown to exert inhibitory actions on cholesterol biosynthesis. This finding {{became known as the}} “oxysterol hypothesis”. Additional roles for oxysterols in <b>human</b> <b>physiology</b> include their participation in bile acid biosynthesis, function as transport forms of cholesterol, and regulation of gene transcription.|$|E
25|$|As {{indicated}} in their individual Wikipedia pages, 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (which, like 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid, acts through the OXER1 receptor), 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid, 12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 15-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and 20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid show numerous activities in animal and human cells {{as well as}} in animal models that are related to, for example, inflammation, allergic reactions, cancer cell growth, blood flow to tissues, and/or blood pressure. However, their function and relevancy to <b>human</b> <b>physiology</b> and pathology have not as yet been shown.|$|E

25|$|Most {{aspects of}} <b>human</b> <b>physiology</b> are closely {{homologous}} to corresponding aspects of animal physiology. The human body {{consists of the}} legs, the torso, the arms, the neck, and the head. An adult human body consists of about 100 trillion (1014) cells. The most commonly defined body systems in humans are the nervous, the cardiovascular, the circulatory, the digestive, the endocrine, the immune, the integumentary, the lymphatic, the musculoskeletal, the reproductive, the respiratory, and the urinary system.|$|E
25|$|The Department of Veterinary Physiology and Pharmacology has {{multiple}} missions {{in the areas}} of teaching, research, and service with an emphasis on both veterinary and <b>human</b> <b>physiology</b> and pharmacology. Teaching responsibilities within the department fall into three general categories: 1) undergraduate instruction leading to the Bachelor of Science degree in Biomedical Science, 2) graduate instruction leading to the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy degrees in Biomedical Science and the Doctor of Philosophy degree in Toxicology and 3) professional instruction leading to the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree.|$|E
25|$|On {{retiring}} from the RAF, Ernsting became a visiting professor at King's College London (KCL), where he taught a human and applied physiology Master of Science course. Later, KCL asked him to establish a research laboratory. He was active both in research and in training undergraduate and postgraduate students for 16 years. In addition to his position at KCL, he was a visiting professor at Imperial College, London. In 1998, Ernsting was appointed Head of the <b>Human</b> <b>Physiology</b> and Aerospace Medicine Group of the Guy's, King's and St Thomas's School of Biomedical Sciences.|$|E
