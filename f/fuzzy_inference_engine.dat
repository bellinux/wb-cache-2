The original idea inspired Giovanni Acampora to create FML was the necessity of creating a cooperative fuzzy-based framework aimed at automatically controlling a living environment characterized by a plethora of heterogeneous devices whose interactions were devoted to maximize the human comfort under energy saving constraints. This framework represented {{one of the first}} concrete examples of Ambient Intelligence. Beyond this pioneering application, the major advantage of using XML to describe a fuzzy system is hardware/software interoperability. Indeed, all that is needed to read an FML file is the appropriate schema for that file, and an FML parser. This markup approach makes it much easier to exchange fuzzy systems between software: for example, a machine learning application could extract fuzzy rules which could then be read directly into a <b>fuzzy</b> <b>inference</b> <b>engine</b> or uploaded into a fuzzy controller. Also, with technologies like XSLT, it is possible to compile the FML into the programming language of your choice, ready for embedding into whatever application you please. As stated by Mike Watts on his popular Computational Intelligence blog:"Although Acampora's motivation for developing FML seems to be to develop embedded fuzzy controllers for ambient intelligence applications, FML could be a real boon for developers of fuzzy rule extraction algorithms: from my own experience during my PhD, I know that having to design a file format and implement the appropriate parsers for rule extraction and fuzzy inference engines can be a real pain, taking as much time as implementing the rule extraction algorithm itself. I would much rather have used something like FML for my work." ...|$|E

40|$|Rotary cranes (tower cranes) {{are common}} {{industrial}} structures {{that are used}} in building construction, factories, and harbors. These cranes are usually operated manually. With the size of these cranes becoming larger and the motion expected to be faster, the process of controlling them has become difficult without using automatic control methods. In general, the movement of cranes has no prescribed path. Cranes have to be run under different operating conditions, which makes closed-loop control attractive. In this work a fuzzy logic controller is introduced with the idea of 2 ̆ 2 split-horizon 2 ̆ 2; that is, <b>fuzzy</b> <b>inference</b> <b>engines</b> (FIE) are used for tracking the position and others are used for damping the load oscillations. The controller consists of two independent sub-controllers: radial and rotational. Each of these controllers has two <b>fuzzy</b> <b>inference</b> <b>engines</b> (FIE). Computer simulations are used to verify the performance of the controller. Three simulation cases are presented. In the first case, the crane is operated in the gantry (radial) mode in which the trolley moves along the jib while the jib is fixed. In the second case (rotary mode), the trolley moves along the jib and the jib rotates. In the third case, the trolley and jib are fixed while the load is given an initial disturbance. The results from the simulations show that the fuzzy controller is capable of keeping the load-oscillation angles small throughout the maneuvers while completing the maneuvers in relatively reasonable times...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The Neuro-Fuzzy {{hybridization}} scheme {{has become}} of research interest in pattern classification {{over the past}} decade. The present paper proposes a novel Modified Adaptive <b>Fuzzy</b> <b>Inference</b> <b>Engine</b> (MAFIE) for pattern classification. A modified Apriori algorithm technique is utilized to reduce a minimal set of decision rules based on input output data sets. A TSK type fuzzy inference system is constructed by the automatic generation of membership functions and rules by the fuzzy c-means clustering and Apriori algorithm technique, respectively. The generated adaptive <b>fuzzy</b> <b>inference</b> <b>engine</b> is adjusted by the least-squares fit and a conjugate gradient descent algorithm towards better performance with a minimal set of rules. The proposed MAFIE is able {{to reduce the number}} of rules which increases exponentially when more input variables are involved.

In a previous paper, we demonstrate a layered URC architecture can implement these types of systems, but did not provide a method for computing the weights. In this follow-on paper, we provide a Fourier-based algorithm for computation of the weights. We also prove that this technique is optimal {{in the sense that}} the mean-square approximation error is minimized for a fixed amount of resources. Finally, through the course of an example, we explore implementation issues and evaluate the overall effectiveness of the technique. I...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{viewpoint}} {{of this paper}} is based on the hypothesis that human expert know-how is represented and stored in natural fuzzy linguistic terms. Know-how is obtained by the summarization of numerous experiences {{over a long period of}} time and expressed with a set of fuzzy IF-THEN rules. This paper describes the electronic circuits, both in current and voltage modes including semiconductor chips that were developed from 1980 – 1997, and dedicated to fuzzy information processing.

40|$|The Mamdani and TSK fuzzy {{models are}} <b>fuzzy</b> <b>inference</b> <b>engines</b> {{which have been}} most widely applied in {{real-world}} problems. Compared to the Mamdani approach, the TSK approach is more convenient when the crisp outputs are required. Common to both approaches, when a given observation does not overlap with any rule antecedent in the rule base (which usually termed as a sparse rule base), no rule can be fired, and thus no result can be generated. Fuzzy rule interpolation was proposed to address such issue. Although {{a number of important}} fuzzy rule interpolation approaches have been proposed in the literature, all of them were developed for Mamdani inference approach, which leads to the fuzzy outputs. This paper extends the traditional TSK <b>fuzzy</b> <b>inference</b> approach to allow inferences on sparse TSK fuzzy rule bases with crisp outputs directly generated. This extension firstly calculates the similarity degrees between a given observation and every individual rule in the rule base, such that the similarity degrees between the observation and all rule antecedents are greater than 0 even when they do not overlap. Then the TSK fuzzy model is extended using the generated matching degrees to derive crisp inference results. The experimentation shows the promising of the approach in enhancing the TSK <b>inference</b> <b>engine</b> when the knowledge represented in the rule base is not complete...|$|R

30|$|The fuzzy-based rules map {{the input}} and output {{membership}} functions. The <b>fuzzy</b> <b>inference</b> <b>engine</b> is based on fuzzy IF-THEN-based rules, which are ultimately written by a professional designer in the related field.

These memberships are connected using special fuzzy logic operators. In our case, we used the AND operator (minimum (x, y, z,)) of 27 rules when designing the fuzzy IF-THEN-based rules for our <b>fuzzy</b> <b>inference</b> <b>engine,</b> as shown in Table  1.

In this paper, an online signature verifi- cation system is proposed based on <b>fuzzy</b> logic <b>inference.</b> To ensure higher accuracy, the signature verification system is designed to include the fusion of multi classifiers, namely, the back propagation neural network algorithm and the Pearson correlation technique. A <b>fuzzy</b> logic <b>inference</b> <b>engine</b> is also designed to fuse two global features which are the time taken to sign and the length of the signature.
