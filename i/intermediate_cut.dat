40|$|Starting {{from the}} fact that stand {{structure}} is significantly disturbed and from the assumption that all stands of pedunculate oak at forest level older than 100 years are potentially considered for stand regeneration, it is obvious that forest planning and management have to define their priorities on the basis of which individual, potentially mature and mature stands, will be regenerated. The general objective {{of this paper is to}} research the structure and mutual impacts of stand, site and economic factors on the elements of stand structure in a greater area of pedunculate oak forests consisting of old or potentially mature pedunculate oak stands with a disturbed structure. Based on obtained structural relations, the goal was to determine by modeling the easily obtainable elements of the variable (model), which will represent the objective criterion for stand ranking according to the regeneration priority and structural and economic requirements. The subject of the research are pedunculate oak forests in the Central Posavina region, where 37 stands, with stocking of less than 0. 8, were randomly selected and divided into 3 age groups (101 – 120 years, 121 – 135 years, > 135 years) in 16 management units. On a total of 146 established plots of 25 m radius, estimates and measurements were carried out of variables at the level of individual model trees (6 trees of the main species – upper storey layer – nearest to the plot centre) and of stand and site variables (2 breast-height diameters, crown diameter, tree height, base height of the crown and height of the widest part of the crown, varietal trunk structure, crown defoliation, increment core, breast-height diameter of all trees higher than 1. 3 m, seedlings, potential intermediate cutting, died trees, diameters of stump of cut trees, shrub layer, microrelief, canopy, health status, litter, understorey vegetation). The estimated and measured data were processed and appropriate variables for data analysis derived. The complex potential revenue (rent) difference was defined for stand regeneration (Equation 3) as a dependent variable and objective criterion for stand ranking according to regeneration priority. By means of partial linear analyses, multivariate analysis and modeling (generalized linear modeling), mutual and complex impacts of stand, site and economic factors on elements of stand structure and potential revenue (rent) difference were investigated. Statistical analyses were performed by application of the SAS software package, whereas descriptive statistics, correlation analyses, integration of functions and development of graphical presentations were carried out by means of the STATISTICA 8. 2 software package. The research included different management, stand and structural characteristics (Table 1) and determined a statistically significant mutual impact of individual variables of stand, site and economic factors on certain elements of stand structure and potential revenue (rent) difference (Table 2). Multivariate analysis revealed models of complex impacts of stand, site and economic factors on standing volume of pedunculate oak and revenue (rent) difference (Table 3). According to the obtained data, all three models are statistically significant for the estimated standing volume of pedunculate oak and also for the estimated revenue (rent) difference. The stand factors in total account for 35 % variability of standing volume of pedunculate oak and for 22 % variability of revenue (rent) difference. The site factors account for 39 % variability of standing volume of pedunculate oak and for 34 % variability of revenue (rent) difference, whereas economic factors account for even 45 % variability of standing volume of pedunculate oak and for 43 % variability of revenue (rent) difference. The results of the Tukey post hoc (HSD) test for statistically significant variables of multivariate analysis of the revenue (rent) difference and the standing volume of pedunculate oak (Table 4) indicate that there exists a relation between the standing volume of pedunculate oak as a complex structure element and the potential revenue (rent) difference. The results proved the existence of a direct impact of individual elements of main tree species as well as a complex impact of structure elements on the variable of potential revenue (rent) difference (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). The standing volume of pedunculate oak as a complex structure element is a suitable dependent variable, along with the revenue (rent) difference, for comparative analysis of impacts of statistically significant stand, site and economic factors on stand regeneration priority. Due to a significantly smaller standing volume of pedunculate oak as a consequence of its disturbed structure, there is a higher regeneration priority for the youngest stand group (100 to 119 years) in comparison with the older stands. Accordingly, in forests with disturbed structure age cannot be an objective criterion for planning stand regeneration. Stands with disturbed canopy of understorey layer with the smallest and lowest value of standing volume expectedly have the highest regeneration priority, i. e. their maintenance would lead to both economic losses and disturbed site conditions. In view of site preservation, the problem is particularly marked in case of pure stands, where pedunculate oak trees do not cover the soil in a sufficient measure, and have a worsening tendency due to weakening and dying of trees. According to the obtained results, which indicate that there is a relation between site and standing volume of pedunculate oak and revenue (rent) difference, stands with better site have lower regeneration priority. This is related to the fact that stand structure on a higher quality site is characterized by a lower number of pedunculate oak trees of larger dimensions and potentially large value increase, which is also characteristic of forest communities of pedunculate oak and common hornbeam. On average, a smaller standing volume of pedunculate oak in a floodplain pedunculate oak forest and a higher regeneration priority indicate disturbed structure conditions. Due to hydro-ameliorative works, this community has suffered even greater site changes and is more in danger of dieback, so regeneration will be more difficult and expectably less successful in case of stands with disturbed site and structure conditions, both at early and delayed regeneration. Regarding the proportional relation between the quantity of prescribed cut and the standing volume of pedunculate oak, stands with better structure and higher prescribed <b>intermediate</b> <b>cut</b> are expected to have a lower regeneration priority. A prescribed cut below 15 m 3 /ha (50 % sampled plots) indicates a significant share of preserved stands left to natural development, with necessary felling of only weak and dying trees by the beginning of regeneration or recovery. The stand structure characteristics according to their belonging to individual management units are more a consequence of spatial differences in site and structure conditions than a management characteristic. Thus we can separate 3 management units in the centre of the Lonjsko polje floodplain (Žutica, Kutina floodplain forests and Brezovica), where dieback of pedunculate oak was the highest and which have a more marked stand regeneration priority in comparison to the management units with a more preserved structure of old stands (Trstika, Josip Kozarac). The impact of individual structure elements of pedunculate oak, unlike the rent, has a high correlation, with the exception of numbers of pedunculate oak trees. This can be explained by the fact that the same number of pedunculate oak trees can represent very different structural relations in terms of average dimensions of pedunculate oak trees, basal area and standing volume of pedunculate oak as well as different rate of other tree species in the structure. A particular significance with regards to the application of the results can be seen in the fact that easily obtainable structural elements, such as pedunculate oak basal area, number of pedunculate oak trees and diameter increment of pedunculate oak, proved to be very good indicators, which can explain nearly 70 % variability of the complex impact on the revenue (rent) difference. The obtained research results prove the existence of a direct relation between stand structure and regeneration priority. There is, therefore, a practical possibility to apply the established complex variable of revenue (rent) difference for ranking of stands or stand parts (stand dividing) according to regeneration priority, which can be determined by means of easily obtainable elements of structure (tree numbers, basal area and diameter increment of pedunculate oak). An extension of the research into site-structure relations to include a greater, or even the entire area of pedunculate oak forests in Croatia as well as spatial and multiobjective forest management criteria (spatial distribution and area of stands for regeneration, habitat requirements) for stand regeneration planning would be a welcome continuation of this work...|$|E

Na 146 ploha polumjera 25 m provedena je procjena i izmjera varijabli na razini pojedinačnih modelnih stabala, varijabli sastojine, te stanišnih i gospodarskih varijabli. Obradom podataka, parcijalnim linearnim i multivarijatnim analizama te modeliranjem istraživan je utjecaj strukturnih značajki na prioritet obnove. Rezultati su istraživanja potvrdili statistički značajnu ovisnost između sastojinskih, stanišnih i gospodarskih čimbenika, strukture sastojina i razlike budućih potencijalnih prihoda. Oni pokazuju postojanje neposredne veze između strukture sastojine i prioriteta obnove. Starije su sastojine hrasta lužnjaka (100 – 120 godina) narušenije strukture i imaju veći prioritet obnove.

40|$|The BcgI {{endonuclease}} exemplifies {{a subset}} of restriction enzymes, the Type IIB class, which make two double-strand breaks (DSBs) at each copy of their recognition sequence, one {{either side of the}} site, to excise the sequence from the remainder of the DNA. In this study, we show that BcgI is essentially inactive when bound to a single site and that to cleave a DNA with one copy of its recognition sequence, it has to act in trans, bridging two separate DNA molecules. We also show that BcgI makes the two DSBs at an individual site in a highly concerted manner. <b>Intermediates</b> <b>cut</b> {{on one side of the}} site do not accumulate during the course of the reaction: instead, the DNA is converted straight to the final products cut on both sides. On DNA with two sites, BcgI bridges the sites in cis and then generally proceeds to cut both strands on both sides of both sites without leaving the DNA. The BcgI restriction enzyme can thus excise two DNA segments together, by cleaving eight phosphodiester bonds within a single-DNA binding event...|$|R

40|$|Possibly, {{the greater}} {{availability}} of nutrients {{in the soil}} will promote a more pronounced modification of the growth form of forage plant under high frequency of defoliation.

Marandu (marandu palisade grass) submitted to cutting intervals and fertilization, as well as the effect of these modifications on the forages removed and remnant from the cut. This study was carried out in two experimental periods. In each period, independent yet similar in nature experiments were performed. In Experiment 1, from October 2013 to February 2014, marandu palisade grass was fertilized with 70 kg. ha- 1  of N and 50 kg. ha- 1  of P 2 O 5  and cut intervals (7, 14, 28, 56, and 112 days) were evaluated in a randomized complete block design with four replications. In Experiment 2, from November 2014 to March 2015, in addition to the same cut intervals evaluated in Experiment 1, two fertilization conditions were also studied, one of which was low (50 kg. ha- 1  of P 2 O 5  and 75 kg. ha- 1  of N) and another one that was high (100 kg. ha- 1  of P 2 O 5  and 300 kg. ha- 1  of N). In Experiment 2, a factorial scheme with two levels of fertilization and five levels of cut intervals was used in a randomized block design with four replications. In Experiment 1, the highest indexes of horizontality (IH) occurred (p< 0. 05) in the plants under cut intervals of 7, 14 and 28 days, in relation to the plants cut every 56 and 112 days. In Experiment 2, only the plant cut every 7 days showed an increase of IH (from 1. 3 to 1. 5) (p< 0. 05) with the improvement of the high fertilization condition. The remaining forage mass increased (p< 0. 05) with the cut interval, from 412 to 483 g. m- 2  and from 412 to 571 g. m- 2  in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively. In Experiment 2, there was an increase (p< 0. 05) in the remaining forage mass (from 447 to 505 g. m- 2) and the percentage of live stem (from 23 to 33 %) with fertilization at all cut intervals. In both experiments, the highest cut intervals increased (p< 0. 05) the forage mass removed (from 95 to 840 g. m- 2  and from 44. 8 to 843 g. m- 2  in experiments 1 and 2, respectively) and leaf area index (LAI) removed (from 1. 0 to 4. 3 and from 0. 4 to 3. 9 in experiments 1 and 2, respectively). In Experiment 2, the improved fertilization condition resulted in an increase (p< 0. 05) in the forage mass removed (from 261. 3 to 391. 8 g. m- 2) and LAI removed (from 1. 6 to 2. 1). In Experiment 2, when the fertilization condition was high, there was (p< 0. 05) less percentage of live leaf removed in the canopies under <b>intermediate</b> <b>cuts</b> (28 and 56 days). When defoliation is very frequent, the greater availability of nutrients in the soil contributes to the marandu palisade grass to modify its form of growth from upright to prostrate, compared to the condition of less availability of nutrients in the soil.

The smaller subtree units are less sensitive to the basic event ordering during BDD conversion. BDDs are constructed for every subtree. Qualitative analysis is performed on the set of BDDs to obtain the minimal cut sets for the original top event. It is shown how to extract the minimal cut sets from complex and modular events in order to obtain the minimal cut sets of the original fault tree in terms of basic events...|$|R

When complex systems are studied conventional methods can become computationally intensive and require the use of approximations. This leads to inaccuracies in evaluating system reliability. To overcome such disadvantages, the binary decision diagram (BDD) method has been developed. This method improves accuracy and efficiency, because the exact solutions can be calculated without the requirement to calculate minimal cut sets as an <b>intermediate</b> phase. Minimal <b>cut</b> sets can be obtained if needed. BDDs are already proving to be of considerable use in system reliability analysis. However, the difficulty is with the conversion process of the fault tree to the BDD. The ordering of the basic events can have a crucial effect {{on the size of the}} final BDD, and previous research has failed to identify an optimum scheme for producing BDDs for all fault trees. This paper presents an extended strategy for the analysis of complex fault trees. The method utilizes simplification rules that are applied to the fault tree to reduce it to a series of smaller subtrees whose solution is equivalent to the original fault tree.

6000|$|... § XXIII. As {{the scale}} of Plate III. is {{necessarily}} small, I have given three of the sculptured triangles {{on a larger scale}} in Plate IV. opposite. Fig. 3 is one of the four in the lower series of Plate IV., and figs. 4 and 5 from another group. The forms of the trefoils are here seen more clearly; they, and all the other portions of the design, are thrown out in low and flat relief, the <b>intermediate</b> spaces being <b>cut</b> out to the depth of about a quarter of an inch. I believe these vacant spaces were originally filled with a black composition, which is used in similar sculptures at St. Mark's, and of which I found some remains in an archivolt moulding here, though not in the triangles. The surface of the whole would then be perfectly smooth, and the ornamental form relieved by a ground of dark grey; but, even though this ground is lost, the simplicity of the method insures the visibility of all its parts at the necessary distance (17 or 18 feet), and the quaint trefoils have a crispness and freshness of effect which I found it almost impossible to render in a drawing. Nor let us fail to note in passing how strangely delightful to the human mind the trefoil always is. We have it here repeated five or six hundred times {{in the space of a}} few yards, and yet are never weary of it. In fact, there are two mystical feelings at the root of our enjoyment of this decoration: the one is the love of trinity in unity, the other that of the sense of fulness with order; of every place being instantly filled, and yet filled with propriety and ease; the leaves do not push each other, nor put themselves out of their own way, and yet whenever there is a vacant space, a leaf is always ready to step in and occupy it.|$|R
40|$|International audienceHydrate {{formation}} and remediation in oil flowlines facilities represent {{a major concern}} for oil industry in respect of capital and operational costs. It is necessary {{to have a better}} understanding on the hydrate formation process to be more efficient in hydrate prevention, especially in respect to additive dosage. This work is a contribution to enhance the knowledge of hydrate formation at high water cuts, by introducing new techniques of analysis in the Archimede flow loop: a Focus Beam Reflectance Measurement (FBRM) probe and a Particle Video Microscope (PVM) probe. These results will be supported by Pressure Drop, Flow Rate, Density and Temperature probes. From experimental observations, a method to determine the continuous phase (water or oil) of the system under flowing is proposed. It is based on the time evolution of the most representative chord class measured by the FBRM. In order to predict morphology and size of hydrates, a topological model was developed. It represents hydrate crystallization from different emulsion systems with and without low dosage of hydrate inhibitor additive (anti-agglomerant type). The key parameters are the gas transfer rate at the gas/liquid interface and at the hydrocarbon/water interface, {{and the role of the}} hydrocarbon as gas transfer phase. Gas/liquid transfer is low as water phase remains the continuous phase, but is enhanced as hydrocarbon content is increased. Hydrocarbon gas transfer property is depleted as continuous and rigid crust is formed around droplets, especially in well dispersed emulsions. This behavior is highlighted for experiments without anti-agglomerant additive (AA-LDHI) and at high water cut, as a small fraction of hydrocarbon is well dispersed in the water continuous phase. The maximum hydrate plugging risk is in between 70 % and 30 % water <b>cut</b> (<b>intermediate</b> and low water cut). In this work, experiments at high water cuts (more than 80 %) never plug. In order to prevent agglomeration, the AA-LDHI works better if it shows a secondary surfactant benefit, well-dispersing the droplets (and later the formed hydrates) in the continuous phase, which was identified as being preferentially the hydrocarbon phase...|$|R

The dry matter (DM) concentration of HS was greater than that of the control (202 v. 167 g DM per kg; P < 0. 01). WSC and in-vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) were 243 and 161 g/kg DM, and 0. 61 and 0. 56 for HS and control, respectively. In contrast, acid- and neutral-detergent fibre were 251 and 296 g/kg DM and 480 and 563 g/kg DM for HS compared with control, respectively. DM intake was increased (9. 3 v. 6. 7 kg/day; P < 0. 001) for HS animals and this contributed significantly towards higher flows of non-ammonia N to the duodenum as well as increased absorption of amino acids from the small intestine. This DM intake response was partly due to the elevation in DM concentration of HS. However fresh weight intake was increased proportionately by ca. 0. 15 (P < 0. 05) in animals on HS compared with control. Rumen ammonia levels were lower (14. 0 and 26. 4 mg N per l; P < 0. 001) and concentrations of rumen propionate higher (P < 0. 01) and acetate lower (P < 0. 01; increasing the glucogenic: lipogenic volatile fatty acid ratio) in animals on HS compared with control.

40|$|This paper {{points out}} that while many {{developing}} countries seek to increase their export earnings, they have not embraced fully the notion that their own pattern of import protection hurts their export performance. The paper quantifies {{the extent to which}} import protection acts as a tax on a country''s export sector and finds that for many developing countries, the magnitude of the implicit tax is substantial-about 12 percent, on average, for the countries studied. The paper also illustrates the effects of various tariff-cutting scenarios in the Doha Round on export incentives and concludes that, in general, developing countries could increase their export earnings by reducing their own import tariffs, but countries must be careful about how these tariff reductions are achieved. For example, tariff-cutting schemes that exempt certain sectors could actually be harmful.

40|$|The main objetive of this Doctoral Thesis was {{to study}} the {{influence}} of female castration and pig sex on growth performance and carcass and meat quality of white pigs slaughtered at different final weights. Three experiments (Exp.) were conducted. In Exp. 1, a total of 200 (Landrace * Large White dam x Pietrain * Large White sire) gilts of 50 ± 3 days of age (23. 3 ± 1. 47 kg BW) was used to investigate the effects of castration (intact females, IF vs. castrated feamles, CF) and slaughter weight (106 vs. 122 kg BW) on productive performance and carcass and meat quality. There were four experimental treatments arranged as a 2 x 2 factorial and 5 replicates of 10 pigs each per treatment. Half of the gilts were ovariectomized at 58 d of age (8 days after {{the beginning of the}} trial; 29. 8 ± 1. 64 kg BW) whereas the other half remained intact. Meat samples were taken at m. Longissimus thoracis {{at the level of the}} last rib and subcutaneous fat samples were taken at the tail insertion. For the entire experiment period, CF had higher BW gain (P< 0. 05) and backfat and m. Gluteus medius (GM) fat thickness (P< 0. 001) than IF. However, IF had higher loin and trimmed primal cut yields (P< 0. 05) than CF. Meat quality was similar for IF and CF but the proportion of linoleic acid in subcutaneous fat was higher (P< 0. 001) for IF. Pigs slaughtered at 122 kg BW had higher (P< 0. 001) feed intake and poorer feed efficiency than pigs slaughtered at 106 kg BW. An increase in slaughter weight (SW) improved (P< 0. 001) carcass yield but decreased (P< 0. 05) trimmed primal cut yield. Meat from females slaughtered at the heavier BW was redder (a*; P< 0. 001) and had more (P< 0. 01) intramuscular fat and less thawing (P< 0. 05) and cooking (P< 0. 10) loss than meat from females slaughtered at the lighter BW. Also, females slaughtered at 122 kg BW had less (P< 0. 01) linoleic acid content in the subcutaneous fat than pigs slaughtered at 106 kg BW. Castration of gilts and slaughtering at heavier BW might be useful practices for the production of heavy pigs destined to the dry cured industry in which a certain amount of fat in the carcass is required. In contrast, when the carcasses are destined to fresh meat production, IF slaughtered at 106 kg BW are a more efficient alternative. In Exp. 2, crossbred pigs (n= 240) from Pietrain*Large White sires mated to Landrace*Large White dams with an average of 100 d of age (60. 5 ± 2. 3 kg) were used to investigate the effects of gender and slaughter weight (SW) on growth performance and carcass and meat quality characteristics. There were 6 treatments arranged factorially with 3 genders (IF vs. CF vs. castrated males, CM) and 2 SW (114 vs. 122 kg BW). Each of the 6 combinations of treatments was replicated 4 times and the experimental unit was a pen with 10 pigs. Castrated males and CF ate more feed, grew faster and had more carcass backfat depth and fat thickness at the GM muscle, but lower loin yield than IF (P< 0. 05). In addition, CF and CM had more intramuscular fat (P< 0. 05) and less linoleic acid content in the subcutaneous fat (P< 0. 01) than IF. Pigs slaughtered at 122 kg BW had lower ADG (P< 0. 05), poor gain-to-feed ratio (P< 0. 05), and more GM fat than pigs slaughtered at 114 kg BW (P < 0. 05). It is concluded that CF and CM had similar productive performance and meat quality characteristics when slaughtered at the same age, and that the castration of females improved daily gains and increased weight and fat content of primal cuts with respect to IF. Therefore, castration of females is recommended in pigs destined to the dry-cured industry because of the beneficial effects on the quality of the primal cuts. In Exp. 3, the effects of gender and castration of females (IF vs. CF vs. CM) on performance and carcass and meat quality were studied in crossbred pigs (Landrace x Large White dams x Duroc sires) slaughtered at 119. 2 (trial 1) or 131. 6 (trial 2) kg BW. Intact females had better feed conversion and less carcass fat than CF and CM. Trimmed shoulder yield was higher for CM than for CF with IF being <b>intermediate.</b> Primal <b>cut</b> yield and meat quality, however were similar for all treatments. Proportion of linoleic acid in backfat was lower for CF than for IF or CM, and the differences were significant in pigs slaughtered witn 131. 6 kg BW. The higher fat content and the fatty acid profile favour the use of CF and CM over IF for the production of heavy pigs destined to the dry-cured industry...|$|R

As análises laboratoriais consistiram na determinação da matéria seca (MS), matéria orgânica, matéria mineral, proteína bruta (PB), extrato etéreo, lignina, fibra em detergente neutro (FDN), FDN corrigida para cinzas e proteína, fibra em detergente ácido (FDA), proteína insolúvel em detergente neutro, proteína insolúvel em detergente ácido e proteína solúvel em detergente neutro. Os nutrientes digestíveis totais (NDT) foram calculados por intermédio da composição química. As frações B 2, C e a taxa de digestão da fibra, bem como a repleção ruminal, foram estimadas através de parâmetros cinéticos obtidos a partir da incubação in situ. O avanço da idade de corte propiciou aumento nos teores de MS em 9, 5 %. As variedades intermediárias apresentaram NDT {{superior}}es às precoces, as quais destacaram-se pelos mais elevados teores de FDN e FDA, cujos respectivos valores foram 487, 56 e 471, 03, e 287, 87 e 247, 54 g/kg MS para as variedades precoces e intermediárias, respectivamente. O NDT aumentou linearmente com a idade de corte, variando de 62, 45 a 63, 50 %; contudo, os teores de FDN e FDA apresentaram comportamento quadrático. As variedades precoces apresentaram maior teor de PB que as intermediárias somente na idade ao corte de 549 dias, contrariamente, o teor de brix foi superior para as variedades intermediárias no último corte. As variedades precoces apresentaram maior repleção ruminal total e menor taxa de digestão da fibra. A fração B 2 da fibra, foi reduzida e a C foi linearmente aumentada com a idade das plantas. The {{objectives of}} this work were to determine the chemical composition, the potentialy degradable fraction of NDF (B 2) and undegradable fraction (C) and to estimate the ruminal fill of sugar cane with different cycles of production (early and <b>intermediate),</b> in three <b>cut</b> times (426, 487 and 549 days). The laboratorial analysis consisted in dry matter (DM), organic matter, ash, crude protein (CP), ether extract, lignin, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), neutral detergent fiber corrected for ash and protein, acid detergent fiber (ADF), neutral detergent insoluble protein, acid detergent insoluble protein and neutral detergent protein soluble. The TDN was calculated by chemical composition. The degradable and undegradable fractions, and fiber digestion rate, {{as well as the}} ruminal fill were estimated by kinetic parameters obtained throught in situ incubation. The advanced cut time increased the DM in 9. 5 %. The intermediate varieties presented higher TDN than early varieties, which had the highest contents of NDF and ADF, whose respective values were 487. 56 and 471. 03, and 287. 87 and 247, 54 g/kg DM for the early and intermediate varieties, respectively. The TDN increased linearly with the cut time, varying from 62. 45 to 63. 50 %; however the NDF and ADF contents presented quadratic behavior. The early varieties presented higher content of CP than the intermediate only in the cut time of 549 days; contrarily, the brix of the sugar cane was superior to the intermediate varieties in the last cut.

40|$|Este trabalho foi conduzido com o objetivo de determinar as frações e as taxas de degradação dos carboidratos em cultivares de cana-de-açúcar, com dois ciclos de produção: precoce e intermediário, em três idades de corte (426, 487 e 549 dias). No fracionamento, foram calculados os carboidratos totais (CT), carboidratos não-fibrosos (CNF) e as frações potencialmente degradável (B 2) e não-degradável (C) da fibra em detergente neutro (FDN), corrigida para cinzas e proteína (FDNcp). Os parâmetros cinéticos dos CNF e fração B 2 foram estimados a partir da técnica da produção de gás in vitro. Os teores de CT e fração B 2 não diferiram entre os ciclos de produção, porém as precoces apresentaram maiores teores da fração C e menores dos CNF. Estabelecendo uma relação entre concentração de lignina obtida e fração C observada, por meio de ajuste de equação de regressão linear simples, sem intercepto, obteve-se o valor de 4, 38, que diferiu de 2, 4, sugerido pelo sistema Cornell. Portanto, para cana-de-açúcar, a fração C pode ser mais precisamente estimada a partir da lignina multiplicada por 4, 38. O avanço da idade de corte causou aumento da fração C e redução da B 2, sem interagir com a maturação; embora tenha sido linear, o incremento foi pequeno, de apenas 6 % da fração C, quando comparado a outras gramíneas tropicais com a mesma idade de corte. Os parâmetros cinéticos não apresentaram diferenças entre variedades; entretanto, as taxas de degradação dos CNF foram inferiores às sugeridas pelo sistema Cornell. O ajuste da curva de produção cumulativa de gás (sistema bicompartimental) mostrou-se adequado, pois a cana-de-açúcar tem frações de carboidratos disponíveis muito distintas quanto à taxa de digestão (CNF e B 2). Por apresentar elevado teor de CNF e baixa taxa de degradação da fração B 2, pesquisas com diferentes fontes de N para suplementar dietas à base de cana-de-açúcar são necessárias. The {{objective}} of this work {{was to determine the}} fractions and rates of degradation of the carbohydrates for sugar cane, with different cycles of production (early and <b>intermediate),</b> in three <b>cut</b> times (426, 487 and 549 days). The total carbohydrates (TC), non-fibrous carbohydrates (NFC), fractions potentially digestible (B 2) and indigestible (C) of the neutral detergent fiber (NDF), corrected for ashes and protein (NDFcp), were obtained. The kinetic parameters of NFC and fraction B 2 were obtained from the technique of in vitro gas production. The contents of TC and fraction B 2 did not differ among varieties, even though the early ones showed higher contents of the fraction C and smaller of NFC. By establishing a relationship between concentration of obtained lignin and observed C fraction, with adjustment of equation of simple linear regression, without intercept, it was obtained the value of 4. 38, that differed of 2. 4, suggested by the Cornell system. Therefore, for sugar cane, the fraction C could be estimated from the lignin multiplied by 4. 38. The progress of the cut time caused linear increase of the C fraction and reduction of B 2, without interaction with the cycle of production; although it has been linear, the increment was relatively small, 6 % of the fraction C, when compared to the other tropical gramineas, with the same cut time. The kinetic parameters did not show differences among varieties; however, the estimated average digestion rates for NFC were lower than the suggested by the Cornell system. The adjustment of the curve of cumulative gas production (bicompartimental system) was shown appropriate because the sugar cane has fractions of available carbohydrate very different with relationship to the degradation rate (CNF and B 2). By presenting high content of NFC (sucrose) and low rate of degradation of the B 2 fraction, researches with different sources of N to supplement sugar cane based diets are necessary...|$|R
