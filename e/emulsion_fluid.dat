A great orb of liquid, the world was {{populated}} by great drifting beasts used as habitats for the mensch, with its own [...] "Seasun" [...] at the center. An appendix for Serpent Mage describes this liquid as not actually water, but a fluid which can be breathed through lungs and gills. Chelestra was also intended as a tremendous waste management and recycling plant, with the great floating habitat-beasts called [...] "durnai" [...] serving as biological recycling stations for the detritus from the other worlds. However, strange serpents, creatures of great power and corruption - that the Sartan had not created - began to appear. The Sartan could not account for their existence, but their danger was undeniable. Even worse, the <b>emulsion</b> <b>fluid</b> of Chelestra had a neutralizing effect on Sartan rune magic, rendering it and them utterly powerless. Surrounded by water that took away their power, no longer in control of the mensch, and faced with the serpents, the Sartan of Chelestra retreated into their capital. Samah, fearing {{what would happen if the}} serpents spread to the other worlds, shut Death's Gate, cutting communication between the worlds. The Sartan then placed themselves into a stasis sleep, expecting it to only last long enough for the other worlds to finish their parts of the grand plan and come help. This contributed to the disappearance of the Sartan from the mensch worlds, setting up the main series' events.|$|E
40|$|The {{degree of}} {{stability}} {{of a certain}} emulsion can be measured by several methods. An invert <b>emulsion</b> <b>fluid</b> is composed of brine emulsified into oil. The applied shear breaks the brine phase into droplets, which could be stabilized {{by the action of}} the emulsifier. The stability of the emulsion in most cases is linked to the homogeneity and fineness of the brine-dispersed droplets. In this study, solid-free emulsion muds were prepared from 25 % CaCl 2 brine emulsified into low toxic diesel oil. The effects of the shear rate and shear time factors on the stability of these muds were evaluated. Five muds with different oil/water ratios were tested under five different shearing rates and five different shearing times. Shearing rates of 1945 to 3359 sec- 1 were applied, and the shearing time was between 30 and 120 min. Oil/water ratio was varied from 90 : 10 to 50 : 50. Electric stability, filtration loss, separation test, and mud viscosity were used as the criteria that determine emulsion stability. The variation of filtration loss, electric stability, and mud viscosity versus shear force were quantified. Also the effect of oil/water ratio variation on these properties was tested. The results show a clear trend of the effect of shear rate and shear time on these properties and consequently on emulsion stability. Several correlations were developed to calculate the value of these properties and consequently the stability degree of the emulsion. King Saud Universit...|$|E

The aim in the conception {{of this process is}} to propose a new rapid way to obtain <b>emulsions</b> from supercritical <b>fluid</b> extracts. Nowadays the conventional emulsion formulation method is a two-step procedure, i. e. first supercritical fluid extraction for obtaining an extract; secondly emulsion formulation using another device.

Results obtained using this technique provided evidence of surfactant depletion in oil <b>emulsion</b> <b>fluids</b> as a result of growth of a mixed fungal inoculum, but this effect was not recorded when these isolates were grown in synthetic fluids. Synthetic metal working fluds of known composition were formulated and the ability of selected fungal isolates to utilise both these fluids and the individual components thereof as sole sources of carbon and nitrogen was assessed. The metal working fluid components triethanolamine and diethanolamine borate were found to be readily available nutrient sources for growth of the isolates, the extent of growth being limited by the availability of carbon rather than nitrogen. Varying the initial pH of the medium was found to have no significant effect upon the extent of growth recorded at initial pH values of 7. 0, 8. 0 and 9. 0. The use of respirometric techniques provided evidence to suggest that some of the enzymes involved in the fungal degradation of synthetic metal working fluid components might be inducible. The effect of fungal growth upon the composition of the complete synthetic metal working fluids was determined using the techniques of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gas—liquid chromatography linked mass spectrometry.

These studies show that the aqueous activity of either a water-base or oil-base <b>emulsion</b> drilling <b>fluid</b> can be adjusted to cause water to enter or be extracted from a low-permeability shale. The relative activities developed at downhole conditions determine the chemical potential driving force that will either support or suppose any hydrolic potential driving force caused by a difference between the borehole pressure and the formation pore pressure. If borehole pressure exceeds the far-field pore pressure, ionic water-base drilling fluids permit water entry and weakening of a shale unless the activity as masured at ambient conditions is far less than that of the shale. Even if water is extracted from the shale, borehole stability {{has been found to be}} reduced. In contrast, oil-base <b>emulsion</b> drilling <b>fluids</b> extract water from a shale and maintain borehole stability if the ambient activity is equal to or less than that of the shale. The use of a nonionic polyol monomer (methyl glucoside) to reduce the activity of fresh water results in a drilling fluid that acts very similar to an oil-base emulsion in extracting water from shale and maintaining borehole stability. The results provide guidance for the development of a new class of water-base fluids that can be an environmentally acceptable alternative to hydrocarbon-base fluids for drilling troublesome shales. ...|$|R

There are some investigations on designing of biodiesel-based drilling fluids, but most of them are about water-free system instead of emulsion system which is the most commonly used. In this paper, a biodiesel-based invert <b>emulsion</b> drilling <b>fluid</b> (BBDF) was prepared and its properties were evaluated.

Great care was taken to keep the relevant dimensionless numbers constant during the scaling-up. The experimental data were interpreted in terms of theoretical drop break-up theory. It was found that both viscous and inviscid mechanisms can deform the drop. When a drop is exposed to a high-energy eddy, the deformation process proceeds rapidly.

The Flexure-based Microgap Rheometer (FMR) is a shear-rate-controlled device capable of measuring the shear stress in a plane Couette type sliding plate setup with directly-controlled gaps between 1 m and 200 m over 5 decades of shear rate. This configuration then allows us to determine the microgap-dependent flow behavior of complex fluids such as mayonnaise and cosmetic emulsions which exhibit yield stress characteristics. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Although {{the use of}} oil-in-water (O/W) <b>emulsions</b> as {{metalworking}} <b>fluids</b> is widespread, {{the mechanisms}} of emulsion lubrication are not yet well understood. Several theories have been proposed {{but there is not}} a clear agreement about the effect of different operating conditions and emulsion properties on the lubricating performance of O/W emulsions. In the present study, the film forming ability of O/W emulsions as a function of emulsifier concentration is studied. The emulsifier content exerts a strong influence on all the emulsion properties, such as stability, droplet size distribution, surface and interfacial tension, wetting ability, etc., {{as well as on the}} lubricating behaviour, so it has been used to ascertain the relationship between all the properties involved. Three different emulsifiers—anionic, nonionic and cationic—were used at different concentrations in the design of lubricant O/W emulsions. Experimental results show that the work of adhesion of oil droplets on the metal surface is a valuable parameter to predict the ability of emulsions to form thick films in elastohydrodynamic (EHD) contacts. The influence of pH value of O/W emulsions on their lubricating behaviour is also verified. The overall conclusion is that the interactions between metal and oil droplets rule the mechanism of lubrication and that this interaction is primarily controlled by emulsifier concentration...|$|R
