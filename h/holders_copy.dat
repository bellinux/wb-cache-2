How user innovations become commercial products: a theoretical investigation and case study Carliss Baldwin*, Christoph Hienerth* * and Eric von Hippel*** In this paper we model the pathways commonly traversed as user innovations are transformed into commercial products. First, one or more users recognize a new set of design possibilities and begin to innovate. They then join into communities, motivated by the increased efficiency of collective innovation. User-manufacturers then emerge, using high variable cost / low-capital production methods. Finally, as user innovation slows, the market stabilizes enough for high-capital, low variable cost manufacturing to enter. We test the model against the history of the rodeo kayak industry and find it supported. We discuss implications for “dominant design ” theory and for innovation practice...|$|R

Many studies highlight the challenges facing incumbent firms in responding effectively to major technological transitions. While some authors argue that these challenges can be overcome by firms possessing what have been called “dynamic capabilities, ” little work has described in detail the critical resources that these capabilities leverage, or the processes through which these resources accumulate and evolve. This paper explores these issues through an in-depth exploratory case study of one firm that has demonstrated consistently strong performance in an industry that is highly dynamic and uncertain. The focus for our study is Microsoft, the leading firm in the software industry. We motivate our focus on Microsoft by providing evidence that the firm’s product performance has been consistently strong {{over a period of time}} in which there have been several major technological transitions – one indicator that a firm possesses dynami...|$|R

Overview This working paper offers a longitudinal and descriptive analysis of the strategies of multinationals from developed countries in developing countries. The central argument is that strategies were shaped by the trade-off between opportunity and risk. Three broad environmental factors determined the trade-off. The first was the prevailing political economy, including the policies of both host and home governments, and the international legal framework. The second was the market and resources of the host country. The third factor was competition from local firms. The impact of these factors on corporate strategies is explored, as shown in Fig. 1, during the three eras in the modern history of globalization from the nineteenth century until the present day. The performance of specific multinationals depended {{on the extent to which}} their internal capabilities enabled them to respond to these external opportunities and threats...|$|R

It discusses the integrated risk management framework, emphasizing the connections between the three fundamental ways a company can implement its risk management objectives: modifying the firm’s operations, adjusting its capital structure, and employing targeted financial instruments. “Integration ” refers both to {{the combination of these}} three risk management techniques, and to the aggregation of all risks faced by the firm. The paper offers a functional analysis of integrated risk management using a wide set of illustrative situations to show how the risk management process influences, and is influenced by, the overall business activities and the strategy of the firm.

H&R Block’s Refund Anticipation Loan: A Paradox of Profitability?* Some firms comprehend the enormous potential that exists for providing services to the growing low income segment. Operating in the low-income market has numerous complications, such as designing an efficient distribution and servicing system, offering simple and “easy to consume ” products, and training a sales force. In addition, vendors of products for the poor often must enter into a contentious, long-standing and irresolvable debate about appropriate levels of profit and consumer protection. Regardless of the merits of these debates, firms can find themselves bedeviled by complicated interactions with non-customers, including consumer advocates, the press, courts and regulators. The experiences of H&R Block, a $ 4. 2 billion income tax preparation and financial services firm headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri, illustrate some of these costs. Block sells a highly profitable “Refund Anticipation Loan ” (RAL...|$|R

Specifically, products are often said to “mirror ” the architectures of the organizations from which they come. This dynamic occurs because an organization’s problem solving routines and normal patterns of communication tend to constrain the space of designs within which it searches for new solutions. Such a link, if confirmed empirically, would be important, given that product architecture {{has been shown to be}} an important predictor of product performance, product variety, process flexibility and industry evolution. We explore this relationship in the software industry by use of a technique called Design Structure Matrices (DSMs), which allows us to visualize the architectures of different software products and to calculate metrics to compare their levels of modularity. Our research takes advantage of a natural experiment in this industry, where product...|$|R

While one might reason that employees {{willing to take on}} the increased risk should do so, holding company stock is inefficient for all employees, even risk tolerant ones. This paper investigates the extent of company stock ownership within defined contribution pension plans and estimates its cost, finding that employee investors sacrifice an average 42 % of their company stock’s market value by taking on risk that could otherwise have been “diversified away. ” Significant losses occur even at levels of company stock ownership that fall within the newly-proposed legislative limits. By matching with cash rather than stock, firms could reduce that lost value, making both employees and the firm better off. Risk tolerant employees who want to “swing for the fences ” should instead diversify their portfolios and lever them to the desired risk levels...|$|R

In particular, designs which are modular in nature are argued to be more “evolvable, ” in that these designs facilitate making future adaptations, the nature of which do not have to be specified in advance. In essence, modularity creates “option value ” with respect to new and improved designs, which is particularly important when a system must meet uncertain future demands. Despite the conceptual appeal of this research, empirical work exploring the relationship between modularity and evolution has had limited success. Three major challenges persist: first, it is difficult to measure modularity in a robust and repeatable fashion; second, modularity is a property of individual components, not systems as a whole, hence we must examine these dynamics at the microstructure level; and third, evolution is a temporal phenomenon, in that the conditions at time t affect the nature o...|$|R

Economists and psychologists rely on widely divergent assumptions about human behavior in constructing their theories. Economists tend to assume that people are fully rational, while psychologists, particularly behavioral decision researchers, identify the systematic ways in which people depart from rationality. Yet, while the two disciplines have offered different predictions of how individuals react to external stimuli, behavioral decision researchers and economists have shared the implicit assumption that individuals will accurately perceive the stimuli available to them. In this paper, we argue that people actually often fail to perceive and process stimuli easily available to them. In other words, we challenge the tacit assumption that awareness is unbounded and provide evidence that humans regularly fail to see and use stimuli and information easily available to them. We call this phenomenon “bounded awareness ” (Bazerman and Chugh, 2005). Herbert Simon introduced bounded rationality as a “behavioral model (in which...|$|R

Private Equity and Industry Performance Shai Bernstein, Josh Lerner, Morten Sørensen and Per Strömberg * The growth of the private equity industry has spurred concerns about its potential impact on the economy more generally. This analysis looks across nations and industries {{to assess the impact of}} private equity on industry performance. Industries where PE funds have invested in the past five years have grown more quickly in terms of productivity and employment. There are few significant differences between industries with limited and high private equity activity. It is hard to find support for claims that economic activity in industries with private equity backing is more exposed to aggregate shocks. The results using lagged private equity investments suggest that the results are not driven by reverse causality. These patterns are not driven solely by common law nations such as the United Kingdom and United States, but also hold in Continental Europe...|$|R

Recent scholarship has demonstrated, often through carefully researched cases, that institutions can and sometimes do change. According to this research, there are two primary factors that can cause institutions to change. First, institutional entrepreneurs, including individual actors or small group of actors, are able to think and act outside the confines of their institutional context, and therefore, mobilize change in directions that favor new sets of interests (for a review, see Battilana, 2010). A second factor which contributes to institutional change are the processes endogenous to the everyday functioning of institutions, such as the loose coupling between formal and informal practices or the contested meanings in the adoption of new practices (Leblibici, et. al, 1991; Lounsbury and Pollack, 2001). While both research approaches have been quite productive and provocative, some scholars have raised concerns about this turn in institutional research. They {{point out that there}} is a theoretical inconsistency between th...|$|R

Taking risk management theory seriously* We study a firm that justifies its novel use of equity derivatives as a cash-flow hedging strategy. Our purpose is to understand the challenge of translating risk management theory into managerial action. Cephalon Inc., a biotech firm, bought a large block of call options on its own stock. If the FDA approved the firm’s new drug, the firm would have large cash needs, which the options were designed to meet. We analyze this stated rationale for the firm’s choice, applying the cash flow hedging concepts articulated by Froot, Scharfstein and Stein (1993). In applying the theory to practice, there are lessons for both managers and theorists. Managers consider deadweight costs of financing and of risk management, whereas theory tends to ignore the latter costs. While theory is driven by costs of external financing, managers must measure these costs to arrive at decisions and this measurement problem is severe. Cephalon’s risk management decisions see...|$|R
