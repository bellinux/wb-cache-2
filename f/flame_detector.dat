25|$|Hydrogen {{has one of}} {{the widest}} explosive/ignition mix range with air of all the gases with few {{exceptions}} such as acetylene, silane, and ethylene oxide. That means that whatever the mix proportion between air and hydrogen, a hydrogen leak will most likely lead to an explosion, not a mere flame, when a flame or spark ignites the mixture. This makes the use of hydrogen particularly dangerous in enclosed areas such as tunnels or underground parking. Pure hydrogen-oxygen flames burn in the ultraviolet color range and are nearly invisible to the naked eye, so a <b>flame</b> <b>detector</b> is needed to detect if a hydrogen leak is burning. Hydrogen is odorless and leaks cannot be detected by smell.|$|E

50|$|The cone {{of vision}} of a <b>flame</b> <b>detector</b> is {{determined}} by the shape and size of the window and the housing and the location of the sensor in the housing. For infrared sensors also the lamination of the sensor material plays a part; it limits the cone of vision of the <b>flame</b> <b>detector.</b> A wide cone of vision does not automatically mean that the <b>flame</b> <b>detector</b> is better. For some applications the <b>flame</b> <b>detector</b> needs to be aligned precisely to take care that it does not detect potential background radiation sources. The cone of vision of the <b>flame</b> <b>detector</b> is three dimensional and is not necessarily perfectly round. The horizontal angle of vision and the vertical angle of vision often differ; this is mostly caused by the shape of the housing and by mirroring parts (meant for the self test). Different combustibles can even have a different angle of vision in the same <b>flame</b> <b>detector.</b> Very important is the sensitivity at angles of 45°. Here at least 50% of the maximum sensitivity at the central axis must be achieved. Some flame detectors here achieve 70% or more. In fact these flame detectors have a total horizontal angle of vision of more than 90°, but most of the manufacturers do not mention this. A high sensitivity on the edges of the angle of vision provides advantages for the projection of a <b>flame</b> <b>detector.</b>|$|E

50|$|Near {{infrared}} (IR) array <b>flame</b> <b>detectors</b> (0.7 to 1.1 µm), {{also known}} as visual <b>flame</b> <b>detectors,</b> employ <b>flame</b> recognition technology to confirm fire by analyzing near IR radiation using a charge-coupled device (CCD). A near Infrared(IR) sensor is especially able to monitor flame phenomena, without too much hindrance from water and water vapour. Pyroelectric sensors operating at this wavelength can be relatively cheap. Multiple channel or pixel array sensors monitoring flames in the near IR band are arguably the most reliable technologies available for detection of fires. Light emission from a fire forms {{an image of the}} flame at a particular instant. Digital image processing can be utilized to recognize flames through analysis of the video created from the near IR images.|$|R
50|$|The {{range of}} a <b>flame</b> <b>detector</b> is highly {{determined}} by the mounting location. In fact, when making a projection, one should imagine in what the <b>flame</b> <b>detector</b> “sees”. A rule of thumb is, that the mounting height of the <b>flame</b> <b>detector</b> is {{twice as high as}} the highest object in the field of view. Also the accessibility of the <b>flame</b> <b>detector</b> must be taken into account, because of maintenance and/or repairs. A rigid light-mast with a pivot point is for this reason recommendable. A “roof” on top of the <b>flame</b> <b>detector</b> (30 x 30 cm, 1 x 1-foot) prevents quick pollution in outdoor applications. Also the shadow effect must be considered. The shadow effect can be minimized by mounting a second <b>flame</b> <b>detector</b> in the opposite of the first detector. A second advantage of this approach is, that the second <b>flame</b> <b>detector</b> is a redundant one, in case the first one is not working or is blinded. In general, when mounting several flame detectors, one should let them “look” to each other not let them look to the walls. Following this procedure blind spots (caused by the shadow effect) can be avoided and a better redundancy can be achieved than if the flame detectors would “look” from the central position into the area to be protected. The range of flame detectors to the 30 x 30 cm, 1 x 1-foot industry standard fire is stated within the manufacturers data sheets and manuals, this range can be affected by the previously stated de-sensitizing effects of sunlight, water, fog, steam and blackbody radiation.|$|E

40|$|Presented in {{this paper}} is a new flame monitor that uses three {{photovoltaic}} cells covering UV, visible and IR spectral bands respectively. A gain adjustable amplifier is incorporated into the monitor {{so that it is}} applicable to coal, oil or gas fired flames. Selfchecking of the monitor is implemented through cross-correlation of the signals from the three cells and hence no additional selfchecking hardware is required. Both flickering frequency and brightness of the flame are determined to monitor flame stability and to detect flame presence as well as sighting tube blockage. Unlike conventional single cell <b>flame</b> <b>detectors,</b> the new multi-cell device can still be in operation before being repaired after a cell-failure alarm has gone off.

50|$|A <b>flame</b> <b>detector</b> is {{a sensor}} {{designed}} {{to detect and}} respond to the presence of a flame or fire, allowing flame detection. Responses to a detected flame depend on the installation, but can include sounding an alarm, deactivating a fuel line (such as a propane or a natural gas line), and activating a fire suppression system. When used in applications such as industrial furnaces, their role is to provide confirmation that the furnace is properly lit; in these cases they take no direct action beyond notifying the operator or control system. A <b>flame</b> <b>detector</b> can often respond faster and more accurately than a smoke or heat detector due to the mechanisms it uses to detect the flame.|$|E
50|$|Infrared flame {{detectors}} suffer from Infrared heat radiation {{which is not}} emitted by the possible fire. One could say that the fire can be masked by other heat sources. All objects which have a temperature higher than the absolute minimum temperature (0 kelvins or −273.15 °C) emit energy and at room temperature (300 K) this heat is already {{a problem for the}} infrared {{flame detectors}} with the highest sensitivity. Sometimes a moving hand is sufficient to trigger an IR <b>flame</b> <b>detector.</b> At 700 K a hot object (black body) starts to emit visible light (glow). Dual- or multi-infrared detectors suppress the effects of heat radiation by means of sensors which detect just off the CO2 peak; for example at 4.1 µm. Here it is necessary that there is a large difference in output between the applied sensors (for example sensor S1 and S2 in the picture). A disadvantage is that the radiation energy of a possible fire must be much bigger than the present background heat radiation. In other words, the <b>flame</b> <b>detector</b> becomes less sensitive. Every multi infrared <b>flame</b> <b>detector</b> is negatively influenced by this effect, regardless how expensive it is.|$|E

5000|$|The sun emits an {{enormous}} amount of energy, which would be harmful to human beings if not for the vapours and gases in the atmosphere, like water (clouds), ozone, and others, through which the sunlight is filtered. In the figure it can clearly be seen that [...] "cold" [...] CO2 filters the solar radiation around 4.3 µm. An Infrared detector which uses this frequency is therefore solar blind. Not all manufacturers of flame detectors use sharp filters for the 4.3 µm radiation and thus still pick up quite an amount of sunlight. These cheap flame detectors are hardly usable for outdoor applications. Between 0.7 µm and approx. 3 µm there is relatively large absorption of sunlight. Hence, this frequency range is used for flame detection by a few <b>flame</b> <b>detector</b> manufacturers (in combination with other sensors like ultraviolet, visible light, or near infrared). The big economical advantage is that detector windows can be made of quartz instead of expensive sapphire. These electro-optical sensor combinations also enable the detection of non-hydrocarbons like hydrogen fires without the risk of false alarms caused by artificial light or electrical welding.|$|E

5000|$|More typical systems {{incorporate}} a digital cellular communication unit that will contact the central station (or some other location) via the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) {{and raise the}} alarm, either with a synthesized voice or increasingly via an encoded message string that the central station decodes. These may connect to the regular phone system on the system side of the demarcation point, but typically connect on the customer side ahead of all phones within the monitored premises so that the alarm system can seize the line by cutting-off any active calls and call the monitoring company if needed. A dual signalling system would raise the alarm wirelessly via a radio path (GPRS/GSM) or cellular path using the phone line or broadband line as a back-up overcoming any compromise to the phone line. Encoders can be programmed to indicate which specific sensor was triggered, and monitors can show the physical location (or [...] "zone") of the sensor on a list or even {{a map of the}} protected premises, which can make the resulting response more effective.
