Its primary nurturers are young African Trinidadian Males By the 1950 s, with the support of governmental offices and the sponsorship of Trinidadian industries, pan had begun to be recognized, legitimized, and embraced by all communities and classes.  (Garland Encyclopedia of World Music, Vol. 2, 1998 : 962) Session {{consists of a}} single recording.

40|$|Production from {{unconventional}} reservoirs {{has gained}} an increased attention among operators in North America during past {{years and is}} believed to secure the energy demand for next decades. Economic production from unconventional reservoirs is mainly attributed to realizing the complexities and key fundamentals of reservoir formation properties. Geomechanical well logs (including well logs such as total minimum horizontal stress, Poisson’s ratio, and Young, shear, and bulk modulus) are secured source to obtain these substantial shale rock properties. However, running these geomechanical well logs for the entire asset is not a common practice {{that is associated with}} the cost of obtaining these well logs. In this study, synthetic geomechanical well logs for a Marcellus shale asset located in southern Pennsylvania are generated using data-driven modeling. Full-field geomechanical distributions (map and volumes) of this asset for five geomechanical properties are also created using general geostatistical methods coupled with data-driven modeling. The results showed that synthetic geomechanical well <b>logs</b> and real <b>field</b> <b>logs</b> fall into each other when the input dataset has not seen the real <b>field</b> well <b>logs.</b> Geomechanical distributions of the Marcellus shale improved significantly when full-field data is incorporated in the geostatistical calculations...|$|R

40|$|The primary aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} heterogeneity in the mineralogical composition of mudstones resulting from input (detrital, production and diagenetic) variability. With this aim four formations were examined with three unique investigations. [...] Heterogeneity {{as a result of}} diagenesis in the Exshaw Formation (Devonian-Carboniferous) was investigated with a focus on the sulfur cycles influence on mudstone composition. Heterogeneity related to the carbon cycles influence on source and reservoir characteristics of mudstones was analyzed by comparing two carbonate-rich mudstone units (i) the Utica Shale (Ordovician) and (ii) the Winterhouse Formation (Ordovician). The Benbulben Shale (Devonian-Carboniferous) was utilized as a natural laboratory to investigate the scale of heterogeneity in mudstones. [...] Accurately evaluating fine-grained rocks requires investigating rock properties on a sub-centimetre scale; therefore in all formations lithofacies variability was measured with both petrographic (transmitted light, SEM) and geochemical methods (XRD, XRF, TOC and δ¹³C in addition to <b>field</b> <b>logging...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We propose {{artificial}} boundary {{conditions for the}} wave equation considered outside cylindrical computational domains of a high aspect ratio. Such domains can arise in many practical problems, e. g. - as to logging problems - while one develops <b>logging</b> tools, interprets <b>field</b> <b>logs</b> etc. An exact condition on the side boundary is obtained analytically from the representation of a general solution to the wave equation in Fourier series. The discrete counterpart to this non-local condition is generated so that it has recurrence formulae with respect to time: only two sequential temporal levels are required for computations. Instead of conditions on top and bottom boundaries of the domain we use a larger domain where a deformed wave equation is considered. All the formulae have the second order accuracy with respect to both time and space. Test calculations show that proposed conditions do provide a high accuracy without noticeable computational costs.
