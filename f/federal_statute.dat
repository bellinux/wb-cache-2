5|$|In 2007, the Court {{upheld a}} <b>federal</b> <b>statute</b> banning partial-birth {{abortion}} in Gonzales v. Carhart. University of Chicago law professor Geoffrey R. Stone, a former colleague of Scalia's, criticized Gonzales, stating that religion had influenced the outcome because all five justices {{in the majority}} were Catholic, whereas the dissenters were Protestant or Jewish. This angered Scalia {{to such an extent}} that he stated he would not speak at the University of Chicago as long as Stone was there.|$|E
40|$|Scholars {{have long}} debated the {{separation}} of powers question of what judicial power federal courts have under Article III of the Constitution in the enterprise of interpreting <b>federal</b> <b>statutes.</b> Specifically, scholars have debated whether, in light of Founding-era English and state court judicial practice, the judicial power of the United States should be understood as a power to interpret statutes dynamically or as faithful agents of Congress. This Article argues that the question of how courts should interpret <b>federal</b> <b>statutes</b> is one not only of separation of powers but of federalism as well. State courts have a vital and often independent role in the American constitutional structure in interpreting <b>federal</b> <b>statutes.</b> In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, state courts, though they interpreted state statutes equitably in certain cases, interpreted <b>federal</b> <b>statutes</b> only in ways designed to implement, as far as possible, the directives of Congress. This Article describes the practice of state courts in interpreting <b>federal</b> <b>statutes</b> during the first few decades after ratification, explains why state judges may have felt constrained not to interpret <b>federal</b> <b>statutes</b> equitably, and suggests possible implications of this analysis for the question of how federal courts should interpret <b>federal</b> <b>statutes.</b> statutory interpretation, federalism, separation of powers, federal courts, state courts, supremacy claus...|$|R

50|$|Article 190 of the Swiss Federal Constitution {{states that}} <b>federal</b> <b>statutes</b> and {{international}} law are binding on the Swiss Federal Supreme Court. In consequence, the courts are not empowered to review the constitutionality of <b>federal</b> <b>statutes,</b> but will, where possible, construe statutes {{so as not to}} create a conflict with the Constitution. The courts can suspend the application of <b>federal</b> <b>statutes</b> that conflict with international law, but tend to exercise this power cautiously and deferentially: In Schubert (BGE 99 Ib 39), the Federal Supreme Court refused to do so because Parliament had consciously violated international law in drafting the statute at issue.|$|R
5|$|Passage of the {{national}} Civil Rights Act of 1964 had {{paved the way for}} an even stronger civil rights bill in the 1966 legislative session. The Assembly easily passed the Kentucky Civil Rights Act opening all public accommodations to people of every race and prohibiting racial discrimination in employment by firms that employed eight or more people. The act applied to many kinds of businesses not covered by the <b>federal</b> <b>statute,</b> and approximately ninety percent of the businesses in Kentucky were affected, compared to only sixty percent that were covered by the <b>federal</b> <b>statute.</b> The act was {{the first of its kind}} passed in a southern state. In 1966, Breathitt was presented with the Lincoln Key Award for his leadership in the bill's passage. In 1966 and 1967, he was chair of the Southern Governors' Conference's Committee on Regional and Interstate Cooperation. He was also the only state governor named to the President's Council on Human Rights.|$|E
5|$|The Burger King v. Hoots {{trademark}} {{dispute and}} its resulting decision {{went beyond the}} original case, it established a major legal precedent in the United States {{in regards to the}} Lanham Act. The ruling states that while the senior user of the state service mark or trademark has prior usage of the common law marks, <b>federal</b> <b>statute</b> overrides the earlier, state service mark and prohibits the senior user from preventing the junior user from exercising the use of the federally registered mark outside a defined geographic reach of the senior user.|$|E
5|$|The next {{important}} case came in 1935 {{when the}} state's top court ruled in State v. De Jonge, 152 Or. 315, 51 P.2d 674 (1935) that the 14th Amendment did not protect Communist Party organizers from prosecution under Oregonâ€™s criminal syndicate law. However, the U.S. Supreme Court would overturn this decision in DeJonge v. Oregon, 299 U.S. 353 (1937). Another important case came in 1960 as the Oregon court ruled against the United States government in State Land Board v. United States, 222 Or. 40, 352 P.2d 539 (1960). In that case {{the court ruled}} that state estate laws trumped a <b>federal</b> <b>statute</b> concerning the property of U.S. Veterans who died at Veterans Administration hospitals without a valid will. The U.S. Supreme Court then overturned the Oregon Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Oregon, 366 U. S. 643 (1961).|$|E
