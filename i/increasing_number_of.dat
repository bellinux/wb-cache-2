5|$|After the Second World War the {{historical}} analysis of British castles {{was dominated by}} Arnold Taylor, R. Allen Brown and D. J. Cathcart King. These academics made use of a growing amount of archaeological evidence, as the 1940s saw an <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> excavations of motte and bailey castles, {{and the number of}} castle excavations as a whole went on to double during the 1960s. With an <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> castle sites under threat in urban areas, a public scandal in 1972 surrounding the development of the Baynard's Castle site in London contributed to reforms and a re-prioritisation of funding for rescue archaeology. Despite this the number of castle excavations fell between 1974 and 1984, with the archaeological work focusing on conducting excavations on a greater number of small-scale, but fewer large-scale sites. The study of British castles remained primarily focused on analysing their military role, however, drawing on the evolutionary model of improvements suggested by Thompson earlier in the century.|$|E

5|$|Historian Nancy Bristow {{has argued}} that the pandemic, when {{combined}} with the <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing.

Nursing staff, who were predominantly women, felt more inclined to celebrate the success of their patient care and less inclined to identify the spread of the disease with their own work.|$|E
