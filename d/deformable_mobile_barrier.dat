This procedure offers a better representation of the current accident situation and, in particular, the barrier concept is a better reflection of front-end stiffness seen in today’s passenger car fleet compared to that of the current legislative barrier face. Based on the preliminary performance corridors of the prototype AE-MDB, a refined AE-MDB specification has been developed. A programme of barrier to load cell wall testing was undertaken to complete and standardise the AE-MDB specification. Barrier faces were supplied by the four leading manufacturers to demonstrate that the specification could be met by all. This paper includes background, specification and proof of compliance...|$|R
40|$|In {{the next}} 20 years {{the share of}} small {{electric}} vehicles (SEVs) will increase especially in urban areas. SEVs show distinctive design differences compared to traditional vehicles. Thus the consequences of impacts of SEVs with vulnerable road users (VRUs) and other vehicles will be different from traditional collisions. No assessment concerning vehicle safety is defined for vehicles within European L 7 e category currently. Focus of the elaborated methodology is to define appropriate test scenarios for this vehicle category to be used within a virtual tool chain. A virtual tool chain has to be defined for the realization of a guideline of virtual certification. The derivation and development of new test conditions for SEVs are described and are {{the main focus of}} this work. As key methodology a prospective methodical analysis under consideration of future aspects like pre-crash safety systems is applied. The studies show that certain collision types will be reduced in numbers and in average collision severity. Based on the evaluation following tests are proposed. Frontal: oblique (30 °), test speed 35 km/h, 1, 300 kg <b>Mobile</b> Progressive <b>Deformable</b> <b>Barrier</b> (MPDB); Side: 90 °, Advanced European <b>Mobile</b> <b>Deformable</b> <b>Barrier</b> (AE-MDB), barrier speed 40 km/h; Pedestrian safety: seven pedestrian impact locations, 2 speed ranges, four different percentiles. The proposed virtual testing procedure has to be based on well validated models and tools, which can be assumed to be available in the future. The focus of the presented work is on SEVs in L 7 e category, for which no specific, urban area relevant safety regulations are available. Overall occupant and VRU safety of future SEVs will increase significantly, if additionally to the standard crash tests the elaborated tests from the European Union (EU) initiative SafeEV are applied for the design of safety measures within L 7 e vehicle class...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper studies <b>mobile</b> <b>barrier</b> {{coverage}} (MBC) surrounding dynamic objects. In {{the real}} world, several dynamic objects {{can benefit from}} MBC. For example, marching troop can detect any adversary intrusion without blind spot by MBC. However, conventional works only focused on barrier coverage for static objects, which fail when the objects start to move. Issues to address these dynamic-object scenarios, we propose the problem of <b>mobile</b> <b>barrier</b> coverage for dynamic objects. The most challenge is how to effectively maintain MBC when the motion of objects are unpredictable. We propose a fully distributed algorithm for mobile sensor nodes to cooperatively move and maintain the high-quality barrier coverage. The extensive simulations based on large-scale trace data demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of structural interaction {{has been identified}} as the main challenge of the unresolved problem of frontal crash compatibility. With this background, two questions are raised: Does a better structural interaction correspond with higher safety and crash compatibility? Are current test approaches able to evaluate structural properties? Considering the structural mechanics of collisions, it is hypothesized that a poor structural interaction does not necessarily result in lower safety and should be considered together with compartment strength and restraint systems. This hypothesis is confirmed by reviewing some crash results from other studies. A spring-mass vehicle model is also used to verify the hypothesis. Finally, a comprehensive simulation study is conducted to find the answers to the two questions. For this study three different variations of a vehicle model are created, which represent different structural properties of the passenger car fleet. The crash performance of these models is analyzed in different car-to-car and car-to-barrier tests. Results of the car-to-car tests show that better structural interaction often makes the vehicle more aggressive. Generally, better structural interaction increases crash pulse and reduces intrusions. Depending on vehicle design and crash configuration, the intrusions or the crash pulse become more important as to why good or poor structural interaction cannot be overall related to more crash compatibility or occupant safety. Our criticism of the current assessment approaches for frontal crash compatibility is the establishment of a direct link between good structural interaction and higher safety. These approaches do not consider the effect of higher crash pulses due to the better structural interaction. Our recommendation is to assess the partner protection through metrics about intrusions and crash pulse of the partner, without direct {{assessment of}} the structural interaction. Instead, the test configuration should be able to reflect structural properties in intrusions or crash pulse. Results of the car-to-barrier tests show that the Progressive Deformable Barrier can reflect structural issues correctly. However, the developed metrics for this barrier result in incomprehensive interpretations. Results of the tests with other barriers are inconsistent with the structural properties of the vehicles. Finally, an exemplary test concept with the Advanced European <b>Mobile</b> <b>Deformable</b> <b>Barrier</b> is presented as an alternative assessment approach. Simulation results of the proposed assessment approach show good consistency with the crash performance of the vehicles in the car-to-car tests. Combination of this test concept with the Full-Width Rigid Barrier test can be used to assess the safety and crash compatibility of passenger cars...|$|R

40|$|Dummy {{responses}} {{in a crash}} test can vary depending {{not only on the}} change of velocity but also on how the impact was generated. Literature reporting how acceleration pulses can vary in cars impacted in different configurations is limited. The aim {{of this study was to}} collect and categorise different acceleration pulses in 3 different types of rear collision. The acceleration pulse resulting from a solid, 1000 kg, <b>mobile</b> <b>barrier</b> test at 40 % overlap and an impact velocity of 15 km/h was studied for 33 different cars. Seven cars were impacted at 100 % overlap at higher impact velocities using the same <b>mobile</b> <b>barrier.</b> Acceleration pulses from two different car types in real-world collisions producing a similar change of velocity were also analysed. The results from the barrier tests show that a similar change of velocity can be generated by a large variety of pulse shapes in low velocity rear impacts. The results from real-world collisions showed that a similar change of velocity was generated in different ways both in terms of peak and mean acceleration. The results of this study highlight the importance of knowing the acceleration pulse both when evaluating the severity of a real world crash and when designing test methods for evaluating vehicle safety performance in low velocity rear-end impacts, particularly in respect of soft tissue neck injuries...|$|R

40|$|The Venice lagoon {{identifies}} {{a complex}} natural system hosting {{a number of}} economic activities. Due to its hydro-geological conformation, it is consistently threatened by climate change. In particular, it is strongly threatened by global worming and average sea level rise inducing a higher frequency and intensity of the acqua alta phenomenon (i. e. the periodical flooding of the city centre due to particular astronomical and meteorological conditions). In order to protect Venice from the damages induced by the more and more frequent flooding episodes, various mitigation and prevention measures have been adopted, among which the <b>mobile</b> <b>barriers</b> system (MOSE) at the inlets. The adoption of such a protection measure limits the damages caused to Venetians and to the economic activities carried out within the lagoon (trade, tourism, public services, ¿). Nevertheless, it could interfere with port traffic, one of the still currently most relevant economic activities of Venice: the <b>mobile</b> <b>barriers</b> procedure of closing isolates the lagoon from the open Adriatic Sea and then interrupts the in and outflow of ships. Longer waiting time for ships entering or exiting from the lagoon could therefore induce additional costs, in terms for example of the charter costs and, for ships blocked within the lagoon from the <b>mobile</b> <b>barriers</b> closure, even mooring costs. As a consequence, {{the analysis of the}} potentially negative effects of MOSE functioning on port activities represent a relevant component of the analysis of the 'acqua alta' impacts on the Venice lagoon. Moving from this background, the present paper is aimed to estimate the costs induced by the interruption of ships' flow due to MOSE functioning through an hydrodynamic model applied to the port traffic experienced during the period 2000 - 2002. A partial analysis is proposed taking into account only the estimated costs for port users (direct costs) and not even the costs deriving from the eventual reduction of ships' flow (indirect costs). Nevertheless, the present paper contributes to the analysis of the effects of MOSE functioning on Venice port activities by integrating, even if through different methodologies, the study proposed by Nunes et al. (2005) on the benefits of MOSE functioning on the commercial activities carried out within the city centre and by enlarging the paper of Chiabai and Nunes (2008) on the negative effects on port activities. Our results show that the negative effects are limited. The present paper is structured as follows: Section 1 briefly describes the 'acqua alta' phenomenon and its evolution over the last century. Section 2 introduces the MOSE and its procedure of functioning. Section 3 discusses the effects of MOSE functioning on the Venetian port activities, considering the evolution of ship traffic since the Second World War. Section 4 provides an hydrodynamic analysis of MOSE interferences with the Venetian port traffic experienced during the period 2000 - 2002.

An exploratory experiment was designed to study the role of form in DUI design. The purpose is to find insights from people’s instinct and tactile sense and to study dimensional properties on flexible materials.

25|$|Seiches {{have been}} {{observed}} in seas such as the Adriatic Sea and the Baltic Sea. This results in the flooding of Venice and St. Petersburg, respectively, as both cities are constructed on former marshland. In St. Petersburg, seiche-induced flooding is common along the Neva River in the autumn. The seiche is driven by a low pressure region in the North Atlantic moving onshore, giving rise to cyclonic lows on the Baltic Sea. The low pressure of the cyclone draws greater-than-normal quantities of water into the virtually land-locked Baltic. As the cyclone continues inland, long, low-frequency seiche waves with wavelengths up to several hundred kilometres are established in the Baltic. When the waves reach the narrow and shallow Neva Bay, they become much higher — ultimately flooding the Neva embankments. Similar phenomena are observed at Venice, resulting in the MOSE Project, a system of 79 <b>mobile</b> <b>barriers</b> {{designed to protect the}} three entrances to the Venetian Lagoon.|$|R
