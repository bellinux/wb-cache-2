5|$|Capybaras are {{hunted for}} their meat and pelts in some areas, and {{otherwise}} killed by <b>humans</b> <b>who</b> see their grazing as competition for livestock. In some areas, they are farmed, {{which has the}} effect of ensuring the wetland habitats are protected. Their survival is aided by their ability to breed rapidly.|$|E

5|$|Viruses {{reproduce}} rapidly {{because they}} {{have only a few}} genes compared to <b>humans</b> <b>who</b> have 20,000–25,000. For example, influenza virus has only eight genes and rotavirus has eleven. These genes encode structural proteins that form the virus particle, or non-structural proteins, that are only found in cells infected by the virus.|$|E
5|$|A few species, the Caribbean fire sponge Tedania ignis, cause {{a severe}} rash in <b>humans</b> <b>who</b> handle them. Turtles and some fish feed mainly on sponges. It {{is often said}} that sponges produce {{chemical}} defenses against such predators. However an experiment showed {{that there is no}} relationship between the toxicity of chemicals produced by sponges and how they taste to fish, which would diminish the usefulness of chemical defenses as deterrents. Predation by fish may even help to spread sponges by detaching fragments.|$|E

5|$|A {{second case}} occurs {{a few days}} later, another man killed by the beetles, but they find the beetles to be larger and more mature. From the second victim's movements, they {{identify}} the likely culprit as Dr. Armand Silva (Alon Abutbul), a former scientist. Dr. Silva {{was working on a}} cure for avian flu using the skelter beetle, but his research was terminated with the extinction of the sheep. Fauxlivia and Frank postulate Dr. Silva may be trying to breed the beetles in <b>humans,</b> <b>who</b> share similar biological features with sheep.|$|E
5|$|Dragon's Egg is a 1980 {{hard science}} fiction novel by Robert L. Forward. In the story, Dragon's Egg is {{a neutron star}} with a surface gravity 67billion times that of Earth, and {{inhabited}} by cheela, intelligent creatures {{the size of a}} sesame seed who live, think and develop a million times faster than humans. Most of the novel, from May to June 2050, chronicles the cheela civilization beginning with its discovery of agriculture to advanced technology and its first face-to-face contact with <b>humans,</b> <b>who</b> are observing the hyper-rapid evolution of the cheela civilization from orbit around Dragon's Egg.|$|E
5|$|In a four-part series {{published}} between August and November 1994, Brock teams up {{with the}} anti-hero Vengeance to fight the Stalkers, a group of alien-technology-enhanced <b>humans</b> <b>who</b> have kidnapped Beck (and others) with Venom's protection. This series also introduces another romantic interest for Brock (Elizabeth, a doctor) in addition to Beck. It also begins a plot thread in which Brock is informed {{that there are other}} symbiotic hosts like himself.|$|E

5|$|Laevistrombus {{canarium}} {{lives on}} muddy and sandy bottoms, grazing on algae and detritus. It is gonochoristic and sexually dimorphic, depending on internal fertilization for spawning. Larvae {{of this species}} spend several days as plankton, undergoing a series of transformations until they reach complete metamorphosis. The maximum life span is 2 to 2.5 years. Predators of this snail include carnivorous gastropods such as cone snails and volutes. It is also a prey species for vertebrates including macaques, and also <b>humans,</b> <b>who</b> consume the soft parts {{in a wide variety}} of dishes.|$|E
5|$|ProtoGalaxy is {{presented}} from a 2.5D perspective; the 2D playing field employs 3D graphics. ProtoGalaxy incorporates {{elements of a}} variety of gaming genres, such as adventure, arcade, shooter, puzzle, and role-playing genres. In the game's back-story, a species of powerful, unknown extraterrestrials enters the Milky Way with the intention of enslaving its inhabitants. The player characters, of which there may be up to four at a time, follow a storyline by which they must defend Earth from an alien threat and restore human civilization, rebuilding for the sake of those <b>humans</b> <b>who</b> survive.|$|E
5|$|Study of the H. pylori genome is {{centered}} on attempts to understand pathogenesis, the ability of this organism to cause disease. About 29% of the loci have acolonization defectwhen mutated. Two of sequenced strains have an around 40-kb-long Cag pathogenicity island (a common gene sequence believed responsible for pathogenesis) that contains over 40 genes. This pathogenicity island is usually absent from H. pylori strains isolated from <b>humans</b> <b>who</b> are carriers of H. pylori but remain asymptomatic.|$|E

5|$|The ancient trade city of Phlan {{has fallen}} into impoverished ruin. Now {{only a small}} portion of the city remains {{inhabited}} by <b>humans,</b> <b>who</b> are surrounded by evil creatures. To rebuild the city and clean up the Barren River, the city council of New Phlan has decided to recruit adventurers to drive the monsters from the neighboring ruins. Using bards and publications, they spread tales of the riches waiting to be recovered in Phlan, which draws the player's party to these shores by ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{birds were}} hunted by {{settlers}} on Réunion, who also kept them as cagebirds. Nineteen specimens exist in museums around the world. The hoopoe starling {{was reported to}} be in decline by the early 19th century, and was probably extinct before the 1860s. A number of factors have been proposed, including competition and predation by introduced species, disease, deforestation and persecution by <b>humans,</b> <b>who</b> hunted it for food and as an alleged crop pest.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{opens with}} three rangers of the Night's Watch – Ser Waymar Royce, Will and Gared – {{scouting}} beyond the Wall, a massive barrier of ice {{at the north}} end of the kingdom. After finding the mutilated corpses of some wildlings (tribal <b>humans</b> <b>who</b> live north of the Wall), the rangers are confronted by White Walkers (demonic creatures) and undead wildlings. Two of the rangers are killed by the White Walkers, while the third, Will, is for some reason left alive. Fearing for his life, Will deserts the Night's Watch, going South, without returning to the Wall.|$|E
5|$|When {{they live}} in {{polluted}} waters, bivalve molluscs {{have a tendency to}} accumulate substances such as heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants in their tissues. This is because they ingest the chemicals as they feed but their enzyme systems are not capable of metabolising them and as a result, the levels build up. This may be a health hazard for the molluscs themselves, and is one for <b>humans</b> <b>who</b> eat them. It also has certain advantages in that bivalves can be used in monitoring the presence and quantity of pollutants in their environment.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} philosophers, {{including}} Elizabeth Anscombe , Jean Bethke Elshtain , Servais Pinckaers, Iris Murdoch, and the Catholic Encyclopedia, have all {{suggested that the}} Kantian conception of ethics rooted in autonomy is contradictory in its dual contention that humans are co-legislators of morality and that morality is a priori. They argue that if something is universally a priori (i.e., existing unchangingly prior to experience), then it cannot also be in part dependent upon <b>humans,</b> <b>who</b> have not always existed. On the other hand, if humans truly do legislate morality, then they are not bound by it objectively, because they are always free to change it.|$|E
