For the fourth method, the parts were {{cooked in water}} followed by dusting, battering, breading, and short, <b>deep</b> <b>fat</b> <b>frying</b> (WC). Industrial pilot plant equipment was used. Pickup of batter and breading and yields for the separate parts at each step were determined. Evaluation of frozen, reheated parts included taste paneling and determination of shear values. Moisture and fat analyses were performed on samples after the first cooking. Final average yield (final weight/raw weight) for combined parts was highest for pieces cooked by FSF, followed by FOC in both experiments. Sensory scores for texture, tenderness, juiciness, flavor, and overall acceptability of meat were generally optimum for parts cooked by all methods.

40|$|<b>Deep</b> <b>frying</b> in oil {{has become}} one of the most favoured {{procedures}} for the culinary preparation as the process is easy, rapid, relatively energy sav-ing, and the resulting meal has an agreeable and intensive flavour. The main disadvantage of <b>deep</b> <b>frying</b> is the rapid degradation of frying oil at high temperatures. As the oxidation products are objectionable from both sensory and food safety aspects, the oil used has to be replaced by fresh oil from time to time which is rather expensive. The use of antioxidants or special frying equipment is only a partial solution. Therefore, the use of more stable frying oils would be desirable. Traditional frying oils Traditional frying medium in Central Europe was pork lard, but it is rather expensive and rich in saturated fatty acids and cholesterol. High price is objectionable in the case of olive oil. Refined edible oils prepared from oilseeds are the main edible oils now such as soybean, rapeseed, sunflower, or peanut oils (E������ � 1996) which have high contents of polyenoic fatty acids, mainly linoleic and sometimes also linolenic acids. They may be used for pan frying in which frying oil is used only once and is immediately consumed. However, they are not suitable for <b>deep</b> <b>fat</b> <b>frying</b> where frying oil is used many times, as they are easily oxidised at high frying temperatures. Palm kernel or coconut oils are more stable but their saturated fatty acid content is very high. Hydrogenated vegetable oils were used almost exclusively until recently for <b>deep</b> <b>fat</b> <b>frying</b> (E������ � 1996).

40|$|Introduction: The {{consumption}} of fried and prefried foods {{has been linked}} {{with an increase in}} the intake of fats and oils subjected to high temperatures. The oils and fats are usually processed to improve the quality, stability and safety. Despite removing a large amount of impurities from the oil, the processing can often originate the formation of contaminants that can cause additional health hazards to those who consume these foods. Methods: An extensive bibliographic review with respect to sample preparation, chromatographic methods, and contents of trans fatty acids (TFA), 3 -monochloropropane- 1, 2 -diol (3 -MCPD) and 4 -hydroxy- 2 -trans-nonenal (HNE) in oils/fats subjected to <b>deep</b> <b>fat</b> <b>frying,</b> has been carried out. Results and Discussion: Some of the chemical reactions that are involved in the frying oils degradation are: hydrolysis, oxidation, isomerisation and polymerisation. These chemical reactions can result in the production of free fatty acids, aldehydes, ketones, diglycerides and monoglycerides, and trans isomers. Over the years, several studies have been conducted in many countries to determine the levels of TFA in foods. Refined oils have low TFA levels (1. 0 - 1. 5 %), but the neutralisation, especially in the preparation of fried foods, can make significant contribution to the daily intake of TFA. Foods that contain partially hydrogenated fats contribute about 80 % to 90 % of the daily intake of TFA. 3 -MCPD is a contaminant resulting from food processing that belongs to the group of chloropropanols. Recently, the occurrence of high levels of 3 -MCPD (150 - 10000 µg/kg) in edible oils has been reported. HNE is a cytotoxic and mutagenic secondary lipid peroxidation product of linoleic acid and arachidonic acid which formation is enhanced in <b>deep</b> <b>fat</b> <b>frying.</b> Best approaches to guarantee both quality and safety of fats and oils subjected to <b>deep</b> <b>fat</b> <b>frying</b> are discussed and evaluated.
