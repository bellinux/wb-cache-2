40|$|Based on the {{analysis}} of notch-root stresses and strains in bodies subjected to multiaxial loading, a quantitative relationship between Neuber rule and the <b>equivalent</b> strain <b>energy</b> density method is found. In the case of elastic range, both Neuber rule and the <b>equivalent</b> strain <b>energy</b> density method get the same estimation of the local stresses and strains. Whereas {{in the case of}} elastic-plastic range, Neuber rule generally overestimates the notch-root stresses and strains and the <b>equivalent</b> strain <b>energy</b> density method tends to underestimate the notch-root stresses and strains. A modified method is presented considering the material constants of elastic-plastic Poisson's ratio, elastic modulus, shear elastic modulus, and yield stress. The essence of the modified model is to add a modified coefficient to Neuber rule, which makes the calculated results tend to be more precise and reveals its energy meaning. This approach considers the elastic-plastic properties of the material itself and avoids the blindness of selecting coefficient values. Finally the calculation results using the modified model are validated with the experimental data...|$|R

Measured TPA cross-sections of rhodamine dyes are consistently higher in nonpolar solvents. Certain complementary and similarity between TPA and TPF are also elucidated.

40|$|A {{review of}} {{planning}} studies was undertaken to evaluate estimated risks of radiation induced second primary cancers (RISPC) associated with different prostate radiotherapy techniques for localised prostate cancer. A total of 83 publications were identified which employed {{a variety of}} methods to estimate RISPC risk. Of these, the 16 planning studies which specifically addressed absolute or relative second cancer risk using dose–response models were selected for inclusion within this review. There are uncertainties and limitations related to all the different methods for estimating RISPC risk. Whether or not dose models include the effects of the primary radiation beam, as well as out-of-field regions, influences estimated risks. Regarding the impact of IMRT compared to 3 D-CRT, at <b>equivalent</b> <b>energies,</b> several studies suggest an increase in risk related to increased leakage contributing to out-of-field RISPC risk, although in absolute terms this increase in risk may be very small. IMRT also results in increased low dose normal tissue irradiation, but the extent to which this has been estimated to contribute to RISPC risk is variable, and may also be very small. IMRT is often delivered using 6 MV photons while conventional radiotherapy often requires higher energies to achieve adequate tissue penetration, and so comparisons between IMRT and older techniques should not be restricted to <b>equivalent</b> <b>energies.</b> Proton and brachytherapy planning studies suggest very low RISPC risks associated with these techniques. Until there is sufficient clinical evidence regarding RISPC risks associated with modern irradiation techniques, the data produced from planning studies is relevant when considering which patients to irradiate, and which technique to employ...|$|R
