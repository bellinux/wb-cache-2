I pride myself in the fact that, when you pick up an issue of the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|E

Mignola elaborated, [...] "The <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stories</b> I wanted to do I had in mind before I created Hellboy. It’s not like I created Hellboy and said, 'Hey, now what does this guy do?'

His opponents in these matches {{included}} many illustrious names, such as Hashimoto Utaro, Sakata Eio, Takagawa Shukaku, and the ex-Honinbo Iwamoto Kaoru. Go Seigen was also matched against Kubouchi Shuchi, a player from the Kansai Ki-in {{who had a}} strong individual style. In these matches, Go Seigen demonstrated an equal dominance over his rivals. He had an excellent record against Takagawa, whose main achievement was winning the Honinbo title for nine consecutive years. In the period between 1951 and 1960, Go won 22 of their games, and Takagawa won 13. By 1960, Sakata had emerged as Go Seigen's most serious rival, but {{the results of their}} games between 1950 and 1960 told the same <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>story.</b> Go had 14 wins to Sakata's 9 and one jigo, or draw.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{previous}} two shows in the continuity, Models Inc. did not experience any significant changes in character focus or tone. Instead, the writers chose to explore the ensemble cast from the start and immediately present the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>story</b> lines that had made Melrose Place famous. The initial focus of the series was a mystery surrounding the murder of model Teri Spencer (Stephanie Romanov), who'd announced her intentions to leave the agency. For a number of episodes throughout the first story arc, suspects included Hillary, Teri's ex-boyfriend Brian (Cameron Daddo), Teri's rival Julie (Kylie Travis), and Teri's own sister Carrie (Carrie-Anne Moss). Once the killer was revealed, the characters moved on, with their focus switching {{to the arrival of}} Stephanie Romanov's new character Monique, a model who was a nearly dead ringer for Teri. The remainder of the series largely centered around the models' growing relationships with their boyfriends and each other, while also dealing with the issues of substance abuse and the pressures of the business. Primary antagonists included several figures from the models' pasts—including a stalker, a jealous sister, and Grayson (Emma Samms), the cunning and powerful ex-wife of Monique's fiance.|$|E
500|$|The film is loosely {{inspired}} {{by the work of}} Raymond Chandler. Joel Coen stated: [...] "We wanted to do a Chandler <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>story</b> – how it moves episodically, and deals with the characters trying to unravel a mystery, as well as having a hopelessly complex plot that's ultimately unimportant." [...] The original score was composed by Carter Burwell, a longtime collaborator of the Coen brothers.|$|E

500|$|The fall of Communism in Russia is {{the main}} focus of the opening titles, {{designed}} by Daniel Kleinman (who took over from Maurice Binder after his death in 1991).

In an interview, Kleinman said they were meant to be [...] "a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>story</b> telling sequence" [...] showing that [...] "what was happening in Communist countries was Communism was falling down". According to producer Michael G.

Natasha Walter from The Guardian wrote, [...] "Hosseini is skilled at telling a certain <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>story,</b> in which events that may seem unbearable - violence, misery and abuse - are made readable.

He previewed songs {{at different stages of}} completion to get feedback from guest artists, some of whom he cited as his [...] "creative heroes", including record producer Pharrell, who co-wrote and co-produced [...] "Sweet Life" [...] with Ocean. Ocean and Malay previewed songs to rock musician John Mayer, which inspired his guitar playing for both [...] "Pyramids" [...] and [...] "White". For the latter track, they used the instrumental of the song of the same name from Odd Future's 2012 album The OF Tape Vol. 2, recorded atmospheric instrumentation by Mayer and other musicians, and tracked it to the original instrumental. Ocean reached out to rappers André 3000 and Big Boi of hip hop duo Outkast to appear on [...] "Pink Matter". However, André 3000 did not want to reunite with Big Boi as a duo on another artist's album. The former ended up rapping alone and playing guitar on the song.

500|$|Merwin's successor, Mines, also {{published}} some excellent work, though increased {{competition in the}} early 1950s from Galaxy and The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction did lead to some dilution of quality, and Startlings rates—one to two cents per word—could not compete with the leading magazines. [...] However, Startlings editorial policy was more eclectic: it did not limit itself to one <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>story,</b> but printed everything from melodramatic space opera to sociological sf, and Mines {{had a reputation as}} having [...] "the most catholic tastes and the fewest inhibitions" [...] of any of the science fiction magazine editors. [...] In late 1952, Mines published Philip José Farmer's [...] "The Lovers", a taboo-breaking story about aliens who can reproduce only by mating with humans. [...] Illustrated with an eye-popping cover by Bergey, Farmer's ground-breaking story integrated sex into the plot without being prurient, and was widely praised. Farmer, partly as a consequence, went on to win a Hugo Award as [...] "Most Promising New Writer". [...] New authors first published by Mines include Frank Herbert, who debuted with [...] "Looking for Something?" [...] in April 1952, and Robert F. Young, whose first story, [...] "The Black Deep Thou Wingest", appeared in June 1953.

500|$|He {{became a}} science fiction fan in 1941, {{attracted}} particularly by the works of E. E. [...] "Doc" [...] Smith, which featured good aliens as well as evil ones, and of Robert A. Heinlein, many of whose stories concern ordinary people. In 1947 he met another Irish fan, Walter A. ("Walt") Willis, and the two helped to produce the fan magazines Slant (1948–1953) and Hyphen (1952–1965), which featured stories and articles by noted authors including John Brunner, A. Bertram Chandler, and Bob Shaw. In 2004 both White and Willis were nominated for the retrospective Hugo Award for Best Fan Writer of 1953, although neither won. White said that he started writing stories because the Slant team felt that Astounding Science Fiction was too dominated by prophesies of nuclear doom, and his friends dared him to write the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>story</b> that they all liked to read. He said that getting published was fairly easy during the 1950s, as the World War II restrictions on paper were ended, and {{there were at least}} 12science magazines in Britain and about 40 in the United States. His first published short story, [...] "Assisted Passage", a parody of 1950s Anglo-Australian emigration policies, appeared in the January 1953 edition of the magazine New Worlds. Further stories appeared in New Worlds during the next few years, but White's attempt to access the more lucrative American market by submitting stories to Astounding Science Fiction stalled after the publication of [...] "The Scavengers". White later said that his optimism about inter-species relations was unpalatable to Astoundings xenophobic editor, John W. Campbell. As a result, White's work was little-known outside the UK until the 1960s.|$|E

Viggo Mortensen was considered for the role. Snyder stated, [...] "Zod is not only one of Superman's most formidable enemies, {{but one of the}} most significant because he has insights into Superman that others don't. Michael is a powerful actor who can project both the intelligence and the malice of the character, making him perfect for the role." [...] When Goyer was asked about why Zod was chosen as the villain, he stated, [...] "The way (Christopher) Nolan and I have always approached movies as well is you never say, 'Hey, which villain would be cool for this movie?' You start with the story first. What <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>story?</b> What kind of theme do you want to tell? So we worked that out. Then, usually the villain becomes obvious in terms of who's going to be the appropriate antagonist for that. When you guys see the movie, the only villain we could've used was Zod and the Kryptonians. I mean, when you see what the whole story is, nothing else would have even made sense." [...] Shannon also commented on his portrayal in comparison to Terence Stamp's original take on Zod, [...] "To follow Terence Stamp's iconic performance in the original, it is daunting, but I just focused on one day at a time. It's interesting that when we started with this, we did a lot of training together and I think that kind of helped loosen things up a little bit. It is a very physical movie at the end of the day.

Therefore, this study focuses on in-depth stories that originated inside the newsroom.
