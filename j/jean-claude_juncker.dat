David Cameron is increasingly dialling up his rhetoric in response to <b>Jean-Claude</b> <b>Juncker’s</b> candidacy for head of the European Commission, with Juncker’s reported advocacy for a “United States of Europe” driving right-wing euroscepticism to a new pitch – unsurprising after a European parliament election that saw a broad surge in anti-EU voting...|$|R

40|$|The UK’s {{nominated}} Commissioner, Jonathan Hill, {{was assigned}} {{the financial services}} portfolio in <b>Jean-Claude</b> <b>Juncker’s</b> proposed European Commission. As this {{was viewed as a}} positive outcome for British interests, some commentators have suggested the threat of a ‘Brexit’ may have factored into the decision. Simon Usherwood writes that while a Brexit might not have been foremost in Juncker’s mind, it nevertheless played a role. He argues however that the UK should not expect preferential treatment and that the country’s relationship with the EU remains far from resolved...|$|R
40|$|What lessons {{have been}} drawn by the EU from the CETA and TTIP trade negotiations? Johan Adriaensen argues that the trade package {{contained}} in <b>Jean-Claude</b> <b>Juncker's</b> State of the Union speech presented a coherent vision for how EU trade negotiations could move forward, with avenues for discontent at future agreements to be channelled through representative institutions. However, implementing these ideas will be far from straightforward, and {{it is unclear whether}} the EU will be able to prevent the kind of opposition to future trade agreements that it experienced in both the CETA and TTIP cases...|$|R
25|$|Due to {{the victory}} of the European People's Party in the {{previous}} election, EPP parties were keen to get one of their members into the post, including Luxembourgian Prime Minister <b>Jean-Claude</b> <b>Juncker</b> (EPP), who refused, and Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schüssel (EPP), who was in a coalition with the far-right Freedom Party of Austria which discredited him as a candidate to some governments.|$|E
25|$|EC & EEAS: Signalling reassertion by France over European {{diplomacy}} and security matters, the President of the European Commission <b>Jean-Claude</b> <b>Juncker</b> appointed Michel Barnier, the former EU Internal Market Commissioner, as his special advisor on defence and security.

He notes that with even Alexis Tsipras, the leader of the left-wing SYRIZA party in Greece and Commission President candidate for the Party of the European Left, appearing to support Juncker, the UK is in danger of appearing to be the main obstacle to bringing the EU closer to its citizens...|$|R
50|$|In July 2014, {{given the}} large number of Italian MEPs {{belonging}} to the S&D group following the 2014 European election, the European Council considered her as a candidate for the position of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, in <b>Jean-Claude</b> <b>Juncker's</b> new European Commission. On 13 July 2014, the Financial Times among other European newspapers reported that her nomination proposal had been opposed by the Baltic states and several Central-European countries, including Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania and Poland, where her stance towards Russia concerning the Ukrainian crisis was considered to be too soft.|$|R
25|$|The Juncker Commission is the European Commission {{in office}} since 1 November 2014 and {{is due to}} serve until 2019. Its {{president}} is <b>Jean-Claude</b> <b>Juncker,</b> who presides over 27 other commissioners (one {{from each of the}} states composing the European Union, except Luxembourg, which is Juncker's state). In July 2014, Juncker was officially elected to succeed José Manuel Barroso, who completed his second five-year term in that year.|$|E

25|$|Although he was {{a member}} of the European Parliament, Farage campaigned to leave the EU as a key figurehead for the British exit from the EU in 2016.

This essay outlines the main structural and thematic changes introduced by the new Commission, in particular those with direct or indirect relevance to EU JHA or the Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ) policies. It also reflects on the new institutional configuration {{and what it means}} for the substantive work of the new Commission services and for their intra- and inter-institutional relations.

40|$|Gender balance {{has been}} a {{particularly}} salient issue in the recent process of formulating the list of designated commissioners. <b>Jean-Claude</b> <b>Juncker’s</b> success, as President-elect of the European Commission, in securing the designation of nine women as commissioners should be seen in perspective. Female representation in top EU positions remains low. This paper analyses the EP committees, finding a clear divergence in legislative influence between committees chaired by men and women. Although female political representation has been increasing, this is happening at a very slow pace and the most influential leadership roles in the EP remain dominated by men. This raises questions of the possible need to resort to stronger measures to improve female representation in the EU institutions...|$|R
25|$|One of the 28 is the President of the European Commission (currently <b>Jean-Claude</b> <b>Juncker)</b> {{appointed}} by the European Council. After the President, the most prominent Commissioner is the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, who is ex-officio a Vice-President of the Commission and is also chosen by the European Council. The other 26 Commissioners are subsequently {{appointed by}} the Council of the European Union {{in agreement with the}} nominated President. The 28 Commissioners as a single body are subject to a vote of approval by the European Parliament.|$|E
25|$|The Treaty of Lisbon doesn't {{define a}} {{nomination}} {{process for the}} President of the Council and several official and unofficial candidates were proposed. At the final European Council meeting on the treaty in Lisbon, on 19 November 2007, French President Nicolas Sarkozy set off public speculation on candidates by naming Tony Blair, Felipe González and <b>Jean-Claude</b> <b>Juncker,</b> and praising the three as worthy candidates with Blair in particular being a long time front runner for the post. However, he faced large scale opposition for being from a large state outside the eurozone and the Schengen Area {{as well as being}} a leader who entered the Iraq War which had split Europe. Minor opposition to other leaders such as Juncker also led to their rejection.|$|E
25|$|After the {{new regime}} came into force on 7 April 2017, {{significantly}} longer waiting times were reported at numerous external border crossing points, especially as it was just before the Easter holiday. Travellers entering Slovenia from Croatia (which, though a European Union member state, is not yet part of the Schengen Area) had to wait several hours as Slovenian border guards systematically checked the travel documents of all travellers (including those with the right of free movement) against relevant databases. The Prime Minister of Slovenia, Miro Cerar, acknowledged that the situation was 'unacceptable'. In order to alleviate the long queues, the systematic checking of travel documents of those with the right of free movement against relevant databases was temporarily suspended from the evening of Friday 7 April 2017 {{until the end of}} the weekend. However, the following weekend, long queues re-appeared. The Prime Minister of Croatia, Andrej Plenković, criticised the situation, calling it 'unsustainable', and expressed concern about the impact on tourism (which accounts for 18% of Croatia's GDP). The President of Croatia, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović, sent a formal letter to the European Commission to voice her concern about the effect of {{the new regime}} on border checks. At a meeting held on 29 April 2017, the President of the European Commission, <b>Jean-Claude</b> <b>Juncker,</b> Cerar and Plenković agreed that, moving forward, the systematic checking of the travel documents of those with the right of free movement against relevant databases would be suspended at land border crossing points between Croatia and Slovenia if the waiting time exceeds 15 minutes (with 'targeted checks' being carried out instead). Long queues were also reported at external border crossing points in Greece, where the leadership of the Hellenic Police (which is responsible for border checks) decided to suspend, for a period of 6 months, the systematic checking of travel documents of those with the right of free movement against relevant databases (with the exception of the Kipoi land border cossing point with Turkey, due to security concerns). Greece was particularly affected by the implementation of the new regime as Greek identity cards are not machine-readable, which meant that border guards had to enter the holder's information manually into the computer system to check the relevant databases if a Greek citizen presented an identity card instead of a passport. Similarly, long waiting times were reported at external border crossing points in France and Spain. Finland, Hungary and Italy also issued notifications suspending systematic checks at some external border crossing points. In July 2017, Greece submitted a request to suspend the systematic checking of travel documents of those with the right of free movement against relevant databases for a further period of 18 months, due to 'infrastructure shortcomings and increased traffic at 12 airports across the country'.|$|E
5000|$|The {{selection}} of the little known Jonathan Hill {{to serve as the}} United Kingdom's European Commissioner was criticised both domestically and on the continent. The position, which fell to Hill as a self described [...] "reluctant conscript", had widely been expected to go to the former Health Secretary, Andrew Lansley, former chief whip Andrew Mitchell, retiring universities minister David Willetts, or the former Conservative leader Michael Howard. Hill, who had responded [...] "non, non, non" [...] when asked if he was interested in the job just a month before the reshuffle, did not fit incoming Commission President <b>Jean-Claude</b> <b>Juncker's</b> preference for high-profile or female commissioners, leading to fears that the United Kingdom would receive an insignificant portfolio in retaliation.|$|R
40|$|In recent days, Brussels {{has been}} {{excited by the}} {{circulation}} of diagrams showing a re-organisation and allocation of posts in the new European Commission, reputedly coming from somewhere within <b>Jean-Claude</b> <b>Juncker’s</b> team. Many {{have pointed out that}} some of the appointments seem unlikely, also noting that the diagram seems to miss the Enterprise and Single Market portfolios, where it is difficult to envisage their complete merger into other portfolios, given their size and importance. In addition, not only {{is the source of the}} document unknown, it could have been leaked for a specific purpose, for example to test out the reactions in some Member States or to push individual EU countries into action, for example by appointing a woman to get a better portfolio...|$|R
40|$|The Florence School of Banking & Finance is a European {{platform}} {{bringing together}} practitioners and academics from the Banking and Finance sector {{to develop a}} common culture of regulation and supervision in the European Union. As of today, the institutional architecture of Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) looks more like the hybrid sum of ad-hoc institutions rather than a clear, lean and functional decision-making regime. Its peculiar shape is by and large {{a legacy of the}} euro crisis and results from the short-sighted institutional change that ran in parallel to the euro crisis management. Against this background, it is not surprising to see that ‘complexity of policy making’ has been identified by the European Commission as an area where improvement should be made in the future. This policy brief makes the case for streamlining EMU’s governance with a view to making it simpler and more effective. Unlike other contributions which focused on consolidating this institutional chaos via a quantum leap into a ‘deeper EMU’ or a ‘genuine EMU’, this policy brief suggests instead that the burning priority should be to address EMU’s growing complexity, leaving aside the wider philo¬sophic discussion revolving around the possible future of EMU as an autonomous polity. ‘Simpler EMU’, it argues, should be within the EU leadership’s reach. Ten months ago, the EU embarked on a new policy cycle (2014 - 2019), with new leaders at its command and new priorities set. A well-functioning EMU features high among the issues topping <b>Jean-Claude</b> <b>Juncker’s</b> agenda, only a few miles away from better regulation. Now that the storm of the financial crisis is over, there are indeed no valid reasons left to kick the can down the road any further. Moreover, given the current populist pressures to re-nationalize European policies, it should not be taken for granted that the window of opportunity for institutional re-engineering will be open for too long. Among the many institutional reforms which could be conducted, this paper advocates a rationalization of EMU’s governance on three fronts: the Euro-Summit; the Eurogroup and the EU’s financial assistance function...|$|R
500|$|The Commission {{operates}} as a cabinet government, with 28 members of the Commission (informally known as [...] "commissioners"). There is one member per member state, but members are bound by their oath of office to represent the general interest of the EU as a whole rather than their home state. One of the 28 is the Commission President (currently <b>Jean-Claude</b> <b>Juncker)</b> proposed by the European Council and elected by the European Parliament. The Council of the European Union then nominates the other 27 members of the Commission {{in agreement with the}} nominated President, and the 28 members as a single body are then subject to a vote of approval by the European Parliament. The current Commission is the Juncker Commission, which took office in late 2014.|$|E
500|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{proposals}} designed to attract greater public attention to the elections. One such innovation in the 2014 elections was that the pan-European political parties fielded [...] "candidates" [...] for president of the Commission, the so-called Spitzenkandidaten (German, [...] "leading candidate). However, European Union governance is based on a mixture of intergovernmental and supranational features: the President of the European Commission is nominated by the European Council, representing the governments of the member states, and there is no obligation for them to nominate the successful [...] "candidate". The Lisbon Treaty merely states that they should take account of the results of the elections when choosing whom to nominate. The so-called Spitzenkandidaten were [...] <b>Jean-Claude</b> <b>Juncker</b> for the European People's Party, Martin Schulz for the Party of European Socialists, Guy Verhofstadt for the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party, Ska Keller and José Bové jointly for the European Green Party and Alexis Tsipras for the Party of the European Left.|$|E
500|$|The Commission {{is led by}} a President who is {{nominated}} by the Council (in practice the European Council) and approved by Parliament. The remaining 27 Commissioners are {{nominated by}} member-states, {{in consultation with the}} President, and have their portfolios assigned by the President. The Council then adopts this list of nominee-Commissioners. The Council’s adoption of the Commission is not an area which requires the decision to be unanimous, their acceptance is arrived at according to the rules for qualified majority voting. [...] The European Parliament then interviews and casts its vote upon the Commissioners. [...] The interviews of individual nominees are conducted separately, in contrast to Parliament’s vote of approval which must be cast on the Commission as a whole without the ability to accept or reject individual Commissioners. [...] Once approval has been obtained from the Parliament the Commissioners can take office. The current President is <b>Jean-Claude</b> <b>Juncker</b> (EPP); his commission was elected in 2014.|$|E
