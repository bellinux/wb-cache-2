25|$|Quantum {{efficiency}} is most usefully {{expressed as a}} spectral measurement (that is, {{as a function of}} photon wavelength or energy). Since some wavelengths are absorbed more effectively than others, spectral measurements of quantum efficiency can yield valuable information {{about the quality of the}} semiconductor bulk and surfaces. Quantum efficiency alone is not the same as overall <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiency,</b> as it does not convey information about the fraction of power that is converted by the solar cell.|$|E
25|$|A {{solar cell}} is any device that {{directly}} converts the energy in light into electrical energy {{through the process}} of photovoltaics. Although French physicist Antoine-César Becquerel discovered the photovoltaic effect much earlier in 1839, the first solar cell, according to Encyclopædia Britannica, was invented by Charles Fritts in 1883, who used junctions formed by coating selenium with an extremely thin layer of gold. In 1941, the silicon solar cell was invented by another American named Russell Ohl. Drawing upon Ohl's work, three American researchers named Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller, and Daryl Chapin essentially introduced the first practical use of solar panels through their improvement of the silicone solar cell in 1954, which by placing them in direct sunlight, free electrons are turned into electric current enabling a six percent <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiency.</b>|$|E

30|$|In summary, {{the current}} study reveals {{potential}} of natural sensitizers extracted from rengas and mengkulang wood. The best performance was obtained when the sensitizers were mixed {{at a ratio of}} 60 %: 40 % (M:R). The HOMO and LUMO levels of all of the investigated sensitizers were calculated. The optical band gap value decreased when the sensitizers were mixed. The individual rengas and mengkulang sensitizers exhibited lower <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiencies</b> (ŋ) than their mixed forms. The low IPCE percentage was found to contribute to the low <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiencies</b> (ŋ) of the DSSCs, with the individual sensitizers achieving a lower IPCE than their mixed forms. The efficiencies obtained using these sensitizers remain low for large-scale practical applications, but the results may serve as a reference for future studies on these new natural sensitizers.|$|R

However, the longer mean free path for thermalization and absorption results in much lower <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiencies</b> ( [...] ~ 35%).|$|R
25|$|Researchers {{have found}} that using dyes {{comprising}} a perylenemonoimid (PMI) as the acceptor and an oligothiophene coupled to triphenylamine as the donor greatly improve the performance of p-DSC by reducing charge recombination rate following dye-sensitized hole injection. The researchers constructed a tandem DSC device with NiO on the p-DSC side and TiO2 on the n-DSC side. Photocurrent matching was achieved through adjustment of NiO and TiO2 film thicknesses to control the optical absorptions and therefore match the photocurrents of both electrodes. The <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the device is 1.91%, which exceeds the efficiency of its individual components, but is still much {{lower than that of}} high performance n-DSC devices (6%–11%). The results are still promising since the tandem DSC was in itself rudimentary. The dramatic improvement in performance in p-DSC can eventually lead to tandem devices with much greater efficiency than lone n-DSCs.|$|E
25|$|For {{the past}} years, {{researchers}} {{have been trying to}} reduce the price of solar cells while maximizing efficiency. Thin-film solar cell is a cost-effective second generation solar cell with much reduced thickness at the expense of light absorption efficiency. Efforts to maximize light absorption efficiency with reduced thickness have been made. Surface texturing is one of techniques used to reduce optical losses to maximize light absorbed. Currently, surface texturing techniques on silicon photovoltaics are drawing much attention. Surface texturing could be done in multiple ways. Etching single crystalline silicon substrate can produce randomly distributed square based pyramids on the surface using anisotropic etchants. Recent studies show that c-Si wafers could be etched down to form nano-scale inverted pyramids. Multicrystalline silicon solar cells, due to poorer crystallographic quality, are less effective than single crystal solar cells, but mc-Si solar cells are still being used widely due to less manufacturing difficulties. It is reported that multicrystalline solar cells can be surface-textured to yield solar <b>energy</b> <b>conversion</b> <b>efficiency</b> comparable to that of monocrystalline silicon cells, through isotropic etching or photolithography techniques. Incident light rays onto a textured surface do not reflect back out to the air as opposed to rays onto a flat surface. Rather some light rays are bounced back onto the other surface again due to the geometry of the surface. This process significantly improves light to electricity conversion efficiency, due to increased light absorption. This texture effect as well as the interaction with other interfaces in the PV module is a challenging optical simulation task. A particularly efficient method for modeling and optimization is the OPTOS formalism. In 2012, researchers at MIT reported that c-Si films textured with nanoscale inverted pyramids could achieve light absorption comparable to 30 times thicker planar c-Si. In combination with anti-reflective coating, surface texturing technique can effectively trap light rays within a thin film silicon solar cell. Consequently, required thickness for solar cells decreases with the increased absorption of light rays.|$|E
