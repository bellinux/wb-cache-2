Although the main stem of San Juan Creek <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> major water diversions or dams, some of its tributaries, including Trabuco and Oso Creeks, have been channelized or otherwise heavily modified by urbanization.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Mariana {{is connected to}} Shakespeare's Measure for Measure; {{there is a direct}} quotation of Shakespeare's play in regards to a {{character of}} the same name. In Shakespeare's play, Mariana is rejected by the character Angelo and lives alone as she pines over her love. Tennyson's version is set in Lincolnshire, not Vienna as in the Shakespeare play. This makes the characters completely English. Additionally, the scene within the poem <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> of the original context but the two works are connected in imagery {{with the idea of a}} dull life and a dejected female named Mariana.|$|E
