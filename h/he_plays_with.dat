5|$|Lapierre {{is known}} {{primarily}} as a checking forward, centring either {{the third or fourth}} line. He has a reputation as an agitator, distracting and provoking opposing players to take penalties. <b>He</b> <b>plays</b> <b>with</b> an aggressive edge and led all Canadiens forward in hits in his last full season with the club. Defensively responsible, he earns time on the penalty kill. In 2008–09, he ranked third on the Canadiens in average short handed time on ice per game.|$|E
5|$|Aboard the Doctor's TARDIS, House {{threatens to}} kill Amy and Rory. <b>He</b> <b>plays</b> <b>with</b> their senses {{as they try}} to flee through the corridors, and then sends Nephew after them. Idris makes a psychic {{connection}} with Rory to give him directions to a secondary control room (identical to the 9th and 10th Doctor's TARDIS), where he and Amy are able to lower the TARDIS's shields without House's interference. This allows the Doctor to land the makeshift TARDIS in the secondary control room, which atomises Nephew. House deletes the secondary control room as he prepares to break through the rift, which the Doctor anticipates. The TARDIS's safety protocols transfer them to the main control room, where the dying Idris releases the TARDIS's matrix back to the TARDIS, destroying House. A remnant of the TARDIS's matrix, in Idris' body, sadly states that she {{will not be able to}} speak to the Doctor again but will be there for him. Idris's body then disappears as the TARDIS matrix is fully restored.|$|E
5|$|After Cain's disappearance, Mary becomes {{head of the}} Hargreaves. Augusta {{possesses}} Alexis, {{and seeks}} out Mary in the mausoleum Cain had built before leaving to confront Alexis. Augusta reveals that she manipulated Alexis into abusing his sons and trying to resurrect her for her amusement. Before she can kill Mary, Augusta triggers Cain's trap in the mausoleum and dies. Years later, Mary is married to Oscar and pregnant with their child, although she still waits for his return. Crehador, a medium close to Cain, sets up a tea party for Mary, fulfilling Cain's promise; he then reminisces on how he found Cain being held by Riff's corpse within the ruined tower. The bunkoban-exclusive epilogue expands the ending slightly. It shows an elderly Mary, who lies on her deathbed attended by a woman nearby and hears the laughter of Jizabel's ghost as <b>he</b> <b>plays</b> <b>with</b> his pet sheep. Sensing a presence nearby, she dies, and taking the form of her ten-year-old self, her soul joins Cain hand-in-hand at a tea party with their friends and loved ones—although they exist as spirits, a boy nearby can hear them.|$|E

25|$|Two {{different}} {{oral traditions}} explain {{the use of}} the nose for playing the `ohe hano ihu. According to one, the `ohe hano ihu is played with air from the nose rather than from the mouth because a person's hā, breath, is expressive of the person's inner being. As the hā travels from the na`ao, or gut, through the mouth, the hā can be used to lie. When the hā travels through the nose, it cannot lie. Therefore, if a young man loves a woman, that love will be expressed in the music <b>he</b> <b>plays</b> <b>with</b> his `ohe hano ihu. According to the other tradition, the instrument is played with the nose to enable the player to softly sing or chant while playing.|$|E
25|$|Standing {{tall and}} {{still at the}} crease, Laxman had a keen {{awareness}} of the off-stump and a polished ability to dispatch the bad ball. <b>He</b> <b>plays</b> <b>with</b> a high elbow and a steady stance and a textbook technique with natural elegance and flair. At {{the start of his}} career, Laxman was rated by Geoffrey Boycott as one of India's best players of the hard (new) ball. However, Indian selectors played around with his batting positions, whenever India felt a lacuna regarding any batting number. He was forced to play in almost every position, including opening. Laxman found his home in the middle order, where he played most of his best innings, batting at numbers 3, 5 and 6. In a 2001 test against Australia and promoted to no. 3 in the second innings from his first innings position of 6, he scored 281 to take India to a huge lead after following on, resulting in a historic win, that also kickstarted an era of India's dominance in test cricket. Though Laxman was ideally suited for No. 3, Rahul Dravid was always preferred over him to bat at one-down. This resulted in Dravid getting opportunities to build partnerships with top and early middle-order batsmen, and score heavily. Laxman, despite being a far more aggressive and attacking batsman than Dravid (and equally skilled, with a similar test temperament), mostly came at no. 6, often finding himself stranded with tail-end batsmen, allowing him lesser number of big partnerships; this reflects in his final statistics, including total runs scored, number of centuries and average. Nevertheless, Laxman made most of this situation by garnering unprecedented support from non-specialist lower-order batsmen to save and win numerous matches for India.|$|E

500|$|In Shaw's view, the London theatres of the 1890s {{presented}} {{too many}} revivals of old plays {{and not enough}} new work. He campaigned against [...] "melodrama, sentimentality, stereotypes and worn-out conventions". As a music critic he had frequently been able to concentrate on analysing new works, but in the theatre he was often obliged {{to fall back on}} discussing how various performers tackled well-known plays. In a study of Shaw's work as a theatre critic, E. J. West writes that Shaw [...] "ceaselessly compared and contrasted artists in interpretation and in technique". Shaw contributed more than 150 articles as theatre critic for The Saturday Review, in which he assessed more than 212 productions. He championed Ibsen's plays when many theatregoers regarded them as outrageous, and his 1891 book Quintessence of Ibsenism remained a classic throughout the twentieth century. Of contemporary dramatists writing for the West End stage he rated Oscar Wilde above the rest: [...] "...our only thorough playwright. <b>He</b> <b>plays</b> <b>with</b> everything: with wit, with philosophy, with drama, with actors and audience, with the whole theatre". Shaw's collected criticisms were published as Our Theatres in the Nineties in 1932.|$|E
