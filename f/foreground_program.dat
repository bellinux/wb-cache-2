Play allows children to explore the world around them, experience new functionalities and acquire major skills (Ginsburg, 2007; Piaget, 1951 as cited in Courage & Setliff, 2010; Power, 2000). At the same time, infants and toddlers are surrounded by electronic screen media. Research has shown that very young children, even when they are only a few months old, watch television on a fairly regular basis (Courage, Murphy, Goulding, & Setliff, 2010; Vandewater et al., 2007). Given the evidence for the significance of play in very young children’s life and the considerable time spent with television, the question arises whether television exposure may affect young children’s play behavior. This study will adopt a differentiating approach, {{in the sense that it}} will distinguish between foreground and background television, and between solitary play and joint play. Based on Cohen’s attention-getting and attention-holding principles (Cohen, 1972), the first objective of this study is to explore whether television has an effect on the attention of children at play. More specifically, we might expect that background television could get the attention of young children at play, whereas foreground television could both get and hold their attention. The second objective of this study is to investigate whether television has an impact on the intensity of children’s play behavior. As research has shown that television interferes with children’s behavior, and play behavior in particular, this study sought to expand this evidence by exploring whether television disturbs children’s intensity of play. We might expect play to be more often diffuse when television is on compared to when television is off. In addition, it could be expected that foreground television would have a more profound effect on children’s play than background television. Home observations of 26 infants aged 9 months to 5 years were carried out to explore the impact of television exposure on play behavior. Log-linear analyses and post-hoc chi-square tests were conducted to explore how television and play interact. This study reveals that television exposure, especially <b>foreground</b> television <b>programming,</b> has an impact on children’s play behavior. Results indicate that background television gets children’s attention to the screen during play, while <b>foreground</b> television <b>programming</b> both gets and holds the attention of children at play. Log-linear analyses revealed that television exposure both directly and indirectly affects the intensity of children’s play. When television is on, children are more than twice as likely to play in a diffuse way. In addition, children are almost twice as likely to engage in solitary play when television is on, which in turn is associated with almost twice as much diffuse play. In situations where children are exposed to <b>foreground</b> television <b>programming,</b> children’s play {{behavior is}} almost three times more likely to be diffuse compared to situations where they are exposed to background television. This study supports the importance to distinguish between foreground and background television. First, this study confirms that both background and foreground television compete for children’s attention while they are engaged in play behavior. However, while both background and foreground television succeed in getting children’s attention to the screen, the impact of foreground television is more far-reaching. In fact, in our study, background television was never effective in holding the attention to the screen while children were at play, whereas <b>foreground</b> <b>programming</b> in some instances did receive full attention. Second, the impact of television on children’s play is different when television <b>programming</b> is <b>foreground</b> compared to when television programming is background. When television <b>programming</b> is <b>foreground,</b> children’s play behavior is almost three times more likely to be diffuse compared to situations where television programming is background. However, the results of this study show that <b>foreground</b> <b>programming</b> as well as background programming turn children’s play behavior to be diffuse. With respect to background television, this may be explained by the fact that background television draws children’s attention away from their play onto the television, whereby the play behavior becomes diffuse. With respect to foreground television, it seems possible that these findings are due to both the attention-getting and attention-holding potential. This explains why foreground television is more often associated with diffuse play: foreground television gets the attention of children, whereby attention is drawn away from their play onto the screen; additionally, foreground television holds the attention to the screen, whereby children experience difficulties to resume their play behavior. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Attempts to {{replicate}} the success of daily teen-oriented serials Neighbours and Home and Away saw the creation of Echo Point (1995) and Breakers (1999) on Network Ten. These <b>programs</b> <b>foregrounded</b> youthful attractive casts and appealing locations but the programs were not long-running successes and Neighbours and Home and Away remained the most visible and consistently successful Australian soap operas in production. In their home country, they both attracted respectable although not spectacular ratings in the early 2000s. By 2004, Neighbours was regularly attracting just under a million viewers per episode – considered at that time a low figure for Australian prime time television. By March 2007, the Australian audience for Neighbours had fallen to fewer than 700,000 a night. This prompted a revamp of the show's cast, its visual presentation, and a {{move away from the}} recently added action-oriented emphasis to refocus the show on the domestic storylines it is traditionally known for. During this period Neighbours and Home and Away continued to achieve significant ratings in the UK. This and other lucrative overseas markets, along with Australian broadcasting laws that enforce a minimum amount of domestic drama production on commercial television networks, help ensure that both programs remain in production. Both shows get higher total ratings in the UK than in Australia (the UK has three times the total population of Australia) and the UK channels make a major contribution to the production costs.|$|R

These constraints of o 2 (opaque 2) are corrected in genetically improved, hard endosperm QPM (Quality Protein Maize). An integrated strategy of phenotypic selection for endosperm modifiers and molecular marker-assisted foreground and background selection {{has been used}} in present study. The QPM donors were, CML 161, DMRQPM 58, CML 176 and CML 141 whereas, normal maize inbreds were CM 212, V 338, V 361, V 336, V 341, V 351, CM 141 and V 335. The inbreds were subjected to parental polymorphism survey between non-QPM and QPM using CIMMYT based three SSR markers, viz. phi 057, umc 1066 and phi 112. Two markers, viz. phi 057 and umc 1066 exhibited co-dominant reactions, while phi 112 was dominant in nature.

Cultural items deemed unusable, obsolete, unfashionable, repugnant, toxic, or otherwise dirty are used as a resource and {{as a means to}} access collective memory. In this way the project will redefine for itself that which is useful and that which is wasteful, thereby identifying untapped resources of creative and pragmatic material: by using abandoned gas stations (a site typology created by a piece of sweeping national legislation) the project addresses generic issues applied nationally, making the design a repeatable intervention. by identifying local examples of these generic sites, specific issues of contextual appropriateness are explored. by highlighting the previous use of the site, rather than disguising it, the thesis creates a continuity with the past, learning from and improving on the lessons of a tradition. The previous use of the site is not celebrated though a simple physical preservation, but through a continuation of the methods employed on the sites to create identity. by designing a public lavatory, issues of waste, resource, and stigma are explored. The <b>program</b> <b>foregrounds</b> issues of personal involvement (bodily necessity) in public issues (municipal infrastructure). The program addresses issues of transformation from states of use, to abandonment, to rediscovery, and follows the principle that waste equals food. by Zachary M. Kron. Thesis (M. Arch.)

40|$|During {{the past}} twenty years, Hawaiian dramatist and museum {{educator}} Victoria Nalani Kneubuhl has become established {{as one of the}} foremost playwrights working in the contemporary Pacific. Since the mid- 1980 s, a dominant strand of Kneubuhl’s oeuvre has involved a critical examination of Hawai‘i’s colonial history, using various forms of theatrical performance to interrogate historical injustices and characterizations of Hawaiian culture that erase or overwrite indigenous epistemologies, offering restorative models and, in some instances, stimulating efforts that bring about material social change. This paper surveys six of Kneubuhl’s historiographic works produced during the 1980 s and 1990 s, highlighting varied dramaturgical strategies employed to engage the cultural past in order to address contemporary concerns. The discussion distinguishes two broad theatrical genres arising from Kneubuhl’s training and work experience: historical “plays for the theatre,” which incorporate fictional or fantastic elements and are designed for repeated performance within the aesthetic and commercial frame of amateur or professional theatre production; and her “living history programs,” site- and occasion-specific performances based more directly on documentary sources and developed in consultation with historians, with a stricter pedagogical purview and a tendency toward a more realist style of presentation. This overview of Kneubuhl’s plays and <b>programs</b> <b>foregrounds</b> the important cultural interventions effected by her work during the last two decades, and contributes to an investigation of the various uses of performance in helping to construct indigenous histories in Oceania, while engaging in a broader dialogue {{about the ways in which}} theatre functions actively within the postcolonial Pacific...|$|R
40|$|Infrastructures are the {{constitutive}} {{fabric of}} both cities and non-cities, enabling exchanges of knowledge, material resources, cultural practices, and people. This lecture series proposes to consider infrastructures {{not so much}} as mechanisms of “development” but as the interface between developmental agenda and forces of adaptation, creativity, and contestation. Through the disciplinary lenses of art, architecture, history, and the social sciences, we will consider the complex relations between infrastructures as seen from above, below, and in-between. The lecture series is sponsored by the new Master’s program in Critical Urbanisms at the University of Basel. The <b>program</b> <b>foregrounds</b> both the heterogeneity of urban life and the multiplicity of ways in which human beings seek to make sense of it. Interrogating perceived oppositions—between global North and South, center and periphery, global and local, and urban and rural—the program draws together critical and reflective approaches from the humanities, social sciences and design disciplines so as to address the complexities of urban lifeworlds in the 21 st centuryThe Belgian anthropologist Filip De Boeck (University of Leuven) will speak about some of the ideas underlying Suturing the City. Living Together in Congo’s Urban Worlds (2016), a book he made in collaboration with Congolese photographer Sammy Baloji, in an attempt to rethink the urban archive and constitute it in alternative ways. If the (Central African) urban landscape seems to refuse inhabitation and appears as a black hole that makes any clear assessment of it simply disappear in the force of its corrosive gravity, the authors explore various -textual and visual, or horizontal and vertical- ways to investigate the hole and illuminate its blackness. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|During {{my final}} year of {{secondary}} education, like many young Canadians I {{was caught up in}} ‘Trudeau-mania’, enamoured of the sporty intellectual dandy, Pierre Elliot Trudeau, who was about to be elected Prime Minister. This inspired me towards a career in politics and/or foreign affairs. So it was that in 1968 that I enrolled in Glendon College, a small liberal arts college on a separate campus from the rest of York University in Toronto. Glendon was specialising in preparing would-be agents of symbolic control such as myself for public life, and offered a bilingual program for these future mandarins. Accordingly we were all enrolled in first year English and French alongside other humanities and social science subjects (and one unit in ‘natural science’ to round us off). My first year lecturer for English was Michael Gregory, a dramatic imposing figure who had recently founded the English Department at Glendon. Gregory had designed an innovative English <b>program,</b> <b>foregrounding</b> drama, stylistics and linguistics (Cha 1995, de Villiers and Stainton 2001, 2009). Like most linguists I had no idea what linguistics was before entering university, but I was soon hooked. From first year Gregory trained us in his version of scale and category grammar (inspired by Halliday 1961 and now published as Gregory 2009), stylistics (Spencer & Gregory 1964) and register theory (Gregory 1967, Gregory & Carroll 1978). And he hired a student of Gleason’s, Waldemar Gutwinski, to train us in his specialisation, cohesion (Gutwinski 1976) – as well as what was then known as transformational generative grammar and stratificational linguistics. So I was analysing cohesion in texts from 1968, at a time when discourse analysis in linguistics was still in its infancy; and while I loved grammar, analysis of textual relations beyond the sentence became my chief concern.|$|R
40|$|Museums Connect {{stands at}} the {{intersection}} of public history and public diplomacy. The program, which has both public history and public diplomacy agendas, is sponsored by the United States Department of State and administered by the American Alliance of Museums. This dissertation examines the competing impulses of transnational public history and public diplomacy made manifest in Museums Connect and its ramifications for public history theory and practice. The project demonstrates both the seeming similarities between public history’s ideas of shared authority, dialogic museum practice, and community engagement and public diplomacy’s “people-to-people” diplomacy, as well as the limits of these similarities. This dissertation also considers the ramifications of these dynamics on museum and public history practice and theory. It is shown that the assumptions of public diplomacy found in Museums Connect inform the program’s structure and operation, while also precluding a truly shared authority between the American museums and their international partners. The appointment of the American museums as “lead” museums and the Department of State’s choice to focus on young people as the target audience for the <b>program</b> <b>foregrounds</b> didactic relationships between the museums and their “communities” for the projects. Through three case studies of Museums Connect projects between the United States and Afghanistan, Morocco, and South Africa, this dissertation challenges the seminal theoretical literature of public history, articulated in Michael Frisch’s A Shared Authority, that interpretive and meaning-making authority in public history is inherently shared. Each case study reveals different factors that either promote or preclude more balanced power dynamics between the museums and their communities within the broader power dynamics established by the grant. Staff reflection-in-action, project activity and partner museum choice, and the non-American public history and museological contexts are all revealed to uniquely influence the dynamics between the museums and their communities. Throughout, the agency of the non-American participants, highlighted through the responses and reactions to the unequal dynamics of the projects, complicates notions of the singular democratic public sphere that underpin the paradigm of the museum as forum...|$|R
