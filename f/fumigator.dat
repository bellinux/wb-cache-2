40|$|Estimating the half-loss time (HLT) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{difficult}} tasks for <b>fumigators.</b> <b>Fumigators</b> assume no variation in weather conditions and rely on concentration readings from past fumigations when estimating the HLT value for a particular structure. Most of the time, fumigant overdosing is the approach taken to reduce the chance of a fumigation failure due to inaccurate HLT estimation. This results in excessive fumigant use and unnecessarily increases cost. Due to the substantial fumigation-to-fumigation variation, producing experimental replicates, in which certain parameters of interest are varied and all the other parameters are kept unchanged, is costly and almost impossible to implement. The primary objective of this study was to utilize the validated CFD models developed by Chayaprasert et al. (2006 b) to evaluate the effect of multi-year weather conditions on the gas leakage rate (i. e., HLT) and the concentration×time (Ct) product during structural fumigation in a reference flour mill. Eleven fumigation simulations were performed using historical weather data of the same time period between 1996 and 2006.

40|$|Abstract [...] Global {{potential}} of sulfuryl fluoride (SF), S 02 F 2, {{the active ingredient}} in Vikane * Gas Fumigant is being reexamined {{in light of recent}} regulatory pressures on competitive fumigants. Researchers in Europe and Japan are investigating the utility of SF as an alternative to Methyl Bromide for control of wood-infesting insects in imported lumber and structures. Presently, SF is the primary structural fumigant in the United States of America for eliminating Drywood termites (Kalotermitidae). Wood-infesting beetles such as Anobiidae and Lyctidae and common household pests such as Carpenter ants (Camponorus spp.) and cockroaches (Dictyoptera) also are target pests. SF is not an appropriate alternative for some MB uses such as soil and food commodity fumigations. SF is odorless and colorless, has a high vapor pressure and low boiling point, does not react with household items, is only slightly soluble in water. It rapidly desorbs from materials and aerates from structures. SF is highly toxic to both plants and animals. Insect eggs are less susceptible to SF than are the more active larval and adult stages. SF is not considered to be an ozone depletor or to significantly impact any global environmental processes. Lethal dosages are species specific, and for insects, are temperature dependent. Dosages are calculated using the formula: concentration of fumigant x exposure time. Length of exposure and quantity of fumigant introduced into a structure can be varied by the <b>fumigator</b> to satisfy economic and practical considerations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Bladder exstrophy {{is a rare}} {{urogenital}} abnormality. Other urogenital malformations {{have been}} associated with exposure to hormonal pesticide disruptors during critical developmental periods. This is the first report in the literature to associate household exposure to pesticides with bladder exstrophy. Case presentation We describe the pediatric environmental history of a newborn baby boy with isolated bladder exstrophy. In this case the pediatric environmental history includes the constitutional, genealogical, genetic and environmental factors related to bladder exstrophy, which revealed a cockroach infestation in the parents' home and the daily use of bug spray to kill them. The mother used one bottle of spray every 2 days (1000 cc) and more in the summer, when the problem was worse. During gestational weeks 0 - 12, the mother intensively used a domestic pesticide consisting of a mixture of pyrethroids (cyfenothrin 0. 5 %, and tetramethrin 0. 31 %) and pyriproxyfen (0. 01 %). She described repeated episodes of mild to moderate poisoning that are {{associated with the use of}} household pesticides. The mother is a housewife and the father works as a <b>fumigator</b> of fruit fields and he reported gastrointestinal symptoms associated with the use of occupational pesticides. However, he did not believe he carried traces of these products into the home and his wife washed his work clothes separately. The pyrethroids and pyriproxyfen were detected in a urine sample obtained from the child 4 months after he was born. No other risk factors were identified. Conclusions A detailed and carefully conducted pediatric environmental history, which includes information about home pesticide use, should be carried out for all children with bladder exstrophy. Domestic exposure to pesticides during critical developmental periods may have deleterious effects for the fetus. </p...|$|E

40|$|Methyl bromide is {{a highly}} toxic and {{penetrating}} compound used extensively as a soil fumigant, in greenhouses and fields for the control of nematodes, fungi, and weeds. Here we report a cluster of neurological signs and symptoms in six methyl bromide <b>fumigators</b> employed in the same company. These workers showed a high prevalence of symptoms consistent with methyl bromide toxicity: fatigue and light-headedness, erectile dysfunction, headache, insomnia, paresthesia, hearing impairment and ringing in the ears, mood changes and loss of memory and concentration. Myoclonus and unsteady gait were present in three patients, epilepsy in one. Neurobehavioral assessment revealed memory impairment, deficit of attention and learning, and reduced ability to reproduce a complex drawing.

40|$|Drip-application of {{fumigants}} is {{an effective}} fumigation practice for strawberry production in raised beds (Ajwa and Trout, 2004). Field studies have shown a 30 % emission reduction of 1, 3 -dichloropropene (1, 3 -D) when applied by drip irrigation compared to shank injection at 20 cm depth (Wang et al., 2001). The emission reduction with drip application could be further enhanced by covering the field plots with a virtually impermeable film (VIF) after the drip application (Papiernik et al. 2004). Covering the soil surface with a VIF for 10 or more days after fumigation reduced methyl bromide emissions to less than 3 % of the total amount applied (Wang et al. 1997). In a more recent study, Gao et al. (2008) achieved an enhanced reduction of 1, 3 -D and chloropicrin (CP) emission {{using a combination of}} subsurface drip application (20 cm depth) followed by covering the soil surface with a high density polyethylene film or water seal. Many grape growers in central California contract commercial <b>fumigators</b> to shank-inject 1, 3 -D and CP to control soil-borne pests during vineyard replant.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of methyl bromide (MB) and sulfuryl fluoride (SF) for managing all life {{stages of the}} red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, was investigated in the Hal Ross Flour Mill at Kansas State University. Eggs, young larvae, large larvae, pupae, and adults, confined in plastic compartments with dusting of flour and 2 -cm deep flour, were exposed at 25 mill locations to two MB and two SF fumigations; in May and August 2009. MB and SF treatments were conducted by commercial <b>fumigators,</b> and each fumigation lasted 24 h. Gas monitoring lines were placed near the bioassay boxes to measure gas concentrations over time during fumigations. Both MB treatments killed 100 % of all stages in the boxes except for large larvae in a few locations. In these locations, the mortality of large larvae ranged from 96 - 98 %. SF treatments killed 100 % of all stages except eggs. In the May treatment with SF, egg mortality ranged from 44 - 100 % with only two boxes showing 100 % mortality, because of under-dosing. Under-dosing occurred because the mill temperature {{was assumed to be}} greater than 27 ºC when it was actually below 27 ºC.

40|$|As {{a result}} of the Montreal Protocol, methyl bromide (MB), a major {{fumigant}} for the food industry, is facing a mandatory 100 percent production and import phase out. Millers, food processors and <b>fumigators</b> are looking for replacements. Sulfuryl fluoride (SF) is one replacement strategy that was recently labeled for the food market. This presentation summarizes research that is underway to compare the effectiveness of SF and MB under real world conditions. Since 2005 two SF and two MB fumigations have been completed in four different flour mills. Additional fumigations are currently underway in 2006 and will be included in the final presentation. All life stages (eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults) of two major pest species, Indianmeal moth, Plodia interpunctella (L) and red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) were used in bioassays exposed during fumigations. Insect monitoring (moth flight and beetle dome traps) was conducted before and after the fumigations to determine the existing pests population and rebound rates. Current results indicate 100 % mortality of larval and adult stages of both species for both fumigants. In addition, SF had 100 % mortality of the pupal stage, but low initial survivorship of the egg stage. The majority (99. 3 %) of RFB larvae from treated eggs died before the adult stage. MB had 100 % mortality of IMM pupae and RFB eggs but extremely low RFB pupal survivorship (0. 4 %) in one facility and 95. 4 % mortality of IMM eggs in the other.
