50|$|To {{the left}} of the transceivers, the list of pixel data bits {{transmitted}} over that Channel Link is printed, from LSB to MSB. The characters L, F and D refer to the Line Sync, Frame Sync and <b>Data</b> <b>Valid</b> bits, respectively. The underscore represents an unused spare bit. It remains to be said how pixel data bits are assigned to the bits 0 to 71 used in the figure. For grey-scale pixels, this is a trivial one-to-one mapping; for colour pixels with a multiple of 8 bits per colour, the colours are simply concatenated in the order red, green and blue (from LSB to MSB). For 12-bit RGB data, the lower 8 bits of each colour are assigned to data bits 0-7,16-23,32-39; the higher 4 bits of each colour to bits 8-11,12-15,40-43.|$|E

50|$|In 2005 Zuxxez Entertainment hired {{law firm}} Schutt-Waetke to charge more than 18,000 German filesharers for {{copyright}} violation. Fines between 150 and 650 Euros were levied. The producer Dirk Hassinger had noticed there {{were far more}} players on the online game server than registered buyers (all the game's copy protections systems had been hacked and a small program was automatically generating serial numbers), leading him to start monitoring the filesharing networks for illegal shares. The Swiss firm Logistep offered him a package that would gather <b>data</b> <b>valid</b> for legal actions and automatically generate the charges ready for digital submission to the court in Karlsruhe. Two weeks later Hassinger's lawyer submitted one CD-ROM containing 13,700 charges to the court, each one also printed as a courtesy. By post each defendant received an offer: pay 50 Euros and the case would be dropped. Hassinger's lawyers also sent demands that each downloader sign an undertaking to never again share copyrighted software, plus an invoice for 200 to 500 Euros.|$|E
50|$|Camera Link uses one {{to three}} Channel-link {{transceiver}} chips with four links at 7 serial bits each.At a minimum, Camera Link uses 28 bits to represent up to 24 bits of pixel data and 3 bits for video sync signals, leaving one spare bit.The video sync bits are <b>Data</b> <b>Valid,</b> Frame Valid, and Line Valid. The data are serialized 7:1, and the four data streams and a dedicated clock are driven over five LVDS pairs. The receiver accepts the four LVDS data streams and LVDS clock, andthen drives the 28 bits and a clock to the board.The camera link standard calls for these 28 bits to be transmitted over 4 serializeddifferential pairs with a serialization factor of 7. The parallel data clock is transmittedwith the data. Typically a 7× clock must be generated by a PLL or SERDES block in order to transmit or receive the serialized video. To deserialize the data,a shift register and counter may be employed. The shift register catches each of the serialized bits, one at a time, then registers the data out into the parallel clock domain - oncethe data counter has reached its terminal value.|$|E

30|$|The first module ALTDDIO is {{used with}} two input constants, with data_high signal {{connected}} to VCC (logic high) and data_low signal connected to GND (logic low).

30|$|The {{transmission}} module, called Transmitter, {{is responsible}} for sending the data correctly through the bus. It is also its responsibility to align the clock with the availability of data on the bus, thus increasing utilization of the <b>data</b> <b>valid</b> window, and to re-transmit the data if an error occurs in transmission. The transmitter also has a module for generating CRC for the data sent. After transmitting a data package, a checksum that validates the package is sent through the bus to be checked at the receiver. If errors are found during the verification, a request for retransmission is performed.|$|E
