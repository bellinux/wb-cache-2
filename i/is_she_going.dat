500|$|In an {{interview}} with Digital Spy, Gray said of her character's persona: I never {{wanted her to be}} boring. She was never boring before–she started out kind of boring, but I think that's the kiss of death because people will expect her to be interesting. By interesting, that doesn't mean she's drunk. I had {{to do a lot of}} thinking about what we would do with her. Where would she be now? I did a lot of homework finding out where she would be and what Texas women are like now. What has she gone through in her life? What has she come to grips with? What does she like about herself? What doesn't she like about herself? What kind of impact <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to make on her life, on John Ross's life, on her future? Who is she? ...|$|E
500|$|The episode flashbacks to the {{previous}} developments of several storylines throughout the season, including the love triangle between Rick, Shane, and Lori. Mazzara iterated that upon hearing of her husband's revelations, Lori was conflicted with several issues. [...] "All of that is going through Lori's mind. Rick murdered Shane and she did confess she had feelings for Shane. Her son {{was a part of}} it. They're all infected. Is her baby infected? We're out on the road, where <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to give birth? What happens if the baby dies? What happens if she dies? All of these questions are going through her head. The thing that affects her most is that she played a role in Shane's death. She put those two men at odds, she whispered in Rick's ear and then she talked to Shane at the windmill. She realizes that this has been over her, and in a sense she has been an active participant in Shane's death. So she can blame Rick for that, but she's horrified by her own culpability." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Nich Maragos and David Smith of 1UP.com ranked Ibuki as {{the sixth}} overall best ninja {{character}} in video games, calling her [...] "{{one of the}} coolest-looking characters" [...] in Street Fighter III but [...] "also {{one of the least}} capable in competition." [...] That same year, Aubrey Sitterson of UGO featured her on a list of the 25 [...] "foxiest fighting females to ever be pixelated" [...] and commented that Ibuki is [...] "not only super-hot, but she's also a ninja, which is like a 'chocolate in my peanut butter' situation." [...] UGO's Paul Furfari further stated that she [...] "set the new standard in female fighters," [...] adding, [...] "forget Chun-Li". GameZone included the [...] "amazing" [...] Ibuki in their 2011 list of [...] "best video game ninjas" [...] and stated: [...] "We’re glad she’s still a staple in this series to this very day – but when <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to come over to Marvel vs. Capcom territory?" [...] Márcio Pacheco Alexsandro of Brazil's Game Hall placed her at tenth spot of his 2014 list of top kunoichi characters in games, opining that she is [...] "far from having such status as Chun-Li, but has her charm, especially if you like Japanese schoolgirls." [...] Joe Pring from WhatCulture.com placed Ibuki at 19th spot on his 2015 list of the greatest female fighting game characters of all time: [...] "Ninja's are always cool, but Ibuki takes that awesome factor to a whole new level." [...] In 2016, Steven Hanson from Destructoid described her as [...] "everybody's favorite schoolgirl ninja." [...] A poll for the most erotic girl in the history of fighting games conducted by Japanese web portal Goo had Ibuki and Ayane, a schoolgirl female ninja from Dead or Alive, share the 11th/12th place (out of 50 contesters) in 2016.|$|E
60|$|Where <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to? <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to a {{place called}} Roxham; here it was written on the ticket. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be {{companion}} to a dear young lady, very rich, like all the English, whom she had met when she had travelled with her French family to Jersey, a Miss Lee.|$|R

6000|$|Gyp, who {{was sitting}} at her bureau, seemed to be adding up the counterfoils in her cheque-book. She did not turn round, and Fiorsen paused. How <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to receive him? ...|$|R
2500|$|JR is {{eventually}} informed of Babe's one-night stand with Josh {{by her father}} (David Hayward). Not believing it, even when Josh confirms the encounter, viewers saw JR try {{to move on with}} his life and be happy with Babe. Once his suspicion gets the better of him, however, he confronts Babe about the matter. Babe tells the truth, and, in a dramatic fashion, JR later throws himself out a two-story window while drunk. While recovering, he insists that he no longer loves Babe. To add further conflict, Babe is written as thoroughly determined to win JR back; she undermines his wishes not to live with her. [...] "Babe is at the Chandler mansion. JR is home from the hospital and Babe isn't letting up," [...] said Havins. [...] "She's very dedicated to getting through to him. She's not saying, 'Let's get back together and forget anything ever happened.' It's more like, 'Let's try to move forward.' They aren't having an 'I love you' moment or anything like that, but she breaks the ice a little bit." [...] In addition, Babe's refusal to let JR go is happening during a serial killer arc, where Babe's life is in danger and one of her good friends (Erin Lavery) has just been murdered by the killer. In a moment where Babe confides to JR about this, viewers again witnessed the couple's star-crossed theme. [...] "He's sleeping and she is crying at his bedside and says, 'I need you so much.' Not only <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> through this, but she doesn't have her rock and best friend to lean on," [...] stated Havins. [...] "It's a lonely place to be. He opens his eyes and almost makes the move to connect — but then he doesn't." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Tis {{certain that}} Amy {{had no more}} {{business}} at Greenwich than I had, nor <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> thither; but we were all hampered to the last degree with the impertinence of this creature; and, in particular, I was horribly perplexed with it.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> {{certain that}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not <b>going</b> {{to drive to}} Seattle. <b>She</b> wasn't <b>going</b> to drive anywhere! <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to freight the car back to Minneapolis, and herself go back by train--Pullman!--drawing-room! ...|$|R
60|$|And now whither <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going?</b> Like the poor, dead leaf of the song, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> wastrel, {{torn from}} the parent bough, homeless, friendless, having {{turned against the}} one hand which, in this great time of peril, had been {{extended}} to her in kindness and in love.|$|R
6000|$|... "And Amy, what <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to do?" [...] asked Mrs. March, well {{pleased at}} Laurie's {{decision}} {{and the energy}} with which he spoke.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Let me go--let me go!' {{she only}} repeated, with her high, quavering, distracted note; {{and as he}} moved a little she got the door open.

60|$|Ursula's heart sank. Everybody {{seemed so}} cocksure and so bossy. How <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> {{to get on}} with such jolty, jerky, bossy people? And Miss Harby had not spoken a word to the man at the table. She simply ignored him. Ursula felt the callous crude rudeness between the two teachers.|$|R
40|$|On a startlingly bright autumn {{night in}} 2006, Harper Regan {{walked away from}} her home, her husband and daughter, and kept walking. She told nobody that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going.</b> <b>She</b> told nobody where <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going.</b> <b>She</b> put {{everything}} she ever built at risk. For two lost days and nights, until {{it looked as though}} her entire life might unravel, she didn't turn back. From Uxbridge to Stockport to Manchester and back again, Harper Regan navigates the UK, exploring family, love and delusion. It received its world premiere at the National Theatre, London, in 2008...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{particular}} reason! Why, the Antelope is a privateer; and if <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> {{to cruise}} about, {{that means that}} <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to fight, and he may get shot." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't know that; but <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not <b>going</b> {{to break}} down. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to drag out the engagement, {{in the hope}} of making me relent." ...|$|R
60|$|But <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> {{to fulfill}} her {{deliberate}} intention? <b>She</b> began to <b>be</b> afraid of herself, {{and to find}} out a certain difficulty in doing as she liked. Already her assertion of independence in evading his advances had been carried farther than <b>was</b> necessary, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> thinking with some anxiety what she might do on the next occasion.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, that {{is where}} we are going; at least, Constance <b>is.</b> <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to work at her {{painting}} while I pay a round of visits. Wont you come with us?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'd {{like her}} to protect you, would you?" [...] Graveling taunted. [...] "Listen here. I'm {{not the sort of}} man to have my girl taken away and made another man's plaything. <b>Is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to stop here? Answer me quickly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've said nothing. Don't like house-cleaning {{well enough}} to suggest it. I did think the hall was rather dirty when I dropped my coat and took it up covered with lint. <b>Is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to upset the whole place?" [...] asked Mr. Bemis, looking alarmed at the prospect.|$|E
6000|$|... "We want to {{know how}} she feels about to-night; what report she makes of her nerves, her anticipations; how she looked, what she had on, up to six o'clock. Gracious! if I could see her I should know what I wanted, and so would she, I guess!" [...] Mr. Pardon exclaimed. [...] "You must know something, Mrs. Luna; it isn't natural you shouldn't. I won't inquire any further where she is, because that might seem a little pushing, if she does wish to {{withdraw}} herself--though I am bound to say I think she makes a mistake; we could work up these last hours for her! But can't you tell me any little personal items--the sort of thing the people like? What <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to have for supper? or <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> to speak--a--without previous nourishment?" ...|$|E
6000|$|With {{these words}} {{she lifted her}} eyes and looked him {{straight}} in the face.

60|$|The Queen {{appeared}} before her Army {{dressed in an}} imposing uniform of green, covered with gold braid. She wore a green soldier-cap with a purple plume in it and looked so royal and dignified that everyone in Oogaboo except the Army <b>was</b> glad <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going.</b> The Army <b>was</b> sorry <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not <b>going</b> alone.|$|R
60|$|And {{they were}} gloomy enough. Where <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going?</b> How long <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> for? What <b>was</b> <b>she</b> {{to do when}} there? On all these points <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{absolutely}} ignorant. What was the object of this sudden flight from London? Her guardian could have separated her from the Dimsdales in many less elaborate ways than this. Could it be that he intended some system of pressure and terrorism by which <b>she</b> should <b>be</b> forced to accept Ezra as a suitor. She clenched her little white teeth as she thought of it, and registered a vow that nothing in this world would ever bring her to give in upon that point. There was only one bright spot in her outlook. When she reached her destination she would at once write to Mrs. Dimsdale, tell her where <b>she</b> <b>was,</b> and ask her frankly for an explanation of their sudden silence. How much wiser if she had done so before. Only a foolish pride had withheld her from it.|$|R
