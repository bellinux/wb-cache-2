5|$|Andronikos {{began his}} reign well; in particular, the {{measures}} {{he took to}} reform {{the government of the}} empire have been praised by historians. In the provinces, Andronikos' reforms produced a speedy and marked improvement. Andronikos's fierce determination to root out corruption and many other abuses was admirable; under Andronikos, the sale of offices ceased; selection was based on merit, rather than favouritism; officials were paid an adequate salary so as to reduce the temptation of bribery. <b>Every</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> corruption was eliminated with ferocious zeal.|$|E

25|$|When {{new forms}} of {{communication}} came into existence in the 19th and early 20th centuries the GPO claimed monopoly rights {{on the basis that}} like the postal service they involved delivery from a sender and to a receiver. The theory was used to expand state control of the mail service into <b>every</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> electronic communication possible on the basis that every sender used some form of distribution service. These distribution services were considered in law as forms of electronic post offices. This applied to telegraph and telephone switching stations.|$|E

25|$|Radiation therapy {{may be used}} {{to treat}} almost every type of solid tumor, {{including}} cancers of the brain, breast, cervix, larynx, liver, lung, pancreas, prostate, skin, stomach, uterus, or soft tissue sarcomas. Radiation is also used to treat leukemia and lymphoma. Radiation dose to each site depends on a number of factors, including the radio sensitivity of each cancer type and whether there are tissues and organs nearby that may be damaged by radiation. Thus, as with <b>every</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> treatment, radiation therapy is not without its side effects.|$|E
25|$|The WICB {{announced}} its central contracts in November 2009, and Sammy {{was included in}} the 33-man list. He was given a GradeB contract (the second-highest level) worth $80,000. His career-best Man of the Match figures of 4–26 in the third ODI in Saint Vincent & the Grenadines would have been more flattering still had captain Chris Gayle been able to hold on to a catch that would have given the tall Saint Lucian the distinction of becoming the first West Indian to take a five-fer in <b>every</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> the game; he had 5–26 off the same opponents in a Twenty20 International earlier in the series. West Indies bowled Zimbabwe for 104, having made 245.|$|E
25|$|The Justification Hypothesis (JH) {{is a novel}} {{proposal}} that allows for both {{the understanding of the}} evolution of culture and for identifying what makes humans distinct animals. A basic initial claim of the JH is that the process of justification is a crucial component of human mental behavior at both the individual and societal level. Unlike all other animals, humans everywhere ask for and give explanations for their actions. Arguments, debates, moral dictates, rationalizations, and excuses all involve the process of explaining why one's claims, thoughts or actions are warranted. In virtually <b>every</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> social exchange, from warfare to politics to family struggles to science, humans are constantly justifying their behavioral investments to themselves and others.|$|E
50|$|In his Aphorisms on the Wisdom of Life, Arthur Schopenhauer rejects nationalism, {{seeing it}} as an {{abandonment}} of personal identity. The philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche {{can also be seen}} as opposing all <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> nationalism, although he opposed virtually <b>every</b> other <b>form</b> <b>of</b> social movement and ideology as well. Søren Kierkegaard's philosophy is a criticism and vehement rejection of Christian nationalism.|$|R

25|$|Secular Franciscans {{are called}} {{to make their own}} contribution, {{inspired}} by the person and message of Francis, towards a civilization in which the dignity of the human person, shared responsibility, and love may be living realities. They should firmly commit themselves to oppose <b>every</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> exploitation, discrimination, and exclusion and against every attitude of indifference in relation to others. They promote the building of fraternity among peoples: they should be committed to create worthy conditions of life for all and to work for the freedom of all people. Secular Franciscans attempt to be in the forefront in the field of public life. They should collaborate as much as possible for the passage of just laws and ordinances.|$|E
25|$|For Francis, {{work is a}} {{gift and}} to work is a grace. Daily work {{is not only the}} means of livelihood, but the {{opportunity}} to serve God and neighbor as well as a way to develop one's own personality. In the conviction that work is a right and a duty and that <b>every</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> occupation deserves respect, the brothers and sisters should commit themselves to collaborate so that all persons may have the possibility to work and so that working conditions may always be more humane. Leisure and recreation have their own value and are necessary for personal development. Secular Franciscans should maintain a balance between work and rest and should strive to make meaningful use of their leisure time.|$|E
25|$|The {{predecessor}} of {{the medieval}} bestiary, compiled in Late Antiquity and known as Physiologus (Φυσιολόγος), popularized an elaborate allegory in which a unicorn, trapped by a maiden (representing the Virgin Mary), stood for the Incarnation. As soon as the unicorn sees her, it lays its head on her lap and falls asleep. This became a basic emblematic tag that underlies medieval notions of the unicorn, justifying its appearance in <b>every</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> religious art. Interpretations of the unicorn myth focus on the medieval lore of beguiled lovers, whereas some religious writers interpret the unicorn and its death as the Passion of Christ. The myths refer to a beast with one horn {{that can only be}} tamed by a virgin; subsequently, some writers translated this into an allegory for Christ's relationship with the Virgin Mary.|$|E

25|$|The B mastopexy (breast lift) is a {{variation}} of the circumvertical approach that features an inverted, upper-case letter-B incision, which, when performed with simultaneous breast augmentation via submuscular or subglandular implantation of the breast prosthesis, restores the natural contour and appearance of the breasts. Moreover, the B mastopexy technique can procedurally include the simultaneous microliposuction to reduce the lateral parenchymal and adipose tissues in order to achieve the correct size, volume, and contour of the corrected breasts. The B mastopexy can correct several types of breast deformity, <b>every</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> breast ptosis, and breast hypertrophy; it usually has low incidence rates of hypertrophic scarring, and of loss of sensation in the nipple-areola complex; furthermore, the B mastopexy technique also applies to reduction mammoplasty, the correction of oversized breasts.|$|E
25|$|In Germany, a {{relatively}} new law, which {{has been established in}} 2013, strengthens the rights of patients. It states, amongst other things, the statutory duty of medical personnel to document the treatment of the patient in either hard copy or within the electronic patient record (EPR). This documentation must happen in a timely manner and encompass each and <b>every</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> treatment the patient receives, as well as other necessary information, such as the patient’s case history, diagnoses, findings, treatment results, therapies and their effects, surgical interventions and their effects, as well as informed consents. The information must include virtually everything that is of functional importance for the actual, but also for future treatment. This documentation must also include the medical report and must be archived by the attending physician for at least 10 years. The law clearly states that these records are not only memory aids for the physicians, but also should be kept for the patient and must be presented on request.|$|E
25|$|Malthus went on {{to argue}} that under such ideal conditions, the {{population}} could conceivably double every 25 years. However, the food supply could not continue doubling at this rate for even 50 years. The food supply would become inadequate for the growing population, and then:...the mighty law of self-preservation expels all the softer and more exalted emotions of the soul.... The corn is plucked before it is ripe, or secreted in unfair proportions; and the whole black train of vices that belong to falsehood are immediately generated. Provisions no longer flow in {{for the support of}} the mother with a large family. The children are sickly from insufficient food.... No human institutions here existed, to the perverseness of which Mr. Godwin ascribes the original sin of the worst men. No opposition had been produced by them between public and private good. No monopoly had been created of those advantages which reason directs to be left in common. No man had been goaded to the breach of order by unjust laws. Benevolence had established her reign in all hearts: and yet in so short a period as within fifty years, violence, oppression, falsehood, misery, every hateful vice, and <b>every</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> distress, which degrade and sadden the present state of society, seem to have been generated by the most imperious circumstances, by laws inherent in the nature of man, and absolutely independent of it human regulations.|$|E
