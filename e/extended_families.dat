40|$|<b>Extended</b> <b>family</b> {{relationship}} and support are important protective factors for families undergo stress-inducing life {{events such as}} divorce. As families go through several readjustments and reorganizations following divorce, <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> interactions both affect and are affected by these changes. In addition, <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> members can provide support for post-divorce adjustment and relationships. Existing literature provided valuable insights regarding post-divorce <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> relationships but they were mostly conducted over 25 years ago. The field of family therapy emphasizes and encourages the inclusion of <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> members in therapy sessions. Despite the importance of <b>extended</b> <b>family,</b> there is no empirical study exploring its involvement in family therapy sessions.

5|$|The city {{is built}} on the slope {{surrounding}} the citadel, located on a dominating plateau. Although the city's walls {{were built in the}} third century and the city itself was first mentioned in the 12th century, the majority of the existing buildings date from 17th and 18th centuries. Typical houses consist of a tall stone block structure which can be up to five stories high. There are external and internal staircases that surround the house. It is thought that such design stems from fortified country houses typical in southern Albania. The lower storey of the building contains a cistern and the stable. The upper storey is composed of a guest room and a family room containing a fireplace. Further upper stories are to accommodate <b>extended</b> <b>families</b> and are connected by internal stairs. Since Gjirokastër's membership to UNESCO, a number of houses have been restored, though others continue to degrade.|$|E
5|$|Chinese kinship {{relations}} {{during the}} Han {{were influenced by}} Confucian mores and involved both immediate nuclear family and extended family members. The Chinese family was patrilineal, since a father's sons did not consider a mother's kin {{to be part of}} their clan; instead, they were considered 'outside relatives'. The Han dynasty law code inherited the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE) law that any family with more than two sons had to pay extra taxes. This was not repealed until the Cao Wei period (220–265 CE). The average Han family under one household typically had about four or five immediate family members, which was unlike the large <b>extended</b> <b>families</b> under one household in later dynasties. It was common during Han to send adult married sons away with a portion of the family fortune and visit them occasionally, yet in all dynasties during and after the Tang dynasty (618–907 CE), a son who moved away and lived separately from his living parents would be considered a criminal. Larger families appeared during the Eastern Han when some married brothers chose to live with each other's families. However, a household with three generations living under its roof was incredibly rare. This is in contrast to the Jin dynasty (265–420), when having three or more generations under one roof was commonplace.|$|E

His uncle had been educated by the American Protestant missionary Levi Chamberlain and had served his entire life as a personal assistant and servant to King Kamehameha III and later his successor Kamehameha IV. Iaukea {{was taken to the}} kingdom's capital at Honolulu to live with Kaihupaʻa and his wife Keliaipala. They lived near the grounds of the old ʻIolani Palace, in the building of the former Royal School. Renamed Halepoepoe (meaning circular or round house), this building had been turned into a home for royal retainers and the kahu (caretakers) for the reigning King Kamehameha IV. Around the time he was five or six, Iaukea fell into a well and his uncle Kaihupaʻa broke his foot in the process of saving him, later dying from the injuries he sustained.|$|E
40|$|What is {{the basic}} {{economic}} decision-making unit? Is it the household or the <b>extended</b> <b>family?</b> This question is fundamental to economic analysis and policy design. The answer given by the Life Cycle and Keynesian models is that the economic unit is the household. According to these models, members of particular households act selfishly and do not fully share resources with <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> members in other households. Hence, altering the distribution of resources across households within the <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> will alter the consumption and labor supply of those households who acquire or lose resources. In contrast to the Life Cycle and Keynesian models, the altruism model implies that the <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> {{is the basic}} economic decision-making unit. According to this model the <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> is linked through altruism and, as a result, acts as if it fully shares resources. In the altruism model nondistortionary changes {{in the distribution of}} resources across households within the <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> will have no effect on the consumption or labor supply of any of its members. Despite its importance, the boundaries of economic decision-making units have not, to our knowledge, been examined directly with micro data. Stated differently, the altruism model has not been tested against the Life Cycle and Keynesian alternatives with such data. This paper uses matched data on parents and their adult children, contained in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, to perform such a test. In essence our test asks whether the distribution of consumption and labor supply across households within the <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> depends on the distribution of resources across households within the <b>extended</b> <b>family.</b> Our findings provide quite strong evidence against the altruism model. The distribution of resources across households within the <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> is a highly significant (statistically and economically) determinant of the distribution of onsumption within the <b>extended</b> <b>family.</b> This finding holds for the entire sample as well as the subsample consisting of rich parents and poor children. In addition to showing that the distribution of <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> resources matters for <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> consumption, we test the life cycle model by asking whether only own resources matter, i. e., whether the resources of <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> members have no affect on a household's consumption. Our results indicate that <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> member resources have, at most, a modest effect on household consumption after one has controlled for the fact that <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> resources help predict a household's own permanent income. ...|$|R

50|$|Jones, Zalot, Foster, Sterrett, and Chester {{executed}} a study examining the childrearing assistance given to young adults and African-American single mothers.

In Jones research she also notes that 97% of single mother's ages 28-40 admitted that they rely {{on at least one}} <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> member for assistance in raising their children. <b>Extended</b> <b>family</b> members have an immense amount of responsibility in the majority of African-American families, especially single parent households. According to Jones, the reason these <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> members are included in having a necessary role in the family is because they {{play a key role in}} assuring the health and well-being of the children. The <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> members' responsibilities range from child rearing, financial assistance, offering a place to live, and meals.|$|R
40|$|Background: Childhood {{obesity is}} a public health problem with {{significant}} long-term implications and racial/ethnic disparities. African American <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> members {{play a significant role}} in child rearing and socialization, and research suggests that grandparents, in general, may influence children’s weight-related behaviors. There is, however, a lack of research exploring how urban African American children’s relationships with <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> members may influence children’s weight-related behaviors. Therefore, this study examines how <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> members’ roles and responsibilities may influence urban African American children’s weight-related behaviors, how <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> members socialize children to adopt weight-related behaviors, and how <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> members’ socialization practices may differ from those of primary caregivers. Methods: This study builds upon and extends the work of a previous, mixed-methods study of 31 primary caregiver-child dyads, which was designed to examine household and neighborhood factors related to childhood obesity. In Phase 2, individual semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with 8 Baltimore City children; paired interviews were conducted with their primary caregivers and one adult member of each child’s <b>extended</b> <b>family.</b> Manuscript 1 combines qualitative data from both studies to present case studies of the 4 families that participated in both studies. Manuscripts 2 and 3 focus on data collected from Phase 2 ’s 8 family units, and present detailed analyses of familial influences on children’s physical activity and dietary behaviors, respectively. Findings: Manuscript 1 indicates that mothers and <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> members may differ in their influences on children’s weight-related behaviors, which may be related to differences in the adults’ roles and responsibilities with the children. Manuscript 2 suggests that <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> members may be more physically active with children; this may be influenced by perceived familial closeness and different relationship dynamics. Manuscript 3 indicates that children are consistently taught to value food-based family traditions; however, adults may be inconsistent in the socialization strategies used in day-to-day dietary routines. These findings suggest that future family-based obesity interventions for African American children should extend beyond the immediate family to include key <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> members and consider the <b>extended</b> <b>family</b> networks’ norms and values...|$|R
