40|$|The lmodern {{energy systems}} are in deep mutation, with {{electricity}} taking a bigger part every day. The integration of energetic systems {{is the ability}} to design these devices by assembling the most diverse and heterogeneous electrical equipments. To be successful, the integration process must lead to a performant, economical and easy-to-assemble system. The robustness of a device {{is the ability to}} cope with an uncertain environment. When all the equipments that constitute a system are robust, their integration should not be a problem. The standards {{are at the heart of}} the integration problem. They define common denominators to the equipment of a system and exist to ensure their integration. They have a decisive impact on the performances and cost of a system. The question to be asked is about the relationship between standards and robustness: to obtain an optimal system, it is better to constrain the standards or to impose a high level of robustness to equipments? This problem will, here be illustrated through the dynamic sizing of a <b>DC</b> <b>generation</b> <b>system</b> for an aircraft electrical network. We will be especially interested by the dynamial sizing process of the equipment that will lead to a better integrated system and we will particularly study how the notion of robustness would facilitate the integration...|$|E

40|$|The {{functional}} properties of myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) differ, depending on microenvironmental factors {{as well as}} on their stage of maturation. The main approaches for the selective enhancement of the tolerogenic properties of DCs include the induction of a pharmacological arrest of the DCs maturation and the genetical engineering of DCs expressing immunosuppressive molecules. Several immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory agents have been discovered that potentially inhibit DC maturation and immunogenicity. Photopheresis (ECP) is an immunomodulatory therapy in which leucocytes are exposed to 8 -methoxypsoralen (8 -MOP) and ultraviolet (UV) A radiation (PUVA). The combination of ECP with immunosuppressive agents has demonstrated efficacy in the management of transplanted patients by reducing either the incidence of organ rejection or the pharmacological toxicity. In particular, we have observed in hepatitis C virus (HCV) -positive patients that the same combination has reduced the immunosuppressive burden and improved sustainability and efficacy of pre-emptive antiviral therapy after liver transplantation. Therefore, in our work we investigated the in vitro effects of PUVA, combined with immunosuppressive drugs (IDs), on both in vitro human <b>DC</b> <b>generation</b> and maturation, in order to contribute to understanding the immunological mechanisms underlying this pharmacological combination. Monocyte PUVA-treatment was performed by using an in vitro experimental protocol that we previously described. PUVA-treated or -untreated highly purified CD 14 + cells were incubated with the association of the immunosuppressive drugs, used in the management of liver transplantation, at two different concentrations, in the presence of IL- 4 and GM-CSF. The treatment with IDs at the highest concentration (corresponding to that used in clinical practice), alone or in association with PUVA, induced an immunosuppressive effect, by impairing both <b>DC</b> <b>generation</b> and maturation. Neither immunosuppressive drugs at the lowest concentration nor their combination with PUVA affected myeloid <b>DC</b> <b>generation,</b> but modified <b>DC</b> functions, strengthening the induction of a tolerogenic pattern. As this ID concentration was arbitrarily chosen, further experiments could highlight whether lower concentrations than those used in clinical practice would elicit the same effect on DCs and potentially improve their {{functional properties}}. This work describes an original experimental approach exploring the in vitro mechanism of action of the combined procedure of PUVA with immunosuppressive drugs, used in liver transplantation, on <b>DCs</b> <b>generation</b> and function.
