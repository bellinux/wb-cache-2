40|$|Exchanging CAD model data among {{heterogeneous}} CAD {{systems is}} indispensable for collaborative product development. Currently, the industry mainly uses the standardized neutral files based methods to implement such exchange. While {{at the same}} time, the application of Web Ontology Language (OWL) file and underlying Semantic Web technologies in CAD model data exchange is gaining importance and popularity within the academia. The coexistence {{of different types of}} methods has generated a series of controversies and questions within the industry and the academia. Yet, can the neutral <b>files</b> based <b>exchange</b> methods completely implement model data exchange among heterogeneous CAD systems? What challenges have been addressed to date by the developed CAD model data exchange standards? Why OWL has been introduced to CAD model data exchange? Does CAD model data exchange really need OWL? Are there any issues in existing neutral <b>files</b> based <b>exchange</b> methods and OWL <b>file</b> based <b>exchange</b> methods need to be addressed in future studies? This paper proposes to conduct a study of the standardized neutral <b>files</b> based <b>exchange</b> methods and OWL <b>file</b> based <b>exchange</b> methods. An in-depth analysis of the widely used STandard for the Exchange of Product model data (STEP) method and the newly emerging OWL methods is firstly provided.
