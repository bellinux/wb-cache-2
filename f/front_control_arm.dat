50|$|The Mark 2 {{series is}} the longest running Jetta so far. Introduced to Europe in early 1984 and to North America in 1985, the second {{generation}} Jetta {{proved to be a}} sales success for Volkswagen. The car secured the title of best-selling European car in North America, Farmer's Journal COTY 1991 and outsold the similar Golf by two-to-one in that market. Based on the all new second generation Golf platform, the car was larger, heavier, and could seat five people instead of four as in the Mark 1. Exterior dimensions increased in all directions. Overall length was up by 100 millimetres (3.9 in), the wheelbase grew 66 millimetres (2.6 in), and the width went up 53 millimetres (2.1 in). The suspension setup was basically unchanged from the first generation, although refined slightly, for example by the inclusion of a separate subframe for mounting the <b>front</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> to help noise isolation, as well as improved rubber mountings for all components. Aerodynamics improved considerably, with a drag coefficient of 0.36. With a 470-litre (16.6 ft3) luggage compartment, the trunk had grown nearly as large as some full-sized American sedans. Interior room was also increased 14%, which changed the EPA class from sub-compact to compact.|$|R

40|$|In {{an ongoing}} search for better vehicle fuel economy, the {{automotive}} industry has put significant emphasis on the reduction of vehicle weight while retaining stringent safety, quality and performance standards. With its high specific stiffness, strength, and fatigue performance under typical automotive service conditions, forged magnesium is a potential material to fill these requirements. Investigating an existing <b>front</b> lower <b>control</b> <b>arm,</b> engineering specifications were developed to evaluate {{the performance of a}} forged magnesium replacement. Combining a design volume derived from a kinematic CAD model and the produced engineering specifications, an optimization design space was created, and a component optimized within it using Altair Optistruct. Based on this optimized result an initial design was created in CAD, and design-analysis iterations conducted until it was structurally equivalent to the baseline design. This initial detail design produced a mass savings of 39 % over the benchmark cast aluminum <b>control</b> <b>arm,</b> and only failed to challenge it in fatigue. It is expected that future designs will improve fatigue performance with little added mass, while continuing to integrate improving knowledge about the forging and mechanical performance of magnesium alloys...|$|R

40|$|The ongoing {{drive for}} lighter and more {{efficient}} structural components by the commercial engineering industry {{has resulted in the}} rapid adoption of the finite element method (FE) for design analysis. Satisfied with the success of finite elements in reducing prototyping costs and overall production times, the industry has begun to look at other areas where the finite element method can save time, and in particular, improve designs. First, the mathematical methods of optimisation, on which the methods of structural design improvement are based, are presented. This includes the methods of: topology, influence functions, basis vectors, geometric splines and direct sensitivity methods. Each method is demonstrated with the solution of a sample structural improvement problem for various objectives (frequency, stress and weight reduction, for example). The practical application of the individual methods has been tested by solving three structural engineering problems sourced from the automotive engineering industry: the redesign of two different <b>front</b> suspension <b>control</b> <b>arms,</b> and the cost-reduction of an automatic brake tubing system. All three problems were solved successfully, resulting in improved designs. Each method has been evaluated with respect the practical application, popularity of the method and also any problems using the method. The solutions presented in each section were all solved using the FE design improvement software ReSHAPE from Advea Engineering Pty. Ltd...|$|R
50|$|In April 2002 for the 2003 model year, {{the chassis}} was again {{redesigned}} with hydroformed steel. The {{front and rear}} suspension were also completely overhauled. New inverted monotube shocks were now used (replacing the old twin-tube shocks {{that had been used}} since the 1960s). In the <b>front,</b> new aluminum <b>control</b> <b>arms,</b> and rack and pinion steering (replacing the recirculating ball units) have been implemented. The rear suspension was redesigned for durability in police-duty applications and the rear shocks were moved outboard of the frame rails for better handling and ease of maintenance. As a result, the road-handling manners of the Panther platform cars had improved significantly. The engine output increased due to the addition of a knock sensor for more aggressive timing. This brought up horsepower ratings to 224 HP for single-exhaust models and 239 HP for dual exhaust and police models. 2003 models also received optional seat-mounted combination head and torso side airbags. The interior was also modestly refreshed for the 2003 model year, with changes to the door panels and seats.|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} for {{controlling}} road noise transmitted through {{the suspension system}} of an automobile was developed, using a Lincoln LS automobile as the target vehicle. In this vehicle, road surface roughness generates vibrations that are transmitted into the automobile primary through a single bushing (the "point 4 bushing") {{on each of the}} <b>front</b> suspension <b>control</b> <b>arms.</b> An electromagnetic actuator was designed, built, and tested on a Lincoln LS with simulated roads noise. The actuator applies a force across the point 4 bushing, in response to accelerations of the vehicle frame, just inboard of the bushing, with the goal of reducing the net forces transmitted into the vehicle frame, which ultimately produce unwanted interior noise. Several tonal controllers were developed, each designed to operate in a narrow frequency band, and to eliminate the cross member (frame) vibration just inside the point 4 bushing. The tonal controllers were able to eliminate cross member vibration at the desired frequency. Eliminating the cross member vibration resulted in modest reductions interior sound levels. A successful vibration control system (in this vehicle) would need to eliminate cross member vibrations over frequency range 100 to 200 Hz. However, a broadband controller with this electromagnetic actuator system proved to be difficult, due to undesirable non-minimum phase dynamics. by Kristen Lynn Clements. Thesis (S. M.)

50|$|The {{suspension}} {{changes to}} the car were quite extensive; the car received shorter struts up <b>front,</b> forged track <b>control</b> <b>arms</b> and 5.5J by 13 steel wheel rims. The rear was even more radical with vertical coil spring/dampers replacing the leaf springs and two trailing arms with a A- bracket (which connected to the differential housing and brackets near the trailing arm pivots) sorting out axle location. To support this set-up, further braces were put behind the rear seat and from the rear wheelarch down to chassis in the boot. The stiffening braces meant that the spare wheel had to be moved from the standard Cortina's wheel well and was bolted {{to the left side}} of the boot floor. The battery was also relocated to the boot, behind the right wheelarch. Both of these changes made big improvements to overall weight distribution. Another improvement the Cortina Lotus gained was the new braking system (9.5 in front discs) which were built by brake specialist Girling. This system also was fitted to Cortina GTs but without a servo, which was fitted in the Cortina Lotus engine bay.|$|R
5000|$|The new Firebird shrank to a 101-inch wheelbase, losing {{more than}} 8 inches in overall length, {{measured}} {{about an inch}} narrower, and weighed nearly 500 lb less than its 1981 predecessor. It also was the most aerodynamic production Firebird to date with a drag coefficient of 0.33. The new Trans Am took things a bit further, with a coefficient of [...]32. The Trans Am body would continue to improve aerodynamically over the years, and by 1985 {{would be the most}} aerodynamic vehicle to ever be released from General Motors with a 0.29 coefficient of drag. Wind tunnels were used to form the 3rd Gen F-Body's shape, and these aerodynamic developments were fully taken advantage of by Pontiac's design team. The sleek new car had a low slung front end which featured split grilles. They fed some air to the radiator but most of the air came from an air dam underneath the front bumper. Every piece of the car was designed to reduce drag. The newly designed side view mirror housings, made of light alloy metal, were almost cone shaped, with the point facing the wind. The windshield wipers were hidden under the hood with the air intake for the climate control system. It made for a smooth flow of air over the windshield. The retractable headlamps popped up from {{the leading edge of the}} hood. The cars tended to outlive the plastic gears for the headlight doors, and since the dealers charged several hundred dollars for the repair, it was common to see Firebirds driving around with one or both headlights stuck open during the day. Smooth wheelcovers were available on the Trans Am, attached to turbine finned alloy wheels. A frameless, flush mounted, compound curved rear glass hatchback decklid provided [...] of cargo space with the rear seats folded, and an optional wiper. It provided no disturbance to the airflow over the back of the car. All of these features combined together to provide a low coefficient of drag.The front end of the vehicle featured 10.5 in power disc brakes and were now made standard on all Firebird models. Taking styling cues from the 1981 design, the new car had full width tail lights, complete with a Firebird emblem in the center. The all-new suspension design was more advanced and aggressive than anything Detroit had offered previously, easily rivaling the Corvette's handling abilities, (but not its sophistication). The front suspension utilized MacPherson struts, with inboard mounted coil springs and lower <b>front</b> <b>control</b> <b>arms.</b> In the rear, coil springs and shocks were positioned between the body and solid rear axle, with twin rear lower control arms/trailing links and a torsion bar, replacing the old-fashioned leaf springs design used previously in the 2nd Gens. A huge torque arm was mounted from the transmissions tailshaft to the rear axle center to further stabilize the axle's tendency to twist.|$|R
