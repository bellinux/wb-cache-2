5|$|Deep frying (also {{referred}} to as deep fat frying) is a cooking method in which food is submerged in hot fat, most commonly oil, rather than the shallow oil used <b>in</b> <b>conventional</b> frying, done in a frying pan. Normally, a deep fryer or chip pan is used for this; industrially, a pressure fryer or vacuum fryer may be used. Deep frying may also be performed using oil that is heated in a pot. Deep frying is classified as hot-fat cooking method. Typically, deep frying foods cook quickly: all sides of a food are cooked simultaneously as oil has {{a high rate of}} heat conduction.|$|E

40|$|Near {{isogenic}} lines (NILs) varying for reduced height (Rht) and photoperiod insensitivity (Ppd-D 1) alleles in a cv. Mercia background (rht (tall), Rht-B 1 b, Rht-D 1 b, Rht-B 1 c, Rht 8 c+Ppd-D 1 a, Rht-D 1 c, Rht 12) {{were compared}} for interception of {{photosynthetically active radiation}} (PAR), radiation use efficiency (RUE), above-ground biomass (AGB), harvest index (HI), height, weed prevalence, lodging and grain yield, at one field site but within contrasting (?organic? vs. ?conventional?) rotational and agronomic contexts, in each of 3 years. In the final year, further NILs (rht (tall), Rht-B 1 b, Rht-D 1 b, Rht-B 1 c, Rht-B 1 b+Rht-D 1 b, Rht-D 1 b+Rht-B 1 c) in Maris Huntsman and Maris Widgeon backgrounds were added together with 64 lines of a doubled haploid (DH) population [Savannah (Rht-D 1 b) ? Renesansa (Rht- 8 c+Ppd-D 1 a) ]. There were highly significant genotype ? system interactions for grain yield, mostly because differences were greater <b>in</b> the <b>conventional</b> system than <b>in</b> the organic system. Quadratic fits of NIL grain yield against height were appropriate for both systems when all NILs and years were included. Extreme dwarfing was associated with reduced PAR, RUE, AGB, HI, and increased weed prevalence. Intermediate dwarfing was often associated with improved HI <b>in</b> the <b>conventional</b> system, {{but not in the}} organic system. Heights in excess of the optimum for yield were associated particularly with reduced HI and, <b>in</b> the <b>conventional</b> system, lodging. There was no statistical evidence that optimum height for grain yield varied with system although fits peaked at 85 and 96 cm <b>in</b> the <b>conventional</b> and organic systems, respectively. Amongst the DH lines, the marker for Ppd-D 1 a was associated with earlier flowering, and just <b>in</b> the <b>conventional</b> system also with reduced PAR, AGB and grain yield. The marker for Rht-D 1 b was associated with reduced height, and again just <b>in</b> the <b>conventional</b> system, with increased HI and grain yield. The marker for Rht 8 c reduced height, and <b>in</b> the <b>conventional</b> system only, increased HI. When using the System ? DH line means as observations grain yield was associated with height and early vegetative growth in the organic system, but not <b>in</b> the <b>conventional</b> system. <b>In</b> the <b>conventional</b> system, PAR interception after anthesis correlated with yield. Savannah was the highest yielding line <b>in</b> the <b>conventional</b> system, producing significantly more grain than several lines that out yielded it in the organic system...|$|R

Its designs use the light water approach to cooling and power generation that is common <b>in</b> <b>conventional</b> nuclear plants.

As heat is transferred to steam generators, the water becomes cooler and denser, sinking back to the bottom of the device, where the cycle is repeated. Heat transferred to the steam generators is used to create steam that turns a turbine, which drives an electrical generator.|$|E

5|$|The Harrier has two control {{elements}} not found <b>in</b> <b>conventional</b> fixed-wing aircraft: the thrust vector {{and the reaction}} control system. The thrust vector refers to the slant of the four engine nozzles and can be set between 0° (horizontal, pointing directly backwards) and 98° (pointing down and slightly forwards). The 90° vector is normally deployed for VTOL manoeuvring. The reaction control is achieved by manipulating the control stick and is similar in action to the cyclic control of a helicopter. While irrelevant during forward flight mode, these controls are essential during VTOL and STOL manoeuvres.|$|E

5|$|As a self-taught {{composer}} and performer, Zappa's diverse musical influences {{led him to}} create music that was sometimes difficult to categorize.

5|$|NuScale is {{expected}} to be the first SMR to market, because its cooling is similar to the systems used <b>in</b> <b>conventional</b> power plants. However, alternative cooling systems using molten metals are expected to operate at higher, more efficient temperatures once approved. The company estimates a twelve-unit NuScale plant would cost $5,000 per kilowatt. In comparison, the Energy Information Administration in 2011 estimated costs to be $4,700 per kilowatt for conventional nuclear power, $4,600 for a carbon sequestration coal plant and $931 at a gas-fired plant or in excess of $1,800 for a gas-fired plant with carbon sequestration. David Mohre, executive director of NRECA's Energy and Power Division, said SMR's like NuScale's are ideal for rural towns that need small power plants and do not have access to natural gas. NuScale power plants are also expected to take less time, materials and space to construct than other power sources and can be expanded incrementally to meet changing power needs.|$|E
