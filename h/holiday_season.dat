5|$|The {{story of}} Christmas Nights follows Elliot and Claris during the <b>holiday</b> <b>season</b> {{following}} their adventures with Nights. Though they both enjoy the Christmas season, they {{feel as if}} something is missing. Realising that the Christmas Star that usually sits {{at the top of}} the Twin Seeds Christmas tree is absent, the pair travel to Nightopia to find it. There, they reunite with Nights and re-explore Spring Valley, which has now been decorated due to their dreams of the <b>holiday</b> <b>season.</b> The remainder of the story revolves around their attempts of defeating a revived Gillwing and retrieving the Christmas Star from his lair.|$|E

5|$|According to Baer, {{after the}} initial <b>holiday</b> <b>season</b> Magnavox {{considered}} dropping the console, but the modest continuing demand the following year convinced them to manufacture an additional 27,000 units for the 1973 <b>holiday</b> <b>season,</b> selling 20,000 of them. The console was also released in 12 other countries: Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, the Soviet Union, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Venezuela, with different games. The international release was focused in the United Kingdom, with some non-English versions not released until 1974. Late in 1973, Magnavox ran a large advertising campaign for all of their 1974 products, with the result being that they sold 129,000 Odyssey units in 1974, or 150,000 according to Baer. Magnavox discontinued the console after 1975; according to Baer it sold 350,000 units in total worldwide, though statements by Fritsche indicate {{it may have been}} higher. The light gun peripheral sold 20,000 units. As the Odyssey was discontinued Magnavox released the first successive dedicated consoles—consoles that could only play games built into the system—in the Magnavox Odyssey series, the Odyssey 100 and Odyssey 200, as part of the first generation of video game consoles; the Odyssey 100 was only capable of playing the ping pong and hockey games from the original Odyssey. Eleven dedicated Odyssey consoles were produced before a true follow-up console in 1978, the Magnavox Odyssey².|$|E

The driver, 74-year-old Ernest Brown, was trapped in the cab and suffered pelvic injuries, while a number of passengers suffered minor injuries. Although the station was repaired and services were resumed, Pleasurama decided to close the line {{at the end of the}} 1965 <b>holiday</b> <b>season.</b> Services stopped on 26September 1965.|$|E

5|$|Doom 3 {{was also}} {{intended}} to be more storyline focused than previous id titles, as was demonstrated by the developers' conscious effort to have more professional voice acting. Late in 2002, two employees at ATI Technologies leaked a development version of Doom 3 onto the Internet. One year later, a new trailer was shown at E3 2003 and soon afterwards id Software's website was updated to showcase Doom 3 as an upcoming project, although it was also announced that Doom 3 would not {{be ready for the}} 2003 <b>holiday</b> <b>season.</b> According to John Carmack, the development took longer than expected.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, {{businessmen}} in the Washington, D.C. area became involved and greatly expanded {{the program with}} the Christmas Pageant of Peace. The Pageant centered around the lighting of the Christmas tree, and included various elements such as a life-sized reproduction of the nativity scene. Every year from 1954 to 1972, a tree was cut and brought to the White House from a different US state and installed at the Ellipse. The ceremony of the tree lighting was then followed by Christmas presentations through the <b>holiday</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E
5|$|In January 2007, {{the church}} and its {{surroundings}} were used as locations in the filming of an episode of EastEnders, broadcast in the United Kingdom over the Easter 2007 <b>holiday</b> <b>season.</b> The production crew added mock gravestones and a temporary Victorian-style street lamp to the churchyard.

The gross {{domestic}} product for Jamaica, which had been suffering from a substantially slow economic growth rate, further declined following the extensive damage. The agriculture sector sustained slight losses from reduced egg production due to the storm's traumatizing effects on farm chickens, and {{in the face of}} high repair costs the island saw below-standard levels of <b>holiday</b> <b>season</b> consumption.|$|E
5|$|Many {{writers in}} the early 20th century perpetuated a myth that Thespis ran only a month and was {{considered}} a failure. In fact, it remained open until 8 March. Of the nine London pantomimes that appeared during the 1871–72 <b>holiday</b> <b>season,</b> five closed before Thespis did. By its nature, the genre did not lend itself to long runs, and all nine had closed {{by the end of}} March. Moreover, the Gaiety normally only ran productions for two or three weeks; the run of Thespis was extraordinary for the theatre.|$|E
5|$|The Mint {{arranged}} to outsource {{part of the}} coin-making process, and pledged to flood the nation with coins by 1965. Despite an increased need for coins in an improving economy, merchants made it past the 1964 <b>holiday</b> <b>season</b> without severe shortages, though the half dollar had stopped circulating. Most Fed facilities reported sufficient supplies of cents and nickels, with some still short on dimes and quarters, and shortages of half dollars everywhere—one Fed official wrote that his branch had not seen a half dollar deposited by a bank in eight months.|$|E

Beginning in 2001, the shows were moved ahead of the Christmas <b>holiday</b> <b>season.</b> Also in 2001, the show made its {{network television}} broadcast on ABC, though in all subsequent years, it has been broadcast on CBS. The show has been held {{at a variety of}} locations in different cities including Miami, Los Angeles, Cannes, Paris, and London. The first four shows were held at the Plaza Hotel in New York City, but since it has become a televised event it has most often been held at the 69th Regiment Armory in New York City.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Rivens development, {{publisher}} Brøderbund was facing falling revenues as development costs rose. Two years into the project, Cyan still had nothing they could show them. Brøderbund's stock dropped from $60 a share to $22 in 1996, because of a delay in the publishing of Riven. The plan had been to ship the game {{in time for the}} 1996 holiday season; Riven was finally published on October 29, 1997. Even though Rivens sales were expected to be higher than any other game that <b>holiday</b> <b>season,</b> Brøderbund launched a $10million marketing campaign and developed a retail marketing partnership with Toshiba America. Anticipation for the game was high even among non-gamers, helped by web-based word of mouth and well-placed media coverage.|$|E
5|$|Due to Caroline’s compact size, {{sustained}} winds only reached 48mph (78km/h) in Brownsville, Texas. The storm also dropped {{heavy rain}} the southern {{portion of the}} state, as much as 11.93in (302mm) in Port Isabel. In Brownsville, Caroline broke a record for most rainfall within a 24-hour period {{during the month of}} August. The rainfall caused minor flooding. This helped end a prolonged drought in the Rio Grande Valley. It canceled most of the Labor Day <b>holiday</b> <b>season</b> for South Padre Island, one of the busiest weekends for tourism on the island. Caroline also produced storm tides 1–4feet (0.3-1.2m) above normal along coastal sections of southern Texas. Overall damage in southern Texas was minor, and there were two indirect fatalities due to drowning incidents in Galveston.|$|E
