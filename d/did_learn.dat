5|$|Kleine was a philologist, his lessons {{not held}} in {{contemporary}} language, {{and it is}} not known for certain all subjects Busch and his friend were taught. Busch <b>did</b> <b>learn</b> elementary arithmetic from his uncle, although science lessons might have been more comprehensive, as Kleine, like many other clergymen, was a beekeeper, and published essays and textbooks on the subject— Busch demonstrated his knowledge of bee-keeping in his future stories. Drawing, and German and English poetry, were also taught by Kleine.|$|E

25|$|He had {{a distant}} {{relationship}} with his youngest brother, but a close one with Manfred. Unlike most Prussian nobles Wolfram von Richthofen went to the local Gymnasium (academic high school) {{and did not have}} private tutors at home. He attended school in Striegau. His grades in mathematics and German language were good, but he did not excel at foreign languages (in which he scored average to poor results). He found studying language to be boring, but <b>did</b> <b>learn</b> Italian and could converse competently in it in later life.|$|E

With this destroyed, the connections between the two were also broken, and Harry never again felt pain in his scar. Rowling revealed Harry has also {{lost the ability to}} speak Parseltongue, though he regained the ability to understand it in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child after his scar began to hurt again following the rise of Voldemort and Bellatrix's daughter Delphi whom Harry, his son Albus Severus, and his allies defeated and sent to Azkaban. In the epilogue of the film, the scar has faded to an ordinary looking scar on Harry's forehead.|$|E
25|$|In 1934, Wood was {{the third}} fastest runner in Taylor County and was scouted by coach Leslie “Fats” Cranfill from Hardin-Simmons University, who offered Wood a partial {{athletic}} scholarship to Hardin-Simmons. After some convincing, Wood's father gave him his blessing and set his son up living with a friend in Abilene. Eventually, Wood earned a full scholarship, and the University provided him with room and board. At Hardin-Simmons, Wood played football and basketball, ran track, and boxed {{in order to maintain}} his scholarship. Despite nearly flunking out his first semester, Wood did well in college. He was never a star athlete at the university, but he <b>did</b> <b>learn</b> a lot about sports and coaching. It was at Hardin-Simmons that Wood decided {{he wanted to be a}} coach.|$|E

Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically.

It was ages before I felt ready to perform my own songs in front of other people." [...] She also credits Parish for teaching her how to perform in front of audiences, saying [...] "after the experience with John's band and seeing him perform I found it was enormously helpful to me as a performer to engage with people in the audience, and I probably <b>did</b> <b>learn</b> that from him, amongst other things." ...|$|E

He had made the allegation a number of times in public and media appearances in 2006 and 2007. The book also described a conversation Clark had with Paul Wolfowitz in May 1991 after the Gulf War, quoting Wolfowitz as lamenting the non-removal of Saddam Hussein, but also telling him that [...] "...we <b>did</b> <b>learn</b> one thing that’s very important. With the end of the Cold War, we can now use our military with impunity. The Soviets won’t come in to block us. And we’ve got five, maybe 10, years to clean up these old Soviet surrogate regimes like Iraq and Syria before the next superpower emerges to challenge us...".|$|E
500|$|As Ripken's playing career wound down, his {{coaching}} career began. His first experience as manager came in 1961, when he succeeded Billy DeMars (who had been promoted) as Leesburg's manager in June. Leesburg folded after the 1961 season. In 1963, {{at the age}} of 27, he became a full-time manager with Fox Cities. From 1963 through 1974, he managed Fox Cities, Abderdeen (1963–64,66), the Tri-City Atoms (1965), the Miami Marlins (1967), the Elmira Pioneers (1968), Rochester (1969–70), the Dallas-Fort Worth Spurs (1971), and the Asheville Orioles (1972–74). As a manager in the minor leagues, Ripken oversaw the development of Jim Palmer, Eddie Murray, and Rich Dauer, among other Orioles. In addition to normal coaching duties, he would also at times be responsible for driving the team bus, or even fixing it. During 1969–70, managing a Triple-A team, he would conduct baseball clinics for the Red Wings players. Cal Jr. would always listen to these; he found them [...] "boring" [...] but <b>did</b> <b>learn</b> some useful baseball skills in them. Although Ripken always considered Aberdeen, Maryland, his home during this period, he and his family lived all over the country as he moved from city to city. In 1975, Ripken served as a scout for the Orioles.|$|E

In an interview that was published in spring 2002, he said, [...] "I <b>did</b> <b>learn</b> an awful lot during those years, and then went on in the 60s writing occasional articles about specific artists and their specific strategies.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a formalism for considering {{the issues of}} learning in design. A foundation for machine learning in design (MLinD) is defined so as to provide answers to basic questions on learning in design, such as, "What types of knowledge can be learnt?", "How <b>does</b> <b>learning</b> occur?", and "When <b>does</b> <b>learning</b> occur?". Five main elements of MLinD are presented as the input knowledge, knowledge transformers, output knowledge, goals/reasons for learning, and learning triggers. Using this foundation, published systems in MLinD were reviewed. The systematic review {{presents a}} basis for validating the presented foundation. The paper concludes that there is considerable work {{to be carried out}} in order to fully formalize the foundation of MLinD...|$|R

2500|$|The Waffle {{was also}} the {{progenitor}} of the NDP Socialist Caucus and the New Politics Initiative (NPI). The NPI were seen as {{a major force in}} the federal NDP during the period after the 2000 federal election. [...] Like the Waffle, they too wanted the party to move left, and were aiming to do this by closing down the NDP and forming a new party. The NPI's attempts at reforming the party were crushed, similar to the Waffle, at the 2001 Winnipeg convention. However, it seems that the party <b>did</b> <b>learn</b> a lesson from how it dealt with the Waffle, because there {{was not the kind of}} acrimony that occurred after the 1971 federal leadership convention. Unlike the Waffle, the NPI was not seen as a party within the party, and the establishment did not try to disband it. Many of the NPI supporters ended up in Jack Layton's 2003 leadership campaign, though they were outnumbered by the forces that opposed the NPI, such as NDProgress, which was a moderate reform group comparable to the Waffle's old foe NDPNow. [...] After he won the leadership, Layton was able to unite the many factions within the party, and that facilitated the NPI choosing to dissolve itself in 2004, again without any of the same bitterness that infused the Waffle's dissolution.|$|E
