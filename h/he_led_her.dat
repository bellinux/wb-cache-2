After being promoted to captain on 31 December 1914, {{he became an}} Additional Naval Assistant to the First Sea Lord before being given command of the battleship HMS Colossus in May 1915. <b>He</b> <b>led</b> <b>her</b> at the Battle of Jutland with notable success, contributing to {{the sinking of the}} German cruiser Wiesbaden.

25|$|The early {{light was}} {{obscured}} {{by a black}} cloud through which shone flashes, which Pliny likens to sheet lightning, but more extensive. The cloud obscured Point Misenum near at hand and the island of Capraia (Capri) across the bay. Fearing for their lives the population began to call {{to each other and}} move back from the coast along the road. Pliny's mother requested him to abandon her and save his own life, as she was too corpulent and aged to go further, but seizing her hand <b>he</b> <b>led</b> <b>her</b> away as best he could. A rain of ash fell. Pliny found it necessary to shake off the ash periodically to avoid being buried. Later that same day the ash stopped falling and the sun shone weakly through the cloud, encouraging Pliny and his mother to return to their home and wait for news of Pliny the Elder. The letter compares the ash to a blanket of snow. Evidently the earthquake and tsunami damage at that location were not severe enough to prevent continued use of the home.|$|E
500|$|At {{approximately}} 12 {{midnight on}} 21 September 1986, Wood {{went to the}} playroom in the mansion and killed his mistress Danielle Ledez by shooting her once in the head. [...] Ledez was 10 weeks pregnant by Wood. [...] Wood then proceeded to play hide-and-seek with Ledez's daughter Stephanie (aged 3), after which <b>he</b> <b>led</b> <b>her</b> into Christopher's bedroom and shot her twice in the head, killing her instantly. He then took Ledez's son Christopher (aged 5) {{into the bathroom and}} told him to close his eyes as he had a surprise for him, then shot him twice in the head. Wood then bludgeoned the boy with a large ruler four or five times {{in the back of the}} head.|$|E

2500|$|The gandharva Kali was in {{love with}} Varuthini and had been {{rejected}} by her in the past. He saw how she hungered for the Brahmin, so he took on the appearance of Pravara and came before the courtesan. <b>He</b> <b>led</b> <b>her</b> into the bedchamber and told her to close her eyes during their sex [...] [...] As they made love, Varuthini noticed that his body became flaming hot and believed it was because his Brahmin spirit was infused with the sacrificial fire. After climax, Kali, still-as-Pravara, left the apsara and returned to his abode. Varuthini soon became pregnant and nine months later gave birth to a human child that not only looked like the Brahmin but possessed his soul as well. The authors of the book Science in Culture comment this was an example of the Sanskrit phrase [...] "from his semen and from her thinking," [...] meaning the child was indeed Pravara's child because she believed it was his.|$|E
2500|$|It {{emerged during}} the trial that Nelson's sister Laura Anne had been shown Zoe's body by Bayne {{on the morning after}} her murder, but had kept this {{information}} from the police for five days. Laura Anne, who gave her evidence from behind a screen to prevent her from seeing Bayne, did not relay the information until she made her third statement to the police on 28 May, the day of Bayne's arrest. Laura Anne said that she had gone to Bayne's address on the morning after Nelson disappeared in order to return some articles of clothing to him. When she arrived she said he appeared [...] "jumpy" [...] and was drinking vodka. Shortly after that, the two had left the house and Bayne told her he had [...] "something to show her". She said that <b>he</b> <b>led</b> <b>her</b> to the area where he had killed Nelson and pointed out the blackened body. She said she knew it was her sister because she recognised a Rangers F.C. tattoo on her arm. In her statement she said: [...] "At Monkey Hill Rab said to me 'I hit her with my hands. She tried to hit me back.' Rab also said 'I burned her with petrol.'" [...] She testified in court that she had kept silent because she was terrified of Bayne, although Neil Murray QC, for the defence, produced other police statements in court in which she denied she had been threatened, admitted she had been out with Bayne on the day after the body was discovered, and had also subsequently visited Bayne and spent some time in his bedroom listening to music. She also spent about an hour on the telephone to him. A friend also [...] "described her as happy and normal" [...] during the period of silence. When asked why she hadn't told the police when she was first interviewed, she said: [...] "I did not tell them about this because I was scared my mum would not believe me and think it was me who killed Zoe." [...] Bayne's grandmother testified that on the day the body was discovered, Laura Anne did not visit and he did not leave the house except to go with her to a local supermarket.|$|E

60|$|The Indians {{glanced at}} the little figure, then out into the flaming thickets. Each savage sprang behind a tree with {{incredible}} quickness. Legget saw this, and grasping Helen, <b>he</b> quickly <b>led</b> <b>her</b> within cover of the chestnut.|$|R
60|$|He {{drove down}} town to a board stable, {{and took her}} through to a large, roofed {{inclosure}} in the rear. There <b>he</b> <b>led</b> to <b>her</b> a span of sturdy dappled chestnuts, with cream-colored manes and tails.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> {{would have}} <b>led</b> <b>her</b> away, but Macheson {{was not to}} be shaken off. He kept his place by the girl's side.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>led</b> <b>her</b> silently to her place, {{and left}} her with a {{profound}} bow.|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>led</b> <b>her</b> away, {{and they}} passed down the room. John slowly resumed his seat.|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked at}} her, a little startled. What instinct, <b>he</b> wondered, had <b>led</b> <b>her</b> to place her finger upon the one poison spot in his thoughts? ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{went out}} of the room, and {{returned}} in a minute leading Katarina. [...] "Sir Guy has a question to ask you, daughter," [...] he said; [...] "I pray you to answer him frankly." [...] <b>He</b> then <b>led</b> <b>her</b> to a seat, placed her there and left the room.|$|R
60|$|Marian half smiled; it was {{pleasant}} to find that, towards her at least, the boys' intention had {{been anything but}} unkind, but still she hardly knew how to be placable with Lionel when <b>he</b> had <b>led</b> <b>her</b> brother into mischief, and then left him to bear all the blame.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>led</b> <b>her</b> away, {{wondering}} greatly, {{and thinking}} how very good- natured Cousin Rotherwood was.|$|E

60|$|Maude {{had often}} driven alone with Frank before, {{but now she}} felt {{suddenly}} constrained and shy. The marriage-service, with all its half-understood allusions and exhortations, had depressed and frightened her. She hardly dared to glance at her husband. But <b>he</b> soon <b>led</b> <b>her</b> out of her graver humour.|$|R
50|$|The {{first name}} {{turn out to}} be dead ends, but the second leads to the address of a pair of newly-weds.

50|$|During the Human Error 2-parter, Sari {{attempted}} {{to get the}} Dinobots' aid only to have a not so warm welcome.

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>led</b> <b>her</b> into a {{chaos of}} stoves, grates, and pipes {{at the back}} of the store.|$|E

6000|$|She listened at her own. The {{house was}} quiet, {{and all the}} lights were out. It was a long, long time, she thought, since she used to make her nightly pilgrimages to his door!

60|$|She let {{him have}} his way and <b>he</b> soon <b>led</b> <b>her</b> back to the {{beautiful}} garden where she had spent {{part of the day}} before. Here she ate some fruit, drank some water of the fountain, and felt as if she had made an excellent meal. She walked about amongst the flowers, played with her little dog, and at night returned to sleep in the cave.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. I {{have been}} to Switzerland. I have seen the curÃ©--a good man. He has told me {{all there is to}} tell. I found him at the hospice, busy with his oeuvre de bienfaisance. <b>He</b> <b>led</b> me to <b>her</b> grave." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{with an air}} of mastery, as {{significant}} as it was unconscious <b>he</b> <b>led</b> <b>her</b> to her room.|$|E

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>led</b> <b>her</b> {{out of the}} apartment, and up {{the broad}} staircase. Outside {{the door of the}} Count's sitting-room he paused.|$|E
50|$|On June 6, 1989, Miyazaki {{convinced}} five-year-old Ayako Nomoto {{to allow}} him to take pictures of <b>her.</b> <b>He</b> then <b>led</b> <b>her</b> into his car and murdered her.

60|$|She leaned hack in {{the corner}} of the sofa to which <b>he</b> had <b>led</b> <b>her,</b> her eyes dry now but still very soft and sweet.

He raised her fingers to his lips without any protest from her. She looked at him with a little smile.|$|R
