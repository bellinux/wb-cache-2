40|$|Strong tidal {{currents}} {{crossing over}} the abrupt topography of the Aleutian Passes result in regions with high <b>horizontal</b> <b>property</b> gradients. These frontal regions {{vary with the}} tidal cycle and form the boundary between vertically mixed and stratified regions. Concentrations of seabirds were associated with convergence zones in the mixed water (MW) and with the front between North Pacific (NP) water and MW. Species that were foraging by picking at prey from the surface were associated with surface convergences {{that appeared to be}} associated with Langmuir circulation cells or tidal features (all fulmar aggregations) in the central passes (Samalga, Seguam). In contrast, sub-surface foraging puffins and small alcids were mostly observed in areas of turbulent, well-mixed water near the shallow regions of the passes. Short-tailed shearwater flocks that were plunge-diving for prey were associated with the front between the NP water and MW in the passes. On our transects, we observed no significant aggregations of seabirds associated with Bering Sea water or NP water away from the frontal zones. The interaction of strong currents with bathymetric features results in zones of vertical advection, mixing, and surface convergences that make island passes attractive foraging regions for seabirds. Deep passes lacking these features, such as many of the passes in the western Aleutian Archipelago, are not as likely to facilitate trophic transfer to top predators as shallow passes, such as those found in the eastern Aleutian Islands. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three separate investigations of plankton models at different scales. In the first investigation the master equation for an individual-based model with pair interactions is formulated. Special cases of the master equation are used to explain the differences in behavior of the individual- based model and its mean-field approximation. In the second investigation constraints on the biomass and productivity of a continuum model for plankton are found using the large-scale properties of the model. The third investigation quantifies the hypothesis that thin layers of plankton and other passive tracers are created by vertically-sheared horizontal currents acting on <b>horizontal</b> <b>property</b> gradients. Chapter II contains {{the development of a}} master equation for a spatial population model for reproducing and interacting individuals. Additionally, Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the mean-field approximation to the individual-based model can grossly under- or over-estimate the population of the individual-based model, depending on the ratio of diffusive to reproductive time scales and the ratio of the growth rate to the interaction strength. The failure of the mean-field model is explained by applying the master equation to the special cases of no interactions and infinite-range interactions between individuals. Chapter III describes a continuum model for plankton growing, diffusing, and being stirred in an inhomogeneous environment. Bounds on the biomass and productivity are developed which allow the estimation of the plankton abundance without knowing the details of the flow or the spatially (and temporally) varying growth rate. Furthermore, a constrain is found that may forbid extinction, even when the average growth rate is negative. Chapter IV examines the situation of an initial patch of a passive tracer (such as plankton) being sheared into a thin vertical layer by a vertically-sheared horizontal current. The importance of initial conditions is emphasized and the time to minimum layer thickness, minimum layer thickness, layer intensity, and layer lifetime are all estimated. For oceanic parameters layers approximately 1 m thick are found to form in about 1 day and have a lifetime of the same order of the formation tim...|$|E

40|$|On {{the eve of}} the {{financial}} crisis, the USA was inhabited by almost 70 percent homeowning households, in comparison to about 45 percent in Germany. Homeownership, Renting and Society presents new evidence showing that this homeownership gap already existed between American and German cities around 1900. Existing explanations based on culture, government housing policy or typical socio-economic factors have difficulties in accounting for these long-term cross-country differences. Using historical case studies on Germany and the USA, the book identifies three institutional domains on the supply-side of the housing market – urban land, housing finance and construction – that set countries on different housing trajectories and subsequently established differences that were hard to reverse in later periods. Further chapters generalize the argument across other OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries and extend the explanation to cover historical differences in homeownership ideology and <b>horizontal</b> <b>property</b> institutions. This enlightening volume also puts forward path-dependence theories in housing studies, connects housing with vast urban-history and political-economy literature and offers comprehensive insights about the case of a tenant’s country which contradicts the tendency towards universal homeownership. Providing an all-new historic-institutionalist explanation of the German–American homeownership gap, this title will be of interest to postgraduate students and scholars interested in fields including: Housing Studies, Sociology, Urban History, Political Economy, Social Policy and Geography. It may also be of interest to those working in housing field organizations and ministries.

40|$|Continental glaciers covered {{as much as}} {{thirty percent}} of the present-day {{inhabited}} earth during the Quaternary period. Traditionally, one-dimensional consolidation has been considered as the main process of formation for the soils deposited during glaciation. One of the outcomes of accepting one-dimensional consolidation as the main process of formation is that the geomechanical properties of soil in a horizontal plane are isotropic (known as cross-anisotropy). Recent measurements of subglacial pore pressure and preconsolidation pressure profile have indicated that {{this might not be}} the case. The role of subglacial shear action has probably been long neglected. The main objective of this research is to investigate the effects of subglacial shearing on the geomechanical properties of glaciated soils. Recent research has found evidence of <b>horizontal</b> <b>property</b> anisotropy associated with the direction of the ice-sheet movement. A testing program was thus proposed to explore the relationship between the anisotropy of property and the direction of past glacier movement. The program involves several fundamental engineering parameters of soils. These parameters together with the corresponding test methods are as follows: (i) Conventional oedometer test – yield stress anisotropy; (ii) Oedometer test with lateral stress measurement – stiffness anisotropy; (iii) Load cell pressuremeter (LCPM) test – in situ stress anisotropy. The physical meaning of yield stress determined by conventional oedometer tests was interpreted as the critical state of structural collapse. The literature review and an experimental study on kaolin samples with a known stress history suggested that yield stress possesses certain dependency on the sampling direction. The anisotropy of yield stress for Battleford till from Birsay, Saskatchewan was also explored by testing directional oedometer samples. In addition, the anisotropy of stiffness was also investigated using a newly developed lateral stress oedometer that is capable of independent measurement of horizontal stresses at three different points with angles of 120 degrees. Preliminary evidence of a correlation between the direction of maximum stiffness in a horizontal plane and the known direction of glacial shear was observed. The correlation between the direction of maximum yield stress and known direction of glaciation was rather poor. Anisotropy of in situ stresses was investigated by conducting LCPM tests in Pot clay in the Netherlands. Based on the LCPM test results, it was concluded that the evidence of a correlation between the anisotropy of in situ stress and known direction of glacial advance is still rather obscure. Although both the laboratory studies and field studies cannot sufficiently confirm the existence of lateral anisotropy of geomechanical properties and its relationship to the direction of the Quaternary ice-sheet movement, the effects of subglacial shearing should not be neglected in assessing the geotechnical properties of glaciated soils. In practice, it is usually found that the preconsolidation pressure profile does not follow the gravitational line as predicted by the one-dimensional consolidation theory and its magnitude is not compatible with the measured effective pressure values {{at the base of the}} glacier. It has been suggested that changes in seepage gradient (upward or downward) are responsible for the deviation of preconsolidation pressure profile away from the gravitational line. In this thesis, a new glacial process model – consolidation coupled shearing – was proposed. This model is based on the framework of traditional soil mechanics (critical state theory, Modified Cam-clay model and one-dimensional consolidation theory) and is consistent with the general geological and glaciological evidences. This model may provide an alternative explanation for the preconsolidation pressure patterns generally observed in practice. It can also be combined with groundwater flow characteristics to explain the diversity of the preconsolidation consolidation patterns. The proposed model was used successfully to obtain the preconsolidation pressure profile observed in Battleford till at Birsay and the subglacial shear-softening phenomenon...|$|E
