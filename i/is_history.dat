And that's when we first hear her at the microphone singing, and the rest <b>is</b> <b>history.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1961 the British {{historian}} Edward Hallett Carr {{published his}} What <b>is</b> <b>History?,</b> which became well known. Therein Carr conjectured {{that the very}} nature of writing history will cause historians as a whole to reveal themselves to their readers as 'prisoners' subject to the context of their own age and culture. As a consequence, one may add, every generation feels the need to rewrite history so that it better fits their own situation, their point of view. To illustrate his point here, Carr selected as exemplars a number of well-regarded historians, among them being Theodore Mommsen.|$|E

25|$|In Bengal, some Muslims {{refer to}} the social {{stratification}} within their society as qaum (or Quoms), a term that is found among Muslims elsewhere in India, {{as well as in}} Pakistan and Afghanistan. Qaums have patrilineal hereditary, with ranked occupations and endogamy. Membership in a qaum is inherited by birth. Barth identifies the origin of the stratification from the historical segregation between pak (pure) and paleed (impure) - - defined by the family's social or religious status, occupation and involvement in sexual crimes. Originally, Paleed/Paleet qaum included people running or working at brothels, prostitution service providers or professional courtesan/dancers (Tawaif) and musicians. There <b>is</b> <b>history</b> of skin color defining Pak/Paleed, but that does not have historical roots, and was adopted by outsiders using analogy from Hindu Caste system.|$|E

500|$|However, the {{response}} was not exclusively positive. In The Independent on Sunday, columnist Lucy Ellmann criticised both what she saw as the unchanging nature of the characters and Flannery's concentration on friendship rather than family. [...] "What's in the water there anyway? These are the youngest grandparents ever seen! Nothing has changed about them since 1964 except a few grey hairs... It's quite impressive that anything emotional could be salvaged from this nine-part hop, skip and jump through the years. In fact we still hardly know these people – zooming from one decade to the next has a distancing effect," [...] she wrote of the former point. And of the latter, [...] "Peter Flannery {{seems to want to}} suggest that friendships are the only cure for a life blighted by deficient parents. But all that links this ill-matched foursome in the end <b>is</b> <b>history</b> and sentimentality. The emotional centre of the writing is still in family ties." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to her legal work, Murray wrote two volumes of autobiography {{and a collection of}} poetry. Her first autobiographical book, Proud Shoes (1956), traces her family's complicated racial origins, particularly focusing on her maternal grandparents, Robert and Cornelia Fitzgerald. Cornelia was the daughter of a slave who had been raped by her owner and his brother; she was raised by her owner's sister and educated. Robert was a free black man from Pennsylvania, also of mixed racial ancestry; he moved to the South to teach during the Reconstruction Era. Newspapers, including The New York Times, gave the book very positive reviews. The New York Herald Tribune stated that Proud Shoes is [...] "a personal memoir, it <b>is</b> <b>history,</b> it is biography, and it is also a story that, at its best, is dramatic enough to satisfy the demands of fiction. It is written in anger, but without hatred; in affection, but without pathos and tears; and in humor that never becomes extravagant".|$|E

2500|$|Montgomery's apologetic {{work has}} {{generally}} centred on establishing the divinity of Christ by assessing {{the historical and}} legal evidences for the resurrection. Much of this work has influenced popular apologists like Josh McDowell, Don Stewart, Francis J.

2500|$|Rosenfeld criticized Richard Cohen {{for writing}} in a Washington Post column that [...] "The {{greatest}} mistake Israel could make {{at the moment is}} to forget that Israel itself is a mistake....

2500|$|Another {{relationship}} {{factor that}} affects forgiveness <b>is</b> <b>history</b> of past conflict. [...] If past conflicts ended badly (i.e., reconciliation/forgiveness was either not achieved or achieved after much conflict), partners {{will be less}} prone to seek out or offer forgiveness. [...] As noted earlier, maintaining a balanced relationship (i.e. no partner over/under benefitted) has {{a positive effect on}} relationship quality and tendency to forgive. [...] In that same vein, partners are more likely to offer forgiveness if their partners had recently forgiven them for a transgression. [...] However, if a transgression is repeated resentment begins to build which has an adverse effect on the offended partner’s desire to offer forgiveness.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is hardly}} {{necessary}} to dwell {{here on the}} value and significance of these lives. [...] We may regard them as religious romances or novels, and as is generally agreed, they were written to enhance {{the cause of the}} church or parochia, whose freedom and independence was not infrequently threatened at this time. In no sense are they 'historical'; indeed they have more to offer the student of social anthropology and primitive religion.

2500|$|The {{landscape}} Casino Sunrise is Denomie's own {{remake of}} the Seal of Minnesota. Governor Tim Pawlenty is represented by [...] "Pawl Bunyan" [...] (a play on Paul Bunyan) and is shown with his pants around his ankles standing directly behind Babe the Blue Ox. Former governor Jessie Ventura is shown only wearing a thong and a feather boa; he has a cigar in his mouth, a fishing rod set with a grenade in one hand, and a fist {{of money in the}} other. No politician of recent Minnesota history escapes the wrath of Denomie's paintbrush; Norm Coleman sits on a toilet and Al Franken counts ballots behind him. Indian Country is represented as well through images of lynched Indians from Fort Snelling, an Indian funeral pyre, a Christian church, a member of the American Indian Movement riding a horse and more. A Minneapolis police car relating to arrests made of three Indian men and without enough room for them all in the car one was placed in the trunk, is also depicted. Of this painting Denomie said, [...] "The Minnesota State seal needed to be updated. It's been a while...This is all history, all of it <b>is</b> <b>history</b> of Minnesota." ...|$|E
