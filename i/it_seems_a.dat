5|$|Adolphus Woodford {{was born}} on 9 July 1821. His father was already a {{distinguished}} soldier, and as eldest son he was named for the Colonel-in-Chief of his father's regiment, the Coldstream Guards. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> natural progression for Adolphus to have become {{an officer in the}} same regiment. He was gazetted as a lieutenant on 25 December 1838, but resigned on 23 April 1841. His father was, by this time, Governor-general of Gibraltar, and it was there, on 9 February 1842, that Adolphus was initiated into his father's lodge, the Lodge of Friendship No 345 (now the Royal Lodge of Friendship No 278). He took the customary three degrees of Entered Apprentice, Fellowcraft and Master Mason, and is known to have attended nine meetings of the lodge in total, before returning to England in the autumn, matriculating at the University of Durham to study Theology.|$|E

25|$|White {{decided not}} to accept any more prizes for his work, and he {{declined}} both the $10,000 Britannia Award and another Miles Franklin Award. White was approached by Harry M. Miller {{to work on a}} screenplay for Voss but nothing came of it. He became an active opponent of literary censorship and joined a number of other public figures in signing a statement of defiance against Australia’s decision to participate in the Vietnam War. His name had sometimes been mentioned as a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature, but in 1971, after losing to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, he wrote to a friend: That Nobel Prize! I hope I never hear it mentioned again. I certainly don't want it; the machinery behind <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> bit dirty, when we thought that only applied to Australian awards. In my case to win the prize would upset my life far too much, and it would embarrass me to be held up to the world as an Australian writer when, apart from the accident of blood, I feel I am temperamentally a cosmopolitan Londoner.|$|E
25|$|Salvian {{continued}} his friendly intercourse with both father and sons {{long after the}} latter had left his care; it was to Salonius (then a bishop) that he wrote his explanatory letter just {{after the publication of}} his treatise Ad ecclesiam; and to the same prelate a few years later he dedicated his great work, the De gubernatione Dei ("The Government of God"). If French scholars are right in assigning Hilary's Vita Honorati to 430, Salvian, who is there called a priest, had probably already left Lyons for Marseilles, where he is known to have spent the last years of his life (Gennadius, ap. Migne, lviii. 1099). It was probably from Marseilles that he wrote his first letter — presumably to Lerins — begging the community there to receive his kinsman, the son of a widow of Cologne, who had been reduced to poverty by the barbarian invasions. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> fair inference that Salvian had divested himself of all his property in favour of that society and sent his relative to Lerins for assistance (Ep. i., with which compare Ad eccles. ii. 9, 10; iii. 5). It has been conjectured that Salvian paid a visit to Carthage; but this is a mere inference based on the minute details he gives of the state of this city just before its fall to the Vandals (De gub. vii. viii). He seems to have been still living at Marseilles when Gennadius wrote under the papacy of Gelasius (492-496).|$|E

500|$|Rolling Stone {{describes}} Swift as [...] "a songwriting savant with {{an intuitive}} gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture". According to The Village Voice, she uses third-verse {{point of view}} reversals frequently. In terms of imagery, repetition is evident in Swift's songwriting. In The Guardians words, [...] "she spends so much time kissin' in the rain that <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> miracle she hasn't developed trenchfoot". Slant Magazine adds, [...] "to Swift's credit, she explores new lyrical motifs {{over the course of}} [...] album". Although reviews of Swift's work are [...] "almost uniformly positive", The New Yorker has said she is generally portrayed [...] "more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary".|$|E
500|$|The 19th century saw a major {{expansion}} of soap manufacturing in Nablus, {{which became the}} center of soap production throughout the Fertile Crescent. By 1907, the city's 30 factories were producing nearly 5,000 tons of Nabulsi soap annually, over half of all soap production in Palestine. John Bowring wrote of Nabulsi soap in the 1830s that it is, [...] "highly esteemed in the Levant," [...] and Muhammad Kurd Ali, a Syrian historian, wrote in the 1930s that [...] "Nablus soap is the best and most famous soap today for it has, <b>it</b> <b>seems,</b> <b>a</b> quality not found in others and the secret is that it is unadulterated and well produced." ...|$|E
500|$|Brown and {{his wife}} Phyllis {{separated}} in August 1995. Phyllis filed for divorce in Kentucky in 1996, but withdrew the petition amid settlement talks with her husband. After Brown reportedly cut off much of his wife's financial support, she filed a second divorce petition in 1997, this time in Broward County, Florida where her husband was living at the time. After a brief legal fight over whether the proceedings should take place in Kentucky or Florida, the divorce became final in 1998. Later that year, he married former Mrs. Kentucky Jill Louise Roach, 27 years his junior, but they divorced in 2003 for reasons not released. When asked why they divorced he stated [...] "I do have great love for Jill, but something which cannot be overlooked has come up in our marriage. I will always love her and her children, but <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> divorce is our only option now." ...|$|E

500|$|The normal {{rules of}} {{causation}} apply, although {{they can become}} strained {{when compared to the}} various moral issues of importance in cases of homicide. In R v. Pagett, the defendant was found guilty of the manslaughter of a hostage he was using as a human shield, who was killed by police returning fire against the defendant. Whether another's actions are [...] "free, voluntary and informed" [...] is the operating definition, as upheld in R. v Kennedy (No. 2) where the defendant was acquitted. Such an intervening act is known as a [...] "novus actus interveniens". The judgments of several judges in various cases, including Devlin J in R. v Adams appear to confuse causality with motive: where there is a strong moral imperative to clear the defendant, causality is doubted, rather than the mental element (mens rea). Since everyone will die at some point, then even murder is a mere acceleration of death. In Adams the question of life-shortening palliative care was approached, and the need to provide a suitable reason with which to distinguish the doctor from any other murderer. Ultimately <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> special defence was created.|$|E
500|$|Just as Tolkien's {{literary}} {{theories have}} been seen to influence the tale, so have Tolkien's experiences. The Hobbit may be read as Tolkien's parable of World War I with the hero being plucked from his rural home and thrown into a far-off war where traditional types of heroism are shown to be futile. The tale as such explores the theme of heroism. As Janet Croft notes, Tolkien's literary reaction to war at this time differed from most post-war writers by eschewing irony as a method for distancing events and instead using mythology to mediate his experiences. Similarities to the works of other writers who faced the Great War are seen in The Hobbit, including portraying warfare as anti-pastoral: in [...] "The Desolation of Smaug", both the area {{under the influence of}} Smaug before his demise and the setting for The Battle of the Five Armies later are described as barren, damaged landscapes. The Hobbit makes a warning against repeating the tragedies of World War I, and Tolkien's attitude as a veteran may well be summed up by Bilbo's comment: [...] "Victory after all, I suppose! Well, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> very gloomy business." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{mention of}} the [...] "very light ships" [...] (boats) carried {{overland}} has a well-documented ethnographic parallel in the numerous portages of the historical river and lake routes in Fennoscandia and Northern Russia.

2500|$|<b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> {{miracle that}} UE survived the 1950s at all, with attacks coming {{at it from}} all {{directions:}} the federal administration, Congress, Republicans and Democrats, news media, [...] "mainstream" [...] unions of both CIO and AFL, and even {{some members of the}} clergy. What helped UE to weather these storms was its own democratic structure and manner of operation, and its superior record of representing members (when contrasted with the IUE, for example) in collective bargaining and in fighting for shop grievances. Both of these attributes engendered fierce loyalty to UE among many of its members, even as the union was being slandered by powerful forces as some sort of national security threat.|$|E
2500|$|These {{patterns}} {{of discrimination against}} non-whites have led some academic and other activists to advocate {{for use of the}} Portuguese term negro to encompass all African-descended people, in order to stimulate a [...] "black" [...] consciousness and identity. This proposal has been criticized since the term pardo is considered to include a wide range of multiracial people, such as caboclos (mestizos), assimilated Amerindians and tri-racials, not only people of partial African and European descent. Trying to identify this entire group as [...] "black" [...] would be a false imposition of a different identity from outside the culture and deny people their other, equally valid, ancestries and cultures. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>a</b> one-drop rule in reverse.|$|E
