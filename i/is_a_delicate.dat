5|$|Trillium grandiflorum {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular trilliums in cultivation, {{primarily}} because of the size of its flowers and its relative ease of cultivation. Although not particularly demanding, its cultivation is a slow and rather uncertain process, due to usually slow growth, wide variations in growth speed and sometimes capricious germination rates. As a result, the vast majority of plants and rhizomes in commerce are collected in the wild, and such heavy collecting, combined with other pressures such as habitat destruction and grazing, may effectively endanger the plants in some areas. This also creates tensions between Trillium enthusiasts and conservation proponents. Transplantation (as with almost all non-weedy wild plants) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>delicate</b> process, and in many cases results in the death of the plant. In cultivation, T. grandiflorum may flower in as little as 4 to 5 years after germination (compared to the usual 7 to 10 in the wild), but these cases appear to be exceptions rather than the rule. One study revealed 20 or so individuals performing so well out of about 10,000 seeds planted, only 20% of which germinated after a year. However, barring plant destruction, T. grandiflorum can continue flowering every year after it has begun.|$|E

25|$|For over {{a hundred}} years, {{biologists}} have been keeping track of populations of different species with population models. Most models are continuous, but recently scientists {{have been able to}} implement chaotic models in certain populations. For example, a study on models of Canadian lynx showed there was chaotic behavior in the population growth. Chaos can also be found in ecological systems, such as hydrology. While a chaotic model for hydrology has its shortcomings, there is still much to learn from looking at the data through the lens of chaos theory. Another biological application is found in cardiotocography. Fetal surveillance <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>delicate</b> balance of obtaining accurate information while being as noninvasive as possible. Better models of warning signs of fetal hypoxia can be obtained through chaotic modeling.|$|E
25|$|Anal sex can expose its {{participants}} to two principal dangers: infections {{due to the}} high number of infectious microorganisms not found elsewhere on the body, and physical damage to the anus and rectum due to their fragility. Unprotected penile-anal penetration, colloquially known as barebacking, carries a higher risk of passing on sexually transmitted infections (STIs/STDs) because the anal sphincter <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>delicate,</b> easily torn tissue that can provide an entry for pathogens. The high concentration of white blood cells around the rectum, together with the risk of tearing and the colon's function to absorb fluid, are what place those who engage in anal sex at high risk of STIs. Use of condoms, ample lubrication {{to reduce the risk of}} tearing, and safer sex practices in general, reduce the risk of STI transmission. However, a condom can break or otherwise come off during anal sex, and this is more likely to happen with anal sex than with other sex acts because of the tightness of the anal sphincters during friction.|$|E

Speculation by Motography {{states that}} Mack's [...] "contribution {{to the screen}} drama was probably prompted by the distressing Ruth Cruger mystery, which was so cleverly solved by Mrs. Grace Humiston, and follows very closely many of the phases of drama in real life that shocked the world." [...] The April 17, 1917 issue of Motography profiled the film, the first production of Master Drama Features, noting {{that it would be}} shown on a [...] "stage-right" [...] basis after a New York City premier at a Broadway theater. H. D. Fretz noted {{that the majority of the}} scenes were shot indoors and described the photography as excellent. The film was described as breaking a record by Motoplay because of the use of a triple exposure. The brief note stated that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>delicate</b> and precise work that required perfect synchronization that [...] "(the film) had to be taken twenty times before the result was satisfactory to Director S. Rankin Drew." [...] Who's Your Neighbor? was the first film produced by Edward Small. According to the American Film Institute, the film was edited by Frank Lawrence.|$|E

2500|$|Abstract {{concepts}} within {{theoretical physics}} have been invoked to suggest explanations of {{how or why}} preparations might work, including quantum entanglement, quantum nonlocality, the theory of relativity and chaos theory. Contrariwise, quantum superposition has been invoked to explain why homeopathy does not work in double-blind trials. However, the explanations are offered by nonspecialists within the field, and often include speculations that are incorrect in their application of the concepts and not supported by actual experiments. Several of the key concepts of homeopathy conflict with fundamental concepts of physics and chemistry. The use of quantum entanglement to explain homeopathy's purported effects is [...] "patent nonsense", as entanglement <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>delicate</b> state that rarely lasts longer than {{a fraction of a}} second. While entanglement may result in certain aspects of individual subatomic particles acquiring linked quantum states, this does not mean the particles will mirror or duplicate each other, nor cause health-improving transformations.|$|E

2500|$|A leg glance <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>delicate</b> straight-batted shot {{played at}} a ball aimed {{slightly}} {{on the leg}} side, using the bat to flick the ball as it passes the batsman, and requiring some wrist work as well, deflecting towards the square leg or fine leg area. The stroke involves deflecting the bat-face towards the leg side at the last moment, head and body moving inside {{the line of the}} ball. This shot is played [...] "off the toes, shins or hip". It is played off the front foot if the ball is pitched up at the toes or shin of the batsman, or off the back foot if the ball bounces at waist/hip height to the batsman. Although the opposite term off glance is not employed within cricket, the concept of angling the bat face towards the offside to deflect the ball away from the wicket for the purpose of scoring runs through the off side is a commonly used technique. This would commonly be described instead as [...] "running (or steering) the ball down to third man".|$|E
