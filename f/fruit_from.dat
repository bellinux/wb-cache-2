40|$|Differences in tree vigour as {{a result}} of feeder root {{destruction}} by Phytophthora cinnamomi were found to significantly (P < 0. 05) influence disease susceptibility, fruit ripening rates and fruit size of 'Hass' avocado. <b>Fruits</b> <b>from</b> root rot-affected, non-vigorous trees had less anthracnose and took longer to ripen. However, they were probably unmarketable due to their small fruit size compared with <b>fruits</b> <b>from</b> healthy vigorous trees. <b>Fruits</b> <b>from</b> non-vigorous trees also had less pepper spot than vigorous trees, but only {{on the inside of the}} tree canopy. The increased disease resistance of <b>fruits</b> <b>from</b> non-vigorous trees was related to a 40 % increase in the concentration of Ca in the fruit flesh...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the objective of testing the hypothesis that tomato <b>fruits</b> <b>from</b> organic farming accumulate more nutritional compounds, such as phenolics and vitamin C {{as a consequence of the}} stressing conditions associated with farming system. Growth was reduced in <b>fruits</b> <b>from</b> organic farming while titratable acidity, the soluble solids content and the concentrations in vitamin C were respectively + 29 %, + 57 % and + 55 % higher at the stage of commercial maturity. At that time, the total phenolic content was + 139 % higher than in the <b>fruits</b> <b>from</b> conventional farming which seems consistent with the more than two times higher activity of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) we observed throughout fruit development in <b>fruits</b> <b>from</b> organic farming. Cell membrane lipid peroxidation (LPO) degree was 60 % higher in organic tomatoes. SOD activity was also dramatically higher in the <b>fruits</b> <b>from</b> organic farming. Taken together, our observations suggest that tomato <b>fruits</b> <b>from</b> organic farming experienced stressing conditions that resulted in oxidative stress and the accumulation of higher concentrations of soluble solids as sugars and other compounds contributing to fruit nutritional quality such as vitamin C and phenolic compounds...|$|R

5|$|Many lemurs {{that eat}} leaves {{tend to do}} so during times of fruit scarcity, {{sometimes}} suffering weight loss as a result. Most lemur species, including most of the smallest lemurs and excluding some of the indriids, predominantly eat fruit (frugivory) when available. Collectively, lemurs have been documented consuming <b>fruit</b> <b>from</b> at least 86native plant families and 15alien plant families. As with most tropical fruit eaters, the lemur diet is dominated by <b>fruit</b> <b>from</b> Ficus (fig) species. In many anthropoid primates, fruit is a primary source of vitamin C, but unlike anthropoid primates, lemurs (and all strepsirrhines) can synthesize their own vitamin C. Historically, captive lemur diets high in vitamin C-rich fruits have been thought to cause hemosiderosis, a type of iron overload disorder, since vitamin C increases iron absorption. Although lemurs in captivity {{have been shown to}} be prone to hemosiderosis, the frequency of the disease varies across institutions and may depend on the diet, husbandry protocols, and genetic stock. Assumptions about the problem need to be tested separately for each species. The ring-tailed lemur, for instance, seems to be less prone to the disorder than other lemur species.|$|E
5|$|Since almost its {{inception}} in 1914, Grapico was associated with real grape juice by J. Grossman's Sons through its advertisements and business stationery. Publicly associating Grapico with genuine grape juice allowed J. Grossman's Sons to compete directly with real grape juice producers such as Welch Grape Juice Co. and have an advantage over other imitation grape flavored beverage producers. A problem with this approach was that Grapico was an artificial grape drink that included neither real grape juice nor <b>fruit</b> <b>from</b> the grape.|$|E
5|$|The {{mushrooms}} of Russula brevipes often develop under {{masses of}} conifer needles or leaves of broadleaved trees, and <b>fruit</b> <b>from</b> summer to autumn. Forms of the mushroom that develop a bluish band {{at the top}} of the stipe are sometimes referred to as variety acrior. Although edible, Russula brevipes mushrooms have a bland or bitter flavor. They become more palatable once parasitized by the ascomycete fungus Hypomyces lactifluorum, a bright orange mold that covers the fruit body and transforms them into lobster mushrooms.|$|E

There is a lot of information known about <b>fruit</b> tree pollination <b>from</b> temperate climates, but very little information known about <b>fruit</b> tree pollination <b>from</b> tropical climates. <b>Fruits</b> <b>from</b> temperate climates include apples, pears, plums, peaches, cherries, berries, grapes, and nuts which are considered dry <b>fruits.</b> <b>Fruits</b> <b>from</b> tropical climates include bananas, pineapples, papayas, passion fruit, avocado, mango, and members of the genus Citrus.|$|R

5|$|At {{the climax}} of the film, to Tommy's horror the tree finally dies just before arrival, as Izzy had also died just before a cure. A final {{apparition}} of Izzi appears, comforting Tommy in the face of his accepted impending death and suggesting that they may share an afterlife now. He finally understands and embraces his death, moments before the star goes supernova, engulfing the ship and everything within. The traveler's body is absorbed, but the tree flourishes back to life being engulfed by the star dying inside the nebula. Izzi's apparition picks a <b>fruit</b> <b>from</b> the new tree of life and hands it to Tom, the present-day neuroscientist, who plants it in Izzi's grave.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{easy access to the}} ranch and any lodging in the area, {{tourists}} flocked to this site. The 1887 completion of the Southern Pacific line increased the number of visitors, as the railroad featured the ranch in its advertisements in order to distinguish the line from its competitors. Although the ranch was not developed for tourism, the Del Valles, with their Californio sense of hospitality, would lodge the visitors. By October 1888, housing visitors was getting to be so expensive for the family that Reginaldo del Valle pressed his mother to stop being so hospitable. The tourists could be quite a nuisance, and unscrupulous visitors would steal items from the house as souvenirs, or help themselves to <b>fruit</b> <b>from</b> the orchards.|$|E
5|$|Reich {{joined the}} Austro-Hungarian Army during the First World War, serving from 1915 to 1918, {{for the last}} two years as a {{lieutenant}} at the Italian front with 40 men under his command. When the war ended he headed for Vienna, enrolling in law at the University of Vienna, but found it dull and switched to medicine after the first semester. He arrived with nothing in a city with little to offer; the overthrow of the Austria-Hungarian empire a few weeks earlier had left the newly formed Republic of German-Austria in the grip of famine. Reich lived on soup, oats and dried <b>fruit</b> <b>from</b> the university canteen, and shared an unheated room with his brother and another undergraduate, wearing his coat and gloves indoors to stave off the cold. He fell in love with another medical student, Lia Laszky, with whom he was dissecting a corpse, but it was largely unrequited.|$|E
