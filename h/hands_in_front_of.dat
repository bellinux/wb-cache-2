25|$|Mrs. Connally {{testified that}} just after hearing a loud, {{frightening}} noise {{that came from}} somewhere behind her and to her right, she turned toward President Kennedy and saw him raise his arms and elbows, with his <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> his face and throat. She then heard another gunshot and then Governor Connally yelling. Mrs. Connally then turned away from Kennedy toward her husband, at which point another gunshot sounded and she and the limousine's rear interior were covered with fragments of skull, blood, and brain.|$|E
25|$|ASL {{does have}} {{a limited number of}} concatenative affixes. For example, the agentive suffix (similar to the English '-er') is made by placing two B or 5 <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the torso, palms facing each other, and {{lowering}} them. On its own this sign means 'person'; in a compound sign following a verb, it is a suffix for the performer of the action, as in 'drive-er' and 'teach-er'. However, it cannot generally be used to translate English '-er', as it is used with a much more limited set of verbs. It is very similar to the '-ulo' suffix in Esperanto, meaning 'person' by itself and '-related person' when combined with other words.|$|E
25|$|Striptease {{involves}} a slow, sensuous undressing. The stripper may prolong the undressing with delaying tactics {{such as the}} wearing of additional clothes or putting clothes or <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> just undressed body parts such as the breasts or genitalia. The {{emphasis is on the}} act of undressing along with sexually suggestive movement, rather than the state of being undressed. In the past, the performance often finished as soon as the undressing was finished, though today's strippers usually continue dancing in the nude. The costume the stripper wears before disrobing can form part of the act. In some cases, audience interaction can form part of the act, with audience urging the stripper to remove more clothing, or the stripper approaching the audience to interact with them.|$|E

25|$|The {{theme of}} the {{painting}} is inspired from a legend {{of the beginning of}} the 14th century. In 1312, a certain Don Gonzalo Ruíz, native of Toledo, and Señor of the town of Orgaz, died (his family later received the title of Count, by which he is generally and posthumously known). The Count of Orgaz was a pious man who, among other charitable acts, left a sum of money for the enlargement and adornment of the church of Santo Tomé (El Greco's parish church). He was also a philanthropist and a right-thinking Knight. According to the legend, {{at the time he was}} buried, Saint Stephen and Saint Augustine descended in person from the heavens and buried him by their own <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the dazzled eyes of those present.|$|E
25|$|By {{the third}} day of his capture, Bryson had earned {{sufficient}} trust from Berdella to persuade him to establish a regime of tying his <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> him after his sexual abuse rather than above his head and to the bed upon the excuse that his (Berdella's) doing so was restricting the circulation to his arms; he had also persuaded Berdella to leave a television on within the room, with the remote control placed between his legs whenever Berdella was out of the room. However, he would later state to investigators that he had thought almost constantly about escaping. The following day, he managed to break free of his restraints by burning through them using a book of matches Berdella had inadvertently left in the room and within his reach when he had left the house to go to his place of work.|$|E
500|$|In December 2011, Keef {{left his}} grandmother's home holding a coat over his <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> his waistband. A {{policeman}} stopped {{to question the}} rapper, who dropped the coat, flashed a handgun and ran away. Officers chased then 16-year-old Keef, who turned around several times and pointed the gun at them. The policemen [...] "discharged their weapons," [...] but missed. They caught him a half-block later and recovered the pistol, which was loaded. Keef was charged with three counts of aggravated assault with a firearm on a police officer and aggravated unlawful use of a weapon. He was also given a misdemeanor charge for resisting arrest. He {{was held in the}} Cook County Juvenile Detention Center until a judge sentenced him to home confinement at his grandmother’s house.|$|E

By the end of the war, 11 murders and 74 attempted murders had been committed and 96 people were wounded across Scandinavia. A law was passed in Denmark that banned motorcycle clubs from owning or renting property for their club activities. The law has subsequently been repealed on constitutional grounds.|$|E
2500|$|Genie's {{gross motor}} skills were {{extremely}} weak; she could neither {{stand up straight}} nor fully straighten any of her limbs, and had very little endurance. Her movements were very hesitant and unsteady and her characteristic [...] "bunny walk", in which she held her <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> her like claws while ambulating, suggested extreme difficulty with sensory processing and an inability to integrate visual and tactile information. Kent was somewhat surprised to find her fine motor skills were significantly better, determining they were at approximately {{the level of a}} two-year-old. She could not chew and had very severe dysphagia, totally incapable of swallowing solid or even soft food and barely able to swallow liquids. When eating she held anything she could not swallow in her mouth until her saliva broke it down, and if this took too long she spat it out and mashed it with her fingers. She was also completely incontinent, and did not respond to extreme temperatures.|$|E

2500|$|During the American Idol competition, The Smoking Gun {{revealed}} that Clark {{had been arrested}} at his Topeka, Kansas home on October 12, 2002, after neighbors called police after hearing a commotion within the residence, including a girl yelling. Police arrived and questioned Clark and his 15-year-old sister Alysha, after which Clark became confrontational with the officers. Clark alleges police misconduct in handling the matter, asserting that he was beaten by the officers, who ultimately wrestled Clark to the pavement and handcuffed him behind his back. [...] After managing to get his handcuffed <b>hands</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> him in the squad car, he was shown a taser and warned he would be shot with it if he continued to resist, at which point he relented. He was charged with misdemeanor battery on four police officers and his sister, and endangering the welfare of a child. [...] However both Clark and his sister Alysha have denied that he ever hit her, and Alysha echoed her brother's account {{of the way the}} situation transpired.|$|E
