5|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> plant a few acorns, and I {{have lived}} to see one or two trees growing: gay rights, freedom of information, CND. I'm not {{claiming}} them for myself but you feel you have encouraged other people and see the arguments developing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Adela, you do; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> I think I am {{honest and}} open. At any rate, I {{strive to be}} so. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{understand}} me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> and {{sometimes}} I think you don't. Anyway, you don't know your fellow-woman. There was that affair of the Spaniards." ...|$|E
6000|$|Prosp. How can <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{remember}} hers, [...] When {{you forgot}} your own? <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not see [...] The man, whom I commanded you to shun? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, let me git out!" [...] yelled Peleg Snuggers, but at {{that moment}} the snowball began to turn over. [...] "I'll be killed! Oh, dear, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> this a-purpose, <b>you</b> rascals!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll {{remember}} it, auntie," [...] I said, wearied {{out with}} excitement. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> wrong, all the same. In {{a case like}} this, it's everybody's first duty to tell all he knows, {{in the interests of}} justice." ...|$|R
60|$|A.--Well, however unjust {{you are to}} me, and to my {{neighbour}} too, I {{will not}} undeceive you at present; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not deserve it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes you do, I think. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Come, come, Lady Dedlock, we {{must not}} fence and parry now. You know you like this girl." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon-my word, my love, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> Mrs. Crawley injustice," [...] Sir Pitt said; {{at which}} speech Rebecca was vastly relieved. [...] "Indeed I believe her to be--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You look well," [...] said Mrs. Prentice. [...] "Neither of {{you seem}} to have changed much," [...] she added, looking from him to her daughter. [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> quite well not to write. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it was much the best." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> {{know why}} <b>you</b> <b>did</b> it, and I do not blame you," [...] said Dane. [...] "I shall most clearly {{remember}} that, when I was sick, you {{saved my life}} for me, as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> again when <b>you</b> helped my comrade to forestall Rideau." ...|$|R
6000|$|Your {{account of}} your journey {{reminds me of}} one of the latest American stories, how a {{traveller}} by stage-coach said to the driver: [...] "Did you ever see a snail, sir?" [...] "Yes, sir." [...] "Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> meet him, sir?" [...] "I didn't meet him, sir!" [...] "Wa'al, sir, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> if you'll excuse me, for I'm damned if you ever overtook him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I'm {{pleased to}} have you throw the judge over, and employ me, but, all the same, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> him an injustice. He's a good, square man." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her waiting eyes {{recalled}} {{him from}} his inquiry, and with an effort he answered, [...] "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> have your being here and now, Miss Gerald, to an unusual degree." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Receive him quietly! How can I {{be quiet}} {{when he will}} have come back to me? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not realise the {{condition}} I have been in {{during the last three}} months." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Master {{took this}} {{considerably}} in, but made little of it. [...] "You're a gentleman {{and a man}} of genius. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> might <b>do</b> something." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Put me off! By ----, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> see <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> that! Why, {{the whole}} State would rise and wipe {{you and your}} tribe out of existence." [...] He turned threateningly and towered over Curtis, who was seated.|$|R
6000|$|... “There, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> Dickon, <b>you</b> <b>do</b> the lad injustice,” {{said the}} Judge; “he uses much {{discretion}} in critical moments. Dost thou not think so, Bess?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] replied Miriam, [...] "you say a great deal, {{and much}} of it, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not mean. Please be silent; at this moment I wish to study your lips, and not your words." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You have honoured me of late by {{choosing}} me {{as one of}} your confessors, though <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not tell me everything, my Lord Abbot; therefore I bare my mind to you," [...] continued Brother Martin apologetically.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{must come}} and dine with me,' said Lady Bellair to Count Mirabel, 'because you talk well across a table. I want {{a man who}} talks well across a table. So few can do it without bellowing. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it very well.' ...|$|E
60|$|BENTLEY. <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> Johnny {{was rather}} rough on me, though. He told me nobody here liked me; and I was silly {{enough to believe}} him.|$|R
6000|$|... “I heeded not his eyes, nor his knees, {{which would}} be all the better for a little humbling. Really, my dear sir, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> {{exercise}} the Christian virtue of patience to the utmost. I was disgusted with his airs, long before he consented to make one of our family. Truly we are much honored by the association! In what apartment is he to be placed, sir; and at what table is he to receive his nectar and ambrosia?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then may I {{not tell}} <b>you</b> what <b>I</b> <b>think?</b> If <b>you</b> <b>do</b> {{not mean to}} marry that American young lady you should not raise false hopes." ...|$|R
60|$|You don't {{know what}} I mean? What a pity! But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> I think you must. Look here. I am the boy {{at what is}} called The Refreshment Room at Mugby Junction, and what's proudest boast is, that it never yet {{refreshed}} a mortal being.|$|E
60|$|LORD SUMMERHAYS. Not at all. I {{had five}} kings to manage in Jinghiskahn; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> your husband some injustice, Mrs Tarleton. They pretended {{to like me}} because I kept their {{brothers}} from murdering them; but I didnt like them. And I like Tarleton.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{said that}} I wished for one, and Grace got {{off without a}} word, and searched {{everywhere}} at Avoncester till she found one {{in a corner of}} the Dean's greenhouse. There, now you have a leaf in your fingers, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> feel at home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{may take}} the carrion, if you want to. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can <b>do</b> no more than order it to be flung into a ditch and buried there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> have <b>done</b> capitally, Luka. <b>You</b> {{have made}} the money go a long way. I suppose you have spent the hundred roubles you took with you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Mr. Sanderson! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> are <b>doing</b> our chum an injustice," [...] cried Sam. [...] "It wasn't {{his fault}} {{that he was}} robbed of that four {{thousand}} dollars." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hardly know}} her," [...] said Imogene. [...] "The world {{considers}} her irresistible, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Nevertheless, I wish {{she could have}} had her way in this matter, and I think it quite a pity that Northborough has {{turned out not to}} be a family seat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Aye! but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> Sir Andrew. You {{must know}} that I am {{speaking}} the truth. Look these facts straight in the face. Percy has sailed for Calais, I presume for some lonely part of the coast, and Chauvelin is on his track. HE has posted for Dover, and will cross the Channel probably to-night. What {{do you think will}} happen?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} so?" [...] she answered, {{looking at him}} inquiringly. [...] "I don't quite see how you make that out. If you believe in {{what we have been}} taught, as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> {{wherever}} it was you found yourself there would be plenty of company, and if, like me, you do not believe in anything, why, then, you would have slept, and sleep asks for nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you {{say that}} again <b>I</b> shall <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> it on purpose!" [...] Delia declared. [...] "ARE you {{thinking}} of George Flack?" [...] she repeated in a moment.|$|R
6000|$|... “That {{man will}} never tell her—or speak {{a word to}} clear <b>you.</b> Still, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> can <b>do</b> without friends of that kind. You have good ones in this country.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{grandfather}} was a fine man, Mr. Durrett," [...] she informed Hambleton. [...] "It is a pity for <b>you,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> that <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not have to work." ...|$|R
