To reduce the large extrinsic memory needed in double-binary turbo decoding, the proposed decoder exchanges the bit-level extrinsic <b>information</b> <b>values</b> rather than the traditional symbol-level extrinsic <b>information</b> <b>values,</b> {{which is achieved by}} deriving two simple conversions. The proposed turbo decoder, with a low-complexity hardware interleaver generating interleaved addresses for two data flows simultaneously, provides an efficient stopping criterion for double-binary turbo decoding using bit-level extrinsic information as well as huge memory size reduction of 20. 6 %.

40|$|This is {{an inquiry}} into the “actionable {{credibility}} ” of <b>information</b> <b>values</b> in informing and how it depends on indirect attributes of information quality. Empirical survey-based research by Wang and Strong (1996) ignores the multidimensional aspects of credibility. Studies that ignore them may produce unreliable results. Most publications discuss quality attributes as independent fac-tors. This paper identifies and describes the ignored dependencies with regard to credibility. To yield research results of a more lasting validity, one must go beyond empirical studies.

5000|$|In {{some cases}} it is {{possible}} to achieve a good correspondence between [...] and [...] with numbers as low as [...] and , while in other cases the number of bins required may be higher. The maximum for [...] is determined by H(X), which is in turn determined by the number of bins in each axis, therefore, the mutual <b>information</b> <b>value</b> will be dependent on the number of bins selected for each variable. In order to compare mutual information values obtained with partitions of different sizes, the mutual <b>information</b> <b>value</b> is normalized by dividing by the maximum achieveable value for the given partition size. Entropy is maximized by uniform probability distributions, or in this case, bins with the same number of elements. Also, joint entropy is minimized by having a one-to-one correspondence between bins. If we substitute such values in the formula, we can see that the maximum value achieveable by the MI for a given pair [...] of bin counts is [...] Thus, this value is used as a normalizing divisor for each pair of bin counts.|$|E
