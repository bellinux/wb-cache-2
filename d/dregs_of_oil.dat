40|$|Activated carbon from coffee dregs for TSS, BOD and COD {{removal of}} tapioca {{industrial}} wastewater has been developed. The research aimed {{to know the}} quality of activated carbon from <b>dregs</b> <b>of</b> coffee as adsorbent, consist of total rendemen, water content, ashes content and iodium adsorption; {{to know about the}} optimum contact time and optimum pH from activated carbon on reducing BOD, COD and TSS value from tapioca industrial wastewater and also to know about the decrease percentage of BOD, COD and TSS value using activated carbon from <b>dregs</b> <b>of</b> coffee. Activated carbon from <b>dregs</b> <b>of</b> coffee are activated using HCl 0, 1 N and carbonization at 350 °C in muffle furnace. Then, activated carbon was contacted with the tapioca industrial wastewater and used on decreasing BOD, COD and TSS value from tapioca industrial wastewater with contact time varieties 0, 10, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes and at pH varieties of wastewater 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. The decreasing of BOD value was measured by Winkler method, decreasing of COD value measured by iodometric method and decreasing of TSS value measured by gravimetric method. The result of the research showed that the activated carbon produced characteristic consist of rendemen 14, 55 %; water content 3, 4 %; ashes content 1, 88 % and iodium adsorption 750, 25 mg/g. It is indicated that the activated carbon that is got from <b>dregs</b> <b>of</b> coffee fulfill the criteria required by SNI No. 06 - 3730 - 1995. The result of research also showed that the activated carbon from <b>dregs</b> <b>of</b> coffee could be used for reducing the BOD, COD and TSS value in tapioca industrial wastewater at the optimum contact time of 30 minutes and pH 7. The optimum percentage of activated carbon from <b>dregs</b> <b>of</b> coffee in decreasing BOD value of tapioca industrial wastewater are 33, 51 %; COD value 78, 96 % and TSS value 61, 05 %...|$|R

60|$|The {{town has}} lately yawned a weary laugh over {{an enemy of}} yours, who has {{produced}} two heavy volumes, styled by him 'The Real Shelley.' The real Shelley, it appears, was Shelley as conceived of by a worthy gentleman so prejudiced and so skilled in taking up things by the wrong handle that I wonder he has not made a name in the exact science of Comparative Mythology. He criticises you {{in the spirit of}} that Christian Apologist, the Englishman who called you 'a damned Atheist' in the post-office at Pisa. He finds that you had 'a little turned-up nose,' a feature no less important in his system than was the nose of Cleopatra (according to Pascal) {{in the history of the}} world. To be in harmony with your nose, you were a 'phenomenal' liar, an ill-bred, ill-born, profligate, partly insane, an evil-tempered monster, a self-righteous person, full of self-approbation--in fact you were the Beast of this pious Apocalypse. Your friend Dr. Lind was an embittered and scurrilous apothecary, 'a bad old man.' But enough of this inopportune brawler. For Humanity, of which you hoped such great things, Science predicts extinction in a night of Frost. The sun will grow cold, slowly--as slowly as doom came on Jupiter in your 'Prometheus,' but as surely. If this nightmare be fulfilled, perhaps the Last Man, in some fetid hut on the ice-bound Equator, will read. by a fading lamp charged with the <b>dregs</b> <b>of</b> the <b>oil</b> in his cruse, the poetry of Shelley. So reading, he, the latest of his race, will not wholly be deprived of those sights which alone (says the nameless Greek) make life worth enduring. In your verse he will have sight of sky, and sea, and cloud, the gold of dawn and the gloom of earthquake and eclipse, he will be face to face, in fancy, with the great powers that are dead, sun, and ocean, and the illimitable azure of the heavens. In Shelley's poetry, while Man endures, all those will survive; for your 'voice is as the voice of winds and tides,' and perhaps more deathless than all of these, and only perishable with the perishing of the human spirit.|$|R
