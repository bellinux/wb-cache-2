40|$|Background: The use of {{physical}} restraints by family caregivers with home-dwelling elders {{has not been}} extensively studied {{but it might be}} widespread. Furthermore, it is also not clear how <b>home</b> care <b>providers</b> who support family caregivers perceive the use {{of physical}} restraint in elders’ homes. This study assessed family caregivers’ and home care providers’ knowledge and perceptions of physical restraint used with elders living at home in Japan, a country with the highest proportion of elders in the world and where family caregiving is common. Methods: We undertook a cross-sectional study of 494 family caregivers, 201 home helpers, 78 visiting nurses, 131 visiting physicians, and 158 care managers of home-dwelling frail elders needing some care and medical support in Japan, using questionnaires on knowledge of 11 physical restraint procedures prohibited in institutions and 10 harmful effects of physical restraints, perceptions of 17 reasons for requiring physical restraints, and experiences involving physical restraint use. Results: Family caregivers were aware of significantly fewer recognized prohibited physical restraint procedures and recognized harmful effects of physical restraint than <b>home</b> care <b>providers,</b> and differences among <b>home</b> care <b>providers</b> were significant. The average importance rating from 1 (least) to 5 (most) of the 17 reasons for requiring physical restraints was significantly higher among family caregivers than <b>home</b> care <b>providers,</b> and significantly different among the <b>home</b> care <b>providers.</b> Moreover, these differences depended in part on participation in physical restraint education classes. While 20. 1 % of family caregivers had wavered over using physical restraints, 40. 5 % of <b>home</b> care <b>providers</b> had seen physical restraints used in elders’ homes and 16. 7 % had advised physical restraint use or used physical restraints themselves. Conclusions: Knowledge and perceptions of physical restraints differed between family caregivers and <b>home</b> care <b>providers</b> and were also diverse among <b>home</b> care <b>providers.</b> Because both groups might be involved in physical restraint use with home-dwelling elders, <b>home</b> care <b>providers</b> should acquire standardized and appropriate knowledge and perceptions of physical restraints to help family caregivers minimize abusive physical restraint use. 浜松医科大学学位論文　医博論第 514 号（平成 26 年 6 月 20 日...|$|R

The discovery of patient expectations {{and the application}} of proxemics within the intercultural health encounter may lead to improvement of provider-client relations and adherence to recommended health regimens. ^ A total of 398 international students completed a 97 -item questionnaire dealing with four communication factors: (1) communicator style, (2) affective behavior, (3) information processing, and (4) time with the provider. A partially nested repeated measures design was used. Six geocultural groups were created and subsumed under two levels of cultural contact preference. Treatments consisted of items directed toward the: (1) <b>home</b> <b>provider,</b> (2) US doctor, (3) US nurse, and (4) US technician. ^ Although major hypotheses received only partial support, several interesting patterns emerged. The <b>home</b> <b>provider</b> and US doctor were found to be the friendliest, most attentive, and relaxed of the four providers. The US nurse was the main information giver and receiver. The US doctor, interestingly enough, was viewed most positively in caring and sympathetic behavior toward patients. ^ The US nurse was the only provider with significant results for virtually all hypotheses; this indicates she played an integral role in the health encounter. Geocultural differences were marked between Arabs and Indians and between Asians and Mediterraneans, with Indians consistently more negative in their responses to all providers on all dimensions. The exploratory hypotheses found significant relationships among affective behavior, communicator style, and time for both the <b>home</b> <b>provider</b> and US doctor. ^ Regression analyses found patient satisfaction constructs to be partially explained by the communication factors. The communicative patterns of the <b>home</b> <b>provider</b> and US doctor were distinctly different in the first two SSA clusters. ...|$|E

40|$|Caretelization’ {{is a term}} coined to {{describe}} the process, in a substantially privatized care home sector, whereby large corporate providers have gained greater market share {{through the process of}} mergers, acquisitions and takeovers. It has been argued that this process has reduced choice and weakened accountability for older people as consumers and local authorities as commissioners. The care regulator has also had difficulty in keeping up with complex and changing ownership patterns. In an earlier article it was predicted that with market concentration likely to increase, such problems would intensify. Prompted by the market failure of Britain’s largest private care <b>home</b> <b>provider,</b> Southern Cross, in 2011, this commentary reflects on the perils of relying on a privatized and marketized system of care homes for vulnerable older people, particularly as the regulator appears powerless to take effective action in such circumstances...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Since Medicaid is jointly {{financed by}} {{the federal and state}} governments, state {{officials}} have sought to offset state expenditures by maximizing federal contri-butions. One such strategy is to adopt a provider tax, which enables states to collect revenues from providers; those revenues are then used to pay for services rendered to Medicaid recipients, thereby leveraging federal matching dollars without concomi-tant increases in state expenditures. The number of states adopting a nursing home tax increased from thirteen to thirty-one between 2000 and 2004. This study seeks to identify the factors that spurred the rapid increase in nursing <b>home</b> <b>provider</b> taxes following implementation of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Results indicate that states with more powerful nursing home lobbies, lower proportions of private pay nursing home residents, worse fiscal health, weaker fiscal capacity, broader Medic-aid eligibility, and nursing home supply restrictions were more likely to adopt. This implies that state officials react rationally to prevailing fiscal and programmatic cir-cumstances when formulating policy under Medicaid and that providers seek relief, in part, from the adverse fiscal consequences of federal policy changes by promoting policy change at the state level. Medicaid, which in the United States provides health and long-term care coverage to the poor and disabled, is jointly funded by federal and state governments but is administered by the states. Federal contributions are determined by the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP), which is inversely related to state per capita income and ranges from 50 to 8...|$|E
40|$|Class of 2006 AbstractObjectives: To {{determine}} {{the economic impact}} of controlled substance destruction in multiple long term care facilities in Southern Arizona and to identify related demographic characteristics of the patients and facilities. Methods: Subjects had controlled substance prescriptions destroyed at nursing homes serviced by a pharmacy nursing <b>home</b> <b>provider</b> in Tucson, Arizona. Controlled substances destruction records and existing prescription records were reviewed and data was collected on the name, strength, number of units destroyed, date of destruction and schedule of each controlled medication that was destroyed for a particular patient {{over the course of a}} year. Demographic data was collected on patient gender, age, type of insurance coverage and the size of the nursing home facilities. Results: A total of 1095 controlled substance prescriptions were destroyed during the time period of the study and the total cost of destroyed medication was 26, 886. 37. The average cost of destroyed medication per prescription was 24. 55 ± 60. 38 (mean ± SD). Schedule II controlled substances accounted for the highest total cost per prescription destroyed and destruction of unused controlled substances cost indigent insurance programs more than any of the other payers studied. There was no difference in mean cost per prescription destroyed by facility, therapeutic class or between women and men. Conclusions: The value of controlled substance destruction in long term care facilities is sizeable. To reduce waste, prescribers and pharmacy providers should initially dispense moderate quantities of controlled substances until it is apparent that the medication is tolerable and efficacious for the patient...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: To {{enable users}} {{to utilize the}} {{services}} of various providers of multimedia services based on the session initiation protocol (SIP), some kind of interaction is required between the foreign provider and the <b>home</b> <b>provider</b> of the users. Such interaction is required for example to allow a user to utilize services provided by a foreign service provider while the user is on travel. In this paper we describe two possible approaches for exchanging authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) information between foreign and home providers, namely: SIP dependent and independent inter-domain AAA communication. In the SIP dependent scenario, SIP is used as the communication protocol between the interacting providers and for carrying any information {{that needs to be}} exchanged between the providers. With the SIP independent scenario a special AAA protocol is used between the domains for exchanging AAA related information. Both approaches will be described in terms of message sequences that would be exchanged and will be analyzed in terms of their efficiency, flexibility and security. The here described scenarios present an overview of various efforts currently being followed in the standardization groups and are based on standardized protocols.

40|$|Summary Background Depression {{is common}} and is {{associated}} with poor outcomes among elderly care-home residents. Exercise is a promising low-risk intervention for depression in this population. We tested the hypothesis that a moderate intensity exercise programme would reduce the burden of depressive symptoms in residents of care homes. Methods We did a cluster-randomised controlled trial in care homes in two regions in England; northeast London, and Coventry and Warwickshire. Residents aged 65 years or older were eligible for inclusion. A statistician independent of the study randomised each home (1 to 1 · 5 ratio, stratified by location, minimised by type of <b>home</b> <b>provider</b> [local authority, voluntary, private and care home, private and nursing home] and size of home [< 32 or ≥ 32 residents]) into intervention and control groups. The intervention package included depression awareness training for care-home staff, 45 min physiotherapist-led group exercise sessions for residents (delivered twice weekly), and a whole home component designed to encourage more physical activity in daily life. The control consisted of only the depression awareness training. Researchers collecting follow-up data from individual participants and the participants themselves were inevitably aware of home randomisation because of the physiotherapists' activities within the home. A researcher masked to study allocation coded NHS routine data. The primary outcome was number of depressive symptoms on the geriatric depression scale- 15 (GDS- 15). Follow-up was for 12 months. This trial is registered with ISRCTN Register, number ISRCTN 43769277. Findings Care homes were randomised between Dec 15, 2008, and April 9, 2010.

We delivered 3191 group exercise sessions attended on average by five study participants and five non-study residents. Of residents with a GDS- 15 score, 374 of 765 (49 %) were depressed at baseline; 484 of 765 (63 %) provided 12 month follow-up scores. Overall the GDS- 15 score was 0 · 13 (95 % CI − 0 · 33 to 0 · 60) points higher (worse) at 12 months for the intervention group compared with the control group. Among residents depressed at baseline, GDS- 15 score was 0 · 22 (95 % CI − 0 · 52 to 0 · 95) points higher at 6 months in the intervention group than in the control group.
