5000|$|EPM is treatable, but {{irreversible}} {{damage to the}} nervous system is possible. It is important to identify the disease {{as early as possible}} and begin treatment with antiprotozoal drugs. There are currently three FDA approved treatments available in the US: ReBalance (sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine), Marquis (ponazuril), and Protazil (<b>diclazuril).</b> These drugs minimize the infection but do not kill the parasite. The use of anti-inflammatory agents such as Banamine, corticosteroids, or phenylbutazone are often used to help reduce inflammation and limit further damage to the CNS. Antioxidants, such as vitamin E may help promote the restoration of nervous tissue. Response to treatment is often variable, and treatment may be expensive. Recently, antiprotozoal treatments that kill the parasite and clear the infection have shown promise. [...] The inflammatory component is thought responsible for the symptoms of EPM; anti inflammatory drugs that target the IL-6 pathway have been particularly effective at reversing symptoms.|$|E

The metabolic fate of <b>diclazuril</b> in chicken and turkey is qualitatively similar, <b>diclazuril</b> being the marker residue in tissues. At a zero withdrawal time, the theoretical consumer exposure to the total residues from both chickens and turkeys represents about 13 % of the ADI.

40|$|AbstractA blinded, randomized, controlled, multi-centric {{field study}} was {{conducted}} on French dairy farms (n= 9) to evaluate the long term efficacy of metaphylactic, single oral treatments with either 1 mg/kg body weight (BW) of <b>diclazuril</b> (Vecoxan®), or 15 mg/kg BW of toltrazuril (Baycox®) against natural infections with Eimeria zuernii and/or Eimeria bovis, compared to untreated control animals. A total of 199 calves from nine commercial farms aged between 21 and 55 days old {{at the start of}} study were included and randomly allocated to one of three groups. Calves on all farms were observed for a period of 78 days post treatment, using both parasitological (oocyst excretion), and clinical parameters (faecal score and body weight). The assessment of efficacy was based on both control of oocyst excretion, and on the average daily weight gains throughout the study. During the whole study period, the mean number of days with diarrhoea (≥ 2) was similar (0. 7 days) between treated groups. Excretion in the untreated group peaked at 21 days after treatment. In both the <b>diclazuril</b> and toltrazuril-treated groups, mean oocyst excretion decreased dramatically in the five days following treatment. Thereafter, particularly {{towards the end of the}} study period, oocyst counts and percentage levels of E. zuernii were highest in the toltrazuril-treated group. In pooled data from all trial sites, the average daily weight gain was significantly (p= 0. 01) higher (+ 0. 057 kg/day) in the <b>diclazuril</b> group when compared to the toltrazuril group, and the average body weight gain of the <b>diclazuril</b> treated group was 4. 4 kg higher than the toltrazuril group. On eight of the nine trial sites, the average daily gain was greater in the <b>diclazuril</b> group than in the toltrazuril group. This study demonstrates that, over an extended observation period of 78 days, metaphylactic treatment with both <b>diclazuril</b> and toltrazuril reduces the impact of coccidiosis, but greater performance benefits based on average daily weight gains, were achieved following the use of <b>diclazuril...</b>|$|E

40|$|Clinacox® 0. 5 % is a feed {{additive}} containing 0. 5 % <b>diclazuril</b> {{and is used}} to control coccidiosis in poultry. The previous conclusion on the safety of <b>diclazuril</b> in chickens for fattening at the use level of 1 mg/kg complete feed is extended to chickens reared for laying. Chickens reared for laying are in a similar physiological stage as chickens for fattening. The use level proposed for <b>diclazuril</b> in feed {{is the same for}} both categories of birds. Consequently, the metabolic fate and residue status of this additive described for chickens for fattening can be extrapolated to chickens reared for laying. Feeding <b>diclazuril</b> at 1 mg/kg complete feed to chickens reared for laying for the first 16 weeks of life would result in negligibly low or absent residues of <b>diclazuril</b> in the first eggs for production. Therefore, maximum residue levels (MRLs) for eggs are not necessary. The previous assessment of consumer safety for the use of <b>diclazuril</b> in chickens for fattening is confirmed and extended to chickens reared for laying. The same MRLs for tissues as already established can be applied. Clinacox® has a low irritation potential for the eye and skin. Skin sensitisation was not observed. Considering the particle size (particle of respirable size) and dusting potential, exposure by inhalation cannot be excluded, although workers’ exposure has been calculated to be low in comparison with the ADI. In the absence of any data on respiratory toxicity, a hazard from inhalation of dust cannot be entirely excluded and appropriate protective measures should be taken. The use of Clinacox® at 1 mg/kg complete feed does not pose a risk to the terrestrial or aquatic environment.

There is an urgent need for safe and effective therapies to encounter congenital and persisting toxoplasmosis. The hypothesis was: Combination <b>Diclazuril</b> plus Atovaquone to exert a novel therapeutic synergy to prevent toxoplasmosis syndromes. Methods. Pregnant dams were treated with <b>Diclazuril</b> and Atovaquone monotherapy or combination therapy and infected intraperitoneally with Toxoplasma tachyzoites (600). Results. Infected dams developed severe toxoplasmosis associated syndrome with increases in the abdominal adiposity surrounding uteri, gansterointestinal and other internal organs and excessive weight gain. Numerous organisms along with infiltration of inflammatory cells were detected scattered into adipose tissues. Combination therapy (p< 0. 01) {{and to a lesser extent}} <b>Diclazuril</b> (p< 0. 05) protected dams from inflammatory fat and excess weight gains. This was consistent with pancreatitis development in infected dams (versus normal p< 0. 05) with infiltration of inflammatory cells, degeneration and necrosis of pancreatic cells followed by the degeneration and loss of islets. Combination and monotherapy protected dams from these inflammatory and pathological aspects of pancreatitis. Infected dams exhibited severe colitis, and colonic tissues significantly shortened in length. Brush border epithelial cells were replaced with infiltration of lymphocytes, granulocytes, and microabscess formations into cryptic microstructures. Combination therapy synergistically preserved colonic structure and normalized pathological damages (p< 0. 001) and to a lesser degree <b>Diclazuril</b> monotherapy protected dams from colitis (p< 0. 05) and gastrointestinal toxoplasmosis.

An avian-derived halofuginone-specific scFv library was constructed, from which the best scFv isolated did not possess the required analytical sensitivity. To circumvent this, genetic engineering via light-chain shuffling of the optimal light:heavy chain pairings of the scFv library were investigated. Use of this light-chain shuffled library and rigorous screening, led to the isolation of a scFv with a 185 -fold greater sensitivity than the original. This scFv was incorporated into both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Biacore assay formats that were applied successfully for the detection of halofuginone in ‘spiked’ egg samples. Immune phage display libraries were constructed and screened for <b>diclazuril</b> using a number of diclazuril-conjugates. A functional diclazuril-specific scFv could not be isolated, due to complications which arose during library amplification.

The farm and <b>diclazuril</b> (Vecoxan®) effect was evaluated by measuring the following parameters: age at first and last positive analysis and maximum and mean values of oocysts per gram of feces (OPG) observed, maximum and mean values of respiratory score, mean of weeks with respiratory score equal or greater than four, maximum and mean values of fecal score, days, time spent and costs of treatment for diarrhea and total, death and live weight at two months old. These parameters were subjected to nonparametric analysis of variance (ANOVA). The effectiveness of <b>diclazuril</b> was assessed by fecal oocyst count reduction test (FOCRT). Twenty-three calves were selected by convenience to the control group (CG) or to the <b>diclazuril</b> group (DG) and monitored in parallel.

40|$|The European Union Reference Laboratory for Feed Additives (EURL-FA), {{hosted by}} the Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (IRMM) of the Joint Research Centre (JRC), a Directorate General of the European Commission, is, among other tasks, {{mandated}} to provide scientific support to National Reference Laboratories (NRLs) {{in the field of}} the control of the authorised feed additives [1]. In this frame the EURL-FA has been contacted in June 2013 by an official control laboratory and its related National Reference Laboratory regarding severe technical problems when implementing an official method established by Commission Regulation (EC) No 152 / 2009 [2] for the determination of a specific coccidiostat, <b>diclazuril,</b> authorised as feed additive by the EU legislation [3]. The EURL-FA first conducted a survey among all NRLs for feed additives control & authorisation to gather their experiences with the Community method for the determination of <b>diclazuril</b> at authorised additive level in feed. The information provided by the NRL's hinted at a major flaw in a specific part of the method description of the Commission Regulation. Following the survey and reporting the issue to the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety (DG SANTE), it was decided to implement the method described in the Commission Regulation (EC) No 152 / 2009 [2] at the premises of the EURL-FA Control in order to identify the technical reason for this problem. The study performed at the EURL-FA Control confirmed the lack of fitness for purpose reported by the laboratories and due to a significant error in the method description as given in the European Commission Regulation [2]. The method was therefore modified at the EURL-FA Control and the results from the single-laboratory validation of this method showed satisfactory performance characteristics. Moreover, a modification of Commission Regulation (EC) No 152 / 2009 was considered necessary, to remove the error in the corresponding method description. In the 2014 annual workshops (EURL-FA Control and EURL-FA Authorisation) the results of the implementation, optimisation and validation of the method at the EURL-FA were presented to both networks of NRLs and discussion was launched on how to cope with this problem in the best way. As a conclusion, it was decided that the EURL-FA would organise a collaborative study among the NRLs in order to evaluate the fitness for purpose of the optimised method, which corrects the error found in the method description. This collaborative study was conducted in 2015 and the EURL-FA presented the results in the annual workshops of the EURL-FA Authorisation and EURL-FA Control respectively, in November 2015. The main aim of the collaborative study presented here was to assess the method performance characteristics of the corrected method based on high performance liquid chromatography coupled to spectrophotometric detection (LC-UV or LC-DAD) for the determination of <b>diclazuril</b> at additive level in feed. The required target limits of detection and quantification were respectively 0. 1 mg kg- 1 and 0. 5 mg kg- 1. According to the standard operational procedure (SOP) of the corrected method, the test portion, after addition of an internal standard, was extracted with acidified methanol and an aliquot of the extract was purified on a C 18 solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridge, containing 5000 mg of the SPE sorbent. <b>Diclazuril</b> was eluted from the cartridge with a mixture of acidified methanol and water. After evaporation, the residue was dissolved in the mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMFA) / water. The content of <b>diclazuril</b> was determined by ternary gradient reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a UV spectrophotometry detector measuring at 280 nm. In total 5 samples corresponding to 4 blind duplicates and 1 blank feed were sent to 15 laboratories and 14 laboratories reported results. Statistical evaluation revealed that the relative standard deviation for repeatability (RSDr) ranged from 4. 5 % to 11. 2 % and the relative standard deviation for reproducibility (RSDR) varied between 14. 3 % and 18. 1 %. The method showed acceptable within-laboratory and between-laboratory precision, since the calculated HORRAT values were in all cases below the critical value of 1. 5. In addition, no false positive was found. Based on the data of the collaborative study and on the discussions, it was concluded during the workshops of 2015 that the EURL-FA will submit to the European Commission a recommendation for the revision of the current Community method. The recommendation will include a proposal for the final text of the method, drafted by the EURL-FA and consolidated after review by the NRLs (Authorisation and Control networks), for its inclusion in the revised Regulation replacing (EC) No 152 / 2009.

40|$|Coccidiosis is an {{economically}} important enteric disease of poultry caused by protozoan parasites {{belonging to the}} genus Eimeria. Drugs are most commonly used to control coccidiosis. Widespread usage of anticoccidial drugs in the field has resulted in development of drug resistant strains and consequently decreased drug efficacy. An alternative control strategy using attenuated vaccines is desired. A series of experiments was designed to identify, isolate and attenuate a strain of a common and pathogenic species of Eimeria of turkeys, E. meleagrimitis. Sensitivity of field isolates of turkey coccidia to the anticoccidials drugs amprolium, clopidol, <b>diclazuril,</b> and monensin was investigated. A total of thirty-four isolates comprising mixed species from farms across the country were tested. Of these, four isolates were sensitive to monensin, twelve sensitive to <b>diclazuril,</b> and seventeen sensitive to clopidol and none to amprolium. One isolate, designated MN 2, was sensitive to three drugs tested and was selected for further investigation. The different Eimeria species present in the isolates were identified using polymerase chain reaction amplification of cox- 1 gene and E. meleagrimitis {{was the most common}} species seen. A pure clone of E. meleagrimitis was developed and the pathogenicity and fecundity of the isolated E. meleagrimitis strain was tested and compared to a standard reference E. meleagrimitis strain. Data from the parameters tested showed that the strain had the same characteristics as that of the reference strain. An attenuated line of E. meleagrimitis was developed by repeated propagation of the parasite in turkeys and collection of the very first oocysts produced following infection. After twenty generations of selection, a line with abbreviated life cycle of - 16 h was developed. Pathogenicity and immunogenicity of this line was tested and compared with the parent strain. The attenuated line was proven to be non-pathogenic but was immunogenic. The developed line is a candidate for attenuated vaccine against turkey coccidiosis...|$|E

In this paper, {{we present a}} selective liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method to analyze residues of five synthetic coccidiostats in eggs: clazuril, <b>diclazuril,</b> robenidine, nicarbazin, toltrazuril and its two metabolites. The extraction efficiency was evaluated by testing several solvents, pH, different volumes and time of extraction. The clean-up procedures were optimized using different solid phase extraction cartridges and different eluants. The chromatographic separation was achieved in reversed phase using a gradient of 0. 1 % formic acid in water and acetonitrile, whereas the MS detection was performed in negative electrospray ionization (ESI) for all the analytes, except for the robenidine. The developed method has been validated according to Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /CE.

40|$|Coccidiostats are {{the only}} {{veterinary}} drugs still permitted {{to be used as}} feed additives to treat poultry for coccidiosis. To protect consumers, maximum levels for their presence in food and feed have been set by the European Union (EU). To monitor these coccidiostats, a rapid and inexpensive screening method would be a useful tool. The development of such a screening method, using a flow cytometry-based immunoassay, is described. The assay uses five sets of colour-coded paramagnetic microspheres for the detection of six selected priority coccidiostats. Different coccidiostats, with and without carrier proteins, were covalently coupled onto different bead sets and tested in combination with polyclonal antisera and with a fluorescent-labelled secondary antibody. The five optimal combinations were selected for this multiplex and a simple-to-use sample extraction method was applied for screening blank and spiked eggs and feed samples. A very good correlation (r ranging from 0. 995 to 0. 999) was obtained with the responses obtained in two different flow cytometers (Luminex 100 and FLEXMAP 3 D). The sensitivities obtained were in accordance with the levels set by the EU as the measured limits of detection for narasin/salinomycin, lasalocid, <b>diclazuril,</b> nicarbazin (4, 4 '-dinitrocarbanilide) and monensin in eggs were 0. 01, 0. 1, 0. 5, 53 and 0. 1 µg/kg and in feed 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 3, 9 and 1. 5 µg/kg, respectively...|$|E
