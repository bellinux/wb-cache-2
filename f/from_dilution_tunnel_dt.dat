40|$|The {{regulation}} of particle number {{has been introduced}} in the Euro 5 / 6 light duty vehicle legislation, {{as a result of}} the light duty inter-laboratory exercise of the Particle Measurement Programme (PMP). The heavy duty inter-laboratory exercise investigates whether the same or a similar procedure can be applied to the heavy duty regulation. In the heavy duty exercise two ¿golden¿ systems sample simultaneously; the first <b>from</b> the full <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> and the second from the partial flow system of each lab. One of the targets of the exercise is to compare the full flow and the partial flow system results. In this study we follow a different approach to compare the particle number emissions: We use a PMP compliant system at different positions (full flow, partial flow and tailpipe) and we compare its emissions with a ¿reference¿ system always sampling from the full flow <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel.</b> The results <b>from</b> two heavy duty diesel engines equipped with Diesel Particulate Filters (DPFs) show that full flow and partial flow systems emissions have negligible differences (23 nm but depending on the engine, they are 70 - 500 % higher.

40|$|This {{document}} {{reports the}} results of measurements conducted at the VELA- 2 laboratories of the JRC in February 2007. The aim of the experimental campaign was to provide the necessary experimental data to model aerosol processes from the vehicle¿s exhaust tailpipe to the sampling point at the full <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel.</b> The measurements included particle and temperature profiles at the tailpipe, {{at the end of}} the exhaust gas transfer tube to the <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> (anaconda), at the diaphragm of the <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel,</b> 1, 5 tunnel diameters downstream the diaphragm and 10 tunnel diameters downstream the diaphragm (normal sampling point). Two steady state speeds were used (50 and 120 km/h) and flow rates at the <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> of 6 and 12 m 3 /min. Non-volatile and total particle number and mass concentrations were measured according to the protocol of the Particulate Measurement Programme. The results showed that the main changes of particle number distributions are observed along the transfer tube from the tailpipe to the <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> (anaconda).

40|$|There are {{two main}} ways of {{measuring}} particle emission from wood combustion. Firstly, particles can be sampled directly in the chimney. Secondly, a <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> can be used, thus cooling the flue gases parallel to diluting. The purpose of this work is to investigate the differences between both measurements and establish {{which is the best}} method to measure particle emission from wood combustion. The approach is to perform particle emission measurements in the chimney and in a <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> simultaneously during the combustion of wood in a small-scale appliance. Moreover, Flame Ionization Analysis will be carried out to understand the contribution of condensed organic compounds to the total particulate matter emission. The particle emission measured in the <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> was between 5 and 12 times higher than in the chimney. The more unfavourable combustion conditions, the larger the difference between both measurements was seen. The results also show a factor of about 2, 5 between both particle emission measured in the stack and Total Hydrocarbon content in the flue gas and particle emission measured in the <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel,</b> indicating that about 35 % of the hydrocarbons measured in the stack with the Flame Ionization Detector condense along the <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> accounting for approximately 85 % of the total particle emission found at this location. </p...|$|R
40|$|Recently, a {{particle}} number (PN) limit {{was introduced in}} the European light-duty vehicles legislation. The legislation requires measurement of PN, and particulate mass (PM), <b>from</b> the full <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> with constant volume sampling (CVS). Furthermore, PN measurements will be introduced in the next stage of the European Heavy-Duty regulation. Heavy-duty engine certification can be done either from the CVS or from a partial flow dilution system (PFDS). For research and development purposes, though, measurements are often conducted from the raw exhaust, thereby avoiding the high installation costs of CVS and PFDS. Although for legislative measurements requirements exist regarding sampling and transport of the aerosol sample, such requirements do not necessarily apply for raw exhaust measurements. Thus, measurement differences are often observed depending on where in the experimental set up sampling occurs. The objective {{of this paper is to}} summarize and discuss particle loss mechanisms. Simple equations are given for the most important mechanisms. Topics like isokinetic sampling and agglomeration are discussed for various typical cases. Special emphasis is placed on thermophoretic losses since thermophoresis is the most important particle removal mechanism for raw exhaust sampling from modern engines. Sampling from high pressure exhaust gas is also mentioned, and comparisons of the effect of tubing materials on particle removal are carried out. Finally, expected losses for typical cases are shown.

This paper aims to evaluate a new measurement system that could potentially be adapted later to allow a much wider examination of particulate production from port fuel injection engines relative to gasoline direct-injection engines. This work presents the morphology of the particles emitted from port fuel injection engines analysed using scanning transmission electron microscopy. The current designs of <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> used in particle morphology measurements were reviewed, and subsequently a new <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> was designed, built, tested and optimised for nanoparticle measurements from port fuel injection engines. A new methodology for capturing nanoparticles from port fuel injection engines for morphological analysis by transmission electron microscopy was investigated by integrating a nanoparticle impactor with a <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel.</b> The performance of the <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> demonstrated that it integrated very well with the impactor and achieved the targets {{in terms of the}} flow rate and the temperature.

40|$|With the {{promulgation}} {{of the new}} National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for PM 2. 5 in 1997, {{the measurement}} of fine particulate matter from stationary sources becomes more important. A series of tests have been performed on three different natural and refinery gas-fired sources using traditional manual methods (in-stack cyclones and filter with iced-impinger train) and <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> sampling. The <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> mixes stack emissions with cleaned ambient air, cooling and diluting them to simulate {{what happens in the}} plume as emissions leave the stack. This type of sampling allows for extensive speciation of the PM 2. 5 fraction including elements, ions, organic and elemental carbon, semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). One result of particular interest is the low percentage of organic carbon (OC) accounted for by the SVOC results. At all locations, the sum of the SVOCs was less than 10 percent of the total OC measured using the <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel.</b> <b>Dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> sampling is able to provide a more complete speciation of SVOCs, however this large discrepancy indicates that further investigation is needed. Differences in organic aerosol emissions from natural gas versus refinery gas combustion have also been observed.

The results confirmed the findings of Phase I: Diffusion Charging (DC) based systems are a feasible option to measure PN and thermal pre-treatment is necessary to avoid volatile artefacts. At least two of the DC based PN-PEMS showed good agreement with the reference PMP system (# 1, # 3). A third one (# 4) also had very good behaviour, but higher scatter. The best performing PN-PEMS had differences from the reference instrument at the tailpipe within - 25 % and + 30 % with a scatter of 20 % [...] The differences from the reference system at the <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> were within - 35 % and + 50 % (scatter 25 %) (including all technologies tested); slightly higher due to the particle transformation processes that take place between the tailpipe and the <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel,</b> exhaust flow accuracy and time alignment. It was also shown that a well calibrated PN-PEMS can cover a wide range of engine technologies with similar differences to the reference system. Based on the experimental data new PN-PEMS efficiencies were recommended for the technical requirements. The CPC based PN-PEMS had issues (prototypes). However, one CPC based PN-PEMS, which arrived late in the program, had behaviour equivalent to the reference systems and better real time comparability with the reference systems compared to the DC based systems.

The presence of 3 nm of tunnel oxides allows the injection of the charge by direct <b>tunnel</b> (<b>DT)</b> using low voltages for both program and erase operations. The charge stored in the quantum dots is able to produce a well-detectable flat band shift in the capacitors or, equivalently, a threshold voltage shift in the transistors.

40|$|We study, {{experimentally}} and theoretically, {{the dynamics}} of non-volatile particles emitted from a diesel EURO 3 light-duty vehicle along the transfer tube that conducts exhaust fumes from the tailpipe to the <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Particle agglomeration, diffusional and thermophoretic transport are modeled. For turbulent, but moderate, Reynolds numbers and under steady-state conditions we map the combustion-generated nanoparticle dynamics onto an one-dimensional dynamics of aerosol particles in an ageing chamber. The aggregate fractal dimension, determined self-consistently by comparing mass distributions, varied from 2 to 2. 3. The relative importance of aerosol processes is estimated by defining appropriate characteristic time scales.

40|$|Diesel exhaust {{particulates}} are {{the subject}} of increasingly severe legislation controlling mass emissions throughout the world. Other emissions, which are currently unregulated, are also receiving closer scrutiny. In particular, polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC), some of which are known carcinogens, are being studied. A total exhaust solvent scrubbing apparatus (TESSA) has been constructed to sample diesel exhaust hydrocarbons, using a solvent mixture to strip organic compounds from exhaust gases. This avoided adsorption of hydrocarbons onto particulates, when fitted close to the exhaust port, and minimised the formation of sampling artifacts. TESSA yielded new information, enabling lighter more volatile organics such as 2 - and 3 -ringed PAC to be characterised, these could not be collected by a <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> filter, which trapped particulates effectively but did not sample the hydrocarbons which had remained in the gas-phase. TESSA has proved itself to be uniquely suitable for the sampling of gaseous hydrocarbons with which there is currently an increased interest. Experiments using TESSA have confirmed that there is a contribution to the exhaust from small amounts of fuel passing through the combustion chamber substantially unchanged, as well as from partially burnt or pyrolysed products of combustion. New techniques have been developed to aid the interpretation of data obtained from high resolution gas chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, in order to assess the origin of specific groups of compounds within the highly complex samples obtained from diesel exhaust. Naphthalene and phenanthrene were shown to increase their concentration relative to their alkylated derivatives in an exhaust sample when compared to the relative concentrations found in the fuel. These parent compounds were being formed within the combustion chamber, as well as surviving in unburnt fuel. Nitro-PAC were detected only at considerably lower concentrations than had previously been found on <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> filter samples. Two new methods for assessing the contribution of lubricating oil to diesel exhaust emissions have been developed, and involved matching common peaks in a sample and a lubricating oil standard. The results demonstrated that lubricating oil makes a significant contribution to the total particulates. Increased control of lubricating oil leakage to the exhaust would help to reduce particulate emissions to below the new stringent limits. Perkins Engineering, Peterboroug...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{investigates the}} concept of {{trademark}} dilution under international and regional trademark law, and under the laws of selected jurisdictions; namely, the United States of America, Germany, the United Kingdom and the Republic of South Africa. The investigation includes measures undertaken to prohibit the internet-based dilution of famous marks through the registration of confusingly similar domain names. It is noted that dilution is imprecisely formulated under international trademark treaty law. In fact, the term "dilution" {{does not appear in}} international trademark treaties. To fill the gap of international trademark treaties, various policy initiatives, or `soft law' have been developed, which to some extent clarify both {{the concept of}} dilution, the type of mark protected <b>from</b> <b>dilution,</b> and the scope of such protection. The problem is that the policy initiatives are non-binding on States, so that different States have adopted different common law and statutory approaches to the protection of marks against dilution. This is demonstrated, for example, {{by the fact that the}} European Union and its Member States provide protection <b>from</b> <b>dilution</b> to "marks with a reputation", while the United States of America provides such protection only to "famous" marks, and the Republic of South Africa protects "marks which are well-known in the Republic" <b>from</b> <b>dilution.</b> The thesis analyses the protection granted in these jurisdictions, to determine the similarities and differences of approach, and to make appropriate law reform proposals to achieve uniformity of protection.

In {{the first year of}} the program West Virginia University (WVU) researchers determined that a transportable chassis dynamometer emissions measurement approach was required so that fleets of trucks and buses did not need to be ferried across the nation to a fixed facility. A Transportable Heavy-Duty Vehicle Emissions Testing Laboratory (Translab) was designed, constructed and verified. This laboratory consisted of a chassis dynamometer semi-trailer and an analytic trailer housing a full scale exhaust <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> and sampling system which mimicked closely the system described in the Code of Federal Regulations for engine certification. The Translab was first used to quantify emissions from natural gas and methanol fueled transit buses, and a second Translab unit was constructed to satisfy research demand. Subsequent emissions measurement was performed on trucks and buses using ethanol, Fischer-Tropsch fuel, and biodiesel. A medium-duty chassis dynamometer was also designed and constructed to facilitate research on delivery vehicles in the 10, 000 to 20, 000 lb range. The Translab participated in major programs to evaluate low-sulfur diesel in conjunction with passively regenerating exhaust particulate filtration technology, and substantial reductions in particulate matter were recorded. The researchers also participated in programs to evaluate emissions from advanced natural gas engines with closed loop feedback control. These natural gas engines showed substantially reduced levels of oxides of nitrogen. For all of the trucks and buses characterized, the levels of carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide and particulate matter were quantified, and in many cases non-regulated species such as aldehydes were also sampled. Particle size was also quantified during selected studies. A laboratory was established at WVU to provide for studies which supported and augmented the Translab research, and to provide for development of superior emissions measurement systems. This laboratory research focused on engine control and fuel sulfur issues. In recent years, as engine and aftertreatment technologies advanced, emissions levels were reduced such that they were at or below the Translab detectable limits, and in the same time frame the US Environmental Protection Agency required improved measurement methodologies for engine emissions certification. To remain current and relevant, the researchers designed a new Translab analytic system, housed in a container which can be transported on a semi-trailer. The new system's <b>dilution</b> <b>tunnel</b> flow was designed to use a subsonic venturi with closed loop control of blower speed, and the secondary dilution and particulate matter filter capture were designed to follow new EPA engine certification procedures. A further contribution of the program has been the development of techniques for creating heavy-duty vehicle test schedules, and the creation of schedules to mimic a variety of truck and bus vocations...|$|R
5000|$|Lately, the Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2006 (H.R. 683), {{was signed}} into law, which {{overturned}} Moseley v.

The new law revises the FTDA {{so that the}} plaintiff only needs to show the defendant's mark is likely to cause dilution.
