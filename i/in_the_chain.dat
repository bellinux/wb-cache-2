5|$|Chrysippus {{also argued}} for the {{existence}} of fate based on divination, which he thought there was good evidence for. It would not be possible for diviners to predict the future if the future itself was accidental. Omens and portents, he believed, are the natural symptoms of certain occurrences. There must be countless indications of the course of providence, for the most part unobserved, the meaning of only a few having become known to humanity. To those who argued that divination was superfluous as all events are foreordained, he replied that both divination and our behaviour under the warnings which it affords are included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> of causation.|$|E

5|$|In 1962, Khrushchev divided oblast (province) level Party {{committees}} {{into two}} parallel structures, one for industry {{and one for}} agriculture. This was unpopular among Party apparatchiks, and led to confusions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> of command, as neither committee secretary had precedence over the other. As there were limited numbers of Central Committee seats from each oblast, the division set up the possibility of rivalry for office between factions, and, according to Medvedev, had the potential for beginning a two-party system. Khrushchev also ordered that one-third of the membership of each committee, from low-level councils to the Central Committee itself, be replaced at each election. This decree created tension between Khrushchev and the Central Committee and upset the party leaders upon whose support Khrushchev had risen to power.|$|E

The island of Hawaii is comprised by five volcanoes, of which two (Kilauea and Mauna Loa) are still active.

It is also possible that a collision near the Aleutian Trench had changed the velocity of the Pacific Plate, explaining the hotspot chain's bend; the relationship between these features is still being investigated.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the large}} shift, {{the change in}} {{direction}} was never recorded by magnetic declinations, fracture zone orientations or plate reconstructions; nor could a continental collision have occurred fast enough to produce such a pronounced bend <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chain.</b> To test {{whether or not the}} bend was a result of a change in direction of the Pacific Plate, scientists analyzed the lava samples' geochemistry to determine where and when they formed. Age was determined by the radiometric dating of radioactive isotopes of potassium and argon. Researchers estimated that the volcanoes formed during a period 81 million to 45 million years ago. Tarduno and his team determined where the volcanoes formed by analyzing the rock for the magnetic mineral magnetite. While hot lava from a volcanic eruption cools, tiny grains within the magnetite align with the Earth's magnetic field, and lock in place once the rock solidifies. Researchers were able to verify the latitudes at which the volcanoes formed by measuring the grains' orientation within the magnetite. Paleomagnetists concluded that the Hawaiian hotspot had drifted southward sometime in its history, and that, 47 million years ago, the hotspot's southward motion greatly slowed, perhaps even stopping entirely.|$|E

In 1831, just before Duyet's death, Minh Mạng began to dismantle his military infrastructure and sending his component units to other parts of Vietnam, and sent a loyalist General Nguyen Van Khue to Gia Định, allowing him to dilute the viceroy's power.

40|$|Background: Due to {{the rapidly}} {{changing}} needs of {{suppliers and customers}} classic methods of lot sizing do not work. Meanwhile, the target for logistics remains all the time the same: to realize the flow of materials <b>in</b> <b>the</b> supply <b>chain</b> as efficiently as possible. Today, efficiency is understood as the sum of two components: the effectiveness - understood as the degree of achieving the objective (i. e.   customer service level indicator) and efficiency - understood {{as a way to}} achieve the objective, (i. e. total cost of <b>the</b> material flow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> supply <b>chain).</b> Simulation studies developed by authors was focused on the identification and analysis of both global and local conditions, the efficiency of material flow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> supply <b>chain.</b> 	Methods: Simulation of material flow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> supply <b>chain</b> was carried out using <b>the</b> spreadsheet. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> analysis of results, statistical software Minitab 17 was used. Using correlation analysis examined the relationship between the cost of the material flow and the realized customer service level. On the base of methods ANOVA and Tukey Pairwise Comparisons determined whether there is a statistically significant relationship between <b>the</b> lot size <b>in</b> flow between companies <b>in</b> supply <b>chain</b> and <b>the</b> cost of that flow through <b>the</b> whole <b>chain.</b> 	Results: <b>The</b> objective of the article is to identify the relations between the material flow lot size between particular companies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> supply <b>chain</b> and <b>the</b> flow costs and to identify <b>the</b> link <b>in</b> <b>the</b> supply <b>chain</b> that has <b>the</b> greatest impact on the customer service level and the flow total costs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> supply <b>chain.</b> Distribution of demand (category of goods) has an impact on the cost of <b>the</b> material flow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> supply <b>chain.</b> <b>In</b> both analysed distributions of demand (normal and exponential) was observed relationships proportional (what is beneficial for <b>the</b> whole supply <b>chain</b> is also beneficial to <b>the</b> each company <b>in</b> supply chain) as well as the relationship inversely proportional (that which is beneficial to <b>the</b> whole supply <b>chain</b> is bad for one of <b>the</b> companies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> supply <b>chain</b> or what is bad for <b>the</b> whole supply <b>chain</b> is beneficial to one of <b>the</b> companies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> supply <b>chain).</b> Regardless of <b>the</b> demand distribution, lot size in distribution phase has the greatest impact on cost of material flow in supply chain. 	Conclusions: Distribution of demand is crucial in lot sizing in material flow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> supply <b>chain.</b> According to conducted research, it is possible to identify company, which has a crucial impact on the effectiveness and efficiency of material flow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> supply <b>chain.</b> <b>The</b> study shows {{that it is possible to}} indicate <b>the</b> global optimum <b>in</b> <b>the</b> supply <b>chain.</b> Usually, <b>the</b> global optimum is not the sum of local optima of material flow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> whole supply <b>chain...</b>|$|R
