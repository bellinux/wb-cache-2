25|$|Then black teas are {{processed}} {{in either of}} two ways, CTC (Crush, Tear, Curl) or orthodox. The CTC method produces leaves of <b>fannings</b> or dust grades that are commonly used in tea bags but also produces higher (broken leaf) grades such as BOP CTC and GFBOP CTC (see gradings below for more details). This method is efficient and effective for producing a better quality product from medium and lower quality leaves of consistently dark color. Orthodox processing is done either by machines or by hand. Hand processing is used for high quality teas. While the methods employed in orthodox processing differ by tea type, this style of processing results in the high quality loose tea sought by many connoisseurs. The tea leaves are allowed to completely oxidize.|$|E
2500|$|Black tea {{is usually}} graded {{on one of}} four scales of quality. Whole-leaf teas are the highest quality, with the best whole-leaf teas graded as [...] "orange pekoe." [...] After the whole-leaf teas, the scale degrades to broken leaves, <b>fannings,</b> then dusts. Whole-leaf teas are {{produced}} {{with little or no}} alteration to the tea leaf. This results in a finished product with a coarser texture than that of bagged teas. Whole-leaf teas are widely considered the most valuable, especially if they contain leaf tips. Broken leaves are commonly sold as medium-grade loose teas. Smaller broken varieties may be included in tea bags. <b>Fannings</b> are usually small particles of tea left over from the production of larger tea varieties, but are occasionally manufactured specifically for use in bagged teas. Dusts are the finest particles of tea left over from production of the above varieties, and are often used for tea bags with very fast and harsh brews. <b>Fannings</b> and dusts are useful in bagged teas because the greater surface area of the many particles allows for a fast, complete diffusion of the tea into the water. <b>Fannings</b> and dusts usually have a darker colour, lack of sweetness, and stronger flavor when brewed.|$|E
2500|$|Finally, {{the leaves}} are [...] sorted into grades {{according}} to their sizes (whole leaf, brokens, <b>fannings</b> and dust), usually {{with the use of}} sieves. The tea could be further sub-graded according to other criteria.|$|E
