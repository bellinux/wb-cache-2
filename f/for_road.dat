5|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{terrorist}} attacks in Paris on the Friday evening of the race weekend, Formula One decided to honour the victims with all drivers wearing black armbands during the parade lap on race day as well as the French tricolore being displayed on the truck that took the drivers around the track. French driver Romain Grosjean had already worn an armband with the flag of his country during Saturday's sessions. However, a long planned minute of silence for the World Day of Remembrance <b>for</b> <b>Road</b> Traffic Victims was upheld and plans to dedicate the salute to the Paris attacks discarded.|$|E

5|$|The AdelaideMannum {{pipeline}} {{crosses the}} park and the Anstey Hill water filtration plant lies on its southern boundary; together they supply 20% of Adelaide's reticulated water. Significant historical uses of the area are preserved as ruins and highlighted with interpretive signs. The ruins of Newman's Nursery are {{all that remains of}} what was once the largest plant nursery in the Southern Hemisphere. Ellis Cottage is one of the earliest homes in the area, and the Rumps Bakery building housed the first bakery in Tea Tree Gully. Quarries supplied stone for significant Victorian buildings in Adelaide and aggregate <b>for</b> <b>road</b> building.

5|$|The {{city council}} {{voted in favor}} of {{building}} the Ring Line on 25 June 1997, against the votes of the Progress Party.

Construction started in June, with the Agency <b>for</b> <b>Road</b> and Transport of the municipality responsible for construction. The first section opened from Ullevål stadion via Nydalen to Storo on 20 August 2003. With the opening, and Line 4 was extended from Ullevål stadion to Storo. On 20 August 2006, the final section opened, from Storo via Sinsen to Carl Berners plass.|$|E
5|$|The cromlech was {{discovered}} in 1869 by workmen digging <b>for</b> <b>road</b> stone. An excavation later that year revealed human bones (now known to have belonged to at least 40 people), animal remains, and Neolithic pottery. Samples from the site show the tomb {{to have been in}} use for between 300 and 800years. North-West European lifestyles changed around 6000 BP, from the nomadic lives of the hunter-gatherer, to a settled life of agricultural farming: the Neolithic Revolution. However, analysis of the human remains found at Parc Cwm long cairn show the people interred in the cromlech continued to be either hunter-gatherers or herders, rather than agricultural farmers.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) are derived from a {{forecast}} by city planners in 1967 which stated {{the need for a}} rail-based urban transport system by 1992. Following a debate on whether a bus-only system would be more cost-effective, then Minister for Communications Ong Teng Cheong, {{came to the conclusion that}} an all-bus system would be inadequate, as it would have to compete <b>for</b> <b>road</b> space in a land-scarce country.|$|E
5|$|The tomb {{was first}} opened around 1760 {{by a local}} farmer to obtain stone <b>for</b> <b>road</b> building. The site was {{excavated}} by John Skinner and Richard Hoare in 1816-17, who gained the entry through the hole which was made previously. The excavation revealed the bones (some burned) of several individuals. The mound was restored in 1858 by Thomas Joliffe. Some of the artefacts from the excavations are in the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery.|$|E

Military roads debuted in 1816 with the construction of the Detroit–Fort Meigs Road to Toledo as a response to transportation needs. More roads were built with Congressional appropriations in the 1820s and 1830s connecting Detroit to Port Huron, Saginaw, Grand Rapids and Chicago.|$|E

5|$|Transport between islands is {{primarily}} by ferry, and Shetland Islands Council operates various inter-island services. Shetland is also {{served by a}} domestic connection from Lerwick to Aberdeen on mainland Scotland. This service, which takes about 12 hours, is operated by NorthLink Ferries. Some services also call at Kirkwall, Orkney, which increases the journey time between Aberdeen and Lerwick by 2 hours. There are plans <b>for</b> <b>road</b> tunnels {{to some of the}} islands, especially Bressay and Whalsay, however it is hard to convince the mainland government to finance them.|$|E
5|$|While Britain's {{seafaring}} {{and trading}} concerns ensured {{the spread of}} cricket overseas, at home it relied heavily on ease of transport and communications, most of these being waterborne as long journeys tended to be undertaken using coastal or river vessels. Road transport was slowly improving and, in 1706, Parliament established the first turnpike trusts that placed a length of road {{under the control of}} trustees drawn from local landowners and traders. The turnpike trusts borrowed capital <b>for</b> <b>road</b> maintenance against the security of tolls. This arrangement became the common method of road maintenance for the next 150 years and came in time to assist the spread of cricket throughout Britain.|$|E
5|$|A {{major benefit}} of {{biodiesel}} is lower carbon emissions, although the energy balance of liquid biofuels {{is a matter}} of controversy. Research is being undertaken into converting rapeseed oil into biodiesel, and the European biofuels directive intended to ensure that 5.75% Europe's transport fuel came from renewable sources by 2010. There is only enough used vegetable oil in the UK to contribute 0.38% of current road fuel demand and if all the arable land in the UK were turned over to biofuel crops this would still only satisfy 22% of the existing requirement <b>for</b> <b>road</b> transport. Serious concerns regarding the ethics of growing biodiesel in developing countries and importing the fuel to Europe have been raised {{on the grounds that they}} may replace much needed food crops. Converting any mainstream transport system to a renewable one also involves the conundrum that for consumers to use it the infrastructure must be in place, but high levels of use may be required to finance the infrastructure. Developments are thus slow at present and renewably powered vehicles very much the exception.|$|E
