5|$|When {{plans for}} Runcorn New Town were drawn up, they {{included}} three distinct types of road: local roads, expressways and the Busway. The expressways {{are intended to}} keep all through traffic off the local roads. This system links to the north by the A533 over the Silver Jubilee Bridge to Widnes and Merseyside, to the northeast to Warrington by the A56, to the east to Northwich and north Cheshire by the A533, and to the southeast by the A557 to the M56 and to Frodsham. The M56 links to the M6 and, {{to the north of}} Widnes, the A557 links to the M62. The Busway is a system of roads for use by buses only, and bears no resemblance to guided busways or bus lanes in use elsewhere, as it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>totally</b> separate road system, not running alongside (or down the middle of) existing roads. In addition, there is a network of dedicated cycleways in the town.|$|E

The P-V diagram of the reversed Carnot cycle {{is the same as}} for the Carnot cycle except that the directions of the processes are reversed.|$|E

[...] Author Peter Lavezzoli has commented that [...] "Why" [...] features verses with a chord structure reminiscent of [...] "(Love Is Like a) Heat Wave" [...] by Martha and the Vandellas and a raga-flavored lead guitar solo inspired by the music of sitarist Ravi Shankar. [...] However, Rogan has noted that the song's Indian classical music influences were considerably watered down on the re-recorded version that appeared on Younger Than Yesterday when compared to the earlier B-side recording.|$|E

[...] Lyrically, [...] "Say Somethin'" [...] recalls an encounter in which a male expresses interest in having a sexual affair in a bathroom with a female, while she agrees and responds [...] "If its worth you're while / Say somethin' good to me". In an interview with Newsweek, Carey described how she felt regarding the song: [...] "You're right. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>totally</b> different approach for me musically.
