5|$|In 1481 {{two local}} men, Thomas Croft and John Jay, sent off ships {{looking for the}} mythical island of Hy-Brasil. There {{was no mention of}} the island being {{discovered}} but Croft was prosecuted for illegal exports of salt, on the grounds that, as a customs officer, <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> engaged in trade. Professor David Beers Quinn, whose theories form the basis for a variety of popular histories, suggested that the explorers may have discovered the Grand Banks off Newfoundland, waters rich in cod.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the cast}} and writers of TGS are {{preparing}} their annual Ludachristmas party in the writer's room. Tracy is annoyed because {{he is unable to}} attend due to a recent order from a courtroom judge which requires him to wear an alcohol monitoring ankle bracelet. Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) is also annoyed because he believes that none of the staff know what the true meaning of Christmas is. He cancels Ludachristmas and makes the staff sit through a talk, led by himself and Reverend Gary (John F Mooney), about the meaning of Christmas. This inspires {{the cast and}} writers to run outside of 30 Rock and tear down the big Christmas tree which is outside the building. Kenneth eventually stops their efforts and Tracy reveals that he has been drinking alcohol when <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been.|$|E

He also eventually kills the Minister Janardhanan (Vijayan), {{who is responsible for}} all the wrongdoings. After that, Advocate Sukran himself surrenders to the Chennai Police, stating that even though the minister was a Pervert, <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> done the murder in front of the Judge.|$|R

5|$|The main feud {{heading into}} the event on Raw was between WWE Champion John Cena and The Great Khali. This was a rematch of their {{encounter}} at Judgment Day, the pay-per-view two weeks before One Night Stand. At the event, Cena defeated Khali by forcing him {{to submit to the}} STFU. When Khali submitted to the STFU, however, his feet were underneath the bottom rope, meaning Cena should have broken the submission hold. Referee Mike Chioda was focusing on Khali's arm and did not see Khali's feet underneath the bottom rope. The following night on Raw, believing <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> lost the match, Khali challenged Cena to a Pinfalls Count Anywhere match. After Cena's acceptance, Khali Chokeslamed Cena. Heading into One Night Stand, Khali Chokebombed Cena again to win a non-title match against Cena on the June 2 episode of Saturday Night's Main Event.|$|E
25|$|The {{historian}} Pei Songzhi criticised Man Chong for his {{cruelty and}} said that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> tortured Yang Biao, who {{had a reputation for}} being virtuous. From his viewpoint, even though Man Chong deserved praise for doing things by the book, it was not enough to make up for his cruelty.|$|E
25|$|St-Pierre {{has said}} that he lost the match {{partially}} {{due to a lack of}} focus because of problems in his personal life, including the death of a close cousin and his father's serious illness, and later parted ways with his manager and most of his entourage. St-Pierre has since gone on to say that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> made any excuses and that Serra was simply the better fighter that night.|$|E

25|$|Sallust {{struck out}} {{practically}} {{a new line}} in literature for himself: his predecessors had been little better than mere dry-as-dust chroniclers, but he endeavoured to explain the connection and meaning of events and successfully delineated character. The contrast between his early life and the high moral tone he adopted in his writings has frequently made him a subject of reproach, but history gives no reason why <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> reformed.|$|E
25|$|With {{the team}} in the Premier League, {{there was a need}} to rebuild the team. Oxford United player Joey Beauchamp was {{recruited}} for a fee of £1.2 million. Shortly after arriving at the club, he complained that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> made the move, as it was too far from his Oxford home. Bonds found this attitude hard to understand compared with his own committed, never-say-die style. This was the first evidence of his losing appetite for the modern game and modern player. Fifty-eight days later, Beauchamp was signed by Swindon Town for a club-record combined fee of £800,000, which included defender Adrian Whitbread going in the opposite direction. Whitbread was valued at £750,000.|$|E
25|$|Like his renowned British tenor {{predecessors}} Sims Reeves and Edward Lloyd, Coates had a famously protective wife. Moore {{refers to}} Coates' home life as serene, with an adorable spouse, sons and daughters; but he thought, despite Coates's good humour, {{he was not}} a happy person because he {{was too much of a}} worrier. Coates developed financial headaches, too. He wasted a good deal of money in a legal case that he launched against the Performing Right Society, in which he argued that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> to pay a royalty to perform music in public which had been brought to him in manuscript, and which therefore, by agreeing to sing it, Coates had encouraged the publishers to publish. He lost the case, and it preyed on his mind and finances for long after, though he refused offers of financial support from other singers. In his last years he thought of going back on the stage and started to slim, but he was seized with anaemia and became permanently confined to bed, frustrated at being unable to assist his country as the Second World War took hold. In July 1940, Gerald Moore presented a half-hour broadcast in tribute to their work together, and received a last letter from him in friendship and gratitude.|$|E

25|$|Alec Bedser {{dominated}} the England bowling (and the Australian batsmen) {{as much as}} Len Hutton did the batting {{and by the end}} of the tour the Australians rated him the best new-ball bowler in the world. He sent down almost twice as many overs as anybody else in the Tests and took 30 wickets (16.06), including 10/105 in England's final victory at Melbourne. Bedser carried the England bowling on his broad back against in the 1940s and 1950s with a long list of short-term new-ball partners. His huge hands and powerful shoulders allowed him to bowl a lethal combination of in-swingers and leg-cutters off a short run-up and only Keith Miller - briefly - was able to cut loose from his control. In 1950-51 series he did have the support of his captain Freddie Brown, another big medium paced bowler, who surprised everybody by taking 18 wickets (21.61) despite celebrating his 40th birthday on the tour. There was also Trevor Bailey who took 14 wickets (14.14) with his naggingly accurate out-swingers that mirrored his monotonous batting as he settled on containing batsmen, but could be dangerous in the right conditions. After these three the quality of the England bowling dropped dramatically, for which the selectors must bear the brunt of the blame. Doug Wright was a mercurial leg-spinner who the MCC liked sent on tour instead of Jim Laker because he was more suited to the harder wickets abroad. He was potential match-winner, but he liked to buy his wickets and asking him to bowl was always a gamble as he could equally snap up a few quick wickets, concede a slew of runs, or both. Eric Hollies bowled one of the most famous balls in cricket when his googly dismissed Don Bradman for a duck in his last Test innings, but the Warwickshire leg-spinner was not a great turner of the ball, instead relying on line and length. Unfortunately the 1950-51 tour was the first to use extensive air travel. Hollies was scared stiff of flying and had to be drunk before he could get on a plane. He failed to turn the ball on Australian wickets and was kept out of the team by Wright. Roy Tattersall and Bob Berry were off-spinners who were supposed to tie down the Australian batsmen, but like many of their kind failed to adjust to the faster, harder Australian pitches. John Warr quickly proved himself to be the worst player in the team, he took only one test wicket - for 281 runs - when Ian Johnson walked after the umpire declined to give him out, an almost unheard of practice in Australia at the time. He improved his game during the tour, but was never more than a decent county bowler. Let loose from the hard life at Yorkshire and the Army Brian Close was undisciplined and failed on a tour for which <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been chosen.|$|E
500|$|In a Salon article, Krohn was {{critical}} of partisan politics in general, and conservatives in particular, describing his conservative critics as [...] "scorned right-wingers showing all the maturity of a little boy."

Michael then joins Sawyer on the pontoon, and when the morning breaks, he cries, realizing that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> brought Walt with him on the raft, and blames himself for his son's kidnapping. At this point, Sawyer notices that they are back near the island. When they wash ashore, they meet Jin running toward them, hands tied behind his back, shouting the word [...] "Others", and fleeing a group holding him captive.|$|E
500|$|Among the precepts which Itanhaém and Friar Pedro Mariana {{sought to}} instill in Pedro II were: that all human beings should be {{considered}} as his equals, that he should seek to be impartial and just, that public servants and ministers of state should be carefully watched, that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> favourites, and that his concern should always be for the public welfare. Both had as an objective [...] "to make a human, honest, constitutional, pacifist, tolerant, wise and just monarch. That is, a perfect ruler, dedicated integrally to his obligations, above political passions and private interests." [...] Later, in January 1839, Itanhaém called Cândido José de Araújo Viana (later Marquis of Sapucaí) to be instructor of Pedro II's education, and he and the emperor also got on very well.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Ebert {{opined that}} video games are not art, and are {{inferior}} to media created through authorial control, such as film and literature, stating, [...] "video games can be elegant, subtle, sophisticated, challenging and visually wonderful", but [...] "the {{nature of the}} medium prevents it from moving beyond craftsmanship to the stature of art". This resulted in negative reaction from video game enthusiasts, such as writer Clive Barker, who defended video games as an art form. Ebert wrote a further piece in response to Barker. Ebert maintained his position in 2010, but conceded that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> expressed this skepticism without being {{more familiar with the}} actual experience of playing them. He admitted that he barely played video games: [...] "I have played Cosmology of Kyoto which I enormously enjoyed, and Myst for which I lacked the patience." ...|$|E

500|$|Following {{the media}} frenzy about details of Hageman's offence, two contestants {{that had not}} yet {{appeared}} on the show were removed by ITV. It was revealed that one had failed to disclose that he had a criminal record during the application process, while information on the second contestant was withheld. A third contestant was subsequently removed by ITV. Each contestant was from a different night, with the first removed on the programme aired 7 September; however footage pre–filmed revealed his identity. One of the three contestants removed, Ryan Keating, was later interviewed by The People, which revealed that he received a 12–month community order and £50 fine in 2008 after he got into a drunken altercation with his wife. He argued that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been removed from the show, saying that he [...] "was honest with them from the outset. I've been totally on the level.
