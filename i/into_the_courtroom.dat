5|$|Kinne's {{second trial}} {{for the murder of}} James Kinne began on March 23, 1964. As jury {{selection}} got underway that day, the public was initially barred from the proceedings, but the restriction was soon loosened and the media were allowed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom.</b> An unusually long jury selection process made {{the first day of the}} trial last fourteen hours, beginning at 9 a.m. and not ending until nearly midnight the same day; presiding judge Paul Carver noted that due to the notoriety of the case, he had been forced to choose between sequestering the entire jury pool overnight and forcing the court into a long day. The eventual jury, all men, were immediately sequestered, but days later, a mistrial was declared after it emerged that a law partner of prosecutor Lawrence Gepford had once been retained by one of the jurors.|$|E

Designs for <b>the</b> <b>courtrooms</b> were partly based on <b>the</b> <b>courtrooms</b> of <b>the</b> Bordeaux Law Courts in France.

Ito would be later criticized for this decision by other legal professionals. Dershowitz said that he believed that Ito, along with others related to the case (Clark, Fuhrman, Kaelin), was influenced to some degree by the media presence, and the related publicity. The trial was covered in 2,237 news segments from 1994 through 1997.|$|E

In response, Chikatilo simply sat mute. Judge Akubzhanov then announced an initial date of 15 September for himself and the two official jurors to review the evidence and pass final sentence upon Chikatilo. (This date was later postponed until 14 October.) As court announced recess, the brother of Lyudmila Alekseyeva, a 17-year-old girl killed by Chikatilo in August 1984, threw a heavy chunk of metal at Chikatilo, hitting him in the chest. When security tried to arrest the young man, other victims' relatives shielded him.|$|E

Metcalfe said that even if Mercedes and Russ ended their relationship, which they did shortly after she confessed the truth, would not matter because she believed that it would not take Mercedes [...] "long before she goes back to her old ways" [...] because [...] "that's just the type of person she is - Mercedes likes playing the field and having fun, and no man's going to change her" ...|$|E

500|$|Following Wiens's defence statement, El-Sherbini {{testified to}} the court. After El-Sherbini had {{finished}} her testimony, the judge asked whether there were any further questions. Wiens replied and asked why above all El-Sherbini was in Germany. The question {{was rejected by the}} judge; Wiens responded with a further question to which the defence counsel motioned for recess. El-Sherbini was not intending to wait {{until the end of the}} hearing and tried to leave. When she, her husband, and their three-year-old son were at the door, Wiens suddenly attacked El-Sherbini with a kitchen knife with an [...] long blade, which he apparently had taken <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> in a backpack. El-Sherbini received more than 15 stab wounds to the upper body and arm; the attack was carried out in such a forceful and sudden manner that it resulted in a notable absence of defence wounds. While trying to protect his wife, El-Sherbini's husband Okaz was stabbed at least 16 times to the head, neck, upper body and arm. Wiens's defence counsel tried to help El-Sherbini by obstructing Wiens with chairs and a table. The victim's three-year-old son was injured while being ushered to safety.|$|E
500|$|Elizabeth Device {{was charged}} with the murders of James Robinson, John Robinson and, {{together}} with Alice Nutter and Demdike, the murder of Henry Mitton. Elizabeth Device vehemently maintained her innocence. Potts records that [...] "this odious witch" [...] suffered from a facial deformity resulting in her left eye being set lower than her right. The main witness against Device was her daughter, Jennet, who was about nine years old. When Jennet was brought <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> and asked {{to stand up and}} give evidence against her mother, Elizabeth, confronted with her own child making accusations that would lead to her execution, began to curse and scream at her daughter, forcing the judges to have her removed from the courtroom before the evidence could be heard. Jennet was placed on a table and stated that she believed her mother had been a witch for three or four years. She also said her mother had a familiar called Ball, who appeared {{in the shape of a}} brown dog. Jennet claimed to have witnessed conversations between Ball and her mother, in which Ball had been asked to help with various murders. James Device also gave evidence against his mother, saying he had seen her making a clay figure of one of her victims, John Robinson. Elizabeth Device was found guilty.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of May 15, Waco's {{courthouse}} quickly filled to capacity {{in anticipation of the}} trial: the crowd nearly prevented some jurors from entering. Observers also filled the sidewalks around the courthouse; over two thousand spectators were present. Attendees were almost entirely white, but a few quiet members of Waco's black community were present. As Washington was led <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtroom,</b> one audience member pointed a gun at him, but was quickly overpowered. As the trial commenced, the judge attempted to keep order, insisting that the audience remain silent. Jury selection proceeded quickly: the defense did not challenge any selections of the prosecution. Bernstein states that the trial had a [...] "kangaroo-court atmosphere". [...] The judge asked Washington for a plea, and explained the potential sentences. Washington muttered a response, possibly [...] "yes", interpreted by the court as a guilty plea. The prosecution described the charges, and the court heard testimony from law enforcement officers and the doctor who examined Fryer's body. The doctor discussed how Fryer died, but did not mention rape. The prosecution rested, and Washington's attorney asked him whether he had committed the offense. Washington replied, [...] "That's what I done [...] " [...] and quietly apologized. The lead prosecutor addressed the courtroom and declared that the trial had been conducted fairly, prompting an ovation from the crowd. The jury was then sent to deliberate.|$|E
50|$|From the {{perspective}} {{of the leaders of the}} Chinese Communist Party, moreover, codified laws and a strengthened legal system were seen as important means of preventing a possible return of radical policies and a repetition of the era when the Gang of Four ruled by fiat and inconsistent party regulations. Aside from establishing a legal code that would be more difficult for corrupt officials to manipulate, the new laws made the courts responsible for applying all but minor sanctions and made the police answerable to the courts. Procuratorates, which had fallen <b>into</b> disuse during <b>the</b> Cultural Revolution, were reinstituted to prosecute criminal cases, review court decisions, and investigate the legality of actions taken by the police and other government organizations. A greater role for the courts and independent investigations were expected to make it more difficult to introduce politically colored testimony <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>courtrooms.</b>|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, the law {{has been}} {{considered}} as devoid of emotions, however recent research has begun to analyze <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> as an emotional scene. The emotion norms of <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> are thus interesting to explore and, as <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> work and emotions of de- fense lawyers have received little sociological attention, {{this will be the}} focus of this paper. The aim here is to show the emotions that are present in <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> and how they are managed using the case of anger and I will also discuss the use of niceness. The paper will also explore the ways in which anger and niceness should be displayed in order to both conform to the emotional regime of <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> and in order to show loyalty to the cli- ent, loyalty comprising the guiding principle of defense lawyers in Sweden. The paper will also discuss the background to the recent shift from viewing courtrooms as unemotional arenas to a move in sociological and legal research aimed at uncovering the emotions lying beneath. I aim therefore to explore what defense lawyers actually do in <b>the</b> <b>courtroom,</b> that is, <b>the</b> interactional and emotional strategies used to represent clients in order to give the impression of being loyal to the client. By studying this in a context where the scope for expressive gestures is limited, namely <b>the</b> Swedish <b>courtroom,</b> it is possible to gain a greater understanding <b>into</b> <b>the</b> prevailing emotional regime of <b>the</b> <b>courtroom</b> and <b>the</b> ways in which legal representation is performed.
