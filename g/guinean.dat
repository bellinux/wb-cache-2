5|$|The New <b>Guinean</b> magpie, G. tibicen papuana, is {{a little-known}} {{subspecies}} found in southern New Guinea. The adult male has a mostly white {{back with a}} narrow black stripe, and the female a blackish back; the black feathers here are tipped with white similar to subspecies dorsalis. It has a long deep bill resembling that of subspecies longirostris.

5|$|Morchella tridentina (=Morchella frustrata) is also rufescent {{and very}} similar to M. rufobrunnea. It is found in mountainous forests and maquis and forms a marked sinus at the {{attachment}} of the cap with the stem, which is pure white. At maturity, it develops more or less parallel, ladderlike interconnecting ridges. Microscopically, it often has moniliform paraphyses with septa extending in the upper half and has more regularly cylindrical or clavate 'hairs' on the stem, up to 100 μm long. M.guatemalensis, found in Central America, has a color ranging from yellow to yellowish-orange, but never grey, {{and it has a}} more distinct reddish to wine red bruising reaction. Microscopically, it has smaller paraphyses, measuring 56–103 by 6.5–13µm. The New <b>Guinean</b> species M.rigidoides has smaller fruit bodies that are pale ochre to yellow, without any grey. Its pits are less elongated than those of M.rufobrunnea, and it has wider paraphyses, up to 30µm.|$|E

Leaving South Africa in secret via Bechuanaland, on his way Mandela visited Tanganyika and met with its president, Julius Nyerere. Arriving in Ethiopia, Mandela met with Emperor Haile Selassie I, and gave his speech after Selassie's at the conference. After the symposium, he travelled to Cairo, Egypt, admiring the political reforms of President Gamal Abdel Nasser, {{and then went to}} Tunis, Tunisia, where President Habib Bourguiba gave him £5,000 for weaponry. He proceeded to Morocco, Mali, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Senegal, receiving funds from Liberian President William Tubman and <b>Guinean</b> President Ahmed Sékou Touré. Leaving Africa for London, England, he met anti-apartheid activists, reporters, and prominent politicians. Returning to Ethiopia, he began a six-month course in guerrilla warfare, but completed only two months before being recalled to South Africa by the ANC's leadership.|$|E
5|$|The {{poisonous}} pitohuis, {{including the}} hooded pitohui, are not thought {{to create the}} toxic compound themselves but instead sequester them from their diet. Phyllobates frogs kept in captivity do not develop the toxins, {{and the extent of}} the toxicity varies both in the pitohuis across their range and also across the range of the unrelated blue-capped ifrit, another New <b>Guinean</b> bird found with toxic skin and feathers. Both of these facts suggest that the toxins are obtained from the diet. The presence of the toxins in the internal organs as well as the skins and feathers rules out the possibility that the toxins are applied topically from an unknown source by the birds.|$|E
50|$|Rather than Portuguese, it is Guinea-Bissau Creole {{which serves}} as the lingua franca and the vehicle of {{national}} identity spoken as both a first and second language. Thus Portuguese, for those who speak it, is often a third language. The native Portuguese speakers in Guinea-Bissau are mostly white <b>Guineans.</b> The reduction of native Portuguese speakers is caused by leave of most white <b>Guineans</b> to Portugal or Brazil and by civil war that affected education. The majority of the approximately 15% of <b>Guineans</b> who speak Portuguese are concentrated {{in an area of}} the capital city, Bissau, known as 'a Praça'. The variety of Guinea Bissau Creole spoken in the capital, Kriol di Bissau, is known for being more Lusitanized, borrowing words more freely from Portuguese.|$|R

5|$|These were {{supplemented}} by less frequent trips by {{the much larger}} Landing Craft Tank and Landing Ships Tank of the VII Amphibious Force, which brought up tanks and artillery pieces. Their capacity was not as great as {{it could have been}} because, due to fear of Japanese air attacks, they had to quickly unload in the darkness. Some 800 men were employed by day and 800 by night unloading craft on the beaches. By 1 November, there were 12,000 rounds of 25 pounder ammunition in the Finschhafen area, and stocks were increasing at a rate of two LCM loads per day. After unloading at Finschhafen, supplies were moved overland to where they were needed by jeeps, and where the terrain prevented this, by hand. In this regard, some New <b>Guinean</b> labourers were employed, but a shortage of such personnel resulted in the Australians allocating some of their combat troops to this role.|$|E
5|$|A second colony was {{established}} at the Arguin archipelago off the West African coast (now part of Mauritania). In contrast to the <b>Guinean</b> colony, Arguin had been a colony before: In 1520, Portugal had built a fort on the main island, which with all of Portugal came under Spanish control in 1580. In 1638 it was conquered by the Dutch Republic, and in 1678 by France, who due to high maintenance costs abandoned it and demolished the fort soon after. On 27 July 1685, an expedition was mounted by Frederick William and Raule, who took possession of the vacated colony on 1 October. Subsequently, the fort was rebuilt and contacts to the indigenous population established. France was alarmed and sent a vessel to re-conquer the fort in late 1687, but the attack of a French frigate and a smaller vessel was beaten back by the Brandenburg-Prussian garrison. The victory improved the relations to the indigenous people, {{many of whom were}} carried off as slaves by the French before. While Arguin did not reach the economic importance of Großfriedrichsburg, it temporarily advanced to the world's primary staple port for slaves.|$|E
5|$|Air {{support was}} {{provided}} by No. 9 Operational Group RAAF, which included several Royal Australian Air Force squadrons such as No. 4 Squadron RAAF, flying CAC Boomerangs and Wirraways, and No. 24 Squadron RAAF equipped with Vultee Vengeance dive bombers; these units undertook numerous close air support and resupply missions throughout the campaign. American Republic P-47 Thunderbolts and Lockheed P-38 Lightnings from the 348th and 475th Fighter Groups were also used to provide fighter cover for Allied shipping, while heavy and medium bombers from the Fifth Air Force carried out strategic bombing missions to reduce Japanese airbases around Wewak and New Britain, and raided Japanese lines of communication in concert with PT boats. Due to the impracticalities of using wheeled transport in the jungle, Allied logistics was undertaken primarily by means of water transport such as landing craft and barges which moved supplies along the coast, with overland supply to combat units being completed by New <b>Guinean</b> labourers and, at times, by Australian combat troops themselves, which were re-roled temporarily to undertake portage tasks as required, and augmented where possible with jeeps.|$|E

5|$|The African colonies enabled Brandenburg-Prussia to {{participate}} in the Triangular trade, yet it lacked its own trading post in the Caribbean Sea. In 1684, Brandenburg-Prussia was denied the purchase of the French islands Sainte Croix and Saint Vincent. In November 1685, after a failed attempt to purchase Saint Thomas from Denmark–Norway, a Brandenburg-Danish agreement was reached that allowed the Brandenburg African Company to rent part of Saint Thomas as a base for 30 years, while the sovereignty remained with Denmark and administration with the Danish West Indies and <b>Guinean</b> Company. The first Brandenburgian vessel arrived in 1686 with 450 Slaves from Großfriedrichsburg. Brandenburg-Prussia was allotted an area near the capital city Charlotte Amalie, called Brandenburgery, and other territories named Krum Bay and Bordeaux Estates further west. In 1688, 300 Europeans and several hundred slaves lived on the Brandenburgian estates. In November 1695, French forces looted the Brandenburgian (not the Danish) colony. In 1731, the Brandenburg-Prussian company on Saint Thomas (BAAC) became insolvent, and abandoned the island in 1735. Their last remains were sold by auction in 1738.|$|E
5|$|The Congo serpent eagle (Circaetus spectabilis) is {{a species}} of bird of prey in the family Accipitridae, and is {{sometimes}} placed in the monotypic genus Dryotriorchis by some taxonomic authorities. This species is found in western and central Africa, with its range stretching from Sierra Leone south to Angola and west to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It occurs in upper and lower <b>Guinean</b> forests, which are dense rainforests. This serpent eagle specializes in hunting in these forests’ dark understories. It has two subspecies, the nominate subspecies Dryotriorchis spectabilis spectabilis and Dryotriorchis spectabilis batesi. Though monotypic, {{it appears to be}} very closely related to Circaetus. This hawk is a medium-sized bird with distinctive short, rounded wings and a long, rounded tail. It is varying shades of brown on its back and has a slight crest. Its breast is white with variable amounts of a rufous wash and, in the nominate subspecies, is covered in round, blackish spots. The subspecies D. s. batesi only has these dots on its flanks. The Congo serpent eagle closely resembles Cassin's hawk-eagle, and some ornithologists believe that this likeness is a rare example of avian mimicry. It is a very vocal raptor, and often {{is one of the most}} heard species in its habitat.|$|E

40|$|Papua New <b>Guineans</b> {{and mining}} have {{become synonymous with}} civil {{conflict}} and turmoil. Numerous works, mainly from the anthropological perspective, have documented the conflict-ridden industry and offered explanations {{for the development of}} community antagonism (see, eg, Filer 1990; Connell and Howitt 1991; Rumsey and Weiner 2001). However, the existing literature on mining is somewhat sparse {{when it comes to the}} participation of Papua New <b>Guineans</b> as employees in the mines. The major aim of this paper is to discuss local employment in Papua New Guinea mines. It does so by examining some of the challenges and conflicts that Papua New <b>Guineans</b> have confronted since their first con-tact with mining in the late 1800 s as adventurers and assistants to their participation as full-fledged paid workers in the current period. A central theme of this paper is that, although they first embraced mining as an adventure, the inevitable imposition of a capitalistic mode of mining operation compelled them to render their labor for a wage. Like miners everywhere, this paper argues, many Papua New <b>Guineans</b> now view mining employment as “the only way ” rather than as one of many ways of making a living. Labor, Conflict, and Mining in Premodern Papua New Guinea Papua New <b>Guineans</b> have had contact with the international mining industry since the late 1800 s. Colonial officials, planters, soldiers, and missionaries provided other major avenues of contact with westerners (West 1958; Waiko 1993, 34).
