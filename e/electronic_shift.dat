50|$|The KW-26 ROMULUS was {{a second}} {{generation}} encryption system in wide use that could be inserted into teletypewriter circuits so traffic was encrypted and decrypted automatically. It used <b>electronic</b> <b>shift</b> registers instead of rotors and became very popular (for a COMSEC device of its era), with over 14,000 units produced. It was replaced in the 1980s by the more compact KG-84, which in turn was superseded by the KG-84-interoperable KIV-7.|$|E
50|$|A special twin DOHC (QUAD CAM) {{version of}} the 2.9 was created by Cosworth Engineering in 1991. Although it shared the same block as the {{standard}} 2.9, power output was up to 195 PS (143 kW) and torque was boosted to 203 lb·ft (275 N·m) at 4500 rpm. This engine (code BOA) {{was used in the}} Ford Scorpio Cosworth 24V. This engine configuration was only paired with an improved A4LDe automatic gearbox with partial <b>electronic</b> <b>shift</b> control. No manual gearbox was offered from the factory.|$|E
50|$|Ford's new 6-speed 6R75 {{intelligent}} {{automatic transmission}} with dual overdrive gears was introduced. The transmission featured push-button overdrive lock-out, <b>electronic</b> <b>shift</b> scheduling, adaptive shift algorithms and a mechatronic {{transmission control module}} (TCM) that would save adaptive shift data in keep alive memory (KAM). This safeguarded against complete data loss {{in case of a}} power failure (such as disconnecting the battery). In the event of a power failure, the mechatronic unit would simply read the last saved data entry from the system's memory, thus, the transmission did not have to completely relearn the owner's driving style.|$|E
50|$|In the mid 1990s Mavic, {{known for}} their wheelsets, {{introduced}} an <b>electronic</b> <b>shifting</b> system which was pioneered in the Tour de France by American Greg LeMond and later on by Briton Chris Boardman, who {{liked the fact that}} the system allowed him to shift from his aerobars and his brake levers. The system did not catch on due to technological hurdles.|$|R
50|$|For 2013 a new 705 {{model is}} being offered with Di2 <b>electronic</b> <b>shifting.</b> This version differs {{slightly}} from the 700 model and requires a motor unit with a battery, and an electronic shifter. Shimano offers different styles of electronic shifters that fit {{a wider range of}} handlebars than the trigger shifter for the 700 model. It is not possible to use the motor unit or electronic shifters with the 700 model.|$|R
50|$|In early March 2006, some pro riders {{were seen}} riding with Shimano <b>electronic</b> <b>shifting</b> groupsets; further {{testing in the}} pro-ranks {{continued}} during the next 2 years. In late 2009, Shimano released their electronically shifted Dura-Ace Di2 groupset, consisting of battery powered, servo actuated front and rear derailleurs controlled by electronic bar-end or brake lever integrated shifting paddles. Other components such as the crankset and brakeset are carryovers from the standard Dura-Ace 7900 group.|$|R
50|$|The {{transmission}} {{was released}} {{with one of}} two versions of gear shift, either the conventional stick shift or the newly developed EPS (Electronic Pneumatic shift) system. However, much like most <b>electronic</b> <b>shift</b> mechanisms of that mid to late 90's era the system did have some mechanical gremlins and reliability issues at times. Although {{it may have been}} more comfortable from a drivers point of view, the EPS was not very popular between truck owners and operators, which even led some truck owners sceptical of reliability the later released Actros Telligent transmission.|$|E
50|$|The 42LE was {{modified}} in 2003 as the 42RLE, originally for the then-new Jeep Liberty. It is a 42LE transaxle, modified {{for use in}} rear-wheel drive vehicles by removing the integral differential and transfer chain. Power flow exits {{the rear of the}} transmission. The case has also been modified. By design it has full <b>electronic</b> <b>shift</b> control with adaptive memory to learn the operator's driving habits controlled by the vehicle's Transmission Control Module (TCM). Contained within the automatic's torque converter is an Electronically Modulated Converter Clutch(EMCC) designed act as a shock absorber for harsh shifting.|$|E
50|$|The Toyota Prius v {{includes}} {{many of the}} same standard features of the 2010 Prius, with four driving modes: Normal, Power, Eco and EV; smart key with push button start, an <b>electronic</b> <b>shift</b> lever, Hill Start Assist Control (HAC), and a back-up camera. Available options include energy-efficient LED headlamps, dynamic radar cruise control with a Pre-Collision System (PCS), and advanced parking guidance system. The Prius v has several technical advancements including Toyota's new Toyota Entune Multimedia System and a panoramic sunroof made of lightweight resin, 40% lighter than a glass roof of the same size. Entune will premiere on the 2012 Toyota Prius v.|$|E

5000|$|The CAN bus {{protocol}} {{has been}} used on the Shimano DI2 <b>electronic</b> gear <b>shift</b> system for road bicycles since 2009, and is also used by the Ansmann and BionX systems in their direct drive motor.|$|R
50|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>Shift</b> On-the-Fly (ESOF) {{transfer}} {{cases have}} a dash-mounted selector switch or buttons with front sealed automatic locking axle hubs or drive flanges. Some models also have {{what is called}} SelecTrac, which has a slider switch on the center console. Unlike the manual transfer case, this system has a transfer case motor. To engage the four-wheel-drive system the vehicle must be moving at a lower speeds, {{the speed at which}} 4x4 can be engaged depends on the vehicle. This is only for the four-wheel-drive high setting. To engage the four-wheel-drive low setting, the vehicle must be stopped and the transmission must be shifted to neutral, then the four-wheel-drive low can be selected.|$|E
5000|$|The new four-speed {{automatic}} transmission, {{now called}} 4R75E, featured fully electronic Smart Shift technology. A turbine speed sensor improved transmission control {{and provided the}} basis for the fully <b>electronic</b> <b>shift</b> scheduling. The transmission's microprocessor speeds were improved for better responsiveness and precision of the control system. The transmission was continuously learning, and would calculate the torque in the next gear and schedule shift points based on the Expedition's projected performance in the next gear. For 2005 model Expeditions the 4R75E transmission is designated by the letter [...] "B" [...] on the manufacturers safety compliance certification label, located in the driver's-side doorjamb. For 2006 model Expeditions, the 4R75E transmission is designated by the letter [...] "Q".|$|E
5000|$|Newer {{transmissions}} {{that are}} referred to as 4R70E or 4R75E have modifications that compliment Fords switching to throttle by wire. The PCM was given a more powerful microprocessor and Ford added a turbine speed sensor to the transmission. This allows the PCM to know the speed of the input shaft after the torque converter which is used in combination with crankshaft speed to detect the amount of slipping going on in the torque converter. This information provides PCM with the basis for fully <b>electronic</b> <b>shift</b> scheduling which limits [...] "hunting" [...] and fine-tunes shift speed and feel. It lets the PCM know what the torque will be in the next gear so it can choose the shift points based on the vehicle's projected performance in the next gear. Coupled with the electronic throttle strategy, the transmission computes the output torque required to maintain the vehicle speed, and chooses the correct gear and converter state accordingly.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{germanium}} detector electronics on diffraction line patterns is investigated. It is shown that not only the detector resolution and the throughput but also the energy stability depend on both the specific detector settings and the dead time. For a moderate resolution versus throughput setting a correction function is proposed and applied to the near surface residual stress analysis of three samples with considerably different stress states. It is demonstrated that without the correction function ghost stresses up to hundreds of MPa in the near surface region are obtained. The correction procedure is verified by conventional X ray measurements. In conclusion, the authors strongly suggest quantifying the <b>electronic</b> <b>shifts</b> of any individual detector systems prior {{to the analysis of}} residual stresse...|$|R
50|$|Recently in 2010, Campagnolo officially {{announced}} the finalization of their {{yet to be}} named <b>electronic</b> <b>shifting</b> groupset. Unveiled {{as part of the}} new Pinarello Dogma Giro d'Italia road bike, the new electronic groupset appears to be similar in structure to Shimano's Dura Ace Di2 groupset in that it combines existing top of the line 11 speed Super Record parts such as the crankset and brakeset with new battery powered, servo actuated front and rear derailleurs controlled wirelessly by an electronic Ergopower styled brake lever/shifter. No specific details about the operation, performance or pricing of the groupset have been released, but Campagnolo did announce that the Spanish Movistar cycling team will be the first professional team to use their electronic gear system in 2011.|$|R
