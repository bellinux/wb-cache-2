40|$|Effect of <b>flosulide,</b> a {{selective}} cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, on passive Heymann nephritis in the rat. BackgroundNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) induce an inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), an enzyme that makes prostaglandins. Two isoforms of COX exist: COX- 1 represents the constitutively expressed enzyme, whereas COX- 2 is the inducible isoform. This {{study investigated the}} role of COX- 2 in the inflammatory processes of the kidneys of rats with passive Heymann nephritis (PHN), and focused {{of the effect of}} {{a selective}} COX- 2 inhibitor, <b>flosulide.</b> COX- 2 –selective inhibitors are thought to represent potent anti-inflammatory agents without major renal side effects. MethodsPHN was induced by injecting heterologous Fx 1 A antiserum into female Wistar rats. Two treatment groups, each consisting of 12 rats with PHN, received either 3 or 9 mg of flosulide/kg body wt/day and were compared with untreated controls. After four weeks, the generation of thromboxane B 2 (TxB 2) and 6 -keto-PGF 1 α were determined in renal tissue and in urine. COX- 2 protein expression was investigated by Western blotting using a selective antibody. ResultsRats with PHN exhibited a marked proteinuria of 71 ± 8 mg/ 24 hr as compared with 2. 0 ± 0. 3 mg/ 24 hr in healthy controls (P < 0. 01). Treatment with <b>flosulide</b> reduced the proteinuria to 26. 1 ± 9 mg/ 24 hr at 3 mg flosulide/kg body wt/day and 35. 5 ± 6 mg/ 24 hr at 9 mg/kg body wt/day, which was equivalent to a reduction of proteinuria by a maximum of 65 % (P < 0. 05). This was accompanied by an increase in glomerular TxB 2 from 3073 ± 355 to 5255 ± 1041 pg/mg glomerular protein and 6 -keto-PGF 1 α from 1702 ± 161 to 2724 ± 770 pg/mg glomerular protein in rats with PHN. COX- 2 protein expression was also highly elevated in comparison to healthy controls. Low-dose <b>flosulide</b> treatment had no effect on COX protein expression and renal prostaglandin formation. High-dose <b>flosulide</b> treatment reduced renal prostaglandin production and caused a marked decline in COX- 1 and COX- 2 protein expression. Urine prostanoid excretion remained unchanged in all therapeutic groups. There was a small though significant reduction in renal creatinine clearance from 0. 86 ml ± 0. 2 /min in untreated controls to 0. 6 ml ± 0. 1 /min in flosulide-treated rats with PHN (P < 0. 01) after four weeks. ConclusionsUnder the influence of <b>flosulide,</b> a highly COX- 2 –selective inhibitor, we observed an antiproteinuric drug effect. The inflammation in PHN induced COX- 2 protein expression that was not affected by low-dose <b>flosulide.</b> COX- 1 and COX- 2 protein expression was affected by high-dose <b>flosulide,</b> which therefore might lose its selectivity. High-dose <b>flosulide</b> induced a decrease in glomerular prostanoid production possibly because of COX- 1 inhibition. Our results suggest that the therapeutic use of <b>flosulide</b> in proteinuria seems advantageous and deserves further studies because the basal prostaglandin levels remain unchanged in the low-dose–treated group, indicating that the compensatory capacity of prostaglandin production, which is essential for the regulation of renal hemodynamics, is maintained...|$|E
40|$|Selective {{cyclooxygenase}} (COX) - 2 inhibitors {{are expected}} to cause fewer gastric side effects because of sparing of COX- 1 -dependent prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in the gastric mucosa. However, the possible contribution of COX- 2 to overall gastric PG biosynthesis is not known. This study demonstrates con-stitutive expression of COX- 2 mRNA and protein in apparently healthy human and rabbit gastric mucosa. This basal expres-sion of COX- 2 protein in human gastric mucosa was increased by lipopolysaccharide and phorbol ester, indicating its up-reg-ulation in response to appropriate stimuli. The functional sig-nificance of COX- 2 -dependent PG formation was studied in terms of PGE 2 generation in the rabbit mucosa and its inhibition by the COX- 2 -selective inhibitor <b>flosulide.</b> There was concen-tration-dependent (IC 50 5 107 6 55 nM) and ultimately com...|$|E
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of Coxs (cyclo-oxygenases) to inhibition {{is known to}} be highly dependent on assay conditions. In the present study, the inhibitor sensitivities of purified Cox- 1 and - 2 were determined in a colorimetric assay using the reducing agent N, N, N ', N '-tetramethyl- p -phenylenediamine. With the detergent genapol X- 100 (2 mM) present, the potencies of nimesulide, ibuprofen, flufenamic acid, niflumic acid and naproxen were increased over 100 -fold against Cox- 2 and titration curve shapes changed, so that maximal inhibition now approached 100 %. Indomethacin, diclofenac and <b>flosulide</b> were not changed in potency. Similar effects of genapol were observed with inhibitors of Cox- 1. DuP- 697 and two analogues became more than 10 -fold less potent against Cox- 2 with genapol present. Tween- 20, Triton X- 100 and phosphatidylcholine, but not octylglucoside, gave qualitatively similar effects as genapol. Similar detergent-dependent changes in inhibitor potency were also observed using a [(14) C]arachidonic acid HPLC assay. The increases in potency of ibuprofen, flufenamic acid, isoxicam and niflumic acid towards Cox- 2 and ibuprofen towards Cox- 1 were accompanied by a change from time-independent to time-dependent inhibition. The interactions of Cox inhibitors has been described in terms of multiple binding step mechanisms. The genapol-dependent increase in inhibitor potency for ketoprofen was associated with an increase in the rate constant for the conversion of the initial enzyme-inhibitor complex to a second, more tightly bound form. The loss of potency for some inhibitors is probably due to inhibitor partitioning into detergent micelles. The present study identifies detergents as another factor that must be considered when determining inhibitor potencies against both Cox isoforms...|$|E
