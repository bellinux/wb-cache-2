5000|$|For 60 Hz operation, the IE2 and IE3 minimum {{full-load}} efficiency {{values are}} virtually {{identical to the}} North American National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) [...] Energy Efficient and Premium <b>Efficiency</b> <b>motor</b> standards, respectively. (NEMA does specify different full-load efficiency values for motors with Totally Enclosed Fan-Cooled and Open Drip-proof enclosures and from 200HP IEC IE3 efficiency is slightly higher than NEMA Premium Efficiency). The IEC minimum full-load efficiency standards are higher for 60 Hz motors than for 50 Hz motors. This is because {{as long as the}} motor torque is constant, I2R or winding resistance losses are the same at 50 Hz and 60 Hz. The motor output power, however, increases linearly with speed, increasing by 20% when the frequency is increased from 50 Hz to 60 Hz. In general, the 60 Hz efficiency is about 2.5% to 0.5% greater than the 50 Hz values. The efficiency gain is greater for smaller motor power ratings.|$|E

The declining prices for semiconductor products has prompted semiconductor manufacturing plants to control costs so as to maintain profitability. This paper presents the potential for energy efficiency improvements at a semiconductor manufacturing plant from various energy efficiency measures such as high <b>efficiency</b> <b>motors,</b> adjustable speed drive <b>motors,</b> high <b>efficiency</b> HVAC, and high efficiency lighting. The effort {{was part of a}} utility-sponsored technical potential study.

In this study, the results show that none of the group replacement with high <b>efficiency</b> <b>motors,</b> adjustable speed drive <b>motors,</b> and high <b>efficiency</b> lighting would yield paybacks of less than 3 years. However, the end-of-useful life replacement with high <b>efficiency</b> <b>motors</b> for abatement of exhaust and deionizing of water as well as high efficiency lighting would yield paybacks of less than 3 years. The installation of adjustable speed drive motors at the end of useful life would not yield average paybacks of less than 3 years.

40|$|Motors {{do not use}} energy when turned off. Reducing motor {{operating}} time by just 10 % usually saves more energy than replacing a standard <b>efficiency</b> <b>motor</b> with a premium <b>efficiency</b> <b>motor.</b> In fact, given that more than 97 % 1 {{of the life cycle}} cost of purchasing and operating a motor in a typical installation is energy related, turning a motor off 10 % of the time could reduce energy costs enough to purchase several new motors. However, a belief persists that stopping and starting motors is harmful. Many users believe that repeated motor starts will use more energy than constant operation, increase utility demand charges, and shorten motor life. While these opinions are not completely without basis, they do need to be put into proper perspective. During starting, a motor accelerates and draws more power than when it is operating steadily at full load. While a typical National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) Design B motor may draw from four to eight times the full-load current during starting, the power factor is low so the input power is not four to eight times the rated load power. Starting usually takes less than 2 seconds and rarely exceeds 10 seconds, even for large, high-inertia loads. Just one minute of additional running time consume...|$|E
