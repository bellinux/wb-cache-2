2500|$|Two {{months after}} his father's death, Gansevoort entered the cap and fur business. Maria sought {{consolation}} in her faith and in April was admitted {{as a member of}} the First Reformed Dutch Church. Uncle Peter Gansevoort, who was one of the directors of the New York State Bank, got Herman a job as clerk for $150 a year. What he thought of all the drama in his young life is a question biographers answer by citing Redburn: [...] "I had learned to think much and bitterly before my time," [...] the narrator remarks, adding, [...] "I must not think of those delightful days, before my father became a bankrupt... and we removed from the city; for when I think of those days, something rises up <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> and almost strangles me." [...] According to Arvin's influential suggestion, with Melville, one has to reckon with the [...] "tormented psychology, of the decayed patrician." ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{have seen}} it, felt it <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mouth, <b>my</b> <b>throat,</b> <b>my</b> [...] chest, my belly, Burning of {{powerful}} salt, burning, eating through [...] my defenceless nakedness. I have been thrust into white, sharp crystals, Writhing, twisting, superpenetrated.|$|R
60|$|She {{wiped her}} eyes with {{the corner of her}} apron, dropped me a curtsey, and withdrew. Feurgéres came in presently, and I avoided looking at him for the first few minutes. To tell the truth, there was a lump <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own <b>throat.</b> When he spoke, however, his tone was as usual.|$|R
60|$|I {{could have}} cried out, but my tongue seemed dry <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "Ola, señor! All sailors are friends," [...] said Don Erminio. [...] "Besides, this bowl {{is large}} and my {{companion}} is sober and very dull. The wine is not Spanish, but it will go, and when I drink your wormwood, <b>in</b> the morning <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> is bad." ...|$|R
60|$|B. B. No, not the same, Sir Patrick. It is {{an entirely}} {{different}} bacillus; only the two are, unfortunately, so exactly alike that you cannot see the difference. You must understand, my dear Sir Patrick, {{that every one of}} these interesting little creatures has an imitator. Just as men imitate each other, germs imitate each other. There is the genuine diphtheria bacillus discovered by Loeffler; and there is the pseudo-bacillus, exactly like it, which you could find, as you say, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own <b>throat.</b>|$|R
60|$|When {{the time}} came to say good-bye, she broke down utterly and I went away with a painful {{constriction}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own <b>throat,</b> a lump which lasted for hours. Not till on the second day as I saw droves of Canadian antelope racing with the train, whilst flights of geese overhead gave certain sign of the wilderness, did I regain my desire to explore the valleys of the North. That lonely old woman on the porch of the Homestead was never absent from my mind.|$|R
60|$|I came to {{a sitting}} posture in an instant, with my kidneys <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> and my hair on end.|$|E
60|$|I {{tried to}} make a jest of it and to speak lightly, but the words still stuck <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then I stopped short. Her {{eyes were}} fixed upon mine and the lie stuck <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat.</b> I went on desperately.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{forgotten}} something. All the same, {{you see the}} moral," [...] Don Erminio resumed. [...] "Merchants are cheats and use cunning tricks. One thinks one knows their plan, but one does not. One puts one's money on the wrong card and it is gone. Sailors are honest and do not get rich. Well, we will carry out our orders. That is enough for me. I have drunk some caña and <b>in</b> the morning <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> is bad." ...|$|R
5000|$|On April 15, 2013, the New York Times {{published}} an Op-ed by Moqbel titled [...] "Gitmo is killing me". In it he described {{that he would}} not eat [...] "until they restore my dignity." [...] He wrote that he had lost 30 pounds and described how it feels being force fed. [...] "As it was thrust in, it made me feel like throwing up. I wanted to vomit, but I couldn't," [...] Moqbel wrote. [...] "There was agony <b>in</b> <b>my</b> chest, <b>throat</b> and stomach. I had never experienced such pain before. I would not wish this cruel punishment upon anyone." [...] His Op-Ed stirred wide commentary.|$|R
60|$|For {{the second}} time <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life I thanked Heaven for that brave and loyal English heart. I called back, but <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> was dry and choked.|$|R

6000|$|My {{lips were}} wet, <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> was cold, [...] My {{garments}} all were dank; [...] Sure I had drunken <b>in</b> <b>my</b> dreams, [...] And still my body drank.|$|R
60|$|My {{first thought}} was that the rioters had flung some heavy piece of camp {{equipage}} into the bushes at random, and then the blood grew cold <b>in</b> <b>my</b> veins as I felt two hands clutching at <b>my</b> <b>throat.</b>|$|R
60|$|He sprang at me, and, though I put up {{the best}} fight that I could <b>in</b> <b>my</b> injured state, got his hands about <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> and began to choke me. Scowl ran to help me, but his wound--for he was hurt--or his utter {{exhaustion}} took effect on him. Or perhaps it was excitement. At any rate, he fell down in a fit. I thought that all was over, when again I heard Umbelazi's voice, and felt Saduko's grip loosen at <b>my</b> <b>throat,</b> and sat up.|$|R
60|$|I spun on my {{heel and}} left him, {{nor did he}} follow; and a great lump was <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> and tears welling in my eyes.|$|E
6000|$|I {{listened with}} my heart <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat.</b> The noise {{seemed to come from}} the hall,--a prodigious pounding. Presently it stopped, and a man's voice cried out:-- ...|$|E
60|$|The knot <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> was dissolved. My pulses quickened with anticipation. I dug {{my heels}} into the mule's belly and pushed on, the portly cleric at my side.|$|E
5000|$|Thin, without fever, not cold, not warm, {{with empty}} eyes, without a shirt, {{the young man}} under the stuffed quilt heaves himself up, hangs around <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> and whispers <b>in</b> <b>my</b> ear, [...] "Doctor, let me die."

60|$|A second {{we stayed}} so, and I thought indeed that my hour was come, when {{suddenly}} I felt the blood <b>in</b> <b>my</b> head released once more. He {{had taken his}} hands from <b>my</b> <b>throat.</b> He seized me now by the collar and dragged me rudely to my feet.|$|R
60|$|When I came {{to myself}} again, it was daylight. I saw the calm, gentle face of Qros bending over {{me as he}} poured some strong fluid down <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> that seemed to shoot through all my body, and melt a curtain <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind. I saw also that beside him stood Ayesha.|$|R
6000|$|... "That may come, in good time. As yet it {{is enough}} to do, if I can keep down this devil here <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat.</b> Women, bring me the scissors." ...|$|E
6000|$|I feel a choking <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>throat,</b> [...] I pant and stagger, {{faint and}} reel! [...] It is--it is--a ten-pound note, [...] And I'm no more in pawn at Lille! ...|$|E

60|$|That afternoon, a {{hot wind}} blew <b>in</b> <b>my</b> face, {{carrying}} fine sand that cut and blinded. It filled <b>my</b> <b>throat,</b> sending {{me to the}} water cask till I was ashamed. When I fell into my bed at night, I never turned. The next day was hotter; the wind blew harder; the sand stung sharper.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not in the least. The {{women here}} think you the finest paladin in the world, and Miss Palliser would fly at <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> {{if she thought}} that I said a word against you.

3000|$|However, {{drinking}} the yellow juice {{is a totally}} different pathology theory. This wizard said additionally that <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> swelled and ached because {{there was too much}} “heat” <b>in</b> <b>my</b> body, and this plant is “cold” in nature. When I took this cold medicine, the heat <b>in</b> <b>my</b> body would be counteracted and <b>my</b> <b>throat</b> ache would be healed. The wizard explained that every human body has the two natures of hot and cold. One will be healthy if he or she has the proper amount of each. If there is too much heat but too little cold, one will get a hot illness such as a swelling and aching throat, toothache, or skin ulcer. If there is too much cold and too little heat, one will get a cold illness such as a weak stomach, back pain, or some women’s diseases. All animals and plants have cold and hot natures. One treats a hot illness with cold plants and a cold illness with hot ones. 17 [...]...|$|R
