In this study, the reduction of fatigue performance due to geometric irregularities is investigated using a multi-axial high cycle fatigue criterion based on the critical plane concept. A thermo-structural finite element model of a track containing an aluminothermic weld is linked with a developed computer code to perform fatigue crack initiation analysis. Two geometrically different aluminothermic welds, one of which is widely used in Australian heavy haul railways, are investigated in terms of fatigue probability, to facilitate a better insight into the effect of weld collar shape and geometry {{at the edge of the}} weld collar on fatigue behaviour.

40|$|When {{manufacturing}} built-up structures different operations like joining, forming {{and casting}} will introduce residual stresses, which will interact with subsequent service loads {{applied to the}} structure and also influence growth of cracks in critical locations. This overview addresses the fatigue design of structures considering the effects of residual stresses caused by manufacturing. The redistribution of residual stresses during operation, the derivation of stress-intensity factors for cracks in residual stress fields and techniques to study growth of cracks in structures containing residual stress fields will be discussed. Joining of components by welding {{will be discussed in}} detail. Welding will introduce residual stresses in the structure due to localized plastic deformation caused by strong temperature gradients, with normally, tensile peaks in the welded region where cracks often are initiated due to the stress concentration. The presence of tensile residual, mean, stresses in regions with stress concentrations make welds susceptible to fatigue crack growth, which has lead to the development of special design codes for welded joints. The background for such codes and different strategies for the fatigue design will be addressed. Some recent applications will be discussed in detail, growth of cracks in spot welded car components, in <b>flash</b> <b>butt</b> <b>welded</b> railway rails and in stress coined holes in plates...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of residual stress in steel members can significantly compromise the stiffness and fatigue life of steel structural components. This influence becomes more serious for the wide <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> {{in the construction}} of large-sized steel members due to the different residual stress distribution from the normal size <b>butt</b> <b>welds.</b> This paper experimentally studied the residual stress in the wide <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> through an 8 -experiment test program. High residual stress was produced during the wide <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> and this stress was observed to be even higher than the yield strength of the steel. Moreover, this residual stress in the steel plate was firstly compressive and then transferred into tensile stress with the increase in the distance away from the <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> line. The magnitude of the residual stress increased with the increase in the width of the welding seams. This paper also developed a finite element model by SYSWELD to simulate the residual stress produced by the wide <b>butt</b> <b>welding.</b> The accuracy of the FE simulation was checked by the reported test results.

For this {{it is necessary to}} conduct a research of the structure and mechanical properties of welded joints of sintered titanium alloys produced by flash welding. Methodology. Titanium industrial powders, type PT 5 - 1 were used as original substance.

40|$|Railway rails {{are today}} often {{continuously}} welded. This type of joint generally requires less maintenance than {{is needed for}} the bolted joints. It has also reduced wheel damage and made the ride more comfortable. However, these joints are subject to damage. The severity of the fatigue problem {{is likely to increase}} since a trend towards higher train speeds, higher axle loads and heavier traffic density is probable even in the future. The thesis deals with the finite element simulation of two manufacturing processes, <b>flash</b> <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> of rails and laser cladding of railheads, and the subsequent service life of the welds under operating conditions. Welding of rails, elasto-plastic material modelling, in particular for material subject to cooling from a melted state, fatigue and general issues in computational welding mechanics are discussed. Experimental data and materials characteristics were collected from full-scale measurements of production welds, at the welding site, and from materials testing of smaller specimens. The microstructure and the material characteristics of both the base and welded materials, in the interval - 40 °C to + 600 °C, for the rail steel R 260 (900 A) were investigated. The emphasis is on the method of joining rails with <b>flash</b> <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> and the coating of surfaces using laser cladding, which were simulated with material models that handle the recovery behavior {{in the vicinity of the}} melting point. In addition, the interaction between residual stresses from the manufacturing operations, and service loads from the wheel-rail contact was studied. The influence of residual stresses on fatigue initiation, of a twin-disc specimen simulating laser cladded rail, and crack growth, from defects in a flash butt weld, was examined. The results showed, in both cases, that the residual stresses caused by the processes were high enough to raise the risk of fatigue failure above that of the base material.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The objective {{of the study was}} to examine factors that influence the strength of <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> and gain an understanding of the process of failure. The study was divided into several sectors. The first and primary part of the programme was to determine the extent to which the pipe system's long-term strength under both internal fluctuating and constant pressure is reduced by the presence of axially misaligned <b>butt</b> <b>welds.</b> The second objective was to examine fracture initiation sites and crack propagation paths of the failed aligned and misaligned <b>butt</b> <b>welded</b> samples in relation to the melt flow zone and the weld bead in order to establish the cause of failure. Finally the project considered the influence of selected welding parameters on the fatigue performance of aligned <b>butt</b> fusion <b>welds</b> and an investigation into the influence of elevated temperature (79 °C) testing technique on the basic material's properties. Fatigue and stress-rupture lifetimes were found to decrease significantly with increasing axial misalignment at the <b>butt</b> fusion <b>weld</b> in 63, 90 and 125 mm MDPE pipe systems at 79 °C in a water environment. In the <b>butt</b> fusion <b>weld</b> having axial misalignment of 20 per cent of the wall thickness and above, the reduction in the fatigue and stress-rupture lifetime was greater than 50 per cent compared to the aligned weld. It was not clear whether there is a pipe size effect or not; there was no marked change in the fatigue performance of misaligned <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> for the three pipe diameters examined. However, the fatigue performance of the aligned <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> in 90 and 125 mm was noticeably better compared to 63 mm pipe systems. The stress rupture performance of misaligned <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> in 90 and 125 mm MDPE pipes was more than halved compared to those in 63 mm pipe systems. Both the fatigue and stress rupture performance of misaligned <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> could be explained in terms of amplified axial stress and in general, the Ory expression for evaluating the increase in axial stress due to misalignment appears to be valid. The temperature dependence of the fatigue performance of aligned and misaligned <b>butt</b> fusion <b>welds</b> in 63 and 90 mm MDPE pipe systems suggests that if continuous internal fluctuating pressure under the conditions examined is maintained, then the <b>butt</b> fusion <b>welds</b> with axial misalignment of below 10 per cent of the wall thickness may well meet the design lifetime of 50 years at the service termperature. Under stress-rupture conditions, all the misaligned <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> considered in the three pipe diameters surpassed the minimum specified requirement of 170 hours at 79 °C. The fatigue was the most aggresive condition of the two for minor misalignment. Examination of the circumferential <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> failures revealed that the crack invariably initiated from the notch located at the inner weld bead and no preferred crack propagation path was taken in relation to the melt flow zone. It was proved that the notch was responsible for the observed circumferential failure of aligned <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> in 63 mm MDPE pipes by testing these <b>butt</b> fusion <b>welds</b> where the internal weld bead was machined off. The failure site for the internal weld bead machined off sample was in the pipe remote from the weld inferring that the material in the melt flow zone does not constitute any weakness. The effect of elevated temperature (79 °C) testing in 63 mm HDPE pipe was found to increase the density (and crystallinity) signifying a slow annealing process in the material. However, the changes in these parameters were not of sufficient scale to strongly influence the performance. The main effect of elevated temperature testing in water environment appears to be the extraction of stabiliser from the base polymer as was indicated by the rapid decrease in oxidation induction time with the ageing times.
