40|$|Abstract-A new CMOS PCM channel fiiter is described, which {{includes}} transmit and receive filters {{on a single}} die. This chip displays an idle-channel noise of typically O dBrnCO, a POWeIsupply rejection ratio of 40 - 50 dB at 1 kHz, and a <b>fully</b> <b>operational</b> <b>power</b> dissipation of only 35 mW, making it very cost effective in telecommunication switching systems. The design of this chip, including architectural, switched capacitor filter, and amplifier considerations is described, and typical experimental results are presented. I...|$|E

40|$|The NASA John H. Glenn Research Center and the U. S. Department of Energy are {{currently}} developing a Stirling convertor {{for use as}} an advanced spacecraft power system for future NASA deep-space missions. As part of this development, a Stirling Technology Demonstrator Convertor (TDC) was recently tested to verify its survivability and capability of withstanding its expected launch random vibration environment. The TDC was <b>fully</b> <b>operational</b> (producing <b>power)</b> during the random vibration testing. The output power of the convertor was measured during the testing, and these results are discussed in this paper. Numerous accelerometers and force gauges were also present which provided information on the dynamic characteristics of the TDC and an indication of any possible damage due to vibration. These measurements will also be discussed in this paper. The vibration testing of the Stirling TDC was extremely successful. The TDC survived all its vibration testing with no structural damage or functional performance degradation. As {{a result of this}} testing, the Stirling convertor's capability to withstand vibration has been demonstrated, enabling its usage in future spacecraft power systems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{modelling}} {{of large}} systems of spiking neurons is computationally very demanding {{in terms of}} processing power and communication. SpiNNaker is a massively-parallel computer system designed to model up to a billion spiking neurons in real time. The basic block of the machine is the SpiNNaker multicore System-on-Chip, a Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous (GALS) system with 18 ARM 968 processor nodes residing in synchronous islands, surrounded by a light-weight, packet-switched asynchronous communications infrastructure. The MPSoC contains 100 million transistors in a 102 mm 2 die, provides a peak performance of 3. 96 GIPS and has a power consumption of 1 W at 1. 2 V when all processor cores operate at nominal frequency. SpiNNaker chips were delivered in May 2011, were <b>fully</b> <b>operational,</b> and met <b>power</b> and performance requirements. I...|$|R
50|$|The Hongping Pumped Storage Power Station is a 1,200 MW pumped-storage {{hydroelectric}} power station currently under construction about 11 km northwest of Hongping in Jing'an County of Jiangxi Province, China. Construction on the project began in June 2010. The first generator was commissioned in June 2014 and a second 1,200 MW phase is planned for completion in 2017. When <b>fully</b> <b>operational,</b> the <b>power</b> station will have an installed capacity of 2,400 MW. The power station operates by shifting water between an upper and lower reservoir to generate electricity. The lower reservoir is located on Hebei River and the upper reservoir {{is located in a}} valley above {{the north side of the}} lower reservoir. During periods of low energy demand, such as at night, water is pumped from Hongping Lower Reservoir up to the upper reservoir. When energy demand is high, the water is released back down to the lower reservoir but the pump turbines that pumped the water up now reverse mode and serve as generators to produce electricity. The process is repeated as necessary and the plant serves as a peaking power plant. It is operated by Jiangxi Hongping Pumped Storage Ltd.|$|R
