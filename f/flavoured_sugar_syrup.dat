5000|$|In mid-2009 Cadbury {{replaced}} {{some of the}} {{cocoa butter}} in their non-UK chocolate products with palm oil. Despite stating this {{was a response to}} consumer demand to improve taste and texture, there was no [...] "new improved recipe" [...] claim placed on New Zealand labels. Consumer backlash was significant from environmentalists and chocolate lovers in both Australia and New Zealand, with consumers objecting to both the taste from the cheaper formulation, and the use of palm oil given its role in the destruction of rainforests. By August 2009, the company announced that it was reverting to the use of cocoa butter in New Zealand and Australia, although palm oil is still listed as an ingredient in Cadbury's <b>flavoured</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> based fillings (where it referred to as 'vegetable oil'). In addition, Cadbury stated they would source cocoa beans through Fair Trade channels. In January 2010 prospective buyer Kraft pledged to honour Cadbury's commitment.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally in India, kulfi is sold by vendors called kulfiwalas, {{who keep}} the kulfi frozen {{by placing the}} moulds inside a large {{earthenware}} pot called a matka, filled with ice and salt. It is served on a leaf or frozen onto a stick. It can be garnished with pistachios, cardamom, and similar items. Often it is served as falooda kulfi, which is kulfi with rice noodles, rose, or any <b>flavour</b> <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> and other ingredients.

40|$|Dietary {{energy for}} {{chickens}} normally includes cereal grains and fat. This innovative {{study investigated the}} effect of replacing part of the corn and fat in broiler chicken rations with graded levels of <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> on growth performance and biochemical parameters. Experimental treatments consisted of feeding a corn-soy basal diet alone, or with graded levels of <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> in increments of 5 %, 10 % and 15 %. All starter diets were isonitrogenous and isocaloric. Body weight gain and efficiency of feed utilization of chicks fed the control diet alone were not significantly (P <  0. 05) different from chicks fed diets supplemented with either 5 % or 15 % <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup.</b> Supplementation of <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> to broiler diets had no significant effect on blood glucose, creatinine, total protein, or liver enzymes. Adding 5 % <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> to broiler rations significantly decreased blood cholesterol and triglycerides in chickens fed the <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> diet compared with birds fed the control diet. In conclusion, the results shows <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> {{can be used in}} poultry ration to replace part of the corn as a source of energy. These results allowed the authors to recommend the safe usage of <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> in broiler rations...|$|R

Khaja of Kakinada, a coastal town of Andhra Pradesh is very much famous in South India and Orissa. This Khaja is dry from outside and full of <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> from inside and is juicy. Khaja of Puri is also very famous. At first, the batter is of wheat flour, mawa and oil. It is then deep fried until crisp. Then a <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> is made which is known as [...] "pak".

40|$|AbstractRare <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> is a {{sweetener}} {{obtained from}} high-fructose corn syrup under slightly alkaline conditions, which promotes {{the formation of}} rare sugars. Here, the physiological impact and safety of rare <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> in humans was investigated by a randomized double-blind parallel experiment. Thirty-four subjects with an average body mass index of 25. 6 [*]kg/m 2 {{were divided into two}} groups. Subjects consumed either a test drink containing rare <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> or an isocaloric control drink containing high-fructose corn syrup on a daily basis for 12 weeks. Results showed significant decreases in body weight, body fat percentage and waist circumference in the rare <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> group compared to the control. No adverse events with regard to hepatic and renal function or blood parameters were observed. Our study conclusively suggests, for the first time, that rare <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> is a safe sweetener, and that continuous consumption of this syrup could help weight management...|$|R
40|$|Stability {{of vitamin}} C in stored fruit and <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> of Japanese quince was tested. Vitamin C was {{measured}} in the fruit at harvest {{and after a few}} weeks of storage under normal atmospheric conditions. <b>Sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> obtained from the fruit was subjected to analysis before and after pasteurisation, and after several weeks of storage. The Chaenomeles genotypes tested were valuable in terms of vitamin C content. Storage significantly reduced the vitamin C content in the fruit, by 20 % on average after 2 weeks of storage. The mechanical treatment and preparation of <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> decreased the vitamin content by nearly two-thirds when compared with the fruit at harvest. Pasteurisation and storage of the <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> contributed to further losses of vitamin C, reducing it to a very low level...|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, {{the brewery}} {{was ordered to}} cease {{production}} of their product [...] "Schwarzer Abt" [...] or face a $25,000 fine, because the drink contained added <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> it was {{in conflict with the}} beer purity law. The brewery had been brewing the dark beer with <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> in East Germany, which had been allowed under East Germany's permissive brewing laws. The brewery had not explicitly labelled it as beer, but as [...] "A Specialty Made From Schwarzbier, With Invert <b>Sugar</b> <b>Syrup</b> Added Afterward." [...] In 2003, the brewery changed the labelling to simply read [...] "Schwarzbier." [...] In 2005, a German court upheld the brewery's challenge to purity laws and allowed the brewery to add <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> to [...] "Schwarzer Abt" [...] and label it as beer, ending the 10 year legal battle.|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} types of energy feeding (<b>sugar</b> <b>syrup,</b> inverted <b>sugar</b> and juice of sugar-cane) on beeswax production and its economic feasibility are evaluated. Twenty beehives of Africanized Apis mellifera were selected, and five were used for each type of feeding. The treatments were T 1 (sugar-cane juice), T 2 (<b>sugar</b> <b>syrup)</b> and T 3 (inverted sugar). Feedings was provided by Boardman feeders and the amount was adjusted according to consumption. A layer of beeswax was manually set up into the honeybee nest and beeswax built area was measured weekly. Total reducing sugar, calorimetry, dry matter and ashes of all feedings were analyzed. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance with Tukey’s test to determine differences among averages. The average consumption of inverted sugar was significantly lower than that of other treatments. The highest beeswax production average occurred in the <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> treatment. The highest average of ashes, dry matter and reducing sugar occurred, respectively, in sugar-cane juice, inverted <b>sugar</b> and <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup.</b> <b>Sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> may be an alternative energy source for beeswax production, although sugar-cane juice may be more profitable. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this work, a new candying {{procedure}} with partial re-use of <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> is proposed. Physicochemical analysis, together with sensory evaluation, of candied celeriac samples was done. Candying {{was performed in}} a pilot unit at 65 C, through three cycles of 5 hours duration each. <b>Sugar</b> <b>syrups</b> of 75 Brix were used. Effects of 1 % (m/v) citric and 1 % (m/v) ascorbic acid addition, {{as well as the}} drying of candied celeriac (60 C for 8 h) were studied. <b>Sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> deterioration was estimated by the concentration of hydroxymethylfurfural. The results obtained showed that there were no significant. P 001 /. Differences were observed in sugar compositions between samples. After three cycles, samples turned lighter, with decreased L values after drying. The celeriac from the first cycle of the ascorbic acid addition procedure was adjudged best with respect to all quality parameters. The decreased concentration of hydroxymethylfurfural confirmed that re-use of <b>sugar</b> <b>syrup</b> is possible...|$|R
