5|$|The 1979 Moon Agreement {{was created}} to {{restrict}} the exploitation of the Moon's resources by any single nation, but as of 2014, it has been signed and ratified by only 16 nations, none of which engages in self-launched human space exploration or has plans to do so.

5|$|Nine manuscripts survive <b>in</b> <b>whole</b> <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>part,</b> {{though not}} all are of equal {{historical}} value {{and none of them}} is the original version. The oldest seems to have been started towards the end of Alfred's reign, while the most recent was written at Peterborough Abbey after a fire at that monastery in 1116. Almost all of the material in the Chronicle {{is in the form of}} annals, by year; the earliest are dated at 60 BC (the annals' date for Caesar's invasions of Britain), and historical material follows up to the year in which the chronicle was written, at which point contemporary records begin. These manuscripts collectively are known as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.|$|E

5|$|There are oft-repeated {{historical}} {{claims that}} Joshua Norton arrived in San Francisco {{on a specific}} vessel, the Franzeska, on 23 November 1849; that he arrived with $40,000, <b>in</b> <b>whole</b> <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> a bequest from his father's estate; and that he parlayed this into a fortune of $250,000. None of this is substantiated by contemporaneous documentation. What is known is that, after Norton arrived in San Francisco, he enjoyed {{a good deal of}} success in commodities markets and in real estate speculation, and that by late 1852, {{he was one of the}} more prosperous, respected citizens of the city.|$|E
5|$|Where a County Association {{had been}} formed, an Order in Council {{could be made}} {{providing}} for the transfer of specified Yeomanry and Volunteer units from that county, <b>in</b> <b>whole</b> <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>part,</b> into the Territorial Force.

An Order in Council was made under this section on 19 March 1908, which transferred all existing units of the Yeomanry and Volunteers, with a small number of exceptions.|$|E
5|$|Douglas's most {{important}} patrons were the Grosvenor family of Eaton Hall, Cheshire. In 1865 he was commissioned {{to design the}} entrance lodge and other structures for Grosvenor Park in Chester, and StJohn's Church {{in the village of}} Aldford in the Eaton Hall estate for Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster. When the marquess died in 1869 he was succeeded by his son Hugh Grosvenor, 1stDuke of Westminster. Douglas received a large number of commissions from the 1st Duke and from his son, the 2nd Duke, throughout his career. It is estimated that for the 1stDuke alone he designed four churches and chapels, eight parsonages and large houses, about 15schools, around 50farms (<b>in</b> <b>whole</b> <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>part),</b> about 300cottages, lodges and smithies, two factories, two inns and about 12commercial buildings on the Eaton Hall estate alone. He also designed buildings on the duke's Halkyn estate in Flintshire, including another church.|$|E

5|$|Twelve {{days out}} of Delaware Bay, Bonnet entered the estuary of the Cape Fear River and {{anchored}} {{near the mouth of}} a small waterway now known as Bonnet's Creek. The Royal James had begun to leak badly and was in need of careening. Shortly afterwards, a small shallop entered the river and was captured. Bonnet had the shallop broken up to help repair the Royal James. The work of careening was done, <b>in</b> <b>whole</b> <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>part,</b> by the prisoners Bonnet had captured. Bonnet threatened at least one man with marooning if he did not work with the slaves to repair the Royal James. Bonnet remained in the Cape Fear River for the next 45 days. According to Bonnet's boatswain, Ignatius Pell, the pirates intended to wait out the hurricane season there.|$|E
5|$|On 26 February 2007, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) {{presented}} its {{judgment in}} the Bosnian Genocide Case, {{in which it}} had examined atrocities committed in detention camps, including Omarska, in relation to Article II (b) of the Genocide Convention. The Court stated in its judgment:Having carefully examined the evidence presented before it, and taken note of that presented to the ICTY, the Court considers {{that it has been}} established by fully conclusive evidence that members of the protected group were systematically victims of massive mistreatment, beatings, rape and torture causing serious bodily and mental harm during the conflict and, in particular, in the detention camps. The requirements of the material element, as defined by Article II (b) of the Convention are thus fulfilled. The Court finds, however, on the basis of evidence before it, that it has not been conclusively established that those atrocities, although they too may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, were committed with the specific intent (dolus specialis) to destroy the protected group, <b>in</b> <b>whole</b> <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>part,</b> required for a finding that genocide has been perpetrated.|$|E
5|$|There are {{currently}} four business routes of Interstate69 (I-69) in the US state of Michigan.

The BL I-69 through Lansing and East Lansing was previously part of M-78 and Temporary I-69 until it was redesignated in 1987. Before 1984, the loop in Port Huron was originally part of M-21 and was initially a business spur numbered Business Spur Interstate69 (BS I-69). It was later redesignated when it was extended to run concurrently with that city's BL I-94 which was originally part of I-94's predecessor, US25. Each business loop follows streets through each city's downtown areas and connects to I-69 on both ends, giving traffic a route through the downtown {{and back to the}} freeway.|$|E
