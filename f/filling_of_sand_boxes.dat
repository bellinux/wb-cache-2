40|$|Soil {{hydraulic}} {{properties are}} of main interest for estimating {{water and energy}} fluxes at the land surface. In general, estimation of the hydraulic properties relies on the measurement of the soil water status within the soil profile usually performed with in-situ sensors such as time-domain reflectometry (TDR) or capacitance probes. Unfortunately, these sensors do {{not account for the}} high spatial and temporal variability in the soil, especially over large areas. In the opposite, proximal sensors such as ground-based microwave radiometer and radar can be used to obtained information at a larger scale. However, these sensors solely provide shallow subsurface information on the moisture status, and the retrievals might be biased by confounding factors such as soil surface roughness. L-band radiometer and off-ground ground-penetrating radar (GPR) measurements were performed above a rectangular wooden box (2. 00 x 2. 00 m 2 area and 1. 00 m height) homogeneously filled with sand. The radiometer was fixed on an arc of 5 m radius with an observation angle of 35 ° while the GPR was fixed above the <b>sand</b> <b>box</b> at nadir position. In order to avoid the brightness temperatures measured being affected by radiance originating from areas outside the <b>sand</b> <b>box,</b> the surrounding <b>of</b> the <b>sand</b> <b>box</b> was covered with a reflector made up of a mesh grid with a mash-size much smaller than the wavelength of the radiometer.

The major drawback with the latter method is that the stress conditions in the <b>sand</b> <b>box</b> cannot be regulated strictly.

The reliability test is based on two physically and statistically independent sets of experiments.

Accordingly, an induced anisotropic plasticity model predicting dynamic behaviour <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> is presented. The model incorporates the critical/steady state concept that postulates the existence of a state where sand continuously deforms at a certain constant effective stress depending two main parameters of both initial bulk parameters (i. e. void ratio or relative density) and stress level (i. e. mean stress). The local instability <b>of</b> saturated <b>sand</b> within post-liquefaction is highly dependent on the residual inherent/induced anisotropy, bedding plane effects, and stress/strain path.

30|$|The ballast layer, {{filled with}} fine {{particles}} like blown <b>sand,</b> is one <b>of</b> the important problems of ballasted railway tracks in desert areas. Blown sand, as a contaminator of ballast layer, increases track stiffness and may cause serious damage to sleepers, pads, rails, and vehicles. In this paper, {{the effects of}} increasing track stiffness due to windy sands in the ballast layer and the train induced vibrations due to this phenomenon were studied. Based on field studies in a desert area in Iran, a two-dimensional finite/infinite element model for a railway track with plane strain condition was analyzed using the software ABAQUS, and the track vibrations were examined by changing the values of stiffness of ballast layer. Vibrations caused by the load of train at different distances from the cross-section of track were investigated, and the values of vertical vibration displacement, velocity, and acceleration were calculated. Results show that acceleration values of vertical vibration increase with the increasing of ballast layer stiffness caused by the <b>filling</b> <b>of</b> <b>sand,</b> while the vertical vibration velocity of track and the induced ground displacement decrease. The farther {{the distance from the}} source of vibration, the less the displacement, velocity, and acceleration. In addition, the methods for reducing train-induced vibrations were introduced.|$|R

Soil evaporation rate is often characterized by two distinct phases, namely, the energy limited phase (stage-I) and the soil hydraulic limited period (stage-II). In this paper, a laboratory experiment was conducted using a <b>sand</b> <b>box</b> filled with fine sand, which was subject to evaporation {{for a period of}} twenty three days. The setup was equipped with a weighting system to record automatically the weight <b>of</b> the <b>sand</b> <b>box</b> with a constant time-step. Furthermore, time-lapse air-launched ground penetrating radar (GPR) measurements were performed to monitor the evaporation process. The GPR model involves a full-waveform frequency-domain solution of Maxwell’s equations for wave propagation in three-dimensional multilayered media. The accuracy of the full-waveform GPR forward modelling with respect to three different petrophysical models was investigated. Moreover, full-waveform inversion of the GPR data was used to estimate the quantitative information, such as near surface soil water content. The two stages of evaporation can be clearly observed in the radargram, which indicates qualitatively that enough information is contained in the GPR data. The fullwaveform GPR inversion allows for accurate estimation of the near surface soil water content during extended evaporation phases, when a wide frequency range of GPR (0. 8 – 5. 0 GHz) is taken into account. In addition, the results indicate that the CRIM model may constitute a relevant alternative in solving the frequency-dependency issue for full waveform GPR modelling...|$|R

This study in Nebraska combined with results of earlier work there, in southeastern Wyoming, and; northeastern Colorado, outlines the complex cut and <b>fill</b> history <b>of</b> the Ogallala close to Rocky Mountain source areas. Parts of the Ogallala consist <b>of</b> <b>fills</b> <b>of</b> <b>sand</b> and gravel, including very large, locally derived clasts, deposited in anastomosing channels carved into bedrock. These channels may be several kilometers wide, up to 50 + m deep, and may cut across other older Ogallala channels with similar geometries. Local tributary fills also occur in the Ogallala. These fills usually are composed of sediments eroded by streams from Miocene and Oligocene sandstone and siltstone formerly exposed along paleovalley sides near the sites of sediment deposition. Up to six volcanic ash deposits have been found in superposed sequences of the Ogallala in the study area. These deposits have blanket, lens, shoestring and irregular geometries. Ash colors are shades of yellow and gray. Shards vary from silt to coarse sand size. Ash deposits are up to 6 - 7 m thick.

Piping {{is a kind of}} backward progressing internal erosion that occurs under impervious hydraulic structures lying on a sandy soil (Fig. 1). Despite not many cases of piping-induced collapse have been documented, piping is nowadays considered a big threat due to the difficulty in recognizing clearly the traces of this mechanism before and even after collapse occurs [1, 2]. For this reason, small-scale physical models are being set up in the laboratory, in an attempt to reproduce the conditions leading to the growth of erosion channels (pipes) in sand [3].
