Based on the increased solubility and higher complexation efficiency, IEF and HPβCD solid complexes were prepared by kneading, freeze-drying, co-evaporation, spray-drying and microwave. The solid complexes were characterized using <b>Fourier</b> <b>transformed-infrared</b> <b>spectroscopy,</b> differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and the isoflavone content and solubility were determined by liquid chromatography. The {{results suggest that the}} isoflavones daidzein, genistein and glycitein may be externally associated to HPβCD as well as that isoflavones/HPβCD inclusion complexes are formed through the insertion of B-ring into the cyclodextrin cavity. Except for the freeze-dried IEF/HPβCD solid complex, all complexes showed similar content and solubility. In conclusion, the three isoflavones showed to be able to simultaneously complex with HPβCD...|$|E

There are several advantages of heterogeneous catalyst in the chemical reaction compared to homogeneous such cost reduction, environmental friendly and easy to separate. In this study, ZSM- 5 zeolite was synthesized using hydrothermal method utilising rice husk ash (RHA) which is agriculture waste of silica source.

The composites were manufactured by twin-screw extrusion followed by compression molding. In particular, {{the effect of}} coupling agent (maleated polyethylene) concentration (0, 2, and 4 wt%) was inves-tigated. From the composites obtained, the morphological, structural, and thermal properties were evaluated via scan-ning electron microscopy, <b>Fourier</b> <b>transformed-infrared</b> spectrometry, and thermogravimetric analysis. The effect of fiber ratio and compatibilization on mechanical performances was studied in tension, flexion, torsion, and impact. The {{results showed that the}} compatibilized composites have better fiber dispersion/distribution (homogeneity) due to chemical bonding leading to good interfacial adhesion.

To prevent this risk of infec- tion, cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH), an antimicrobial enzyme able to use various oligosaccharides as electron donors to produce hydrogen peroxide using oxygen as an electron acceptor, was covalently grafted onto plasma- activated urinary polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) catheter surfaces. Successful immobilization of CDH on PDMS was confirmed by <b>Fourier</b> <b>transformed-infrared</b> spectrometry and production of H 2 O 2. The CDH functionalized PDMS surfaces reduced the amount of viable Staphylococcus aureus by 60 %, total biomass deposited on the surface by 30 % and 70 % of biofilm formation. The immobilized CDH was relatively stable in artificial urine over 16 days, retaining 20 % of its initial activity. The CDH coated PDMS surface did not affect the growth and physiology of HEK 239 and RAW 264, 7 mamma- lian cells.

40|$|Advantages of the {{supercritical}} fluid (SCF) process {{compared to the}} conventional solution stirring method (CSSM) {{in the preparation of}} daidzein-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) complexes were investigated. Formation of daidzein/ HPβCD inclusion complexes was confirmed by <b>Fourier</b> <b>transformed-infrared</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Particle size, inclusion yield, drug solubility and dissolution of daidzein/HPβCD complexes were evaluated. Compared to CSSM, the SCF process resulted in higher inclusion yield and higher solubility. Also, extended dissolution of daidzein from the SCF processed HPβCD inclusion complexes was observed, with only 22. 94 % released in 45 min, compared to its rapid release from those prepared by CSSM, with 98. 25 % drug release in 15 min. This extended release of daidzein from SCF prepared inclusion complexes was necessary to avoid drug precipitation and improve drug solubilisation in the gastrointestinal tract.

40|$|Cantaloupe Melon (Cucumis melo L.) is a {{fruit plant}} riching in {{antioxidant}} beta-carotene. Perhaps, production of beta-carotene {{can also be}} achieved by first initiating callus culture of the plant in suitable medium, propagating them, and extracting the compound it produce. This research was a preliminary effort aimed to examine it. The results of this research showed that the optimum medium for callus culture initiation from cotyledon of Cantaloupe Melon and its propagation was Murashige Skoog (MS) {{with the addition of}} 1 mg/L benzyl adenine (BA) and 1. 5 mg/L napthalene acetic Acid (NAA). The beginning of stationary phase on calluses’ growth curve was chosen as a harvest time of calluses, based on the theory that beta-carotene as a secondary metabolite is usually be produced much at that phase. The results demonstrated that stationary phase began at the end of week fourth, so the time was decided as the harvest time of calluses. Beta-carotene was then extracted from calluses by maceration technique.

40|$|Lead calcium {{titanate}} (Pb(1 -x) Ca(x) TiO(3) or PCT) {{thin films}} have been thermally treated under different oxygen pressures, 10, 40 and 80 bar, {{by using the}} so-called chemical solution deposition method. The structural, morphological, dielectric and ferroelectric properties were characterized by x-ray diffraction, FT-infrared and Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and polarization-electric-field hysteresis loop measurements. By annealing at a controlled pressure of around 10 and 40 bar, well-crystallized PCT thin films were successfully prepared. For the sample submitted to 80 bar, the x-ray diffraction, <b>Fourier</b> <b>transformed-infrared</b> and Raman data indicated deviation from the tetragonal symmetry. The most interesting feature in the Raman spectra is the occurrence of intense vibrational modes at frequencies of around 747 and 820 cm(- 1), whose presence depends strongly {{on the amount of}} the pyrochlore phase. In addition, the Raman spectrum indicates the presence of symmetry-breaking disorder, which would be expected for an amorphous (disorder) and mixed pyrochlore-perovskite phase. During the high-pressure annealing process, the crystallinity and the grain size of the annealed film decreased. This process effectively suppressed both the dielectric and ferroelectric behaviour. Ferroelectric hysteresis loop measurements performed on these PCT films exhibited a clear decrease in the remanent polarization with increasing oxygen pressure...|$|R
40|$|Small amounts (1 – 5 vol%) of {{ammonium}} hydroxide (NH 4 OH) {{were added to}} the ethanol–water-based hydroxyapatite (HA) sol–gel solution. After aging the sol, a Ti substrate was dip-coated and heat-treated at 5001 C for 1 h in air. The sol prop-erties were monitored in terms of pH, viscosity, and structure changes with aging time; also, the coating phase and structure on Ti were investigated. During aging, the viscosity of the sol increased while the pH decreased, confirming the polymerization and gelation of the sol. The addition of NH 4 OH altered the sol properties significantly. Increase in the NH 4 OH concentration increased the pH and viscosity of the sol considerably, especially at short aging period, followed by a saturation with further ag-ing. The <b>Fourier</b> <b>transformed-infrared</b> analysis also confirmed a gradual structure change of the sol with NH 4 OH addition. Such changes in pH, viscosity, and structure bands of the sol driven by the NH 4 OH addition were attributed to the improved polymer-ization and gelation of the sol. The improved gelation shortened the aging time needed for crystallization of the apatite coating, i. e., increase in the NH 4 OH addition improved the crystalliza-tion of the coatings. Within 24 h aging time, the coatings on Ti containing over 3. 5 vol % NH 4 OH showed characteristic HA phase and structure bands, at which period no apatite peaks were observed on the HA coating obtained without NH 4 OH addition.

Each fraction was measured for antioxidant activity by determining the rate of oxidation of β-carotene-linoleic acid in an emulsion system. An ethanol extract exhibited the highest antioxidant activity. Purification of the most active fraction was accomplished by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Antioxidant activity was not significantly effected by heating at 100 °C for 4 hr or 30 days storage at 4 °C.

40|$|AbstractThe present {{work was}} {{designed}} to obtain a fraction containing high concentration of isoflavone-aglycones from Glycine max (L.) Merr., Fabaceae, named isoflavone enriched-fraction, from a dry extract containing isoflavones-glycosides. A simple and low cost method was proposed: extraction of isoflavone glycosides from the G. max dry extract with a proper solvent, hydrolysis of the glycosides, recovery of the aglycones, and purification of the fraction containing high isoflavone-aglycones concentration. All the extraction and purification parameters were optimized based on the isoflavones yields, which were analyzed by liquid chromatography and expressed as total isoflavone aglycones. The optimization of the process conditions was accomplished using the classical one-variable-at-a-time method. The identity and purity of the isoflavones contained in this enriched fraction were determined by LC/UV/ESI/MS analysis, <b>Fourier</b> <b>transformed-infrared</b> <b>spectroscopy,</b> and 1 H and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The physicochemical properties of the isoflavone enriched-fraction were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{was to assess the}} effect of 2 {{formulation}} variables, the pectin type (with different degrees of esterification [DEs]) and the amount of calcium, on drug release from pectin-based matrix tablets. Pectin matrix tablets were prepared by blending indomethacin (a model drug), pectin powder, and various amounts of calcium acetate and then tableting by automatic hydraulic press machine. Differential scanning calorimetry, powder x-ray diffraction, and <b>Fourier</b> <b>transformed-infrared</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> studies of the compressed tablets revealed no drug-polymer interaction and the existence of drug with low crystallinity. The in-vitro release studies in phosphate buffer (United States Pharmacopeia) and tris buffer indicated that the lower the DE, the greater the time for 50 % of drug release (T 50). This finding is probably because of the increased binding capacity of pectin to calcium. However, when the calcium was excluded, the pectins with different DEs showed similar release pattern with insignificant difference of T 50. When the amount of calcium acetate was increased from 0 to 12 mg/tablet, the drug release was significantly slower. However, a large amount of added calcium (ie, 24 mg/tablet) produced greater drug release because of the partial disintegration of tablets. The results were more pronounced in phosphate buffer, where the phosphate ions induced the precipitation of calcium phosphate. In conclusion, both pectin type and added calcium affect the drug release from the pectin-based matrix tablets...|$|E

During the photocatalytic reaction, the collected liquid sample was tested for chemical oxygen demand, pH, and colour intensity while the gaseous sample was analyzed via gas chromatography. The optimum catalyst loading was 0. 5 g/L, corresponds to highest photocatalytic degradation (51. 15 %) and decolourization (96. 21 %). The pH alteration on palm oil mill effluent has negligible effect on its photocatalytic degradation with UV/WO 3 system. For longevity study, the optimum reaction time was 16 h, which achieved 84. 70 % photocatalytic degradation and 98. 28 % photocatalytic decolourization. From the recyclability study, it can be concluded that the tungsten oxides photocatalyst is suitable for photocatalytic decolourization of palm oil mill effluent, but not suitable for photocatalytic degradation.
