40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} is to develop a model of a <b>valve</b> <b>system</b> {{applicable}} for strain and stress prediction. Design/methodology/approach: The analytical and numerical approaches are presented to provide an overview for available methods and prediction accuracy. Findings: An equivalent numerical model of a <b>disc</b> <b>valve</b> <b>system</b> of different complexity was developed and discussed. Research limitations/implications: It is important to provide a model functionality allowing for calculation of disc stacks supported by a coil spring and stack settings having the opening limiter. Disc stack stress and opening characteristics vs. applied pressure may be determined with simplified analytically derived model and full 2 D model including almost all significant forces and moments in a stack of circular plates. An advantage of a simplified disc stack model is possibility of its implementation in an environment supporting matrix operations, e. g. Matlab. Practical implications: A <b>valve</b> <b>system</b> has to withstand the cyclic pressure load across the piston. The number of discs, their diameters and thicknesses directly affect durability of a <b>valve</b> <b>system.</b> Damper force and valve durability expressed in life-cycles are the optimization criteria considering during selection and tuning of a <b>valve</b> <b>system.</b> Originality/value: A new <b>valve</b> <b>system</b> was developed in two versions, i. e. simplified and advanced. The model allows durability prediction at the design stage reducing the testing costs of low-performance <b>valve</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper proposes an {{analytical}} tool {{that supports the}} design process of a <b>disc</b> spring <b>valve</b> <b>system</b> used in car dampers. The proposed analytical tool obtains a key design characteristic of a valve, which is the flow rate and the corresponding maximum stress level in the stack of plates, {{as a function of}} a pressure load. The tool is prepared based on the cases produced by a first-principle model using a finite element approach. The finite element model was calibrated based on experimental results to provide accurate results in the entire range of input parameters...|$|R

40|$|A flow {{visualization}} {{study of}} prosthetic aortic and mitral heart valves {{in a model}} of the aorta and left heart An in vitro flow visualization study has been carried out on a range of aortic and mitral valve prostheses mounted in rigid, transparent models of the aorta and left ventricle. The valves were subjected to pulsatile flow and the flow patterns produced by each valve were visualized by injecting multi-dye streams into the valve orifice, or by observing illuminated particles suspended in the flow. The patterns were recorded by still photography and high speed cinematography. In the mitral region each tilting <b>disc</b> <b>valve</b> produced a large vortex which dominated the ventricular cavity. By contrast <b>disc</b> and ball <b>valves</b> each produced an annular vortex, and the bioprosthesis produced a central flow. In the aortic region the flow patterns produced by a tilting <b>disc</b> <b>valve</b> depended on the orientation of the valve in the aorta. The aortic ball valve was found to produce less flow disturbance than either tilting <b>disc</b> <b>valve</b> or the porcine bioprosthesis...|$|R

(2) As the back-pressure of the scavenging port P_d increases, the piston valve engine speed that gives the largest value of the delivery ratio moves to the region of higher engine speed, and does not move in the rotary <b>disc</b> <b>valve</b> engine.

Zimmermann also used a new crankshaft providing 'square' bore and stroke dimensions (54mm x 54mm) and used stuffing rings to boost the primary compression ratio. However, the East German government didn't like the competition between the two East Germans and persuaded Zimmermann to reveal his engine's secrets to Kaaden. The result was the 1953 IFA racer that featured a rotary <b>disc</b> <b>valve</b> - as per Zimmermann - from 1953.|$|R
50|$|The S2 Mach II was a 350 cc Kawasaki {{motorcycle}} introduced for the 1972 {{model year}} and discontinued {{at the end}} of the 1974 model year.

50|$|The {{engine was}} {{advanced}} for its time, with features normally seen on race bikes: two-cylinder, two-stroke, air-cooled, oil injected, dual rotary valve. While other manufactures had utilised {{the advantages of}} rotary <b>disc</b> <b>valve</b> induction on small single-cylinder machines, only Kawasaki and Bridgestone produced twin-cylinder machines. Rotary <b>disc</b> <b>valve</b> induction ensures that the all the fuel charge is used and not partly lost (as in a piston ported engine). As a result, it produces more power, more torque at low revs and better response throughout the rev range. The engine's initial air supply began in an air filter canister below the seat and was drawn through a large plenum chamber just above the transmission and behind the cylinder head, then down into the internal passages leading to the carburetor housing feeding the carburetors.|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjectives: To {{evaluate}} midterm {{results of}} mechanical valves in pulmonary position {{in patients with}} pulmonary regurgitation and right ventricular dysfunction {{as an alternative to}} bioprostheses. Patients: Mechanical <b>valves</b> (six tilting <b>disc</b> <b>valves</b> and two bileaflet valves) were implanted in eight patients previously operated on for tetralogy of Fallot (n = 7) and truncus arteriosus (n = 1), with severe right ventricular dysfunction caused by massive pulmonary regurgitation. Results: All patients survived prosthesis implantation and are currently well. At follow-up (3 months to 9 years), they do not show signs of valve failure, and right ventricular function has dramatically improved in all but one, who still shows moderate ventricular hypokinesia. Conclusion: After operative correction of congenital heart defects in selected patients who show severe dysfunction of the right ventricle caused by pulmonary regurgitation/stenosis, mechanical valves may represent an alternative to bioprosthetic valves. The selection of the valve type is still a matter of debate. However, according to literature data, complications seem to have occurred only in patients with bileaflet mechanical valves in the pulmonary position, whereas no thromboembolic episodes or valve failure is reported in subjects with tilting <b>disc</b> <b>valves</b> in the right ventricular outflow. Tilting <b>disc</b> <b>valves</b> might perform better in the right ventricular outflow than bileaflet valves. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1998; 115 : 1074 - 9...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{the use of}} {{electronic}} throttle <b>valve</b> <b>systems</b> has been very popular in the automotive industry. It is used to regulate the amount of air flow into the engine.

In {{the first part of this}} paper the electronic throttle <b>valve</b> <b>system</b> is presented first, and then the model is derived for each components of the throttle <b>valve</b> <b>system.</b> Later, the system dimension is reduced to two by ignoring the motor inductance at the end of this part of work.

50|$|The {{engine was}} a unique {{straight}} twin, two-stroke, air-cooled, oil-injected, dual rotary <b>disc</b> <b>valve.</b> The engine's ignition air supply began in an air filter canister below the seat and was pulled through a large plenum chamber just above the transmission and behind the cylinder head then downward into the two internal passages leading to the carburetor housing feeding the carburetors.
