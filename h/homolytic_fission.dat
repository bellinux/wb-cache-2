Determination of the radical concentration from the EPR spectra permitted to calculate free dissociation energies Delta G(Diss) (295) as well as dissociation enthalpies Delta H-Diss and entropies Delta S-Diss, respectively. Large positive values of Delta G(Diss) (295) indicate that the degree of dissociation is in most cases low, and the concentration of persistent radicals - even if they are spectroscopically observable at ambient temperature - remains small. Appreciable dissociation was established only for the sterically highly congested acyclic derivative { 9 }(2). Analysis of the trends in experimental data in connection with DFT studies indicate that radical formation is favoured by large entropy contributions and the energetic effect of structural relaxation (geometrical distortions and conformational changes in acyclic derivatives) in the radicals, and disfavoured by attractive dispersion forces. Comparison of the energetics of formation for CC-saturated N-heterocyclic diphosphanes and the 7 pi-radical 3 c indicates that the effect of energetic stabilization by pi-electron delocalization in the latter is visible, but stands back behind those of steric and entropic contributions.

30|$|Thermal {{decomposition}} of peroxides proceeds mostly through the <b>homolytic</b> <b>fission</b> of the O-O bond (Swern 1972), {{as a consequence}} of the low dissociation energy of this bond. Cobaltous ion assists the {{decomposition of}} hydroperoxide into alkoxyl radical (Yamada et al. 1984). The rate of hydroperoxide decomposition increases at elevated pH (Rolewski et al. 2009). Hydroperoxides formed during oxidation of lipid represent stable intermediates, therefore, their detection indicates the initial lipid oxidation (Rolewski et al. 2009). The amount of monohydroperoxides decreases with increasing temperature due to the faster degradation of monohydroperoxides (Haslbeck et al. 1983). Linseed oil produces hydroperoxide at abundances one order of magnitude higher than linoleic acid due to a large modal content of linolenic acid in linseed oil (Rolewski et al. 2009).|$|E

To encompass the protective effects of selenium and vitamin E and to explain other toxicological aspects of methylmercury and other alkyhnetals, a new hypothesis is proposed: The toxicity of the alkylmetals is not caused solely by the intact molecule, but also Involves free radicals formed by <b>homolytic</b> <b>fission</b> of the carbon-metal bond...|$|E

Incubation of purified carrier proteins for the thyroid hormones in human serum as well as of an extract of rat liver nuclei or of whole nuclei with trace amounts of 125 I- or 14 C-labeled hormone, followed by irradiation, resulted in covalent binding.

40|$|This brief review will be {{concerned}} with heterolytic cleavages of carbon— silicon and related bonds, and will concentrate on some more recent investi-gations by the author and his co-workers. The C—Si bond is fairly stable towards <b>homolytic</b> <b>fission,</b> and under free radical conditions the C—H bonds of organosilicon compounds are usually more readily attacked than the C—Si bonds 1. The C—Si bond is moderately polar, however, (Pauling electronegativities indicate that there is 12 % ionic character in the direction CSi+), and is relatively easily attacked by ionic reagents. Since C—H bonds break heterolytically in the same direction, C-Hf, a good indication of the behaviour of an R—Si bond {{can be obtained by}} considering the reactions of the corresponding R—H bond 2. For example, just as the C—H bond of chloroform, HCC 13, is readily broken by attack of hydroxide ion on the hydrogen atom, so the Si—C bond of the compound Me 3 SiCC 13 is broken, even more readily, in alkali, by nucleophilic attack at silicon. Again, just as aryl—H bonds are broken readily by electrophilic reagents such as bromine or sulphur trioxide, so aryl—SiMe 3 bonds are also broken readily by these reagents. It is usually but not always true that an R—SiMe 3 bond is more reactive than the corresponding R—H bond towards ionic reagents...|$|E

Dealkylative fission of the carbon–sulfur bond was found to be an important dissociative channel in the fragmentation patterns of 1 and related compounds, including cysteinylhydroquinone (2), 4 -S-cysteaminylphenol (3) and 4 -S-cysteaminylcatechol (4) under electron impact conditions.

30|$|Austen et al. (1966) offer three {{possibilities}} for the origin of radicals in coal. Firstly, stable radicals {{are associated with the}} original organic matter and survive coalification. The radicals form as a result of enzymatic reactions, as well as the oxidation of organic matter during diagenesis. However, since radicals in the initial organic matter would mostly be localized on oxygen atoms, which are progressively expelled during coalification, it is unlikely that these are present in coal of bituminous rank (Austen et al. 1966). Indeed, with an increase in maturity from lignite to bituminous coal, the proportion of radicals localized on oxygen atoms is decreased (Austen et al. 1966). Radicals in such coals may instead be associated with carbon atoms, as molecular products of reactions related to oxygen expulsion (Austen et al. 1966). Secondly, the radicals form due to an increase in temperature during coalification (Austen et al. 1966; Qiu et al. 2007). The decomposition of methyl and methoxyl, hydroxyl, and carboxyl functional groups through <b>homolytic</b> <b>fission</b> with methane, water, and carbon dioxide as products respectively, results in the formation of radical species. The radicals are subsequently immobilized by the coal structure (Austen et al. 1966; Retcofsky et al. 1968). As the aromatic structure grows with increasing rank, bond breakage is also enhanced and the stable structure required to accommodate and shield the radicals is progressively established. The final mechanism proposed by Austen et al. (1966) is also related to a temperature rise. Radioactive decay of elements within mineral constituents of coal provides the heat required for the breaking of bonds in the organic fraction, resulting in the formation of radicals (Austen et al. 1966). All these three radical-generating processes, so far as they are related to homolytic bond fission during coalification, have subsequently been supported by others (e.g., Retcofsky et al. 1968; Kwan and Yen 1979; Krevelen 1993).|$|E
40|$|Part I; DNA and Higher Order Cell Systems The {{effects of}} a range of nitroxides on the {{radiation}} damage routes in frozen aqueous DNA have been studied by comparison with nitroxide free systems. The results show that nitroxides affect the yield of both primary and secondary radicals in this system. The differences between the effects of the nitroxides studied are attributed to steric effects. A range of spin-labelled polyanmionium cations (PACs) have been used to probe the motion of PACs when they are complexed with DNA. The results suggest that PACs experience virtually free movement along the DNA backbone. The effects of one of these spin-labelled PACs on irradiated frozen aqueous DNA have been studied. The results show that constraining the nitroxide group to be close to the DNA by attaching it to a PAC increases the effect of the nitroxide on irradiated DNA at low temperatures. At higher temperatures the spin-labelled PAC is less effective and it is proposed that this is due to less efficient diffusion of the spin-labelled PAC. The effects of 7 -irradiation on frozen aqueous chicken erythrocyte chromatin and cell nuclei have also been studied in the presence and absence of oxygen. Different yields of both primary and secondary radicals are observed. The results show that the routes of radiation damage in frozen aqueous DNA are affected by the presence of histone proteins and higher order DNA-protein structures. Part II: Radicals Formed by Mechanical Damage to Bone The formation of radicals in compact bone (bovine), demineralized bone protein, and collagen by crushing at 77 K has been studied by comparison to the radicals formed by 7 -irradiation.

40|$|B 12 -dependent methylmalonyl-CoA mutase catalyzes the {{isomerization}} of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA in {{the degradation}} of odd-chain fatty acids, branched-chain amino acids and cholesterol to energetically useful metabolites. Dysfunction of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder leading to methylmalonic aciduria, manifested by elevated levels of methylmalonic acid. ^ The first step in AdoCbl-dependent enzyme reactions {{is believed to be}} the <b>homolytic</b> <b>fission</b> of the Co-C bond of the cofactor to generate a carbon-centered deoxyadenosyl radical and an unpaired electron on the cobalt atom. Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase accelerates the homolysis step 1012 -fold in the presence of substrate. ^ The main objective of this study was to evaluate the contribution of select active site residues, that interact with the cofactor and the substrate, to the tremendous enhancement of the homolysis rate and to the stabilization of the highly reactive radical intermediates formed during catalysis. To this end we have examined the effect of the dimethylbenzimidazole displacement from the cobalt by a histidine residue, H 610 upon binding of the cofactor to the mutase. Our mutational studies show that H 610 plays a structural role in organizing the cofactor binding site and in catalyzing the dimethylbenzimidazole displacement, in a step preceding cofactor binding. ^ We have also evaluated the contribution of Y 89 residue to the enhancement of the Co-C bond homolysis rate. From kinetic studies on the mutants Y 89 F and Y 89 A we have estimated that 103 - 104 -fold contribution to the homolysis rate is brought about by this residue. ^ We have also examined the contribution of R 207, which is in hydrogen-bond contact with the substrate carboxylate to the mutase catalyzed reaction, by evaluating the properties of the R 207 Q mutant. Loss of this hydrogen-bonding interaction has a profound effect in catalysis and substrate binding. We also reported in this study the first example of suicide inactivation of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase by an undesired internal electron transfer from the cob(II) alamin intermediate, in an oxygen-independent process. Together these studies have enhanced our understanding of how specific active site residues modulate binding or catalysis and suppress unwanted side reactions in methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{oxidation}} of {{a series}} of aromatic hydrocarbons and ethers by cobaltic perchlorate has been investigated. This was undertaken a. to extend the range of known one-electron oxidations of organic compounds to include much less reactive molecules than those previously investigated; and b. to investigate the possibility of oxidation by direct electron transfer, rather than by the <b>homolytic</b> <b>fission</b> of a CâââH bond. The oxidations studied were (generally much slower than any previously investigated cobaltic oxidations, so that the self-decomposition of the cobaltic ions in solution was often of comparable rate. The latter reaction shows no simple order with respect to cobaltic ions, and is not accurately reproducible. The oxidations {{of a series}} of arossatic hydrocarbons approximately follow the rate law: (i.) - d[Co III]/dt = k 2 [Co III][ArH]/[H +] In many cases the kinetic form is complicated by variations in the extent of secondary oxidation. However, there is no exact comparison between the deviations from a first order dependence on substrate and oxidant, and the variation of stoichiometry with substrate concentration. The approximate reactivity order is: p-NO 2 C 6 H 4 Me The oxidation of di-isopropyl ether is slower than the oxidations of the bensyl ethers. Larger yields of acetone are obtained than {{can be explained by the}} stoichiometry of a reaction scheme analogous to that shown in equations v. to viii. This indicates that there is a short regenerative chain: (v.) Me 2 Ċ OPr i ⟶ Me 2 CO + Pr i• (vi.) Pr i• + Me 2 CHOPr i ⟶ Me 2 Ċ OPr i + C 3 H 8 which ran produce acetone without consumption of cobaltic ions. The oxidation of 2, 2 '- dichlorodiethyl ether is autocatalytic, and liberates chloride ions. The autocatalysis is ascribed to the rearrangement of an intermediate radical to yield chloride ions which are then oxidised to Cl •, or else to elimination of Cl • from the primary radical. The Cl • radicals can then attack the substrate ether. The substrates which have been investigated are all rather insoluble, and so solutions containing high concentrations of methyl cyanide co-solvent were necessary. The increase in the oxidation rates of the hydrocarbons and ethers with increasing methyl cyanide concentration is far too large to fit the expression: (xi.) k = k o e MX (where X is % methyl cyanide v/v) which has been previously found satisfactory for solutions of up to 50 % methyl cyanide. Spectral changes indicate that a cobaltic-methyl cyanide complex, which is an active oxidant, is formed. Its enhanced reactivity is due to a decrease in the energy of activation for the oxidations, which outweighs the effect of a less favourable activation entropy. In general, the thesis shows that reaction mechanisms cannot be elucidated solely from a knowledge of reaction kinetics. Accurate measurements of reaction products are also necessary before any interpretation of mechanism can be attempted. Thus, similar kinetic behaviour is found a. when the same substrate is oxidised to give different products under different conditions; and b. when similar substrates are oxidised by quite different routes. </p...|$|E
