5|$|The Abbey Shield was {{designed}} by Pierre de Chaignon la Rose of Harvard University. It incorporates the personal coat of Saint Anselm of Canterbury and the first seal {{of the state of}} New Hampshire. In 1927, by a monastic vote, the shield design was incorporated as the official shield of Saint Anselm Abbey and the college. The drops in each quadrant represent the three <b>drops</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> on Anselm's coat of arms, and the sheaf of five arrows is taken from the first shield of the State of New Hampshire, representing the five original counties of the state. Hence, the Abbey Shield has been interpreted as Saint Anselm of New Hampshire.|$|E

25|$|Fyodor Sologub was {{the first}} writer to {{introduce}} the morbid, pessimistic elements characteristic of fin de siècle literature and philosophy into Russian prose. His most famous novel, The Petty Demon (1902), {{was an attempt to}} create a living portrait of the concept known in Russian as poshlost' (an idea whose meaning lies somewhere between evil, trashy and banality or kitsch). His next large prose work, A Created Legend (a trilogy consisting of <b>Drops</b> <b>of</b> <b>Blood,</b> Queen Ortruda, and Smoke and Ash), contained many of the same characteristics but presented a considerably more positive and hopeful view of the world.|$|E

Oda ruined his chances of a medal by doing an extra triple jump, resulting in a loss of 13 points. Florent Amodio used music with lyrics, which is not allowed in competitive skating with the exception of ice dancing. He was not given the normally required one-point penalty because not enough judges voted for it.|$|E

Kercher's bedroom door was locked, which Knox took as indicating that Kercher was sleeping. After showering in the bathroom she and Kercher shared, Knox found feces in the toilet of the bathroom shared by Romanelli and Mezzetti. Knox went back to Sollecito's home and later returned with him to Via della Pergola7. Noticing a broken window in Romanelli's bedroom and alarmed that Kercher did not answer her door, Sollecito unsuccessfully tried to force the door open. Sollecito called his sister, a lieutenant in the carabinieri, for advice. She advised him to call the 112 emergency number, which he did.|$|E

25|$|Countess Sztáray {{noticed a}} small brown stain above the empress's left breast. Alarmed that Elisabeth had not {{recovered}} consciousness, she informed {{the captain of}} her identity, and the boat turned back to Geneva. Elisabeth was carried back to the Hotel Beau-Rivage by six sailors on a stretcher improvised from a sail, cushions and two oars. Fanny Mayer, {{the wife of the}} hotel director, a visiting nurse, and the countess undressed Elisabeth and removed her shoes, when Sztáray noticed a few small <b>drops</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> and a small wound. When they then removed her from the stretcher to the bed she was clearly dead; Frau Mayer believed the two audible breaths she heard the Empress take as she was brought into the room were her last. Two doctors, Dr. Golay and Dr. Mayer arrived, along with a priest, who was too late to grant her absolution. Mayer incised the artery of her left arm to ascertain death, and found no blood. She was pronounced dead at 2:10p.m. Everyone knelt down and prayed for the repose of her soul, and Countess Sztáray closed Elisabeth's eyes and joined her hands. No matter how reluctant or resentful she was of the title, Elisabeth had been the Empress of Austria for 44 years.|$|E

25|$|After his 2011 arrest, Jaishankar {{was kept}} at the Parappana Agrahara Central Jail in Bangalore. He {{was sentenced to}} 27 years in prison.

After returning, Jaishankar feigned uneasiness and {{was admitted to the}} hospital within the prison premises. He managed to secure a duplicate key and used it at 2 am on 1 September 2013, when the daily change of guards took place. The police suspected that an insider helped him get the duplicate key. He scaled a 20-foot wall, then walked atop a 15-foot wall and finally scaled the 30-foot high compound wall. He managed to cross the electric fence safely, since it was not functional that night. He reportedly carried with him a bamboo pole balancing on the walls and a bedsheet to serve as a cushion over the glass pieces on the wall top. He was injured during the escape, and <b>drops</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> were found outside the outer wall.

500|$|Two stories exist {{around a}} ritual of human {{sacrifice}} that Andriamasinavalona conducted after his imprisonment. In {{one version of}} the oral history, Andriamampandry and his fellow royal advisers were concerned that the king's imprisonment had weakened his authority and could lead the population to revolt against him. They suggested the king test his people by claiming to be ill and requesting a human sacrifice; if a citizen offered his life for the king, this gesture would indicate the public was still loyal to him. Andriamasinavalona followed this recommendation and gathered the people to request a volunteer {{who was willing to}} have his throat slit with a long dagger to sanctify the king. In another version of the story, this proposal was made to sanctify the new Besakana palace that the king ordered rebuilt at the rova in Antananarivo. A man named Trimofoloalina stepped forward to sacrifice his life. In the first version of the story, royal advisers bound him with ropes and laid him on the ground {{to the west of the}} Masoandro palace within the rova compound at Antananarivo, but rather than kill the man they symbolically [...] "sacrificed" [...] him by pouring rooster blood mixed with water onto his throat. In the second, he was bound and hoisted to the top of the central pillar of the new building, and his ear was nicked to allow several <b>drops</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> to fall on the top of the pillar to sanctify it. Trimofoloalina was then released and the king asked him to name a reward for his courageous gesture. The man requested that he and his descendents would forever after be exempted from the death penalty for any crime they might commit; Andriamasinavalona agreed to grant this reward.|$|E

500|$|Subspecies 4: Bloodstorm (1998) {{begins with}} a badly burnt Radu able to find refuge in his crypt. A car {{accident}} takes the lives of everyone but Michelle, who is discovered by a stranger named Ana. Upon seeing Michelle's reaction to the sunlight, Ana takes her body to her former professor, Dr. Nicolescu, who quickly determines that Michelle is a vampire. When Michelle wakes, Dr. Nicolescu promises to cure her of her vampirism. Dr. Nicolescu is a vampire himself, but uses science {{to allow him to}} be immune to vampire weaknesses, with the exception of needing blood, and hopes to use Michelle to get the blood stone and therefore a cure for his condition. With his strength restored, Radu travels to Bucharest to claim the financial wealth one of his previous [...] "fledglings", Ash, who has acquired in the Vladislas. Radu enlists Ash's help to track down Michelle, while Ash's own fledgling, Serena, attempts to play Radu and Ash against each other. Radu discovers Michelle's location, and Dr. Nicolescu agrees to give her to Radu in exchange for three <b>drops</b> <b>of</b> <b>blood</b> from the Bloodstone. Radu agrees, but it was only a trick to allow Dr. Nicolescu the opportunity to capture and stake Radu. Michelle arrives releases Radu, and the two flee to safety. Serena arrives immediately after and gives Ana a key to the Vladislas crypt, where Radu is, with instructions to kill Radu. Ana and Dr. Nicolescu arrive at the tomb, but Radu awakens and kills Nicolescu. Radu turns his attention to Ana, but Michelle slices his throat, allowing Ana enough time to decapitate Radu. They burn his body and take the Bloodstone. Ash and Serena are waiting {{at the opening of the}} crypt, but a caretaker, hearing Ana's screams, opens the crypt and spills sunlight inside.
