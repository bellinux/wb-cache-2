5000|$|Since {{the quality}} of borrowers' {{financial}} positions affect the terms of their credit, changes in financial positions should result in changes to their investment and spending decisions. This idea {{is closely related to}} the financial accelerator. A basic model of the financial accelerator suggests that a firm's spending on a variable input cannot exceed the sum of gross cash flows and net discounted value of assets. This relationship is expressed as a [...] "collateral-in-advance" [...] constraint. An increase in interest rates will tighten this constraint when it is binding; the firm's ability to purchase inputs will be reduced. This can occur in two ways: directly, via increasing interest payments on outstanding debt or floating-rate debt, and decreasing the value of the firm's collateral through decreased asset-prices typically associated with increased interest rates (reducing the net discounted value of the firm's assets); and indirectly, by reducing the demand for a firm's products, which reduces the firm's revenue while its short-run fixed cost do not adjust (lowering the firm's <b>gross</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow).</b> The reduction in revenue relative to costs erodes the firm's net worth and credit-worthiness over time.|$|E

40|$|Beef cattle {{production}} is suffering numerous difficulties in productive and economical {{terms in the}} state of Rio Grande do Sul. Expanding new markets, competition with other meats, external competition through imported Mercosul beef, new growth and slaughter processes bring new challenges to the Brazilian livestock production. In the case of Rio Grande do Sul, another factor to be considered is the competition with Central States in the internal market. Meat prices received by farmers in the last years stayed constant, but prices of the main production inputs are still rising. This scenery brought continuous income decrease to the beef cattle farmers. As a result, many farmers are selling part of their lands or leaving beef {{cattle production}}. This paper aims to compare <b>gross</b> income and <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> in three farms with different beef cattle systems during the years of 2003 and 2004, as well as analysing the cost percentage of different inputs necessary to the production systems. The farms are located in different regions: Campanha, Depressão Central and Fronteira Oeste, representing important agricultural production regions in the in Rio Grande do Sul state. The results show that without technological modernisation in beef cattle production systems and integration with agriculture, it becomes difficult to remunerate all the production factors. Planning allows a better income distribution, reducing the months of negative <b>cash</b> <b>flow.</b> However, the low profit per area demonstrates the gravity of the economical situation of beef cattle farmers in Rio Grande do Sul. beef cattle systems, <b>gross</b> profit, <b>cash</b> <b>flow,</b> Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R

40|$|The thesis investigates {{construction}} project cash flows. It {{is divided into}} two main components. The first investigates the cumulative <b>gross</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> profiles (S curves), and the second examines the cumulative net cash flow profiles. The <b>gross</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model can be used by either construction industry clients or contractors, whereas the net cash flow model concerns the contractor. Interest in {{construction project}} cash flows resulted from changed economic pressures in the 1970 s. A rise in inflation was associated with increased client attention to his gross cash flows to the contractor, and similarly higher interest rates had the effect that contractors became concerned with their net cash flows. An examination of the <b>gross</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> literature found that most models were aimed at discovering generally applicable ideal curves. A similar situation existed within the net cash flow literature. It was argued that the averaging approach is unsuitable for construction project cash flow research, and consequently an approach which concentrates on the individual project was pursued. A <b>gross</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model was developed using logistic transformation regression procedures. This yielded excellent results for post-hoc analysis of individual project data. Furthermore the <b>gross</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model was found to be suitable for the generation of a construction project net cash flow model, which was similarly oriented towards the post-hoc analysis of single projects. A measure of deviation was used which enabled the identification of projects for which the <b>gross</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model was a poor fit. This same procedure was used to exclude projects from the net cash flow analysis. The results from the <b>gross</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model analysis indicate that projects do vary considerably from one to another, and this supports the contention made that an individual approach to this research is necessary. The net cash flow model yields an excellent trend line for net cash flow on a project, and thus provides an excellent means for senior management to judge the quality of management employed on a projectRestricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|E

40|$|A {{field study}} on the {{economic}} performance indicators for coastal fisheries are {{needed in order to}} implement fisheries policy in Khanh Hoa as well as in Vietnam. The research project “Economic performance indicators for coastal fisheries - the case of pure-seining in Khanh Hoa” established to fulfill these demands. A questionnaire about technical characteristics and economic data is used for data collection through interviews with vessel owners. This paper presents preliminary findings for 100 purse seiners, representing 10 % of the total population, in Nha Trang and Cam Ranh (Khanh Hoa province) in the group of vessels with engine power of less than 90 HP. The following indicators are presented: gross revenue, gross value added, <b>gross</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow,</b> net profit and crew share. The results show that the coastal purse seine fishery in Cam Ranh is more profitable than in Nha Trang for each engine power group. The owner of an average purse seiner of all groups of horse power in both locations of Nha Trang and Cam Ranh is not only capable paying for all expenses, but also has a reward for the operating year. The boat owner of an average vessel in the group of horse power of 75 -< 90 Hp has the highest values of annual <b>gross</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and net profit following location. Thus, the annual average of crew shares for this group of horse power was quite high. It was almost 2. 0 times more than the average earnings of labor in the whole country. The boat owners of the engine power group of < 20 Hp and 20 -< 45 Hp have lowest values of annual vessel <b>gross</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and net profit following location. Thus, the annual average of crew shares for those groups of horse power is quite low. They are almost 1. 2 times more than the average earnings of labor in the whole country. Regression analysis of gross revenue using technical characteristics as independent variables is performed, and the results are demonstrated. The technical factors that impact on the gross revenue are the length of net, fishing experience of skipper and location. These are significant factors impacting on the gross revenue.

Dynamic panel models using General Methods of Moments techniques are estimated from an unbalanced sample of firms across the major industrialized economies as well as China and India from 1998 to 2008. Results from the full cross-country panel sample found a significant and positive association between R&D expenditures and sales, net equity issuance and lagged real GDP; a negative association was found with the capital to labor ratio. Macroeconomic growth had a positive impact on R&D expenses in each country but was statistically significant only for firms located in Germany, Great Britain, and the US. Equity capital is found to be a significant source of R&D funding for US firms. However, estimates for non-US firms indicate that capital intensity nor net equity issuance was a consistently significant predictor of R&D expenditures. The latter result may be due to cross-country differences in financial and institutional relationships between capital market and bank-based systems of corporate finance.

40|$|Vietnam’s {{policy is}} to shift the fishing {{pressure}} from onshore to offshore water since the coastal resource has been overexploited, and a programme for investing in offshore vessels has thus been implemented since 1997. The question raised is whether the offshore fishing fleet is profitable and efficient or not? This study aims to evaluate the economic performance and efficiency of the offshore fleet in Vietnam – {{the case of the}} Nha Trang gillnet fishery in open access conditions, based on a costs and earnings survey carried out on the 58 offshore vessels. The empirical results indicate that an average gillnet vessel earns a gross margin profit of 17. 3 % and a profit margin of 3. 8 %, but makes an economic loss, even with the government fuel cost support. The average annual crew income is 74. 5 % more than the local average income per capita. An efficiency analysis of the vessels based on an application of the Salter-diagram shows that the large number of vessels with high relative standardized effort (above 1) is the most cost-efficient scenario for vessels from both a short- and long-term perspective. The majority of these vessels receive intra-marginal rents. The government fuel subsidies help to increase their <b>gross</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> by 17. 5 % and profit by 36 % for an average vessel.

The {{analysis was conducted}} using a data sample of 3976 firms traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ during a 29 year time horizon, from July 1986 to June 2015. Predictive powers of different strategies were also tested during three sub-periods and during bull and bear markets using both long-only and long/short portfolios to check whether the predictive power is robust. It {{was found that the}} FCF yield is a better indicator of future stock returns than the gross profitability. The difference between average monthly returns was significant during all tested time periods and market situations using both long-only and long/short portfolios. The newly introduced FCF profitable value strategy proved to be a better predictor of future stock returns than the profitable value strategy. The FCF profitable value strategy presents also an improvement over the FCF yield strategy. It was found that the FCF profitable value has a better predictive power for future stock returns than the FCF yield at least during some time periods or market situations.

To be included, the farms must have produced at least 50 percent of <b>gross</b> <b>cash</b> farm income from milk and dairy animal sales. The records came from Michigan State University’s TelFarm project and the Farm Credit Service system in Michigan. The values were pooled into averages for reporting purposes. The farms are larger than would be the average dairy farm in Michigan. While considerable variation in the data exists, average values are reported in the summary tables and discussion that follows.

40|$|I {{decompose}} operating <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> {{into two}} components, unmanaged operating <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and managed operating <b>cash</b> <b>flow,</b> {{to examine the}} association between managed operating <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> {{and the cost of}} debt. For all firms the results suggest the cost of debt has a significant negative association with both components of operating <b>cash</b> <b>flow,</b> however, the managed component is less negative. Also, when firms are likely to engage in <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> management and bondholders have increased incentives to scrutinize firm information, the bond market positively prices managed operating <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> information. Specifically, my findings report a positive association between managed operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> and the cost of debt when firms use <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> management to meet the zero operating <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> benchmark. Also, I find a more pronounced positive association between managed operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> for a group of distressed firms...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows how}} to improve {{forecast}} models of expected <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> levels by incorporating measures of historical <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> volatility and other firm characteristics that affect <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> volatility (such as growth and return on assets). Risk management research and theories of underinvestment have linked <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> volatility to investment and resulting <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> levels. Based on these proposed links, we develop a time-series model of <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> in which investment decisions depend on <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> realizations. The model predicts that accuracy and bias of forecasts are improved when <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> volatility and firm characteristics that affect volatility are included as explanatory variables in the forecasting model. Empirical data supports the model's predictions. We implement a profitable trading strategy {{based on these findings}} that suggests that equity market participants do not incorporate fully the information in historical volatility and firm-specific characteristics when forecasting future <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> levels.

40|$|Previous returns {{studies have}} shown that extreme {{earnings}} and extreme <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> from operations are less informative than moderate (i. e., less extreme) earnings and moderate <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> Studies also report that <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> supplement to earnings in firm valuation by showing a higher association of <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> with returns when earnings are extreme than when earnings are moderate. We propose that this supplementary role of <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> is affected by <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> extremity. Using data from the US capital markets, we find that the supplementary role of <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> exists only when <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> are not extreme. We also investigate the supplementary role of earnings to <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> and search for a higher association of earnings with returns when <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> are extreme than when <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> are moderate. Similar to results on <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> our findings show that the supplementary role of earnings exists only when earnings are not extreme. Our results imply that investors and researchers should consider "both" earnings "and" <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> extremity when assessing the information content of these variables.

40|$|<b>Cash</b> <b>flow</b> {{prediction}} {{is an essential}} component of economic decision making, particularly in investment and credit evaluation. This paper examines the comparative predictive ability of earnings and operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> variables on future operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> within a developing economy’s setting. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method is used to develop regression models over the period of 2002 to 2012. Current operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> as proxy for future operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> are regressed on past one, two and three years of earnings and operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> as predictors. Results from the regression analysis reveals earnings and operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> are significant in predicting future operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> but have different predictive powers with earnings providing a superior comparative predictive ability on future <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> The paper therefore concludes that earnings are a better predictor of future operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> than historical operating <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> itself...|$|R

This paper assumes that <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and its stability are important to commodity processors and examines methods for hedging <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> under continuous processing. Its objectives are (a) to determine how standard hedging models should be modified to hedge <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> (b) to outline the differences between <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> hedging and profit hedging, and (c) to determine the effectiveness of hedging in reducing <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> variability. A <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> hedging methodology is developed. This methodology {{is similar to that}} used for batch profit hedging. This methodology balances the daily <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> destabilizing effect of futures positions against the periodic <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> destabilizing effect of cash price changes. The resulting <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> hedges are simulated for soybean processors. These hedges are less effective than batch profit hedging. The reduction in <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> variance achieved through hedging, though small, is nonetheless statistically significant. Agribusiness, Marketing,...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{discounted}} <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> valuation methods. We start {{the paper with}} the simplest case: no-growth, perpetual-life companies. Then we will study the continuous growth case and, finally, the general case. The different concepts of <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> used in company valuation are defined: equity <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> (ECF), free <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> (FCF), and capital <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> (CCF). Then the appropriate discount rate is determined for each <b>cash</b> <b>flow,</b> depending on the valuation method used. Our starting point will be the principle by which {{the value of a}} company's equity is the same, whichever of the four traditional discounted <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> formulae is used. This is logical: given the same expected <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> it would not be reasonable for the equity's value to depend on the valuation method. discounted <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> valuation; <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> valuation; value of tax shields; required return to equity;...|$|R
