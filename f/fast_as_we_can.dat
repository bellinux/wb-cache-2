500|$|In February 2008, {{plans to}} rebuild the bucentaur {{destroyed}} in 1798 were announced. More than 200 shipbuilders, woodcarvers and jewellers started work on 15 March 2008 at the Arsenale. It has been reported by the Italian press {{that it will take}} two years for the bucentaur to be constructed. However, Colonel Giorgio Paterno, the head of Fondazione Bucintoro which is behind the €20million project, said in March 2008 that [...] "e'll build it as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> but we're not in a hurry." [...] It is intended that the project will make use of traditional shipbuilding techniques and original materials, including larch and fir wood, and will reproduce gold decorations. The foundation is supported by businessmen in the Veneto and Lombardy regions but has also written to the French President Nicolas Sarkozy for France to make a financial contribution as a goodwill gesture to compensate for Napoleon's [...] "vandalism" [...] of the 1729 vessel.|$|E

Trust me, the studio would love there to be a script. But our feeling is, we gotta get it right." [...] When asked whether the film would realistically be out within the [...] "next few years", she {{expressed}} confidence that it would be, saying, [...] "Yeah.

40|$|We have {{developed}} {{simple and fun}} “fishing games” which can be played easily and quickly with cheap supplies—and which demonstrate important economic characteristics of fisheries. Players “fish” by scooping beads from a common bowl into individual cups placed near the bowl. The beads are the fish stock; the scoops are the fishing gear, and the cups are the player’s delivery ports. Players pay a rental cost for their gear (scoop), which depends upon the scoop size they choose. They are paid a price for their fish, which depends upon {{the distance of the}} cup from the bowl. If not allowed to communicate, most players compete aggressively to maximize their harvests from the limited total stock of beads by scooping <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> they <b>can.</b> <b>We</b> describe three games which compellingly illustrate three important mechanisms by which rent dissipation may occur in competitive fisheries. The “gear-choice game” illustrates cost-driven rent dissipation as players choose larger, higher-cost scoops rather than the smallest and lowest-cost scoops. The “port-choice game” illustrates value-driven rent dissipation as players deliver beads to a closer but lower-priced cup. The “harvest choice game”—in which the volume left un-harvested each period determines {{the extent to which the}} bead stock is replenished for the next period—illustrates resource-driven rent dissipation as players over-harvest in earlier periods. In all of these games, replacing competitive fishing with individual quotas immediately and dramatically changes player behavior and increases rents. We have found these seemingly simple games to be powerful and effective tools for instruction, outreach, and experimental research...|$|R
