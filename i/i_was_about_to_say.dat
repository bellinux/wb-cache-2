50|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> call State {{troops to}} Denver {{last week a}} {{required}} practice. It did not strike me {{at that time that}} any political significance could be attached to the movement. Finally there was talk of a riot in Denver, and that the Republican party was to call upon the mayor and governor for troops. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in Denver at the time and told the governor it would be a happy coincidence to have the troops in this vicinity in case of trouble, and he agreed with me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> issue the order for mobilization when I began to see that politics was entering into the game.|$|R

50|$|He died on 1 July 1914, just as World War <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> begin; the {{circumstances}} of his death have led some authors to claim that the apparently austrophile general was actually murdered, to make way for Cadorna, who succeeded him as Chief of Staff.|$|R
