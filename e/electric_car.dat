5|$|Dysprosium is used, in {{conjunction}} with vanadium and other elements, in making laser materials and commercial lighting. Because of dysprosium's high thermal-neutron absorption cross-section, dysprosium-oxide–nickel cermets are used in neutron-absorbing control rods in nuclear reactors. Dysprosium–cadmium chalcogenides are sources of infrared radiation, which is useful for studying chemical reactions. Because dysprosium and its compounds are highly susceptible to magnetization, they are employed in various data-storage applications, such as in hard disks. Dysprosium is increasingly in demand for the permanent magnets used in <b>electric</b> <b>car</b> motors and wind turbine generators.|$|E

5|$|Neodymium–iron–boron magnets {{can have}} up to 6% of the {{neodymium}} substituted by dysprosium to raise the coercivity for demanding applications, such as drive motors for electric vehicles and generators for wind turbines.

40|$|Background: The Swedish island Gotland {{provides}} suitable {{conditions for}} the successful implementation of <b>electric</b> <b>cars.</b> Despite these conditions {{and the availability of}} the product in the Gotlandic market, <b>electric</b> <b>cars</b> do not find acceptance among consumers on Gotland. This phenomenon of consumer resistance behavior represents a rather under-researched area in current literature. Since resistance behavior {{is one of the main}} reasons responsible for the high failure rate of innovative products such as <b>electric</b> <b>cars,</b> this justifies the relevance of this study. Purpose: The aim of this study is to explore the reasons for consumer resistance behavior towards <b>electric</b> <b>cars</b> on Gotland. By answering this question, the authors intend to contribute not only theoretically to the existing theory of this phenomenon but also to shed new light on the special case of Gotland regarding the non-adoption of <b>electric</b> <b>cars.</b> Methodology: In order to answer the research question, an exploratory case study approach was chosen. Quantitative data in form of a questionnaire as well as qualitative data including a group interview and six expert interviews were collected and analyzed. Key findings: The barriers preventing consumers on Gotland from adopting <b>electric</b> <b>cars</b> are rooted in four different areas. First, functional barriers occur due to the limited range of <b>electric</b> <b>cars,</b> the existing charging infrastructure, the purchase cost, as well as the technological development status of the car batteries. Second, institutional barriers arise since the local government does not provide sufficient support for the further implementation of <b>electric</b> <b>cars</b> and related issues. Third, a contextual barrier in terms of the local car industry was figured out. This contributes a lot the last identified barrier, the cognitive barrier, which concerns the consumers themselves since their lacking knowledge and awareness about issues related to <b>electric</b> <b>cars</b> on Gotland is one of the main reasons for the resistance towards this innovation. As long as these barriers exist, consumers tend to postpone the buying decision of this product to a future point in time...|$|R
