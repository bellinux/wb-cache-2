Methods Job histories from 219 current workers {{were linked to}} a job-exposure matrix derived from personal exposure measurements of respirable dust and fibers. Univariate group comparisons and multivariate modeling tested for relations between indices of cumulative and current exposure, and respiratory and systemic symptom outcomes. Results Respiratory symptoms and repeated flu-like illnesses were associated with use of compressed air to clear equipment (blow-downs) and with respirable dust exposure (current and cumulative) after controlling for smoking. Blow-downs had an equal or greater effect than smoking status on most symptoms.

The diseases arising from exposures {{to some of these}} fibers include pleural thickening (plaques, diffuse pleural thickening, and calcification), pulmonary fibrosis, lung cancers, mesothelioma of the pleura and peritoneum, and other cancers). Risk factors important in assessing these diseases include assessment of latency, duration of exposure, cumulative exposure, fiber origin and characteristics (length and diameter), other possible confounding occupational or environmental exposures, and smoking. Methodological issues commonly presenting problems in evaluation of these data include assessment of the adequacy of environmental exposures, particularly in regard to fiber identification, distribution, and concentration over the duration of exposure, and the adequacy of study design to detect health effects (disease frequency, latency, and cohort size).

The parameters studied were clearance/biopersistence of inhaled p-aramid RFP or size-separated asbestos fibers as well as pulmonary cell proliferation and inflammation indices after 2 -week inhalation exposures. Rats were exposed nose only to chrysotile asbestos fibers at concentrations of 459 and 782 fibers/ml or to p-aramid RFP at 419 or 772 fibrils/ml. Hamsters were exposed whole body to p-aramid RFP at concentrations of 358 and 659 fibrils/mI.

The morphology and extent of collagen degradation was studied by the Picrosirius red/polarizing microscopy technique. The results of various experiments indicate that collagen present in cryostat sections of both human and rat normal and cirrhotic livers is resistant to trypsin digestion for periods of exposure of up to 48 hours but that heating the sections to 60 C for 1 hour renders the collagen susceptible to degradation by trypsin. Incubation of cryostat liver sections with bacterial collagenase revealed progressive degradation of collagen with a uniform pattern {{of changes in the}} original color and diameter of the <b>fibers.</b> <b>Exposure</b> of liver sections to homologous collagenases gave rise to the same pattern of changes observed with bacterial collagenase, although less extensive when equal incubation periods were compared. Nevertheless, sufficiently prolonged incubation of liver sections with their homologous collagenases eventually showed degradation of all collagen present in all normal and cirrhotic liver sections. These observations suggest that in the presence of non rate-limiting concentrations of homologous collagenase, the susceptibility of hepatic collagen to the corresponding degrading enzyme is probably not responsible for the irreversibility of the disease...|$|R

Materials and methods: Scaled root samples (n = 160) were set in five groups and conditioned with: group I - control group (saline solution); group II (EDTA 24 %); group III (citric acid 25 %); group IV (tetracycline hydrochloride 50 mg/ml); group V (sodium citrate 30 %). Eighty samples were assessed using the root surface modification index (RSMI). The other eighty samples were set in two groups. The first group (n = 40) received PRP gel application with a soft brush and the second group (n = 40) received PRP application and then a blood drop. The fibrin clot formation was assessed in the first group and the blood cells adhesion was assessed in the second group using the BEAI (blood elements adhesion index). A previously trained, calibrated, and blind examiner evaluated photomicrographs. Statistical analysis was performed using the Kruskal-Wallis's and Dunn's tests. Results: Group III attained the best results for RSMI and BEAI. Moreover, it was the only group showing fibrin clot formation.

40|$|A new {{strategy}} to improve silicon-based endodontic treatment tightness by dentine hydrophobization {{is presented in}} this work: root dentine was silanized to obtain a hydrophobic dentine-sealer interface that limits fluid penetration. This strategy {{was based on the}} grafting of aliphatic carbon chains on the dentine through a silanization with the silane end groups [octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) and octadecyltriethoxysilane]. Dentine surface was previously pretreated, applying ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and sodium hypochlorite, to expose hydroxyl groups of collagen for the silane grafting. Collagen <b>fibers</b> <b>exposure</b> after pretreatment was visible with scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy showed their correct exposition for the silanization (amide I and II, with 1630, 1580, and 1538 cm⁻¹ peaks corresponding to the vibration of C=O and C [...] N bonds). The grafting of aliphatic carbon chains was confirmed by FTIR (peaks at 2952 and 2923 cm⁻¹ corresponding to the stretching of C [...] H bonds) and by the increasing of the water contact angle. The most efficient hydrophobization was obtained with OTS in ethyl acetate, with a water contact angle turning from 51 ° to 109 °. Gas and liquid permeability tests showed an increased seal tightness after silanization: the mean gas and water flows dropped from 2. 02 × 10 ⁻⁸ to 1. 62 × 10 ⁻⁸ mol s⁻¹ and from 10. 8 × 10 ⁻³ to 5. 4 × 10 ⁻³ µL min⁻¹, respectively.

30|$|A recent {{demonstration}} of MWCNT-induced mesothelioma in p 53 knockout mice [19, 55] further supports our finding {{and the role}} of p 53 in CNT carcinogenesis. A portion of this response may be due to a weakened p 53 in the BEAS- 2 B cell model since the SV 40 large T antigen immortalization procedure does affect p 53 function [44]. Numerous studies acknowledge that p 53 status is a contributing factor to adverse effects following many different types of inhalable and respirable particle exposure to the lung [34, 36, 38, 39, 43]. In addition, other studies note that a CNT's physicochemical properties and toxicokinetics in combination with p 53 status of exposed tissue determine disease response [56, 57]. Regardless, SWCNT exposure did alter p 53 signaling in these cells compared to B-Control cells.

The data on the human exposures to man-made vitreous fibers are much more complete than the data on asbestos exposure, while exposure data on other man-made fibrous materials are lacking.

Using the recent regional geological cartography, 66 sites of ophiolitic rocks containing asbestos minerals have been investigated using a multidisciplinary approach. Each outcrop has been initially investigated at mesoscopic scale. That has included the description of lithotypes and structures (i. e. faults, shear zones), the geometric characterization of asbestos-bearing veins (e. g. orientation, thickness, frequency, lateral extension [...] ) and the textural and mineralogical characterization of asbestos minerals within the veins (i. e. geometry of mineral, fibers orientation respect to the vein boundaries, color [...] .).

The other system is based upon a fiber-optic Mach-Zehnder modulator and has a bandwidth of 12 GHz, and is limited by the photo receiver. The signals are recorded on commercial digitizing oscilloscopes that have approximately 6 effective bits. The transmission systems use many off-the-shelf components from the telecommunications industry and thus have a high reliability and a moderate cost. Results from recent measurements will be presented. Investigation of the reduction in optical transmission by the <b>fibers</b> during <b>exposure</b> to high dose radiation will also be discussed...|$|R
40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{for measuring}} environmental parameters comprising an optical fiber-based sensor having thermally-induced diffraction gratings therein which are stable {{at very high}} temperatures for many hours. The diffraction gratings are, preferably, formed in an optical <b>fiber</b> by <b>exposure</b> to light from an infrared laser and do not degrade at high temperatures. A system for measuring an environmental parameter includes an optical fiber-based sensor, a light source, and a detector. According to a method of measuring an environmental parameter, the optical fiber-based sensor is positioned within a high-temperature environment having a parameter desired for measurement. The light source directs light into the optical fiber-based sensor. The detector measures the differential diffraction of the light output from the optical fiber-based sensor and determines a value of the environmental parameter based, at least in part, upon a known correlation between the differential diffraction and the environmental parameter.
