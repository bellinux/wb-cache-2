40|$|Photoinduced {{electron}} transfer in organic molecules is an extensively investigated topic {{both because of}} fundamental interest in the photophysics and for applications to artificial photosynthesis. Highly efficient ultrafast {{electron transfer}} from photoexcited conjugated polymers to C 60 has been reported, the back transfer is heavily hindered, thus providing an <b>intrinsic</b> <b>stabilization</b> mechanism of the photogenerated charges. Although an upper limit for the forward electron transfer time of 1 ps has been reported, its detailed time resolution is still missing and is highly needed {{to shed light on}} the photophysics of the charge transfer mechanism. We perform ultrafast experiments on conjugated polymer/C 60 blends with sub- 10 -fs time resolution. We are able to time resolve {{for the first time the}} charge transfer process, obtaining a forward electron transfer time constant τct≈ 45 fs. ...|$|E
40|$|Over a broad {{parameter}} regime, spike-time dependent learning {{leads to}} an <b>intrinsic</b> <b>stabilization</b> of the mean firing rate of the postsynaptic neuron. Subtractive normalization of the synaptic weights (summed over all presynaptic inputs converging on a postsynaptic neuron) follows if, in addition, the mean input rates are identical at all synapses and correlations in the input are translation invariant. In a rate description, stabilization of the postsynaptic firing rate is most easily achieved by a negative correlation term in the learning rule, often called `anti-Hebbian' learning. For spike-based learning, a strict distinction between Hebbian and `anti-Hebbian' rules is no longer possible. Specifically, learning is driven by correlations on the time scale of the learning window which may be positive even though the integral over the learning window is negative. While the negative integral leads to intrinsic rate stabilization, the positive part of the learning window picks up temporal [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{a system of}} diffusion processes that interact through their empirical mean and have a stabilizing force acting on each of them, corresponding to a bistable potential. There are three parameters that characterize the system: {{the strength of the}} <b>intrinsic</b> <b>stabilization,</b> the strength of the external random perturbations, and the degree of cooperation or interaction between them. The latter is the rate of mean reversion of each component to the empirical mean of the system. We interpret this model in the context of systemic risk and analyze in detail the effect of cooperation between the components, that is, the rate of mean reversion. We show that in a certain regime of parameters increasing cooperation tends to increase the stability of the individual agents but it also increases the overall or systemic risk. We use the theory of large deviations of diffusions interacting through their mean field...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Combined quantum {{mechanical}}/molecular mechanical simulations {{have been}} carried out to investigate the origin of the carbon acidity enhancement in the alanine racemization reaction catalyzed by alanine racemase (AlaR). The present study shows that the enhancement of carbon acidity of R-amino acids by the cofactor pyridoxal 5 ′-phosphate (PLP) with an unusual, unprotonated pyridine is mainly due to solvation effects, in contrast to the <b>intrinsic</b> electron-withdrawing <b>stabilization</b> by the pyridinium ion to form a quinonoid intermediate. Alanine racemase further lowers the R-proton acidity and provides an overall 14 - 17 kcal/mol transition-state stabilization. The second key finding {{of this study is that}} the mechanism of racemization of an alanine zwitterion in water is altered from an essentially concerted process to a stepwise reaction by formation of an external aldimine adduct with the PLP cofactor. Finally, we have used a centroid path integral method to determine the intrinsic kinetic isotope effects for the two proton abstraction reactions, which are somewhat greater than the experimental estimates...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{recognized}} {{evidence for}} the importance of the multifidus muscle in stabilizing the lumbar spine, identifying subjects at risk for injury and subsequent loss of <b>intrinsic</b> spinal <b>stabilization</b> remains difficult. Previous research has failed to associate multifidus muscle size and height, weight, or body mass index (BMI). The {{purpose of this study was}} to begin to establish normative data for the multifidus muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) at the L 5 level and to identify factors associated with size. Twenty-five participants (17 female), with a mean age of 32. 5 (SD 11. 6) years without history of LBP were considered for inclusion. Participants' height and weight were recorded and BMI calculated. Ultrasound imaging was used to obtain a CSA in cm 2 of the subjects' multifidus muscles at the L 5 level bilaterally; testing was done by two trained testers. Prior to testing, intra- and inter-tester reliability were determined. Percent body fat was determined using a three-site skinfold caliper measurement, also using two trained testers. Mean BMI was 24. 18 and mean body fat (%) was 22. 88 for all participants. As expected, age and BMI were moderately correlated. Left and right multifidus muscle CSA were highly correlated (r = 0. 92, p < 0. 001). The mixed model ANOVA indicated a significant main effect for gender as males exhibited larger CSA than females. Participants without history of low back pain present with symmetrical multifidus muscle CSA at the L 5 level. Clear gender differences in CSA show that males tend to have larger multifidus muscles at the L 5 level, indicating a need to establish gender-specific norms for clinicians examining the L 5 multifidus muscle...|$|R
40|$|A {{promising}} {{approach for}} anticancer strategies is the stabilization of telomeric DNA into a G-quadruplex structure. To explore the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>stabilization</b> of folded G-quadruplexes, we combined electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, ion mobility spectrometry, and molecular modeling studies to study different DNA sequences known to form quadruplexes. Two telomeric DNA sequences of different lengths and two DNA sequences {{derived from the}} NHE III 1 region of the c-myc oncogene (Pu 22 and Pu 27) were studied. NH 4 + and the ligands PIPER, TMPyP 4, and the three quinacridines MMQ 1, MMQ 3, and BOQ 1 were complexed with the DNA sequences to determine their effect on {{the stability of the}} G-quadruplexes. Our results demonstrate that G-quadruplex intramolecular folds are stabilized by NH 4 + cations and the ligands listed. Furthermore, the ligands can be classified according to their ability to stabilize the quadruplexes and end stacking is shown to be the dominant mode for ligand attachment. In all cases our solvent-free experimental observations and theoretical modeling reveal structures that are highly relevant to the solution-phase structures. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{structures}} and interconversion pathway between the [Cu- 2 (mu-eta(2) :eta(2) -O- 2) ](2 +) and [Cu- 2 (mu-O) (2) ](2 +) isomers of model systems with three ammonia ligands per copper center are investigated using both density functional theory with a B 3 LYP functional (B 3 LYP-DFT) and multiconfigurational perturbation theory (CASSCF/CASPT 2). Both methods lead to thoroughly different {{results for the}} relative energy of both isomers. The CASPT 2 results reveal an <b>intrinsic</b> <b>stabilization</b> of the [Cu- 2 (mu-O) (2) ](2 +) isomer, thus indicating {{that the presence of}} a [Cu- 2 (mu-eta(2) :eta(2) -O- 2) ](2 +) core in the respiratory proteins must be brought back to the presence of bulky capping ligands and/or to external effects caused by solvents and counterions. Both isomers are found to be diamagnetic. For the [Cu- 2 (mu-eta(2) :eta(2) -O- 2) ](2 +) isomer an antiferromagnetic coupling constant, - 2 J, of 4209 cm(- 1) is calculated at the CASPT 2 level. On the other hand, in the [Cu- 2 (mu-O) (2) ](2 +) isomer, the lowest B- 3 (u) state is calculated at 9316 cm(- 1), but is found to correspond instead to an oxygen pi* [...] > sigma* excitation. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|We study {{analytically}} a {{model of}} long-term synaptic plasticity where synaptic changes are triggered by presynaptic spikes, postsynaptic spikes, and the time dierences between presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes. The changes due to correlated input and output spikes are quanti- ed {{by means of a}} learning window. We show that plasticity can lead to an <b>intrinsic</b> <b>stabilization</b> of the mean ring rate of the postsynaptic neuron. Subtractive normalization of the synaptic weights (summed over all presynaptic inputs converging on a postsynaptic neuron) follows if, in addition, the mean input rates and the mean input correlations are identical at all synapses. If the integral over the learning window is positive, ring-rate stabilization requires a non-Hebbian component, whereas such a component is not needed, if the integral of the learning window is negative. A negative integral corresponds to `anti-Hebbian' learning in a model with slowly varying ring rates. For spike-based learning, a strict distinction between Hebbian and `anti-Hebbian' rules is questionable since learning is driven by correlations on the time scale of the learning window. The correlations between presynaptic and postsynaptic ring are evaluated for a piecewise-linear Poisson model and for a noisy spiking neuron model with refractoriness. While a negative integral over the learning window leads to intrinsic rate stabilization, the positive part of the learning window picks up spatial and temporal correlations in the input...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Although APOBEC 3 G {{protein is}} a potent and innate anti-HIV- 1 {{cellular}} factor, HIV- 1 Vif counteracts the effect of APOBEC 3 G by promoting its degradation through proteasome-mediated proteolysis. Thus, any means that could prevent APOBEC 3 G degradation could potentially enhance its anti-viral effect. The UBA 2 domain {{has been identified as}} an <b>intrinsic</b> <b>stabilization</b> signal that protects protein from proteasomal degradation. In this pilot study, we tested whether APOBEC 3 G, when it is fused with UBA 2, can resist Vif-mediated proteasomal degradation and further inhibit HIV- 1 infection. Results APOBEC 3 G-UBA 2 fusion protein is indeed more resistant to Vif-mediated degradation than APOBEC 3 G. The ability of UBA 2 domain to stabilize APOBEC 3 G was diminished when polyubiquitin was over-expressed and the APOBEC 3 G-UBA 2 fusion protein was found to bind less polyubiquitin than APOBEC 3 G, suggesting that UBA 2 stabilizes APOBEC 3 G by preventing ubiquitin chain elongation and proteasome-mediated proteolysis. Consistently, treatment of cells with a proteasome inhibitor MG 132 alleviated protein degradation of APOBEC 3 G and APOBEC 3 G-UBA 2 fusion proteins. Analysis of the effect of APOBEC 3 G-UBA 2 fusion protein on viral infectivity indicated that infection of virus packaged from HEK 293 cells expressing APOBEC 3 G-UBA 2 fusion protein is significantly lower than those packaged from HEK 293 cells over-producing APOBEC 3 G or APOBEC 3 G-UBA 2 mutant fusion proteins. Conclusion Fusion of UBA 2 to APOBEC 3 G can {{make it more difficult to}} be degraded by proteasome. Thus, UBA 2 could potentially be used to antagonize Vif-mediated APOBEC 3 G degradation by preventing polyubiquitination. The stabilized APOBEC 3 G-UBA 2 fusion protein gives stronger inhibitory effect on viral infectivity than APOBEC 3 G without UBA 2. </p...|$|E
