For any awfs on a category with an initial object, cofibrant replacement forms a comonad, and the category of (left) weak maps associated to the awfs is by definition the Kleisli category of this comonad. We exhibit categories of weak maps as a kind of "homotopy category", that freely adjoins a section for every "acyclic fibration" (= right map) of the awfs; and using this characterisation, we give an alternate <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>categories</b> of weak maps in terms of spans with left leg an acyclic fibration.

40|$|This paper {{checks the}} Balkan and {{neighboring}} languages for a lesser-studied field of grammar, the volitional moods. One {{aim is to}} advance the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>categories</b> in this field. The uses of a particular syntactic construction in the languages of South-Eastern Europe, involving a complemen-tizer heading a main clause are scrutinized. The authors argue that such constructions serve similar meanings in South-Eastern Europe, which becomes evident as they compare the meanings with the meaning of parallel construction in the Western Romance languages. To do this, they employ a paradigm-based approach to volitional mood, which centers around the categories “optative”, “imperative”, “hortative”, “exhortative”, “cohortative”, and combinations of these. Finally, they connect the complementizer-headed main clauses to the well-known phenomenon of infinitive regression in the Balkan languages. 1. The phenomenon The construction we discuss is a main clause headed by a complementizer. The meanings of this construction belongs to what we call “volitional mood”, viz.

40|$|Abstract T {{cell therapy}} {{represents}} an emerging and promising modality {{for the treatment}} of both infectious disease and cancer. Data from recent clinical trials have highlighted the potential for this therapeutic modality to effect potent anti-tumor activity. Biomarkers, operationally defined as biological parameters measured from patients that provide information about treatment impact, {{play a central role in}} the development of novel therapeutic agents. In the absence of information about primary clinical endpoints, biomarkers can provide critical insights that allow investigators to guide the clinical development of the candidate product. In the context of cell therapy trials, the definition of biomarkers can be extended to include a description of parameters of the cell product that are important for product bioactivity. This review will focus on biomarker studies as they relate to T cell therapy trials, and more specifically: i. An overview and <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>categories</b> and classes of biomarkers that are specifically relevant to T cell therapy trials, and ii.

The purpose of this research provide a comparative <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>categories</b> of "guilt", "shame", "disgrace". Scientific and practical significance of the research lies in the fact that comparative studies of this nature help to reach a balance between the studied categories. The author uses an analytical, logical, philosophical and comparative- historical methods. The article analyzes the correlation of categories "guilt", "shame", "disgrace". The author concludes that shame and guilt have a different source of origin, are experienced differently by the individual, but may be tested simultaneously. Tradition shame is the most severe form of atonement, as a devotee must demonstrate publicly shame shame for their actions and apologize to the public. The results of this study provide scientific and practical value, since they can be used in teaching students of legal and philosophical disciplines and practitioners of the judicial and penal systems to achieve the purpose of maximum efficiency of the criminal punishment.

40|$|Semantic feature norms (e. g., STIMULUS: car → RESPONSE:) are {{commonly}} used in cognitive psychology to look into salient aspects of given concepts. Semantic features are typically collected in experimental settings and then manually annotated by the researchers into feature types (e. g., perceptual features, taxonomic features, etc.) by means of content analyses-that is, by using taxonomies of feature types and having independent coders perform the annotation task. However, {{the ways in which}} such content analyses are typically performed and reported are not consistent across the literature. This constitutes a serious methodological problem that might undermine the theoretical claims based on such annotations. In this study, we first offer a review of some of the released datasets of annotated semantic feature norms and the related taxonomies used for content analysis. We then provide theoretical and methodological insights in relation to the content analysis methodology. Finally, we apply content analysis to a new dataset of semantic features and show how the method should be applied in order to deliver reliable annotations and replicable coding schemes. We tackle the following issues: (1) taxonomy structure, (2) the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>categories,</b> (3) coder training, and (4) sustainability of the coding scheme-that is, comparison of the annotations provided by trained versus novice coders. The outcomes of the project are threefold: We provide methodological guidelines for semantic feature classification; we provide a revised and adapted taxonomy that can (arguably) be applied to both concrete and abstract concepts; and we provide a dataset of annotated semantic feature norms...|$|E

During focused coding, the most significant categories that best demonstrated the data underlying cognitive processes of students were identified. Then, I used axial coding to compare different categories and subcategories across the data to establish connections among them. To develop the common pattern of processes involved in GPT, I reviewed the codes developed during first cycle of coding, focused coding, and axial coding to explore the commonality and variations among the categories and subcategories to describe the network of interrelationships from the data. As the main relationships among categories and subcategories were evolved and recognized, I started writing memos underlying each category, subcategory, and their interrelationships to find the main theme underlying wide range of the processes students applied in both tasks differently. Then, I sorted memos to do theoretical integration of emerging categories to refine comparisons among those relationships to construct the common pattern grounded in data drawn from GPT. I also used diagramming to provide a visual <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>categories</b> and subcategories to integrate them into one coherent model. I also moved {{back and forth between}} writing memos and drawing diagrams to realize where each category had a strong or weak relation to each subcategory and made attempt to refine the interrelationships underlying emerging processes in both tasks separately. Writing memos, sorting them, and drawing diagrams informed me a common pattern among the six major categories and 16 subcategories in GPT representing the cognitive processes in which participants were engaged to complete the task.|$|E
40|$|Na atualidade, a esquizofrenia é um dos principais problemas de saúde pública e afeta, além dos pacientes, os seus {{familiar}}es, causando inúmeros prejuízos funcionais e sociais. A esquizofrenia é definida como uma doença que afeta a zona central do eu e altera toda a estrutura vivencial da pessoa. O esquizofrênico representa o estereótipo do louco, um indivíduo que produz grande estranheza social devido ao seu desprezo para com a realidade reconhecida. Cada grupo social {{define a}} esquizofrenia de acordo com seus conhecimentos, crenças e ações específicas. A família tem um lugar e função central na vida dos portadores de esquizofrenia. A confirmação do diagnóstico e o início da doença constituem alguns dos fatores que geram inúmeras mudanças no contexto familiar. Assim, constituiu-se objeto deste estudo apreender o sentido dado pela família acerca do processo de adoecimento do portador de esquizofrenia e os mecanismos para lidar com a doença. Trata-se de um estudo de caso etnográfico, fundamentado no referencial da teoria sistêmica familiar e da antropologia médica, realizado no período de agosto a dezembro de 2005. Participaram do estudo uma família composta por pai, mãe, cinco filhos, dos quais quatro são portadores de esquizofrenia, em seguimento no Núcleo de Saúde Mental do Centro de Saúde Escola da Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirão Preto da Universidade de São Paulo. Os dados foram obtidos por meio da observação, análise dos prontuários, registros no diário de campo e entrevistas gravadas realizadas com a família, em sua maioria, no domicílio. Para a apresentação dos dados utilizamos o genograma, história familiar, análise do sistema familiar e descrição das categorias obtidas nas entrevistas. A partir da construção do genograma, pode-se conhecer a estrutura interna da família. A análise do sistema familiar permitiu descrever além da estrutura, seu funcionamento e desenvolvimento. As entrevistas foram transcritas e submetidas a uma análise de conteúdo latente. A análise das entrevistas permitiu identificar sete categorias temáticas relacionadas ao sentido dado ao processo de adoecimento e aos mecanismos de enfrentamento da família. As categorias referem-se às representações sobre o normal e o patológico, as representações do termo esquizofrenia, as explicações para a doença, o impacto relacionado ao sofrimento, à sobrecarga, ao isolamento social e às tarefas da cuidadora, às modificações no relacionamento familiar, o tratamento e a cura. Para a família em estudo, o adoecimento dos filhos causou um rompimento em sua trajetória de vida. O impacto da esquizofrenia foi revelado pelos familiares mediante a manifestação de sentimentos de tristeza, isolamento social e sobrecarga. Os resultados nos levam a considerar que a assistência ao doente mental constitui um desafio para os profissionais de saúde. Torna-se necessário e urgente incluir a família como unidade de cuidado, além de garantir a manutenção do tratamento farmacológico e a reabilitação psicossocial. On the present days, schizophrenia {{is one of}} the most important problems on public health which affects not only the patients, but also their families, causing many functional and social losses. Schizophrenia is defined as an illness that affects the id central zone and changes all persons living structure. The schizophrenic illrepresents the stereotype of the crazy one, an individual who causes huge social oddness due to his/her despisal to the known reality. Each social group defines schizophrenia according to their knowledge, beliefs and specific actions. Family has a place and a central function on the life of the schizophrenic ill. The diagnostic confirmation and the illness beginning are some of the events that create a number of changes on the family context. Therefore, the objective of this study is learning both the sense given by the family to the illness development process and the facing mechanisms to deal with schizophrenia. This is an ethnographic case study based on the reference of the family systemic theory and medical anthropology, conducted during August through December of 2005. A family composed by father, mother and five kids, four of which are schizophrenic, being followed at the Núcleo de Saúde Mental do Centro de Saúde Escola da Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirão Preto da Universidade de São Paulo. Data were obtained by observation, review of medical registry, camp diary notes and recorded interviews carried out with the family what, mostly happened at their home. A genogram, family history, family system analysis and <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>categories</b> from the interviews were used to present the data. From the building of the genogram, one can know the familys internal structure. The family system analysis allowed describing not only the structure, but the function and development. The interviews were transcribed and submitted to a latent content analysis. The interview analysis allowed pointing seven thematic categories related to the sense given to the illness process and the facing mechanisms used by the family. The categories refer to representation about what is normal and pathologic, representations of the term schizophrenia, explanations to the disease, the impact on suffering, overload, social isolation and tasks for the care taker, changes in family, the treatment and cure. For the studied family, the children illness has caused a break up to their life way. The impact of schizophrenia was shown by the family members by manifesting feelings of sadness, social isolation and overload. The results lead us to thinking that the assistance to the mentally ill brings a challenge to health care professionals. To include the family as a care unit, besides assuring the pharmacology treatment and psycho-social rehabilitation, becomes necessary and urgent...|$|E
