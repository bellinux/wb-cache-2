The silt load has been estimated at 80,000 tonnes per year with 70% contribution from the Telabal nallah, with 36,000 tonnes recorded as settling in the lake.|$|E
5|$|Although lithium {{is widely}} {{distributed}} on Earth, {{it does not}} naturally occur in elemental form due to its high reactivity. The total lithium content of seawater is very large and is <b>estimated</b> <b>as</b> 230 billion tonnes, where the element exists at a relatively constant concentration of 0.14 to 0.25 parts per million (ppm), or 25 micromolar; higher concentrations approaching 7 ppm are found near hydrothermal vents.|$|E

5|$|The bonding in boron {{has been}} {{described}} as being characteristic of behaviour intermediate between metals and nonmetallic covalent network solids (such as diamond). The energy required to transform B, C, N, Si and P from nonmetallic to metallic states has been <b>estimated</b> <b>as</b> 30, 100, 240, 33 and 50 kJ/mol, respectively. This indicates the proximity of boron to the metal-nonmetal borderline.|$|E

5|$|A 2014 study {{examined}} the effects of combined NVC and mindfulness training on 885 male inmates of the Monroe Correctional Complex in Monroe, Washington. The training was found to reduce recidivism from 37% to 21%, and the training was <b>estimated</b> <b>as</b> having saved the state $5 million per year in reduced incarceration costs. The training was found to increase equanimity, decrease anger, and lead to abilities to take responsibility for one's feelings, express empathy, and to make requests without imposing demands.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{industries}} and sources have been implicated, including {{high levels of}} dust in coal mining, gold mining, and the cotton textile industry, occupations involving cadmium and isocyanates, and fumes from welding. Working in agriculture is also a risk. In some professions the risks have been <b>estimated</b> <b>as</b> equivalent to that of one half to two packs of cigarettes a day. Silica dust and fiberglass dust exposure {{can also lead to}} COPD, with the risk unrelated to that for silicosis.

5|$|Common {{starlings}} can eat {{and damage}} fruit in orchards such as grapes, peaches, olives, currants and tomatoes or dig up newly sown grain and sprouting crops. They may also eat animal feed and distribute seeds through their droppings.
