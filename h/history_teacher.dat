5|$|McGovern {{attended}} Mitchell High School, {{where he}} was a solid but unspectacular member of the track team. A turning point came when his tenth-grade English teacher recommended him to the debate team, where he became quite active. His high-school debate coach, a <b>history</b> <b>teacher</b> who capitalized on McGovern's interest in that subject, proved to be a great influence in his life, and McGovern spent many hours honing his meticulous, if colorless, forensic style. McGovern and his debating partner won events in his area and gained renown in a state where debating was passionately followed by the general public. Debate changed McGovern's life, giving him a chance to explore ideas to their logical end, broadening his perspective, and instilling a sense of personal and social confidence. He graduated in 1940 in the top ten percent of his class.|$|E

They lived in London, where McKellen continued to pursue his career as an actor. For over a decade, he has lived in a five-storey Victorian conversion in Narrow Street, Limehouse. In 1978 he met his second partner, Sean Mathias, at the Edinburgh Festival. This relationship lasted until 1988, and acording to Mathias, was tempestuous, with conflicts over McKellen's success in acting versus Mathias's somewhat less-successful career. Mathias later directed McKellen in Waiting for Godot at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in 2009. The pair entered into a business partnership with Evgeny Lebedev, purchasing the lease on The Grapes public house in Narrow Street.|$|E

Koht had the choice between Ancient Greek and Classical Latin or Norwegian and German (including Norse); he chose the Norwegian and German. In 1895, after finishing his history studies, he spent three months in the Mediterranean, travelling with three ships, the first from Norway to Venice, the second from Venice to Constantinople, the third back to Norway. He studied German literature during this travels. In December 1896 Koht was finally examined by Sophus Bugge and earned his degree.

5|$|Rodham's {{mother wanted}} her to have an independent, {{professional}} career, and her father, who was otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter's abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender. Raised in a politically conservative household, Rodham helped canvass Chicago's South Side at age 13 following the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election, where she saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon. She then volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the U.S. presidential election of 1964. Rodham's early political development was shaped most by her high school <b>history</b> <b>teacher</b> (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago's Orchestra Hall.|$|E

However, both novice <b>history</b> <b>teachers</b> and experienced <b>history</b> <b>teachers</b> seem to struggle when they have to develop engaging learning tasks and teach historical reasoning competencies to students. This study chronicles the development of a pedagogy focusing on students’ ability to perform historical contextualization. Four intervention design principles were retrieved from previous research on historical contextualization and used to develop nine history lessons as an education intervention. This intervention was tested by 15 expert <b>history</b> <b>teachers</b> in an empirical quasi-experimental design with a pre-test and post-test. Results showed positive indicators for promoting students’ ability to perform historical contextualization.

40|$|The {{effective}} teaching of History {{is a prime}} area of concern for most History teacher-educators. This is because most <b>History</b> <b>teachers</b> do not adopt appropriate methods in teaching the subject. Owing to this, most students describe History as a boring and dull subject. The study investigated the perspectives of History student-teachers on {{effective teaching}} of History. A focus group discussion was held with five final-year prospective <b>History</b> <b>teachers.</b> The findings revealed that at the pre-engagement phase, student-teachers perceived effective teaching as comprising the acquisition of content knowledge, knowledge of learners, adequate planning, and collaboration with other teachers. At the engagement phase, effective <b>History</b> <b>teachers</b> demonstrate mastery over content, show enthusiasm, relate lessons to students ‟ prior knowledge, use multiple instructional methods and resources in conveying content, create a supportive learning environment, and use alternative assessment techniques. Also, at the post-engagement phase, {{it was found that}} effective <b>History</b> <b>teachers</b> are open to students ‟ concerns after class, seek feedback from students, and update their knowledge in content and pedagogy. It was thus concluded that History student-teachers possess an appreciable level of understanding of what constitutes effective teaching of History...|$|R
