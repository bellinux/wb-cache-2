5|$|For the sequel, Final Fantasy X-2, {{producer}} Kitase {{thought that}} the greatest fan expectation was for the reunion of Tidus and Yuna after their separation in the first game. The game generated rumors about Tidus' connection with the villain, Shuyin, who was physically similar and had the same actors. Square responded that such a storyline, given Tidus' nature, would be too complicated. For the remastering of Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2, producer Kitase's motivation was to <b>have</b> <b>people</b> {{too young to have}} played the games experience them; his son was only old enough to know the characters of Tidus and Yuna from Dissidia Final Fantasy and its prequel.|$|E
5|$|I heard {{dance and}} techno {{and was always}} {{interested}} in it but didn't really know where to go. But I went to a club one night and saw that people were losing their mind to these dance tracks. It wasn't really that I wanted to mimic that sound. I just wanted to have that energy and <b>have</b> <b>people</b> going crazy. So I knew the fusion was putting R with trance.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{consequences}} of the development of the entertainment industry has been the creation of new types of employment. While jobs such as writer, musician and composer exist as they always <b>have,</b> <b>people</b> doing this work are likely to be employed by a company rather than a patron as they once would have been. New jobs have appeared, such as gaffer or special effects supervisor in the film industry, and attendants in an amusement park.|$|E

5|$|The Nozomi Group in Shibuya is {{revealed}} to be using their Noah II machine to synthetically use gigalomaniac power for their own gain; to do this, they <b>have</b> <b>people</b> carrying transmitters to increase Noah II's signal reach. When a Noah II-created delusion causes people to panic, Sena and Kozue destroy nearby transmitters, and Takumi, Sena and Kozue join forces to stop Nozomi. They infiltrate Nozomi's headquarters and reach an underground research facility where they find Noah II and Genichi Norose, the president of Nozomi, who tries to stop them; they defeat him and destroy the machine, but it {{is revealed}} that the machine was just a prototype and not the actual Noah II, and that the Norose they fought was a real-booted delusion projected by the machine.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} a remaster {{originated}} from a reunion of the games' original development team and voice cast during the making of Final Fantasy Type-0. Character designer Tetsuya Nomura, associate producer Hideki Imaizumi and a voice actor thought that they should create something to celebrate the tenth anniversary of X. Producer Yoshinori Kitase's personal motivation was to <b>have</b> <b>people</b> {{too young to have}} played the games experience them, as his son was only old enough to know the characters of Tidus and Yuna from Dissidia Final Fantasy and its prequel. Another reason was that many did not have an opportunity to play the games since they were not compatible with the majority of PlayStation 3 models and neither available on the PlayStation Network unlike games from the original PlayStation like Final Fantasy VII and IX. Nomura entered negotiations with other old members of staff and got a remaster of X and X-2 approved, but the actual development process was delayed because much of the team was still busy with the creation of Final Fantasy XIII. The remaster was first announced at Tokyo Game Show 2011, where it was assumed that the game would release to commemorate Xs tenth anniversary.|$|E

25|$|It was {{especially}} {{during this time}} that African Americans began forming their own churches, {{in part because of}} the unequal treatment they were facing in integrated churches in both the North and the South.

25|$|John Wright, Indian National Coach (2000–2005) in {{his book}} John Wright's Indian Summers championed {{the need to have}} professionally paid {{selectors}} rather than <b>have</b> <b>people</b> play the role on an honorary basis.

25|$|Studies of the {{benefits}} of supplementation with calcium and vitamin D are conflicting, possibly because most studies did not <b>have</b> <b>people</b> with low dietary intakes. A 2013 review by the USPSTF found insufficient evidence to determine if supplementation with calcium and vitamin D results in greater harm or benefit in men and premenopausal women. The USPSTF did not recommend low dose supplementation (less than 1g of calcium and 400IU of vitamin D) in postmenopausal women as there {{does not appear to be}} a difference in fracture risk. It is unknown what effect higher doses have. A 2015 review found little data that supplementation of calcium decreases the risk of fractures.|$|E

25|$|While special {{reconnaissance}} always {{runs the}} danger of coming into combat situations, there may be situations, in an FID situation, where intelligence on some key adversary installation is essential, but the necessary ground observations can be made only by specialists. Perhaps the HN can carry out a conventional amphibious landing, but do not <b>have</b> <b>people</b> trained or equipped for beach mapping, evaluating defenses, etc., by night. In such cases, when less risky alternatives such as air or space reconnaissance have been exhausted, the FID nation might lead a team in such a mission. When the HN has qualified people, perhaps who have trained in the FID home country, but not the equipment, they can join in such an operation.|$|E

Ebiere continues with her protests while Dede forms a militant group, showing their displeasure through violence, vandalism and kidnapping Western Oil officials. Western Oil eventually convinces Ebiere (who is now Dede's love interest) to help ask Dede and his group for dialogue with government. It {{turns out to be a}} ploy to get them arrested. A shoot-out occurs, leading to Dede and his group being killed.|$|E
25|$|The {{day before}} Reese and Bianca's wedding, Kendall refuses {{to attend the}} ceremony. Zach tries to {{convince}} her to change her mind, saying that she is acting childish, but Kendall explains that he and Bianca betrayed her. Bianca receives word that Kendall will not be coming to her wedding and immediately rushes to Kendall's home to insist she attend. Kendall says that she will only come to the wedding as long as Bianca promises to leave for Paris soon afterward and take Reese and baby Gabrielle with her. Bianca reluctantly agrees. Later that night, Reese and Bianca have a wedding rehearsal. Kendall picks up a wine glass and makes a snarky toast to Reese and Bianca but particularly to Reese. Reese becomes upset; she grabs a bottle of wine, a glass, and walks off. Bianca follows her, but Reese wants to be alone. Zach later finds Reese and consoles her. He pulls her into a hug and then kisses her passionately; Reese kisses back. After a few moments, with Ryan having witnessed their kiss, unknown to them, they agree that the kiss never happened and that they already <b>have</b> <b>people</b> they are deeply in love with. Ryan later confronts Zach about the kiss, but Zach says it was nothing and nonchalantly walks away from Ryan.|$|E
