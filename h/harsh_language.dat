5|$|The English and Danish editions {{differed}} in several significant ways. The English edition was somewhat shorter and more concise, and included newer information that Heilmann had acquired {{by studying the}} actual fossils of Archaeopteryx in Berlin, {{as well as from}} foreign scientists who sent him photographs and plaster casts. It also contained considerably less <b>harsh</b> <b>language</b> towards Boas and others with whom he disagreed. Curiously, the English edition did not contain the transformational sequences inspired by D'Arcy Thompson, though Heilmann still briefly acknowledged the use of his methods in reconstructing his Proavis.|$|E

Wynn filed suit against Trump and Gomes for breach of contract, as Gomes was contracted {{to work at the}} Nugget until 1992. Gomes settled in 1994. Also in 1991, Gomes alleged in a countersuit that Wynn used <b>harsh</b> <b>language</b> against Gomes, but Wynn's representatives denied the allegations, implying that they were an attempt to refocus the lawsuit from Gomes to Wynn.|$|E

25|$|Within {{six months}} of their marriage, Gustavus Adolphus left to command the siege of Riga, leaving Maria Eleonora {{in the early stages}} of her first pregnancy. She lived {{exclusively}} in the company of her German ladies-in-waiting and had difficulty in adapting herself to the Swedish people, countryside and climate. She disliked the bad roads, sombre forests and wooded houses, roofed with turf. She also pined for her husband. A year after their wedding she had a miscarriage and became seriously ill. She was tempestuous, excessive, neurotic and jealous. She was often given to <b>harsh</b> <b>language,</b> and she did not spare her husband, even when strangers were present. Her emotional life lacked balance, and everything Maria Eleonora undertook on her own initiative needed careful watching. Soon Gustavus Adolphus' intimates knew that his married life was a source of grief and anxiety.|$|E

500|$|The {{findings}} of the commission generated mixed reactions among lawmakers, intelligence officers, and experts. [...] The intelligence community was privately angered by the <b>harsh</b> <b>language</b> the report used to describe their own assessments of the threat, although CIA Director George Tenet did not openly criticize it in public. [...] Congressional proponents of a national missile shield, especially Republicans, used the findings to further push their case that such a shield was necessary. However, some experts {{in and out of}} government questioned the usefulness of the report, saying that it made general speculations without reaching any definite conclusions. [...] Whereas the intelligence estimate focused on what was actually occurring, the commission focused on what might occur. [...] This was labeled in one article [...] "'hypothesis-based' threat assessment".|$|E

[...] "Thus, all of the justices summarily rejected anticipatory overruling, without considering its possible benefits," [...] Bradford wrote. But the majoritys Rodriguez de Quijas arguments themselves contradicted McMahons reading of Wilko. Where OConnor in the earlier case had held that Wilko rejected arbitration only as inadequate to protect an investors substantive rights, Kennedy read Wilko as inherently inapplicable to the substantive provisions.|$|R
5000|$|Callaway's {{script was}} {{published}} in an edited [...] "young adult" [...] format, leaving in all descriptions of violence but omitting the <b>harsher</b> <b>language.</b> Filming took place in Mexico and California. I Still Know What You Did Last Summer was released to negative reviews, but was a box office success, grossing $84 million worldwide. On August 22, 2006, Destination Films released I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer as a straight-to-video sequel to the film which features no returning cast members. The film was released on Blu-ray on July 14, 2009.|$|R
500|$|By contrast, the ESRB {{has only}} officially issued the AO rating for extreme {{violence}} three times: Thrill Kill, a fighting game with heavy sexual overtones, received an AO rating with content descriptors for [...] "Animated Violence" [...] and [...] "Animated Blood and Gore". Thrill Kill was cancelled by Electronic Arts after it acquired the game's publisher, Virgin Interactive, due to objections over the game's content. Manhunt 2 also received an AO rating for its extreme violence; while the uncut version {{would be released}} exclusively for PCs, the console versions were edited to meet the M rating criteria. In January 2015, Hatred, a controversial game whose plot centers around a character indiscriminately murdering everyone he encounters, received the rating for its extreme violence and harsh language; one of the game's developers disputed the rating, arguing that [...] "its violence isn't really that bad and this <b>harsh</b> <b>language</b> isn't overused", but also acknowledged the rarity of their situation.|$|E
500|$|The player's {{health is}} {{represented}} by a red [...] "Crimson Omen" [...] that fades onto the screen the more damage the player takes; staying {{out of the line}} of fire allows the player to recover their health. Depending on the game mode or difficulty, if the player takes too much damage, they enter a downed state where they can crawl around the map to get out of battle and seek help. During this time, a teammate can revive him, an enemy may brutally execute the downed player, or the player may bleed out if too much time has passed. The player can also grab a downed character and use them as a meatshield, allowing the body to absorb damage but forcing the player to use a one-handed pistol. Explosive weapons will simply destroy the character they strike. Like its predecessor, Gears of War 2 features an optional mature content filter, which, when active, makes blood appear as sparks and removes <b>harsh</b> <b>language</b> from the dialogue. Furthermore, progress towards most of the Xbox achievements for the game can be earned in either campaign or multiplayer modes.|$|E

[...] One of the most rancorous debates {{in the history of}} ornithology had begun in earnest. [...] The two sides each published additional responses that seemed, to many ornithological observers, to have departed markedly from accepted scientific decorum. Jackson accused the Fitzpatrick team of [...] "untruths", and Fitzpatrick accused Jackson of obviating the normal peer-review system with an opinion piece [...] "treated as a scientific contribution by the public media." ...|$|E

5000|$|In the {{follow-up}} mini-series, The Return (written by Gilmore {{and illustrated by}} Benes, Pimental and Lea), published in 2003, Lion-O returned to Thundera to find it enslaved to Mumm-Ra. Several of the ThunderCats are scattered. Panthro, who was left in charge while Lion-O was away, was forced into slave labor. Tygra and Cheetara are held prisoner in Castle Plundarr while Wilykit and Wilykat are the personal servants of Mumm-Ra. This storyline was distinctly more mature than many episodes of the series, with much <b>harsher</b> <b>language</b> such as [...] "bastard" [...] used by Mumm-Ra. Cheetara is depicted as holding a grudge against Lion-O for [...] "abandoning" [...] his friends and leaving her to be abused by the Mutants and WilyKat's corruption in the earlier mini-series takes greater form. Realizing he has betrayed his friends, the older cub flees when the mini-series concludes. Lion-O and the ThunderCats emerge triumphant over Mumm-Ra once again.|$|R
5000|$|Von Matačić {{was also}} active as a composer. His most {{significant}} composition is his Symphony of Confrontations („Symphonie der Konfrontationen“, 1979, revised 1984), an hour-long work in four movements for two pianos, large string orchestra and enormous percussion sections. It {{deals with the}} threat of destruction by nuclear weapons in a <b>harsh</b> musical <b>language</b> that includes quotes from the [...] "Dies Irae" [...] Theme from Hector Berlioz' Symphonie Fantastique.|$|R
2500|$|Language {{itself is}} a major theme in the play, {{especially}} in the taming process, where mastery of language becomes paramount. Katherina is initially described as a shrew because of her <b>harsh</b> <b>language</b> to those around her; [...] "from {{the outset of the}} play, Katherine's threat to male authority is posed through language: it is perceived by others as such and is linked to a claim larger than shrewishness – witchcraft – through the constant allusions to Katherine's kinship with the devil." [...] For example, after Katherina rebukes Hortensio and Gremio in Act 1, Scene 1, Hortensio replies with [...] "From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!" [...] (l.66). Even Katherina's own father refers to her as [...] "thou hilding of a devilish spirit" [...] (2.1.26). Petruchio, however, attempts to tame her – and thus her language – with rhetoric that specifically undermines her tempestuous nature; ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{opposition}} to Oslo, {{an alliance of}} conservative groups, such as the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), Americans For a Safe Israel (AFSI), and the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA) tried to counterbalance {{the power of the}} liberal Jews. On October 10, 1993, the opponents of the Palestinian-Israeli accord organized at the American Leadership Conference for a Safe Israel, where they warned that Israel was prostrating itself before [...] "an armed thug", and predicted and that the [...] "thirteenth of September is a date that will live in infamy". Some Zionists also criticized, often in <b>harsh</b> <b>language,</b> Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, his foreign minister and chief architect of the peace accord. With the community so strongly divided, AIPAC and the Presidents Conference, which was tasked with representing the national Jewish consensus, struggled to keep the increasingly antagonistic discourse civil. Reflecting these tensions, Abraham Foxman from the Anti-Defamation League was asked by the conference to apologize for bad mouthing ZOA's Morton Klein. The conference, which under its organizational guidelines was in charge of moderating communal discourse, reluctantly censured some Orthodox spokespeople for attacking Colette Avital, the Labor-appointed Israeli Consul General in New York and an ardent supporter of that version of a peace process.|$|E
2500|$|During {{her second}} term, {{relations}} with Indian Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao further deteriorated. Like her father, Benazir Bhutto used rhetoric to oppose to India and {{campaign in the}} international community against the Indian nuclear programme. On 1 May 1995 she used <b>harsh</b> <b>language</b> in her public warning to India that [...] "continuation of [...] nuclear programme would have terrible consequences". India responded to this saying she was interfering in an [...] "internal matter" [...] of India, and the Indian Army fired a RPG at the Kahuta, which further escalated events, leading to full-fledged war. When this news reached Bhutto, she responded by high-alerting the Air Force Strategic Command. It ordered heavily armed Arrows, Griffins, Black Panthers and the Black Spiders to begin air sorties and to patrol the Indo-Pakistan border on day-and-night regular missions. All of these squadrons are part of the Strategic Command. On 30 May, India test-fired a Prithvi-1 missile near the Pakistan border, which Bhutto condemned. She responded by deploying Shaheen-I missiles; however, they were not armed. Benazir Bhutto permitted the PAF to deploy the Crotale missile defence and the Anza-Mk-III near the Indian border, which escalated the conflict, but effectively kept the Indian Army and the Indian Air Force from launching any surprise attack.|$|E
50|$|The {{release of}} his tenth novel When Heaven Falls Down, a romantic novel which has enough {{contents}} based on communal conflagration, rape by religious leaders, love-jihad, reality of Indian health care system, Medical negligence, Prostitution and corruption in Indian education system caused immediate controversy {{as it was}} seen as an irreverent depiction of Maulvi. It was alleged that content of this book is full of <b>harsh</b> <b>languages</b> against Muslim showing the naked reality of India where Hindus and Muslims still keep arguing and fighting against each other to prove whose religion is better. A part of the story where a girl is raped by four Maulvies invited sharp criticism. A Maulvi and a Muslim group in Gaya have protested against the author and have asked the book to be banned. He responded by saying he didn't intend to hurt Maulvis and he didn't want to project any generalization towards the whole religion through it. The only motto behind writing this book was to promote communal harmony in society by diminishing social hatred. Later on his native house was attacked and abusive posters were affixed. A police complain was registered in local police station against unknown perpetrators.|$|R

Yet, my Lords, when that peer did but just modestly hint that he had received hard measure from the Commons and their Managers, those Managers thought themselves bound seriatim, one after another, to express the utmost indignation at the charge, in the <b>harshest</b> <b>language</b> that could be used. Why did they do so? They knew it was the language that became them. They lived in an age in which politeness was as well understood and as much cultivated as it is at present; but {{they knew what they were}} doing, and they were resolved to use no language but what their ancestors had used, and to suffer no insolence which their ancestors would not have suffered.
