500|$|Both Grand Forks and East Grand Forks had {{to decide}} whether to develop the land along the river. The {{president}} of the East Grand Forks planning-and-zoning commission commented on the idea of development, [...] "The river had been our friend <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>years.</b> It had been like an old dog, sleeping comfortably at our feet, and then one day it jumped up and bit us. We {{had to decide}}: Do we put it to sleep or try to make amends?" [...] What were once entire neighborhoods are now covered by grass and trees, part of an extensive area of parkland called the Greater Grand Forks Greenway. In East Grand Forks, this transformation is especially visible. One former neighborhood is now a large campground, the center of what is now known as the Red River State Recreation Area. The cities of today are significantly different from their pre-flood state, but many residents are pleased with this, seeing it as fulfillment of President Bill Clinton's promise that the cities would [...] "rebuild stronger and better than ever." [...] Population estimates by the Census Bureau and by the city of Grand Forks itself now show a growing community.|$|E
500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalised}} rating out of 100to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, Life Is People received an average score of 86, based on 21reviews, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". In his review for AllMusic, Thom Jurek stated that [...] "Fay performs these songs {{as if they}} were living things, independent of his inner world. His reverence for them makes the listening experience one of great emotional depth. Life Is People brims with compassion, vulnerability, and tenderness. It is not a comeback record but a late continuation, a great work of art." [...] Drew Litowitz of Consequence of Sound wrote that [...] "little has changed. Fay's songs sound as if they've simply been hanging out in the ether <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>years,</b> just waiting to be put to tape...Life Is People makes a strong argument for why Fay deserves recognition, and not just by those in the know." [...] The Daily Telegraphs Neil McCormick called the album a [...] "belated triumph" [...] which [...] "unfolds with the assurance of an old master still burning with the desire to tell his tales", saying that it was [...] "so much stronger than the latter-day works of many of Fay's contemporaries." [...] Critic Tom Hughes of The Guardian was less complimentary, noting that the album was [...] "not without a few syrupy moments, {{and it would be a}} push to recommend it over the old records" [...] but concluded that [...] "there are some fine songs here." [...] Andy Gill, writing for The Independent, said that [...] "Fay has finally created the masterpiece that will secure his reputation" [...] and added that Life is People was [...] "truly, the album of a lifetime." ...|$|E

2500|$|It was {{reported}} on January 23 the sale agreement had been completed. Early reports indicated Hicks would remain a minority owner {{with the club}} and would serve on the board in a non-voting honorary position. Approval from the executive and ownership committee, the banks who were owed money by HSG, and 75% of MLB owners was still required before the sale could have been finalized. The new company would be called Rangers Baseball Express. Greenberg would serve as CEO and managing partner, and Ray Davis and Bob Simpson would be co-chairmen of the board. As {{a part of the}} original purchase agreement, Rangers Baseball Express also would acquire approximately [...] of land adjacent to Rangers Ballpark in Arlington and Cowboys Stadium. A separate company owned by Hicks owns the land. After the land sale was announced, Hicks was sued by a former partner over the land. The former partner claims Hicks never dissolved the partnership that was formed when the two groups were planning the development called Glorypark. Hicks was also sued by an architectural firm, RTKL, and a construction company, Vratsinas, for $6.9 million of unpaid work done over three years ago. Greenberg posted the following on his Facebook page after the original purchase agreement was announced:Tonight was a big night for Nolan Ryan and me as we signed the definitive agreement to purchase the Texas Rangers. Thank you to everyone for your incredible support and encouragement over the last few months. Nolan and I can't wait to get started in our efforts to bring Rangers fans everywhere what you have waited <b>for</b> ...<b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>years.</b> Thanks again and....
