40|$|Acidic and <b>enzymatic</b> <b>coagulation</b> of milk {{are complex}} {{processes}} which proceed in several phases and are dependent upon many different parameters. The formation of coagulum during lactic-acid fermentation {{is in fact}} acidic coagulation of milk. It occurs because {{of an increase in}} concentration of lactic acid, which causes a decrease in pH. <b>Enzymatic</b> <b>coagulation</b> of milk has been analytically described by means of mathematical models by many authors. Although enzymatic and acidic coagulation of milk do not proceed according to identical physical and chemical rules, it is possible to compare them kinetically. The aim of this paper was to combine the kinetics of enzymatic and acidic coagulation of milk and to mathematically present the changes that develop during lactic-acid fermentation of milk. The models presented in this paper enable a more complex mathematical analysis of the coagulation of the protein content of milk during lactic-acid fermentation. Application of the models enables the analysis and comparison of the kinetics of coagulation in different types of milk and various types of fermented dairy products manufactured with lactic acid bacteria. Mathematical combination of coagulation kinetics of the protein complex in milk with reological characteristics of the obtained fermented dairy products enables easier defining of parameters for lactic acid fermentation...|$|E
40|$|Sequence {{analysis}} of a Triatoma dimidiata salivary gland cDNA library resulted {{in the identification of}} two transcripts (Td 60 and Td 101) homologous to triabin, an inhibitor of thrombin in Triatoma pallidipennis saliva. In the present study, a recombinant protein of Td 60, designated dimiconin, was expressed in Escherichia coli and its activity was characterized. The resulting protein inhibited the intrinsic but not extrinsic blood coagulation pathway, suggesting that dimiconin is not a thrombin inhibitor. Measurement of the <b>enzymatic</b> activity of <b>coagulation</b> factors using chromogenic substrates revealed that dimiconin efficiently inhibited factor XIIa (FXIIa) activity in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, pre-incubation of dimiconin with FXII effectively inhibited FXIIa activity whereas dimiconin did not affect already activated FXIIa, indicating that dimiconin inhibits the activation of FXII but not the enzymatic activity of FXIIa. These results show that dimiconin is an inhibitor of the contact phase initiated by FXII activation in the blood coagulation cascade, which differs from the bioactivity of triabin.

40|$|Objectives: The known {{model of}} blood {{coagulation}} involves {{a series of}} zymogen activation reaction sequences. At each stage, a zymogen is converted to an active protease by cleavage {{of one or more}} peptide bonds in the precursor molecule. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate amino acid profiles during coagulation process in different conditions in vitro. Methods: Samples of serum and plasma (treated by EDTA or citrate) were obtained from healthy donors and from patients with Phenylketonuria (PKU). Amino acid profiles analyzed with reverse phase HPLC column. Results: There were no differences between two plasma amino acid levels which were obtained by EDTA and acid citrate (p> 0. 05). Serum aspartate (asp), glutamate (glu), serine (ser), histidine (his) and phenylalanine (phe) levels were significantly higher in serum than plasma (p< 0. 05). This significant difference was not observed in patients with PKU. Conclusion: As a result the <b>enzymatic</b> reactions of <b>coagulation</b> process generate some aminoacids and these reactions take place in an appropriate chemical microenvironment.

40|$|Sequence {{analysis}} of the Lutzomyia (Lu.) ayacuchensis salivary gland cDNA library identified a short peptide containing an RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) sequence flanked by two cysteine residues in the C-terminal end as the most abundant transcript. In the present study, a recombinant protein of the RGD-containing peptide, designated ayadualin, was expressed in Escherichia coli and its activity was characterized. Ayadualin inhibited both collagen and ADP-induced platelet aggregations by interfering with the binding of integrin ?IIb? 3 to fibrinogen. The RGD sequence and cysteine residues located {{on both sides of}} the RGD sequence were essential for the inhibitory action. Moreover, ayadualin efficiently inhibited the intrinsic blood coagulation pathway irrespective of the RGD sequence. Measuring the <b>enzymatic</b> activity of <b>coagulation</b> factors using chromogenic substrates revealed that ayadualin efficiently inhibited factor XIIa (FXIIa) activity in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, pre-incubation of ayadualin with FXII inhibited FXIIa activity, while activated FXIIa was not affected by ayadualin, indicating that ayadualin inhibits the activation of FXII, but not enzymatic activity of FXIIa. These results indicated that ayadualin plays an important role in the blood feeding of Lu. ayacuchensis by inhibiting host hemostasis via dual mechanism...|$|R

Therefore, based on the turbidimetric and conductivimetric methods, a follow up of <b>enzymatic</b> <b>coagulation</b> is realized. Drainage of renneted gels was followed by syneresis study and cheese yield. The comparison between the coagulation aptitude of low fat milk and milk-olive oil emulsion showed that the hydrolysis phase extended up to 35 minutes for full fat milk and up to 38 minutes for milk-olive oil emulsion. The transition phase solid/gel was shorter {{in the case of the}} whole milk. The reticulation phase was shorter in the case of milk-olive oil emulsion. The milk conductivity depended on the milk richness in fat content. Milk-olive oil emulsion showed the lowest cheese-making yield compared to its full and low-fat counterpart...|$|E
40|$|Whey is {{the liquid}} from the {{coagulation}} of milk for cheese making. It is obtained after separation of casein and fat (Caballero and Acosta, 2008). There {{are two types of}} whey, the first process is called acid fermentation (microbial coagulation) or addition of organic acids, the second called sweet obtained by <b>enzymatic</b> <b>coagulation</b> mediated by renin, an enzyme obtained from sheep and goat rennet infants (Jelen 2003; Bracho, 2013). Approximately 90 % of the milk used in the cheese industry is eliminated as whey (Padin and Diaz, 2009), which is discarded in soil and natural water courses (Hernandez, 2005), constituting an environmental pollution. The overall objective was to propose the use of whey in the manufacture of handmade paintings and to contribute to economic and social development of the circuit or food chain, for the collective benefit in rural areas. Physicochemical and microbiological properties of whey acid (LA) and sweet (LS) were determined following the Norma venezolana COVENIN.

40|$|The {{study was}} carried out on 86 ‘Cilentana’ goats, {{distributed}} in four herds. Milk samples were collected during morning and evening milking, and pH, dry matter, fat, protein and lactose percentage {{as well as the}} lactodynamometric profile were detected to determine <b>enzymatic</b> phase duration, <b>coagulation</b> speed and curd consistency. Polymorphism of the s 1 -casein protein was detected. Four alleles (designated A, B, E and F) and nine genotypes were detected. The association of these nine genotypes with chemical composition and lactodynamometric characteristics was investigated. The BF genotype was the most frequent (35. 5 %), followed by EE (15. 1 %) and AF and BB (10. 4 %). The F allele showed the highest frequency and it negatively influenced cheesemaking as it was associated with a low s 1 -casein content. Goats with the AB genotype produced milk with higher dry matter, protein and fat content compared with the FF genotype. Moreover, milk from the AB genotype has a lower enzymatic phase duration and a higher coagulation speed than the BB genotype. Curd consistency is higher for milk from the AA genotype, when compared with the EF genotype.

The analysis were performed on 326 milk samples collected from 60 half sib buffaloes, ascertained by DNA test, every 50 days. The percentages of dry matter, proteins and fat of the curd were inversely correlated to the curd firmness (a 30), a low <b>enzymatic</b> phase of <b>coagulation</b> and low pH value. Percentage of dry matter in the curd was positively correlated with proteins, casein and fat of the milk and negatively with lactose. Furthermore, dry matter and proteins percentages are also positively correlated with theoretical cheese yield and its ratio with real cheese yield, curd dry matter from 1 litre of milk and the ratio between curd dry matter and protein percentage. Negative correlations were found with real cheese yield at 28 hours (r = - 0. 100; P< 0. 01) and its ratio with protein percentage. An inverse relationship was highlighted between curd proteins percentage and fat of either milk and curd, while a direct association was present with lactose. A higher protein percentage in the curd was linked to a lower cheese yield and a lower ratio between cheese yield and proteins. Ash of the curd, finally, showed similar association to those described for proteins...|$|R
40|$|Chronic neck pain is a {{major problem}} with common causes {{including}} disc herniation and spondylosis that compress the spinal nerve roots. Cervical nerve root compression in the rat produces sustained behavioral hypersensitivity, {{due in part to the}} early upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the sustained hyperexcitability of neurons in the spinal cord and degeneration in the injured nerve root. Through its activation of the protease-activated receptor- 1 (PAR 1), mammalian thrombin can enhance pain and inflammation; yet at lower concentrations it is also capable of transiently attenuating pain which suggests that PAR 1 activation rate may affect pain maintenance. Interestingly, salmon-derived fibrin, which contains salmon thrombin, attenuates nerve root-induced pain and inflammation, but the mechanisms of action leading to its analgesia are unknown. This study evaluates the effects of salmon thrombin on nerve root-mediated pain, axonal degeneration in the root, spinal neuronal hyperexcitability and inflammation compared to its human counterpart in the context of their <b>enzymatic</b> capabilities towards <b>coagulation</b> substrates and PAR 1. Salmon thrombin significantly reduces behavioral sensitivity, preserves neuronal myelination, reduces macrophage infiltration in the injured nerve root and significantly decreases spinal neuronal hyperexcitability after painful root compression in the rat; whereas human thrombin has no effect. Unlike salmon thrombin, human thrombin upregulates the transcription of IL- 1 b and TNF-a and the secretion of IL- 6 by cortical cultures.

This acidification would cause a decrease in pH, an increase in demineralization of the curd, and consequently a final product with desired textural and taste properties. To achieve this acidification, three different methods were tested: addition of a chemical acidifying agent (gluco-δ-lactone); addition of a direct vat set starter culture before coagulation, and incorporation of a pre-multiplied starter culture, at the same stage. Evaluations showed that the most appropriate methodology was the incorporation of a pre-multiplied starter culture, to promote the lowering of pH values below 5. 5, during manufacture, and not during the retention period.

Positive correlations were found between FCY and 28 CY and the <b>enzymatic</b> phase of <b>coagulation</b> and with the milk content in DM, proteins, casein and lipids. Negative correlations were found with lactose and urea milk content. These yields increased when the percentage of DM, proteins and hash of the curd were lower and that of lipids was higher. The 28 CY is correlated with ThCY (r = 0. 762; P < 0. 01) and with the CDM (r = 0. 809; P < 0. 01). A high 28 CY was also characterized by a high 28 CY/% proteins ratio and CDM/% proteins ratio. The CDM was higher when the DM of milk and its content in proteins, casein and lipids were higher and when the content in lactose was lower. A correlation (r = 0. 501; P < 0. 01) was observed between the CDM and the DM percentage of the curd. For the other components the correlations found {{were the same as}} for the 28 CY.

NutschThis paper {{reviews the}} safe {{production}} of hard and semi-soft natural cheeses made from pasteurized milk, starter cultures, and <b>enzymatic</b> <b>coagulation.</b> Historically, raw milk {{has been a}} source of pathogenic bacteria; however, High Temperature Short Time (HTST) pasteurization has been proven to effectively control these pathogens. The US Public Health Service (USPHS) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) promulgate the legal operational parameters in the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance (PMO) and Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) to ensure milk is properly pasteurized and that dairy products are made in accordance with these regulatory standards. A combination of factors in the production of these natural cheeses further inhibits microorganisms. Intrinsic factors include pH, oxidation-reduction potential, water activity, nutrient content, natural inhibitors, and physical integrity. Extrinsic factors include temperature, relative humidity, gaseous environment, cumulative stress, and storage time. These factors contribute to a multiple hurdle effect that inhibits pathogens and spoilage organisms while also providing operational parameters to ensure flavor, texture, and other quality targets. Hard and semi-soft natural cheeses have been associated with few cases of food borne illness over the last few decades. Nevertheless, many operations in the dairy industry have voluntarily implemented food safety systems such as HACCP to ensure the continuous safe production of hard and semi-soft natural cheese...|$|E
40|$|Cheese {{making is}} {{a process in which}} <b>enzymatic</b> <b>coagulation</b> of milk is {{followed}} by protein separation, carbohydrate removal, and an extended bacterial fermentation. The number of variables in this complex process that influence cheese quality is so large that the developments of new manufacturing protocols are cumbersome. To reduce screening costs, several models have been developed to miniaturize the cheese manufacturing process. However, these models are not able to accommodate the throughputs required for systematic screening programs. Here, we describe a protocol that allows the parallel manufacturing of approximately 600 cheeses in individual cheese vats each with individual process specifications. Protocols for the production of miniaturized Gouda- and Cheddar-type cheeses have been developed. Starting with as little as 1. 7 mL of milk, miniature cheeses of about 170 mg can be produced and they closely resemble conventionally produced cheese in terms of acidification profiles, moisture and salt contents, proteolysis, flavor profiles, and microstructure. Flavor profiling of miniature cheeses manufactured with and without mixed-strain adjunct starter cultures allowed the distinguishing of the different cheeses. Moreover, single-strain adjunct starter cultures engineered to overexpress important flavor-related enzymes revealed effects similar to those described in industrial cheese. Benchmarking against industrial cheese produced from the same raw materials established a good correlation between their proteolytic degradation products and their flavor profiles. These miniature cheeses, referred to as microcheeses, open new possibilities to study many aspects of cheese production, which will not only accelerate product development but also allow a more systematic approach to investigate the complex biochemistry and microbiology of cheese makin...|$|E

The influences of pH, calcium concentration, temperature of coagulation of milk and applied heat treatment on the syneresis induced by different intensity of centrifugal force have been investigated. Coagulated samples were centrifuged at 1000, 2000 and 3000 rpm for 5 min, respectively. Reconstituted skim milk powder (control sample) and reconstituted non-fat milk heat treated at 87 ºC/ 10 min (experimental sample) are coagulated at temperatures of 30 ºC and 35 ºC, at pH value of 5. 8 and 6. 2, and with the addition of 100, 200 and 400 mg/l of CaCl 2, respectively. Centrifugation at 1000 rpm of both control and experimental samples didn’t recover any sera, regardless of the applied coagulation conditions. This indicates that the intensity of centrifugal force wasn’t strong enough to disrupt gel structure and cause syneresis. When the intensity of centrifugal force was increased up to 2000 rpm, the syneresis was induced, but the degree of syneresis depended on the applied factors of coagulation, primary on the applied heat treatments and temperature of coagulation. The amount of added CaCl 2 didn’t have a significant influence on the induced syneresis at 2000 rpm. The induced syneresis was very significant for both control and experimental samples when the intensity of centrifugal force of 3000 rpm was applied.

40|$|AbstractMilk {{coagulation}} is {{the primary}} step {{in the development of}} most dairy products. Raw milk from individual cows and different breeds exhibit distinct coagulation capacities. This variation is largely influenced by milk protein genetic variants. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate differences in coagulation properties between milk obtained from three cattle breeds/types found in Sri Lanka. A total of 90 milk samples (400 mL from each individual) were collected from two Sri Lankan cattle breeds/types (Thamankaduwa White/TW and Local/“Batu” cattle) and one European cattle breed (Friesian). Collected samples were subjected to <b>enzymatic</b> <b>coagulation</b> using commercial rennet source (Chymax®, Christian Hansen Standard, Denmark) and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) coagulation using a commercial starter culture(YFL 8 12,Christian Hansen Standard, Denmark) to determine milk coagulation properties. Different properties of milk coagulum such as yield, curd firmness, syneresis and rheological properties were evaluated. The biochemical composition (lactose, protein, fat, solid-non-fat) of milk samples were determined. Capillary Zone Electrophoresis (CZE) method was used to determine milk protein genetic variants. Experimental design was Nested Completely Randomized Design with three treatments. Milk coagulation time and curd firmness after enzymatic-coagulation were not significantly different (p> 0. 05) among the breeds. Coagulum yield was significantly higher (p< 0. 05) for the TW type than that of other breeds. Coagulum yield was negatively correlated with β-caseinA 1 and α-lactalbumin in both enzymatic (- 0. 58) and LAB coagulation (- 0. 69). Coagulum yield was positively correlated (p< 0. 05) with β-casein B variant (0. 70), protein (0. 34) and lactose (0. 36) contents. Meltability value was weakly and positively (p< 0. 05) correlated (0. 34) with fat content of milk.

40|$|Summary Factor (F) VIII is an {{essential}} cofactor in the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>coagulation</b> cascade. A defect in the gene encoding for FVIII results in the X-linked inherited bleeding disorder hemophilia A. In the circulation, FVIII is protected from proteolytic degradation and premature clearance by forming a complex with its carrier protein von Willebrand factor (VWF). While the complex of FVIII and VWF involves {{one of the strongest}} protein-protein interactions in the human body, it has remained unclear when and where FVIII and VWF first interact. The most widely accepted view is that FVIII and VWF are secreted from different cells and form a complex in the circulation, merely by virtue of their high-affinity interaction. During the last decade however, increasing evidence has been presented that suggests that the human body should also comprise a releasable storage pool of both proteins. In this thesis, we have studied the relationship between high-affinity interaction in the circulation and intracellular co-storage of FVIII and VWF. We have taken a new approach towards this issue by creating fluorescently tagged VWF and FVIII proteins that are established as being deficient in high-affinity interaction. We have demonstrated that FVIII is stored in VWF-containing storage organelles in absence of high-affinity interaction and that the extent of FVIII storage is independent of its affinity for VWF. In addition, we studied the therapeutic benefit of intracellular co-expression of FVIII and VWF in terms of potential treatment options for hemophilia A. We have shown that blood outgrowth endothelial cells can produce high levels of functional FVIII over a prolonged period of time. In addition, we have demonstrated that a substantial amount of FVIII can be stored in VWF-containing storage organelles whereas the majority of FVIII is released in a constitutive manner. From our data, we conclude that the structural requirements that determine high-affinity interaction between FVIII and VWF in the circulation differ from those that determine intracellular co-trafficking. Our data provide a molecular explanation for the fact that hemophilia A and von Willebrand’s disease patients that suffer from impaired complex assembly of FVIII and VWF in the circulation show concomitant increase of FVIII and VWF plasma levels following treatment with desmopressin. The mechanism that determines FVIII storage in VWF-containing granules as well as the therapeutic potential of FVIII expression in VWF producing cells now awaits further exploration...|$|E
