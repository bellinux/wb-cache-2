A lawyer does not sin in seeking to be a judge, or in compassing his wishes by all honest means. A young diplomat entertains a fair ambition when he looks forward to be the lord of a first-rate embassy; and a poor novelist, when he attempts to rival Dickens or rise above Fitzjeames, commits no fault, though he may be foolish. Sydney Smith truly said that in these recreant days we cannot expect to find the majesty of St. Paul beneath the cassock of a curate. If we look to our clergymen {{to be more than}} men, we shall probably teach ourselves to think that they are less, and can hardly hope to raise the character of the pastor by denying to him the right to entertain the aspirations of a man.|$|E

40|$|The {{paper by}} Philip Lane {{looks at the}} role of {{external}} funding in the funding of infrastructure. He starts with a review of literature which is, in large part, a review of Philip’s own work. This is appropriate given that the body of work he has put together, particularly with Gian Maria Milesi‑Ferretti, is the standard-setter {{when looking at the}} issue of cross-border financial stocks and flows. The difference between Lane’s paper and the previous paper in this session by Marcel Fratzscher is primarily one of frequency. Fratzscher’s paper examines weekly data while Lane’s paper utilises decadal data. Lane uses this analysis of the data on external positions to examine the role of foreign capital flows in funding infrastructure. He notes that accessing this larger pool of capital available offshore for infrastructure reduces the likelihood of crowding out that could occur if only domestic funding were sought. I am not sure <b>I</b> would <b>completely</b> <b>agree</b> with this argument. Capital is essentially fungible, so there is no particular reason (on this grounds) why offshore funding is more desirable for funding infrastructure rather than any other part of the economy where desired investment or spending exceeds savings. For example, infrastructure could be entirely domestically funded, but other areas of corporate activity could be funded from abroad...|$|R

40|$|Kass states (page 5) that Figure 3 {{is not a}} good general {{description}} of statistical inference and that Figure 1 is more accurate. <b>I</b> <b>completely</b> <b>agree.</b> Kass states (page 5) that “It is important for students in introductorycoursestoseethesubjectasacoherent, principled, whole. ” <b>I</b> <b>completely</b> <b>agree.</b> Since Figure 3 represents the framework within which statistics is usually taught, at all levels, we have a serious problem. These issues have bothered me deeply for a long time. This important paper forcibly brings these matters to light and I hope it is influential. Figure 3 represents “sampling from a finite population. ” There are a large number of unknown numbersandwerandomlypick someof them touncover. The “population quantities ” are summaries of all of the numbers. These are the parameters. Sample quantities are summaries of the uncovered numbers.

40|$|Opinions {{are divided}} in {{relation}} to what generical name has priority, Heliacus or Torinia. In proof of this I will quote, leaving aside those of many others, the opinions of two authorities. Thiele [1918, p. 80 (114) ] writes: "Bezüglich des Namens Torinia bemerkt Iredale, dass ihm Heliacus Orbigny, weil älter, vorzuziehen sei; es mag sein, dass dieser Name ein wenig älter ist — nach Hermannsen von 1841, nach Iredale 1842, es scheint also die Zeit des Erscheinens nicht ganz festzustehen —, während Torinia von Gray 1842 auf die Beschaffenheit des Deckels hin begründet worden ist". The opinion of Tomlin (1928, p. 333), however, is quite different: "Gray in Proc. Zool. Soc., 1847, Ρ· 151, gives his own genus Torinia precedence, quoting it as of 1840 and 1842. These two references are to different editions of the 'Synopsis of the Contents of the British Museum', and are fully explained by Iredale in Proc. Malac. Soc. (London), X, pp. 294 - 309. The 1840 usage of Torinia is a nomen nudum; the 1842 edition gives a short comparative account of operculum only, quoted on p. 308. It hardly seems a sufficient diagnosis on which to found a genus, {{and the reasons for}} rejection given by Iredale on p. 301 may well be applied to this case at any rate". As I mentioned already in a previous paper (1940, p. 223), I follow in this catalogue Thiele's "Handbuch der systematischen Weichtierkunde", {{in relation to}} the generic names and also as far as concerns the classification, but it is not my intention to state thereby hat <b>I</b> always <b>completely</b> <b>agree</b> with the opinions of his author.

And the view connects well with findings reported in psycholinguistic literature. Of course, there are several very broad areas that are sufficiently specific to allow for hypothesis of a specialized competence and about which people have intuitions. One is human general understanding of number(s) that is quite specialized, and can be lost, {{as a consequence of}} brain damage, without impairment in other areas. The next is our spatial competence, presumably producing our spatial-geometrical intuitions.

40|$|Paul Los's central {{claim is}} {{distinctly}} insightful: In evaluating arguments, both for premise and connection adequacy, {{we need to}} take into account the types of statement constituting the argument.

Does the argument seek to establish an is-claim or an ought-claim? <b>I</b> <b>completely</b> <b>agree</b> and endorse his proposal (Step 2 of his argument evaluation procedure) that in evaluating premises, determining what type of statement is involved is required. Indeed, I believe this should be the first step in premise evaluation. In these comments, then, I want to indicate ways in which I believe Los's project should be developed. First, rhetoricians have long maintained that distinguishing types of statements for purposes of argument construction is necessary and proper. This goes back to classical rhetoric. As Kruger (1975) points out, early Latin rhetoricians in effect distinguished questions of description, interpretation, and evaluation. How we construct an argument will be influenced by whether the claim we are trying to establish concerns whether something happened (Did the American plane enter Chinese air space?), what sort of thing happened (Was this incursion deliberate provocation or an accident due either to human or mechanical error?), or whether what happened is the kind of thing which can be justified (If the incursion was a provocation, did the United State...|$|E
