The risk of catching malaria in Bangui and pygmy camps is also much higher than in the rest of the country.|$|E
5|$|Adud al-Dawla, {{like the}} {{previous}} Buyid rulers, maintained the Abbasids in Baghdad, which gave legitimacy to his dynasty {{in the eyes}} of some Sunni Muslims. However, he showed more interest than his predecessors to the pre-Islamic culture of Iran, and was proud of his Iranian origin. He visited Persepolis alongside Marasfand, the Zoroastrian chief priest (mobad) of Kazerun, who read the pre-Islamic inscriptions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>for</b> him. Adud al-Dawla later left an inscription in the city, which tells about his awareness of being heir of an ancient pre-Islamic civilization. Adud al-Dawla even claimed descent from the Sasanian king Bahram V Gor, minted coins of him wearing a Sasanian type crown, and carried the traditional Sasanian inscription; Shahanshah, may his glory increase. While the reverse side of the coin said: May Shah Fanna Khusraw live long.|$|E
5|$|In 1447 {{the local}} painter's guild elected Lochner as their {{representative}} municipal councilor, or Ratsherr. The appointment implies {{that he had}} lived in Cologne since at least 1437, as only those who had been living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>for</b> ten years could take up the position. He had not taken up citizenship immediately, possibly to avoid paying the 12 guilder fee. He was obliged to act as Ratsherr, and on 24 June 1447 he became a burgher of Cologne. The role of municipal councilor could only be held for a one-year term, with two years vacated before reoccupation. Lochner was re-elected for a second term in the winter of 1450–51, but died in office.|$|E

5|$|London was {{the premier}} centre for boxing because the aristocratic {{supporters}} of the sport dispersed to their country estates {{during the summer months}} but tended to congregate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>city</b> <b>for</b> the winter period. Birmingham was often portrayed as second only to London for the sport and in 1789 there were a series of challenges issued by fighters from the Birmingham area to opponents based around London. The challenges were intended to demonstrate the level of organisation and confidence among the Birmingham boxers and their supporters. Three of these challenges were accepted, including that from Perrins to Tom Johnson. Perrins had already issued a general challenge, offering to fight any man in England for a prize of 500 guineas, having beaten all challengers in the counties around Birmingham.|$|E

5|$|The {{designers}} {{conceived the}} Tallboys as town criers. Stilts were later added after Mitton noticed someone cleaning their office façade while wearing stilts; the town crier role {{was replaced with}} loudspeakers throughout Dunwall. The Tallboy design evolved into a lamplighter that would light street lamps with whale oil tanks, but after further development, the designers considered that their tall, mechanical legs allowed them to burn the dead and deal with plague-infected citizens while remaining above them and avoiding infection, leading to their final design as a guard armed with a bow. Mitton suggested adding a phosphorus canister to the Tallboys' backs for aesthetic reasons, but Smith suggested whale oil, which in turn led Mitton to design the whaling ships to give the whales a visible presence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>city.</b> <b>For</b> other technologies, designers conceptualized using 18th-century technology to build modern items and vehicles, and creating 18th-century items using modern tools.|$|E
