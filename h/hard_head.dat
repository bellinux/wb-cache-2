5|$|Throughout the Cold War, B-52s {{and other}} US {{strategic}} bombers performed airborne alert patrols under code {{names such as}} Head Start, Chrome Dome, <b>Hard</b> <b>Head,</b> Round Robin, and Giant Lance. Bombers loitered at high altitude near {{the borders of the}} Soviet Union to provide rapid first strike or retaliation capability in case of nuclear war. These airborne patrols formed one component of the US's nuclear deterrent, which would act to prevent the breakout of a large-scale war between the US and the Soviet Union under the concept of Mutually Assured Destruction.|$|E
500|$|On May 16, The Cincinnati Enquirer {{reported}} that Thomas would {{appear on the}} coin, not Foster. The paper also reported the controversy before the Commission of Fine Arts, that Melish had travelled to Washington the previous day, and had announced he had no objection to the change. Also on May 16, Melish telephoned Lee Lawrie, sculptor member of the Commission. Melish's notes indicate that Moore's objection was on behalf of Alice Roosevelt Longworth and the Longworth family, who had employed Thomas to lead the May Festival, and who wanted Thomas on the coin, although, as (per Melish) Lawrie put it, [...] "Thomas looks like a walrus and {{would be a very}} <b>hard</b> <b>head</b> to make". Melish was defiant, stating that he also knew Alice Longworth well, and Foster remained on the coin. Ortmayer remembered that the [...] "boss" [...] of the Bureau of the Mint (presumably Ross) objected to the reverse design, not liking the position of the goddess' legs. Swiatek, in his later volume, averred that Melish's association put pressure on the Department of the Treasury to approve Ortmayer's design.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1962, {{the wing}} began to {{participate}} in Operation Chrome Dome. [...] In Chrome Dome, the 42d flew fully combat-configured bombers along a routes across the Atlantic to the Mediterranean. In Operation <b>Hard</b> <b>Head</b> VI, the wing flew similar missions to monitor communications with the Thule, Greenland Ballistic Missile Early Warning System site. Tasking to support these two operations typically lasted from thirty to sixty days during which the wing maintained two B-52s airborne at all times. The wing's 42d Air Refueling Squadron provided air refueling for aircraft flying Chrome Dome missions.|$|E

2500|$|Described {{as a man}} of [...] "great {{political}} acumen" [...] {{and having}} [...] "a <b>hard</b> <b>head</b> for business", Fysh had a reputation as a stern, uncompromising taskmaster. This contrasted against his [...] "shy, quiet" [...] nature; he described himself as [...] "painfully shy...as a child feeling looked down on, sensitive, and socially lost." [...] Fysh felt these feelings never left him, being [...] "ill at ease with fame or publicity." [...] Described as single-minded in many instances, his insistence on using a D.H.86 (De Havilland Express 86) lead to a bitter clash and eventual fall-out between Fysh and Sir Gordon Taylor. Fysh also made rivals in other airline entrepreneurs such as Norman Brearley, a founder of Western Australian Airways.|$|E
2500|$|Cold War {{tensions}} between the United States and Russia {{came to a head}} in October 1962. [...] President John F. Kennedy informed the American public that the Soviet Union had installed missile sites in Cuba from which it could strike the United States. As a result, SAC canceled flying training and increased the size of its ground and airborne alert forces. The wing launched four B-52s on Chrome Dome and <b>Hard</b> <b>Head</b> VI missions, established the Loring Tanker Task Force, and aircraft not supporting airborne alert were put on ground alert. [...] During the Cuban Missile Crisis, wing bombers flew 132 airborne alert missions and its tankers flew 214 air refueling missions, transferring almost 24 million pounds of fuel to the B-52s.|$|E
2500|$|The Hister beetles {{lay their}} eggs in dead bodies and over {{a short period of}} time they develop into various stages. [...] The Histeridae larvae are {{destructive}} and when they hatch they eat the maggots in the dead body. [...] The stage of the beetle and other insects in the body at the time of investigation helps to determine the time of death. [...] "Beetle larvae are ... helpful when determining post-mortem time interval. Beetle larvae often reside in fly breeding resources, and they can be distinguished from fly larvae by the following: Beetle larvae possess a <b>hard,</b> <b>head</b> capsule, often brown in colour. Fly larvae lack a head capsule, instead having distinct, internal, black mouth hooks (cephalopharyngeal skeleton of mouthparts) at the anterior end of their body." [...] Understanding how long ago the eggs were laid and the time period of the developmental stages is important for determining the time of death.|$|E

At home he kept the <b>hard</b> <b>head</b> out of sight, and played at poetry and romance with his literary wife and his sturdy, passionate girls. He was a man of courage, not given to complaining, bearing his burdens by himself. No, he did not let the world intrude far into his home. He had a delicate, sensitive wife whose poetry won some fame in the narrow world of letters. He himself, with his tough old barbarian fighting spirit, had an almost child-like delight in verse, in sweet poetry, and in the delightful game of a cultured home. His blood was strong even to coarseness. But that only made the home more vigorous, more robust and Christmassy. There was always a touch of Christmas about him, now he was well off. If there was poetry after dinner, there were also chocolates and nuts, and good little out-of-the-way things to be munching.|$|E
