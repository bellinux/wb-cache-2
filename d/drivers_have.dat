5|$|As {{the first}} high speed railway system in Taiwan, THSRC started {{operation}} in 2007 {{with a lot}} of foreign talents including French and German train drivers and operation controllers in the Operation Control Center (OCC). At the same time, THSRC also started to train local drivers and controllers. Since May 2008, all controllers working in the OCC have been Taiwanese, and since October 2008, all train <b>drivers</b> <b>have</b> been Taiwanese.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side, the cement {{industry}} in Iran {{is one of}} the economic sectors that will be hit the hardest in Iran following of the subsidy reform plan, because many Iranian cement factories are energy inefficient (Notwithstanding possible adjustment and/or liberalization of commodities prices by the government during implementation). Taxi, delivery and truck <b>drivers</b> <b>have</b> also been adversely affected by the recent gas price increase. Experts believe that the removal of subsidies is likely to have an adverse impact on the profitability of the automotive sector {{for at least the next}} 2–3 years.|$|E
5|$|Sole tyre {{supplier}} Pirelli {{brought the}} medium, soft and supersoft tyres to the event, continuing the trend {{established in the}} Australian, Bahrain and Chinese Grands Prix. Per the regulations of the 2016 season, every driver needs to set aside one set {{each of the two}} softest compounds for the race and one set of the ultrasofts for Q3 (should they advance). The <b>drivers</b> <b>have</b> freedom of what other compounds they choose for the remaining ten out of thirteen sets.|$|E

5|$|Some truck <b>drivers</b> <b>have</b> {{used the}} pass despite the prohibition. They are {{generally}} either {{unaware of the}} restriction and following routes plotted by their GPS devices, or aware of it and willing to risk the fine {{for the sake of}} the time and distance saved. The resulting accidents have forced the closure of the pass. CDOT has put in larger signs advising drivers of the ban and worked with GPS device manufacturers so their software notes the restriction. Aspen officials have suggested the fines be increased as well.|$|E
5|$|Subwoofer {{output level}} can be {{increased}} by increasing cone surface area or by increasing cone excursion. Since large drivers require undesirably large cabinets, most subwoofer <b>drivers</b> <b>have</b> large excursions. Unfortunately, high excursion, at high power levels, tends to produce more distortion from inherent mechanical and magnetic effects in electro-dynamic drivers (the most common sort). The conflict between assorted goals can never be fully resolved; subwoofer designs are necessarily compromises. Hofmans's Iron Law (the efficiency of a woofer system is directly proportional to its cabinet volume and to the cube of its cutoff frequency) applies to subwoofers just as to all loudspeakers.|$|E
5|$|The Sloatsburg Metro-North {{station is}} located at the {{intersection}} of Municipal Plaza and Mills Street in the village of Sloatsburg, at 41.1565°N, -74.1913°W. It is accessible from the New York State Thruway (I-87) at Interchange 15A, and <b>drivers</b> <b>have</b> to follow the nearby New York State Route 17 to Municipal Plaza, where the station is visible. There are connections to other places, via the Transport of Rockland Route 93 and Short Line Bus Routes 17M and 17MD. However, these are not accessible at the station, but at the nearby State Route 17 (also known as Orange Turnpike). There is also one taxicab service to Sloatsburg called Sammy's Cab.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) {{released}} {{the results of}} a five-year-long study (the Highway Serial Killings Initiative) investigating the unsolved murders of prostitutes, hitchhikers, and stranded motorists. Over 500 female victims have been compiled in a database, most of whom were killed or discarded at truck stops, hotels, and roadsides. The FBI has speculated that many of these victims were murdered by long-haul truck drivers, some of whom may be serial killers. Investigators speculate that the easy access to potential victims, mobility, and lack of supervision enjoyed by long-haul truck <b>drivers</b> <b>have</b> contributed to this phenomenon. The head of the initiative, Michael Harrigan, says most of the victims lead high-risk lifestyles (e.g., prostitution) which left them particularly vulnerable. In 2004, the FBI began investigating a string of murders in which the victims were found along the Interstate 40 corridor in Oklahoma and several other states, which sparked the creation of the Highway Serial Killings Initiative.|$|E
5|$|The race saw the {{competitive}} début of Pirelli's new ultrasoft tyre compound, which was provided alongside the supersoft and soft compounds. Per the regulations of the 2016 season, every driver needs {{to set aside}} one set {{each of the two}} softest compounds for the race and one set of the ultrasofts for Q3 (should they advance). The <b>drivers</b> <b>have</b> freedom of what other compounds they choose for the remaining ten out of thirteen sets. From this race onwards, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile allowed drivers to choose alternative helmet designs for one race weekend per season, a practice usually prohibited as they have to wear the same design to make them more recognisable to spectators and television audiences. As a consequence, Felipe Massa's helmet featured extensive artwork by graffiti artist Os Gêmeos, teammate Valtteri Bottas featured casino-inspired imagery and Haas driver Romain Grosjean sported a tribute to the late Jules Bianchi on his helmet. The race marked a reason for celebration at McLaren, as the team had started their first ever Grand Prix at Monaco fifty years earlier.|$|E

25|$|Magnetostrictive transducers, {{based on}} magnetostriction, have been {{predominantly}} used as sonar ultrasonic sound wave radiators, but their use has spread also to audio speaker systems. Magnetostrictive speaker <b>drivers</b> <b>have</b> some special advantages: {{they can provide}} greater force (with smaller excursions) than other technologies; low excursion can avoid distortions from large excursion as in other designs; the magnetizing coil is stationary and therefore more easily cooled; they are robust because delicate suspensions and voice coils are not required. Magnetostrictive speaker modules have been produced by Fostex and FeONIC and subwoofer <b>drivers</b> <b>have</b> also been produced.|$|E

One train driver interviewed in 2009 reported that he had worked as a driver for Vietnam Railways for over 10 years without receiving any training or professional development to improve his skills, which he had learned in Russia. Checks on <b>drivers</b> <b>have</b> also been suggested, along with random blood testing to detect whether <b>drivers</b> <b>have</b> used alcohol.|$|E
