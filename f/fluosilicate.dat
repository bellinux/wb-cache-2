40|$|Fluorite, barite and calcite are {{important}} industry minerals. However, they often co-exist, presenting difficulty in selectively separating them {{due to their}} similar surface properties. In this study, valonea extract and sodium <b>fluosilicate</b> were used as depressants to selectively separate them by flotation, with sodium oleate as the collector. The single mineral flotation results showed that valonea extract displayed the strongest depression on calcite, while sodium <b>fluosilicate</b> displayed the strongest depression on barite. These two depressants allowed selective separation of the three minerals through sequential flotation. The flotation of mixed minerals showed that 94 % of the calcite was successfully depressed by the valonea extract, and 95 % recovery of the fluorite was achieved in the subsequent flotation with sodium <b>fluosilicate</b> depressing barite. The different depressant–mineral interactions were investigated via electro-kinetic studies and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the Materials Studio 6. 0 program. The valonea extract exhibited the strongest adsorption on the calcite surface, and sodium <b>fluosilicate</b> exhibited the strongest adsorption on the barite surface, which prevented oleate species from reacting with Ca 2 + or Ba 2 + surface sites.

40|$|An {{electron}} paramagnetic resonance {{study was}} performed on single crystals of copper <b>fluosilicate</b> hexahydrate. EPR signals correspond to three tetragonally distorted pctahedral Cu(II) ions (A site) with g values: g 11 = 2. 390, gJ.. = 2. 093, and ·one regular octahedral Cu(II) ion (B site) with g = 2. 093. The spectra are thus quite different from those observed earlier by Bleaney and Ingram in Cu(II) :ZnSiF 6 • 6 H 20. <b>Fluosilicate</b> hexahydrates of divalent metals belong {{to a series of}} crystals wellsuited for X-ray, magnetic susceptibility and anisotropy, {{electron paramagnetic resonance}}, optical, and other studies (J- 4). Observations of an isotropic EPR signal at 90 K and above and anisotropic EPR signals at 20 K by Bleaney and Ingram (J) in Cu:ZnSiF 6 • 6 H 20 provided the first experimental evidence of the Jahn-Teller effect. A determination of crystal structures of this series by Ray eta/. (2, 3) has revealed that copper(II) <b>fluosilicate</b> hexahydrate (3), contrary to earlier belief, is not isomorphous with zinc <b>fluosilicate</b> hexahydrate. The structure is still rhombohedral (space group R 3) with a cell four times as large as that supposed earlier. The unit cell, which has dimensions a = b = 18. 18 A and c = 9. 857 A, contains three magnetically nonequivalent tetragonally distorted Cu(II) · 6 H 20 octahedra (Cu- 0 (1) = 1. 97 A, Cu- 0 (2) = 1. 97 A, Cu- 0 (3) = 2. 367 A) designated as the A sites; and one regular Cu(II) · 6 H 20 octahedron (Cu- 0 = 2. 074 A) designated as the B site.

40|$|Matrix {{acidizing}} {{is used in}} carbonate formations {{to create}} wormholes that connect the formation to the wellbore. Hydrochloric acid, organic acids, or mixtures of these acids are typically used in matrix acidizing treatments of carbonate reservoirs. However, {{the use of these}} acids in deep wells has some major drawbacks including high and uncontrolled reaction rate and corrosion to well tubulars, especially those made of chrome-based tubulars (Cr- 13 and duplex steel), and these problems become severe at high temperatures. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) and its based fluids have a major drawback in stimulating shallow (low fracture gradient) formations as they may cause face dissolution (formation surface washout) if injected at low rates. The objective of stimulation of sandstone reservoirs is to remove the damage caused to the production zone during drilling or completion operations. Many problems may occur during sandstone acidizing with Hydrochloric/Hydrofluoric acids (HCl/HF) mud acid. Among those problems: decomposition of clays in HCl acids, precipitation of <b>fluosilicates,</b> the presence of carbonate can cause the precipitation of calcium fluorides, silica-gel filming, colloidal silica-gel precipitation, and mixing between various stages of the treatment. To overcome problems associated with strong acids, chelating agents were introduced and used in the field. However, major concerns with most of these chemicals are their limited dissolving power and negative environmental impact. Glutamic acid diacetic acid (GLDA) a newly developed environmentally friendly chelate was examined as stand-alone stimulation fluid in deep oil and gas wells. In this study we used GLDA to stimulate carbonate cores (calcite and dolomite). GLDA was also used to stimulate and remove the damage from different sandstone cores containing different compositions of clay minerals. Carbonate cores (calcite and dolomite) of 6 and 20 in. length and 1. 5 in. diameter were used in the coreflood experiments. Coreflood experiments were run at temperatures ranging from 180 to 300 oF. Ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA), hydroxyl ethylethylene diaminetriacetic acid (HEDTA), and GLDA were used to stimulate and remove the damage from different sandstone cores at high temperatures. X-ray Computed Topography (CT) scans were used to determine the effectiveness of these fluids in stimulation calcite and dolomite cores and removing the damage from sandstone cores. The sandstone cores used in this study contain from 1 to 18 wt percent illite (swellable and migratable clay mineral). GLDA was found to be highly effective in creating wormholes over a wide range of pH (1. 7 - 13) in calcite cores. Increasing temperature enhanced the reaction rate, more calcite was dissolved, and larger wormholes were formed for different pH with smaller volumes of GLDA solutions. GLDA has a prolonged activity and leads to a decreased surface spending resulting in face dissolution and therefore acts deeper in the formation. In addition, GLDA was very effective in creating wormholes in the dolomite core as it is a good chelate for magnesium. Coreflood experiments showed that at high pH values (pH = 11) GLDA, HEDTA, and EDTA were almost the same in increasing the permeability of both Berea and Bandera sandstone cores. GLDA, HEDTA, and EDTA were compatible with Bandera sandstone cores which contains 10 wt percent Illite. The weight loss from the core was highest in case of HEDTA and lowest in case of GLDA at pH 11. At low pH values (pH = 4) 0. 6 M GLDA performed better than 0. 6 M HEDTA in the coreflood experiments. The permeability ratio (final/initial) for Bandera sandstone cores was 2 in the case of GLDA and 1. 2 in the case of HEDTA at pH of 4 and 300 oF. At high pH HEDTA was the best chelating agent to stimulate different sandstone cores, and at low pH GLDA was the best one. For Berea sandstone cores EDTA at high pH of 11 was the best in increasing the permeability of the core at 300 oF. The low pH GLDA based fluid has been especially designed for high temperature oil well stimulation in carbonate and sandstone rock. Extensive studies have proved that GLDA effectively created wormholes in carbonate cores, is gentle to most types of casing including Cr-based tubular, has a high thermal stability and gives no unwanted interactions with carbonate or sandstone formations. These unique properties ensure that it can be safely used under extreme conditions for which the current technologies do not give optimal results. Furthermore, this stimulation fluid contributes to a sustainable future as it based on readily biodegradable GLDA that is made from natural and renewable raw material...|$|R

Only a single narrow line was observed for protons for any arbitrary orientation of a single crystal {{with respect to the}} applied magnetic field. This can be interpreted in terms of a phase-correlated flip motion of the interproton vectors between two disordered orientations or in terms of a hindered rotation of the Fe(H 2 O) 6 octahedron about the fourfold axes, together with the flip motion. The fluorine second moment indicated that the SiF 6 octahedron also is undergoing reorientation. The temperature variation of the powder linewidth showed a transition around 195 °K and led to rather low values for the potential barriers hindering the motions. No significant temperature variation of the linewidth was observed for hexahydrated cobalt <b>fluosilicate</b> in the temperature range between 90 °K and room temperature.

40|$|The role of {{hydrofluoric}} acid in the flotation separation of feldspare with dodecylammonium acetate as collector was studied. The results obtained {{were as follows}} : (1) The Hallimond tube tests showed that the floatability of feldspar with DAA reached to the maximum at pH 10 and was poor at pH less than 3 or more than 12,which was attributed to the adsorption properties of DAA on the mineral. The isoelectric point of feldspar in DAA solutions found by the Zeta potential studies was measured at pH 3. 5 and electrostatic force contributed to the adsorption of DAA on the untreated samples. (2) Hydrofluoric acid or fluorides activates feldspare in acidic solution, increases the adsorption of DAA {{on the surface of}} the feldspar, and consequently most efficient flotation is observed. Potassium fluoride showed good activating properties among many fluorides. (3) Chemisorption of DAA on the feldspar prepared in {{hydrofluoric acid}} solution might play a predominant role in flotation of feldspar regardless of the Zeta potential in solutions. The formation of fluosilicates are predicted as the reaction products of feldspar surface with hydrofluoric acid. (4) The presense of hydrofluoric acid is requisite for coagulation of feldspar fines. Potassium <b>fluosilicate</b> showed a marked effect on the adsorption of DAA and the adhesive property to air bubble, thus the activation of feldspar by hydrofluoric acid was related to the formation of the alkali metal fluosilicates.

40|$|Nuclear {{alignment}} {{has been}} on established technique in nuclear physics for some years {{and the majority of}} the experiments have employed the methods suggested by Bleaney (1951) and by Rose (1949) and Gerter (1948). The former is simpler since it requires no external fields. For this method the nucleus must be the core of a paramagnetic ion which is included in a crystal with suitable internal fields. The alignment arises through anisotropic hyperfine structure (S(off) = [illegible fraction]) or isotropic hyperfine structure with a finite splitting of the electronic levels caused by the crystalline field (D≠OS≥ 1). Certain nuclear states will become predominantly populated at very low temperatures which can conveniently be produced by adiabatic demagnetisation of an ion incorporated in the same salt. Paramagnetism arises through vacancies in the 3 f and 4 d electronic shell so that those nuclei studied fall in the iron-transition and rare-earth groups. The former can be conveniently incorporated with the salts of the Tutton series (double sulphates) or the double nitrates, both of which have been extensively studied. However, the Tutton salts have two ions per unit cell giving rise to two alignment axes inclined at about 70 ° while for some of the iron group elements (e. g. Co ++, Mn ++) the double nitrates have two positions in the unit cell with different hyperfine constants Following the successful cooling of nickel-zinc <b>fluosilicate</b> by adiabatic demagnetisation (Hill, Meyer & Milner 1959) it was realised that this salt which has one ion per unit cell might be suitable for nuclear orientation and indeed have some advantages over the other salts. All the principal experiments described in this thesis have been performed with nickel-zinc <b>fluosilicate.</b> The angular distribution of the gamma-radiation from an aligned nucleus is not in general isotropic, the anisotropy depending on the degree of alignment and decay characteristics of the isotope. Thus by measuring the anisotropy it is possible to deduce values for some of the nuclear parameters such as the angular moments and magnetic moment of the levels involved.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop analytical: methods for the determination of trace elements in artificially grown marine plankton samples to provide a knowledge of metal concentrations in marine plankton. Samples were dissolved in a mixture of HF and HNO 3 acids either in teflon beakers on a hot plate or in sealed vessels in a microwave oven. In flame atomic absorption spectrometric determinations (FAAS), it was necessary to complex fluoride with boric acid to prevent the precipitation of lanthanum fluoride. For the determination of calcium in air-acetylene flame, silicon had to be removed by heating to dryness, while for that of strontium the use of nitrous oxide-acetylene flame was essential. ^ Lead was determined by hydride generation FAAS. Plumbane was trapped on the interior of a slotted quartz tube under fuel-lean conditions followed by atomization with the introduction of isobutylmethyl ketone. Although the detection limit was considerably improved, it was not linear with increasing trapping period due to the impurities in the reagents. ^ A method was developed for total elemental characterization of marine plankton samples by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Matrix induced signal suppressions were corrected by internal standardization. The method was applied to the analysis of plankton samples including several whose growth media had been enriched with selenium. The plankton samples were able to tolerate higher mercury concentrations as the selenium concentration increased. ^ The effect of sodium on removal of silicon by heating to dryness was investigated. Evaporation as SiF 4 was unsuccessful in the presence of sodium due the precipitation as sodium <b>fluosilicate.</b> Thus, sodium <b>fluosilicate</b> was first precipitated in acidic solution followed by extractions with mixtures of methanol/nitric acid to recover elements.

40|$|Sandstone {{reservoir}} acidizing is {{a complex}} and heterogeneous acid-rock reaction process. If improper acid treatment is implemented, further damage can be induced instead of removing the initial plug, particularly in high-temperature sandstone reservoirs. An efficient acid system {{is the key to}} successful acid treatment. High-temperature sandstone treatment with conventional mud acid system faces problems including high acid-rock reaction rate, short acid effective distance, susceptibility to secondary damage, and serious corrosion to pipelines. In this paper, a new multichelating acid system has been developed to overcome these shortcomings. The acid system is composed of ternary weak acid, organic phosphonic chelating agent, anionic polycarboxylic acid chelating dispersant, fluoride, and other assisted additives. Hydrogen ion slowly released by multistage ionization in ternary weak acid and organic phosphonic within the system decreases the concentration of HF to achieve retardation. Chelating agent and chelating dispersant within the system inhibited anodic and cathodic reaction, respectively, to protect the metal from corrosion, while chelating dispersant has great chelating ability on iron ions, restricting the depolarization reaction of ferric ion and metal. The synergic effect of chelating agent and chelating dispersant removes sulfate scale precipitation and inhibits or decreases potential precipitation such as CaF 2, silica gel, and <b>fluosilicate.</b> Mechanisms of retardation, corrosion-inhibition, and scale-removing features have been discussed and evaluated with laboratory tests.

Struvite crystals of the largest sizes were produced in a DTM crystallizer of working volume 36 dm 3 at 20 % excess of magnesium ions, at pH 9 and for elongated mean residence time 7200 s. Excess of magnesium ions in a process system influenced the struvite reaction crystallization process yield definitely advantageously. Concentration of phosphate(V) ions decreased from 0. 445 mass % in a feed to 1. 810 – 3 mass % in a postprocessed mother solution, what {{can be regarded as}} a very good result of their removal process. In product crystals, besides main component – struvite, also all impurities originally present in wastewater appeared in a form of hydroxides, phosphates and other salts. Aluminium, copper, iron and zinc ions were the subject of practically total co- precipitation with struvite...|$|E
40|$|Corrosion-resistant {{films were}} formed on {{aluminum}} by immersion in solutions of basic chromic sulfate, plus <b>fluosilicate,</b> with alkali added to near, or slightly beyond, precipitation of insoluble basic compounds. The trivalent chromium films formed on 7075 -T 6 or 2024 -T 3 aluminum, when tested in 5 -percent NaCl salt spray, provided corrosion resistance {{in excess of}} 96 hr. When a post-treatment of peroxide or permanganate solution was applied, corrosion resistance for both alloys almost reached 336 hr and sometimes exceeded this value. In most cases, only a 10 -min immersion was necessary at 25 "C to obtain a corrosion-resistant film. Trivalentchromium-treated aluminum served as an effective base for an epoxy paint primer. Anodized aluminum was afforded excellent corrosion resistance, comparable to dichromate, by sealing in dilute basic chromic sulfate solution and post-treated with peroxide. C hromate conversioncoatings have found widespread commercial and military applications on aluminum alloys and zinc or cadmium electrodeposits. Of particular interest to the Navy {{is the use of}} chromate coatings on aircrafl aluminum alloys, because of excellent corrosion resistance and the ability to serve as an effective base for paint. The bathsusedtodevelopthiscoatingcontainchromates (hexavalent chromium), and it is the residual chromates in the coating that are largely responsible for the high degree of corrosion inhibition observed. Chromates are highly toxic, however, and theirpresence in wastewater effluents is severely restricted. It would, therefore, be highly desirable to develop a coating for aluminum alloys utilizing relatively non-toxic chemicals that could serve as an alternative to chromate coating. Preliminary studies were conducted with molybdate solutions that produced thin colored films (presumably molybdic oxides) on immersed 7075 -T 6 AI alloy, but that possessed only slight salt spray resistance. With additives, corrosion resistance of about 24 hr salt spray exposure was achieved as, for example, by 5 -min immersion at 25 "C in the following bath: 6 g/L Na,MoO, 4 gfL NaLSiF, 5 g/L Na,PO,. 2 H,...|$|E
