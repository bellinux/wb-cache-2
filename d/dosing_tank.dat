40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an in vitro study evaluating if detoxification and oxidative stress enzymes ethoxyresorufin-O-dethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and catalase (CAT) can reflect the effect thermally treated and untreated oil-based drilling waste has on Atlantic salmon parr (Salmo salar), {{and how these}} biomarkers {{can be used in}} future monitoring of drilling waste discharges. Fish were exposed for 3, 7 and 14 days to high (1 ppm oil) and low (0. 1 ppm oil) doses of treated and untreated drilling waste, followed by a one week recovery period. EROD analysis was performed fluorometrically using NADPH as a substrate. GST and CAT activities were determined photometrically utilising CDNB and H 2 O 2 as substrates. Values from all three assays were protein normalised. The results showed that EROD activity in fish exposed to the high dose of untreated drilling waste peaked after 3 days of exposure reaching an average of 3. 7 ± 4. 2 nmol/min/mg protein. A secondary rise was observed after 14 days, continuing post-recovery. EROD activity in fish exposed to the high dose of treated waste peaked at 4. 0 ± 4. 3 nmol/min/mg protein after 14 days of exposure. The low <b>dose</b> treated <b>tank</b> reached the highest value at 4. 1 ± 3. 9 nmol/min/mg protein, after 3 exposure days. The late EROD responses after 14 days of exposure support a theory about a delayed biological metabolisation of PAHs, judged from PAH metabolite concentrations in the fish bile. GST activity in the high <b>dose</b> untreated <b>tank</b> was at its highest after 7 days of exposure with 0. 030 ± 0. 004 U mg protein. The high <b>dose</b> treated <b>tank</b> reached its peak after 3 days of exposure with 0. 032 ± 0. 012 U mg protein. CAT activity was at its highest in all tanks including control at 3 days into the exposure, with 0. 619 ± 0. 087 U mg protein in the high <b>dose</b> untreated <b>tank</b> and 0. 567 ± 0. 216 U mg protein in the high <b>dose</b> treated <b>tank.</b> The low <b>dose</b> <b>tanks,</b> treated and untreated, reached 0. 570 ± 0. 186 and 0. 550 ± 0. 066 U mg protein respectively. Although some responses were consistent with other biomarkers in the study, it was concluded that the enzyme parameters were not significantly reflective of the effect the drilling waste had on the fish. Too many unidentifiably caused responses in the low <b>dose</b> and control <b>tanks</b> masked the moderate effects seen in the high <b>dose</b> <b>tanks.</b> EROD, GST and CAT alone would therefore not be sensitive enough for biomonitoring drilling waste discharges to the level of contamination used in this study...|$|R

A single dose of purified polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) -coated gold nanorods was added to a series of three replicate estuarine mesocosms to emulate an abrupt nanoparticle release event to a tidal creek of a Spartina-dominated estuary. The mesocosms contained several phases that were monitored: seawater, natural sediments, mature cordgrass, juvenile northern quahog clam, mud snails, and grass shrimp. Aqueous nanorod concentrations rose rapidly upon initial dosing and then fell to stable levels over the course of approximately 50 h, after which they remained stable {{for the remainder of the}} experiment (41 days total). The concentration of nanorods rose in all other phases during the initial phase of the experiment; however, some organisms demonstrated depuration over extended periods of time (100 + h) before removal from the <b>dosed</b> <b>tanks.</b> Clams and biofilm samples were also removed from the contaminated tanks post-exposure to monitor their depuration in pristine seawater.

As a chordate, it is our nearest invertebrate relative and therefore shares many of our important biochemical pathways. By treating its water with clinical drugs, we can inhibit mechano-transductive pathways, tuning the stiffness of the extracellular matrix and causing a global vascular regression. Since the summer of 2016, we have hosted a breeding colony on the Boise State University campus. In the future we intend to use the sea squirt as a model system for investigation of chemical and mechanical circuits in a living organism. Keeping these animals alive in land-locked environments presents a unique challenge as they require precisely controlled saltwater tank conditions.

40|$|Combined sewer {{overflows}} {{contribute significantly}} to pathogen loads in surface water. Some chemical disinfectants such as chlorine have proved to reduce the levels of microorganisms even in complex matrices such as wastewater in combined sewer systems; however, some of them release toxic by-products into water bodies and increase costs of plant maintenance and repair. In this study, we determined if performic acid (PFA) disinfection units can be operated at decentralized treatment facilities and reduce bacteria, viruses, and protozoan parasites in combined sewer overflows (CSOs). The PFA dosing unit at the inflow of a CSO storage <b>tank</b> <b>dosed</b> a fixed flow volume into the inflowing stormwater and, thus, concentrations varied between approximately 12 – 24 mg l− 1. The results showed a reduction of most hygienically relevant bacteria with mean removal efficiencies of 1. 8 log 10 for Aeromonas spp. and 3. 1 log 10 for E. coli. For viruses, however, reduction was only observed for somatic coliphages with 2. 7 log 10. In this setting, PFA {{does not seem to}} be suitable to remove e. g. protozoan parasites such as Giardia lamblia. In terms of operation, dosing the substance is uncritical in decentralized facilities, but the PFA needs too much time to react with pathogens after being dosed into the overflow of CSO storage tanks and before dilution with surface water in most facilities. © 2016 Elsevier Gmb...|$|R
40|$|Clean {{drinking}} water is often {{taken for granted}} in first world countries, such as the United States. However, thousands of colonias residents (settlements in the Southwest US that lack access to basic infrastructure) still lack access to clean {{drinking water}}. Such {{is the case in}} the Paso Del Norte Region. In Doña Ana County, NM, and El Paso County, TX, colonia residents typically rely on shallow domestic wells and hauled water, respectively. However, both water sources can pose health concerns from elevated total dissolved solids and microbiological contamination. With connection to centralized water treatment and distribution still years away, colonias require a more immediate and effective solution for their current situation. This research proposed that such a solution could be achieved with a point-of-use (POU) water treatment system. The goal of this project was to provide colonia residents with an economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable water treatment system. The objectives of this study were to: (1) assess user preferences and actual water quality data in order to design a household-level water treatment system; (2) develop a holistic point-of-use technology evaluation system that can be used by residents to screen and select a POU drinking water system for their home; and (3) evaluate methods for preserving water quality in drinking water storage tanks. First, focus group studies were conducted in colonias to discuss possible water treatment options and record residents’ perceptions and preferences. Water samples were collected from willing participants and analyzed for basic drinking water quality parameters. Second, many types of commercially available water treatment technologies were reviewed and analyzed, and a five-component evaluation and ranking system was developed to facilitate selection and implementation in colonias. Third, experiments were performed to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of using copper and/or hypochlorite treatment to control algae and preserve water quality in storage tanks. The research performed in this study showed that colonias that rely on groundwater face more challenges, in the form of microbiological contamination and high salinity, than colonias that rely on hauled water. A treatment train of basic cartridge filtration and point-of-use desalination was proposed to address the water quality issues in colonias relying on well water or hauled water. It was also determined that the most economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable system was an under-the-sink reverse osmosis (RO) unit. This research also yielded a system of preserving water quality in drinking water tanks, which includes chlorine monitoring and <b>dosing,</b> periodic <b>tank</b> cleaning, and the possible use of copper as an algaecide. ...|$|R

40|$|Fungicides are {{commonly}} applied as prophylactic sprays, {{with the expectation}} of increased yield and kernel quality, to control husk spot of macadamia in Australia. However, economic benefits from fungicide applications to control husk spot have rarely been quantified. We investigated the effectiveness, efficiency and economic returns of fungicide spray applications for husk spot control using three different spray application volumes and two <b>dose</b> rates of <b>tank</b> mixtures of carbendazim and cupric hydroxide under commercial macadamia orchard conditions. Husk spot incidence and severity were significantly (P < 0. 001) different among the treatments and between the two years. In both years, the rate of fruit abscission was highest in the untreated control followed by low spray application volumes, but reduced with increasing spray volume. The quality and value of nut-in-shell increased when nut abscission was delayed. Poor quality and low nut-in-shell value of $ 2. 85 kg(- 1) in 2010 and $ 2. 12 kg(- 1) in 2011 were obtained in the untreated control trees that abscised early in the harvest period compared with the average nut-in-shell value of $ 2. 95 kg(- 1) in 2010 and $ 2. 46 kg(- 1) in 2011 in the fungicide treated trees. Gross margins for each fungicide treatment schedule compared to the untreated control averaged over both years showed positive contributions of 20 %, 10 % and 6 % for the high, moderate and low dilute rate volume applications, respectively. Our data further indicates that dilute rate applications at higher volume may be more beneficial and cost-effective than concentrate rate applications in husk spot control programs. Overall, harvest yield increased by 11 %- 33 % when husk spot was controlled using fungicide sprays compared to no fungicide spray applications.

40|$|After {{remediation}} and {{closure of}} the high-level waste tanks at Hanford (and at other DOE sites), residual radionuclide-bearing solids {{will remain in the}} form of sludge and hard heel adhering to the inner surfaces of the tanks. Radionuclide release from these residuals represents a potentially significant source of contaminants migrating in the sediments underlying the tanks. A recent composite analysis for the Hanford Site has shown the radionuclide source term from the residual solids {{to be one of the}} most significant long-term dose contributors on site, essentially equivalent in magnitude to a number of well-known discharges from leaking single-shell tanks. However, this assessment was based on a highly conservative release model for the tank residuals. The conservative model is being used in lieu of a true scientific understanding of the processes controlling the release rate from the sludge that is applicable to the Hanford vadose zone environment. Currently, the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) is planning to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to remove 99 % or more of the waste from Hanford high-level waste tanks that may have no real long-term environmental benefit. Through this project, we will significantly improve the fundamental scientific basis for estimating the release rate of 99 Tc, the principal long-term <b>dose</b> contributor from <b>tank</b> residual wastes. We envision an improved conceptual model that considers diffusion of water and oxygen in the sludge under conditions of partial hydraulic saturation, but 100 % relative humidity, consistent with the subsurface environment at Hanford. Key chemical processes are also considered, including the oxidation of reduced Tc compounds in the sludge and the chemical changes in sludge phase assemblage that will occur over time. A combination of novel experimental methods is proposed to investigate these processes. This comprehensive study will provide a sound technical basis for DOE and local stake holders to make more informed cost/benefit/risk decisions regarding closure of Hanford high-level waste tanks...|$|R
40|$|Concentrations of the weakly {{oestrogenic}} {{degradation products}} of alkylphenol polyethoxylate (APE) surfactants (nonylphenol, octylphenol, nonylphenol monoethoxylate and nonylphenol diethoxylate) were measured {{in water and}} sediments from British rivers and estuaries collected during 1994 and 1995. In addition, a series of samples of tissues of wild fish from the River Aire, and from a laboratory dosing experiment were analysed for alkylphenols, to assess the degree of bioaccumulation of these compounds. Measurable concentrations of APE residues were recorded in the River Aire (15 – 76 μg/l total extractable alkylphenols), the River Mersey (6 – 11 μg/l) and the Tees estuary (up to 76 μg/l). These levels exceed, or are close to, the no observed effect concentration for the induction of vitellogenesis in caged trout (5 – 20 μg/l total extractable alkylphenols), and may be sufficient to exert an oestrogenic effect on fish populations in these areas. A sediment sample from Bingley on the River Aire contained 15 μg/g (dry weight) nonylphenol, and concentrations in sediments from the Tees and Mersey estuaries exceeded 1 μg/g. These rivers receive a variety of trade waters via sewage treatment works (STW) effluents containing significant concentrations of APE. Elsewhere, concentrations in water and sediments were near or below limits of detection and biological effects are unlikely, suggesting that any oestrogenic effects observed in sewage outfalls and rivers not directly impacted by APE-containing trade-waters {{may be caused by}} other chemicals.
