5|$|Boitani {{discusses}} the modern {{use of the}} character of Troilus in a chapter entitled Eros and Thanatos. Love and death, the latter either as a tragedy in itself or as an epic symbol of Troy's own destruction, therefore, are the two core elements of the Troilus myth for the editor of the first book-length survey of it from ancient to modern times. <b>He</b> <b>sees</b> <b>the</b> character as incapable of transformation on a heroic scale in the manner of Ulysses and also blocked from the possibility of development as an archetypal figure of troubled youth by Hamlet. Troilus' appeal for the 20th and 21st century is his very humanity.|$|E

5|$|In these stanzas, Donne {{compares the}} parting of two lovers to a death, {{desiring}} the lovers' parting to be quiet, without struggle, and voluntary {{even though it}} is inevitable. At the same time, he considers the separation of lovers to be equivalent to the soul separating from the body on death. Ramie Targoff argues that this is not because <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>the</b> separation of the lovers as permanent, like death, but that as with death Donne finds the challenge with separation to be ensuring the relationship's continuity in the future.|$|E

Behind the courting group, an oncoming storm looms, a symbol of the destruction which the dancers and lovers are about to bring upon themselves.|$|E

Emily Shelby is averse to this idea because she had promised her maid that her child would never be sold; Emily's son, George Shelby, hates to see Tom go because <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>the</b> man as his friend and mentor.|$|E

60|$|For which reason, with {{a sinking}} heart {{and with that}} hang-dog sense of guilt upon him which dread and {{watching}} enfolded in the Sol's Arms have produced, the young man {{of the name of}} Guppy presents himself at the town mansion at about seven o'clock in the evening and requests to see her ladyship.

5|$|On a {{freezing}} Sunday morning, Marge gathers {{the family}} to go to church. Homer refuses to go, much to her annoyance and dismay, after <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>the</b> weather outside and accidentally tears his church trousers. Staying behind, he sleeps in late, dances in his underwear (à la Tom Cruise in the film Risky Business), makes his special waffle recipe, wins a radio trivia contest, watches an action-packed football game, and finds a penny. Homer attributes his good fortune to skipping church and declares it the best day of his life. Meanwhile, Marge and the kids shiver {{their way through a}} rambling sermon, only to find themselves trapped at the end since the door has frozen shut.
