On their arrival in Palestine the 6th Airlanding Brigade was concentrated in the Gaza area while they acclimatised to the conditions.|$|E
25|$|Switzerland was not invaded {{because its}} {{mountain}} {{bridges and tunnels}} between Germany and Italy were too vital <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> into war. Also, the Swiss banks provided necessary access to international markets by dealing in pilfered gold. There were 18,000 Jews living in Switzerland {{at the onset of}} World War II. The country did not turn over their own Jews to the Germans, but according to three anonymous eyewitnesses, allowed the Holocaust trains (aware of them since 1942) to use the Gotthard Tunnel {{on the way to the}} camps. Most war supplies to Italy were shipped through the Austrian Brenner Pass.|$|E

25|$|The {{climate of}} Portadown {{is like that}} {{of much of the}} rest of the UK and Ireland, being a {{temperate}} oceanic climate. It has mild temperatures throughout the year, with summer temperatures not reaching levels to be deemed very hot and winter not very cold. Summer temperatures can reach more than 20°C though it is rare <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> higher than 30°C (86°F). The consistently humid climate that prevails over Ireland can make these temperatures feel uncomfortable when they stray into the high 20's °C (80–85°F), more so than similar temperatures in hotter climates in the rest of Europe. It also receives a steady amount of rainfall throughout the year.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a common}} sense of {{confusion}} between the difference of PTSD and a normal response to trauma. If an athlete injures himself or herself in a horrific way, it is normal <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through some adversity before overcoming the injury. They may develop small flashbacks, have bad dreams, or feel like they can't get the traumatic experience out of their mind, however, depending on the athlete’s mental ability, or how determined they are within their chosen sport, these symptoms can be lifted in time. Along with this, those athletes who are weaker mentally {{are the ones who}} tend to not be able to recover themselves and fall into the category of PTSD.|$|E
25|$|Evictions in 1943 {{were also}} limited, as {{hundreds}} of Africans told to leave in the Blantyre District refused to leave as there was no land <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to, and the colonial authorities declined to use force. The Governor expected that more would take place in 1948 and also anticipated considerable trouble as in 1943. However, eviction notices were suspended because of the serious famine in 1949 until 1950. By September 1950, enough land had been obtained for resettlement and the evictions proceeded’ although they were resisted. The Governor of Nyasaland therefore set up a committee to review the 1928 ordinance and to suggest amendments. The committee proposed to end 5-yearly evictions and growing economic crops in lieu of rent, but to increase rents to an economic level, but with reductions for unmarried and other single women.|$|E

25|$|At a small café, Enjolras exhorts a {{group of}} idealistic {{students}} to prepare for revolution. Marius interrupts the serious atmosphere by fantasizing about his new-found love, much to the amusement of his compatriots, particularly the wine-loving Grantaire ("The ABC Café—Red and Black"). When Gavroche brings the news of General Lamarque's death, the students realize {{that they can use}} the public's dismay to incite their revolution and that their time has come ("Do You Hear the People Sing?"). At Valjean's house, Cosette thinks about her chance meeting with Marius and later confronts Valjean about the secrets he keeps about his and her own past ("Rue Plumet—In My Life"). Éponine leads Marius to Valjean's house (despite being heartbroken that he has fallen in love with another), and he and Cosette meet again and confess their mutual love ("A Heart Full of Love"). Thénardier and his gang arrive, intending to rob Valjean's house, but Éponine stops them by screaming a warning ("The Attack on Rue Plumet"). The scream alerts Valjean, who believes that the intruder was Javert. He tells Cosette that it's time once again <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on the run, and starts planning for them to flee France altogether.|$|E

It seems as if Godsmack heard the cry of their dedicated hoard and went back to making the kind of record that defined them.", then he added, [...] "Those fans seeking a return to Godsmack’s roots will not be disappointed; for others, the sound may be a retrenchment because there was no place else <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> The only undebatable thing is that The Oracle is the most aggressive disc Godsmack have issued since their debut." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{month after}} its début, German troops were still panicking {{when confronted by}} the {{machines}} but on 28 September, a party of Germans attacked a bogged tank and managed {{to get on the}} roof, only to find that there was still no way to fire inside. Rifle-fire was seen to be futile and machine-gun fire appeared only to work only with S.m.K. bullets, when concentrated in one place. It was considered that a hand-grenade would be just as useless but that one with the heads of six more wired around it would have enough explosive power, if thrown against the tracks. Advice was to lie still rather than run and wait <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> past, to be engaged by artillery of at least [...] calibre firing at close range. Passive defences such as road obstacles were suggested but not anti-tank ditches or mines.|$|E

2500|$|Opeth {{were signed}} by Candlelight without a demo. <b>For</b> <b>them,</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{into the studio}} to record a demo was as big a step as going in to record an album.

[...] Åkerfeldt had sent out {{rehearsal}} tapes to several labels, but never received a reply. But the band received an offer from Lee Barrett to record an album. Åkerfeldt found it [...] "quite weird". Anders Nyström (of Katatonia) said Candlelight was interested, based on a rumor from Samoth (of Emperor). Samoth had sent out a tape of unsigned bands to Barrett at Candlelight. It only had a few seconds of [...] "The Apostle in Triumph". Barrett liked it so much he wanted to sign the band.

2500|$|For many years, {{neither the}} Nyasaland {{government}} nor British government {{had dealt with}} African land grievances, despite recognising that a problem existed: generally, the supposed needs of the estate owners were given priority. Thangata was regulated by the Natives on Private Estates Ordinance 1928: however, this allowed landowners to evict up to 10% of residents at five-yearly intervals. It did not provide a permanent solution, as it did not {{deal with the problem}} of estate land that was under-utilised but not available to African farmers, nor with the owners' ability to evict tenants. The legislation was overtly race-based, as used the category of [...] "Native" [...] (or African) to determine land rights. There were no large-scale evictions in 1933 and few in 1938, but in 1943 hundreds of families in the Blantyre District refused to leave their tenancies as there was nowhere <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to, and the colonial authorities declined to use force.
