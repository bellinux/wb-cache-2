5|$|I did it {{deliberately}} {{and with}} all my power, because I felt that by nothing but the sacrifice of human life would the nation be brought to realise the horrible torture our women face! If I had succeeded <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> forcible feeding could not in all conscience have been resorted to again.|$|E
5|$|I am {{completely}} {{at a loss}} in attempting to fathom the reasons why certain individuals and certain groups have now started a letter-writing campaign … to defeat the act. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> if the letter writers would consult the facts, they would join with all others not only in hoping this act would become law but in working for its speedy passage and approval.|$|E
5|$|I am {{at first}} {{inclined}} to agree... But on re-reading the whole Ode, this line {{strikes me as}} a serious blemish on a beautiful poem, and the reason must be either that I fail to understand it, or that it is a statement which is untrue. And I suppose that Keats meant something by it, however remote his truth and his beauty may have been from these words in ordinary use. And <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> he would have repudiated any explanation of the line which called it a pseudo-statement... The statement of Keats seems to me meaningless: or perhaps {{the fact that it is}} grammatically meaningless conceals another meaning from me.|$|E
60|$|Bib. No, rather {{describe}} your own little money; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that's</b> so little {{it is not}} visible.|$|R
6000|$|... "But it does content me," [...] said Lynde imperiously. [...] "I want no other--I wish {{this life}} {{to go on}} forever--forever, do you understand? If <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> it would--if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> no change would ever come to me, <b>I</b> would <b>be</b> {{perfectly}} content. It is the fear that a change will come that makes me wretched. Oh!" [...] She shuddered and put {{her hands over her}} eyes.|$|R
60|$|I came on doggedly, saving my strength. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> must {{catch him}} at last, {{it did not}} matter when.|$|R
25|$|Oh <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> {{there are}} Hamas {{members on the}} UNRWA payroll and I don't {{see that as a}} crime. Hamas as a {{political}} organization does not mean that every member is a militant and we do not do political vetting and exclude people from one persuasion as against another.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> she was {{frequently}} bewildered by the rapidity and mutability {{of her own}} impulses. Possessed, as she was, of an intuitive rather than an analytical intelligence, I doubt that she really understood herself clearly, any more than did {{most of those who}} thought they knew her intimately. An exception in this regard was Daphne du Maurier.|$|E
25|$|I {{suspect that}} I know {{more of the}} English class than any man in Britain. I never kept any reckoning: but I know that one year with another? — and less of late years than in earlier time? — I have talked to more than five in each year, giving {{more than a hundred}} and fifty specimens. Of this <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>that</b> it is my own fault if they have not been a thousand. Nobody knows how they swarm, except those to whom they {{naturally}} resort. They are in all ranks and occupations, of all ages and characters. They are very earnest people, and their purpose is bona fide, the dissemination of their paradoxes. A great many — the mass, indeed — are illiterate, and a great many waste their means, and are in or approaching penury. These discoverers despise one another.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Exactly,' said Captain Armine; 'I would willingly {{this instant}} become a flower, if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> Miss Temple would cherish my existence.' ...|$|R
60|$|I thanked my good aunt, in my heart, for her {{tenderness}} towards my wife; and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> {{she knew}} <b>I</b> did.|$|R
6000|$|LADY CHILTERN. You see now, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>that</b> {{for many}} reasons any further {{acquaintance}} between us during your stay in London is quite impossible? ...|$|R
500|$|Many {{publications}} in Russian media {{suggested that the}} death of Litvinenko was connected to Boris Berezovsky. [...] Former FSB chief Nikolay Kovalyov, for whom Litvinenko worked, said that the incident [...] "looks like [...] hand of Berezovsky. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> no kind of intelligence services participated." [...] This involvement of Berezovsky was alleged by numerous Russian television shows.|$|E
500|$|Instead, Walpole {{wrote to}} Mason to say: [...] "The Churchyard was, I am persuaded, {{posterior}} to West's death {{at least three}} or four years, {{as you will see}} by my note. At least <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> I had the twelve or more first lines from himself above three years after that period, and it was long before he finished it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "A small obscure {{magazine}} published, I think, in Hull and called, would hon. Members believe, Lobster makes {{a practice}} of publishing names of gentlemen who are alleged {{to be members of}} the security services. That creates danger and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> my right hon. Friend the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup shares my deep apprehension about that sort of practice being allowed to continue." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hurt somewhat, I see, but not badly, <b>I</b> hope. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> {{you would}} not have been taken prisoner, unless you had been injured." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"Then <b>I</b> {{should not}} <b>be</b> in haste {{to show them}} those ways," [...] said Pertinax, [...] "till <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> Rome could not save the Wall." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's not right, I tell you," [...] little Hanover said; {{and from}} his tone <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> he had already said it a number of times.|$|R
500|$|Kinsler, {{who would}} have been {{eligible}} to play for Israel in the 2013 World Baseball Classic because of his Jewish heritage, said: [...] "Wow, I would be happy to play for Team Israel.... The truth is that if a proposal comes from Team USA to play for them, I will have a very difficult decision to make. Youk , Braun , and I could make a fantastic team. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> I'll talk it over with Youk – we always laugh about things like this." ...|$|E
500|$|Dvoretsky comments: Here, {{we should}} touch on one {{delicate}} question. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> this unique endgame position was discovered {{with the help}} of Thompson’s famous computer database. Is this a 'flaw,' diminishing the composer's achievement? [...] Yes, the computer database is an instrument, available to anyone nowadays. Out of it, no doubt, we could probably extract yet more unique positions – there are some chess composers who do so regularly. The standard for evaluation here should be the result achieved. Thus: miracles, based upon complex computer analysis rather than on their content of sharp ideas, are probably of interest only to certain aesthetes.|$|E
500|$|In 1906 O. C. Simonds a {{well-known}} prairie school landscape architect was hired, he simplified the road system, planned walks and planting areas. It was Sidmons who first described this area around West Circle Drive as a [...] "sacred space" [...] and who reaffirmed {{the idea of}} as area of campus as a park {{to be protected from}} development. In a 1906 letter to the Board for Trustee's [...] "This area is, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure,</b> <b>that</b> feature of the College which is most pleasantly and affectionately remembered by the students after they leave their Alma Mater, and I doubt if any instruction given has a greater effect upon their lives." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, daily. He is {{so anxious}} to see you, Mr. Neville, and so much obliged to you for coming. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> you would come." ...|$|R
60|$|Still <b>I</b> <b>was</b> troubled {{about this}} matter, {{for some of}} these priests were very fierce and intolerant, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> in time they would push the {{business}} further.|$|R
60|$|As their pace <b>was</b> leisurely, <b>I</b> {{determined}} {{to follow them}} until I came again within range, as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> they would stop and feed in a short time.|$|R
500|$|The game {{levels were}} {{developed}} {{on a level}} editor on the PlayStation Portable, but Zoë Mode {{were not able to}} refine the editor in time for shipping. [...] Mottram said [...] "It would be great to see user generated content and this is something we have been seriously thinking about for the future" [...] and that downloadable content [...] "would work perfectly with the Crush level structure and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> fans of the game would be eager to see more levels." [...] Mottram has stated they would like to market a sequel based on the highly positive feedback they had received; however, with other Zoë Mode projects such as SingStar and Play taking precedence, he does not know when this could be.|$|E
500|$|For {{this version}} {{he also made}} changes to the Emir's letter to Tintin; the former version had been formal in its prose, stating [...] "Most esteemed and well-beloved friend, I entrust to you my son Abdullah, to improve his English. Here the {{situation}} is serious. Should any misfortune befall me I count on you, my friend, to care for Abdullah". In Hergé's revised edition, he adopts a more florid prose style: [...] "This is to tell you, oh highly esteemed friend, that I entrust to you Abdullah, my adored son. Because here the situation is serious. Should misfortune descend on me like the hawk on an innocent gazelle (for the world is made of life and death) <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> Abdullah will find you with warmth and affection, refuge and peace. And in doing this you will be performing a fragrant act before Allah." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{critics of}} Lukashenko, {{including}} the opposition group Zubr, {{use the term}} Lukashism {{to refer to the}} political and economic system Lukashenko has implemented in Belarus. The term is also used more broadly to refer to an authoritarian ideology based on a cult of his personality and nostalgia for Soviet times among certain groups in Belarus. [...] The US Congress sought to aid the opposition groups by passing the Belarus Democracy Act of 2004 to introduce sanctions against Lukashenko's government and provide financial and other support to the opposition. Lukashenko supporters argue that his rule spared Belarus the turmoil that beset many other former Soviet countries. Lukashenko commented on the criticism of him by saying: [...] "I've been hearing these accusations for over 10years and we have got used to it. We are not going to answer them. I want to come from the premise that the elections in Belarus are held for ourselves. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> it is the Belarusian people who are the masters in our state." ...|$|E
60|$|He spoke always of the £300 {{a year as}} if it were a certainty, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> in case of his marrying me {{his mother}} would at once stop it.|$|R
60|$|I promised. I {{would have}} promised {{anything}} {{in my power to}} make her dying pillow easier. Besides, what did it matter? <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> Hugh would never think of me again.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> we <b>were</b> doing right. And {{yet what}} else can we do? Well, then, Ida, the die is cast, and we will call upon Mrs. Westmacott tomorrow." ...|$|R
500|$|Tatlock {{struggled}} with her sexuality, {{at one point}} writing to a friend that [...] "there was a period when I thought I was homosexual. I still am, in a way, forced to believe it, but really, logically, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> I can't be because of my un-masculinity." [...] She began seeing Robert Oppenheimer in 1936, {{when she was a}} graduate student there and Oppenheimer was a professor of physics at Berkeley. They met through his landlady, Mary Ellen Washburn, who was {{also a member of the}} Communist party, when Washburn held a fund raiser for communist-backed Spanish Republicans. The couple started dating and had a passionate relationship; he proposed to her twice, but she refused. She is credited with introducing Oppenheimer to radical politics during the late 1930s, and to people involved with, or sympathetic to the Communist Party or related groups, such as Rudy Lambert and Thomas Addis. They continued seeing each other after he became involved with Kitty Harrison, whom he married on November 1, 1940. Oppenheimer and Tatlock [...] spent the New Year together in 1941, and once met at Mark Hopkins hotel in San Francisco.|$|E
500|$|Historian Jim Handy {{described}} Árbenz's {{economic and}} political ideals as [...] "decidedly pragmatic and capitalist in temper". According to historian Stephen Schlesinger, while Árbenz did have a few communists in lower-level positions in his administration, he [...] "was not a dictator, {{he was not a}} crypto-communist". Schlesinger described him as a democratic socialist. Nevertheless, some of his policies, particularly those involving agrarian reform, would be branded as [...] "communist" [...] by the Guatemalan upper class and the United Fruit Company. Historian Piero Gleijeses has argued that although Árbenz's policies were intentionally capitalist in nature, his personal views gradually shifted towards communism. A goal of Árbenz was to increase Guatemala's {{economic and political}} independence. He believed that to do this Guatemala needed to build a strong domestic economy. He made an effort {{to reach out to the}} indigenous Mayan people, and sent government representatives to confer with them. From this effort he learned that the Maya held strongly to their ideals of dignity and self-determination; inspired in part by this, he stated in 1951 that [...] "If the independence and prosperity of our people were incompatible, which for certain they are not, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> the great majority of Guatemalans would prefer to be a poor nation, but free, and not a rich colony, but enslaved." ...|$|E
500|$|Of Grainger the pianist, The New York Times critic Harold Schonberg {{wrote that}} his unique style was [...] {{expressed}} with [...] "amazing skill, personality and vigor". [...] The early enthusiasm which had greeted his concert appearances became muted in later years, and reviews of his performances {{during the final}} ten {{years of his life}} were often harsh. [...] However, Britten regarded Grainger's late recording of the Grieg concerto, from a live performance at Aarhus in 1957, as [...] "one of the noblest ever committed to record" [...] – despite the suppression of the disc for many years, because of the proliferation of wrong notes and other faults. [...] Brian Allison from the Grainger Museum, referring to Grainger's early displays of artistic skills, has speculated that had John Grainger's influence not been removed, [...] "Percy Aldridge Grainger may today be remembered as one of Australia's leading painters and designers, who just happened to have a latent talent as a pianist and composer". The ethnomusicologist John Blacking, while acknowledging Grainger's contribution to social and cultural aspects of music, nevertheless writes that if the continental foundation of Grainger's musical education had not been [...] "undermined by dilettantism and the disastrous influence of his mother, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> his ultimate contribution to the world of music would have been much greater".|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps not {{so easily}} as I seem," [...] he whispered, leaning a little forward in his place. [...] "If only <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> you <b>were</b> {{not in love with}} Jocelyn Thew!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An uncomfortable solution; for, {{since that}} baneful man did but just now anew drop on me his bane, how shall <b>I</b> <b>be</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> my present {{exemption}} from its effects will be lasting?" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{raised her}} eyes. It seemed to me, who was {{watching}} her closely, that she shrank a little back in her seat. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> she shared my instinctive dislike of the man.|$|R
