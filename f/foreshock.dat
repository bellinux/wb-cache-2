After theoretical consideration we conclude: 1) Taking into account the number rate of SA <b>foreshocks,</b> their amplitude and frequency range, they emit due to opening of fractures with size of L = 70 - 200 m (M = 1 - 2); 2) The electro-kinetic effect is the most promising mechanism of ULF <b>foreshocks,</b> but it is efficient only if two special conditions are fulfilled: a) origin of fractures near fluid-saturated places or liquid reservoirs (aquifers); b) appearance of open porosity or initiation of percolation instability; 3) Both SA and ULF magnetic field pulses are related to near-distant fractures (r < 20 - 30 km); 4) Taking into account number rate and activation period of seismic, SA and ULF <b>foreshocks,</b> it is rather probable that opening of fractures and rupture of fluid reservoirs occur in the large preparation area with horizontal size about 100 - 200 km...|$|R

The earthquake occurred on 9March2005 at DRDGOLD's Hartebeesfontein mine in Stilfontein, killing two miners underground and resulting in the closure of the mine. An investigation by the mining regulator following the incident found that it was caused by mining and further seismic events would occur while mining continued. The report on the investigation recommended improvements in seismic monitoring among other things, and some of the recommendations had been implemented before the 2014 earthquake.

40|$|For a decade, the U. S.

During this time, we have learned much about the seismogenic process at Parkfield, about the long-term probability of the Parkfield mainshock, and about the estimation of these types of probabilities. The probabilities for potential <b>foreshocks</b> at Parkfield are reexamined and revised in light of these advances. As part of this process, we have confirmed both the rate of <b>foreshocks</b> before strike-slip earthquakes in the San Andreas physiographic province and the uniform distribution of <b>foreshocks</b> with magnitude proposed by earlier studies. Compared to the earlier assessment, these new estimates of the long-term probability of the Parkfield mainshock are lower, our estimate of the rate of background seismicity is higher, and we find that the assumption that <b>foreshocks</b> at Parkfield occur in a unique way is not statistically significant at the 95 % confidence level. While the exact numbers vary depending on the assumptions that are made, the new alert probabilities are lower than previously estimated. Considering the various assumptions and the statistical uncertainties in the input parameters, we also compute a plausible range for the probabilities. The range is large, partly due to the extra knowledge that exists for the Parkfield segment, making us question the usefulness of these numbers...|$|R

Preceding this Mw 9.0 earthquake, an MJMA 7.3 earthquake occurred on March 9. This earthquake and its aftershocks can be regarded as <b>foreshocks</b> to the Mw 9.0 event. Since large earthquakes are likely to produce stress concentrations in neighboring regions along the plate boundary, the mainshock might have been triggered by this sequence of <b>foreshocks</b> and this mainshock have caused aftershocks.

Since the activity of the <b>foreshocks</b> was significantly different on the trenchward and landward sides of the hypocenter of the mainshock, the difference can be interpreted in terms of the differences in the structure above the plate boundary. On the trenchward side of the mainshock hypocenter, where most of the <b>foreshocks</b> occurred, the shallow dipping subducting Pacific slab contacts the continental crustal layer (slab-crust contact zone).
