40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} effect of winter and spring sowing on yield and plant traits of safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) cultivars under Tekirdağ conditions. This research was conducted at Applying Research Field, Faculty of Agriculture University of Namık Kemal in 2006 - 2007. Fourteen safflower cultivars were used in this study. The research was conducted using a randomized complete block, split plot design with three replicates. Different sowing time significantly affected some agronomic characters of the genotypes used in this study. There was interaction between genotypes and sowing times. According to the results of this research; Yenice <b>has</b> <b>showed</b> the tallest values in winter sowing 207. 5 cm for plant height, Montola 2000 <b>has</b> <b>showed</b> the smallest values in spring sowing 55. 2 cm for plant height.
