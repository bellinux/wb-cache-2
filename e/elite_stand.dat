Leading members of academic circles and the formation of the group of their professorial <b>elite</b> <b>stand</b> at the centre of attention. The history of this group of members of the academic community is followed against the background of confessional changes in the sixteenth century, the rise of humanism at the university, and the formation of educational programs in connection with the influence of European university education and domestic, primarily religious-political, development. In this context the study characterises the development of Krakow university education from the second half of the sixteenth century as a period of certain crisis, accompanied by a decline in foreign students and characterised in relation to the university elite by their conservatism, traditionalism and gradual concentration on students from the immediate surrounding region...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} compare the {{reactions}} of two states {{to the process of}} globalization: (1) Barbados and (2) Trinidad and Tobago. The major contention is that state reaction to the process of globalization is not necessarily in defense of the population who elect govern-ments to office, but rather their response is dependent on the type of economic elites within the nation-state, {{and the extent to which}} the social formation allows national elites to couch their interest in nationalist terms. The major hypothesis advanced is that the more the economic elites stand to benefit from the process of globalization, the more they will urge the state to push ahead with the process of globalization, even if it has negative consequences for the population. On the other hand, the more the economic <b>elite</b> <b>stand</b> to lose in terms of material well-being, the more they will urge the state to resist the process, making their argument in nationalist terms. This diminishes the state’s ability to transform the society and reduce inequality. A combination of content analysis of the major daily newspapers in each country in 2002 as well as interviews with key informants provides the data for this study...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Stand up paddle {{boarding}} (SUP) is {{a rapidly}} growing sport and recreational activity where anecdotal evidence exists for its proposed fitness, injury rehabilitation & core strength benefits. A {{review of the literature}} failed to identify a single article which examined the potential physiological adaptations associated with SUP. Aims: The {{purpose of this study was}} to profile <b>elite</b> <b>stand</b> up paddle boarders in relation to balance, muscular strength and muscular endurance. Methods: Eight elite SUP’s were recruited from the Stand Up Paddle Surfing Association of Australia. Anatomical measures of multifidus cross-sectional area (via ultrasound), postural control under static and dynamic conditions and an isometric test of lumbar extension were performed. Results: Results found no significant differences in height, significantly less mass (p = 0. 001) and significantly lower BMI (p < 0. 05) than published Australian Bureau of Statistics data. Significantly lower static postural control indicated by increased velocity of sway ((p < 0. 01), Eyes Open (EO) = + 72. 02 % Eyes Closed (EC) = + 76. 34 %) and significantly higher levels of dynamic postural control indicated by decreased velocity of sway (p < 0. 01, Eyes-Open-Anterior-Posterior instability condition (EOAP) - 34. 54 %, Eyes –Closed-Anterior-Posterior instability condition (ECAP) - 35. 83 %, Eyes Open Medial Lateral instability condition (EOML) - 16. 91 %, Eyes Closed Medial Lateral instability condition (ECML) - 10. 42 %) were recorded in all but one condition when compared to national level surfers, which we attributed to time spent in the standing position on an unstable surface. Conclusion: These results indicate that stand up paddle boarding may indeed be beneficial for strength and endurance training of the trunk musculature, for balance training for other sports and useful as a rehabilitation tool for musculoskeletal dysfunction...|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: pages 164 - 177. This {{dissertation}} {{is primarily}} concerned with {{the functioning of the}} law in the Cape Colony in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries as it pertained to slaves and masters (and to a lesser extent Khoi servants). It examines the operation of the law in one particular rural district, namely, Stellenbosch in the years c. 1760 - 1820. The chief primary sources include criminal [...] and on a smaller scale civil [...] records of the local and central courts of the colony. Travellers' accounts have also been utilised. The study of one particular rural district reveals {{the extent to which the}} law was intricately woven into the fabric of the settler 'community'. Despite differentials of wealth, the settlers in Stellenbosch district were essentially part of a community of slaveholders. The contours of the settler community fundamentally influenced every step of the legal process. Members of the settler community were in a situation of face-to-face interaction. This meant that often, in conflicts between settlers, recourse to the law was seen as a last resort and mo. re emphasis was placed on the maintenance of personal social relationships. However, this community, of which a landed <b>elite</b> <b>stood</b> in the forefront, had discordant features and domination of the poor by the rich did not go without any struggle. The features of the settler community also fundamentally influenced the position of slaves in the law. Access to the courts for the slaves for complaints against their masters was very significantly determined by conflicts which existed amongst slaveholders. In court the extent of solidarity amongst members of the community could ultimately determine the chances of success for slaves. Another way in which concerns of community influenced the legal process was by the importance which was attached to the reputations of individual slaveowners. Often such concerns overrode strictly legal ones. Even in determining the severity of sentences in criminal cases reputations of individuals were of primary importance. The VOC not only served to bolster the authority of slaveowners but also to keep the wider society in control. Therefore, it could not allow slaveholder tyranny over their labourers to go unchecked. Moreover, the legal system had to be more than simply an instrument in the hands of the master class. At the local level, the VOC could be seen to be acting in the interests of the wider society by listening to the complaints of slaves and prosecuting individual masters. Roman common law, as opposed to statutory law, was the law most commonly used in criminal cases involving slaves. This had two important implications. Firstly, Roman law did not deny the slave any personality and prosecutors constantly reminded slaveowners that slaves were persons. Secondly, Roman law had an apparent universality in that its dictates were made applicable to all in society. These factors combined to make the law perform a hegemonic function...|$|R

50|$|Vernadsky {{became the}} leading American {{exponent}} of depicting Russia as much Asian and European, {{if not more}} so. He pointed out many strong cultural differences between Russia and Europe, and praised the success of Russian development along an independent path that revealed his own unique character. Vernadsky was a geographical determinist like his Yale colleague Ellsworth Huntington. They assumed that {{the characteristics of a}} land defined the character of the people and indeed of their government as well. For that reason Vernadsky was able to identify the roots of Russian culture in an ancient period long before the Slavic groups arrived. He thereby undercut the standard claim that modern Russia emerged from Kievan Rus. He emphasized the importance of the Mongol period (1238-1471), as the horde united the vast Eurasian plain under a single ruler. This gave tsarist Russia a strong centralized government as well as the deep distrust of Europe. Vernadsky was annoyed that Peter the Great tried to Westernize Russia, thereby distorting its natural character. He said Peter only succeeded in polarizing Russia into a Western oriented <b>elite</b> that <b>stood</b> in profound conflict with the Eurasian peasants. Indeed, Vernadsky argued that this polarization {{was one of the main}} weaknesses of the tsarist regime, making it incapable of dealing with the revolutionary movements of the early twentieth century. He celebrated the collapse of the European style parliamentary regime in the October Revolution of 1917 that brought the Bolsheviks to power. Vernadsky was not a liberal, nor was he a Communist sympathizer, but he did admire the Bolsheviks for rebuilding a strong Russia on non-European lines.|$|R

50|$|According to the {{mid-twentieth century}} historian, author and preservationist, Mary Wingfield Scott, the Court End District dates to the 1780s, and grew {{naturally}} as a prestigious neighborhood due to its close proximity to Thomas Jefferson’s new Capitol. Before its heyday as the neighborhood of Richmond’s <b>elite,</b> there once <b>stood</b> a vibrant theater district and a large scale market. The great theater fire of 1811 destroyed most of the “Theater Block,” and the market failed {{to compete with the}} better established Old State Market or “First Market” in nearby Shockoe Bottom. The neighborhood grew in waves, primarily in the 1780s, 1810s, and 1840s. The Court End was the home of large number of Richmond’s important houses of worship, including First Presbyterian, First Baptist, St. Paul’s Episcopal, First African Baptist, Monumental, and Sycamore Churches, St. Peter’s Cathedral, and Beth Shalome and Beth Ahabah Synagogues. The Richmond Female Institute, or Baptist Women’s Institute, was located {{in the heart of the}} Court End. It later formed Westmoreland College, which in turn, became the women’s school within the University of Richmond. Its nineteenth century building towered over and dominated the Court End cityscape.

This army marched to San Miguel, today San Miguel de Allende, and then onto the city of Guanajuato. Just on the {{outskirts}} on 28 September 1810, Hidalgo sent a warning letter to city authorities, but it was ignored. Instead, royalist troops and many of the <b>elite</b> made their <b>stand</b> at the Alhóndiga de Granaditas granary, an imposing building with few windows and thick walls. After entering the city unopposed, Hidalgo decided to attack the granary. This was the first battle against Spanish troops in the war and is popularly called the 'Siege of the Alhondiga'. The insurgents were unable to take the heavily defended building as royalist gunfire kept them from approaching the only entrance until a miner by the name of Juan José de los Reyes Martínez, better known as El Pípila, brilliantly strapped a large flat stone onto his back for protection. Crawling, he carried a flask of tar and a torch. When he reached the wooden doors of the main entrance, he smeared it with the tar and set it on fire. This allowed the insurgents to penetrate the building, defeat the Spanish royalist army and elite, and take over the heavily fortified and defended building. This action is commemorated by a colossal statue of Pipila on a hill overlooking the city.|$|R

Furthermore, there is a persistent threat that racist socio-political movements will arise and establish themselves, introducing a “racist agenda,” pressuring established parties to shift their position, and blocking or reversing institutional re-alignment in favor of pluralism, equality, and justice. It is paradoxical that established <b>elites</b> within Europe <b>stand</b> for increased pluralism and opposition to xenophobia and racism, but {{that they have been}} largely unable to prevent or limit socio- political movements articulating ethno-nationalism (implying an ardent xenophobia), and authoritarian views on socio-cultural matters (e. g. law-and-order). Nor have they been able to overcome much of the institutional inertia and resistance in order to effectively address the problems of widespread institutionalized discrimination. These notes identify in Section I normal group and community processes that lie at the root of xenophobia and racism, and related forms of negative response to diverse “others” – “otherisms” is the term we have coined. Our main point is that problems of xenophobia and otherism, including racism, are particular radical expressions or forms processes taking place in all social groups and communities, but, of course, taking different forms and having different consequences. 4 By undesrstanding these basic processes, we can better analyze and most effectively address problems of racism and xenophobia.

From the other side, there is an opinion of medieval elites from Romanic artistic reality, arising from Romanic experience, from the "world of Romanic art", based on coexistence with Romanic art work, with its reality, its achievements, {{as well as its}} place and purpose in the life of social elites of Istria.

50|$|A third {{counter-narrative}} {{might be}} seen in the above-mentioned replacement of the Rabbi's picture with one of Stalin. Seekers of happiness was released in 1936 shortly before the beginning of the Great Purge in which the entire political elite of the JAO was decimated. However, purges where already happening in the beginning of 1936 on a smaller scale. The Rabbi in the frame hanging over the bed is presumably Rabbi Israel Meir HaCohen Kagan a.k.a. the “Chofetz Chaim”, a famous Polish Rabbi of the 19th century. “Chofetz Chaim” translates “Seeker of live”. In his main work “Sefer Chofetz Chaim” he deals with the problem of “Lashon Hara”, the term for derogatory speech about another person which is severely forbidden in Jewish law, even then when what is said is true. The subject matter of Lashon Hara has several reference points in the plot of the film. Firstly, of course, the constant complains about Pinya's attitude. Secondly, the mourning scene stands {{in the context of the}} falsely accused Korney. The fact that the Rabbi's picture is hanging over the bed is confusing in as much as Dvoira had already accepted Natan as an advisor substituting for the advisory function of the Rabbi in the shtetl earlier in the movie. The persistence of the Rabbi's presence might signify Dvoira's not yet completely overcome religious belief. But it might as well, for those educated in Jewish tradition, comment on the atmosphere of denunciation in the Stalinist era. The replacement of the Rabbi's picture by one of Stalin might then not signify solely a process of secularization based on functional substitution, but puts Natan as the one structurally holding the Rabbi's place in contrast to Stalin. The film can then be read as aesthetically foreshadowing the purge of the Jewish <b>elite</b> which Natan <b>stands</b> for.In all three examples the understanding of the suggested counter-narratives is based on the condition that the viewer is educated in Jewish religion or culture: biblical knowledge in the first, Hebrew reading literacy in the second, and knowledge of Jewish law in the third. The film undermines censorship by unfolding the critical message by means of esoteric signs only readable for the Jewish audience.|$|R
40|$|When Christian Hebraists reprinted Jewish polemical works {{they served}} as 2 ̆ 2 Spokesmen for Judaism 2 ̆ 2 in two {{different}} ways. While {{it is true that}} Christian Hebraists did report authentically Jewish opinion when they ppblished Jewish polemical texts or excerpts from them, they did so in ways, which reflected Christian standards and expectations. All of the scholars who served as editors and translators of medieval Jewish polemics were university professors, who were obligated by law, oath and conscience to defend the Christian confession of the state, which supported their university. They were sometimes required to enforce the censorship ordinance of their locality as well. An improperly censored book could result in political embarrassment for the state in question, and unpleasant consequences for the censor, particularly where Jewish books were concerned. The frequent reprinting of the twenty-three questions demonstrates that Hebraists were allowed to publish fairly abrasive comments by Jewish authors, provided that a refutation followed them. However, as P. T. van Rooden has pointed out, the publication of some texts, notably the Nizzahon of R. Lipmann Mülhausen, was unacceptable in Latin or another language that Christian readers could readily understand. In the mid-seventeenth century, Hackspann, and his contemporaries Constantijn L 2 ̆ 7 Empereur and Johannes Buxtorf the Younger worried, with good reason, that Christian radicals might make use of Latin translations of Jewish polemical texts. The reception of Jewish medieval polemical texts by Reformation era Christian Hebraists is indicative of several overall trends within Christian Hebraism as an intellectual movement. Only {{a relatively small number of}} Hebraists were capable of reading and understanding Hebrew texts apart from the Bible or medieval biblical commentaries, much less to translate such texts into Latin. This handful of Christian Hebraists formed an <b>elite</b> group, which <b>stands</b> out from the roughly 350 authors, editors and translators of Hebraica who published Hebraica books during this period. As with the Christian Hebraists who studied and responded to Jewish polemical works, only a relatively small group of Christian Hebraists was responsible for mediating Jewish linguistic and biblical scholarship, kabbalistic texts, historical books, and philosophical works for a primarily Latin reading audience. One of the most urgent tasks in the study of Christian Hebraism is to analyze their role as 2 ̆ 2 mediators of Jewish learning. 2 ̆ 2 The texts that they sought to make available to Christian readers were carefully selected and supported Christian interests. If these Christian Hebraists were 2 ̆ 2 spokesmen for Judaism, 2 ̆ 2 it was only to the extent that their Jewish texts contributed in some way to Christian needs...|$|R
