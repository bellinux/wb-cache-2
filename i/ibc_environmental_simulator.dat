40|$|We {{present a}} kind of {{agent-based}} simulation being a refinement of discrete-event simulation. It has a formal semantic for execution, which bases on object-based simulation, which itself is basing on discrete-event simulation. Our agent-based simulation contains distribution of the simulated system in active entities (agents) and passive entities (objects). Agents have an external (physical) {{as well as an}} internal (mental) state. In simulation there is an <b>environmental</b> <b>simulator,</b> managing the environment, which is the objects and the external agent states. We also have an agent simulator for each agent, managing the internal agent state. Simulation cycles, whereby the <b>environmental</b> <b>simulator</b> computes the events for the current cycle, does changes in the environment and sends perceptions to each agent simulator. Agent simulators compute internal events for the current cycle, do changes to the internal state and send taken actions to the <b>environmental</b> <b>simulator.</b> Agent-based simulation bases on object-based simulation, which itself bases on discrete-event simulation. One can transform an agent-based simulation model into an equivalent object-based model, which one can transform into an equivalent discrete-event simulation model. So, agent-based simulation is indeed a refinement of discrete-event simulation. We present a UML-based specification language to specify a concrete agent-based simulation system visually. This language uses reaction rules to specify the behaviour of simulation. We present an AORML-based specification language as well, which allows more naturally modelling, but is not useable for automatically processing because of insufficient tool support. We use the example of Automatically Guided Vehicles intensively, because it is very suitable to demonstrate agent-based simulation. Further examples are elevator systems and queues in supermarkets. As proof of concept we implemented a simulation system, whose kernel is a Java program library. We used this system to simulate a complex system of Automatically Guided Vehicles with decentral control and to do studies on the efficiency of this system. Having a simulation system, which is visually modelled using the UML-based simulation language, one can generate a simulation model in the XML-based language XMI. Using XSL transformation this model can be transformed into Java code, which can be used by the simulator. So, we developed a system to transform a visually specified simulation model into a simulation program, which can be executed by the simulator...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The lunar {{exploration}} {{project of}} China is underway, and a lunar rover {{will be developed}} and launched onto the lunar surface in the next step. In order to verify the reliability and diverse functions (such as landing impact, autonomous navigation and tele-operation) of the rover, an experimental facility for the lunar rover development is needed. Based on {{the knowledge of the}} lunar surface environment and the existing simulation technology, this paper presents an idea for realization of an integrated experimental facility for the lunar rover development. It is well known that the lunar environment is very tough and the moon geological feature is complicated too. A kind of knockdown simulator for lunar surface environment is suggested. The main part will include various mobile units, each of which simulate a kind of lunar surface topography in different dimension, such as craters, hills, and ravines. One unit is one grid, which is a sand table in small size, but the sand is a sort of man-made lunar soil simulant, which has similar chemical composition, particle size distribution, and engineering properties to the true lunar sample. According to the request of the one kind of test, corresponding units or grids are selected and assembled to be a test bed, which dynamically achieves the simulation of different terrain on the lunar surface in a limited area. At the same time, a relative fewer units can be chosen to assemble a smaller test bed, which can cooperate with other existing <b>environmental</b> <b>simulators</b> (for example, vacuum container, dropping tower) to fulfill an integrated <b>environmental</b> <b>simulator...</b>|$|R

40|$|Functional {{analysis}} and Monte Carlo simulation {{were used to}} quantify uncertainties in model simulation of pollution behaviour and effects. The first-order part of the functional analysis method provides a measure of uncertainties in dependent variables in terms of uncertainties in independent variables. The procedure is based on first-order terms in the Taylor series expansion of the dependent variable about its mean value with respect {{to one or more}} independent variables. The major assumption is that all independent and dependent variables are the second moment variables (SMV), which means that the behaviour of any SMV is completely described by its mean and standard deviation. The mathematical simplicity of the procedure allows application by simple input-output models. Consequently, it has been applied to many <b>environmental</b> <b>simulators,</b> e. g. hydrological models, stream water quality models, lake water quality models and ground water pollution models.

40|$|Land surface models (LSMs) are {{prospective}} {{starting points}} {{to develop a}} global hyper-resolution model of the terrestrial water, energy, and biogeochemical cycles. However, there are some fundamental limitations of LSMs related to how meaningfully hydrological fluxes and stores are represented. A diagnostic approach to model evaluation and improvement is taken here that exploits hydrological expert knowledge to detect LSM inadequacies through consideration of the major behavioural functions of a hydrological system: overall water balance, vertical water redistribution in the unsaturated zone, temporal water redistribution, and spatial water redistribution over the catchment's groundwater and surface-water systems. Three types of information are utilized to improve the model's hydrology: (a)  observations, (b)  information about expected response from regionalized data, and (c)  information from an independent physics-based model.

40|$|ABSTRACT: It is {{well known}} that {{short-term}} loadings caused by earthquakes, explosions, skiers etc. can trigger avalanches. There are some models of similar influence on snow stability. One of them ties a loss of snow stability with a possible shear strength decreasing at short-term loading. This work concerns experimental studies of the phenomenon. The experiments were carried out at the Cryospheric <b>Environmental</b> <b>Simulator</b> of the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (Japan) and at the field station of the Center for Avalanche Safety of “Apatit ” JSC in the Khibini Mountains (Russia). The majority of the experiments were carried out with a specially made shaking table. Shear force and snow sample accelerations were registered with high frequency gages. In some cases shear deformation was also measured. In total more than one hundred experiments have been carried out. It was found that at high rate loading, snow shear strength is significantly less than at low rate ones. Comparison of this effect for different rates of loading and different types of snow has been done. Obtained experimental results and their possible application for snow stability assessment are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Every {{architectural}} design consists of spaces and series of successive spaces. The {{way in which}} spaces are arranged to form a series can only be experienced by passing through them. This means that movement plays {{a very important role}} in the experience of our spatial environment. At the same time, this presents a major challenge to architects, and especially to students in architecture, who need to take into consideration how their designs are experienced in movement. Therefore, at the Department of Architecture in Tampere one of our aims in Architectural Design is to teach our students to see the spaces, masses, houses and housing areas they design {{from the point of view}} of movement. This training has mainly been provided in the context of a Basic Course and Professional Course I in Architectural Design and the related course on Time and Motion in Architecture.

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} {{challenge}} that is unique to sensor network simulations, that of integrating environment and network simulators. The content and {{the characteristics of the}} data being sensed {{play a vital role in}} the performance of various algorithms and protocols that have been proposed by the research community. This point has been emphasized in numerous literatures that have been published in the context of wireless sensor networks research. Yet the range of simulators that have been targeted towards this new field of research concentrate primarily in simulating the network characteristics, such as the wireless channel the nodes themselves and various topological scenarios for the node, although some simulators such as TOSSIM [9] and EmStar [14] do provide simulation of interfaces on the nodes to feed data into the network. The simulation of the behavior of the network in the presence of the data that is being sensed has not received considerable attention. In order to breach this gap we need to integrate network and environment simulators. The purpose of this work is to first present a survey of the existing network <b>simulators</b> and <b>environmental</b> <b>simulators,</b> to highlight the deficiency in the current research based on simulations. Further we present a case study on integrating a specific network simulator (TOSSIM [9]) with a structural simulator (MATLAB structural control tool box), to present the general challenges that might exist when such integrations are performed.

40|$|When, in 1972, Donald Appleyard, {{together}} with Kenneth Craik, received {{funding from the}} National Science Foundation to update {{what had been a}} rather simple <b>environmental</b> <b>simulator</b> purchased from Yale, both of them had been working in the field of environ­ mental cognition for several years. Appleyard's opportunity to work on the Image of the City project with Lynch and Myer had resulted in the book The Viewfrom the Road. During the course of that project he had experimented with three ways of simuiating the experience of driving along highways: notation systems, perspec­ tive sequences and films produced through a modelscope. The notation system describing the environmental experience was the easiest to develop, and it became common practice in urban design throughout the world. Although they do describe components of the experience, notation systems do so in an abstract way-and they are idiosyncratic. Only the inventor understands his system and no one else uses it. To the public, esoteric notation systems are incomprehensible. Sequences of perspectives are much more understandable. They are not used as much, perhaps because the method is still rather abstract and it takes some work to visualize the sequences as a continuous movement experience. Static per­ spective renderings remain the most common way of simulating environmental experience. However, modelscopes, motion picture cameras, and realistic scale models have the most promising pros­ pects of accurately and realistically simulating an experience of the environment...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} underlying processes governing environmental and physical processes, and predict future outcomes, a complex computer model is frequently required to simulate these dynamics. However there is inevitably uncertainty related to the exact parametric form or the values of such parameters to be used when developing these simulators, with ranges of plausible values prevalent in the literature. Systematic errors introduced by failing to account for these uncertainties {{have the potential to}} have a large effect on resulting estimates in unknown quantities of interest. Due to the complexity of these types of models, it is often unfeasible to run large numbers of training runs that are usually required for full statistical emulators of the environmental processes. We therefore present a method for accounting for uncertainties in complex <b>environmental</b> <b>simulators</b> without the need for very large numbers of training runs and illustrate the method through an application to the Met Office's atmospheric transport model NAME. We conclude that there are two principle parameters that are linked with variability in NAME outputs, namely the free tropospheric turbulence parameter and particle release height. Our results suggest the former should be significantly larger than is currently implemented as a default in NAME, whilst changes in the latter most likely stem from inconsistencies between the model specified ground height at the observation locations and the true height at this location. Estimated discrepancies from independent data are consistent with the discrepancy between modelled and true ground height...|$|R
