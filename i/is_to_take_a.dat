25|$|Another way {{to imagine}} wormholes <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> {{sheet of paper}} and draw two {{somewhat}} distant points {{on one side of the}} paper. The sheet of paper represents a plane in the spacetime continuum, and the two points represent a distance to be traveled, however theoretically a wormhole could connect these two points by folding that plane so the points are touching. In this way it would be much easier to traverse the distance since the two points are now touching.|$|E
25|$|The goal of density {{estimation}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> finite {{sample of}} data and to make inferences about the underlying probability density function everywhere, including where no data are observed. In kernel density estimation, the contribution of each data point is smoothed out from a single point into a region of space surrounding it. Aggregating the individually smoothed contributions gives an overall picture {{of the structure of}} the data and its density function. In the details to follow, we show that this approach leads to a reasonable estimate of the underlying density function.|$|E

25|$|A {{flashing}} {{single or}} double yellow aspect {{indicates that a}} train <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> diverging route ahead with a lower line speed than the main route, indicating to the driver to slow the train down {{in time for the}} lower speed of the diverging route. A flashing double yellow (only used in 4-aspect signalling) means that the next signal is showing flashing single yellow. A flashing single yellow means that the next signal at the junction is showing (steady) single yellow with an indication for a diverging route, and the signal beyond the junction is at danger (red). The train driver has to slow the train down in preparation for stopping at the red signal, and this ensures that the train crosses the junction safely. As the train nears the junction, the red signal beyond may 'step up' to a less restrictive aspect depending {{on the state of the}} line ahead.|$|E
25|$|The medieval {{story of}} Sir Eglamour of Artois {{makes use of}} a number of themes and motifs that are found in other romances of the period. Near the very {{beginning}} of the tale the reader, or listener, is at once introduced to two of them. Sir Eglamour is in love with his overlord’s daughter. She is the child and heir of an earl. Sir Eglamour, a relatively poor knight, declares his love for Christabel and is immediately given three impossible tasks to achieve by her angry father in order to win her hand in marriage; just as Culhwch is given an impossibly long list of impossible tasks by Chief Giant Ysbaddaden in the Old Welsh Mabinogion tale How Culhwch won Olwen, in order to win the hand in marriage of his daughter and heir. Sir Eglamour’s first task <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> deer from a forest far to the west, where the Celtic Otherworld is often located. The forest is surrounded by a stone wall and the deer are guarded by a giant who stands fifty feet tall. Despite these difficulties, Sir Eglamour manages to kill the principal stag of the giant’s herd and then kills the giant himself. Having achieved this first trial, Sir Eglamour returns home triumphant, carrying the giant’s head as well as that of the deer.|$|E

"But to read {{popular culture}} as a straight-forward– or at least typical– {{political}} text <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> very narrow view of its meaning, and hence of its political message(s). As we have noted, the text's meaning {{will depend on how}} it is heard and read. Michael Jackson may have intended his 'Earth Song' as an exercise in compassion; others– like Jarvis Cocker– saw it quite differently. One reason these alternative readings emerge is {{because of the way the}} performance of popular culture engages more than a literal text, it employs gestures and symbols, tones of voice, looks and glances, all of which might tell a different story".|$|E

500|$|The season {{does not}} {{directly}} adapt any one storyline from the comics, with DeKnight feeling {{that it was more}} important to focus on [...] "nailing the spirit of the comics".

[...] Vincent D'Onofrio compared telling a story on Netflix to more of a [...] "13-hour film" [...] than a television series and noted that time can be taken to tell the story and [...] "be much more specific". Deborah Ann Woll explained that what she saw as one of the most important themes in the series was normal people having an impact in [...] "seemingly insurmountable circumstances", with the focus not being on Daredevil's abilities or the characters' qualifications, but on their willingness to help people.|$|E

2500|$|The {{derivative}} {{gives the}} best possible linear approximation of a function at a given point, but this can {{be very different from}} the original function. One way of improving the approximation <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> quadratic approximation. That is to say, the linearization of a real-valued function [...] at the point [...] is a linear polynomial , and {{it may be possible to}} get a better approximation by considering a quadratic polynomial [...] [...] Still better might be a cubic polynomial , and this idea can be extended to arbitrarily high degree polynomials. For each one of these polynomials, there should be a best possible choice of coefficients , , , and [...] that makes the approximation as good as possible.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is known}} that there exists no C2 (twice {{continuously}} differentiable) embedding of a flat torus into 3-space. (The idea of the proof <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> large sphere containing such a flat torus in its interior, and shrink the radius of the sphere until it just touches the torus for the first time. Such a point of contact must be a tangency. But that would imply {{that part of the}} torus, since it has zero curvature everywhere, must lie strictly outside the sphere, which is a contradiction.) On the other hand, according to the Nash-Kuiper theorem, proven in the 1950s, an isometric C1 embedding exists. [...] This is solely an existence proof, and does not provide explicit equations for such an embedding.|$|E
