50|$|The bottle is {{normally}} designed {{to have a}} special shoulder radius to push out all air from the inside of the bottle when a sample solution is being filled into the bottle. According to the EPA Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater or the Standard Methods 5210, the BOD bottle should include a <b>ground-glass</b> <b>stopper</b> and a flared mouth which form a water seal preventing the air from the outside of the bottle coming in. The Standard Method 5210 also recommends to use a paper, a foil or a plastic cup to cap over the mouth of the bottle reducing the evaporation during the incubation. Generally, the side of the BOD bottle is permanently screened with white writing area, and is printed with a specific number; both for the aid of the sample identification.|$|E
30|$|Different {{concentrations}} of extractant were prepared by dissolving various amounts of TBP in toluene. All samples were stored in <b>ground-glass</b> <b>stopper</b> bottles {{to prevent the}} evaporation. The {{concentrations of}} extractant were studied and optimized by ultrasonic method in terms of existence of different intermolecular interaction explaining the various acoustic parameters with their deviated values. The ultrasonic velocity of the pure liquids and their freshly prepared mixtures of (TBP-toluene) were measured using multifrequency ultrasonic interferometer operating at different frequencies (1 – 4  MHz). The working principle used in the measurement of velocity of sound through medium {{was based on the}} accurate determination of the wavelength of ultrasonic waves of known frequency produced by quartz crystal in the measuring cell. The temperature of the solution was controlled by circulating water at a desired temperature through the jacket of a double-walled cell.|$|E
50|$|Round-bottom flasks {{often have}} one or more conically tapered ground glass joint openings, or necks. Conventionally, these joints at the flask necks are outer joints. Other adapters, such as {{distillation}} heads and vacuum adapters, are made with joints that fit in with this convention. If a flask or other container has an extra outer ground-glass joint on it, which needs to be closed off for an experiment, there are often conically tapered inner <b>ground-glass</b> <b>stoppers</b> for that purpose. In some cases, small hook-like glass protrusions may be fused onto {{the rest of the}} glass item near a joint to allow an end loop of a small spring to be attached, so the spring helps keep joints temporarily together. The use of a special very small size of conically tapered fitting for glass, plastic, or metal parts called a Luer fitting or adapter has become more widespread. Originally, Luer fittings were used to connect the hub of a needle to a syringe. Where the use of ground glass presents a problem, as in the production or distillation of diazomethane (which may explode on contact with rougher surfaces), equipment with smooth glass joints may be used.|$|R
