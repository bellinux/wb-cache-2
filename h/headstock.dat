5|$|Hanneman used a black Gibson Les Paul {{modified}} with a Kahler Pro tremolo and a Joe Barden Two/Tone Humbucker bridge {{pickup in}} Slayer's early days {{and through the}} Show No Mercy and Hell Awaits era. In mid 1985 he began playing B.C. Rich guitars, notably a Rich Bich model he bought off his band colleague Kerry King, which he subsequently applied various graphics to. His first Bich had a 3x3 <b>headstock,</b> chrome hardware (including the Kahler Pro bridge) and the pickups were DiMarzio Super Distortions. He and King can both also be seen with {{a second set of}} B.C. Rich's around 1986-1987, which had 6-in-line headstocks, black hardware and DiMarzio pickups. He also used a B.C. Rich Ironbird model more rarely. From 1987, he was seen using a custom made B.C. Rich Gunslinger with similar specs as his '86-'87 era Bich, shortly after he had the pickups replaced with two active EMG 81 humbuckers. In 1988 he began playing the famous Jackson Soloist that he would use constantly as his main guitar for songs played in E-flat tuning until 2001. It was originally shipped to him with passive Jackson pickups (probably a J-50 and J-80) and a JE-1200 mid-boost circuit, but the pickups were soon changed for EMG 81 pickups and the mid-boost circuit was removed as well. Around 1990-1991 Hanneman began using ESP guitars, he mostly used as backup for this Jackson Soloist and other tunings. He had his own signature model made, based on the specs of his original Jackson Soloist. In 2000, Hanneman switched to ESP guitars, which he used exclusively until he stopped touring in early 2011. ESP also gave Hanneman his own signature model (see below), which is still available for purchase. When touring, Hanneman carried six guitars due to the different tunings he utilized. Most albums such as Haunting the Chapel – Divine Intervention and World Painted Blood have E-flat tuning. However, albums such as Diabolus in Musica – Christ Illusion feature alternate tunings such as Drop B and utilizing seven string guitars. The first album, Show No Mercy, was recorded in standard tuning, while live performances of those songs were played in E-flat since about 1984.|$|E
5|$|The line {{score is}} {{displayed}} on the guitar's neck, while the ball/strike/out count, the batter's uniform number, and the hit/error indicator are all situated on the <b>headstock.</b> Six small advertising signs represent the tuning keys. The body of the guitar currently features only an LED display board for displaying messages. Initially, the scoreboard featured two matrix message boards: a low-resolution RGB color board on the left which featured advertising and animations, and a white-light monochromatic board on the right, which primarily featured statistical information and other text-based messages. The monochrome board was replaced by an orange-tinted LED display board in 2009 which served both purposes, while the color board was deactivated and covered with advertising signage. The Greer Stadium scoreboard has never {{had the ability to}} display video or any kind of high-resolution images. Between the two boards are an analog clock and a current temperature display. As of 2014, the temperature display is no longer active. Around the boards are four large spaces for advertising; the two on top are static, and the two on bottom rotate between three images each (the rotating spaces have been covered with static signage since 2009). High-tension nets cover the electronic sections to protect them from home run balls. Above the board is a circular advertising space. This space originally displayed the team's guitar-swinger logo, and at times has displayed other Sounds logos. Originally, when a home run was hit, the guitar-swinger logo would light up and perimeter lights around the entire scoreboard would begin flashing; it was also capable of shooting fireworks after each Sounds home run. By the mid-2000s, the scoreboard had fallen into a state of disrepair and obsolescence, and was only marginally functional. Many of the lights were no longer able to be lit, and replacement parts were becoming hard to find. When MFP Baseball purchased the team in late 2008, the organization made minor renovations to the scoreboard, rendering it once again fully functional, although not to its original specifications. It was also repainted black, red, yellow, and white over its original red, white, and blue color scheme to reflect the team's present colors.|$|E

25|$|A clip-on tuner clips {{on to an}} instrument—such as {{onto the}} <b>headstock</b> of a guitar or the bell of a trombone. A {{vibration}} sensor built into the clip tranmits the instrument vibrations to the tuning circuitry. The absence of a microphone makes these tuners immune to background noise, so musicians can tune in noisy environments, including while other musicians are tuning. The clip-on tuner was invented in 1995 by Mark Wilson of OnBoard Research Corporation, which marketed it as The Intellitouch Tuner Model PT1.|$|E

The spinning mule has a fixed frame with a creel of cylindrical bobbins to hold the roving, connected through the <b>headstock</b> to a parallel carriage with the spindles. On the outward motion, the rovings are paid out through attenuating rollers and twisted. On the return, the roving is clamped and the spindles reversed to take up the newly spun thread.|$|E
25|$|In 1984 Guild {{released}} {{the first official}} Red Special replica for mass production, and made some prototypes specifically for May. However the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300guitars. In 1993 Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer—the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998—as back-up. They are almost identical to the original, except for the Fryer logo on the <b>headstock</b> (May's original one has a sixpence).|$|E

500|$|On December 19, 1991, {{the band}} played their final show of the tour in Hollywood at the Whisky a Go Go opening for The Smashing Pumpkins, which ended with Love smashing her guitar <b>headstock</b> onstage {{at the end of}} their set after lukewarm {{reception}} from the audience. Los Angeles Times journalist David Cromelin noted in his review of the concert: Smashing Pumpkins' singer-guitarist Billy Corgan referred to himself as [...] "a frustrated Midwestern youth" [...] at the Whisky on Tuesday... Smashing Pumpkins was preceded by smashing guitars, courtesy of Hole. The tortured, transfixing L.A. group's pairing with the headliners should have made this a bill to remember, but the audience was primed for Pumpkin and didn't take to Courtney Love's powerful howls of anguish. Hole ended its set in a tantrum, as Love ordered the band to halt and hurled her guitar to the ground. Guitarist Eric Erlandson finished things off by demolishing his instrument with a few impressive swings. Frustrated Midwestern youth, meet frustrated California youth.|$|E

40|$|Engineered fibre {{composites}} {{offer an}} extremely versatile option to strengthen existing structures to solve structural problems arising from environmental exposure, inadequate designs, increased traffic loads and continuous aging of existing structures. While the behaviour of structures by external post-tensioning using fibre composites for flexure is well understood, {{there is limited}} research on shear strengthening, specifically using prestressed fibre composites. An innovative system using fibre composites has been investigated for strengthening bridge <b>headstocks</b> with deficient structural performance. The innovative system uses fibre composite wraps which forms an infinite loop around the <b>headstocks</b> and together with anchorage blocks, these are pushed-out and the gap packed with a suitable spacer to maintain the applied pre-stressing force. This paper discusses the research, development and construction of this innovative fibre composite post-tensioning system and testing it on a model bridge <b>headstocks</b> in Tenthill Creek Bridge. Issues related {{to the effect of}} existing shear cracks and the importance of repairing such cracks will be discussed.

40|$|The optimum {{designs of}} <b>headstocks</b> of {{precision}} lathes are studied. Three different outer shapes of <b>headstocks</b> are explored. Thermal deformations due to heat generated by spindle bearings are considered. The {{objective is to}} minimise the overall deflection of the workpiece at the cutting point. The constraint is to force the fundamental natural frequency {{much greater than the}} working frequency in order to reduce dynamic deflections, The design variables include the shape dimensions, the locations of the spindle bearings, the stiffnesses of the spindle bearings, the dimensions of the fins and the locations of the fins. The genetic algorithm is utilised to solve these mixed-variable optimisation problems. Optimum solutions for the three different types of <b>headstocks</b> are found and discussed.
