500|$|Robinson {{started the}} first few matches of the 2014–15 season, but with the loan signing of Jason Steele from Middlesbrough, he was dropped from the first team. On 15 November 2014, Robinson {{announced}} his intentions of leaving the club in the January transfer window. He said that, [...] "I'm pretty much surplus to requirements at Blackburn. I'm {{not even on the}} bench. I'm training hard at the moment though. My contract is {{up at the end of}} the season so I'm not sure if that's got anything to do with it. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> playing and, I believe, I've got another two or three years left in me." [...] At the end of the season, it was announced that he would be released at the end of his contract.|$|E
500|$|On 17 July 2009, Del Piero {{extended}} {{his contract with}} Juventus by one more year until 30 June 2011 in Pinzolo while training for pre-season, thus practically ensuring that he would retire at the club with which he started his professional career. During his renewal, he said, [...] "I am happy at Juventus and we are competitive. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> playing {{for as long as}} I can and I'm certain that for at least two more years I will be at the top level." [...] On 14 February 2010, Del Piero marked his 445th Serie A appearance, breaking the all-time club record previously held by Boniperti, with a brace in a 3–2 win against Genoa. Del Piero finished the season as the all-time top scorer for Juventus, having scored over 250 goals in all competitions with the club, and having also made over 600 appearances in official matches for Juventus, breaking Scirea's appearance record.|$|E
500|$|During a 2001 {{interview}} with Gary Graff from Wall of Sound Magazine, Maida recounted {{the inspiration for}} the lyrics of [...] "Are You Sad". He was in New York recording [...] "In Repair" [...] at the old Hit Factory studio, which was later known as Avatar Studios. Following those sessions, Maida attempted to call his younger brother from his hotel room but couldn't get through. [...] "When you're making a record, you kind of go into hiding, especially when I'm writing lyrics or writing music; I tend not {{to keep in touch with}} any friends or family or stuff. But my brother and I have a good relationship, and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it good. I couldn't get a hold of him for, like, a week, and I knew he was going through a shitty time — typical young-20s, no job, having a tough life. I wanted to talk to him desperately, and this song just came out of me, [...] "Are You Sad?" [...] It came out really quickly on a shitty travel guitar". The meaning of [...] "If You Believe" [...] was revealed in a 2001 {{interview with}} Cleveland.com, [...] "That song's about having an out-of-body experience and seeing that the afterlife is real," [...] Maida confirms, [...] "and telling people that there's something machines can't have, and we've got it.|$|E

500|$|Lewis's sister Leslie Lewis {{provides}} backing vocals on two tracks, {{while her}} father Eddie Gordon plays the bass harp and harmonica. [...] "He was ill last year, {{so we started}} speaking to one another," [...] Lewis told The Independent. [...] "There were no hard feelings. He just wasn't around. Every couple of years I'd get a postcard from the road – {{a picture of him}} standing next to a giant ice-sculpture of a crab, in Alaska. He was a very mysterious character. But I thought this was the right time to bring him in." [...] "The Next Messiah" [...] was influenced by her father. [...] "When someone isn't around you create what you imagine your father might be – 'a race-car driver, a four-leaf clover'," [...] Lewis explained. Lewis has said that a lot of her inspiration, for both Acid Tongue and previous work, comes from her parents. Lewis also told The Independent, [...] "I just don't know them very well. And I'm still trying to understand what happened [...] and why. It's this blank slate, I can't even remember what happened. But for some reason, these two people are so incredibly strange and funny and beautiful and messed up, that <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> writing about them... and maybe figure out who I am in the process." ...|$|E
500|$|In August, Stefani {{filed for}} divorce from her husband Gavin Rossdale after almost {{thirteen}} years of marriage. In October, Stefani revealed to Entertainment Weekly that she scrapped the album and started again, since [...] "t didn't feel right. [...] I didn't feel fulfilled. That record with Benny was done that way because I had just given birth and had just started on The Voice and felt like I should do something in music, but what was I going to do? There wasn't enough time. So I {{tried to make a}} record where I was just kind of involved—which is how {{a lot of people do}} it, but it didn't work for me". She later told Zane Lowe that she had attempted to curate an entire album, but it did not feel right and she needed to write her own material. She also revealed that she felt inspired again and started writing a lot of songs in a rapid progression, revealing: [...] "I think I have enough for probably two albums. [...] I have to write a few more songs, because I feel like, might as well keep going while it's there. [...] I got 20 songs. I have a whole record in eight weeks, but <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> writing." [...] Stefani also revealed she had worked with musicians Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Greg Kurstin, in addition to production duo Mattman & Robin and the Stargate production team. The album was completed in January 2016. Stefani revealed in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres on February 25 that [...] "'four of five' songs" [...] were written in the previous month.|$|E
500|$|O'Hara's {{first major}} film role {{was that of}} Mary Yellen in Jamaica Inn (1939), {{directed}} by Alfred Hitchcock and co-starring Laughton. O'Hara portrayed the innkeeper's niece, an orphan who goes {{to live with her}} aunt and uncle at a Cornish tavern, a heroine which she describes as [...] "torn between the love of her family and her love for a lawman in disguise". Laughton insisted that she change her name to the shorter [...] "O'Mara" [...] or [...] "O'Hara", and she eventually decided on the latter after expressing contempt at both. [...] When she said [...] "I like Maureen Fitzsimons and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> it", Laughton replied with, [...] "Very well, you're Maureen O'Hara." [...] (O'Hara would later say that [...] "nobody would ever get [...] straight.") [...] O'Hara noted that Laughton had always wanted a daughter of his own, and treated her as such, and she later stated that Laughton's death in 1962 was like losing a parent. She worked well under Hitchcock, professing to have [...] "never experienced the strange feeling of detachment with Hitchcock that many other actors claimed to have felt while working with him." [...] On the contrary, Laughton was engaged in a bitter battle with Hitchcock throughout the production and resented many of Hitchcock's ideas, including changing the nature of the villain from the novel. Though Jamaica Inn is generally seen by critics and the director himself as one of his weakest films, O'Hara was praised, with one critic stating [...] "the newcomer, Maureen O'Hara is charming to look at and distinct promise as an actress". Seeing the film was an eyeopener for O'Hara and change in self-perception, having always seen herself as a tomboy and realizing that on screen she was a woman of great beauty to others. When she returned to Ireland briefly after the film was completed it dawned on her that life {{would never be the same}} again, and she was hurt when she attempted to make pleasant conversation to some local girls and they rejected her advances, considering her to be very arrogant.|$|E

2500|$|The {{next big}} {{test for the}} young {{prospect}} {{took place at the}} Millennium Stadium in Cardiff just over a year later in September 2007 when Cleverly met tough Ugandan Joey Vegas. [...] Cleverly at that time boasted a record of 10–0 and Vegas 10–1. [...] The fight ended with a gruelling points win over 8 rounds for the Welshman in what was his toughest fight to date. [...] Speaking about the result to the BBC and referring to the sparring he received in the Enzo Calzaghe gym, Cleverly said [...] "I'm still young and won't be hitting my peak for about eight years, but think how good the wars I'm having in the gym now are doing me for the future... <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> on progressing, to go for the British title, then maybe a world crown in a couple of years." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Rodríguez, {{the origins}} of the film go back to Desperado. He says, [...] "When I met Danny, I said, 'This guy should be like the Mexican Jean-Claude Van Damme or Charles Bronson, putting out a movie every year and his name should be Machete.' So I decided to do that way back when, never got around to it until finally now. So now, of course, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> going and do a feature." [...] In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone magazine, Rodriguez said that he wrote the screenplay back in 1993 when he cast Trejo in Desperado. [...] "So I wrote him this idea of a federale from Mexico who gets hired to do hatchet jobs in the U.S. I had heard sometimes FBI or DEA have a really tough job that they don't want to get their own agents killed on, they'll hire an agent from Mexico to come do the job for $25,000. I thought, [...] "That's Machete. He would come and do a really dangerous job for {{a lot of money to}} him but for everyone else over here it's peanuts." [...] But I never got around to making it." ...|$|E
