5|$|The company's {{television}} stations, for {{the most}} part non–network affiliated, were known for showing classic films (both RKO productions and many others) under the banner of Million Dollar Movie, launched by New York's WOR-TV in 1954. In June 1962, RKO General and Zenith Electronics initiated what became the first extended venture into subscription television service: through early 1969, Hartford, Connecticut's WHCT-TV aired movies, sports, classical and pop music concerts, and other live performances without commercials, generating income from <b>descrambler</b> installation and weekly rental fees as well as individual program charges. However, RKO General's most notable legacy is what may be the longest licensing dispute in television history. It began in 1965, when General Tire was accused of obliging vendors to buy advertising with one of its stations if they wanted to keep their contracts. More than two decades' worth of legal actions ensued, eventually forcing GenCorp (the parent company since 1983 of both General Tire and RKO General) to sell off its broadcast holdings under FCC pressure. RKO General exited the media business permanently in 1991.|$|E

These services, however, require a <b>descrambler</b> box.|$|E
25|$|When Home Box Office (HBO) began {{scrambling}} its signal on a 24-hour {{basis on}} January 15, 1986, it offered subscriptions to home dish owners for $12.95 per month ($28.92 in 2017 dollars), which was either {{equal to or}} slightly higher than what cable subscribers paid. HBO also advised viewers that purchasing a <b>descrambler</b> for $395 ($882.21 in 2017 dollars) would (along with the monthly fee) allow them to continue watching HBO. Several satellite dish dealers across the United States closed their stores {{as a result of}} a reduction in dish sales, caused by the rise in signal scrambling. Satellite dish owners began protests over scrambling, saying that clear signals from cable channels would become difficult to receive. One such protest was by members of the Satellite Television Industry Association, who converged on Washington, D.C., in March 1986 to urge the United States Congress to protect access to satellite transmissions.|$|E
5000|$|Multiplicative scramblers lead to error {{multiplication}} during descrambling (i.e. a single-bit error at the <b>descrambler's</b> input {{will result}} in w errors at its output, where w equals {{the number of the}} scrambler's feedback taps).|$|R

50|$|After Popular Electronics {{went under}} after {{attempting}} {{to become a}} computer magazine in the early 1980s, Radio-Electronics published many eye-catching feature projects like a series on cable TV <b>descramblers.</b> Some projects were designed by kit manufacturers like PAiA Electronics, North Country Radio, Information Unlimited, Almost All Digital Electronics, and Ramsey Electronics.|$|R
25|$|In October 1984, the U.S. Congress {{passed the}} Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, which gave those using TVRO systems {{the right to}} receive signals for free unless they were scrambled, and {{required}} those who did scramble to make their signals available for a reasonable fee. Since cable channels could prevent reception by big dishes, other companies had an incentive to offer competition. In January 1986, HBO began using the now-obsolete VideoCipher II system to encrypt their channels. Other channels uses less secure television encryption systems. The scrambling of HBO was met with much protest from owners of big-dish systems, most of which had no other option at the time for receiving such channels, claiming that clear signals from cable channels {{would be difficult to}} receive. Eventually HBO allowed dish owners to subscribe directly to their service for $12.95 per month, a price equal to or higher than what cable subscribers were paying, and required a <b>descrambler</b> to be purchased for $395. This led to the attack on HBO's transponder Galaxy 1 by John R. MacDougall in April 1986. One by one, all commercial channels followed HBO's lead and began scrambling their channels. The Satellite Broadcasting and Communications Association SBCA was founded on December 2, 1986 {{as the result of a}} merger between SPACE and the Direct Broadcast Satellite Association (DBSA).|$|E
2500|$|Videocipher II used analog {{scrambling}} on its {{video signal}} and Data Encryption Standard based encryption on its audio signal. VideoCipher II was defeated, {{and there was}} a black market for <b>descrambler</b> devices, which were initially sold as [...] "test" [...] devices.|$|E
2500|$|HBO became {{involved}} in several lawsuits during the 1980s, involving legal statutes imposed by state and city laws that {{would have resulted in}} some programs on HBO and other pay television networks being censored by cable systems, if not forcing the pay services to edit inappropriate content from the programming they aired. In January 1986, HBO became the first satellite-delivered television network to encrypt its signal from unauthorized viewing by way of the Videocipher II system; this initially resulted in a mass lodge of complaints from television receive-only (TVRO) satellite users that previously received HBO's programming without a subscription. The objections by TVRO users over having to now pay for HBO as cable subscribers had long done (requiring dish subscribers to purchase an expensive <b>descrambler</b> to unencrypt the signal) came to a head four months later, as HBO became a victim of broadcast signal intrusion when satellite television dealer John R. MacDougall, a Florida man calling himself [...] "Captain Midnight", redirected a receiver dish towards the network's transponder on Galaxy 1 and intercepted its signal during a movie presentation of The Falcon and the Snowman; MacDougall overrode the telecast of the film with a text-based message placed over SMPTE color bars in protest of the channel's decision to scramble its signal for home satellite subscribers. The Federal Communications Commission subsequently prosecuted MacDougall for committing the intrusion.|$|E

50|$|By the 1990s, tiers became common, with {{customers}} able {{to subscribe to}} different tiers to obtain different selections of additional channels above the basic selection. By subscribing to additional tiers, customers could get specialty channels, movie channels, and foreign channels.

5000|$|Specialty {{television}} channels {{available only}} on cable {{began to be}} established in 1983, and systems continued to expand and upgrade their channel capacity, notably by deploying fibre-optics to carry signals as far as neighbourhoods before converting to coaxial cable for the final run to the customer premises. The use of fibre optic cables {{as far back as}} the 1970s does not imply that cable companies were using digital methods to transmit signals as is sometimes assumed by the modern viewer, this is a common misunderstanding. Methods were developed and deployed {{as far back as the}} 1970s to transmit analog video using frequency division multiplexing via fibre-optic cabling. Digital signaling is a much more modern practice which only began in the early 2000s.

5000|$|An {{addressable}} {{cable box}} {{is one that}} can be controlled by the local cable company. Addressability is the process by which (optionally encrypted) messages are sent from the cable provider for a particular cable box via the cable signal. The cable company can [...] "address" [...] a particular customer's cable box to command it to activate or deactivate the descrambling of selected premium or pay-per view channels. The system can also send messages. This function affords the cable company the ability to add or delete descrambling on the channels that come in through the coaxial cable line. It also allows them to remotely disable the box, for reasons such as non-payment of the cable bill or theft of the unit itself. Such commands are referred to as bullets and are a transmitted message which affects the cable box program effectively disabling or [...] "killing" [...] it. [...] "Bullets" [...] do not affect the electronics inside converters or <b>descramblers,</b> only the programming. Non-addressable boxes are [...] "bulletproof", as they are unable to detect such messages.|$|R

50|$|In 1992, {{following}} years of security breaches with the Videocipher II system, General Instruments introduced the Videocipher II Plus <b>descrambler</b> module. In 1993, some VCII programming was phased out, especially premium movie channels and pay per view. For a time, many networks and Sports CH (now Fox sports) {{remained on the}} VC II stream. The Videocipher II+ was a higher-security system with two variants. The Videocipher-RS system (RS for Renewable Security) is the Videocipher II Plus system with a slot {{in the back of}} the <b>descrambler</b> module to where a card could be inserted to upgrade the security if the VCII Plus system were ever breached.|$|E

50|$|Videocipher II was {{the first}} {{consumer}} TVRO scrambling system. It began testing in 1985 on HBO satellite transponders on Satcom 3R and Galaxy 1 and entered full use in January 1986 by HBO and sister channel Cinemax, and within two years was used {{by a majority of}} major cable television programmers. However, lapses in its security enabled some pirate decryption, modifying the <b>descrambler</b> to receive free programming. Beginning in 1991, programmers began to phase out the VCII system in favor of the highly secure Videocipher II Plus (RS) system. The system was fully phased out in 1993. Originally sold as a stand-alone decoder box that consisted of a fully electronic decoder and <b>descrambler</b> module, other satellite system manufacturers began to manufacturer their receivers with the GI <b>descrambler</b> module installed. This VCII system digitally encrypts stereo audio using the DES encryption scheme and scrambles video by inverting the video polarity and moving color information to a nonstandard area frequency. It is noteworthy that the Videocipher II Plus design did not alter the video scrambling scheme (only the audio encryption was improved). As such, a Videocipher II decoder is still capable of decoding the video portion of a Videocipher II Plus encrypted stream. In the late eighties and early nineties, VideoCipher II modules that had been pirated, began to receive constant Electronic Counter Measures (ECM).|$|E
