50|$|<b>Focus</b> <b>on</b> form (FonF) is an {{approach}} to language education in which learners are {{made aware of the}} grammatical form of language features that they are already able to use communicatively. It is contrasted with <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> forms, which is limited solely to the explicit <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> language features, and <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> meaning, which is limited to <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> meaning with no attention paid to form at all. For a teaching intervention to qualify as <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> form and not as <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> forms, the learner must be aware of the meaning and use of the language features before the form is brought to their attention. <b>Focus</b> <b>on</b> form was proposed by Michael Long in 1988.|$|R

30|$|Considering the Hair et al. (2010) classification, Pearson’s {{correlation}} between the four factors indicated coefficients that can be classified as moderate (between the <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the problem and <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> social support factors and between the <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> religious coping and the <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> emotion factors) and low (all other two factor combinations). This indicates the existence of different styles of coping with difficult situations in the academic environment and also a composition among these styles that indicates the pairing of <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> social support with <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> the problem and <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> emotion with <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> religious coping. In general, {{the results show that}} some of the students tended to <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> external solutions from religious coping, while others <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> problem solving, self-control, or social support. As these strategies represent distinct styles of dealing with difficulties in academic life (Seidl et al., 2001; Vinay et al., 2000), their identification can contribute to proposals {{on how to deal with}} each student profile, in order to support them in this period of adaptation to university life.|$|R
