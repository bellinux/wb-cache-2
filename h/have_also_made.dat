Noh, kyogen, bunraku, and kabuki plays derived from folk tales feature them, as do contemporary {{works such as}} anime, manga and video games. Japanese metal idol band Babymetal refer to the kitsune myth in their lyrics and {{include the use of}} fox masks, hand signs, and animation interludes during live shows. Western authors of fiction <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>made</b> use of the kitsune legends.|$|E
5|$|Epsilon Eridani is {{a target}} for planet finding {{programs}} because it has properties that allow an Earth-like planet to form. Although this system was not chosen as a primary candidate for the now-canceled Terrestrial Planet Finder, it was a target star for NASA's proposed Space Interferometry Mission to search for Earth-sized planets. The proximity, Sun-like properties and suspected planets of Epsilon Eridani <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>made</b> it the subject of multiple studies on whether an interstellar probe {{can be sent to}} Epsilon Eridani.|$|E

5|$|European {{classical}} music changed greatly in the 20th century. New music abandoned {{much of the}} historical, nationally developed schools of harmony and melody in favor of experimental music, atonality, minimalism and electronic music, all of which employ features that have become common to European music in general and not Italy specifically. These changes <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>made</b> {{classical music}} less accessible to many people. Important composers of the period include Ottorino Respighi, Ferruccio Busoni, Alfredo Casella, Gian Francesco Malipiero, Franco Alfano, Bruno Maderna, Luciano Berio, Luigi Nono, Sylvano Bussotti, Salvatore Sciarrino, Luigi Dallapiccola, Carlo Jachino, Gian Carlo Menotti, Jacopo Napoli, and Goffredo Petrassi.|$|E
5|$|Minnesotans <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>made</b> {{significant}} contributions to comedy, theater, media, and film. The comic strip Peanuts was created by St. Paul native Charles M. Schulz. Garrison Keillor resurrected old-style radio comedy with A Prairie Home Companion, which has aired since 1974. A cult scifi cable t.v. triumph, Mystery Science Theater 3000, was created by Joel Hodgson in Hopkins, and Minneapolis, MN. Another popular comedy staple developed in the 1990s, The Daily Show, was originated through Lizz Winstead and Madeleine Smithberg.|$|E

Characters of the Shaman King series <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>made</b> appearances in the games Jump Super Stars and Jump Ultimate Stars.|$|E
5|$|Chao <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>made</b> {{occasional}} {{appearances in}} Archie Comics' Sonic the Hedgehog comic book series. They debuted in an Sonic Adventure-based story arc, {{where they work}} together with Tikal to defeat Chaos. At one point, Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles find a Chao garden and one Chao followed Sonic home, and after spending time around his Roboticized father came to resemble Omochao. However, Eggman destroys the garden, and the Chao migrate to a lake. Much later, Cream and her mother Vanilla protect a frightened but incompetent group of Chao from Eggman's assistant, Snively. Cream's friend Amy Rose realizes {{they are the same}} group from the lake and, to Cream's delight, suggests that the lake can be converted to a Chao garden. Following the comic reboot, Cheese continued to accompany Cream while Chocola was revealed to live with her mother Vanilla and Gemerl (from Sonic Advance 3). The heroes would also discover a Chao Garden hidden in an undersea cavern whose inhabitants included an ancient Chao named Aquarius and a guard dog-like Chao named Crusher.|$|E
5|$|Gulls {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} seen seabirds, given their use of human-made habitats (such as cities and dumps) and their often fearless nature. They therefore also have made it into the popular consciousness – they have been used metaphorically, as in Jonathan Livingston Seagull by Richard Bach, or to denote a closeness to the sea, such as their use in The Lord of the Rings both in the insignia of Gondor and therefore Númenor (used in the design of the films), and to call Legolas to (and across) the sea. Other species <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>made</b> an impact; pelicans have long been associated with mercy and altruism because of an early Western Christian myth that they split open their breast to feed their starving chicks.|$|E

5|$|Justice Potter Stewart, {{joined by}} Justice Hugo Black, dissented. Stewart {{acknowledged}} that the Wolf River Treaty unquestionably conferred hunting and fishing rights on the tribe and its members. He stated that the Termination Act subjected {{the members of the}} tribe to the same laws that all other citizens of Wisconsin were held to, including hunting and fishing regulations. In Stewart's opinion, Public Law 280 had no bearing on the case and the rights were not protected by the Termination Act, so they were lost. Stewart did note that this would <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>made</b> the claim for compensation valid under Shoshone Tribe v. United States, regardless of whether Congress intended it or not. He would have reversed the decision of the Court of Claims.|$|E

5|$|The 3rd Birthday {{was created}} as a {{conceptual}} rebirth for Aya's character, {{as well as a}} means of re-introducing her to the gaming community, with it being over a decade since the last game in the series. Among the staff were Hajime Tabata, Yoshinori Kitase, Motomu Toriyama, Isamu Kamikokuryo, and Aya's original designer Tetsuya Nomura. Originally announced as an episodic title for mobile phones, the game was later changed into a PSP exclusive. Upon release, the game reached sixth place in Japanese sales charts, and was among the top five games in North American and UK sales charts during its opening months. Reviews have been mixed; critics praised the presentation and several parts of the gameplay, while opinions were mixed about the story, and many cited difficulties with camera control and some of the shooter mechanics. Several reviewers <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>made</b> negative comments on Aya's portrayal.|$|E
5|$|The Mets {{have made}} 11 {{selections}} in the supplemental {{round of the}} draft. They <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>made</b> the first overall selection five times (1966, 1968, 1980, 1984, and 1994), tied for the most such picks with the San Diego Padres. The first of these picks, Steve Chilcott (1966), {{is one of only}} two first overall picks (along with Brien Taylor) to never play in the major leagues. The Mets have had 18 compensatory picks since the institution of the First-Year Player Draft in 1965. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the prior off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year. One player, George Ambrow (1970), did not sign with the Mets after he was drafted but they received no compensation pick.|$|E
5|$|The Padres {{have made}} 21 {{selections}} in the supplemental {{round of the}} draft. They <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>made</b> the first overall selection five times (1970, 1972, 1974, 1988, and 2004), tied for the most such picks with the New York Mets. They have also had 24 compensatory picks since {{the institution of the}} First-Year Player Draft in 1965. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the previous off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year. The Padres have failed to sign two of their first-round picks, Karsten Whitson (2010) and Brett Austin (2011), and received the 10th pick in 2011 and 55th pick in 2012 as compensation.|$|E

5|$|Various {{insects and}} arachnids reside around the Petitcodiac River. Among them is the stonefly, the mayfly, the caddisfly, the simulium, the {{subfamily}} of tanypodinae, and the Hydracarina. Non-native species, such as the black-footed spider, the beech scale, the white-marked tussock moth, and the mountain ash sawfly <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>made</b> their home in the Petitcodiac River watershed. At the southern extremities of the watershed, 50 to 90percent of the world's semipalmated sandpipers feed on the mud shrimp at Shepody Bay. Around 269,445 stop there before migrating to South America, a number which accounts for at least 7.7percent of the total population. Among others, the semipalmated plover (around 2percent of the North American population), the short-billed dowitcher, the red knot, the sanderling, and the least sandpiper are also known for migrating through the Important Bird Area.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Kart is also {{credited}} {{as being}} the first non-platforming game to feature multiple playable characters from the Mario franchise. As well as several sequels Nintendo has released numerous other sporting and non-sporting Mario spin-offs since Super Mario Kart; a trend in part accredited to the commercial and critical success of the game. The Mario characters have appeared in many sports games including those relating to basketball, baseball, golf, tennis and soccer. Non-sporting franchises using the Mario characters have also been created, including the Super Smash Bros. series of fighting games and the Mario Party series of board game based, party games. Mario series characters <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>made</b> cameos in games from other series such as SSX on Tour and NBA Street V3, both published by EA Sports. The genre spanning nature of the Mario series that was sparked off {{by the success of}} Super Mario Kart has been described as key to the success and longevity of the franchise; keeping fans interested despite the infrequency of traditional Mario platforming games. Following this model the Mario series has gone on to become the best selling video game franchise of all time with 193 million units sold as of January 2007, almost 40 million units ahead of second ranked franchise (Pokémon, also by Nintendo).|$|E
