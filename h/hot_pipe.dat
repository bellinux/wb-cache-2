Tucker still angrily insists he did not kill her, and he agrees to submit to a {{polygraph}} test. When Bayliss leaves, Pembleton speaks to Tucker in a soft and comforting tone, trying to get Tucker to trust him. Pembleton suggests Tucker had a drink and blacked out the night he killed Adena, and he seems close to getting a confession before Tucker once again insists he is innocent. With four hours left before the deadline, Bayliss returns and says Tucker failed the polygraph test. Bayliss and Pembleton then aggressively team up on Tucker, talking quickly and intimidating him with repeated questions. They bring up a previously dropped statutory rape charge against Tucker involving a 14-year-old girl, then suggest he attempted {{to have sex with}} Adena and killed her because she resisted. They confront Tucker with gruesome crime scene photos of Adena and ask him if he is sure he didn't kill her, to which a frightened and confused Tucker replies, [...] "Not right now, I'm not." ...|$|E

Undoubtedly, I think, the first pipe is the sweetest; indeed, I feel bound to make a statement here. I have an uneasy feeling that I never did justice to meerschaums, and for this reason: I only smoked them after my brier was hot, so that I never gave them a fair chance. If I had begun the day with a meerschaum, might it not have shown itself in a new light? That is a point I shall never be able to decide now, but I often think of it, and I leave the verdict to others.|$|E

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} various ways of energetically {{advantageous}} utilization of waste heat produced by industrial technologies. The {{focus of the}} diploma thesis is both to {{provide an overview of}} different ways and places of origin of waste heat in industrial technologies and of its possible reutilization, to suggest a concrete air heating system using waste heat and to propose a long-distance <b>hot</b> water <b>pipe</b> which supplies <b>hot</b> water <b>pipe</b> system with energy. First, technologies producing waste heat and some ways of regressing of heat in such technologies are theoretically described. Second, the equipment for transferring of heat and for adjustment of thermal energy parameters is described. A special focus is put on water supplies of the Nuclear Power Plant Dukovany and some selected parts of its secondary circuit, which is waste heat collected from. The analysis is supplemented by a calculation of theoretical quantity of waste heat. The aim of the calculation is to determine whether waste heat can be a source of energy for heating. Then, a current system of heating of three selected buildings {{in the area of the}} Nuclear Power Plant Dukovany is briefly described. Based on the gained knowledge, a project of air heating with two heat pumps type water – water, a heat receiver preparing warm service water and three recuperative units for preheating of fresh heating air is designed. The selection of main parts of the air heating is amended by a calculation of purchase costs and electric energy consumption. After that, the focus is placed on choice of type of <b>hot</b> water <b>pipe</b> – its trace is stated and an indicative estimation and a thermal-conditions calculation in the <b>hot</b> water <b>pipe</b> are made. The preliminary calculation serves as a source of information for a final project of air heating and calculation of changes of temperatures longwise the <b>hot</b> water <b>pipe.</b> The project contains also a calculation of pressure losses and an analysis of economical questions concerning <b>hot</b> water <b>pipes.</b> In conclusion, the results of project of air heating and <b>hot</b> water <b>pipes</b> are summarized...|$|R

5000|$|Smoking problems: Any {{route of}} {{administration}} poses {{its own set of}} health risks; in the case of crack cocaine, smoking tends to be more harmful than other routes. Crack users tend to smoke the drug because that has a higher bioavailability than other routes typically used for drugs of abuse such as insufflation. Crack has a melting point of around 90 °C (194 °F), and the smoke does not remain potent for long. Therefore, crack pipes are generally very short, to minimize the time between evaporating and ingestion (thereby minimizing loss of potency). Having a very <b>hot</b> <b>pipe</b> pressed against the lips often causes cracked and blistered lips, colloquially known as [...] "crack lip". The use of [...] "convenience store crack pipes" [...] - glass tubes which originally contained small artificial roses - may contribute to this condition. These 4-inch (10-cm) pipes are not durable and will quickly develop breaks; users may continue to use the pipe even though it has been broken to a shorter length. The <b>hot</b> <b>pipe</b> might burn the lips, tongue, or fingers, especially when passed between people who take hits in rapid succession, causing the short pipe to reach higher temperatures than if used by one person alone.|$|E

50|$|Detecting and {{eliminating}} poor bonding is relatively straightforward. Detection is accomplished using a simple DC voltmeter, with test probe leads placed in various {{locations in the}} plumbing. Typically, a probe on a <b>hot</b> <b>pipe</b> and a probe on a cold pipe will tell the user if there is improper grounding. Anything beyond a few millivolts is significant, and potentials of 200 mV are common. A missing bond will show up best {{in the area of}} the gap, as the measured electrical potential dissipates over distance. The missing bond is usually located near the cold water inlet to the building, as filtration and treatment equipment are usually added there, but pinhole leaks can occur anywhere downstream or upstream from the interruption of electrical continuity.|$|E

5000|$|In Saw, Jigsaw has chained {{the man who}} {{diagnosed}} his cancer, Dr. Lawrence Gordon, in {{a dilapidated}} industrial washroom with Adam Stanheight, a photographer who has been tailing the doctor due to belief he is cheating on his wife. Lawrence has instructions to kill Adam by six o'clock, or else {{his wife and daughter}} will be killed. Flashbacks show detectives David Tapp and Steven Sing, who suspect Lawrence of being Jigsaw, following a trail of clues from other Jigsaw traps. Sing's death from a shotgun trap after saving a victim named Jeff causes Tapp to obsess over catching Jigsaw. Later on, he chases Zep Hindle, who monitors Adam and Lawrence's tests, and gets shot in the chest. Eventually, Lawrence saws his own foot off in order to escape, leaving Adam in the bathroom while Lawrence goes to try to save his family and get help for Adam. It is later seen in Saw 3D that Dr. Gordon found a steaming <b>hot</b> <b>pipe</b> and cauterized his wound, stopping the bleeding and ultimately surviving the trap. John catches up with Gordon and makes him his next apprentice, a fact which he hides from his other accomplices. Flashbacks from Saw III show that Amanda kidnapped Adam and later returned to suffocate him as an act of [...] "mercy killing".|$|E
