For {{a long time}} chemists searched for eka-tantalum as an element with similar chemical properties to tantalum, making a discovery of protactinium nearly impossible.

5|$|Callisto's {{battered}} surface lies {{on top of}} a cold, stiff, and icy lithosphere that {{is between}} 80 and 150km thick. A salty ocean 150200km deep may lie beneath the crust, indicated by studies of the magnetic fields around Jupiter and its moons. It was found that Callisto responds to Jupiter's varying background magnetic field like a perfectly conducting sphere; that is, the field cannot penetrate inside Callisto, suggesting a layer of highly conductive fluid within it with a thickness of at least 10km. The <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ocean is more likely if water contains a small amount of ammonia or other antifreeze, up to 5% by weight. In this case the water+ice layer can be as thick as 250300km. Failing an ocean, the icy lithosphere may be somewhat thicker, up to about 300km.|$|E
5|$|During {{the run-up}} to the 2006 Swedish general election, Reinfeldt was {{subjected}} to a smear campaign. Mats Lindström, a staff member in the Social Democratic Party headquarters, admitted to sending e-mails accusing Reinfeldt of tax fraud, false financial declarations and only attaining his position because of his father's influence. The IP address used in the e-mails was traced to the Social Democratic Party headquarters. Social Democratic Party Secretary Marita Ulvskog apologized and said that such behavior was completely unacceptable. A short time after the e-mail campaign, images that depicted Reinfeldt and the Moderate Party in an unflattering light were spread internally within the Social Democratic Party and subsequently leaked to the media. Social Democratic Party spokeswoman Carina Persson confirmed that the material came from the Social Democratic Youth League, but denied the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> official smear campaign and stated that the material was not meant to be released or spread to a wider audience.|$|E

5|$|Gossip soon {{spread of}} the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> illegitimate child.

Flora Fraser believes the rumours that Sophia had a child, but has questioned whether the child was fathered by Garth, or Sophia's brother the Duke of Cumberland. Historians further write that the child, baptised Thomas Garth like his father, was raised by his father in Weymouth, where his mother would visit him occasionally. In 1828 he apparently tried to blackmail the royal family with certain incriminating documents from his father about his supposed parents' relationship, though this ended in failure.|$|E

5|$|Historians have {{disagreed}} {{about its}} age, and the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> older {{church on the}} same site. The tower has been dated by its architecture to between 1230 and 1240, but other historians question this date and suggest the tower and {{the body of the}} church both date to the 14thcentury. The porch appears to be a 17thcentury addition. There is a tomb of Margaret deCamois in the nave. It has been suggested that its location there, rather than the chancel as would be expected for the family of the lord of the manor (which her surname suggests she was), may indicate that the church was built on the site of an earlier, smaller, church and the tomb was in the chancel of that church. Local historian Roger Chatterton-Newman disagrees, saying there would be no need for a church on the site any earlier.|$|E
5|$|In 631 Anna was {{probably}} at the Suffolk village of Exning, an important settlement with royal connections, and, {{according to the}} Liber Eliensis, the birthplace of his daughter Æthelthryth. By tradition, Æthelthryth {{is said to have}} been baptised at Exning in a pool known as St Mindred's Well. Exning was an important place strategically, as it stood just on the East Anglian side of the Devil's Dyke, a major earthwork stretching between the Fen edge and the headwaters of the River Stour, built at an earlier date to defend the East Anglian region from attack. An early Anglo-Saxon cemetery discovered there suggests the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> important site nearby, possibly a royal estate or regio.|$|E
5|$|Nansen {{first began}} to {{consider}} the possibility of reaching the North Pole by using the natural drift of the polar ice when, in 1884, he read the theories of Henrik Mohn, the distinguished Norwegian meteorologist. Artifacts found on the Greenland coast had been identified as coming from the lost US Arctic exploration vessel Jeannette, which had been crushed and sunk in June 1881 {{on the opposite side of}} the Arctic Ocean, off the Siberian coast. Mohn surmised that the location of the artefacts indicated the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ocean current, flowing from east to west all the way across the polar sea, possibly over the pole itself. A strong enough ship might therefore enter the frozen Siberian sea, and drift to the Greenland coast via the pole.|$|E

50|$|Conserved {{currents}} play {{an extremely}} important role in theoretical physics, because Noether's theorem connects the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> conserved current to the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> symmetry <b>of</b> some quantity in the system under study. In practical terms, all conserved currents are the Noether currents, as the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> conserved current implies the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> symmetry.

5|$|Scholarly {{theories}} {{note the}} similarities between the táltos of Hungarian folklore and Siberian shamans, but the existence of shamans among the ancient Magyars cannot be proven. Many elements of the Hungarian religious vocabulary, including boszorkány ("witch"), elbűvöl ("to charm"), and the ancient Hungarian word for holy (igy or egy), are of Turkic origin. Many of these loanwords were adopted into their Christian vocabulary: búcsú (indulgence), bűn (sin), gyón (confess), isten (god), and ördög (devil). According to Gyula László, a Hungarian children's verse that refers to a fife, a drum, and a reed violin preserves the memory of a pagan ritual for expelling harmful spirits by raising great noise. The refrain of another children's verse, which mentions three days of the week in reverse order, may have preserved an ancient belief in the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> afterlife world where everything is upside-down.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} the <b>existence</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> actual {{infinity}} was an important shared concern within the realms of mathematics, philosophy and religion. Preserving the orthodoxy {{of the relationship between}} God and mathematics, although not in the same form as held by his critics, was long a concern of Cantor's. He directly addressed this intersection between these disciplines in the introduction to his Grundlagen einer allgemeinen Mannigfaltigkeitslehre, where he stressed the connection between his view of the infinite and the philosophical one. To Cantor, his mathematical views were intrinsically linked to their philosophical and theological implications – he identified the Absolute Infinite with God, and he considered his work on transfinite numbers to have been directly communicated to him by God, who had chosen Cantor to reveal them to the world.|$|E
