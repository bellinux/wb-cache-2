40|$|ABSTRACT The present study, {{conducted}} in Dharwad city (Karnataka), {{examined the relationship}} between self-esteem and adjustment among children with reading and writing difficulties. A total sample of 418 children studying in grade six in different schools were selected based on their previous academic performance of the class-tests and teacher’s rating. They were further tested on Bai’s reading and writing tests in Kannada. About 180 children who were <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be <b>having</b> reading difficulty and 114 children who were <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be <b>having</b> writing difficulty in were selected for further testing on self-esteem and adjustment along with a group of normal children (165 in reading and 240 in writing) for comparison purpose. Analysis revealed that 93 % of academically low achieving children (based on the class records and teacher rating) were <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be <b>having</b> reading difficulty while 58 % had writing difficulty. Among academically high/normal achieving children, 77 % were <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be normal in reading while 13 % were <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be <b>having</b> reading difficulty. In writing 87 % of the high/normal achieving students were normal and 5 % were <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be <b>having</b> difficulty. Children with reading and writing difficulties obtained significantly low score in self-esteem and adjustment when compared to normal children. Children having reading and writing difficulty had poor scores on general and academic aspects of self-esteem and on peers and teachers related areas of adjustment. However, the differences between the groups were <b>found</b> <b>to</b> be low suggesting that suitable remedial / intervention programmes may bring the children with difficulty on par with normal children...|$|R
