5000|$|The Barberton <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> (Smaug barbertonensis), Waterberg <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> (Smaug breyeri [...] ), Zoutpansberg <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> (Smaug depressus), Mozambique <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> (Smaug mossambicus), and the regal <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> (Smaug regius) were {{formerly}} considered subspecies of Warren’s <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard.</b>|$|R
50|$|Specimens labeled as Transvaal <b>girdled</b> <b>lizards</b> are {{exported}} from Mozambique. Most {{individuals are}} not C. vittifer, {{but in fact}} Limpopo <b>girdled</b> <b>lizards</b> (Cordylus jonesii). The Limpopo <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> can be quickly distinguished from C. vittifer by its rounded, not flattened, body. The Limpopo <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> also lacks the elongate first row of dorsal scales.|$|R
50|$|The Transvaal <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> {{is closely}} related to Machadoe’s <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> (Cordylus machadoi) from northwestern Namibia. Both species have an {{elongate}} first row of dorsal scales. Machadoe’s <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> is uniform yellow brown above and paler below. The head is dark brown with pale lips. The pale vertebral stripe found in the Transvaal <b>Girdled</b> <b>Lizard</b> is not present.|$|R
50|$|The Limpopo <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> is {{sometimes}} {{classified as a}} subspecies of the tropical <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> (Cordylus tropidosternum). When both species are held together, the Limpopo <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> has a noticeably shorter snout. The nostril pierces {{the center of the}} nasal scale (the lower posterior corner of the nasal in C. tropidosternum). Scales on the throat and belly of Limpopo <b>girdled</b> <b>lizards</b> are smooth instead of keeled. Limpopo <b>girdled</b> <b>lizards</b> are exported from Mozambique for the pet trade, where they are often mislabeled as Cordylus vittifer. They make hardy captives, feeding on insects and other small arthropods.|$|R
5000|$|Tropical <b>girdled</b> <b>lizards</b> {{are almost}} {{identical}} to the Limpopo <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> (Cordylus jonesii [...] ) and the Ukinga <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> (Cordylus ukingensis). Limpopo <b>girdled</b> <b>lizards</b> have smooth scales on the throat and belly (C. tropidosternum has keeled scales) and its nostril is {{in the center of}} the nasal scale (the nostril of C. tropidosternum is positioned in the lower posterior corner of the nasal scale). The Ukinga <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> has distinctive white lips, a small ridge over each eye (supraocular ridge), and the loreal scale is fused with the preocular scale (they are separate in C. tropidosternum and C. jonesii [...] ).|$|R
5000|$|Zoutpansberg <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> (Smaug depressus) is {{a species}} of the genus Smaug. This species is only found on and around the Soutpansberg in South Africa and was before {{considered}} a subspecies of Warren's <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard.</b> Zoutpansberg <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard's</b> grow to a length up to 16 centimeters.|$|R
50|$|The Ukinga <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> (Cordylus ukingensis) is {{a poorly}} known species of <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> from central Tanzania. They are {{rupicolous}} (rock-dwelling) and feed on small arthropods.|$|R
5000|$|Namazonurus campbelli (Campbell's <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard)</b> is {{a species}} of lizard in the family Cordylidae, is a small, <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> endemic to Namibia. It is often mistaken for the more common Herero <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> Namazonurus pustulatus as they both are similar in size and have {{flattened}} bodies. It lives in rock crevices and cracks on dry mountain slopes ...|$|R
50|$|Ukinga <b>girdled</b> <b>lizards</b> have {{recently}} been exported from Tanzania for the pet trade. They are commonly labeled, along with the tropical <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard,</b> as the armadillo lizard.|$|R
50|$|Zimbabwe <b>girdled</b> <b>lizards</b> are {{exported}} from Mozambique for the pet trade. Zimbabwe <b>girdled</b> <b>lizards</b> remain skittish {{in captivity}} and require numerous hiding places constructed with stacked rocks.|$|R
50|$|The Transvaal <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard,</b> Cordylus vittifer, {{is a very}} {{flattened}} <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> from northeastern South Africa, Swaziland, and southeastern Botswana. It prefers rock outcrops in {{open grassland}} and feeds on small arthropods, especially beetles.|$|R
50|$|The {{tropical}} <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> is exported from Tanzania and Mozambique for the pet trade {{where it}} is {{commonly referred to as}} the “armadillo lizard” or “forest armadillo lizard or “Jones's armadillo lizard”. Tropical <b>girdled</b> <b>lizards</b> are not flattened like the true armadillo Lizard (Cordylus cataphractus) and do not grasp their tail and roll into a ball for defense. With gentle handling and plenty of hiding places, tropical <b>girdled</b> <b>lizards</b> become excellent, long-lived pets and can be trained to accept food from their owner’s hand.|$|R
50|$|The Mozambique <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> is {{also called}} the Gorongosa <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> or Cordylus gorongosa (not a valid taxon name). Individuals are {{exported}} through Mozambique for the pet trade. They eat {{a wide variety of}} small insects (especially beetles and grasshoppers), millipedes, spiders, and occasional small vertebrates.|$|R

50|$|The Mozambique <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> or flame-bellied {{armadillo}} lizard (Smaug mossambicus) is a large, flattened, <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> {{found in}} the Gorongosa Mountains in Mozambique and low elevations in the Chimanimani Mountains at the border of Zimbabwe and Mozambique. It lives in rock outcrops in grasslands and dry, wooded mountain slopes.|$|R
50|$|An {{isolated}} {{population of}} the Rhodesian <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> (Cordylus rhodesianus) from granite outcrops in montane grassland of northern Malawi was recently redescribed as Cordylus nyikae. Unlike the Rhodesian <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard,</b> the head shields of this species are very rugose, the nostrils are pierced in the lower posterior corner of the nasal scales, and the dorsals {{do not have a}} serrated posterior margin. The dorsal coloration is dark brown to gray-brown with lighter spots. The tail and upper lips are light brown. The belly is buff. Its common name is Nyika <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard.</b>|$|R
50|$|Machadoe's <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> (Cordylus machadoi) is a {{flattened}} <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> from southwestern Angola and northwestern Namibia. They are found as solitary individuals or in pairs on rock outcrops in arid savannah. It can be identified, along with Cordylus vittifer, by have an elongate first row of dorsal scales. Machadoe’s <b>girdled</b> <b>lizard</b> is uniform yellow brown above and paler below. The head is dark brown with pale lips. The pale vertebral stripe {{found in the}} Cordylus vittifer is not present. Adults reach 78 mm in length from snout to vent.|$|R

5000|$|Pseudocordylus is a genus {{of small}} to large <b>girdled</b> <b>lizards</b> from South Africa, {{commonly}} known as crag lizards. Six species of Pseudocordylus are known; they are distinguished from <b>girdled</b> <b>lizards</b> of the genus Cordylus {{by the presence of}} granular scales on the back instead of osteoderms. However, recent molecular data places Pseudocordylus within Cordylus.http://research.amnh.org/scicomp/pdfs/Frost_etal2001a.pdf ...|$|R
