5|$|A {{pandemic}} is {{a worldwide}} epidemic. The 1918 flu pandemic, which lasted until 1919, was a category 5 <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemic</b> {{caused by an}} unusually severe and deadly influenza A virus. The victims were often healthy young adults, in contrast to most influenza outbreaks, which predominantly affect juvenile, elderly, or otherwise-weakened patients. Older estimates say it killed 40–50million people, while more recent research suggests {{that it may have}} killed as many as 100million people, or 5% of the world's population in 1918.|$|E
5|$|A study – {{conducted}} by He et al. – used a mechanistic modelling approach {{to study the}} three waves of the 1918 <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemic.</b> They tried to study the factors that underlie variability in temporal patterns, and the patterns of mortality and morbidity. Their analysis suggests that temporal variations in transmission rate provide the best explanation and the variation in transmission required to generate these three waves is within biologically plausible values.|$|E

5|$|Another {{study by}} He et al. used a simple {{epidemic}} model, to incorporate three factors including school opening and closing, temperature changes {{over the course}} of the outbreak, and human behavioral changes in response to the outbreak to infer the cause of the three waves of the 1918 <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemic.</b> Their modelling results showed that all three factors are important but human behavioral responses showed the largest effects.|$|E
5|$|In December 1891, May {{was engaged}} to her second cousin once removed, Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, the eldest son of the Prince of Wales.

He formally moved to Calcutta in 1906 after the announcement of the Partition of Bengal. Age 28, he had married 14-year-old Mrinalini, daughter of Bhupal Chandra Bose, a senior official in government service, when he visited Calcutta in 1901. Mrinalini died in December 1918 during the <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemic.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Influenza</b> <b>{{pandemic}}s</b> show {{a history}} of recurrence. In the 20 th century, three <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemics</b> occurred. The swine flu is now a reality, the first pandemic of the 21 st century. Among the <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemics</b> of the 20 th century, the Spanish flu was the most lethal, and terrifying due to recurring waves {{and the fact that}} the lethality was highest among young and healthy adults. Information about historical pandemics is of great value, to be able to prepare for future pandemics. In this study we focus on two areas: An investigation of historical autopsy data from Ullevål hospital in Oslo from the period of the Spanish flu, as well as an investigation of available literature on several aspects of <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemics.</b> The data from Ullevål hospital verifies the results from earlier studies of the Spanish flu in Norway, regarding age distribution and the pattern of recurring waves. The intention of the literature investigation is both to compare the data from the Ullevål hospital with other studies of the Spanish flu, as well as to discuss the available information from historical <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemics</b> in general. We are focusing on lethality, on cause of death, on the properties of the influenza virus in general, on viral dynamics, on modeling pandemic spread, on intervention strategies etc. The conclusion of the literature investigation is that available information is not sufficient to explain all properties of and differences between historical pandemics. All data about historical pandemics as well as the ongoing swine flu pandemic, could be valuable...|$|R

5|$|In general, avian {{influenza}} {{is a disease}} of birds caused by bird-specific influenza A virus that is not normally transferred to people; however, people in contact with live poultry are at the greatest risk of becoming infected with the virus and this is of particular concern {{in areas such as}} Southeast Asia, where the disease is endemic in the wild bird population and domestic poultry can become infected. The virus possibly could mutate to become highly virulent and infectious in humans and cause an <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemic.</b>|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} explanations for the high mortality rate of the 1918 <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemic.</b> Some {{research suggests that the}} specific variant of the virus had an unusually aggressive nature. One group of researchers recovered the original virus from the bodies of frozen victims, and found that transfection in animals caused a rapid progressive respiratory failure and death through a cytokine storm (overreaction of the body's immune system). It was then postulated that the strong immune reactions of young adults ravaged the body, whereas the weaker immune systems of children and middle-aged adults resulted in fewer deaths among those groups.|$|E
5|$|In fact, Puccini was {{at first}} less than {{enthusiastic}} about the idea for this comic opera– Florence as a setting did not appeal to him, and he feared the public would have {{little interest in the}} subject. However, he soon became interested, and did some work on the piece even while composing Suor Angelica. The religious-themed opera was completed in September 1917, and Puccini turned his full attention to Gianni Schicchi, although the war news and the 1918 <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemic,</b> in which Puccini lost a sister, distracted him from his work. The first draft was completed on 20 April 1918, and Puccini continued to refine and orchestrate it through the summer of 1918.|$|E
40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) {{mortality}} {{declined in}} the northern hemisphere over the last 200 years, but peaked during the Russian (1889) and the Spanish (1918) <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemics.</b> We studied {{the impact of these}} two pandemics on TB mortality. We retrieved historic data from mortality registers for the city of Bern and countrywide for Switzerland. We used Poisson regression models to quantify the excess pulmonary TB (PTB) mortality attributable to influenza. Yearly PTB mortality rates increased during both <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemics.</b> Monthly <b>influenza</b> and PTB mortality rates peaked during winter and early spring. In Bern, for an increase of 100 influenza deaths (per 100, 000 population) monthly PTB mortality rates increased by a factor of 1. 5 (95 %Cl 1. 4 - 1. 6, p< 0. 001) during the Russian, and 3. 6 (95 %Cl 0. 7 - 18. 0, p = 0. 13) during the Spanish pandemic. Nationally, the factor was 2. 0 (95 %Cl 1. 8 - 2. 2, p< 0. 001) and 1. 5 (95 %Cl 1. 1 - 1. 9, p = 0. 004), respectively. We did not observe any excess cancer or extrapulmonary TB mortality (as a negative control) during the <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemics.</b> We demonstrate excess PTB mortality during historic <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemics</b> in Switzerland, which supports a role for influenza vaccination in PTB patients in high TB incidence countries...|$|R

Therefore, HA is an attractive target for developing anti-IAV drugs and vaccines. Here we have reviewed the recent progress in study of conformational changes of HA during viral fusion process and development of HA-based antiviral therapeutics and vaccines.|$|R
5|$|Formby's {{health was}} further damaged in the <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemic</b> of 1918, {{during which he}} {{contracted}} the disease while appearing at the Manchester Hippodrome {{and was unable to}} work for a month. He was taken ill during the runs of pantomimes in both 1918 and 1919, was forced to rest for three months in 1919, and collapsed on stage during a performance in Newcastle upon Tyne in the 1920–21 pantomime season. Formby was advised by doctors to emigrate to South Africa for the benefit of his health, but he preferred to stay in Britain, with his wife and children, and continued to work. During his performances his wife would wait in the wings with ice for him to suck to stop internal bleeding, and an oxygen tent was present in the stage wings ready for emergencies.|$|E
5|$|Hunter {{was born}} in Rothesay, at 7 Tower Street, on the Isle of Bute. The date was 7 August 1877. He was the {{youngest}} child of five, born to William and Jeanie (née Stewart) Hunter. George, as he was then known, showed an aptitude for drawing when very young {{and when he was}} about thirteen, his mother arranged for him to have painting lessons with a lady acquaintance. In February 1892, Hunter's elder sister Catherine died. Shortly after, in March, another elder sibling, James, also died. Both were in their early twenties. It is thought they may have been victims of an <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemic.</b> William, the father, and Jeanie, seem already to have contemplated emigrating, because a home had been sold. Evidently, the tragic deaths sealed the matter, and the remaining family departed for California via New York on 1 September 1892, aboard the SS Ethiopia.|$|E

Playing against the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League (NHL), the series was abandoned tied at two wins apiece, because of the Spanish <b>Influenza</b> <b>pandemic.</b> Montreal could not continue the series because one of their players, Joe Hall, was severely ill with influenza; however, the Metropolitans {{did not wish to}} accept the Cup by default.

5|$|Serving as {{the convoy}} {{flagship}} for Convoy HX-50, Otranto departed New York on 25 September. Six days later, {{on the evening}} of 1 October, the ship accidentally rammed the French fishing schooner Croisine off Newfoundland while the latter was returning home to St. Malo with a full load of cod. The fishing boat passed down the liner's port side and its masts destroyed some of the liner's lifeboats on that side. Captain Ernest Davidson, who was also commodore of the convoy, ordered the convoy to continue while Otranto stopped to rescue the 37 survivors. The derelict Croisine was now a menace to navigation and Davidson ordered his gun crews to sink her later that evening. The liner caught back up with the convoy by daybreak. The following day, the first death from the <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemic</b> occurred and the soldier was buried at sea. Only one other flu death aboard Otranto is recorded, but others may have occurred before she met her end.|$|E
5|$|Logan {{remained}} the Military Administrator and British representative to Samoa {{until the end}} of the war. At the time of its seizure, Samoa was politically stable and its economy was based on its plantations which were mainly German owned. Apart from replacing most of the key officials, who were Germans, with New Zealanders, he largely followed existing policies but over time made a series of misjudgements. The German-owned plantations were allowed to continue to operate but only to trade with neutral or Allied countries. By 1916, most of the larger plantations were seized and placed into receivership when it was discovered that they were still trading with German companies. This placed considerable financial stress on the economy. Not long into Logan's administration, an uprising of Chinese labourers, who complained about their rations, had to be suppressed. He continued to restrict their civil liberties and over time most were repatriated back to China. By not implementing quarantine procedures, he significantly mishandled the arrival of the <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemic</b> in November 1918, which resulted in over 7,500 deaths. This represented over 20% of Samoa's population at the time. In the meantime, neighbouring American Samoa was quarantined by its Governor, John Martin Poyer, and consequently had no influenza deaths.|$|E

40|$|Previous <b>influenza</b> <b>{{pandemic}}s</b> {{are usually}} invoked in pandemic preparedness planning without a thorough {{analysis of the}} events surrounding them, {{what has been called}} the ‘configuration’ of epidemics. Historic pandemics are instead used to contrast them to the novelty of the coming imagined plague or as fear of a ghost-like repetition of the past. This view of pandemics is guided by a biomedical framework that is ahistorical and reductionist. The meaning of ‘pandemic’ influenza is in fact highly ambiguous in its partitioning of <b>pandemic</b> and seasonal <b>influenza.</b> The past 200  years of influenza epidemics in Sweden are examined with a special focus on key social structures—households, schools, transportations and the military. These are shown to have influenced the progression of <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemics.</b> Prevailing beliefs around <b>influenza</b> <b>pandemics</b> have also profoundly influenced intervention strategies. Measuring long-term trends in pandemic severity is problematic because pandemics are non-linear events where the conditions surrounding them constantly change. However, in a linearised view, the Spanish flu can be seen to represent a historical turning point and the H 1 N 1 2009 pandemic not as an outlier, but following a 100 -year trend of decreasing severity. Integrating seasonal and <b>pandemic</b> <b>influenza,</b> and adopting an ecosocial stance can deepen our understanding and bring the ghost-like pandemic past to life.
