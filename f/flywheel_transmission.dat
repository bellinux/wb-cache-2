5000|$|All Daimler {{models from}} 1930 to the 1950s used these gearboxes, which were {{introduced}} on their Daimler Double Six and soon used {{in all their}} vehicles. The chairman reported to the shareholders at their Annual General Meeting in November 1933 [...] "The Daimler Fluid <b>Flywheel</b> <b>Transmission</b> now has three years of success behind it and more than 11,000 vehicles, ranging from 10 h.p. passenger cars to double-deck omnibuses, aggregating over 160,000 h.p., incorporate this transmission ... {{it has yet to}} be proved that any other system offers all the advantages of the Daimler Fluid <b>Flywheel</b> <b>Transmission.</b> Our Daimler, Lanchester and BSA cars remain what we set out to make them - the aristocrats of their class and type ... We have also received numerous inquiries from overseas markets. (Applause)".|$|E

2500|$|... 1932 September, {{directors}} announce BSA Cycles' fourth {{attempt to}} enter the car trade with a 10hp 4-seater with Daimler fluid <b>flywheel</b> and self-changing <b>transmission</b> to be produced early in the new year. Another car {{to be placed on}} the market was a four-cylinder three-wheeler with an engine identical in essential details with that of the open four-seater four-wheeler car.|$|R
5000|$|The later engines were large. Arthur Roberts {{reported}} that Hartford Mill was powered by an 1800 hp twin-tandem compound engine by Urmson and Thompson, built in 1907. It was steamed at 160 psi at 68 rpm. It had a 5 ft stroke driving a 24 ft <b>flywheel.</b> The <b>transmission</b> method was a rope drive using 40 ropes. The engine was {{reputed to be}} the only twin-tandem that Urmson & Thompson built. It had two 30" [...] diameter HP (high-pressure) cylinders at the rear, and two 60" [...] LP (low-pressure) cylinders in front. There were Corliss valves on all cylinders. The air pumps were driven from each crosshead. There was a Whitehead governor. The engine cost £5400 and the three boilers cost £1900.|$|R
50|$|The usual {{design of}} damper on the {{crankshaft}} {{consists of a}} thin band of rubber between {{the hub of the}} pulley and the outer rim. This device, often called a harmonic damper, is located {{on the other end of}} the crankshaft opposite of where the <b>flywheel</b> and the <b>transmission</b> is. An alternative design is the centrifugal pendulum absorber which is used to reduce the internal combustion engine's torsional vibrations on a few modern cars.|$|R
50|$|Power was {{delivered}} to the rear wheels through a Fluid <b>flywheel</b> <b>transmission</b> system, licensed under Vulcan-Sinclair and Daimler patents, that Daimler had introduced in all its vehicles {{at the beginning of}} the decade. The epicyclic preselector gearbox allowed a clear flat floor for driver and front seat passenger.|$|E
50|$|The Burney {{engine was}} a side-valve of 81mm bore and 96mm stroke, with an {{external}} 11 inch <b>flywheel.</b> <b>Transmission</b> was by a three speed Sturmey-Archer countershaft gearbox with kick starter. It {{had a hand}} controlled clutch, and all chain transmission. It had aluminium guards over {{the front and rear}} chain and an aluminium silencer.|$|E
50|$|While small single-piston engines can {{commonly}} be laid on a {{table for}} repair, a large engine is normally meant to be supported from its engine mounts or from the <b>flywheel</b> <b>transmission</b> case mounts, and fragile components such as oil pans and valve covers would be crushed if the large engine were placed on a flat surface.|$|E
50|$|In the {{automobile}} industry, {{as chairman of}} both Birmingham Small Arms Company and its wholly owned subsidiary The Daimler Company, he personally brought about {{the introduction of the}} Knight sleeve-valve engine and its acquisition by Daimler, and the incorporation of the fluid <b>flywheel</b> and epicyclic <b>transmission</b> system throughout Daimler's full range of vehicles. He shared his electrical engineering background with Daimler's managing director, American-born Percy Martin. Together they took Daimler to its greatest success, with Manville serving on its board for 28 years, from 1905 until his death in 1933.|$|R
40|$|The {{power train}} {{performance}} of load leveled electric vehicles {{can be compared}} with that of nonload leveled systems by use of a simple mathematical model. This method of measurement involves a number of parameters including the degree of load leveling and regeneration, the flywheel mechanical to electrical energy fraction, and efficiencies of the motor, generator, <b>flywheel,</b> and <b>transmission.</b> Basic efficiency terms are defined and representative comparisons of a variety of systems are presented. Results of the study indicate that mechanical transfer of energy {{into and out of the}} flywheel is more advantageous than electrical transfer. An optimum degree of load leveling may be achieved in terms of the driving cycle, battery characteristics, mode of mechanization, and the efficiency of the components. For state of the art mechanically coupled flyheel systems, load leveling losses can be held to a reasonable 10 %; electrically coupled systems can have losses that are up to six times larger. Propulsion system efficiencies for mechanically coupled flywheel systems are predicted to be approximately the 60 % achieved on conventional nonload leveled systems...|$|R
50|$|The World of Outlaws (WoO) is a {{division}} of winged sprint cars that run all over the United States and have a few events in Canada. The cars have 15 in wide right rear tire and a 410 cubic inch engine with mechanical fuel injection. These sprint cars have no battery or a starter in them, necessitating a push start by a quad or truck. They also do not have <b>flywheels,</b> clutches or <b>transmissions,</b> but the direct drive system can be engaged or disengaged from the cockpit. This is done both for weight reasons and tradition. Another tradition the WoO has for their A-main (the last race of the event) {{is to have the}} cars line up four wide just before starting the race.|$|R
5000|$|The DK400 was {{the last}} new Daimler model to use the company's {{preselector}} gearbox with fluid <b>flywheel</b> <b>transmission</b> introduced in 1930. A major change in gearing, however, saw the direct-drive top gear replaced by a direct-drive third and an overdrive top. This, intended to improve the car's ability to cruise at high speed with its large engine, could lead to failure because the transmission could not always cope with the torque available from an engine capable of producing [...] at 3,000 rpm.|$|E
40|$|In current non-electrified rail systems {{there is}} a {{significant}} loss of energy during vehicle braking. The aim of this research has been to investigate the potential benefits of introducing onboard regenerative braking systems to rail vehicles. An overview of energy saving measures proposed within the rail industry is presented along with a review of different energy storage devices and systems developed for both rail and automotive applications. Advanced flywheels have been identified as a candidate energy storage device for rail applications, combining high specific power and energy. In order to assess the potential benefits of energy storage systems in rail vehicles, a computational model of a conventional regional diesel train has been developed. This has been used to define a base level of vehicle performance, and to investigate the effects of energy efficient control strategies focussing on the application of coasting prior to braking. The impact of these measures on both the requirements of an energy storage system and the potential benefits of a hybrid train have been assessed. A detailed study of a range of existing and novel mechanical flywheel transmissions has been performed. The interaction between the <b>flywheel,</b> <b>transmission</b> and vehicle is investigated using a novel application-independent analysis method which has been developed to characterise and compare the performance of different systems. The results of this analysis produce general ‘design tools’ for each <b>flywheel</b> <b>transmission</b> configuration, allowing appropriate system configurations and parameters to be identified for a particular application. More detailed computational models of the best performing systems have been developed and integrated with the conventional regional diesel train model. The performance of proposed flywheel hybrid regional trains has been assessed using realistic component losses and journey profiles, and the fuel saving relative to a conventional train quantified for a range of energy storage capacities and power-train control strategies.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the analysis, modeling, and simulation {{of an electric}} vehicle (EV) focused on developing a test bench for reproducing EV dynamics. The EV test bench is composed of an induction motor (IM) drive, which is directly coupled to a dc machine and to an inertial <b>flywheel</b> through a <b>transmission</b> system with bands. The inertial flywheel and the DC machine reproduce the dynamic and forces acting on the EV. A methodology is proposed to design EV test bench to study the EV behavior close to the real test conditions. The EV forces and DC machine analysis can define the different conditions of the EV operation. The modeling and simulation are developed in MATLAB/Simulink, the test bench implemented is controlled by a DSP. Finally, simulation and experimental obtained results can validate {{the operation of the}} test bench emulator...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{rotating}} inertias {{within the}} engine and transmission, the response of a vehicle during large engine speed transients may appear reluctant or even counteracting. Reminiscent of comparable behaviour in aircraft jet-propulsion, this phenomenon is {{also referred to as}} jet-start. To overcome this behaviour, a CVT powertrain is augmented with a plenetary gear set and a compact steel <b>flywheel.</b> The new <b>transmission</b> seamlessly combines two contradictory features: the driveability in terms of the pedal-to-wheel response is greatly improved and a large leap towards optimal fuel economy can be made. This is achieved by cruising the vehicle at extremely low engine speeds, using the large ratiocoverage of the CVT. The flywheel acts as a 2 ̆ 2 peak shaver 2 ̆ 2 during speed shifts: it delivers power during engine acceleration and absorbs kinetic energy during engine decelerations. In this paper, system dynamics and control aspects of the new powertrain are discussed...|$|R
50|$|GM {{launched}} a hybrid {{version of the}} Silverado/Sierra in 2004, becoming the first ever GM hybrid passenger vehicle. Known within GM as the Parallel Hybrid Truck or PHT it is not actually a parallel hybrid by the current definition, but a type of micro hybrid design. The electric motor housed within the <b>transmission</b> <b>flywheel</b> housing, serves only to provide engine cranking/starting, battery charging, and powering accessories. The engine automatically shuts down as the truck {{comes to a stop}} and uses 42 Volt electric power to the starter/generator unit to restart the engine as the brake pedal is released. Besides the typical 12 V automotive battery the PHT uses three additional 12 V valve regulated lead acid (VRLA) batteries mounted under the rear seat to store and provide power. The truck uses a 5.3 L Vortec 5300 V8 for primary propulsion power. These trucks were also purchased back from customers for more than what they were worth in the late 2000s.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Clutch {{system is}} among the main systems inside a vehicle. Clutch is a {{mechanical}} device located between a vehicle engine and its transmission and provides mechanical coupling between the engine and transmission input shaft. Clutch system comprise of flywheel, clutch disc plate and friction material, pressure plate, clutch cover, diaphragm spring and the linkage necessary to operate the clutch. The clutch engages the transmission gradually by allowing {{a certain amount of}} slippage between the <b>flywheel</b> and the <b>transmission</b> input shaft. However, the slipping mechanism of the clutch generates heat energy due to friction between the clutch disc and the flywheel. At high sliding velocity, excessive frictional heat is generated which lead to high temperature rise at the clutch disc surface, and this causes thermo-mechanical problems such as thermal deformations and thermo-elastic instability which can lead to thermal cracking, wear and other mode of failure of the clutch disc component. In this project, the modeling of clutch is done in detailed using modeling software. After that the FEM analysis is done for sintered iron friction material. The stresses & deformation obtained for this friction material is then compared to analysis software result. The analysis is done for worn out friction disc. Index Terms — Coefficient of friction, von-misses stress, young’s modulus and poisons ratio...|$|R
40|$|The human knee absorbs {{more energy}} than it expends in level ground walking. For this reason {{it would be useful}} if the {{actuation}} system of a wearable robot for lower limbs was able to recover energy thus improving portability. Presently, we recognize three promising technologies with energy recovery capabilities already available in the literature: the Series Elastic Actuator (SEA), the Clutchable Series Elastic Actuator (C-SEA), and the <b>flywheel</b> Infinitely Variable <b>Transmission</b> (F-IVT) actuator. In this paper, a simulation model based comparison of the performance of these actuators is presented. The focus is on two performance indexes: the energy consumed by the electric motor per gait and the peak torque/power requested to the electric motor. Both quantities are related to the portability of the device: the former affects the size of the batteries for a given desired range; the latter affects the size and the weight of the electric motor. The results show that, besides some well-explained limitations of the presented methodology, the C-SEA is the most energy efficient whereas the F-IVT allows cutting down the motor torque/peak power strongly. The analysis also leads to defining how it is possible to improve the F-IVT to achieve a reduction of the energy consumption...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} project is to determine a passenger vehicles' acceleration and top speed change {{in response to the}} change in the ratio of the final drive gearing coefficient. To accomplish this, the following tasks had to be completed: analysis of the transmission types, their construction and the operation of the final drive assembly, performing a numerical analysis and comparing it to dynamic real world test results using a “BMW (E 36) 318 is” as the test subject. The car chosen for {{this research}} is a “BMW (E 36) 318 is” due to its classical arrangement comprised of a front mounted four cylinder petrol engine and rear wheel drive. The analysis of the final drive gearing in such arrangement is easier, due to the transmission being separate from the rear mounted differential assembly. By changing the differential housings which have different internal gearing, their effect on the vehicle's acceleration and top speed could be observed and compared to the calculations of expected values. The research was started by gathering and analyzing material about the power delivery chain in the manual transmission vehicle model to develop a familiarity with the components: <b>flywheel,</b> clutch, <b>transmission</b> and integrated subframe final drive assembly. In regards to the available final drive assemblies, four differential housings were chosen with the following internal gearing configurations to conduct this study: 2. 79 : 1 – the lowest one, available from the factory in the diesel powered vehicles known for their high torque. 3. 15 : 1 – the gear set mostly found in the high powered petrol engine cars. 3. 45 : 1 – the gear set that came standard with the chosen test vehicle. 4. 10 : 1 – the gear set used for the least powerful petrol engines, usually coupled with automatic transmissions. Changing the differential therefore changes the gearing of the final drive assembly and provides a change in vehicle dynamics. After conducting the gathering and analysis of the available information from the data-sheets and literal documentation, practical tests were conducted using a “DL 1 ” data collection tool to capture the information about the response of the car with all four aforementioned differentials. Using the “Analysis V 8 ” software with the said tool, the top speed and acceleration for each gear and all four differentials were determined, alongside the engine RPM for 50 km/h and 90 km/h for different gears. Finally the theoretical calculations for the top speed at max engine in every gear were calculated. They were correlated with the observed values for our measurements, including the top RPM for each gear and the engine RPM for 50 km/h in 3 'rd gear, 50 km/h and 90 km/h in 4 th gear, 90 km/h in 5 th gear. The observations conclude that increasing the ratio of the gear set in the differential leads to a quicker accelerating vehicle, but it negatively affects the comfort and fuel consumption. The best gear set ratio for fuel economy and acceleration for our test vehicle was determined to be the factory 3. 45 : 1 although with increased driving speed (above 90 km/h) fuel economy and comfort are reduced. For users who spend most of their commute at highway speeds, it would be recommended to switch their final drive assembly to the one with the ratio of 2. 79 : 1 for increased comfort and decreased fuel consumption. The conducted research is unique in terms of applicability. A user could tailor their car to their needs in regard to the expected driving conditions based on this research. Also- the calculated and observed data have a very close correlation, therefore a calculated final drive ratio selection could be trusted to have the expected result on the vehicle...|$|R
