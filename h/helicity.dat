5|$|The high {{temperatures}} and dew points created moderate instability across the outbreak area. CAPE values, a {{measurement of the}} level of tropospheric instability, were over 1000J/kg, and <b>helicity</b> levels, a measurement of the potential for rotating winds, reached over 200m²/s². The upper level jet stream also contributed a large amount of wind shear. These factors were all indicative of a high potential for severe weather.|$|E
5|$|As {{the storm}} system moved eastward toward the Ohio, Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys on April 27, a very {{powerful}} 80–100 knot mid-level jet stream moved into the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, behind the trough, creating strong wind shear, with a low pressure center moving quickly northeastward across those areas on the 27th. On the afternoon of April 27, CAPE values were estimated {{to be in the}} range of 2000–3000 J/kg across Louisiana and southern Mississippi, with the moderate instability moving northeastward across the southern Tennessee Valley; in addition, temperatures across the southeastern United States ranged from the 70s°F (mid-20s°C) to the lower 90s°F (near 35°C). <b>Helicity</b> levels ranged from 450–600 m2/s2, which were supportive for significant tornadic activity and strong to violent long-track tornadoes.|$|E

In the massless limit, it means that only one of two possible chiralities is observed for either particle. These are the only <b>helicities</b> (and chiralities) included in the Standard Model of particle interactions.|$|R
40|$|Partial-wave {{operators}} for lattice QCD {{are developed}} {{in order to}} facilitate the identification of the spins of two-hadron scattering states corresponding to zero total momentum. Taking the periodic boundary conditions for lattice states into account, orthogonal sets of partial-wave operators for orbital angular momentum are identified. When combined with the intrinsic spins of the hadrons, orthogonal sets of parent operators for total angular momentum $J$ and projection $M$ are obtained. The parent operators are subduced to irreducible representations of the octahedral group in order to obtain descendant operators for use in lattice calculations. The descendant operators retain orthogonality with respect to $J$. The spin of a state can be identified by the spin of parent operators that dominate creation of the state. For nonzero total momentum, operators are developed for a range of <b>helicities</b> and they are subduced to irreducible representations corresponding to the different directions of total momentum. Sets of operators that include a sufficient range of <b>helicities</b> allow identification of spin $J$ when a state couples to operators with <b>helicities</b> {{less than or equal to}} $J$, but not to operators with higher <b>helicities.</b> Comment: 11 page...|$|R

Lett. 27, 1141 (2002) ] for wavefront shaping working in the visible spectral domain, based on patterned liquid crystal technology. This device generates helical modes of visible light {{with the possibility of}} electro-optically switching between opposite <b>helicities</b> by controlling the handedness of the input circular polarization. By cascading this approach, fast switching among multiple wavefront <b>helicities</b> can be achieved, with potential applications to multi-state optical information encoding. The approach demonstrated here can be generalized to other polarization-controlled devices for wavefront shaping, such as switchable lenses, beam-splitters, and holographic elements...|$|R
5|$|The {{combination}} of wind shear and low-level <b>helicity</b> produced moderate convection across central Florida {{in association with}} the precursor low pressure system. Late on September20, a supercell developed near Lake Apopka, and tracking quickly northward it spawned an EF1 tornado near Eustis; the tornado tracked for 1.83mi (2.94km) and reached winds of about 100mph (160km/h). The tornado destroyed 20homes, left 30others severely damaged, injured one person, and caused power outages for about 300people. Damage totaled $6.2million (2007USD). Tornadoes were also reported near Marianna and Chipley. The precursor low pressure system also generated lightning that stuck and killed a man in Hendry County, Florida.|$|E
25|$|A {{closely related}} {{property}} is chirality, {{which in turn}} is closely related to a more easily visualized property called <b>helicity.</b> The <b>helicity</b> of a particle is the direction of its spin relative to its momentum; particles with spin {{in the same direction as}} their momentum are called right-handed and otherwise they are called left-handed. When a particle is massless, the direction of its momentum relative to its spin is frame independent, while for massive particles it is possible to 'overtake' the particle by a Lorentz transformation flipping the <b>helicity.</b> Chirality is a technical property (defined through the transformation behaviour under the Poincaré group) that agrees with <b>helicity</b> for (approximately) massless particles and is still well defined for massive particles.|$|E
25|$|In {{the real}} ocean, the {{condition}} of <b>helicity</b> equal to zero is not generally satisfied exactly.

40|$|We analyse the muon {{longitudinal}} polarization asymmetry ∆long in {{the decay}} K + → π + µ + µ −. It is stressed that, since the muon <b>helicities</b> are not Lorentz–invariant quantities, {{the magnitude of}} ∆long depends in general on the reference frame. We consider the muon <b>helicities</b> in the LAB system, and study {{the sensitivity of the}} longitudinal polarization asymmetry to the flavour–mixing parameters in the Standard Model for stopped and in–flight decaying K +. A similar analysis is carried out for the decay KL → µ + µ −. We find that in both cases the asymmetry is diluted when increasing the energy of the decaying kaons. I...|$|R
40|$|An {{action for}} a massless {{graviton}} interacting {{with a massive}} spin- 2 field is proposed. The model is based on coupling the metric tensor to an SP(4) gauge theory spontaneously broken to $SL(2,C) $. The symmetry breaking is achieved by using a Higgs multiplet containing a scalar field and a vector field related by a constraint. We show that in the non-unitary gauge and for the Fierz-Pauli form of the mass term, the five degrees of freedom of the massive spin- 2 are identified with the two tensor <b>helicities,</b> two vector <b>helicities</b> of the Goldstone vector, and a scalar.

40|$|We {{calculate}} analytically the spin-orbital {{decomposition of}} the angular momentum using completely non-paraxial fields that have {{certain degree of}} linkage of electric and magnetic lines. The split of the angular momentum into spin-orbital components is worked out for non-null knotted electromagnetic fields. The relation between magnetic and electric <b>helicities</b> and spin-orbital decomposition of the angular momentum is considered. We demonstrate {{that even if the}} total angular momentum and the values of the spin and orbital momentum are the same, the behaviour of the local angular momentum density is rather different. By taking cases with constant and non-constant electric and magnetic <b>helicities,</b> we show that the total angular momentum density present different characteristics during time evolution...|$|R
25|$|Antineutrinos are {{produced}} in nuclear beta decay {{together with a}} beta particle, in which, e.g., a neutron decays into a proton, electron, and antineutrino. All antineutrinos observed thus far possess right-handed <b>helicity</b> (i.e. {{only one of the}} two possible spin states has ever been seen), while neutrinos are left-handed. Nevertheless, as neutrinos have mass, their <b>helicity</b> is frame-dependent, so it is the related frame-independent property of chirality that is relevant here.|$|E
25|$|Only a few {{mechanisms}} in nature {{are known to}} systematically produce circularly polarized light. In 1911, Albert Abraham Michelson discovered that light reflected from the golden scarab beetle Chrysina resplendens is preferentially left-polarized. Since then, circular polarization has been measured in several other scarab beetles like Chrysina gloriosa, {{as well as some}} crustaceans such as the mantis shrimp. In these cases, the underlying mechanism is the molecular-level <b>helicity</b> of the chitinous cuticle.|$|E
25|$|John Bryan Taylor took up {{the issue}} and began a {{detailed}} theoretical study of the concept, publishing a groundbreaking 1974 article on the topic. He demonstrated that as the magnetic field that generated the pinch was relaxing, it interacted with the pre-existing stabilising fields, creating a self-stable magnetic field. The phenomenon was driven by the system's desire to preserve magnetic <b>helicity,</b> which suggested {{a number of ways}} to improve the confinement time.|$|E

40|$|The {{validity}} of a closure called the minimal tau approximation (MTA), is {{tested in the}} context of dynamo theory, wherein triple correlations are assumed to provide relaxation of the turbulent electromotive force. Under MTA, the alpha effect in mean field dynamo theory becomes proportional to a relaxation time scale multiplied by the difference between kinetic and current <b>helicities.</b> It is shown that the value of the relaxation time is positive and, in units of the turnover time at the forcing wavenumber, it is of the order of unity. It is quenched by the magnetic field – roughly independently of the magnetic Reynolds number. However, this independence becomes uncertain at large magnetic Reynolds number. Kinetic and current <b>helicities</b> are shown to be dominated by large scale properties of the flow...|$|R
25|$|On May 10, a {{new wave}} of tornadoes from a second system {{affected}} portions of the southern Plains and the Lower-Mississippi Valley. Temperatures across the region reached the 80s across portions of the South with mostly upper 70s elsewhere. CAPE values were between 1000 and 2000 j/kg {{near the center of the}} low with reading over 2000 j/kg across Mississippi. <b>Helicity</b> levels were over 250. A moderate risk of severe storms was issued for a large portions of the Mississippi Valley as well as the Eastern Plains. Severe storms began to occur across northwestern Arkansas, southeastern Kansas and eastern Oklahoma during the late afternoon hours.

25|$|A lot {{of effort}} has been put into {{controlling}} cell selectivity. For example, {{attempts have been made}} to modify and optimize the physicochemical parameters of the peptides to control the selectivities, including net charge, <b>helicity,</b> hydrophobicity per residue (H), hydrophobic moment (μ) and the angle subtended by the positively charged polar helix face (Φ). Other mechanisms like the introduction of D-amino acids and fluorinated amino acids in the hydrophobic phase are believed to break the secondary structure and thus reduce hydrophobic interaction with mammalian cells. It has also been found that Pro→Nlys substitution in Pro-containing β-turn antimicrobial peptides was a promising strategy for the design of new small bacterial cell-selective antimicrobial peptides with intracellular mechanisms of action. It has been suggested that direct attachment of magainin to the substrate surface decreased nonspecific cell binding and led to improved detection limit for bacterial cells such as Salmonella and E. coli.|$|E
25|$|By 1630 UTC, {{the large}} MCS began to {{splinter}} into two sections: {{the southern part}} slowed, lagging into southeast Tennessee, while the northern part accelerated, reaching Pennsylvania by 1930 UTC. The split was related to several factors, including a band of subsidence over eastern Kentucky and western West Virginia; local downslope winds over the Appalachians; and an inversion over the same area. These factors allowed {{the northern part of}} the MCS to accelerate due to efficient ducting, while the southern part slowed as the boundary layer warmed and moistened. Numerous surface-based supercells began to develop in the southern area, beginning with one that produced an F3 tornado at about 1630 UTC near Cleveland, Tennessee. Meanwhile, a new band of scattered thunderstorms developed at 1500 UTC over eastern Arkansas and Missouri; over the next four hours, this band became the focus for several intense supercells, starting in eastern Illinois and southern Indiana. In the wake of the MCS, backing low-level winds, rapid diurnal destabilization, and perhaps cool, mid-level advection had occurred over the warm sector, weakening the convective inhibition (CINH) layer, and favorable wind profiles bolstered <b>helicity</b> to over 230 m²/s²—a combination of factors conducive to tornadogenesis. Consequently, the storms increased in intensity and coverage as they moved into Illinois, Indiana, and northern Kentucky, producing several tornadoes, including the first F5 tornado of the day, at 1920 UTC, near Depauw, Indiana. Several of the storms to form between 1920 and 2020 UTC became significant, long-lived supercells, producing many strong or violent tornadoes, including three F5s at Depauw; Xenia, Ohio; and Brandenburg, Kentucky. These storms formed the second of three convective bands to generate tornadoes.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} the unique geometric properties of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), and demonstrates how such features are inherited by extended MHD, viz. models that incorporate two-fluid effects (the Hall term and electron inertia). The generalized <b>helicities,</b> and other geometric expressions for these models {{are presented in}} a topological context, emphasizing their universal facets. Some of the results presented include: the generalized Kelvin circulation theorems; the existence of two Lie-dragged 2 -forms; and two concomitant <b>helicities</b> that can be studied via the Jones polynomial, which is widely utilized in Chern-Simons theory. The ensuing commonality is traced {{to the existence of}} an underlying Hamiltonian structure for all the extended MHD models, exemplified by the presence of a unique noncanonical Poisson bracket, and its associated energy.

40|$|The {{ground state}} of twist-bend nematic liquid {{crystals}} is a heliconical molecular arrangement {{in which the}} nematic director precesses uniformly about an axis, making a fixed angle with it. Both precession senses are allowed in the ground state of these phases. When {{one of the two}} <b>helicities</b> is prescribed, a single helical nematic phase emerges. A quadratic elastic theory is proposed here for each of these phases which features the same elastic constants as the classical theory of the nematic phase, requiring all of them to be positive. To describe the helix axis, it introduces an extra director field which becomes redundant for ordinary nematics. Putting together helical nematics with opposite <b>helicities,</b> we reconstruct a twist-bend nematic, for which the quadratic elastic energies of the two helical variants are combined in a non-convex energy...|$|R
40|$|While the particle-number-conserving {{convolution}} formalism {{established in}} the Drell-Yan-West reference frame is frequently used to compute exclusive amplitudes in the light-front quantization, this formalism is limited to only those frames where the light-front <b>helicities</b> are not changed and the good (plus) component of the current remains unmixed. For an explicit demonstration of such criteria, we present {{the relations between the}} current matrix elements in the two typical reference frames used for calculations of the exclusive amplitudes, i. e. the Drell-Yan-West and Breit frames and investigate both pseudoscalar and vector electromagnetic currents in detail. We find that the light-front <b>helicities</b> are unchanged and the good component of the current does not mix with the other components of the current under the transformation between these two frames. Thus, the pseudoscalar and vector form factors obtained by the diagonal convolution formalism in both frames must indeed be identical. However, such coincidence between the Drell-Yan-West and Breit frames does not hold in general. We give an explicit example in which the light-front <b>helicities</b> are changed and the plus component of the current is mixed with other components under the change of reference frame. In such a case, the relationship between the frames should be carefully analyzed before the established convolution formalism in the Drell-Yan-West frame is used. Comment: 14 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
