5|$|The duo {{tries to}} make it to the moving truck, but Sid's dog, Scud, sees them, and gives chase. Buzz gets left behind while saving Woody from Scud, and Woody tries rescuing him with Andy's RC car, but the other toys, {{thinking}} Woody eliminated RC as well, attack and toss him off the truck. Having evaded Scud, Buzz and RC retrieve Woody, and continue after the truck. Upon seeing Woody and Buzz together on RC, the other toys realize their mistake, and try to help them get back aboard, but RC's batteries become depleted, stranding them. Woody ignites the rocket on Buzz's back and manages to throw RC into the truck before they soar into the air. Buzz opens his wings to free himself from the rocket before it explodes, gliding with Woody to land safely <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> in the car, right next to Andy.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} {{embalming}} used by White is unrecorded, but in 1748 {{he had studied}} under the anatomist William Hunter, who had developed an early system of arterial embalming, therefore {{it is likely that}} White used the same method. The veins and arteries would have been injected with a mixture of turpentine and vermilion, after which the organs would have been removed from the chest and abdomen and placed in water, to clean them and to reduce their bulk. As much blood as possible would then have been squeezed out of the corpse, and the whole body washed with alcohol. The next stage would have been to replace the organs and to repeat the injection of turpentine and vermilion. The body cavities would then have been filled with a mixture of camphor, nitre and resin, before the body was sewn up and all openings filled with camphor. After a final washing, the body would have been packed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> containing plaster of Paris, to absorb any moisture, and then probably coated with tar, to preserve it.|$|E

25|$|After {{the launch}} on July 28, 1973, and {{entering}} Skylab, the spiders were released by astronaut Owen Garriott <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> that resembled a window frame.

25|$|Its wings were {{trapezoidal}} in plan, {{though with}} long, rounded tips. Their thickness reduced outwards, largely from below, {{contributing to the}} significant dihedral. Structurally, the wings were wooden, each with two longerons which were joined <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> spar by plywood skin out to three-quarter span; this appears dark in the photograph above. The rest of the surfaces, including the unbalanced ailerons which occupied about half the span, were silk covered. The ailerons had frames of elektron, a recently developed magnesium alloy.|$|E

25|$|The {{results of}} the 1955 {{election}} {{have been attributed to}} fraud and intimidation. Voters were intimidated by a voting system involving colored pieces of paper that had to be put <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> in full view of Sihanouk's political figures, soldiers and local police. In many cases, voting results were simply falsified as in the case where a district that had been a Viet Minh stronghold for years did not return a single vote for the far left. Writer Philip Short points to a 1957 statement by Sihanouk admitting that thirty six electoral districts had voted Pracheachon or Democrat majority whereas the official results said that they had won none.|$|E
25|$|In Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, busses on most city routes have {{externally}} mounted carriers for bicycles, and {{bikes are}} {{allowed on the}} light rail trains {{at no extra cost}} outside of rush hour. All public transit buses in Chicago and suburbs allow up to two bikes at all times. The same is true of Grand River Transit buses in the Region of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Trains allow bikes with some restrictions. Where such services are not available, some cyclists get around this restriction by removing their pedals and loosening their handlebars as to fit <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> or by using folding bikes that can be brought onto the train or bus like a piece of luggage. The article on buses in Christchurch, New Zealand lists 27 routes with bike racks.|$|E
25|$|The Holden comb was {{suited for}} the combing of short staple wools. The slivers of wool are fed into the machine through the feed guides to the filing head rollers and {{transferred}} to the pins of the comb circle by the lashing action of the filling heads. As the comb circle rotates, the fallers of the square motion rise, their pins piercing the fringe of fibres held in the comb circle by the keeper plate, and by drawing away give the fibres their initial combing. This removes any short fibres or noil and some long fibres termed robbings which are deposited in a box {{at the back of}} the square motion. As the comb circle carries the remaining fibres to the drawing-off head the fringe is penetrated by the pins of the intersecting or nacteur combs, the drawing-off rollers giving the fibres their final combing by removing the long fibres from the pins of the nacteur comb and the comb circle; the short ones being left behind. The long fibres or top pass through a revolving funnel to the coiler mechanism and into a can directly underneath. The short fibres or noils remaining in the nacteur combs are transferred to the comb circle by a small comb and removed with the noil in the comb circle pins by brushes and lifting knives and deposited <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> ready for removal.|$|E

500|$|The scenes where Dwight climbs <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> {{almost did}} not make the episode. Mike Schur, who wrote the episode, feared that Dwight {{climbing}} into the box would not only make the episode [...] "crazy broad," [...] but also make the rest of the episode look boring by comparison. After shooting the scene, however, he described it as [...] "the most natural thing in the world." [...] Phil Shaw, the stunt man for The Office, did most of the work in the box. Schur described Dwight's emergence from the box as his [...] "action hero" [...] moment. Daniels likened the scene to the movie Alien.|$|E
500|$|Instruments in Madagascar {{were brought}} to the island by {{successive}} waves of settlers from across the Old World. Over 1500 years ago, the earliest settlers from Indonesia brought the oldest and most emblematic instruments, including the tube zither (valiha) which evolved <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> form (marovany) distinct to the island. [...] Later settlers from the Arabian peninsula and the eastern coast of Africa contributed early lutes, whistles and other instruments that were incorporated into local musical traditions by the mid-16th century. The influence of instruments and musical styles from France and Great Britain began to {{have a significant impact on}} music in Madagascar by the 19th century.|$|E
500|$|In {{the season}} 10 episode [...] "Thirty Minutes over Tokyo", the family travels to Japan. The episode {{references}} and mocks {{several aspects of}} Japanese and American culture, as well as differences between the two. At a sumo wrestling match, Bart and Homer encounter the Japanese emperor, Akihito. After Homer throws him into a trunk of sumo thongs, Bart and Homer are put in jail, {{where they have to}} re-enact a kabuki play about the forty-seven Ronin, do origami, flower arranging and meditation. The episode also references the Japanese's adaption to American culture. Although all other episodes of The Simpsons have been dubbed and broadcast on Japanese television, [...] "Thirty Minutes Over Tokyo" [...] has never aired in Japan. The episode, which contains a scene showing Homer throwing the Emperor of Japan <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> filled with sumo thongs, was considered disrespectful.|$|E

500|$|... "Thirty Minutes Over Tokyo" [...] {{is one of}} two episodes {{that never}} aired in Japan (the other being season 11 episode [...] "Little Big Mom"). [...] The {{reasoning}} behind this was that a scene in the episode, which shows Homer throwing Akihito, the current emperor of Japan, <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> filled with sumo thongs, was considered disrespectful. There was also a rumor that Sanrio objected to the portrayal of the Hello Kitty factory featured briefly in the episode. The episode has become study material for sociology courses at University of California Berkeley, where it is used to [...] "examine issues of the production and reception of cultural objects, in this case, a satirical cartoon show", and {{to figure out what it}} is [...] "trying to tell audiences about aspects primarily of American society, and, to a lesser extent, about other societies".|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote, [...] "even without that final sequence, this would still {{be one of the}} best episodes, with Bart at his very best. The scenes in the box factory are superb, as is Martin and Skinner's joyful singing and, once again, Edna and Bart's {{enforced}} team-up." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote [...] "lots of great moments pop up in this excellent program. Bart’s rise to fame sparkles via its deft parody of instant— and fleeting— fame, and many wacky bits show up along the way such as Homer’s fear that Bart got turned <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>box.</b> [...] This might be Season Five’s best show." [...] Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of A- and Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a score of 4 out of 5.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the lower}} price console's {{positioning}} as an inexpensive entry into 32-bit gaming, Sega {{had a difficult}} time convincing third-party developers to create games for the new system. [...] Top developers were already aware of the coming arrival of the Sega Saturn, Nintendo 64, and PlayStation, and did not believe the 32X would be capable of competing with any of those systems. The quick development time of the 32X also made game development difficult, according to Franz. [...] Not wanting to create games for an add-on that was [...] "a technological dead-end", many developers decided not to make games for the system. [...] Issues also plagued titles developed in-house due to the time crunch to release the 32X. [...] According to Bayless, [...] "games in the queue were effectively jammed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>box</b> as fast as possible, which meant massive cutting of corners in every conceivable way. [...] Even from the outset, designs of those games were deliberately conservative because of the time crunch. [...] By the time they shipped they were even more conservative; they did nothing to show off what the hardware was capable of." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{oral history}} interview, Singh {{said that one}} of the murder trials that he had presided over, the [...] "Body in the Box" [...] case, led to the {{abolition}} of jury trials in Singapore criminal cases. Following the trial of a young man, Freddy Tan, for the murder of his friend whose decomposed body was found stuffed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>box,</b> Singh agreed with the jury to convict Tan of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and sentence him to life imprisonment. However, he later learnt that in the jury room a bullying Dutch juror had wanted to impose the death penalty, but because the other jurors disliked his attitude they voted to impose a lower verdict on Tan. The father of the deceased felt an injustice had been done and went to see the Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew. Lee then sent for Singh, and Singh informed him of what had happened with the jurors. Lee asked Singh, [...] "Well what do you think. Shall I abolish the jury?" [...] Singh replied that if he had tried Tan without a jury, he would have convicted him of murder without hesitation. Following a public inquiry, jury trials were abolished for all criminal cases in 1969.|$|E
