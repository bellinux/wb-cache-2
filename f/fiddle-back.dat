"Reduced, however, to my {{last two}} guineas, I {{began to think}} of my dear mother and friends whom I had left behind me, and so bought that generous beast <b>Fiddle-back,</b> and bade adieu to Cork with only five shillings in my pocket. This, to be sure, was but a scanty {{allowance}} for man and horse toward a journey of above a hundred miles; but I did not despair, for I knew I must find friends on the road.|$|E
60|$|A new {{consultation}} {{was held}} among Goldsmith's friends {{as to his}} future course, and it was determined he should try the law. His uncle Contarine agreed to advance the necessary funds, and actually furnished him with fifty pounds, with which he set off for London, to enter on his studies at the Temple. Unfortunately, he fell in company at Dublin with a Roscommon acquaintance, one whose wits had been sharpened about town, who beguiled him into a gambling-house, and soon left him as penniless as when he bestrode the redoubtable <b>Fiddle-back.</b>|$|E

I went to Cork and converted my horse, which you prize so much higher than <b>Fiddle-back,</b> into cash, took my passage in a ship bound for America, and, at the same time, paid the captain for my freight and all the other expenses of my voyage. But it so happened that the wind did not answer for three weeks; and you know, mother, that I could not command the elements. My misfortune was that, when the wind served, I happened to be with a party in the country, and my friend the captain never inquired after me, but set sail with as much indifference as if I had been on board. The remainder of my time I employed in the city and its environs, viewing everything curious, and you know no one can starve while he has money in his pocket.|$|E
5000|$|The recluse spiders {{or brown}} spiders, genus Loxosceles (...) , {{also known as}} <b>fiddle-backs,</b> violin spiders, or reapers, are a genus of venomous spiders known for their bite, which {{sometimes}} produces a characteristic set of symptoms known as loxoscelism. Recluse spiders are now identified {{as members of the}} family Sicariidae, having formerly been placed in their own family, the Loxoscelidae. Although recluse spiders have a bad reputation, they are usually not aggressive.|$|R
6000|$|The worthy {{niece and}} {{housekeeper}} {{of the hero}} of La Mancha {{could not have been}} more surprised and dismayed at one of the Don's clandestine expeditions than were the mother and friends of Goldsmith when they heard of his mysterious departure. Weeks elapsed, and nothing was seen or heard of him. It was feared that he had left the country on one of his wandering freaks, and his poor mother was reduced almost to despair, when one day he arrived at her door almost as forlorn in plight as the prodigal son. Of his thirty pounds not a shilling was left; and instead of the goodly steed on which he had issued forth on his errantry, he was mounted on a sorry little pony, which he had nicknamed <b>Fiddle-back.</b> As soon as his mother was well assured of his safety, she rated him soundly for his inconsiderate conduct. His brothers and sisters, who were tenderly attached to him, interfered, and succeeded in mollifying her ire; and whatever lurking anger the good dame might have, was no doubt effectually vanquished by the following whimsical narrative which he drew up at his brother's house and dispatched to her: ...|$|E

40|$|Loxosceles rufescens, {{commonly}} known as the Mediterranean Recluse or Mediterranean <b>Fiddle-Back</b> Spider is recorded from Iran for the first time. The genus Loxosceles contains 103 accepted species, two of them (including L. rufescens) are cosmopolitan. All Loxosceles species tested so far possess necrotic venoms, which is a unique characteristic among the Order Araneae. Considering this characteristic, it is of medical importance to determine a specific geographical distribution of these spiders. Collecting methods include visual inspection and direct hand collecting. All of the specimens were collected in Tehran. Six specimens of both sexes were collected from parks, houses and apartments. The characteristics of the genus, which are the unique arrangement of six eyes in three diads, the violin shaped mark on the cephalothorax, and the short tibia of adult male palpi with narrow base and itâ€™s embolus which is about as long as the width of the globular bulb were observed and recorded. Having the cytotoxicity of the venom and its urban distribution in mind, L. rufescens is probably among the more important spider species of Iran. Since there are no reports of loxoscelism from Iran, we assume that the bites are either infrequent or misdiagnosed. Therefore further studies are needed to clarify the medical importance degree of this species...|$|E
