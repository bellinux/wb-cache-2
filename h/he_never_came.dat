5|$|In mid-1806, Cabell {{learned that}} his father was sick. Not long after, however, he {{received}} word {{that his father was}} improving and expected to meet him in Virginia en route to the capital. Although a rendezvous location had not been set, he assumed it would be in Lynchburg, where the Breckinridges had relatives. In October, he traveled to his uncle Lewis Breckinridge's home to wait for his father, but <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>came.</b> Disappointed, he returned to Princeton for the beginning of the new term, unaware that his father's recovery had been short-lived. Later he {{learned that his}} father had attempted to leave Cabell's Dale on October 22 but collapsed off his horse and returned to his sick bed; he died December 14, 1806.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>came</b> {{so close}} to one again. Hick's injury and the {{declaration}} affair overshadowed what {{up to that point}} had been a somewhat mixed series as far as the Tests had been concerned: in his other five innings he had been dismissed cheaply three times, but he had also made 80 at Brisbane.|$|E
25|$|Also {{on display}} {{was a letter}} written by Arthur O'Connor. He had been {{committed}} to Hanwell on 6 May 1875 for firing an unloaded pistol at Queen Victoria earlier on 29 February. The purpose of writing was to petition for his release; which was granted on 16 November 1876. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>came</b> {{to the attention of}} the authorities again.|$|E

25|$|Perks was 34 when cricket resumed in 1946 {{and though}} <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>came</b> back into {{representative}} calculations, he maintained a surprising consistency {{for the rest}} of his career: his first-class averages between 1946 and 1955 were all within the very narrow range from 23.28 in 1946 to 26.16 in 1951. Perks' tireless fast-medium bowling was considered an important part of Worcestershire's rise to third in the County Championship in 1949 and fourth in 1951.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to improve a bullpen that often {{struggled}} in 2013 the Tigers signed veteran closer Joe Nathan to a two-year, $20 million contract, with a club option for 2016, and later signed Joba Chamberlain to a one-year, $2.5 million deal. On May 2, 2014, a month into the season, with the bullpen having a combined 5.37 ERA (29th out of 30 in the MLB) the Tigers signed free agent reliever Joel Hanrahan to a one-year contract, but <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>came</b> off the disabled list to pitch for the team in 2014. The team further bolstered the bullpen near the MLB trading deadline, dealing pitchers Corey Knebel and Jake Thompson to the Texas Rangers in exchange for former All-Star closer Joakim Soria on July 23.|$|E
25|$|Although Terao fought several tournaments at sekiwake <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>came</b> {{close to}} ōzeki, his best {{performance}} as sekiwake being 9–6. His last appearance in san'yaku was at komusubi rank in July 1994. In March 1995 he upset Takanohana {{for the only}} time as a yokozuna, earning his last special prize. In November 1999, {{at the age of}} 35, he defeated Musashimaru for his final kinboshi. He remained in makuuchi until May 2000 when he was finally demoted at age 37 after 90 consecutive top division tournaments. However, he managed to return to makuuchi for two tournaments in March and May 2001, becoming at 38 years and 24 days the oldest man post World War II to earn promotion to the top division. His last tournament was in September 2002, where he scored only five wins at the rank of jūryō 11 and faced certain demotion to the makushita division.|$|E

25|$|After scoring 100 not out for Gloucestershire's Second XI in 1964, Shepherd had a {{reasonably}} successful, though late-starting, first class playing career for Gloucestershire, stretching from 1965 to 1979, and though <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>came</b> close to international selection he was popular both with his team-mates and the Gloucestershire supporters. He {{started with a}} bang, scoring 108 on debut against Oxford University in April 1965, and made eleven more hundreds over the years, though only twice (in 1969 and 1975) did he average over 30. Mainly a middle-order batsman, and never the slimmest of men even in his younger days, he relied more on his fine shot placement than speed across the ground, and his bowling was almost non-existent: he took only two wickets in his entire first-class career. One famous incident at the Gloucestershire Cricket Club saw Shepherd hitting the ball so hard into the crowd that it knocked out a spectator reading a newspaper. The spectator was taken to hospital and recovered with only minor injuries.|$|E
25|$|Though outnumbered, Geronimo {{fought against}} both Mexican and United States troops and became {{famous for his}} daring {{exploits}} and numerous escapes from capture from 1858 to 1886. One such escape, as legend has it, {{took place in the}} Robledo Mountains of southwest New Mexico. The legend states that Geronimo and his followers entered a cave, and the U.S. soldiers waited outside the entrance for him, but <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>came</b> out. Later, it was heard that Geronimo was spotted outside, nearby. The second entrance through which he escaped has yet to be found and the cave is still called Geronimo's Cave, even though no reference to this event or this cave has been found in the historic or oral record. Moreover, there are many stories of this type with other caves referenced that state that Geronimo or other Apaches entered to escape troops, but were not seen exiting. These stories are in all likelihood apocryphal.|$|E
500|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{begins to}} {{read one of}} his {{childhood}} horror stories to the children, but Michael enters and insists that he stop upsetting the kids. Michael decides to show {{the children and the}} office a video of him as a child (Jake Kalender) during an appearance on a kid's show, where he revealed his dream was to [...] "get married and have 100 kids, so I can have 100 friends, and no one can say 'no' to being my friend." [...] He retreats into his office when he realizes that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>came</b> close to that dream. Toby talks to Michael, who decides to start online dating (with the user name [...] "Little Kid Lover"). After being tormented by Jake all day, Dwight is finally stern with him, which quietly pleases Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey). Pam wins over Jake with the paper shredder. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) leaves the office early to go on a date, to Pam's chagrin. Michael and Dwight end the party by singing to the children.|$|E

500|$|The {{conductor}} Pierre Monteux {{had worked}} with Diaghilev since 1911 and had {{been in charge of}} the orchestra at the premiere of Petrushka. Monteux's first reaction to The Rite, after hearing Stravinsky play a piano version, was to leave the room and find a quiet corner. He drew Diaghilev aside and said he would never conduct music like that; Diaghilev managed to change his mind. Although he would perform his duties with conscientious professionalism, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>came</b> to enjoy the work; nearly fifty years after the premiere he told enquirers that he detested it. In old age he said to Sir Thomas Beecham's biographer Charles Reid: [...] "I did not like Le Sacre then. [...] I have conducted it fifty times since. [...] I do not like it now". On 30 March Monteux informed Stravinsky of modifications he thought were necessary to the score, all of which the composer implemented. The orchestra, drawn mainly from the Concerts Colonne in Paris, comprised 99 players, much larger than normally employed at the theatre, and had difficulty fitting into the orchestra pit.|$|E
500|$|Ganteaume was {{selected}} to tour England with the West Indies team in 1957 {{at the age of}} 36. He played 19 first-class matches on the tour and scored 800 runs at an average of 27.58. He passed fifty in seven innings, with a top-score of 92 against Glamorgan. Norman Preston, the editor of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, suggested neither Ganteaume nor any of the other three specialist opening batsmen in the team [...] "came up to expectations", forcing Frank Worrell to open the batting. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>came</b> close to selection for a Test match. After the tour, Ganteaume played just twice more for Trinidad in first-class cricket, and ended his career with 2,785 first-class runs at an average of 34.81 and five centuries. Having played just one Test innings, Ganteaume was left with a Test batting average of 112. This is higher than that of Donald Bradman, who has the highest average of those to play more than 20 innings in a Test career. As of 2013, his average is the highest by a former player to have appeared in a solitary Test in their career.|$|E
500|$|Anne {{was unable}} to walk between January and July 1713. At Christmas, she was feverish, and lay {{unconscious}} for hours, which led to rumours of her impending death. She recovered, but was seriously ill again in March. By July, Anne had lost confidence in Harley; his secretary recorded that Anne told the cabinet [...] "that he neglected all business; that he was seldom to be understood; that when he did explain himself, she could not depend upon {{the truth of what}} he said; that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>came</b> to her at the time she appointed; that he often came drunk; [...] last, to crown all, he behaved himself towards her with ill manner, indecency and disrespect." [...] On 27 July 1714, during Parliament's summer recess, she dismissed Harley as Lord Treasurer. Despite failing health, which her doctors blamed on the emotional strain of matters of state, she attended two late-night cabinet meetings that failed to determine Harley's successor. A third meeting was cancelled when she became too ill to attend. She was rendered unable to speak by a stroke on 30 July 1714, the anniversary of Gloucester's death, and on the advice of the Privy Council handed the treasurer's staff of office to Whig grandee Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury. She died around 7:30a.m. on 1 August 1714. John Arbuthnot, one of her doctors, thought her death was a release from a life of ill-health and tragedy; he wrote to Jonathan Swift, [...] "I believe sleep was never more welcome to a weary traveller than death was to her." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Rod Roddewig, a {{contemporary}} of Wilt's, Chamberlain documented his love life using a Day-Timer. Every time Chamberlain {{went to bed}} with a different woman, he put a check in his Day-Timer. Over a 10-day period, there were 23 checks in the book, {{which would be a}} rate of 2.3 women per day. Chamberlain divided that number in half, to be conservative and to correct for degrees of variation. He then multiplied that number by the number of days he had been alive at the time minus 15 years. That was how the 20,000 number came into existence. In response to public backlash regarding his promiscuity, Chamberlain later emphasized that [...] "the point of using the number was to show that sex was a great part of my life as basketball was a great part of my life. That's the reason why I was single." [...] In a 1999 interview shortly before his death, Chamberlain regretted not having explained the sexual climate {{at the time of his}} escapades, and warned other men who admired him for it, closing with the words: [...] "With all of you men out there who think that having a thousand different ladies is pretty cool, I have learned in my life I've found out that having one woman a thousand different times is much more satisfying." [...] Chamberlain also acknowledged that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>came</b> close to marrying and had no intention of raising any children. However, in 2015 a man named Aaron Levi came forward claiming to be Chamberlain's son based on non-identifying papers from his adoption and information from his biological mother. Chamberlain's sister refused to provide DNA evidence for testing, so Levi's claim is not conclusive.|$|E
2500|$|This {{combination}} {{meant that}} when wickets were treacherous Smith generally proved deadly, but in less favourable conditions he was rarely effective and his slight build {{meant he was}} unsuited to large amounts of work as a [...] "stock" [...] bowler {{even though he had}} the extreme accuracy required. Consequently, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>came</b> into consideration for Test selection, though he showed great ability on many occasions against the very best batting sides.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the murder}} of Dennis Kerr, Krueger was {{transferred}} back to the Oak Ridge division of the Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre, where {{he had spent the}} majority of his 34 preceding years in custody. In the years after Kerr's murder, he was the focus of a biography and several documentary films and sometimes tried to explain why he killed, but <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>came</b> up with rational reasons. [...] He said in a 1993 interview: [...] "I'm accused of having no morality, which is a fair assessment, because my morality is whatever the system allows." [...] On March 5, 2010, his 71st birthday, Krueger died of natural causes.|$|E

2500|$|On October 23, 1682, Francis Collins, an English Quaker and a {{bricklayer}} by trade, {{became the}} first settler {{within the boundaries of}} what today is Haddonfield. Collins soon built a house, [...] "Mountwell," [...] on a tract of 400 acres. [...] Haddonfield was further developed by Elizabeth Haddon (1680–1762), whose Quaker father, John Haddon, bought a [...] tract of land in the English colony of West Jersey to escape religious persecution. Elizabeth set sail alone from Southwark, England to the New World in 1701. Shortly after her arrival, she made a marriage proposal to John Estaugh, a Quaker minister, and they were married in 1702.

2500|$|On the April 14 {{episode of}} Raw, Triple H, Randy Orton and Batista {{came down to}} the ring to attack The Shield after their 11-on-3 {{handicap}} match, using the name and the theme of Evolution. The Shield defeated Evolution in a six-man tag team match at Extreme Rules. and then The Shield defeated Evolution yet again in a six-man No Holds Barred elimination tag match at Payback with a victory in which none of The Shield were eliminated. On the June 2 Raw, Batista quit the WWE (kayfabe) after his title match request for the night was denied by Triple H due to Daniel Bryan's neck injury at the time and unable to complete. This was done to write Batista off WWE television so he could promote Guardians of the Galaxy, however <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>came</b> back to WWE since. Later that night, Triple H declared that he had resorted to [...] "Plan B" [...] in his quest to destroy The Shield, prompting Seth Rollins to attack Dean Ambrose and Roman Reigns. Although Triple H and Randy Orton were still together as part of The Authority, all references to Evolution were quietly dropped afterwards, effectively ending Evolution again.|$|E
