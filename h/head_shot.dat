5|$|The {{case went}} to trial in British Columbia, where Brashear testified {{that he had no}} memory of the incident. McSorley testified that he tried to hit Brashear in the {{shoulder}} to start a fight with him, but missed, resulting in the <b>head</b> <b>shot.</b> McSorley was found guilty but avoided a jail sentence. He was required to complete 18 months of probation, in which he was not allowed to play in a game against Brashear. Brashear returned to play prior {{to the end of the}} season. McSorley, who missed the remaining 23 games of the regular season, had his suspension officially set at one year following the conviction. However, he ultimately never played in another NHL game during his career.|$|E

In 2001, he won Best Actor at the International Teen Movie Festival (ITMF) in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada for his role in his short film <b>Head</b> <b>Shot.</b> He also received praise in 2001 in an article in Newsday, and this helped further his career. He appeared {{as a member of the}} First Regiment of Virginia Volunteers in the 2003 Civil War film Gods and Generals, which starred Robert Duvall. Fisher parodied actor Tom Cruise in the 2008 film Superhero Movie; a clip of Fisher from the film became popular on the Internet. He had a recurring role as a rookie police officer in 2008 on the television series The Cleaner on A Network. Fisher appeared in 2009 on Gossip Girl. On the third season of the television series Mad Men, Fisher portrayed a friend of character Paul Kinsey.|$|E
25|$|A {{minority}} of the witnesses recognized the first gunshot they heard as weapon fire, but there was hardly any reaction to the first shot from {{a majority of the}} people in the crowd or those riding in the motorcade. Many bystanders later said that they heard what they first thought to be a firecracker or the backfire of one of the vehicles shortly after the President began waving. Although some close witnesses recalled seeing the limousine slow down, nearly stop, or completely stop, the Warren Commission, based on the Zapruder film, found that the limousine had an average speed of 11.2miles per hour over the 186ft of Elm Street immediately preceding the fatal <b>head</b> <b>shot.</b>|$|E

500|$|When CBS {{television}} {{interviewed him}} in 1967, Altgens {{said it was}} obvious to him that the <b>head</b> <b>shot</b> came from behind Kennedy's limousine [...] "because it caused him to bolt forward, dislodging him from this depression in the seat cushion". He added that the commotion across the street after the shooting struck him as odd, since he believed the assassin would have needed to move very quickly to get there.|$|E

[...] "If it were [...] a suicide, why did he do a <b>head</b> <b>shot</b> instead of a chest shot?" [...] asked Bessie DuBois. The theory was that he stuck the shotgun in the ground, leaned over and pulled the trigger, even though it would have taken considerable effort and flexibility on Nelson's part.|$|E

500|$|Mainstream {{periodicals}} {{tended to}} be less than sympathetic; sociologist Paul Ray and psychologist Sherry Anderson discussed in their 2000 book The Cultural Creatives, what they called the media's [...] "zest for attacking" [...] New Age ideas, and offered the example of a 1996 Lance Morrow essay in Time magazine. Nearly a decade earlier, Time had run a long cover story critical of New Age culture; the cover featured a <b>head</b> <b>shot</b> of a famous actress beside the headline, [...] "Om.... THE NEW AGE starring Shirley MacLaine, faith healers, channelers, space travelers, and crystals galore". [...] The story itself, by former Saturday Evening Post editor Otto Friedrich, was sub-titled, [...] "A Strange Mix of Spirituality and Superstition Is Sweeping Across the Country".

500|$|... "Disposable Teens" [...] is a [...] "signature Marilyn Manson song" [...] with a {{bouncing}} guitar riff {{composed of}} staccato articulation. Its lyrics juxtapose the disenfranchisement of contemporary youth with the revolutionary idealism of their parents' generation. The Beatles' influence {{is evident in}} this song; the chorus echoes the disillusionment of the White Albums [...] "Revolution 1". Manson singled out [...] "Target Audience (Narcissus Narcosis)" [...] as his favorite song on the album, and said that it describes every person's desire for self-actualization. Borrowing a riff from English alternative rock band Radiohead, [...] "President Dead" [...] is a guitar-driven song showcasing John 5's technical skills. It opens {{with a sample of}} Don Gardiner's ABC News Radio broadcast announcing the death of John F. Kennedy. The song is 3:13 long, which is a deliberate numerological reference to frame 313 of the Zapruder film—the frame displaying the impact of the fatal <b>head</b> <b>shot</b> which killed Kennedy. [...] "In the Shadow of the Valley of Death" [...] is an introspective song with Adam at his most emotionally vulnerable.|$|E
500|$|The video premiered on October 22, 2008. It is set by a pool, {{as well as}} in a mansion. It {{begins with}} Gaga {{emerging}} from the pool wearing a mirror masquerade mask and a black sleeveless latex bodysuit with a jagged shoulder pad, with two Great Danes beside her. She throws the mask aside and the song begins with a facial shot of Gaga singing it. Gaga wears a metallic sticker on her left cheek in this shot. Featured in the video are scenes of Gaga in a mansion and dancing poolside with her dancers in a turquoise leotard. Gaga attends a wild party where every man and woman tries their luck on a strip poker game. The party gets wilder when all the party's guests strip down to their underwear, dance around, and share kisses with each other. The video also features several white mannequins on her swimming pool deck. During the musical interlude before the [...] "I won't tell you that I love you" [...] hook, Gaga is shown in her trademark [...] "Pop Music Will Never Be Low Brow" [...] sunglasses while sitting beside the pool.

500|$|Shepard was {{designated}} Chief of the Astronaut Office in November 1963. He thereby became responsible for NASA [...] astronaut training. This involved {{the development of}} appropriate training programs for all astronauts and the scheduling of training of individual astronauts for specific missions and roles. He provided and coordinated astronaut input into mission planning and the design of spacecraft and other equipment {{to be used by}} astronauts on space missions. He also was on the selection panel for the NASA Astronaut Group 5 in 1966. He spent much of his time investing in banks, wildcatting, and real estate. He became part owner and vice president of Baytown National Bank and would spend hours on the phone in his NASA office overseeing it. He also bought a partnership in a ranch in Weatherford, Texas, that raised horses and cattle. During this period, his secretary had several <b>head</b> <b>shot</b> photographs taken of Shepard, posed with various expressions on his face. She would post these on the door to his private office, with a sign which said [...] "Mood of the Day". Visitors could then look at the photo to decide whether it was a good time to talk to him.

It was Gosselaar himself who insisted that Dustin Diamond was right for the part as he believed Diamond was Screech in real life. After reading through the script, Diamond was given the part, although Engel later found out that he had misread his <b>head</b> <b>shot</b> and Diamond was considerably younger {{than the rest of the}} cast—a fact that, had he been aware, might have prevented Engel from casting him.|$|E

2500|$|The presidential {{limousine}} {{was passing}} a grassy knoll {{on the north}} side of Elm Street at the moment of the fatal <b>head</b> <b>shot.</b> As the motorcade left the plaza, police officers and spectators ran up the knoll and from a railroad bridge over Elm Street (the triple underpass), to the area behind a five-foot (1.5m) high stockade fence atop the knoll, separating it from a parking lot. No sniper was found. S. M. Holland, who had been watching the motorcade on the triple underpass, testified that [...] "immediately" [...] after the shots were fired, he spotted a plume of smoke arising from the trees by the fence and then ran around the corner where the overpass joined the fence, but did not see anyone running from the area.|$|E
2500|$|Entering {{into the}} fifth season, the {{production}} team knew {{the series was}} not being renewed and had saved money from the budget of each season five episode {{for use in a}} climactic battle for the season finale. The money was instead used for the penultimate episode, [...] "Eye of the Storm", while the last episode ended with an unresolved cliffhanger. Insiders have various theories as to why this happened. The producers were concerned the Sci Fi Channel had lost interest in the show (even though it was their highest-rated program at the time) after they ceased supplying corrective notes for the episodes, and it was believed they did not even bother reading the scripts. One strict rule the Sci Fi Channel had was that a gun couldn't be pointed at a person's head. To test this rule, executive producer Bill Dial presented a script featuring a character getting his <b>head</b> <b>shot</b> completely off—which was ignored. Dial then presented the script for the final episode cliffhanger, which was also ignored. Some claim this was done to encourage fans to push for a sixth season, but members of the production team claim that the decision was personal.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album cover}} for Relapse was first {{published}} through Eminem's Twitter account on April 21, 2009. It illustrates a <b>head</b> <b>shot</b> of the rapper composed by a mosaic of thousands of pills. A sticker on the cover resembles a prescription drug label, on which the patient is Eminem and the prescribing doctor is Dr. Dre. Gil Kaufman of MTV News described the cover as {{a reference to the}} rapper's struggle and addiction to prescription drugs, adding that it follows Eminem's habit of displaying personal issues in his art. The album booklet and back cover follow a pill prescription design. On the backside of the booklet is a dedication to Proof, where Eminem explains that he's sober and that he tried to write a song for him, but that he didn't find one of them good enough therefore he dedicates the whole album to him. The CD itself is meant to represent the lid on a bottle of prescription pills, grey with the big red inscription [...] "Push Down & Turn". The cover for Relapse: Refill is the same, with the background color changed from black to white. The prescription drug label is scratched out and the writing [...] "Refill" [...] is posed next to it.|$|E

2500|$|Butler and {{his musical}} partner David McAlmont, {{and a number}} of other musicians formed the {{backbone}} of Duffy's band for her debut album, Rockferry, which was released on A Records on 3 March 2008. The black and white album art and video for the title track were shot by directors Luke Seomore and Joseph Bull, on and around the Ffestiniog Railway in Porthmadog, which was renamed 'Rockferry' for the occasion. According to Duffy, [...] "The album took nearly four years to make. We had to hire cheap, tiny studios and sometimes there would be three-week periods between writing and recording." [...] Bernard Butler, who was not initially paid, produced four songs for the album, including the single, [...] "Rockferry". The singles [...] "Mercy" [...] and [...] "Stepping Stone", were co-written and produced by Steve Booker, and the second single [...] "Warwick Avenue", by Jimmy Hogarth and Eg White. Duffy released the debut limited edition single [...] "Rockferry" [...] in November 2007 followed by the Steve Booker co-written and produced single, [...] "Mercy", which went straight to number one. [...] "Mercy" [...] was the last song written for the album. The single was physically released on 25 February 2008. She revealed that both [...] "Mercy" [...] and [...] "Stepping Stone" [...] are autobiographical; [...] "Mercy" [...] is about [...] "sexual liberty" [...] and [...] "not doing something somebody else wants you to do", and [...] "Stepping Stone" [...] is about not expressing her feelings to a person she fell in love with. [...] "Warwick Avenue" [...] was the second single released from the album. The song occurred when Duffy, then 19 years old, was familiarising herself with the London Underground and accidentally found herself at the Warwick Avenue station. The following day the song [...] "just sort of came out". At first the video for the song was meant to be an elaborate production but ended up a tearful <b>head</b> <b>shot</b> in a taxi cab with Duffy's mascara smudging. Duffy has said [...] "That's as close as I'm ever going to get to doing a performance that's real in a video." ...|$|E
