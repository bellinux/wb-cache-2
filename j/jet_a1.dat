25|$|In {{the effort}} to develop an {{aviation}} biofuel, Air New Zealand and Boeing researched the jatropha plant {{to see if it}} was a viable green alternative to conventional fuel. A two-hour test flight, using a 50-50 mixture of the new biofuel with Jet A-1 feeding a Rolls Royce RB-211 engine of one of the airline's 747-400s, was completed on 30 December 2008. The engine was then removed to be scrutinised and studied to identify any differences between the jatropha blend and regular <b>Jet</b> <b>A1.</b> No effects to performances were found. The use of jatropha has been identified as a possible future fuel but large tracts of low quality land needed to grow the plant would have to be found without impeding other agricultural uses.|$|E
500|$|In December 2008 an Air New Zealand jet {{completed}} the world's first commercial aviation test flight partially using jatropha-based fuel. [...] More {{than a dozen}} performance tests were undertaken in the two-hour test flight which departed from Auckland International Airport. A biofuel blend of 50:50 jatropha and <b>Jet</b> <b>A1</b> fuel was used to power one of the Boeing 747-400's Rolls-Royce RB211 engines. Air New Zealand set several criteria for its jatropha, requiring that [...] "the land it came from was neither forest nor virgin grassland in the previous 20 years, that the soil and climate it came from is not suitable {{for the majority of}} food crops and that the farms are rain fed and not mechanically irrigated". The company has also set general sustainability criteria, saying that such biofuels must not compete with food resources, that they must be as good as traditional jet fuels, and that they should be cost competitive.|$|E

25|$|The airline {{bought two}} Piper PA-22 Tri-Pacers in 1962 and a Cessna 185 two years later. The Seabees and the Cornells were retired in 1965, {{followed}} by the Tri-Pacers a year after. They were replaced with a Maule M-4, but also this was retired after two years. Instead Mørefly shifted focus to the helicopter market. The first helicopter, a Bell 47G4, was bought in 1966. It was supplemented with a -J2 variant on pontoons the following year. A Bell 206 <b>A1</b> <b>Jet</b> Ranger was procured in 1968 and was intended for search and rescue and cargo flights.|$|R
50|$|A major {{development}} {{is the use of}} small jet turbine engines in hobbyist models, both surface and air. Model-scale turbines resemble simplified versions of turbojet engines found on commercial aircraft, but are in fact new designs (not based upon scaled-down commercial jet engines.) The first hobbyist-developed turbine was developed and flown in the 1980s by Gerald Jackman in England, but only recently has commercial production (from companies such as Evojet in Germany) made turbines readily available for purchase. Turbines require specialized design and precision-manufacturing techniques (some designs for model aircraft have been built from recycled turbocharger units from car engines), and consume a mixture of <b>A1</b> <b>jet</b> fuel and synthetic turbine engine or motorcycle-engine oil. These qualities, and the turbine's high-thrust output, makes owning and operating a turbine-powered aircraft prohibitively expensive for most hobbyists, as well as many nations' national aeromodeling clubs (as with the USA's AMA) requiring their users to be certified to know how to safely and properly operate the engines they intend to use for such a model. Jet-powered models attract large crowds at organized events; their authentic sound and high speed make for excellent crowd pleasers.|$|R

50|$|A 2013-2014 study jointly {{hosted by}} NASA, German {{aerospace}} center DLR, and Canada's National Research Council NRC, determined that biofuels could reduce contrail generation. This reduction was explained by demonstrating that biofuels produce fewer soot particles, {{which are the}} nuclei around which the ice crystals form. The tests were performed by flying a DC-8 at cruising altitude with a sample-gathering aircraft flying in trail. In these samples, the contrail-producing soot particle count was reduced by 50 to 70 percent, using a 50% blend of conventional <b>Jet</b> <b>A1</b> fuel and HEFA (hyprocessed esters and fatty acids) biofuel produced from camelina.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, {{the airport}} opened its new 'City Heliport' facility, {{aimed at the}} {{commercial}} helicopter charter market, expanding and complementing the existing services provided at the Airport. The heliport features a dedicated <b>jet</b> <b>A1</b> fuel facility, conference room, small office units and a dedicated passenger lounge. City Heliport (which is not licensed) can accept helicopters during the hours of darkness by arrangement. This facility is used particularly during football matches at nearby Old Trafford, (Manchester United) and City of Manchester Stadium (Manchester City).

5000|$|Jet fuel freeze {{temperatures}} {{range between}} -40 and -50 C. These temperatures are frequently encountered at cruise altitude {{throughout the world}} with no effect since the fuel retains heat from lower elevations, but the intense cold and extended duration of polar flights may cause fuel temperature to approach its freezing point. Jet A grade with a maximum freeze point of -40 C {{is used in the}} U.S., while <b>Jet</b> <b>A1</b> grade with a maximum freeze point of -47 C is used elsewhere. [...] Modern long-distance airliners are equipped to alert flight crew when fuel temperatures reach [...] above these levels. The crew must then change altitude, though in some cases due to the low stratosphere over polar regions and its inversion properties the air may actually be somewhat warmer at higher altitudes.|$|E

A tandem and sport skydiving company (Skydive Ballistic Blondes) operates from their base on Domain Road. Helicopter operators Skywork and Twin Coast Helicopters both operate from the airport. One aircraft maintenance facility (Northland Aviation Ltd) is available, which conducts maintenance for airlines and many aircraft across Northland. Private jets are also catered for when they arrive about twice a year, as well as larger group charters which are fairly common. [...] BP provide <b>Jet</b> <b>A1</b> and AVGAS on field for aviators.
