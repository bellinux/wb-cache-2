5000|$|Aleutian {{was thought}} to have sunk in very deep water and no salvage had been attempted. [...] In 1998 {{shipwreck}} historian Steve Lloyd researched the testimony from the Marine Board of <b>Inquiry</b> <b>hearing</b> that had been conducted after the sinking of Aleutian. Reconstructing testimony given by Aleutian's officers he estimated {{the course of the}} ship just before the pinnacle rock had inflicted its mortal blow. In 2002 he began a side-scan sonar and a magnetometer search of the sea floor beginning at the rock that had sunk the ship. (The rock was later marked with a navigation aid and named Aleutian Rock to honor the deceased crew member.) On 14 August 2002 the searchers found a metallic target on the seabed. [...] The discovery was confirmed when a diver descended for an inspection. On the bottom, still upright, lay Aleutian. Her wreck is located just off the southern tip of Amook Island, about midway down the length of Uyak Bay at Kodiak Island. In 2003 Lloyd sought salvage rights to the wreck. [...] "The cargo's still in the hold. The furniture is still in the stateroom ... spittoons still in the gentlemen's smoking room…Portions of the superstructure have collapsed, and almost all the wood is gone. But sections of the deck were steel and are still there." [...] In 2004 the wreck site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. [...] In December 2005 the state of Alaska and the discoverer’s exploration company reached a settlement that would allow artifact recovery in compliance with state’s Office of History and Archeology and environmental regulations. [...] Aleutian is slowly deteriorating from the effects of saltwater corrosion and time. Despite the ship’s rapid sinking and time underwater she is nonetheless remarkably intact. The depth, current, and low visibility of her resting place makes her accessible only to experienced deep-wreck divers with advanced training and certification.|$|E

Capitalism requires failure and bankruptcy as a consequence in order to guide behavior.

After historic cross-party agreement, Parliament passed a resolution accepting a Royal Charter which adopted the great majority of his recommendations. In response, Britain's main national newspapers have pursued a campaign of systematic misinformation and distortion, aimed at discrediting the inquiry, its supporters and the cross-party Charter, while promoting a different system which would remain almost wholly controlled by the industry and would in practice be little different from the discredited Press Complaints Commission.
