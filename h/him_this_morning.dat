6000|$|... "Haven't seen <b>him</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> Father Agustin {{believes}} he'll {{respect the}} wish of the majority, although the fellows {{who did the}} fighting are all on his side." ...|$|E
60|$|Lane {{was indeed}} {{grateful}} for a change. Mel had been unaccountably depressed during those gloomy days. And it worried <b>him</b> that <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> {{she did not}} appear her usual self.|$|R
5000|$|... "I brought <b>him</b> in <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> {{from school}} to train with the first-team and he's {{going back to school}} this afternoon. He has got good {{movement}} and I liked what I saw.|$|R

6000|$|... "Simply this," [...] {{answered}} Richard. [...] "That I knew of {{what had}} happened in New York, and when I met <b>him</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> I cowhided him. Ugh!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} no speech with him. He but reached the castle, himself, late last night, and I first saw <b>him</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> {{when he came to}} {{announce}} your presence." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Only {{entering}} in my diary that I accepted <b>him</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> for pity's sake, {{in spite}} of Uncle Abner. They'll say {{it was for the}} title, but knowing it was not I don't care.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{know him}} by sight,' said Mrs Brown, whose working mouth and nodding head stopped for the moment, in the fixedness of her attention. 'We saw <b>him</b> pass <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> afore {{he got off}} his horse; when you were ready to take it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Gone!' {{repeated}} Harold. 'The farmer hunted <b>him</b> off <b>this</b> <b>morning!</b> Missus {{will have}} it that he's been stealing her eggs, {{and that there was}} a lantern in the stable on Friday night; so they told him to be off with him, and he's gone!' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Dear me," [...] said Mrs. Scott quickly. [...] "I {{forgot to}} say the horse cannot be found anywhere. Manuel must have taken <b>him</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> to look up the stock. But he will be back to-night certainly, and if to-morrow--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'A man sold <b>him</b> to me <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> Poor old Bob got poisoned. This one {{ought to}} be just as good a watch-dog. He barks loud enough.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dear tender soul,' whimpered a woman; 'and I said to <b>him</b> only <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> why don't you flog my boys, Master Hierax? how can {{you expect}} them to learn if they are not flogged?

6000|$|... 'Heard <b>him</b> telling Prater <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> Half {{the staff}} have gone. Good {{opportunity}} for a chap {{to go for a}} stroll if he wanted to. Shall we, by the way?' ...|$|R
