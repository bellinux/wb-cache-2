50|$|The Hare's Ear nymph is a {{fly fishing}} lure that is fished below the surface. It {{is thus a}} wet fly or nymph. It is an older pattern that imitates a variety of aquatic life, {{including}} scuds, <b>sow</b> <b>bugs,</b> mayfly nymphs, and caddis larvae.|$|R
40|$|Although Bacillus cereus {{sensu lato}} are {{important}} both from an ecological and an economical point of view, {{little is known}} about their population structure, ecology, and relationships with other organisms. In the present work, the genotypic similarity of arthropod-borne B. cereus s. l. isolates, and their symbiotic relationship with the host are assessed. Bacilli of this group were recovered from the digestive tracts of <b>sow</b> <b>bugs</b> (Porcellio scaber) collected in three closely located sites. Their genotypic diversity was investigated using pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) following the whole-genome DNA digestions with NotI and AscI, and PCR amplification of virulence genes. The majority of the sow-bug Bacillus cereus sensu stricto isolates originating from the same but also from different sites displayed identical PFGE patterns, virulence gene content and enterotoxicity, indicating strong genetic and genomic relationships. The sow-bug Bacillus mycoides/Bacillus pseudomycoides strains displayed a higher diversity. The isopod-B. cereus s. l. relationship was also evaluated using antibiotic-resistant derivatives of B. cereus s. s., B. mycoides/B. pseudomycoides and Bacillus thuringiensis reintroduced into <b>sow</b> <b>bugs.</b> Both spores and vegetative cells of B. cereus s. l. were recovered from <b>sow</b> <b>bugs</b> over a 30 -day period, strongly suggesting that these bacteria are natural residents of terrestrial isopods...|$|R
50|$|Storeria dekayi {{primarily}} {{feeds on}} slugs, snails, and earthworms. Reports of other invertebrates (e.g., <b>sow</b> <b>bugs,</b> mites, millipedes) {{in the diet}} of S. dekayi are most likely the result of accidental ingestion. For example, during predation,invertebrates may adhere to a slug being consumed by a snake.|$|R
50|$|All plethodonid {{salamanders}} are territorial, {{and fight}} aggressively for territory. Their preferred habitat is in moist soil or leaf litter beneath stones, rotting logs, or other debris near a permanent water source. They sometimes {{make use of}} other animals' burrows. Their diet consists primarily of ants, beetles, <b>sow</b> <b>bugs,</b> and earthworms, but they will consume most kinds of insect.|$|R
50|$|H. striatula eats invertebrates. It feeds almost {{exclusively}} on earthworms, although slugs, snails, <b>sow</b> <b>bugs,</b> insect eggs and larvae have also {{been found in the}} stomach. H. striatula is not venomous and does not constrict prey; rather, it swallows prey without subduing it. The pointed snout of the rough earth snake helps in burrowing in moist soil where prey are found.|$|R
40|$|The {{filamentous}} spore-forming bacterium Arthromitus, {{discovered in}} termites, millipedes, <b>sow</b> <b>bugs</b> and other soil-dwelling arthropods by Leidy (1850), is the intestinal stage of Bacillus cereus. We extend {{the range of}} Arthromitus habitats to include the hindgut of Blaberus giganteus, the large tropical American cockroach. The occurrence and morphology of the intestinal form of the bacillus were compared in individual cockroaches (n= 24) placed on four different diet regimes: diurnally maintained insects fed (1) dog food, (2) soy protein only, (3) purified cellulose only, and (4) a dog food-fed group maintained in continuous darkness. Food quality exerted strong influence on population densities and developmental stages of the filamentous bacterium and on fecal pellet composition. The most dramatic rise in Arthromitus populations, defined as the spore-forming filament intestinal stage, occurred in adult cockroaches {{kept in the dark}} on a dog food diet. Limited intake of cellulose or protein alone reduced both the frequency of Arthromitus filaments and the rate of weight gain of the insects. Spores isolated from termites, <b>sow</b> <b>bugs,</b> cockroaches and moths, grown on various hard surfaces display a branching mobility and resistance to antibiotics characteristic to group I Bacilli whose members include B. cereus, B. circulans, B. alvei and B. macerans. DNA isolated from pure cultures of these bacilli taken from the guts of Blaberus giganteus (cockroach), Junonia coenia (moth), Porcellio scaber (<b>sow</b> <b>bug)</b> and Cryptotermes brevis (termite) and subjected to Southern hybridization with a 23 S- 5 S B. subtilis ribosomal sequence probe verified that they are indistinguishable from laboratory strains of Bacillus cereus...|$|R
5000|$|The {{western skink}} is a secretive and very agile lizard that forages {{actively}} through leaf litter and dense vegetation, preying upon small invertebrates including spiders,a variety of insects and <b>sow</b> <b>bugs.</b> Crickets, beetles, moths, grasshoppers, and other arthropods {{have been found}} in the stomachs of skinks. [...] Prey is sometimes stalked and cannibalism has been reported. It is a good burrower and sometimes constructs burrows several times its own body length.|$|R
40|$|In {{the guts}} of more than 25 species of {{arthropods}} we observed filaments containing refractile inclusions previously discovered and named "Arthromitus" in 1849 by Joseph Leidy [Leidy, J. (1849) Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia 4, 225 - 233]. We cultivated these microbes from boiled intestines of 10 different species of surface-cleaned soil insects and isopod crustaceans. Literature review and these observations lead us to conclude that Arthromitus are spore-forming, variably motile, cultivable bacilli. As long rod-shaped bacteria, they lose their flagella, attach by fibers or fuzz to the intestinal epithelium, grow filamentously, and sporulate from their distal ends. When these organisms are incubated in culture, their life history stages are accelerated by light and inhibited by anoxia. Characterization of new Arthromitus isolates from digestive tracts of common <b>sow</b> <b>bugs</b> (Porcellio scaber), roaches (Gromphodorhina portentosa, Blaberus giganteus) and termites (Cryptotermes brevis, Kalotermes flavicollis) identifies these flagellated, spore-forming symbionts as a Bacillus sp. Complete sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene from four isolates (two <b>sow</b> <b>bug,</b> one hissing roach, one death's head roach) confirms these as the low-G+C Gram-positive eubacterium Bacillus cereus. We suggest that B. cereus and its close relatives, easily isolated from soil and grown on nutrient agar, enjoy filamentous growth in moist nutrient-rich intestines of healthy arthropods and similar habitats...|$|R

40|$|Laboratory {{studies of}} {{respiration}} in the <b>sow</b> <b>bug,</b> Porcellio scaber, reveal that respiration rates {{are related to}} genetic variation at the lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh) locus. In population samples taken from Burlington, North Carolina and Pacific Grove, California, respiration rates differed among Ldh genotypes, but not among genotypes at the other enzyme polymorphisms. In both population samples, the respiration rate of the common Ldh homozygote exceeded the respiration rate of the heterozygote by more than 50 per cent. The differences in respiration rates are consistent with previously reported viability differentials at the Ldh polymorphism...|$|R

50|$|Trilobites are {{the primary}} fossil remains found in the rocks of the Manuels River. These prehistoric animals lived on the seabed and left trails as they crawled around in search of food. Trilobites {{resemble}} <b>sow</b> <b>bugs</b> (commonly known as 'carpenters') or crabs and were first discovered along the river in 1874 by T.C. Weston of the Geological Survey of Canada. Complete specimens are rare, however, some have been found measuring as long as 30 cm.

40|$|ReportThis study {{compared}} {{the effect of}} turfgrass pest management tactics, available to homeowners, on beneficial and nontarget soil fauna. Management products tested included insecticides Merit, Dylox, and Sulfur, an insect growth inhibitor Mach 2, and a natural enemy or biological control, nematodes. To measure numbers of nontarget organisms samples were taken from treated and untreated turf plots using pitfall traps, soil cores, and baited ant traps from June through September. We found numbers of beetles, spiders, <b>sow</b> <b>bugs,</b> earthworms, ants, and crickets in treated plots were not significantly lower than numbers in control plots. Using this information, decisions for treatment of turfgrass and educational materials on turfgrass management {{will be able to}} include consideration for the impact on nontarget beneficial organisms...|$|R
50|$|About {{two-thirds of}} the diet of an adult {{consists}} of insects and other invertebrates. The remainder of the bird's diet {{is made up of}} wild fruits or berries. Favored insect foods include grasshoppers, crickets, katydids, and beetles. Other food items include earthworms, spiders, millipedes, centipedes, <b>sow</b> <b>bugs,</b> and snails.Fruits are especially important when insects are scarce in the winter. Some preferred winter food sources include dogwood, hawthorn, wild grape, and sumac, and hackberry seeds. Supplemental fruits eaten include black raspberries, bayberries, fruit of honeysuckle, Virginia creeper, eastern juniper, and pokeberries. Bluebirds feed by perching on a high point, such as a branch or fence post, and swooping down to catch insects on or near the ground. The availability of a winter food source will often determine whether or not a bird will migrate. If bluebirds do remain in a region for the winter, they group and seek cover in heavy thickets, orchards, or other areas in which adequate food and cover resources are available.|$|R
50|$|Its diet {{consists}} of mostly small insects, such as caterpillars, beetle larvae, earthworms, centipedes, slugs, and <b>sow</b> <b>bugs.</b> It will also eat from the corpses of dead animals, and {{small amounts of}} seeds or fruits. This shrew will eat its prey whole, but when eating crickets and grasshoppers, the North American least shrew will bite off the head of its prey and eat only the internal organs. When fighting a larger creature, it will aim for the legs and try to cripple its adversary, and will bite lizards, which are often too large for it to kill, on the tail, which then falls off and provides it with a meal while the lizard escapes. The North American least shrew will also sometimes live inside beehives and eat all the larvae. It will often share its food with other shrews. It eats more than its body weight each day and is known to store excessive amounts of food for later.|$|R

40|$|Two {{bacterial}} species (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus ubtilis) {{isolated from}} pigeon droppings, displayed anti Cryptococcus neoformans activity on 4 of 6 media nd sterilized pigeon droppings. Acanthamoeba palestinensis trophozoites isolated from pigeon droppings ingested and killed 99. 9 % of C. neoformans cells after 7 days of incubation. Mites and <b>sow</b> <b>bugs</b> (Metoponorthus pruinosus) i olated from pigeon droppings {{appear to be}} fungivorous. These findings uggest that many organisms that occur in pigeon droppings influence C. neoformans persistence, reproduction, morphology and distribution i nature. Cryptococcus neoformans has been found worldwide, usually in soils containing pigeon droppings. Staib [16, 17] reported that pigeon droppings provide an excellent culture medium for Cryptococcus spp. In addition, he reported that fresh canary and pigeon excreta containing C. neoformans became free of the yeast after 6 days of incubation because of decomposition and alkalinization by bacteria. Walter & Yee [21] failed to isolate C. neoformans from chicken droppings. They suggested {{that this could be}} due to their high alkalinity and the presence of low molecular weight, thermostable, growth-suppressing substance(s) in this material. Littman & Borok [10...|$|R
