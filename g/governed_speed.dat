Note that no fuel is used on the mis-fire strokes.|$|E

50|$|After World War I, in {{the frames}} of the Ganz Works, Kálmán Kandó {{constructed}} one-phase railway electric system of 16 kV and 50 Hz incipient {{all over the}} world. Its main attribute was the feed by normal network, so additional power station became unnecessary. Consequently, Hungarian electric traction could be formed according to the country's energy management. Kálmán Kandó adapted the speed-torque curve to electric traction through changing the phase number and pole number. Kálmán Kandó incorporated a phase shifter in the locomotives which <b>governed</b> <b>speed</b> levels.|$|E
50|$|Variable {{speed was}} {{obtained}} using a rotating metal disc driving a rubber wheel resting against it. The {{position of the}} wheel could be moved in and out along a radius of the disc, so that the wheel turned at different speeds (faster the further out). Operating errors would occur from adjusting the wheel, as the wheel tended to slide as it was dragged {{across the face of}} the spinning disc as it was adjusted. The workaround adopted was to adjust the rate quickly and in a discrete manner, accepting that the generated ranges would deviate moderately from the desired continuous hyperbolic curves that predominated in use. In 1909, alterations were made to the clockwork drive to improve reliability of the <b>governed</b> <b>speed</b> and to increase the power of the drive.|$|E
50|$|The M18 Hellcat (officially {{designated}} the 76 mm Gun Motor Carriage M18 or M18 GMC) was an American tank destroyer of World War II, {{used in the}} Italian, European, and Pacific theatres, and in the Korean War. It was the fastest American tracked armored vehicle until the turboshaft-powered M1 Abrams main battle tank appeared decades later. Even then, most sources list the M1 Abrams with {{a top speed of}} only 45 mph (<b>governed</b> <b>speed),</b> leaving the Hellcat with a superior paved-road top operating speed. The speed was attained by keeping armor to a minimum, no more than one inch thick and roofless, and by powering the relatively small vehicle with a radial engine originally designed for aircraft usage. The Hellcat, along with the M4 Sherman-based M10 tank destroyer and the highly effective, 90mm gun-armed M36 tank destroyer, provided American and Allied forces with a mobile anti-tank capability against the newer German armored types.|$|E

50|$|The M18 Hellcat (officially {{designated}} the 76 mm Gun Motor Carriage M18 or M18 GMC for short) was an American tank destroyer of World War II, {{used in the}} Italian, European, and Pacific theatres, and in the Korean War. It was the fastest armored vehicle in the American defense inventory of the 20th century, until the turboshaft-powered M1 Abrams heavy main battle tank appeared decades later. Even then, most sources list the M1 Abrams with {{a top speed of}} only 45 mph (<b>governed</b> <b>speed),</b> leaving the Hellcat with a superior paved-road top operating speed. The speed was attained by keeping armor to a minimum, no more than one inch thick and roofless, open-top turrets (a standard design feature for all American fully tracked tank destroyers of World War II) and by powering the relatively small vehicle with a radial engine originally designed for aircraft usage. The Hellcat, along with the M4 Sherman-based M10 tank destroyer and the highly effective, 90mm gun-armed M36 tank destroyer, provided American and Allied forces with a respectable mobile anti-tank capability against the newer German armored types. Despite being armed with an only partially effective 76 mm cannon, it performed well.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of contrast and color on perceived motion {{was measured using}} a speed-matching task. Observers adjusted the speed of an L cone contrast pattern to match that {{of a variety of}} colored test patterns. The dependence of speed on test contrast was the same for all test colors measured, differing only by a sensitivity factor. This result suggests that the reduced apparent speed of low contrast targets and certain colored targets is caused by a common cortical mechanism. The cone contrast levels that equate perceived speed differ substantially from those that equate visibility. This result suggests that the neural mechanisms <b>governing</b> <b>speed</b> perception and visibility differ. Perceived speed differences caused by variations in color can be explained by color responses that are characteristic of motion-selective cortex...|$|R
50|$|Records {{show that}} {{approximately}} {{one hundred and}} sixty-seven Streco Turnpike Cruisers were built, and fourteen amusement parks {{are known to have}} ordered the cars, which were powered by single-cylinder Kohler Company K-Series engines through matched centrifugal clutches at <b>governed</b> <b>speeds</b> of approximately six to eight miles per hour in single file along pre-fixed guideways and/or on winding pathways and, in some parks, with a fixed center guiderail to limit lateral motion. Streco Turnpike Cruiser bodies were constructed of solid fiberglass, and featured prominent tailfins (in conjunction with the fashion of the period), and also full wraparound bumpers for driver/passenger protection. The first series Streco cars were distinguished by standard twin-headlamp configurations, with the more rugged second series cars distinguishable by their quad headlamps.|$|R

5000|$|These {{were simple}} engines {{compared}} to modern engine design. However, they incorporate some very clever designs in several areas, many times because the designer {{was attempting to}} circumvent infringing a patent for a particular part of the engine. This is particularly true {{in the area of}} the governor. Governors are centrifugal, swinging arm, pivot arm, and many others. The actuator mechanism to <b>govern</b> <b>speed</b> is also varied depending on patents existing and the governor used. See, for example, U.S. Patents 543,157 from 1895 or 980,658 from 1911. However accomplished, the governor has one job - to control the speed of the engine. In modern engines, power output is controlled by throttling the flow of the air through the intake by means of a butterfly valve; the only exception to this being in diesels and Valvetronic petrol engines.|$|R
