The present paper describes the long term effects in rats of one time exposure to potroom aluminium oxide without <b>fluorides</b> (primary <b>alumina</b> (PA)) or with adsorbed <b>fluorides</b> (secondary <b>alumina</b> (SA)) on components of BAL fluid. Alumina dust (40 mg) suspended in saline was instilled intratracheally; controls received saline. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed one, four, and 12 months after exposure. The number of cells in BAL fluid was increased significantly (p < 0. 05) by SA but not PA. The increase was mainly macrophages, but the concentrations of neutrophils also increased about 10 -fold one and 12 months after exposure. Although albumin and hyaluronan concentrations {{did not differ from}} those of controls, fibronectin concentrations were significantly (p < 0. 001) increased one year after exposure both in PA exposed and SA exposed rats. The results indicate that SA, possibly because of adhered fluorides, induces early changes in alveolar cell populations including persistent neutrophilia. These cellular changes may have a destructive effect. The late pronounced increase of fibronectin in both PA and SA exposed rats indicates a delayed effect of alumina on the extracellular matrix...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{characterization}} of various oxide based materials, {{some of which are}} potential industrial catalysts. The major instrumental technique used in this work is infrared (IR) spectroscopy. To a lesser extent nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used. Also, attempts were made to correlate spectroscopic results with those from a standard test reaction which would allow us to rank moderate strength catalysts, based on their acidity. This test involved the isomerization of 2 -methyl- 2 -pentene (2 M 2 P). The isomerization of 2 M 2 P is a particularly useful reaction since the olefin can convert into a large number of products, the relative rates of formation of which reflect the acid strength of the catalyst. Halide containing solid acids are common catalysts, however the availability and use of halogen containing treatment gases in their preparation has come under increasing environmental scrutiny. As a result there is interest in developing alternative environmentally compatible halide free catalysts as replacements. Silica-aluminas are too acidic for this purpose. However, by adding weakly basic rare earth oxides to silica-alumina catalysts their overall acidity can be lowered to degrees comparable to halide containing acids. Yttria behaves {{in a manner similar to}} the rare earth oxides and was used for this purpose. Olefin model reactions, in particular the isomerization of 2 M 2 P, show that the acid strength of silica-aluminas can be adjusted to that of halided, chlorided or <b>fluorided,</b> <b>aluminas</b> with the addition of rare earth oxides in the 4 - 20 wt. ...|$|R

Characterization of XRD showed that five aluminas were poorly crystallized with different phases and their anion exchange capacity and the point of zero charge varied with the species of aluminas. The batch experiments (thermodynamics, kinetics {{and the effect of}} pH) were conducted to evaluate the fluoride adsorption behavior of different aluminas. For all aluminas, both Langmiur and Freundlich models fitted the adsorption isotherms well and the calculation of thermodynamics showed that adsorption was spontaneous and endothermic; the kinetics was well described by the pseudo-second-order model and the weak acidic pH favored the fluoride adsorption. Acidity/basicity of alumina exhibited significant effect on the behaviors of adsorption and the process of ion exchange in <b>fluoride</b> removal. Acidic <b>alumina</b> exhibited higher ion exchange capacity, more positively charged surface, and better defluoridation performance (higher adsorption capacity and quicker removal of <b>fluoride)</b> than basic <b>alumina.</b> Acidic alumina also showed higher efficiency when treating natural ground water without pH adjustment. The difference in the adsorption properties was ascribed to the different exchange sites and the different behaviors of anion exchange. In the case of acidic alumina, more Cl- was exchanged with fluoride and the adsorption/release of OH- was dependent on the initial fluoride concentration.

"nMaterials and Methods: Expriment in batch system and with change effective parameters such as pH(5, 7, 9), equilibration time (30, 60, 90, 120 minute), initial fluoride concentration(1. 4, 2, 2. 4 mg/l) and activated Alumina dosage (0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 3 gr/l) was investigated. Also found data of this research were fited with Langmuir and Freundlich models, kinetic data with pseudo- first order, pseudo- second order and modifited pseudo- first order  models. "nResults: The results showed that with increasing of pH of solution, removal efficiency was decreased and optimum pH was found to be in the range of 5 to 7. Also removal efficiency of fluoride was increased with increasing of adsorbent dosage and decreasing of initial concentration of fluoride.

40|$|Fluoride is a {{potentially}} toxic ion {{that occurs in}} aquifers both naturally {{and as a result}} of anthropogenic activity. Sometimes remediation of the aquifer is required. One potential aquifer decontamination strategy is an "interception-sorption trench"-one of a number of "reactive wall" technologies. This remediation strategy relies upon natural hydraulic gradients to transport the fluoride through the aquifer to the interception-sorption trench where it partitions onto a strong sorbent-alumina. In this paper, the focus is on the development and calibration of ail equilibrium-based geochemical model that will be employed in the development of a quantitative reactive transport model, which in turn will be used for the design of ail interception-sorption trench. The geochemical model described here takes into account a variety of ions likely to be present in a sandy aquifer, chemical activities, and the surface charge on the alumina. The model is calibrated over a wide pH range and for high initial fluoride concentrations using experimental results obtained from batch tests. It is found that pH dependent equilibrium constants are needed to capture the behavior of the experimentally observed fluoride sorption. The presence of sodium sulfate in Solution is investigated, and it is found that sodium significantly interferes with the sorption of <b>fluoride</b> onto <b>alumina</b> under alkaline conditions. The geochemical model indicates that under acidic conditions, the alumina may release potentially large and unacceptable concentrations of aluminum into the aquifer.

30|$|Ayoob et al. (2008) {{assessed}} the conceptual overview on sustainability of different defluoridation technologies {{and indicated that}} {{despite the fact that}} membrane and electrochemical techniques have high capacity of fluoride removal they are not widely used because they are costly and energy intensive. Adsorption is considered an appropriate technique for small community water source defluoridation compared to other techniques (Mohapatra et al. 2009). As a result, adsorption is frequently used as a robust technique to remove water soluble ions and an attractive method for the removal of fluoride in terms of low cost, simplicity of design, and operation (Tchomgui-Kamga et al. 2010 a; Miretzky and Cirelli 2011). Nevertheless, the applicability of low-cost adsorbents is limited either due to their low removal capacity or lack of public acceptance. For instance, adsorption of <b>fluoride</b> using activated <b>alumina</b> (Ghorai and Pant 2005), bone char (Leyva-Ramos et al. 2010), and clay materials (Meenakshi et al. 2008) was investigated and none of them is used in household or large-scale application.

Previous work has indicated that such coatings can fail by impact damage and by abrasion from the wire used to lower inspection tools down the tubular. The wire is commonly called "slickline" {{and the type of}} wear is called "wireline wear". However, the different wear mechanisms of thermoset and thermoplastic polymeric coatings under wireline wear conditions have not been clarified. Filler materials such as calcium silicate, calcium <b>fluoride</b> and <b>alumina</b> are often added to polymeric coatings to enhance the mechanical properties of the matrix materials; nevertheless, fillers can improve the wear resistance or exacerbate the wear rate of polymeric coatings depending on the characteristics of the filler material such as its shape, concentration, and the boundary condition between the filler and the matrix material. In this study, two types of thermoset polymeric coatings, a modified novolac containing calcium silicate fillers and a modified epoxy containing alumina as the filler, and one type of thermoplastic coating, a fluoropolymer with 2 % calcium fluoride filler, were selected for wear tests. The disc specimen in a pin-on-disc (POD) apparatus was modified to enable embedding a circular loop of wire into its surface. That arrangement was used to study the effect of normal force and sliding distance on wireline wear of the three polymeric coatings. Detailed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out on the wear tracks produced to investigate the wear mechanisms.

40|$|Aluminum is {{produced}} in electrolytic reduction cells where alumina feedstock is dissolved in molten cryolite (sodium aluminum fluoride) along with aluminum and calcium <b>fluorides.</b> The dissolved <b>alumina</b> is then reduced by electrolysis and the molten aluminum separates {{to the bottom of}} the cell. The reduction cell is periodically tapped to remove the molten aluminum. During the tapping process, some of the molten electrolyte (commonly referred as “bath” in the aluminum industry) is carried over with the molten aluminum and into the transfer crucible. The carryover of molten bath into the holding furnace can create significant operational problems in aluminum cast houses. Bath carryover can result in several problems. The most troublesome problem is sodium and calcium pickup in magnesium-bearing alloys. Magnesium alloying additions can result in Mg-Na and Mg-Ca exchange reactions with the molten bath, which results in the undesirable pickup of elemental sodium and calcium. This final report presents the findings of a project to evaluate removal of molten bath using a new and novel micro-porous filter media. The theory of selective adsorption or removal is based on interfacial surface energy differences of molten aluminum and bath on the micro-porous filter structure.

This study was conducted, therefore, to investigate the effect of natural organic matters (NOMs) on the removal of <b>fluoride</b> by activated <b>alumina</b> using response surface methodology. To the authors’ knowledge, this has not been previously investigated. Physico-chemical characterization of the alumina was determined by scanning electron microscope (SEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and X-ray diffractometer (XRD). Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to evaluate the effect of single and combined parameters on the independent variables such as the initial concentration of fluoride, NOMs, and pH on the process.

40|$|Highlights - Constant mass bottle-point method {{revealed}} that fluoride equilibrium uptake was unfavourable on <b>alumina.</b> - <b>Fluoride</b> sorption required modelling by multilayer isotherm expressions. - Both sorption mechanism and loading capacity of fluoride ions related to solution pH. - High alkalinity solutions required pH adjustment using HCl and not H 2 SO 4. - Activated alumina suitable for reducing fluoride levels in groundwater to meet regulatory guidelines. Abstract This study focussed on {{the differences in}} sorption behaviour of <b>fluoride</b> on activated <b>alumina,</b> between simple sodium fluoride solutions and multicomponent groundwater samples with high alkalinity. It was our hypothesis that: fluoride uptake may be inhibited {{by the presence of}} bicarbonate ions: the separation mechanism may involve multiple pathways which have not been identified previously due to inappropriate bottle-point approaches; groundwater pH is critical; and methods of pH modification are important. Equilibrium studies of alkaline UOP-A 201 <b>alumina</b> with sodium <b>fluoride</b> solutions showed that the isotherm was unfavourable in character (due to competition with hydroxyl species) in contrast to existing literature which suggested it was favourable. The monolayer capacities of the alumina depended upon pH, with fluoride uptakes of 6. 63, 29. 8, and 23. 78 g F/kg alumina predicted at pH values of 8, 6, and 4, respectively. Evidence for multilayer sorption was apparent at pH 8 and 4, and as such the Aranovich Donohue model successfully simulated isotherm behaviour. Column studies of sodium fluoride solutions resulted in diminished operational fluoride loadings (1. 05 – 1. 29 g F/kg alumina) due possibly to high pH of the exchange environment. Adjustment of solution pH using sulphuric acid was detrimental to fluoride uptake due to competitive interactions between fluoride and sulphate ions for adsorption sites. In a column study, fluoride was effectively removed from an acid dosed groundwater sample from the Surat Basin in Queensland, with almost 800 bed volumes of water treated prior to break through of the 2 mg/L discharge limit. The groundwater was pre-treated with hydrochloric acid (ca. pH 5. 2) to decompose high concentrations of bicarbonate ions which reduce fluoride uptake. Operating capacity of the alumina was 2. 94 g F/kg alumina which was substantially less than fluoride capacities estimated from equilibrium isotherms but greater than column studies with sodium fluoride solutions...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} a number of aspects {{governing}} the transformation of gibbsite, via intermediate phases, to #alpha#-alumina. These aspects include the size and morphology of the gibbsite grains, the influence of additions of foreign elements, the effect of a mechanical treatment of the gibbsite prior to calcination, and combinations of these factors. The materials were characterised by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and surface area measurements. For some of the calcined materials an attempt was made to sinter the powders to a dense body to investigate if any of the treatments during calcination had an effect on this process. The literature review covers the current state of understanding of the production of bulk alumina powder by the Bayer process and the phase changes seen on calcination of precursors to the stable #alpha#-alumina phase. A detailed description of the phase changes is given and the various routes and conditions necessary for the transformations to occur are considered. The transformations are examined in relation to the morphology of the crystals and the variables controlling the phase transformation route are discussed. Calcination in air showed that the size of the gibbsite grain governs the calcination route taken to reach oc-alumina. The standard gibbsites used in this work show a mixed calcination sequence transforming both via the boehmite phase, followed by the #gamma#, #delta# and #theta# phases, and via the #chi# and #kappa# phases. The formation of boehmite is attributed to retention of water vapour within the grain. Differences in morphology of the starting materials showed that for the range of materials seen, the morphology of the grain is less important than its size. The super fine material confirmed that a small grain size transforms via the non-boehmite route only, with the other gibbsites taking intermediate routes as for the standard gibbsites. Of the additions made prior to calcination, aluminium fluoride was found to reduce the transformation temperature to #alpha#-alumina by approximately 300 deg. C. Other additions had little effect on the transformation temperature although a reduction in grain size was seen with aluminium chloride. It was found that good mixing of the <b>alumina</b> <b>fluoride</b> was essential to obtain reliable and reproducible results. This is due to the small amounts of additive that are needed and the sensitivity of the process to concentration variations. Mineralisation of a range of gibbsites showed that the presence of sodium in the starting material was crucial in reducing the calcination temperature. This led {{to the conclusion that the}} sodium and fluoride react to form a liquid phase. The presence of a liquid phase increases the mobility of the aluminium and oxygen atoms resulting in a reduction of the transformation temperature. Fluoride additions to the gibbsites with different morphologies showed that the presence of sodium was the governing factor in reduction of the transformation temperature. Milling of the starting materials showed that there was a small reduction in the transformation temperature between some of the phases. The energy involved in milling leads to activation of the gibbsite. This activation takes the form of a reduction in the grain size and in a reduction of the crystallinity seen in the XRD pattern. Fluoride additions during the calcination of sapphire with a standard gibbsite powder showed preferential grain growth. It was possible to initiate growth of small plate-like crystals on the polished surface of a piece of sapphire parallel to the basal plane. Crystal growth was also seen in scratches on a polished surface perpendicular to the basal plane.

40|$|Groundwater is a {{major and}} {{sometimes}} lone source of drinking water worldwide. The chemical composition of groundwater is a combined product of the composition of water that enters the aquifer and its reaction with various minerals present in the soil and rock mass, which alter the water composition with time and space. Some important factors influencing groundwater quality are (1) physiochemical characteristics o the rocks through which the water circulates; (2) geology of the location; (3) climate of the area; (4) role of microorganisms, which includes oxidative and reductive biodegradation of organic matter; (5) chemical, physical, and mineralogical characteristics of the overburden soils through which the rainwater percolates; and (6) human intrusion affecting the hydrological cycle and degradation in water quality through utilization of water for agricultural and industrial activities. By far the most serious naturally occurring groundwater-quality problem in India derives from high fluoride, arsenic and iron concentrations which are dissolved from the bedrocks by geochemical processes. Presence of excess fluoride in groundwater is identified as a naturally occurring health hazard by the World Health Organization (WHO). Prolonged ingestion of fluoride beyond certain permissible limit leads to ffluorosis, {{one of the common}} water-related diseases recognized by the WHO and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). Endemic fluorosis is now known to be global in scope, occurring on all continents and affecting many millions of people. According to estimates made in the early 1980 s, around 260 million people in 30 countries worldwide were drinking water with more than 1 ppm of fluoride. The ultimate source of fluoride in water, soil or biosphere is associated with its distribution in rocks and its dispersion in groundwater. The three most important minerals of fluoride are fluorite (CaF 2), cryolite (Na 3 AlF 6) and fluorapatite (Ca 5 (PO 4) 3 F); cryolite is a rare mineral where as by far the largest amount of fluorine in the earth's crust {{is in the form of}} fluorapatite (about 3. 5 % by weight of fluorine) which is processed almost exclusively for its phosphate content. Fluoride substitutes readily in hydroxyl positions in late-formed minerals in igneous rocks, and in primary minerals especially micas (such as biotites) and amphiboles (such as hornblende). The most important controlling factors influencing fluoride presence in groundwater include: distribution of easily weathered fluoride-bearing minerals, the accessibility of circulating water to these minerals, pH of the percolating water, calcium content of the leaching water, temperature of the percolating water and the soil, exchangeable ions in the percolating water, extent of fresh water exchange in an aquifer, evaporation and evapotranspiration, complexing of fluoride ions with other ions, presence of CO 2 and other chemicals in draining water and residence time of the percolating water in soil. High fluoride levels are observed in the groundwater in 19 states of the country. Fluorite, apatite, rock phosphate, phosphorites, phosphatic nodules and topaz are major fluoride bearing minerals in India with varying levels of fluoride content. There are three major fluoride bearing areas in India : 1) Gujarat-Rajasthan in the north-west and 2) Chandidongri-Raipur in central India 3) Tamil Nadu-Andhra Pradesh in the south; besides other areas in Karnataka, Bihar, Punjab and in the North-west Himalayas. The total mineral reserves of fluorite, rock phosphate and apatite in the country are estimated at 11. 6, 71 and 2. 82 million tonnes respectively. The distribution of areas with excess fluoride in groundwater concurs with that of fluorine-bearing minerals. Further high fluoride concentrations are observed from arid and semi arid regions of the country and the areas with advanced stage of groundwater development. An estimated 62 million people, including 6 million children suffer from fluorosis in India because of consuming fluoride-contaminated water. Endemic fluorosis is found to practically exist only in the villages due to lack of piped water supply. The Indian Drinking Water Standard specifies the desirable and permissible limits for fluoride in drinking water as 1. 0 and 1. 5 ppm respectively. De-fluoridation of groundwater is the only alternative to prevent fluorosis in the absence of alternate water source especially for immediate and/or interim relief. De-fluoridation of drinking water in India is usually achieved by the Nalgonda technique or activated alumina process. The Nalgonda method involves addition of aluminum salts (aluminium sulphate and/or aluminium chloride), lime and bleaching powder to water, followed by rapid mixing, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration and disinfection. Only aluminum salt is responsible for removal of fluoride from water. Fluoride removal is achieved in a combination of complexation with polyhydroxy aluminium species and adsorption on polymeric alumino hydroxides (floc). Activated alumina(Al 2 O 3) was proposed for de-fluoridation of water for domestic use in 1930 ’s and since then it has become one of the most advocated de-fluoridation methods. Activated alumina is a semi crystalline porous inorganic adsorbent and an excellent medium for fluoride removal. When the source water passes through the packed column of activated <b>alumina,</b> <b>fluoride</b> (and other components in the water) is removed via exchange reaction with surface hydroxides on alumina; this mechanism is generally called adsorption although ligand exchange is a more appropriate term for the highly specific surface reactions involved. The fluoride removal capacity of alumina is highly sensitive to pH, the optimum being about pH 5. 5 - 6. Significant reduction in fluoride removal by activated alumina is also observed in presence of sulfate and silicate ions. The column needs periodic regeneration once break point(where the effluent concentration is, for example, 2 ppm at normal saturation) is reached. For regeneration, the medium is backwashed for 5 - 10 min and then subjected to two step regeneration with base (NaOH) followed by acid(H 2 SO 4). A major cause for concern with the Nalgonda method is the possibility of formation of residual aluminum and soluble aluminum fluoride complexes in the treated water and a potential breach of the 0. 2 ppm Indian drinking water standard for aluminium. Concerns with the activated alumina filter method are that the process is pH dependent, with an optimum (pH) working range of 5 - 6. Further, the activated alumina column requires periodic recharge using caustic soda and acid solutions to rejuvenate the fluoride retention capacity of the column. After 3 - 4 regenerations the medium has to be replaced. If the pH is not readjusted to normal following the regeneration process, there is a possibility that the aluminum concentration in the treated water may exceed the 0. 2 ppm standard. Due to the aforementioned drawbacks of the currentde-fluoridation technologies in India that chiefly rely on aluminum based compounds, magnesia(magnesium oxide, MgO) is selected to develop an alternate sustainable de-fluoridation method. The potential of MgO for de-fluoridation has been examined owing to its very limited solubility(6. 2 mg/L), non-toxicity and excellent fluoride retention capacity. A review of the previous studies on fluoride removal using MgO reveals that the relevant information is essentially scattered. Though studies demonstrated the fluoride removing ability of MgO and brought into focus certain aspects of the fluoride removal mechanism and change in water quality upon MgO addition, vital issues necessary for efficient design and successful field implementation of the de-fluoridation processusing MgO were not addressed. The significant limitations in the earlier works include: influence of process variables(such as MgO dosage, initial fluoride concentration, contact time, temperature, initial solution pH, presence of co-ions and ionic strength) on fluoride retention characteristics (such as removal rate, equilibrium time, capacity) of MgO were not systematically determined, optimum operating parameters/conditions (such as MgO dosage, stirring and settling time) for effective de-fluoridation process applicable to a wide range of groundwater chemical composition and fluoride concentrations were not defined, mechanism of fluoride retention by MgO was not fully understood, issue of lowering the pH of MgO treated water within potable water limits was not comprehensively addressed, safe disposal methods of fluoride bearing sludge were not explored. Failure to address the above issues has impeded the adoption of the MgO treatment method for fluoride removal from water. Scope of the study Present study aims to develop a new sustainable de-fluoridation method, applicable to a wide range of groundwater chemical compositions and fluoride concentrations, based on co-precipitation/precipitation-sedimentation-filtration processes using light MgO. Efforts are made to implement the method at domestic level in a rural area with incidence of high fluoride concentration in groundwater and to understand the status and geochemistry of fluoride contamination in the area. The main objectives of the study include: To determine the fluoride retention characteristics of MgO viz.,rate, equilibrium time and capacity of fluoride retention. To examine the influence of process variables on fluoride retention characteristics of MgO and to determine the optimum operating parameters for effective de-fluoridation process. To understand the mechanism and rate limiting step of MgO de-fluoridation process. To propose methods and specifications to lower the pH of MgO treated water within permissible limits to ensure its potability. To design a simple to use, single-stage domestic de-fluoridation unit. To propose procedures for implementation of the new de-fluoridation method in field. To evaluate the efficiency of the new de-fluoridation method as a useful remedial measure in the fluoride affected areas. To understand the geochemical factors governing the quality of the fluoride rich groundwater and to ascertain the status and geochemistry of fluoride contamination in the area where felid implementation of de-fluoridation method is planned. To characterize the fluoride bearing sludge and propose methods for safe disposal and reuse of fluoride bearing sludge. Organization of the thesis Chapter 1 presents an overview of the various aspects of excess fluoride presence in groundwater, remedial measures, and emphasizes the need for a new sustainable de-fluoridation method and defines the scope of present study. Chapter 2 performs a detailed investigation to determine the fluoride retention characteristics of MgO under the influence of various process variables at transient and equilibrium conditions using batch studies. The process variables that have been considered are, contact time, initial fluoride concentration, dosage of MgO, temperature, initial pH, presence of co-ions and ionic strength. Studies to determine the optimum operating parameters for efficient de-fluoridation and to understand some basics of reaction mechanisms involved are also part of this chapter. Chapter 3 examines the true nature of the reaction mechanism between fluoride ions and MgO in aqueous media and the rate-limiting step of the de-fluoridation process by investigating the hydration process of MgO and its influence/relation on fluoride removal. Chapter 4 addresses issues that will assist applying the MgO treatment method for fluoride removal in field such as 1) methods and specifications for lowering the pH of the MgO treated water within permissible limits, 2) design of a simple to use, single-stage de-fluoridation unit, and 3) characterization of the resultant fluoride bearing sludge. Chapter 5 performs a detailed investigation to evaluate the efficiency of the new de-fluoridation method in laboratory and field, and to understand the origin and the geochemicall mechanisms driving the groundwater fluorine enrichment in the area where field implementation of the de-fluoridation unit was planned. Chapter 6 explores an environmentally safe route for the disposal and re-use of fluoride bearing sludge in soil based building materials such as, stabilized soil blocks (produced by cement stabilization of densely compacted soil mass) which are alternative to burnt bricks. Chapter 7 summarizes the major results, observations and contributions from the study...|$|R
