40|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>sludge</b> is a thick viscous {{mixture of}} sediments, water, oil and hydrocarbons, {{encountered}} during crude oil refining, cleaning of oil storage vessels and waste treatment. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are components of crude <b>oil</b> <b>sludge,</b> constitute serious environmental concerns, {{as many of}} them are cytotoxic, mutagenic and potentially carcinogenic. Improper management and disposal of <b>oil</b> <b>sludge</b> causes environmental pollution. The adverse effects of <b>oil</b> <b>sludge</b> on soil ecology and fertility have been of growing interest among environmental scientist and an important consideration in the development of efficient technologies for remediation of contaminated land, with a view to making such land available for further use. <b>Oil</b> <b>sludge</b> can be treated by several methods such as physical, chemical and biological processes. The biological processes are mostly cost effective and environmentally friendly, as they are easy to design and implement, as such they are more acceptable to the public. Compost, the product of biological breakdown of organic matter is a rich source of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. These microorganisms can degrade the <b>oil</b> <b>sludge</b> to less toxic compounds such as carbon dioxide, water and salts. Compost bioremediation, the application of composting in remediation of contaminated environment, is beginning to gain popularity among remediation scientists.
