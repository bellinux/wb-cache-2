40|$|European {{standards}} {{regulate the}} <b>certification</b> <b>procedure</b> for determining chimney class temperature {{and the distance}} at which to install chimneys from combustible materials. These standards prescribe the heat stress test and the thermal shock test. The high number of roof fires due {{to the presence of}} a chimney that have recently occurred in European countries seems to be due to a weak <b>certification</b> <b>procedure.</b> In this article, experimental tests and numerical simulations have been performed to highlight the major differences between real and test conditions to identify critical aspects of the current <b>certification</b> <b>procedure.</b> The influence of the position of the chimney in the test structure, the thermocouples’ positioning and the thermal shock test initial condition have been investigated. It has been shown that flammable materials’ temperatures measured in the <b>certification</b> <b>procedure</b> can be lower than those in real installations, and this is mainly {{due to the fact that}} exhaust gas temperature in the <b>certification</b> <b>procedure</b> of chimneys can be even 350 °C lower than in real installations. Then, real installations represent a more severe condition...|$|R

30|$|Managerial hubris, {{likely in}} the absence of {{adequate}} information, may have {{played a significant role in}} <b>initial</b> <b>certification</b> decisions, but decertification decisions were based on more informed cost and benefit information. The results support our hypothesis that compared with <b>initial</b> <b>certification,</b> decertification decisions were better informed, calculated business decisions. For food processing firms, the results suggest the need for more careful estimation of benefits and costs and avoidance of managerial debris in order minimize any adverse firm performance and sunk costs associated with certification. For policymakers and the development community, the results suggest that an increased emphasis on policy measures aimed at discouraging decertification and actions to provide greater sustained incentives for food safety systems, versus a focus limited to capacity building to achieve <b>initial</b> <b>certification,</b> may be necessary to sustain food safety initiatives such as HACCP.|$|R
