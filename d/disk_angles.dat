40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{mechanisms}} behind {{the control of}} a typical two line kite, where the lines {{are attached to the}} kite side by side. This arrangement gives the kite flyer the ability to apply a roll angle to the kite, which then results in a yawing motion. The reason for this yaw rotation has not been adequately described previously. The definitions of roll and yaw for a kite have been re-defined to match the real world behaviour of the kite-bridle-line system. Specifically, these are defined as rotations relative to the lines rather than the kite itself. This detail has been neglected in previous research, and has a significant effect on the turning behaviour of a kite. A static model of a kite represented by flat disks was created. This model allows the out of balance forces and moments to be found for a kite when it is held at any position. When the kite is held with a roll angle applied, the <b>disk</b> <b>angles</b> of attack become unequal. This causes a change in the magnitude, direction, and point of action of the aerodynamic forces on each disk, which can lead to a yaw moment. While this does not give a complete picture of how a kite turns, it does explain one of the two mechanisms that cause a kite to begin to yaw when a roll angle is applied. The other mechanism is due to the velocity of the roll rotation, and is out of the scope of this thesis since a dynamic analysis would be required. The static model showed that any variation to kite geometry or any parameter that affects the equilibrium position of the kite will affect turning response. The most important of these parameters for a simple kite represented by two disks is the dihedral angle. A minimum negative dihedral angle (or anhedral) is required for a kite to turn in the expected direction when a roll angle is applied. The value of the minimum anhedral angle required for this behaviour varies with other parameters, but is generally between 8 ° and 20 °. Other parameters such as bridle geometry also affect the turning response of a kite, primarily because they alter the equilibrium positions of the kite and line. Altering these equilibrium positions has a strong effect on turning response, since it changes the initial <b>disk</b> <b>angles</b> of attack. Additionally, if the kite and line are not aligned perpendicular to each other (which is a rare condition for a kite) a roll angle further changes the <b>disk</b> <b>angles</b> of attack, since the roll angle is applied about an axis relative to the line rather than the kite. An investigation into the effect of varying wind velocity on turning response showed that it has an important effect. Some kites will reverse their response to a given roll angle at some wind velocities, which could make the kite very difficult to control. Additionally, some kites can alter their equilibrium positions sharply with wind velocity, again causing varying turning behaviour as the wind conditions change. Future work should examine the dynamic turning response of kites. A dynamic simulation could be used to examine how the turning response of a kite is influenced by the rate at which a control input is applied. Additionally, the behaviour of the kite once the initial turning movement has begun could be assessed...|$|E

Four MiTEs, extending from 50 - 60 %, 60 - 70 %, 70 - 80 % and 80 - 90 % span, were considered and actuated at frequencies of 1 /rev and 2 /rev. A gradient-based optimization scheme {{was used to}} determine the optimal deployment of the MiTEs, while satisfying vehicle trim. Studies were based on a UH- 60 type aircraft and the effect of the MiTEs was examined at moderate to very high speeds, and for low through high aircraft gross-weights. In the analysis lift and drag increments associated with MiTE deployment were added to airfoil properties of the base SC- 1095 airfoil. At very high gross-weights, or a combination of moderate weight and very high speed, large reductions in rotor power of up to 40 % were predicted, with the MiTEs working to alleviate rotor stall. The rotor <b>disk</b> <b>angles</b> of attack on the retreating side were significantly reduced, as was the drag over much of the retreating side. At moderate to low gross-weights and/or lower speeds, power reductions of up to 8. 74 % were still obtained, even when the baseline rotor was not stalled.

40|$|We perform {{two-dimensional}} axially symmetric radiation-hydrodynamic simulations {{to assess}} the impact of outflows and radiative force feedback from massive protostars by varying when the protostellar outflow starts, the ratio of ejection to accretion rates, and the strength of the wide <b>angle</b> <b>disk</b> wind component. The star formation efficiency, i. e. the ratio of final stellar mass to initial core mass, is dominated by radiative forces and the ratio of outflow to accretion rates. Increasing this ratio has three effects: First, the protostar grows slower with a lower luminosity at any given time, lowering radiative feedback. Second, bipolar cavities cleared by the outflow are larger, further diminishing radiative feedback on disk and core scales. Third, the higher momentum outflow sweeps up more material from the collapsing envelope, decreasing the protostar's potential mass reservoir via entrainment. The star formation efficiency varies with the ratio of ejection to accretion rates from 50 % in the case of very weak outflows to as low as 20 % for very strong outflows. At latitudes between the low density bipolar cavity and the high density accretion <b>disk,</b> wide <b>angle</b> <b>disk</b> winds remove some of the gas, which otherwise would be part of the accretion flow onto the disk; varying the strength of these wide <b>angle</b> <b>disk</b> winds, however, alters the final star formation efficiency by only +/- 6 %.

40|$|All massive nearby galaxies, {{including}} our own, host supermassive black holes. Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are seen when such black holes accrete, {{and when they}} produce powerful jets of synchrotron-emitting plasma, they are termed radio-loud AGN. The close correlation between black hole mass and galaxy bulge mass in elliptical galaxies indicates that AGN feedback {{may be the key}} to the regulation of galaxy formation. It is thus necessary to fully understand the structure of AGN, the way that they are fuelled, and their duty cycle, in order to study the feedback processes and get a clear picture of galaxy formation. In this thesis, independent methods are developed to constrain the accretion disk and radio jet angles to the line of sight. H IX emission from a sub-sample of high-redshift quasars is measured from near-infrared spectroscopy and modelled as sums of different components, including the characteristic double-peaked profile which results from a thin, rotating accretion disk. Comparing the models using Bayesian evidence, almost all quasars were found to have infrared spectra consistent with the presence of a disk. The jet inclination angles of the same set of quasars were constrained by fitting a model, including the effect of Doppler boosting and the receding torus model for dust obscuration, to the radio spectral energy distribution. The fitted <b>disk</b> and jet <b>angles</b> correlate strongly, and are consistent with a model in which the radio jets are launched orthogonally to the plane of the accretion disk, as expected if the jet is powered by energy drawn from the spin of the black hole. Both <b>disk</b> and jet <b>angles</b> correlate with the observed linear source size, which is a projection effect; when deprojected using the fitted angles, the distribution of source sizes agrees with a scenario in which the sources expand into the surrounding medium at a constant rate up to 1 Mpc and then shut off, probably as the nuclei become quiescent. The accretion <b>disk</b> <b>angle</b> was found to correlate weakly with the low-frequency radio luminosity, which provides direct, albeit tenuous, evidence for the receding torus model.

The hydrodynamic torque applied on the butterfly valve disk {{is one of the}} most important factors which should be considered in their design and application. Although several methods have been used to calculate the total torque on these valves, most of them are based on hydrostatic analysis and ignore the hydrodynamic effect which has a major role to determine the torque of the large-size valves.

The variable fraction of the emission lines originates at typical distances of only 1 to 50 light days from the central supermassive black hole.

These emission lines are fitted with composite models of broad and narrow emission, which include combinations of classical broad-line regions of fast-moving gas clouds lying outside the quasar nucleus, and/or a theoretical model of emission from an optically-thick, flattened, rotating accretion disk. All bar one of the nineteen sources are found to have emission consistent {{with the presence of}} an optically-emitting accretion disk, with the exception appearing to display complex emission including at least three broad components. Ten of the quasars have strong Bayesian evidence for broad-line emission arising from an accretion disk together with a standard broad-line region, selected in preference to a model with two simple broad lines. Thus the best explanation for the complexity required to fit the broad H-alpha lines in this sample is optical emission from an accretion disk in addition to a region of fast-moving clouds. We derive estimates of the angle between the rotation axis of the accretion disk and the line of sight. A weak correlation is found between the accretion <b>disk</b> <b>angle</b> and the logarithm of the low-frequency radio luminosity. This is direct, albeit tenuous, evidence for the receding torus model. Velocity shifts of the broad H-alpha components are analysed and the results found to be consistent with a two-component model comprising one single-peaked broad line emitted at the same redshift as the narrow lines, and emission from an accretion disk which appears to be preferentially redshifted with respect to the narrow lines for high-redshift sources and blueshifted relative to the narrow lines for low-redshift sources.

50|$|Due to {{the nose}} high {{attitude}} on the ground, propeller powered taildraggers are more {{adversely affected by}} P-factor - asymmetrical thrust caused by the propeller's <b>disk</b> being <b>angled</b> to the direction of travel, which causes the blades to produce more lift when going down than when going up due to the difference in angle the blade experiences when passing through the air. The aircraft will then pull {{to the side of}} the upward blade. Some aircraft lack sufficient rudder authority in some flight regimes (particularly at higher power settings on takeoff) and the pilot must compensate before the aircraft starts to yaw. Some aircraft, particularly older, higher powered aircraft such as the P-51 Mustang, cannot use full power on takeoff and still safely control their direction of travel. On landing this is less of a factor, however opening the throttle to abort a landing can induce severe uncontrollable yaw unless the pilot is prepared for it.|$|R
40|$|Flux-calibrated {{spectra of}} 39 low-redshift quasars from the Bright Quasar Survey (BQS) {{have been used}} to study a near-complete data set of {{optically}} selected quasars. Statistical partial rank analysis shows that the forbidden O III luminosity is more intimately connected to the H-beta luminosity, L(H-beta), than to observed continuum luminosity, L(cont). L(H-beta) is thus considered to be a better measure than L(cont) of the photoionizing luminosity. The effects of an orientation-dependent L(cont) on the rest-frame emission-line equivalent widths, EW(H-beta), and EW(forbidden O III), have been studied. It is found that scatter in the L(H-beta) - L(cont) relation is not due to a range in broad-line covering factor, and is inconsistent with one simple orientation scheme unless objects with very high <b>disk</b> inclination <b>angles</b> are excluded by the BQS selection criteria. It is demonstrated that there exists a correlation between the full width at half maximum of the H-beta line and L(H-beta), providing evidence for a gravitationally bound H-beta-emitting region and a scaling M(central) approximately proportional to L...|$|R
