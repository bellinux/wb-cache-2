5|$|While the {{individual}} diver cannot predict exactly at what depth {{the onset of}} narcosis will occur on a given day, the first symptoms of narcosis for any given diver are often more predictable and personal. For example, one diver may <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> eye focus (close accommodation for middle-aged divers), another may experience feelings of euphoria, and another feelings of claustrophobia. Some divers report that they have hearing changes, and that the sound their exhaled bubbles make becomes different. Specialist training may help divers to identify these personal onset signs, which may then {{be used as a}} signal to ascend to avoid the narcosis, although severe narcosis may interfere with the judgement necessary to take preventive action.|$|E

25|$|Fetal alcohol {{spectrum}} disorders (FASDs) are a {{group of}} conditions that can occur in a person whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy. Problems may include an abnormal appearance, short height, low body weight, small head size, poor coordination, low intelligence, behavior problems, and problems with hearing or seeing. Those affected {{are more likely to}} have trouble in school, legal problems, participate in high-risk behaviors, and <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> alcohol or other drugs. The most severe form of the condition is known as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Other types include partial fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS), alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) and alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD). Some accept only FAS as a diagnosis, seeing the evidence as inconclusive with respect to other types.|$|E
25|$|In early 1922, Parnok {{returned}} to Moscow with Erarskaya and was assisted by Vladimir Mayakovsky, who helped her find lodging {{and join the}} Writer's Union. Almost {{as soon as she}} arrived, she began experiencing trouble with the censors. Her attempts to help Maximilian Voloshin publish a collection of poems were repeatedly refused. When she tried a few months later to publish a collection of her own works, Centuries-Old Mead, the censors stopped the publication because there were too many religious references. Centuries-Old Mead was placed in stasis by the censorship bureau and never made it to press. She also feared that The Vine would <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> the censors because of its references to God. She had learned from previous experience that religious references were problematic. By fall, she was ill, suffering from both bronchitis and stomach problems caused by her Graves' disease. Erarskaya was also sick, having contracted tuberculosis.|$|E

50|$|Award-winning {{director}} Cathy Garcia-Molina {{entered the}} Big Brother House on Day 108 {{to help the}} housemates on their weekly task. With her help, they are tasked to create a short movie as their weekly task. She gave them their script and also tasked them to know their character. She came back at the Big Brother House the next day, {{only to find out}} that the housemates did not do their assignment. Instead they only memorized their script. This led to Direk Cathy's walk-out from the house. On Day 110, Big Brother called Jane and Daniel in the confession room to tell them that Direk Cathy still didn't want to come back until she sees that they are worth working for. Because of that, the housemates practiced their lines all day. The next morning, Direk Cathy came back at the Big Brother House, and the housemates apologized to her for not making their homework. After that, they started to shoot for their weekly task. All housemates <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> shooting. Daniel <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> pronouncing Tagalog words and Loisa <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> her expressions and voice. Joshua <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> acting in front of Direk Cathy and Vickie <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> her lines. On Day 111, the housemates' short film premiered in television.|$|R
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the second}} season, he was shot, which {{affected}} his control of his right-hand. His temporary fix to this possibly long-term problem was to work together with Cristina during every one of his surgeries so that she could take over in case he might <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> his hand. The arrangement fell apart after Cristina, reacting to growing stress after George O'Malley (T. R. Knight) caught onto their secret, went to the Chief and confessed everything. Initially, he was engaged in a cold war with Cristina, where neither of them spoke. However, after she broke the silence, he proposed to her and she accepted his proposal. Before their secret was revealed, Burke was to become the next Chief of Surgery, but he had to compete with his fellow attendings for the position. He has since recovered from the injury, after Derek operated on him. For the remainder of the season, Preston and Cristina prepared for the wedding and experienced normal stresses that result from such a process, such as meeting each other's parents.|$|E
25|$|Cooper's {{contribution}} was {{in response to}} claims of mediaeval origin for the scroll. Andrew Sinclair, a leading proponent of Freemasonry's descent from the Knights Templar, hailed it as a great mediaeval treasure, comparable with the Mappa Mundi in Hereford Cathedral. His claim arises from what opponents describe as an optimistic reading of radiocarbon dating, and creative interpretation of the panels. The Tabernacle is claimed to be King Solomon's Temple, with the tents removed in Sinclair's reproduction. Sinclair and his supporters also <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> lodge 128 of the Antients. It is variously claimed to be in Yorkshire, or Prince Edwin's Lodge in Bury (a Moderns Lodge constituted in 1803). In 1785, 128 was meeting in the Crown and Feathers, Holborn, London. Robert Lomas, a supporter of the early dating, now sees part of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite in one of the altar inscriptions and much of the symbolism. This would place the document to {{the second half of the}} Eighteenth century in a conventional history of the Rite, but Lomas believes it to be mid-fifteenth, again based on radiocarbon dates, which make the side panels younger than the central strip. Realistically, agreement on the scroll, its context and symbolism is a long way off.|$|E
25|$|Until the {{initiation}} ceremony and induction into {{the society and}} the receiving of the word, the horseman who were not {{members of the society}} but potential candidates would <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> horses. This would often be caused by older ploughmen who were members of the society tampering with their horses. They would put things like tacks under the horse's collar to cause it to behave irrationally. This would be unknown to the potential candidate as the techniques for training and controlling the horses were not yet given to him. Most of these techniques were based on the horse's sharp sense of smell. Foul substances placed in front of the horse or on the animal itself would cause it to refuse to move forward. This technique is known as jading and is still used by horse trainers today. There were also pleasant smelling things that were used to make a horse move forward or calm down. If the substance was an oil it could be wiped on the trainer's forehead, they would then {{stand in front of the}} animal and the smell would draw it towards them. This practice was often used in taming unruly horses. There were also pleasant smelling and inviting materials, such as sweets, that the horseman could keep in their pocket in order to calm, attract, and subdue a crazed horse. Keeping these techniques secret, along with the myth that there was a word that only the horseman knew that gave them and them alone power over horses helped guarantee their reputation, prestige, job security, and pay. The same type of logic and protection of trade secrets can be seen among modern magicians who keep their tricks secret and only share them with other members of their trade.|$|E
