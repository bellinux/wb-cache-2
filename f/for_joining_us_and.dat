"You are welcome, sir," [...] said Sir Henry Lee, whose {{feelings}} of hospitality, {{and of the}} fraternal reception due to a royalist sufferer, induced him to tolerate this intrusion more than {{he might have done}} otherwise. [...] "If you have fought or suffered for the King, sir, it is an excuse <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> commanding our services in any thing in our power--although at present we are a family-party.--But I think I saw you in waiting upon Master Markham Everard, who calls himself Colonel Everard.--If your message is from him, you may wish to see me in private?" ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{formed the}} center of an excited group in a few more minutes, <b>for</b> Niven had <b>joined</b> <b>us,</b> <b>and,</b> when he had {{answered}} some of the many questions, he asked one in turn. [...] "It was my man Wilkins warned you?" ...|$|R

60|$|As {{the words}} passed his lips the clerk <b>joined</b> <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> {{at the same}} moment there was another and a last grating turn of the key in the lock.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} me like a very long time before the {{sergeant}} <b>joined</b> <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> then I knew that the unfortunate men were out of their misery at last.|$|R

60|$|On September fourteenth Edd and George {{drifted into}} Flagstaff to <b>join</b> <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> their report of game {{and water and}} grass and acorns was so {{favorable}} that I would have gone if I {{had been unable to}} ride on anything but a wagon.|$|R

60|$|Joseph <b>and</b> Napoleon {{sometimes}} <b>joined</b> <b>us,</b> <b>and</b> I felt in my element {{with the}} three invalid soldier boys, for Napoleon still limped with a wound received in the war, Joseph had never recovered from his two years' imprisonment in an Austrian dungeon, and Laddie's loyalty might yet cost him his life.|$|R

60|$|By now Bastin had <b>joined</b> <b>us,</b> <b>and,</b> {{attracted}} by my exclamation {{and by the}} attitude of Bickley, who was {{staring down at the}} coffin with a fixed look upon his face, not unlike that of a pointer when he scents game, he began to contemplate the wonder within it in his slow way.|$|R
60|$|Then I gave {{up looking}} and thinking, since {{now or never}} was the time for action.
