5000|$|Blackburne {{motorcycles}} {{performed well}} in the 1913 and 1914 ACU six days trials. Three 499cc Blackburne motorcycles were entered in the ACU six days trial in 1914 one ridden by John Spear Roberts (ex Motosacoche Ltd http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~pattle/nacc/arc0502.htm), who is named as <b>joint</b> <b>applicant</b> in a Blackburne patent of 1918. In the judges summary of the event they stated that the [...] "Blackburne machines are also worthy of very favourable notice on account of their good engine design". With {{the outbreak of the}} war in mid-1914, three directors of Burney and Blackburne Ltd volunteered as despatch riders, these were Cecil Burney, Alec Burney and C.Q. Roberts (also Q.A.Roberts his brother). Reporting back to the Motor Cycle later that year, Alec Burney had lost his machine when it was run over by the heavy artillery during the night. Reporting in November Cecil Burney stated that his Armstrong (hub gears) were standing up wonderfully well, but was adamant that a hand clutch (instead of the common foot clutch) was an absolute requirement. In November 1916 it was reported that the Burney brothers had received lieutenants commissions, Alec running a motor cycle repair base in France, and Cecil running a repair shop for engine-driven electrical lighting units for a signals station.|$|E
40|$|This report {{provides}} {{information for the}} analysis of family structure in Australia. This electronic product presents at the national and state level, registered divorces by age, duration of marriage at final separation and at date of dissolution, country of birth and number of children. Almost 48, 000 divorces were granted in Australia during 2007, according to new figures released today by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). The number of divorces granted fell by 6 % from 2006, making it the largest year on year decrease in 20 years. There has been a growing trend over the past 20 years towards <b>joint</b> <b>applicant</b> divorces, where both partners put their names to the application. This trend continued in 2007, with one-third (33 %) of divorces granted involving joint applicants. A further 38 % were applied for by a female partner, and 27 % by a male partner.

Pranav resumes his search and finds a house, which is above his budget, but decides to buy it nonetheless. Pranav and Kajal decide to get married so they can avail higher loan as the <b>joint</b> <b>applicants.</b> Pranav manages rest of the amount from friends and his boss, but the bank refuses to approve the loan {{at the last moment}} because he works for a proprietary firm. Pranav delivers an impassioned speech and walks out of the bank. In the fortunate turn of events, because of a client work he had done, his firm secures an international client and now it's a private limited firm and Pranav is eligible for the loan again.|$|R
30|$|Similarly, this {{research}} was intended to analyze {{the difference between the}} status and the level of knowledge-based urbanization between cities through the use of patent application data. The data used for this analysis was from patent applications submitted to the Korean Intellectual Property Office from 1 January 1981 to 31 December 2010, in four Korean cities (Daegu, Kwangju, Cheonan, and Gumi). To compare and analyze the level of knowledge-based urbanization, we first compared and analyzed changes over time in the total number of patent applications. Second, we performed a time sequential comparison and an analysis of Intensity of Open Innovation (IOI), which indicated the open innovation status {{based on the number of}} <b>joint</b> <b>applicants</b> of each patent. Third, we performed a time-sequential comparative analysis of Ratio of Open Innovation (ROI), which provided the ratio of patents jointly applied by two or more people, against all patents. In addition, the patent applicants of each city were divided into two groups. Subsequently, the time sequential difference between cities was analyzed in terms of the total amount of patents, ROI, and IOI (Yun, et al., 2014).|$|R

40|$|In recent years, USF has {{accepted}} a steadily increasing proportion of freshman applicants, yet has enrolled a steadily decreasing proportion of these students. The current paper attempts {{to explain the}} reasons why this trend has occurred and what options exist for changing it. Over {{the past several years}} two effects have substantially increased the competition among higher education institutions for high school graduates: 1. the absolute number of high school graduates nationally has dropped steadily from 2, 773, 000 in 1988 / 89 to 2, 480, 000 in 1993 / 94, and 2. during this period the US. has been in an economic recession, yet tuition costs at public institutions have increased materially. The first effect reduced the pool of applicants from which institutions could fill their freshman ranks. The second effect reduced the pool even more for 4 -year institutions, as greater proportions of high school graduates were forced to attend less-costly community colleges. These effects occurred {{at the same time that}} many institutions of higher education were attempting to increase enrollments. As a result of these two factors, colleges and universities have engaged in increasingly heated competition for a steadily smaller pool of applicants. In earlier years, a consistent percentage of FTIC applicants enrolled at USF. However, the two factors noted above began to influence USF in 1990, when the yield rate of accepted applicants (proportion who enroll) began to drop and then continued to drop steadily from 47 % in 1989 to 38 % in the Fall of 1994. This drop occurred primarily because our four major SUS competitors for freshmen (UF, FSU, UCF and FAU), all lowered their admission standards relative to USF's. Over a five year period (1989 - 93), their average acceptance rate of <b>joint</b> (dual) <b>applicants</b> with USF increased 76. 2 % while USF’s acceptance rate of those same students increased only 6. 9 %. Because more than half of USF's freshmen applicants (52. 4 % in 1994) also apply to one of those four SUS institutions, it becomes clear that our yield rate has been reduced recently by our competitors lowered admission standards...|$|R
