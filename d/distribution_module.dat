50|$|Spidernaut is an {{arachnid}} inspired Extra Vehicular Robot (EVR) that {{is being}} designed by a NASA for construction, maintenance, and repair projects in future space missions {{that would be too}} difficult or too dangerous for a human. The Spidernaut’s legs can move at three different points, one rotary joint in the hip and two more joints that are linear actuated. Each leg weighs 40 pounds but is capable of supporting 100 pounds and exerting upwards of 250 pounds of force. With the robots final weight of nearly 600 pounds evenly spread out across its eight legs Spidernaut will be able to climb across many surfaces including solar panels and the exterior of space craft without causing any damage. The feet of the robot are modular, meaning they can be removed and replaced for different situations that the robot may be placed in. The avionics and other electrical systems of the Spidernaut are located in what would be its thorax and are made up of brushless DC motor controllers and power and data distributors along with the power source. The robot is powered by a 72V/3600 Watt-hour lithium ion battery, which feeds a Power Conditioning and <b>Distribution</b> <b>Module</b> which down converts the 72V main bus to all the needed voltages for all the different devices on board. NASA has also begun experimenting with a “web” like cable deployment system that would allow the robot to climb and hang above structures that cannot support even light forces.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the shell egg {{processing}} and <b>distribution</b> <b>module</b> is to simulate the processing, storage, and distribution of shell eggs from the farm to egg products processing/distribution, or preparation and consumption. Eggs remain intact throughout this process. Therefore, the primary factors affecting SE are the cumulative effects of temperatures and times of the various processing, transportation, and storage stages. The two important modeling components in this module are the time until the yolk membrane loses its integrity, and {{the growth rate of}} SE in eggs. These components are dependent on the distributions for time and temperature for various stages. The assumption is made that there is no die-off of SE once it has been deposited inside the egg. The shell egg processing and <b>distribution</b> <b>module</b> is the next stage, following egg production, in a farm-to-table quantitative risk assessment. While the egg production module simulates the number of SE-positive eggs produced by a population of commercial flocks, this processing and <b>distribution</b> <b>module</b> calculates the likelihood of various numbers of SE bacteria for a single SEpositive egg.

40|$|We first {{summarize}} {{the basic structure}} of the outer <b>distribution</b> <b>module</b> of a completely regular code. Then, employing a simple lemma concerning eigenvectors in association schemes, we propose to study the tightest case, where the indices of the eigenspace that appear in the outer <b>distribution</b> <b>module</b> are equally spaced. In addition to the arithmetic codes of the companion paper, this highly structured class includes other beautiful examples and we propose the classification of $Q$-polynomial completely regular codes in the Hamming graphs. A key result is Theorem 3. 10 which finds that the $Q$-polynomial condition is equivalent to the presence of a certain Leonard pair. This connection has impact in two directions. First, the Leonard pairs are classified and we gain quite a bit of information about the algebraic structure of any code in our class. But also this gives a new setting for the study of Leonard pairs, one closely related to the classical one where a Leonard pair arises from each thin/dual-thin irreducible module of a Terwilliger algebra of some $P$- and $Q$-polynomial association scheme, yet not previously studied. It is particularly interesting that the Leonard pair associated to some code $C$ may belong to one family in the Askey scheme while the distance-regular graph in which the code is found may belong to another.

50|$|There are two {{different}} <b>distribution</b> <b>modules</b> available going {{by the name of}} Ziris Transfer and Edge. The main difference in architecture between the two is the way the content is distributed to the players. Within Ziris Transfer, a server is embedded operating according to the FTP structure, thereby caching files and pushing them out to the players on the network. When using Ziris Edge, the opposite is achieved by using pull technology instead. By making the player contacting the main server at intervals it is possible to broadcast Digital Signage contents to hard to reach places, through intermittent networks or mobile locations. This enables the usage of Digital Signage in public transport or other mobile locations.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A general {{expansion}} {{architecture is}} proposed {{that can be}} used in building large-scale switches using any type of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) switch. The proposed universal multistage interconnection network (UniMIN) switch is composed of a buffered distribution network (DN) and a column of output switch modules (OSM’s), which can be any type of ATM switch. ATM cells are routed to their destination using a two-level routing strategy. The DN provides each incoming cell with a self-routing path to the destined OSM, which is the switch module containing the destination output port. Further routing to the destined output port is performed by the destination OSM. Use of the channel grouping technique yields excellent delay/throughput performance in the DN, and the virtual FIFO concept is used for implementing the output buffers of the <b>distribution</b> <b>module</b> without internal speedup. We also propose a “fair virtual FIFO ” to provide fairness between input links while preserving cell sequence. The distribution network is composed of one kind of <b>distribution</b> <b>module</b> which has the same size as the OSM, regardless of the overall switch size. This gives good modular scalability in the UniMIN switch. Performance analysis for uniform traffic and hot-spot traffic shows that a negligible delay and cell loss ratio in the DN can be achieved with a small buffer size, and that DN yields robust performance even with hot-spot traffic. In addition, a fairness property of the proposed fair virtual FIFO is shown by a simulation study.
