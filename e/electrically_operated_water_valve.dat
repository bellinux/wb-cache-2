5000|$|Owned {{since the}} Second World War {{by the local}} council, Marks's design was so good that, beyond {{maintenance}} and refurbishment, little has changed since 1884. In 1924, the current AC <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> <b>water</b> pump was installed replacing the 1913 DC generator & pump that itself replaced the original town gas four-cylinder Crossley combustion engine driven pump, and in 1998 the main braking wheel was replaced for the first time, together with the installation of a new hydraulic braking system to complement the original band braking/driving system. [...] In the spring of 2014, a full refurbishment of the top station was carried out returning it to its original design.|$|R
50|$|An <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> <b>water</b> pump is {{the prime}} {{motivator}} in recirculating {{the water from the}} pool. Water is forced through a filter and then returned to the pool. Using a water pump by itself is often not sufficient to completely sanitize a pool. Commercial and public pool pumps usually run 24 hours a day for the entire operating season of the pool. Residential pool pumps are typical run for 4 hours per day in winter (when the pool is not in use) and up to 24 hours in summer. To save electricity costs, most pools run water pumps for between 6 hours and 12 hours in summer with the pump being controlled by an electronic timer.|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} an <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> <b>water</b> pump in a cooling circuit is implemented, {{simulated}} and op-timized. The presented simulation results are accom-plished with Dymola. This simulation tool {{is based on}} the modeling language Modelica. The model of the water pump is realized with time domain differential equations. The parameters of the differential equations of the water pump are defined by geometrical data. The water pump is driven by an electric machine. A generator model and a battery model are used as power sources for the electric ma-chine driving the water pump. In the proposed appli-cation the thermal behaviour of all components of the cooling circuit (internal combustion engine, pipeline, cooler [...] .) is implemented. The measured and the simulated characteristics of the water pump are be compared. The efficiency improvement of the internal combustion engine when using an <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> waper pump in stead of a mechanically operated pump is presented...|$|R
5000|$|In 1905, it was purchased, {{along with}} the 3,000-acre Balcombe Estate by Weetman Pearson, 1st Viscount Cowdray for his {{daughter}} Gertrude upon her marriage to the 3rd Baron Denman. The couple went in Australia in 1911, but returned three years later due to Lord Denman's hay fever. [...] "It was not an unusual {{thing for him to}} retire" [...] to the cool of cellars of the house, where [...] "he would spend hours there reading". Lady Denman enjoyed golf and laid a course where the ninth hole was right up against the plate glass windows of the dining room so that her guests were never brave enough to hit the ball properly. In 1913, an <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> <b>water</b> pump (300 gallons per minute) was installed.|$|R
40|$|A {{fuel cell}} power system {{for use in}} a weightless environment, such as in space, {{includes}} a device for removing water from a water-hydrogen mixture condensed from the exhaust from the fuel cell power section of the system. Water is removed from the mixture in a centrifugal separator, and is fed into a holding, pressure <b>operated</b> <b>water</b> discharge <b>valve</b> via a Pitot tube. Entrained nondissolved hydrogen is removed from the Pitot tube by a bleed orifice in the Pitot tube before the water reaches the <b>water</b> discharge <b>valve.</b> <b>Water</b> discharged from the valve thus has a substantially reduced hydrogen content...|$|R

Numerous other AHRI and ASHRAE component test standards were also identified as perhaps being of help in developing a comprehensive test procedure...|$|R
50|$|The Ryde Pumping Station is a {{significant}} piece of infrastructure located in West Ryde. The Sydney Water Board {{had taken over the}} water supply for Sydney from the City Council in 1888. Almost immediately, a temporary pumping station was established at North Sydney. It was dismantled in 1892 when supply became available from a new station built in West Ryde that same year. By 1908 the station had switched to steam turbines, a first for the Board and possibly for Australia. The present Ryde Pumping Station was built on adjacent land and opened in September 1921. The old station ceased operating in 1930, its remaining plant was auctioned and the pump house was used as a store. The building was demolished in 1961. The Ryde Pumping Station, now fully <b>electrically</b> <b>operated,</b> supplies <b>water</b> to many Northern Sydney suburbs. It is the largest water pumping station in Australia.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This {{omni-directional}} wheelchair {{was designed}} for the less abled elderly to move more flexibly in narrow spaces, such as elevators or small aisle. We have constructed one dexterous three-wheeled wheelchair with smooth omni-directional motion. It does not only keep the merit of the existing manual and electrical operated wheelchair, but also with a novel omni-directional mobility system. Elderly people can easily operate such device in most environments. We implemented the dexterous and complicated mechanisms to allow such an <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> wheelchair to move forward at any direction that is far easier manoeuvred than any traditional electronic wheelchairs. We carried on improvements for design, mechanical and control system of this <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> wheelchair, {{and the development of}} smart automatic charge system and lastly a collision-evading system.
