25|$|In 2010, {{a fierce}} debate {{occurred}} about {{the rate of}} profit between leading Marxist economists from various political organizations in Western Europe and North America. According to the French Marxist economist Michel Husson, there were basically four bones of contention: (1) how had the average rate of profit in industries evolved since the early 1980s, in the larger developed capitalist countries? (2) what is the theoretical status of the tendential fall {{in the rate of}} profit in the Marxist analysis? (3) {{what is the nature of}} the capitalist crisis today? (4) what is the political relevance of this discussion? However, there was very little agreement about concepts, measurement principles, and political perspectives among participants. According to some (like Michel Husson) the rate of profit had gone up again since 1980, while others (like Andrew Kliman) thought it had stayed down. All <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> political conclusions were being drawn from the econometric evidence. The traditional orthodox Marxist narrative is that capitalist crises are crises of profitability: the economic disturbance is caused by the circumstance that capitalists are making insufficient profits, and not because there are insufficient goods for everybody. That situation is bound to happen, because of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall. Once workers understand that, they can break with illusions about reforming capitalism, and prepare for revolution. Critics point out, however, that this kind of interpretation is problematic. There are two main reasons.|$|E

2500|$|These five ideas {{turn out}} to be {{discrete}} variables, but the profit rate will go up or down, depending on the choice of measure. Andrew Kliman states in his book The failure of capitalist production that [...] "I believe that there are many different legitimate ways of measuring rates of profit, and that none serves as an all-purpose measure. The most relevant rate of profit to consider always depends upon the particular question being addressed." [...] This pluralist approach provides plenty possibilities for all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> interpretations of all kinds of profit rates, depending on what the question is thought to be, to which a profit rate {{is supposed to be the}} answer.|$|E

Donelly also noted the desire to become more diverse musically with the second album, as the band had begun to listen to more sources of music.|$|E

2500|$|The {{last step}} is that {{effectively}} capitalist market society develops {{human beings in}} an inverted way. The capitalist economy is not primarily organized for the people, but people are organized for the capitalist economy, to serve others who already have plenty of wealth. In an increasingly complex division of labour offering little job security, there {{is more and more}} external pressure forcing people to act in all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>different</b> roles, masking themselves in the process; by this act, they also acquire more and more behavioural and semiotic flexibility, and develop more and more relational skills and connections. The necessity to work and relate in order to survive thus accomplishes the [...] "economic formation of society" [...] at the same time, even if in this society people lack much control over the social relations in which they must participate. It is just that the whole development occurs in an imbalanced, unequal and uncoordinated way, in which the development of some becomes conditional on the lack of development by others.|$|E
