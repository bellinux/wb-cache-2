40|$|The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is {{the single}} global {{repository}} for three-dimensional struc-tures of biological macromolecules and their complexes, and its more than 100 000 struc-tures contain more than 20000 distinct ligands or small molecules bound to proteins and nucleic acids. Information about these small molecules and their interactions with pro-teins and nucleic acids is crucial for our understanding of biochemical processes and vital for structure-based drug design. Small molecules present in a deposited structure may be attached to a polymer or may occur as a separate, non-covalently linked ligand. During curation of a newly deposited structure by wwPDB annotation staff, each mol-ecule is cross-referenced to the PDB Chemical Component Dictionary (CCD). If the mol-ecule is new to the PDB, a dictionary description is created for it. The information about all small molecule components found in the PDB is distributed via the ftp archive as an <b>external</b> <b>reference</b> <b>file.</b> Small molecule annotation in the PDB also includes information about ligand-binding sites and about covalent and other linkages between ligands and macromolecules. During the remediation of the peptide-like antibiotics and inhibitor...|$|R

The statement itself does not process any data, specify the format or shape of a data set, or directly produce output of any type; yet, this simple statement is an invaluable construct that allows SAS programs {{to interact with the}} world outside of SAS. Through specification of the appropriate device type, the FILENAME statement allows you to symbolically <b>reference</b> <b>external</b> disk <b>files,</b> interact with FTP servers, send e-mail messages, and integrate data from external programs and processes—including the local operating system and remote web services.

40|$|The {{development}} {{of information technology}} and its application to design disciplines has changed how buildings are described and even how they are built. Engineers, architects, contractors, and other parties often exchange files instead of paper drawings, and manufacturers can be sent numeric data to guide the fabrication of customized building components. The tools of the trade, even the things possible in the trade, are changing. This brings {{up the issue of}} how best to utilize this emerging technology. Should we mold this technology to fit the tasks and concepts we have in mind, or should we learn new ways of thinking about architecture and our role as architects? Do we need to get used to thinking in terms of RGB values, <b>external</b> <b>file</b> <b>references,</b> geometric transformations, and paper space vs. model space? In short, should designers learn to think differently in order to better utilize digital design tools?...|$|R

40|$|This paper models {{different}} <b>external</b> <b>reference</b> pricing schemes - a {{price cap}} {{based on the}} drug price {{in one or two}} countries and on the minimum or average drug price - in a three-country framework. It studies the choice of <b>external</b> <b>reference</b> pricing schemes in one country as well as its effect on welfare in the other countries, the manufacturer 4 s export decision, and the incentives for the other countries to also adopt an <b>external</b> <b>reference</b> pricing scheme. Depending on market size in the country adopting <b>external</b> <b>reference</b> pricing and market size difference of the other two countries, welfare is highest under the minimum price-rule or under the average price-rule. <b>External</b> <b>reference</b> pricing increases the drug price and decreases welfare in the other countries. If the market size in the country adopting an <b>external</b> <b>reference</b> pricing scheme is sufficiently large, the manufacturer does not export to the other countries.

The new files represent {{a significant increase in}} the signal-to-noise ratio of these <b>reference</b> <b>files</b> over the old versions. The <b>reference</b> <b>files</b> also show that the dark current signal in the early reads of a MULTIACCUM observation can decrease with time in certain cases. This behavior is dependent upon the timing pattern used to read out the detector, highlighting the importance of read-by-read dark current subtraction.

40|$|Reference prices, {{which are}} {{extensively}} used in retail advertisements, have received considerable research attention {{over the last}} 25 years. The present research looks at {{the extent to which}} an advertised, or <b>external,</b> <b>reference</b> price included in a price promotion affects consumers' price beliefs. According to Helson's Adaptation-Level theory, consumers form an internal reference price, which they use as a basis for evaluating market prices. The process by which internal reference price can change according to an <b>external</b> <b>reference</b> price is, then, explained by a conjoint Adaptation-Level and Assimilation-Contrast theories. It is suggested that consumers may assimilate or contrast an <b>external</b> <b>reference</b> price and that only an assimilated price has the ability to affect the internal reference price. A first experiment was conducted to examine the extent to which consumers assimilate an <b>external</b> <b>reference</b> price. Findings from the present research suggested that, contrary to the predictions of the Assimilation-Contrast theory, the impact of an <b>external</b> <b>reference</b> price on consumers' internal price standards was monotonic. It was further suggested that this assimilation might be moderated by individual differences. A second experiment was conducted to examine the differential effects of two types of semantic cues. However, in the research, no differences were found between absolute and relative savings presentation formats. Findings as well as several issues about the measurement of internal reference price, the effects of an exaggerated <b>external</b> <b>reference</b> price and the effects of price familiarity are discussed...|$|R
