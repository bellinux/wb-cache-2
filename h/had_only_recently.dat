5|$|Christianity <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> {{arrived in}} some of these kingdoms. Some had been {{converted}} by the Gregorian mission, a group of Roman missionaries who arrived in Kent in 597 and who mainly influenced southern Britain. Others had been converted by the Hiberno-Scottish mission, chiefly Irish missionaries working in Northumbria and neighbouring kingdoms. A few kingdoms, such as Dál Riata, became Christian but how they did so is unknown. The native Picts, according to the medieval writer Bede, were converted in two stages, initially by native Britons under Ninian, and subsequently by Irish missionaries.|$|E

They held a wedding ceremony on September 18, 2004, but were not legally married until three weeks later on October 6 due to a delay finalizing the couple's prenuptial agreement. In October 2004, the singer announced she would be taking another career break to start a family.|$|E
5|$|Mufarrij {{also tried}} to win support among the Christians, and {{possibly}} curry the favour of the Byzantine Empire as well, by sponsoring works to restore the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, which <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> been demolished on the orders of al-Hakim, and by arranging the re-appointment of a Patriarch to the vacant see. In general, the Jarrahids {{seem to have had}} close relations with the Christians and maintained contact with Byzantium, a fact which would play a role in later events.|$|E
5|$|That the {{metallurgy}} {{of plutonium}} was completely unknown {{came as no}} surprise at all, for it <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> been discovered. On August 1942, Seaborg's team chemically isolated the first weighable amount of plutonium from uranium irradiated in the Jones Laboratory. Until reactors became available, minuscule amounts of plutonium were produced in the cyclotron at Washington University in St. Louis. The chemistry division worked with DuPont to develop the bismuth phosphate process used to separate plutonium from uranium.|$|E

The scientists at the Berkeley conference envisioned breeding plutonium in nuclear reactors from uranium-238 atoms that absorbed neutrons from fissioning uranium-235 atoms. At this point no reactor had been built, and only microscopic quantities of plutonium were available that had been produced by cyclotrons.|$|E
5|$|Historian Timothy Bolton has {{recently}} {{argued that the}} similarities between these genealogies is evidence of a shared family tradition between the descendants of Siward and Thorgil Sprakling. Bolton hypothesized that Siward's alleged father Bjorn was probably a historical figure, a brother of Thorgil Sprakling. Siward would then have been first cousin to Earl Ulf, the earl of Denmark who married Cnut's sister Estrith and founded the dynasty of Danish monarchs that eventually succeeded Cnut's. Bolton argued that the Sprakling family <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> risen to prominence in Scandinavia, and so Siward's career in England was another indication of that family's success in Scandinavian politics.|$|E
5|$|In 1185 John {{made his}} first visit to Ireland, {{accompanied}} by 300 knights and a team of administrators. Henry had tried to have John officially proclaimed King of Ireland, but Pope Lucius III would not agree. John's first period of rule in Ireland was not a success. Ireland <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> been conquered by Anglo-Norman forces, and tensions were still rife between Henry II, the new settlers and the existing inhabitants. John infamously offended the local Irish rulers by making fun of their unfashionable long beards, failed to make allies amongst the Anglo-Norman settlers, began to lose ground militarily against the Irish and finally returned to England later in the year, blaming the viceroy, Hugh de Lacy, for the fiasco.|$|E

A few minutes later, the 9th Fighter Squadron—which <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> converted to the P-38—downed another Japanese fighter, while P-40s of the 41st Fighter Squadron surprised six Japanese fighters, shooting down three. The airmen claimed to have shot down 23 Japanese fighters and a bomber. Australian gunners of the 156th Light Anti Aircraft Battery claimed another bomber and two fighters. For its part in the battle, the 374th Troop Carrier Group was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, John {{undertook}} {{an expedition}} to Ireland in 1185, which was not a success. Ireland <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> been conquered by Anglo-Norman forces, and tensions were still rife between Henry's representatives, the new settlers and the existing inhabitants. John offended the local Irish rulers, failed to make allies amongst the Anglo-Norman settlers, began to lose ground militarily against the Irish, and finally returned to England within the year. In 1186 Henry was about to return John to Ireland once again, when news came that Geoffrey {{had died in a}} tournament at Paris, leaving two young children; this event once again changed the balance of power between Henry and his remaining sons.|$|E
5|$|Michigan {{opened the}} 2010 season {{at home against}} the Connecticut Huskies, the first ever meeting between the two schools. Michigan celebrated the re-dedication of Michigan Stadium with a special flyover by a World War II era B-25 bomber from the nearby Yankee Air Museum in Ypsilanti Township, and then another flyover {{immediately}} following the national anthem by two A-10 aircraft. Brock Mealer—the brother of Michigan guard Elliot Mealer—led the team onto the field by walking to the banner and touching it, which sparked a standing ovation from the crowd.

5|$|No. 77 Wing {{formed the}} attack {{component}} of No.10 Operational Group (No.10 OG), {{which was established}} on 13November 1943. The group was {{to act as a}} mobile strike force capable of supporting Allied ground and naval units while they advanced against the Japanese in the South West Pacific Area (SWPA), as distinct from the RAAF's area commands in Northern Australia, which had a geographically based static defence function. Led by Wing Commander E.G. Fyfe, No.77 Wing consisted of three flying squadrons operating Vultee Vengeance dive bombers, and various ancillary units. The Vengeances, which <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> been acquired by Australia, equipped Nos. 21, 23 and 24 Squadrons. They were to be protected on their attack missions by No.10 OG's fighter component, No.78 Wing, operating Curtiss Kittyhawks.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese {{encouraged}} intermarriage {{with the}} local population, and strongly supported the Roman Catholic Church. In 1560, they started proselytising the local Koli, Kunbi, Kumbhar population in Mahim, Worli, and Bassein. These Christians were referred to by the British as Portuguese Christians, though they were Nestorian Christians who <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> established ties with the Roman Catholic Church. During this time, Bombay's main trade was coconuts and coir. After Antonio Pessoa's death in 1571, a patent was issued which granted Mazagaon in perpetuity to the Sousa e Lima family. The St. Andrew Church at Bandra was built in 1575.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Paine's {{pamphlet}} Common Sense {{was published}} in January 1776, just as it became clear in the colonies that the king was not inclined {{to act as a}} conciliator. Paine <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> arrived in the colonies from England, and he argued in favor of colonial independence, advocating republicanism as an alternative to monarchy and hereditary rule. Common Sense introduced no new ideas and probably had little direct effect on Congress's thinking about independence; its importance was in stimulating public debate on a topic that few had previously dared to openly discuss. Public support for separation from Great Britain steadily increased after the publication of Paine's enormously popular pamphlet.|$|E

5|$|A {{short period}} of home leave followed, before the battalion's {{personnel}} concentrated at Royal Park for a march through Melbourne. A draft of reinforcements arrived around this time also, incorporating men from New South Wales and several others states. In mid-September, the battalion moved to Greta, New South Wales, travelling by rail through Shepparton, Tocumwal and Newcastle. A brief period of training was undertaken there, during which the battalion's khaki uniforms were dyed green. During this time, the battalion was re-organised and converted to the jungle establishment; {{as part of this}} process its authorised strength was reduced to around 800 personnel of all ranks. The situation in the Pacific had deteriorated dramatically, and the Australian forces holding out against the Japanese in New Guinea were hard-pressed and desperately in need of reinforcement. Thus in early October 1942, not more than two months after returning to Australia, the 2/5th moved to Brisbane, Queensland, where it deployed to Milne Bay, which <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> been held {{in the face of a}} Japanese landing, aboard the Dutch transport Maetsuyker.|$|E
5|$|On {{the west}} side of the Naktong, North Korean Major General Pak Kyo Sam, {{commanding}} the NK 9th Division, issued his operations order to the division on August 28. Its mission in the forthcoming attack was to outflank and destroy the US troops at Naktong Bulge by capturing the Miryang and Samnangjin areas to cut off the US 2nd Division's route of supply and withdrawal between Taegu and Pusan. However, the North Koreans were not aware that the US 2nd Infantry Division had recently replaced the US 24th Infantry Division in positions along the Naktong River. Consequently, they expected lighter resistance; the 24th troops were exhausted from months of fighting but the 2nd Division men were fresh and newly arrived in Korea. They <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> been moved into the line. The North Koreans began crossing the Naktong River under cover of darkness at certain points.|$|E
5|$|Once in Britain the {{division}} {{was attached to}} U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps, under Major General Matthew Ridgway, which commanded all American airborne formations, and which in turn {{became part of the}} First Allied Airborne Army when it was formed on 21 August, under the command of Lieutenant General Lewis H. Brereton. Although attached to XVIII Airborne Corps, {{the division}} was not chosen to participate in Operation Market Garden, a large-scale airborne operation intended to seize several bridges through the Netherlands to allow the Allied armies to bypass the Rhine river and enter Germany. The 17th was passed over in favour of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions because it <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>recently</b> arrived in the European Theater and was considered to be unprepared logistically as it was still collecting its combat equipment. The division, now with Colonel Edson Raff's 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment under commanda veteran unit which had fought in Normandy under command of the 82nd Airborne Divisionremained in England as a theater reserve during Market Garden and its aftermath, as the Allied armies continued their advance towards Germany.|$|E
