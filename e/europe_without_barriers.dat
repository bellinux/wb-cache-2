40|$|It was the {{intention}} of the Treaty of Rome to create a common market in <b>Europe,</b> <b>without</b> <b>barriers</b> for the free circulation of goods. 40 years later, there is a common market with virtually no restrictions on the movement of people, goods, capital and services, there are good prospects for the common currency, but there is still not a common, unitary patent system in the European Union. "One market, one currency, one patent!" remains for the moment wishful thinking [[1]]. This is a key issue in the European patent arena. Legislative options for a reform of the system and implementation of the Community Patent Convention are discussed, {{in the light of the}} continuing problems of litigation and its attendant complexities and cost, of the national political dimension and of languages. ...|$|E

It {{is assumed that}} the discursive practices of students <b>without</b> <b>barriers</b> will affect their perception negatively on inclusive education. This leads to the students without barriers' attitude. As a result the students <b>without</b> <b>barriers</b> believed that upbringing {{played a role in}} their discourses. Parental and societal stereotypes blinded them to discourses. Analysing the discourses of students <b>without</b> <b>barriers</b> indicates the need for support in order to go beyond their stereotypes. To confirm these findings, I used qualitative study to conduct my research. The literature is reviewed in Chapter Two to find out what various researchers in previous studies say with regard to the discourses of students <b>without</b> <b>barriers.</b> Six respondents were selected from two different universities, namely the Central University of Technology and the University of the Free State. This was done with the purpose of analysing the discourse of students <b>without</b> <b>barriers</b> to determine if they understood {{what it means to be}} supported. The Free Attitude Interview was used as the technique for gathering information from the respondents. The purpose was to find the discourses of students <b>without</b> <b>barriers</b> in an inclusive higher education. This research study used the textually orientated discourse analysis (TODA) as a technique for gathering data. A tape recorder was used as a supplement for information that might be forgotten. The audio recordings were transcribed, verbatim and later interpreted. The spoken word of the respondents was analysed with the aim of disclosing the ideology carried by the respondents. This study is able to conclude that students <b>without</b> <b>barriers</b> felt superior to physically disabled students, as they indicated in their dominant discourses. This implies that students <b>without</b> <b>barriers</b> are positioned with ideology and discourses in so far as their meaning construction of discourses are concerned. Based on the findings, the study recommends an inservice programme to help students <b>without</b> <b>barriers</b> to become aware of their discursive practices. The students <b>without</b> <b>barriers</b> should not allow negative stereotypes and misconception to prevent them from their discourses in inclusive higher education...|$|R

40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} focused on {{teaching}} English to dyslexic children, especially on {{the application of a}} special computer programme designed for dyslexic pupils, called Languages <b>without</b> <b>Barriers.</b> The aim of the theoretical part was to give a report on who dyslexic pupils are, what textbooks and other special materials that encourage dyslexic children are available in the Czech Republic and to outline the way dyslexic pupils should be approached in English lessons. The aim of the practical part was to look briefly into the current situation of teaching English to dyslexic children in the Czech Republic and find out whether Czech teachers have enough information on how to approach such pupils. The main aim of this part was to focus on the special computer programme Languages <b>without</b> <b>Barriers.</b> This diploma thesis aimed to find the optimal application of this programme. To accomplish this task a research was carried out. The programme was introduced to three lower secondary schools in Prague, where it was applied in several English lessons and later at home to help children prepare for their English lessons. The research was based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative analyses. The research shows that Languages <b>without</b> <b>Barriers</b> is a useful programme for dyslexic pupils as well as for [...] ...|$|R

With our method, Green’s {{strain energy}} {{can also be}} used to compute {{high-quality}} parameterizations (Figure 1). <b>Without</b> <b>barriers,</b> this produces a parameterization that is very close to an isome-try, but with many flipped triangles. With our method, we obtain a parameterization that is similar to the one computed with ARAP in Figure 13 of the paper. Green’s strain energy produces a parametrization with a slightly higher average conformal distortion of 5. 38 compared to 4. 23 of ARAP with barriers and 2. 80 for ARAP <b>without</b> <b>barriers.</b> The number of iterations increases to 417 and the computation time is 75. 2 seconds. 2 Deformation Energies In this section we review the basics of deformation modeling, more details can be found in the literature [NMK∗ 06].
