Effective thermal conductivity models {{which can be used}} to analyze the heat transfer phenomena of a prismatic <b>fuel</b> <b>block</b> were evaluated by the experiments. In the accident condition of VHTR when forced convection is lost, the heat flows in radial direction through the hexagonal fuel blocks that contain the large number of coolant holes and fuel compacts. Due to the complex geometry of <b>fuel</b> <b>block</b> and radiation heat transfer, the detail computation of heat transfer on the <b>fuel</b> <b>block</b> needs excessive computation resources. Therefore, the detail computation isn't appropriate for the lumped parameter code and a system code such as GAMMA+ adopts effective thermal conductivity model. Despite the complexity in heat transfer modes, the accurate analysis on the heat transfer in <b>fuel</b> <b>block</b> is necessary since it is directly relevant to the integrity of nuclear fuel embedded in <b>fuel</b> <b>block.</b> To satisfy the accurate analysis of complex heat transfer modes with limited computing sources, the credible effective thermal conductivity (ETC) models in which the effects of all of heat transfer modes are lumped is necessary.

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy is {{exploring}} {{the potential for}} the VHTR which will be either of a prismatic or a pebble-bed type. One important design consideration for the reactor core of a prismatic VHTR is coolant bypass flow which occurs in the interstitial regions between <b>fuel</b> <b>blocks.</b> Such gaps are an inherent presence in the reactor core because of tolerances in manufacturing the blocks and the inexact nature of their installation. Furthermore, the geometry of the graphite blocks changes over the lifetime of the reactor because of thermal expansion and irradiation damage. The existence of the gaps induces a flow bias in the <b>fuel</b> <b>blocks</b> and results in unexpected increase of maximum fuel temperature. Traditionally, simplified methods such as flow network calculations employing experimental correlations are used to estimate flow and temperature distributions in the core design. However, the distribution of temperature in the fuel pins and graphite blocks as well as coolant outlet temperatures are strongly coupled with the local heat generation rate within <b>fuel</b> <b>blocks</b> which is not uniformly distributed in the core.

The reactivity-equivalent physical transformation (RPT) method of homogenizing TRISO particle fuel regions has been proven for the rods of prismatic gas reactors {{as well as the}} pebbles of pebble bed reactor cores. After application of the RPT method, each <b>fuel</b> <b>block</b> of a prismatic gas reactor contains more than 900 different regions to explicitly model. A full core simulation of a problem of this size would simply be too computationally expensive to perform regularly. In order to perform needed calculations for these reactors, simplification of the models is a must. One option is to use a simple volume-weighted homogenization (VWH), which results in a highly underestimated reactivity for the <b>fuel</b> <b>block.</b> The goal of this research is explore methods of homogenization that will correctly predict key parameters of the problem while providing a significant decrease in the computational expense. ^ The macro reactivity-equivalent transformation (MRPT) method involves geometrically homogenizing the prismatic <b>fuel</b> <b>block</b> into 7 different fuel regions while maintaining use of continuous energy cross sections in MCNP. Application of the MRPT method can decrease the steady-state computation time of a prismatic block by more than 190 times while maintaing accuracy of the multiplication factor as well as principal reaction rates.

The location of these burnable poisons near vertices results in an asymmetry in the morphology of the assemblies (or blocks). Hence the resulting inadequacy of traditional homogenization methods, as these “spread” the actually local effect of the burnable poisons throughout the assembly. Furthermore, the actual effect of the burnable poison is primarily local with influence in its immediate vicinity, which happens to include a small region within the same assembly as well as similar regions in the adjacent assemblies.

40|$|The {{prismatic}} block Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) is {{a leading}} Generation IV reactor concept. This reactor with its relatively low core power density and large graphite mass currently satisfies the fundamental goals of the Generation IV charter. However, modifications {{can be made to}} the fuel and clad design, such that (1) VHTR uranium enrichment can be lowered to near commercial-grade pressurized water reactor (PWR) enrichments, (2) fuel burnups are extended, and (3) the thermal safety margin under transient conditions is increased. This paper outlines a possible fuel and clad design concept for use in a VHTR prismatic block core which could lead to substantial improvements in overall VHTR economics and sustainability. The results of depletion calculations here will demonstrate comparable burnup between the new fuel and clad design with only 4 - 6 wt% enriched uranium and the current higher enriched 10 - 20 wt% VHTR fuel design. In addition, the new fuel and clad design concept uses high-temperature ceramic fuel and clad materials that have the potential to significantly increase the thermal margin under VHTR transient conditions. The current <b>fuel</b> <b>block</b> design for the VHTR is the hexagonal Fort Saint Vrain (FSV) <b>fuel</b> <b>block</b> with 108 coolant channels, 210 fuel rods, and six burnable poison holes drilled axially in the block.

Further optimizations of the <b>fuel</b> <b>block</b> are in progress. Currently, the proposed nuclear fuel for the prismatic VHTR is the well-known TRISO-coated particle fuel. The TRISO-coated particle offers a nice spherical, high-integrity pressure vessel containment for the fission gases (SiC layer). However, due to the multiple particle coating layers, the fuel kernel represents only 9. 4 % of the total particle volume (350 {micro}m kernel diameter particle) and together with the 35 % packing fraction limitation in the fuel compacts, uranium loading in the fuel rods is not only very inefficient but, at VHTR uranium loadings, results in a strongly under-moderated condition in the core that translates into a large reactivity and burnup penalty...|$|E

The analysis of information about application of thorium as fuel in reactor systems and its perspective use is presented in the work. The results of the first stage of neutron-physical researches of a 3 D model of the high-temperature gas-cooled thorium reactor based on the <b>fuel</b> <b>block</b> of the unified design are given. The calculation 3 D model for the program code of MCU- 5 series was developed. According to the comparison results of neutron-physical characteristics, several optimum reactor core compositions were chosen. The results of calculations of the reactivity margins, neutron flux distribution, and power density in the reactor core for the chosen core compositions are presented in the work...|$|E
40|$|A {{nuclear power}} station using gas as a cooling medium has {{attracted}} so much attention because it offers high efficiency and greater safety. For a nuclear station that operates {{at a very high}} temperature, a gas-cooled reactor is fueled by uranium, moderated by graphite, and customarily cooled by helium. Nevertheless, throughout the operation, the bypass flow might be a result of a change in graphite shape that is caused by neutron damage. Core bypass and cross flows are significant elements to consider since the cross gap set hurdles to the flow field that are capable of diverting sufficient amount of coolant from reactor core location and initiating a possible fuel overheating. However, there is a great need to sufficiently validate this method by carrying out a thorough evaluation based on working environment analysis. Comparing the computed results with the existing data from Groehn’s NHDA PMR- 200 study {{was the only way to}} validate data. A model simulation was performed on a two-prismatic <b>fuel</b> <b>block</b> with a cross gap to examine the gaping size effect. Finally, the prediction methods for horizontal flow phenomena using a CFD technique and the field investigation results from the VHTR core were verified, and the identification of the horizontal flow behavior played a vital role in investigating the coolant velocity and pressure distribution in the horizontal gap...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to determine various design and performance parameters, including wing loading and thrust loading requirements, for powered-lift and mechanical flap conceptual aircraft constrained by field length and community noise impact. Mission <b>block</b> <b>fuel</b> and direct operating costs (DOC) were found for optimum designs. As a baseline, the design and performance parameters were determined for the aircraft using engines without noise suppression. The constraint of the 90 EPNL noise contour being less than 2. 6 sq km (1. 0 sq mi) in area was then imposed. The results indicate that for both aircraft concepts the design gross weight, DOC, and required mission <b>block</b> <b>fuel</b> decreased with field length. At field lengths less than 1100 m (3600 ft) the powered lift aircraft had lower DOC and <b>block</b> <b>fuel</b> than the mechanical flap aircraft but produced higher unsuppressed noise levels. The noise goal could easily be achieved with nacelle wall treatment only and thus resulted in little or no performance or weight penalty for all studied aircraft...|$|R

A group of 20 member of The Committee of Victims of the Guarimbas demonstrated outside of the Spanish embassy in Venezuela, demanding Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, to [...] "not encourage impunity" [...] after he demanded the release of Leopoldo Lopez on 27 October.|$|R
