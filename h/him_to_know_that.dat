25|$|Eddie {{is first}} seen reading a {{newspaper}} mentioning his second cousin Alfie Moon (Shane Richie) {{and decides to}} visit as he has not seen him for 15 years and wants to see Alfie's son, Tommy, but is hit by Carol Jackson's (Lindsey Coulson) car outside The Queen Victoria public house. When he comes to, he argues with Carol and Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) asks who he is. At that point, Alfie enters and recognises Eddie. Kat does not want Eddie to stay as {{she does not want}} <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Michael is Tommy's birth father. Michael sees Eddie in the pub but leaves immediately as {{he does not want to}} speak to him. Alfie later tells Eddie that Tommy is his grandson.|$|E
2500|$|Well, {{the world}} is a haunted house, and Helnwein at times is our tour guide through it. In his work he is willing to take on the sadness, the irony, the ugliness and the beauty. But not all of Gottfried's work is on a canvas. A lot of it is the way he's {{approached}} life. And it doesn't take someone knowing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that.</b> You take one look at the paintings and you say [...] "this guy has been around." [...] You can't sit in a closet – and create this. This level of work is earned.Sean Penn ...|$|E
2500|$|Hawking {{began his}} {{university}} education at University College, Oxford in October 1959 {{at the age}} of 17. For the first 18 months, he was bored and lonelyhe [...] found the academic work [...] "ridiculously easy". His physics tutor, Robert Berman, later said, [...] "It was only necessary for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> something could be done, and he could do it without looking to see how other people did it." [...] A change occurred during his second and third year when, according to Berman, Hawking made more of an effort [...] "to be one of the boys". He developed into a popular, lively and witty college member, interested in classical music and science fiction. Part of the transformation resulted from his decision to join the college boat club, the University College Boat Club, where he coxed a rowing crew. The rowing coach at the time noted that Hawking cultivated a daredevil image, steering his crew on risky courses that led to damaged boats.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{would be}} a new {{distress}} <b>to</b> <b>him</b> even <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I earn a little money, and that Fanny earns a little money. He is so anxious about us, you see, feeling helplessly shut up there. Such a good, good father!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Delighted to hear it, dear.' When she had {{shopping}} to do, she frequently went up with him, {{so it did}} {{not surprise}} him. What would have surprised <b>him</b> was <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> she had despatched three telegrams, by means of Jemima, before he was up.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy {{understood}} <b>him.</b> Clay seemed <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> he {{was very}} ill. He lay quiet again, as if it tired <b>him</b> <b>to</b> talk.|$|R
2500|$|Lyrically, the album's theme {{speaks of}} girls' experiences. The album was widely {{addressed}} a personal album, speaking {{about what it}} is like to be [...] "a girl like me"—things that girls Rihanna's age at the time were going through—as well as every aspect of her life: people being cheated on, falling in and out of love, people hating on you, having feelings towards a guy and partying. [...] "SOS" [...] tells about a guy who gives the girl a feeling that is very overwhelming—he drives the girl crazy, and she needs someone to rescue her from it. [...] "Kisses Don't Lie" [...] talks about a girl who's in love with a guy but is stuck between an ultimatum because she's afraid of getting hurt. [...] "Unfaithful" [...] documents the decay of a relationship when another person starts cheating. According to Rihanna, [...] "I'm referred to as a murderer in that song, meaning I'm taking this guy's life by hurting him, cheating on him. He knows, and it makes him feel so bad. It's killing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> another guy is making me happy." [...] "We Ride" [...] talks about how a guy promises a girl that they will be together forever, while the girl describes moments which he did things that could tear them apart. The lyrics of [...] "Dem Haters" [...] portray a message about how [...] "haters" [...] try to bring people down and recommends excluding them from your life. [...] "Final Goodbye" [...] talks about a woman who wants to spend the rest of her life with a man but feels that she needs to reveal a secret before moving on. [...] "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" [...] continues the theme of love in a similar vein to [...] "SOS", however, [...] "Crazy Little Thing Called Love" [...] portrays a message about being in love, whereas [...] "SOS" [...] talks about having an overwhelming feeling towards a guy.|$|E
60|$|Old Dutcher's eyes twinkled. It did not displease <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> the Carleton boys hated him. In fact, {{it seemed}} as if he rather liked it.|$|E
60|$|Her {{eyes were}} lifted to his and Peter was {{conscious}} {{of the fact that}} she wished <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> they were beautiful. She looked slowly away again.|$|E
60|$|He read it eagerly. Whatever its message, {{it seemed}} a relief <b>to</b> <b>him</b> just then <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> his {{suspense}} was to be ended.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Lodbrog, His is charm {{beyond all}} thinking, beyond all describing. But <b>to</b> look upon <b>Him</b> is <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{here is the}} all-soul of {{goodness}} and of compassion. I have seen Him. I have heard Him. I shall give all I have to the poor, and I shall follow Him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, all I wanted <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> is <b>that</b> I wasn't trying <b>to</b> punish <b>him</b> {{for what}} he said about things in general. You {{naturally}} got that idea, I reckon; but I always went in for lettin' people say what they please and think what they please; it's the only way in a free country." ...|$|R
60|$|James {{was pleased}} to have seen the Larchers. It {{satisfied}} and relieved <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> human sorrow was not beyond human endurance: as the greatest of their gifts, the gods have vouchsafed to man a happy forgetfulness.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you {{can have}} your revenge and five guineas besides," [...] Flash said. [...] "But we must be there at the time. I should like <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I was at the bottom of his being caught." ...|$|E
6000|$|How Blunt had {{got enough}} {{information}} to base that atrocious calumny upon, Monsieur George couldn’t imagine. But there it was. He kept silent in his indignation till his friend murmured, “I expect you will want <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you are here.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] he replied. [...] "My askin' Bostil for you doesn't mean I've any hope. ... It's just I want <b>him</b> an' {{everybody}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I asked." ...|$|R
6000|$|No one changed countenance, but a {{sense of}} Cap'n Billy's wit sparely yet satisfyingly glimmered from the eyes of Cap'n George and the storekeeper, and Cap'n Jabez closed his knife with a snap and looked up. [...] "Perhaps," [...] he suggested, [...] "she's seen enough of <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{beforehand}} <b>that</b> there {{would be too much}} of him." ...|$|R
50|$|Alexander {{met some}} gymnosophists, who were of trouble <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> He came <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> their leader was Dandamis, {{who lived in}} a jungle, lying naked on leaves, near a water spring.|$|R
6000|$|... "The beaters are in {{the other}} part of the wood already," [...] he said. [...] "Very likely they will come this way, too. If they see us together, they will tell Mr. Rochester. I don't want <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I am here just yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hubert {{was about}} to alight again, when Mrs. Hardy said: [...] "You had better ride to meet your papa, Hubert. He will be very much alarmed {{when he sees the}} flag, {{and it will be a}} great {{satisfaction}} to <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> we at least are all safe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go at least, MacLouis, and {{let them}} know that I wait their pleasure," [...] said the Prince. [...] "If my uncle desires to have the credit of {{shutting}} the father's apartment against the son, it will gratify <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I am attending in the outer hall like a lackey." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{a little}} blue mark upon his temple," [...] he continued, {{in the same}} hard, emotionless voice. [...] "We stood and looked at it, you and I. It was close upon morning then, you know--it seemed to grow light as we stood there, didn't it? You tried <b>to</b> bring <b>him</b> <b>to.</b> I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> it was no use. I <b>knew</b> then <b>that</b> he was dead." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{said nothing}} of this resolution, but sent a note <b>to</b> Throop, {{requesting}} <b>him</b> <b>to</b> let Rawlins <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{she was ready}} to bail Hanscom. [...] "It will be a great injustice if he is held on my account." ...|$|R
60|$|William Wetherell's {{hand was}} {{trembling}} {{so that he}} could not write, and he could not trust his voice to speak. Although Jethro had never mentioned Isaac Worthington's name <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> Wetherell <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> Jethro hated the first citizen of Brampton.|$|R
6000|$|... "No. I {{should like}} <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> I have shown it to you. I should think it a liberty for an American {{to write to}} me in that way after such a short acquaintance, and I don't see why I should {{tolerate}} it from a foreigner, though I suppose their customs are different." ...|$|E
60|$|Shefford rose to {{accompany}} her. She looked at him, and her haunting {{eyes seemed to}} want <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> he had helped her to forget the present, to remember girlhood, and that somehow she would always associate a wonderful happy afternoon with him. He divined that her silence then was a Mormon seal on lips.|$|E
6000|$|At {{one o'clock}} the Squire roused John Knapp. [...] "It is one o'clock, John; now {{take off your}} boots. I don't want <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> there is anyone in the house till we get hold of him. I am going to {{lie down on the}} sofa in the parlor. The moment you hear {{footsteps}} you come and wake me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're a good fellow, Richard," [...] Hunterleys said softly. [...] "We {{may have}} to wait an hour or two, {{and it may be that}} nothing will happen, but it's giving the fellow a chance, and it gives <b>him</b> confidence, too, <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> friends are at hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{spite of}} my emotion I still held firmly to the rope, and the tiger still glared down upon me. It was too far for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> jump; he <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> if he did he would be dashed to pieces. This gave me {{strength}} and courage.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, mamma," [...] said Lily, [...] "what {{difference}} can it make <b>to</b> <b>him?</b> You <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{our presence}} near him {{was always a}} trouble <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> He never really wanted us. He liked to have Bell there when he thought that Bell would marry his pet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{is crazy}} beyond a doubt," [...] said the Alpine man. [...] "Nobody but a maniac {{could have gone}} up and down that {{mountain}} as he did! He hasn't any muscles, and one need only look at <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> he couldn't do any climbing in a natural way. It is only the excitement of insanity that gives him strength." ...|$|E
60|$|Bowser didn't look to {{see where}} he was going. He didn't care. It was enough for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Old Man Coyote had gone that way, and where Old Man Coyote could go Bowser felt sure he could follow. So, still baying {{with all his might}} and making the hills ring with the sound of his great voice, Bowser kept on.|$|E
60|$|He {{carefully}} {{placed the}} satchel {{on the table}} and sat down on a bench. Joe regarded him suspiciously, remembering the girl's warning, but said nothing more. Josie was watching Kauffman from her retreat, but as her little office was dark and the German sat under a bright light it was impossible for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> his every movement was under observation.|$|E
50|$|As Sabourin's embezzling is also uncovered, {{the court}} begins an attempt <b>to</b> deport <b>him</b> <b>to</b> Czechoslovakia. <b>Knowing</b> <b>that</b> the communists will {{confiscate}} his money there, Sabourin instructs Miss Kelly to contact his mother. The mother is initially {{happy to see}} her son, but refuses his plan to tell the court that Sabourin was born illegitimately in Switzerland and disowns him. Miss Kelly, who has long concealed her love and concern for Sabourin, implores <b>him</b> <b>to</b> return the stolen money and tells him that his way does not {{work out in the}} end.|$|R
60|$|Yes, Blacky the Crow {{was very}} much pleased with himself. It looked very much {{as if he would}} succeed in helping Bowser the Hound. This pleased him. But it pleased <b>him</b> still more <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> he was fooling clever Reddy Fox while Reddy thought {{he was the one who}} was doing the fooling.|$|R
2500|$|Since [...] "Killer Chat" [...] {{also was}} MacNicol's last Numb3rs episode, McGill had to {{juxtaposition}} the crime with MacNicol's departure. The producers wanted a farewell that was fitting for Larry {{and that would}} allow for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> return. <b>Knowing</b> <b>that</b> Larry's dream was to go into space, the producers contacted NASA about the requirements of being an astronaut. The writers decided to send Larry off aboard the space shuttle. For Larry's final scene {{toward the end of}} the episode, series executive producer Barry Schindel suggested the Right Stuff-type scene.|$|R
