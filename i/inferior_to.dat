5|$|Roger Sale {{believes}} Andersen {{expressed his}} feelings {{of social and}} sexual inferiority by creating characters that are <b>inferior</b> <b>to</b> their beloveds. The Little Mermaid, for example, has no soul while her human beloved has a soul as his birthright. In “Thumbelina”, Andersen suggests the toad, the beetle, and the mole are Thumbelina’s inferiors and should remain in their places rather than wanting their superior. Sale indicates they are not <b>inferior</b> <b>to</b> Thumbelina but simply different. He suggests that Andersen may have done some damage to the animal world when he colored his animal characters with his own feelings of inferiority.|$|E
5|$|The V or Vic {{formation}} {{was developed}} in June, which made {{a greater emphasis on}} each pilot looking for the enemy, search capability and avoiding being taken by surprise. Still, it was <b>inferior</b> <b>to</b> German fighter tactics.|$|E

Miss Aldclyffe formed one of what was called a Ladies' Association, each member of which collected tributary streams of shillings from her <b>inferiors,</b> <b>to</b> add to her own pound at the end.|$|R
5|$|The early women’s {{movement}} in China focused on eradicating {{the assumption that}} women were <b>inferior</b> <b>to</b> men. The early reformers believed that women needed help to improve their own attitudes about themselves, since even the women generally considered themselves to be <b>inferior</b> <b>to</b> men. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) had shown an early interest in protecting the rights of women. During the 2nd National Congress in 1922, the CCP issued a statement arguing {{for the end of}} Chinese traditions that repress women. The CCP also released a formal letter ensuring equality under the law for both men and women, and guaranteed equal pay for both genders during the 3rd National Congress.|$|E

5|$|Despite the accident, a {{pre-production}} {{batch of}} ten aircraft was ordered on 27 July 1945 {{as it was}} felt that mixed-power aircraft would be of some use easing the transition of pilots from piston-engine fighters to jet-engined ones. At the same time Sukhoi's Su-5 was cancelled as it was judged <b>inferior</b> <b>to</b> the I-250.|$|E

5|$|Florida State (84) {{earned a}} BCS berth despite a record <b>inferior</b> <b>to</b> {{the other seven}} BCS teams. Regardless of that fact, the Seminoles' matchup with Penn State (101) in the 2006 Orange Bowl, where college football's two winningest coaches, Penn State's 78-year-old Joe Paterno and Florida State's 76-year-old Bobby Bowden, squared off.|$|E
5|$|In late 1944 {{the prisoners}} had counterfeited {{the reverse of}} the dollar, and the obverse by January 1945. Twenty samples of the $100 note were produced—without the serial number, whose {{algorithm}} was still being examined—and shown to Himmler and banking experts. The standard of engraving and printing was considered excellent, although the paper used was technically <b>inferior</b> <b>to</b> the genuine notes.|$|E

Nothing {{is known about}} its breeding habits or its eggs, but one reported nest was a hollow in a palm.|$|E

60|$|Not another {{syllable}} did Bluewater utter {{until his}} boat had touched {{the side of}} the Cæsar. He reflected deeply on his situation, and those who know his feelings will easily understand that his reflections were not altogether free from pain. Such as they were, he kept them to himself, however, and in a man-of-war's boat, when a flag-officer chooses to be silent, {{it is a matter of}} course for his <b>inferiors</b> <b>to</b> imitate his example.|$|R
60|$|On {{the highest}} summit of their towering mast floated a small blue flag, {{the symbol of}} authority, and beneath it paced a man to and fro the deck, who was {{abandoned}} by his <b>inferiors</b> <b>to</b> his more elevated rank. His square-built form and careworn features, which had lost the brilliancy of an English complexion, and hair whitened prematurely, spoke of bodily vigor, and arduous services which had put that vigor to the severest trials.|$|R
5|$|The Admiralty's {{decision}} saddled the Royal Navy {{with a pair}} {{of ships}} that could not operate with the Warriors in a tactical squadron and were <b>inferior</b> <b>to</b> the French ironclads then under construction.

5|$|The Alekseyev I-21 was a Soviet twin-engined jet fighter, {{built in}} the late 1940s. Two prototypes were {{constructed}} with the designation of I-211, of which one was converted into the I-215 with more powerful engines.
