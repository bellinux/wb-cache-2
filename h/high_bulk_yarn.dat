40|$|A {{new method}} has been {{developed}} for applying microcapsules in the spinning process, in all yarns made on ring spinning machines, whether short fiber or long fiber. The microcapsules {{were placed in the}} interstices of the yarn, before twisting. This solves the problem of permanence of the effect provided by the active ingredients contained in the microcapsule, for functionality and use of textile garments, against repeated washing. The method is technically and industrially feasible. This has been demonstrated by the interest shown by an important manufacturer of spinning machinery. The proposed method is valid for all types of fibers that are processed by the systems of carded cotton, worsted, semi-worsted, woolen and <b>high</b> <b>bulk</b> (HB) <b>yarns</b> when obtained in ring spinning machines.

40|$|Critical disolution time {{technique}} (TCD) for acrylic fibres {{has been}} developed {{as a means of}} detecting structural fibre differences which can give rise to defects of different value in the articles manufactured from them. Dimethylformamide, (DMF), dimethylsulphoxide, (DMSO), and DMSO/DMA binary mixtures were used as solvents. There exists a linear correlation between log TCD and testing temperature and also for log (1 /TCD) and 1 /T (K^_ 1) which permit us to deduce apparent activation energy of breakup process to the fibre structure that occurs during TCD measurement. On the other hand the DMSO concentration in the mixture with DMA is related to TCD according to an exponential law: TCD = A + B. ee^_cx. TCD evolution has been studicd for 100 % relax, 100 % retractable and <b>High</b> <b>Bulk</b> (HB) <b>yarns.</b> Use of 15 / 85 mixture of DMSOIDMA in weight is suggested, and for the determination o£ TCD of acrylic fibres temperatures between 35 and 60 °C are recomended. In order to know the sensitivity of the technique in detecting structural variations during industrial handling of some of acrylic fibre articles, the variation in TCD, of different HB acrylic fibre yarns subjected to industrial treatments (steaming and dyeing) to develop bulkiness, has been studied. The technique is very sensitive in detecting structural fibre differences...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Two completely different approaches {{have been used to}} study the mechanism of the air-jet method of <b>bulking</b> filament <b>yarns.</b> Part A is an aerodynamic study {{of the nature of the}} air flow and of its characteristics, and of the yarn's behaviour during the bulking process. The experimentation involves the use of scaled-up models of the du Pant type 9 commercial Taslan air-jet and of a typically used parent yarn. The study is extended to include a modification of the jet suggested by earlier workers. The results of these investigations provide new evidence regarding the mechanism of the process and the construction of <b>bulked</b> <b>yarns</b> of this type. It is also concluded that the commercially used air-jet on which the model study has been based, is not ideally designed from the stand-point of efficiency, stability and ease of operation. In Part B, a suggested mechanism of the air-jet bulking action is simulated by a purely mechanical means. The simulation of the process has been so effective that yarns of the air-jet bulked type are produced by a method not requiring any compressed air. The preliminary work leading to the design of an experimental apparatus is briefly reported. Theoretical and experimental investigations of the process are made, and the <b>bulked</b> <b>yarn</b> properties for various parent yarn particulars and processing conditions are measured and assessed. An economic evaluation of the process has been attempted, based on a comparison with the limited cost figures available for Taslan processing. - The individual nature of each of the two main investigations has necessitated that the results should be separately discussed in the ultimate Chapter of each Part of the thesis. Suggestions for further work are also made for each of the two techniques...|$|R

By a combination of chemical impregnation of birch chips and pre-heating of the chips to high temperature prior to refining, it is possible to manufacture CTMP with very <b>high</b> <b>bulk</b> using a low energy input.

At 500 ml CSF an increase in the pre-heating temperature from 110 C to 160 C reduced the energy consumption by more than 40 %. Despite the low energy input, the shive content remained low or was even reduced and the internal bond strength, in terms of Scott-Bond, compared favourably with Spruce CTMP.

40|$|The {{response}} of the interface between matrix pockets and infiltrated fibre bundles, often encountered in 3 D woven composites, has been investigated experimentally. Fibre bundle pull out tests have been performed along with tensile experiments measuring the normal strength of the interface at quasi-static and high loading rates. The {{purpose of this study}} was to generate information that is necessary to numerically model 3 D woven composite materials on the meso scale (yarns, matrix pockets and yarn-matrix interface). The experiments show an increase of the interface strength for both the pull out tests and the tensile tests with loading rate. Failure for the pull out experiments always propagated along the interface between fibre bundle and matrix. However, failure for the tensile tests occurred both at the interface and within the yarn, at approximately the same level of stress. It is therefore concluded that the interface between matrix pocket and yarn can be assumed to have the properties of the <b>bulk</b> <b>yarn</b> material, and does not need to be modelled explicitly. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigate {{the dynamics of the}} LLSVPs through the use of evolutionary models of thermochemical convection from 250 Ma to present day. We use a spherical convection model in which the anomalous structures have a <b>high</b> <b>bulk</b> modulus, consistent with seismic interpretation. A new progressive assimilation method incorporates constraints from paleogeography using a refined plate history model (with 1 Myr time spacing) to guide the thermal structure of the lithosphere and steer the thermal evolution of slabs in the uppermost mantle. The thermochemical structures deform and migrate along the core-mantle boundary (CMB) through coupling to plate motions and in response to slab stresses. The models produce a ridge-like anomaly beneath Africa and a rounded pile beneath the Pacific Ocean, which at present day agrees with tomography, waveform modeling, and other geodynamic studies. Plumes emanate from the margins of the domes and ridges of thickened boundary layer between the domes.
