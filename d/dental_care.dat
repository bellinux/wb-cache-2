5|$|The players went {{on strike}} on July 13, 1970 after the owners locked them out for a brief period. The strike lasted for two days ending with a new four year CBA which was reached after the owners {{threatened}} to cancel the season. Due to the new agreement, the union won the right for players to bargain through their own agents with the clubs, and minimum salaries were increased to $12,500 for rookies and $13,000 for veterans. Also, players' pensions were improved and <b>dental</b> <b>care</b> {{was added to the}} players' insurance plans. Players also gained the right to select representation on the league's retirement board and the right to impartial arbitration for injury grievances. Following the 1970 agreement, many union representatives were released by their teams. Unfazed, the players were determined to create a stronger union through better communication. Attorney Ed Garvey was hired by the NFLPA in 1971 to act as their first executive director, and the NFLPA became officially certified as a union by the NLRB the same year. Headquarters were established in Washington, D.C. and a campaign was launched to help inform players of their rights.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background: Criticisms can {{be found}} in the media, and (false) {{promises}} {{can be found}} in politics; but what does the population really want? Is the current system defendable? Or are there reasons to reconsider <b>dental</b> health <b>care</b> as part of the Norwegian health care system? Objective: The purpose of this thesis was to attempt to determine whether it can be considered socioeconomically viable to replace the current private and public <b>dental</b> health <b>care</b> system in Norway with a wholly publicly financed <b>dental</b> health <b>care</b> scheme. Approach: In order to determine the socioeconomic viability of introducing a publicly financed <b>dental</b> health <b>care</b> system, three central aspects were considered. First, the status of the current system was evaluated, especially with regards to inspecting for existence of socioeconomic and geographical inequalities. Second, the population desirability of a <b>dental</b> health <b>care</b> reform was assessed from a theoretical standpoint based on arguments for the rise of nonmarket institutions. Finally this was complemented by measuring willingness-to-pay among a sample population; the elicited willingness-to-pay amounts were further compared with the estimated costs of a publicly financed <b>dental</b> health <b>care</b> scheme with the purpose of evaluating economic feasibility. Method: A contingent valuation method, via face-to-face and telephone interviews was used to assess willingness-to-pay. The collected data were further analyzed using binary logistic regression. To describe the extent of inequalities in the market, data from a cross-sectional living survey from 2008 undertaken by Statistics Norway was used as a foundation. These data were also analyzed using binary logistic regression. Results: The population is willing-to-pay for a publicly financed <b>dental</b> health <b>care</b> system. The amount’s individuals are willing-to-pay are varied, however, the average aggregate willingness-to-pay of 1930 NOK, was found to be sufficient to cover the predicted costs of a publicly financed scheme. These results are however bounded by the limitations of the study and analyses. Socioeconomic inequalities are prevalent in the current system, and these provide further evidence that implementation of a scheme could be advantageous. Conclusions: A universal publicly financed <b>dental</b> health <b>care</b> scheme is socioeconomically viable according to the findings in this thesis, but due to the limitations of the study especially with regards to generalizability, and further, to the organizational challenges of initiating a public scheme, additional research would be necessary prior to establishing any firm conclusions on implementation...|$|R

40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the extent of}} household catastrophic expenditure in <b>dental</b> health <b>care</b> and its possible determinants in 41 low and middle income countries. Data from 182, 007 respondents aged 18 years and over (69, 315 in 18 low income countries, 59, 645 in 15 lower middle income countries and 53, 047 in 8 upper middle income countries) {{who participated in the}} WHO World Health Survey (WHS) were analyzed. Expenditure in <b>dental</b> health <b>care</b> was defined as catastrophic if it was equal to or higher than 40 % of the household capacity to pay. A number of individual and country-level factors were assessed as potential determinants of catastrophic dental health expenditure (CDHE) in multilevel logistic regression with individuals nested within countries. Up to 7 % of households in low and middle income countries faced CDHE in the last 4 weeks. This proportion rose up to 35 % among households that incurred some dental health expenditure within the same period. The multilevel model showed that wealthier, urban and larger households and more economically developed countries had higher odds of facing CDHE. The results of this study show that payments for <b>dental</b> health <b>care</b> can be a considerable burden on households, to the extent of preventing expenditure on basic necessities. They also help characterize households more likely to incur catastrophic expenditure on <b>dental</b> health <b>care.</b> Alternative health care financing strategies and policies targeted to improve fairness in financial contribution are urgently required in low and middle income countries...|$|R

Results: The dental practitioners in Mashad had a low level of infection control knowledge. Dental personnel with a higher educational level had significantly greater knowledge than those with less education. Additionally, dental personnel who had more years of practice had a greater knowledge of infection control. Conclusion: Since dental practitioners working in Mashad governmental <b>dental</b> health <b>care</b> centers with fewer years of practice and less educational level had a low level of infection control knowledge, we recommend a continuing educational program for this group and dental nurses...|$|R
