50|$|Phase I {{reactions}} (also termed nonsynthetic reactions) {{may occur}} by oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, cyclization, <b>decyclization,</b> and addition of oxygen or removal of hydrogen, {{carried out by}} mixed function oxidases, often in the liver. These oxidative reactions typically involve a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (often abbreviated CYP), NADPH and oxygen. The classes of pharmaceutical drugs that utilize this method for their metabolism include phenothiazines, paracetamol, and steroids. If the metabolites of phase I reactions are sufficiently polar, they may be readily excreted at this point. However, many phase I products are not eliminated rapidly and undergo a subsequent reaction in which an endogenous substrate combines with the newly incorporated functional group to form a highly polar conjugate.|$|E
50|$|Alkenes undergo many {{important}} reactions that proceed via a photon-induced π to π* transition. The first electronic excited state of an alkene lack the π-bond, so that rotation about the C-C bond is rapid and the molecule engages in reactions not observed thermally. These reactions include cis-trans isomerization, cycloaddition to other (ground state) alkene to give cyclobutane derivatives. The cis-trans isomerization of a (poly)alkene {{is involved in}} retinal, {{a component of the}} machinery of vision. The dimerization of alkenes is relevant to the photodamage of DNA, where thymine dimers are observed upon illuminating DNA to UV radiation. Such dimers interfere with transcription. The beneficial effects of sunlight are associated with the photochemically induced retro-cyclization (<b>decyclization)</b> reaction of ergosterol to give vitamin D. In the DeMayo reaction, an alkene reacts with a 1,3-diketone reacts via its enol to yield a 1,5-diketone. Still another common photochemical reaction is Zimmerman's Di-pi-methane rearrangement.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} further the events leading to the metabolic degradation of tryptophan in Chlamydia-infected cultures in the absence of added interferon (IFN). Macrophages on coverslips were infected with Chlamydia psittaci, and tryptophan <b>decyclization</b> was determined 24 h later by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Tryptophan metabolites cochromatographed with kynurenine and N-formylkynurenine, the end products of tryptophan <b>decyclization</b> by the IFN-inducible enzyme indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO). Although chloramphenicol pretreatment completely inhibited chlamydial replication, IDO was stimulated to an extent similar to that in untreated, infected cells. No IDO induction was observed in cells pretreated with cycloheximide even though chlamydial growth was slightly greater than in untreated cells. These results indicate that enhanced tryptophan <b>decyclization</b> was due to induction of IDO. IDO induction was dependent on the size of the chlamydial inoculum. Heat- or UV-inactivated chlamydiae induced significantly less IDO activity than viable chlamydiae. Culture supernatants from Chlamydia-infected macrophages induced IDO activity in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that a secreted product of infected cells was responsible for IDO induction. A combination of neutralizing antibodies to IFN-alpha and IFN-beta inhibited induction of IDO activity by infected cell culture supernatants. Furthermore, IL- 1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay results indicated the accumulation of IL- 1 beta in the culture medium. Thus, induction of IDO in Chlamydia-infected macrophages reflects the production of cytokines in response to infection and may represent a normal host cell response to control intracellular infection...|$|E
40|$|A novel type of 5 -oxoprolinase {{was found}} in a cell extract of strain N- 38 A, which was later {{identified}} as Alcaligenes faecalis. The enzyme in the cell extract was purified to a homogeneous state with a yield of 16. 6 %. The molecular weight of the purified enzyme was estimated to be 47, 000 by both sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration, suggesting that the enzyme is a monomeric protein. The enzyme specifically catalyzed a <b>decyclization</b> of l-pyroglutamate without hydrolyzing ATP and also without any requirements for metal ions such as Mg 2 + and K+. The optimal pH for the <b>decyclization</b> was 7. 4. The reaction was reversible. The equilibrium constant of the reaction, Keq = [l-glutamate]/[l-pyroglutamate], was evaluated to be approximately 0. 035, which indicates that the reaction tends to form l-pyroglutamate. The amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme was H-Glu-Pro-Arg-Leu-Asp-Thr-Ser-Gln-Leu-Tyr-Ala-Asp-Val-His-Phe-. No protein with a similar sequence {{was found in}} the DNASIS database. Based on these data, it was strongly suggested that the enzyme described here is a novel type of 5 -oxoprolinase...|$|E

40|$|Over 20 gram-positive {{bacteria}} {{were isolated}} by elective culture with (+/-) -alpha-pinene {{as the sole}} carbon source. One of these strains, Nocardia sp. strain P 18. 3, was selected for detailed study. alpha-Pinene-grown cells oxidized, without lag, alpha-pinene, alpha-pinene oxide (epoxide), and the cis and trans isomers of 2 -methyl- 5 -isopropylhexa- 2, 5 -dienal. No other tested terpene was oxidized at a significant rate. alpha-Pinene was not metabolized by cell extracts in {{the presence or absence}} of NADH or NADPH. Cell extracts catalyzed a rapid <b>decyclization</b> of alpha-pinene oxide, in the absence of added cofactors, with the formation of cis- 2 -methyl- 5 -isopropylhexa- 2, 5 -dienal. Further oxidation of the aldehyde to the corresponding acid occurred in the presence of NAD. Both activities were induced by growth with alpha-pinene. A rapid, nonenzymic transformation of the cis aldehyde into the trans isomer occurred in glycine buffer. The trans isomer was also a substrate for the NAD-linked aldehyde dehydrogenase. The distribution of the alpha-pinene oxide lyase in alpha-pinene-utilizing Pseudomonas spp. was also investigated and was compatible with the two alternative ring-cleavage sequences that have been proposed on the basis of accumulated metabolites...|$|E
40|$|Parachlamydia acanthamoebae is an obligate {{intracellular}} bacterium naturally infecting free-living amoebae. This potential {{agent of}} pneumonia resists destruction by human macrophages, inducing their death by apoptosis. However, the strategy used by Parachlamydia {{to escape the}} microbicidal effectors of macrophages remains unknown. In this work, we defined the effect of Parachlamydia on the cytokine secretion (measured in culture supernatants by immunoassays), on the oxidative burst (measured using a fluorogenic probe), on the production of nitric oxide (Griess assay), and on transcription of glutaredoxin, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO). Living Parachlamydia did not induce an oxidative burst, the secretion of cytokines such as IL- 6, IL- 10 and TNF-alpha, nor the transcription of TNF-alpha in macrophages. However, living Parachlamydia led to increased secretion of IL- 1 beta and increased transcription of glutaredoxin, an anti-oxidant. The transcription of IDO, an enzyme, which catalyzes <b>decyclization</b> of l-tryptophan, was slightly up-regulated. Heat-inactivated Parachlamydia did not induce either an oxidative burst or the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In contrast to living bacteria, it {{had no effect on}} the IL- 1 beta release, but it induced IL- 10 secretion. In conclusion, after being internalized, Parachlamydia may resist the microbicidal effectors of human macrophages through not inducing oxidative burst and pro-inflammatory cytokine production...|$|E

The new {{data about the}} peculiairites of flow of the non-catalytic and catalytic reactions of the derivatives of the aroilpyrovine acids in the different media have been obtained. The effective intramolycular catalysis of the carboxyl group in the reactions of aroilpyrovine acids with arylamines has been found.

40|$|Red‐emitting {{variants}} of Green Fluorescent Protein {{are widely used}} as biomarkers for monitoring cellular processes in vivo. The pressure dependence of fluorescence, which can provide information on protein stability, has been studied for green‐, blue‐, and yellow-emitting variants (1 ‐ 3), but this relationship {{has not yet been}} explored for red‐emitting variants. In the present work, the fluorescence of the red fluorescent proteins TagRFP‐S, TagRFP‐T, mCherry, mOrange 2, mStrawberry, and mKO were studied as a function of pressure {{through the use of a}} diamond anvil cell. Variants TagRFP‐S, TagRFP‐T, mOrange 2, and mStrawberry showed an initial increase in fluorescence intensity upon application of pressure above ambient conditions. This effect is probably due to a reduction in conformational flexibility of their chromophores. At higher pressures, the fluorescence intensity decreases dramatically for all proteins under study. This fluorescence depletion resulted from chromophore pocket deformation and pressure‐induced denaturation. Mild blue shifts in fluorescence peaks were seen in all of the proteins as pressure was increased, consistent with a change in Franck‐Condon factors due to limited flexibility of the chromophores. In two variants, mOrange 2 and mStrawberry, an abrupt change in the fluorescence spectra occurs at higher pressures. In mStrawberry, the fluorescence spectrum shifts strongly to the blue, which may be caused by the protonation of the chromophoric phenoxide. In mOrange 2, a pronounced red shift in the fluorescence spectrum may be the result of the <b>decyclization</b> of the dihydrooxazole ring in the chromophore. Pressure‐dependent fluorescence depletion was found to be partially reversible in mOrange 2 and mStrawberry...|$|E
40|$|Small {{molecule}} synthesis {{has become}} a valuable tool {{in the study of}} biological systems. Biologically active compounds can be designed based on well-characterized endogenous systems or they can be found through the screening of large libraries of small molecules. This work involves the development of a small library of cyclic thiourea-based small molecules by use of an unreported synthetic pathway. Briefly, parent thioureas were cyclized by reaction with bromoacetyl bromide, and one or two isomeric heterocycles were found to form. Further studies indicated that the reaction could be easily manipulated by temperature or solvent to effectively control the product distribution. These iminothiozolidinones were characterized by single crystal x-ray analysis. The new reaction was explored in an effort to uncover the factors influencing the control of the isomer formation. Furthermore, these iminothiozolidinones underwent a novel <b>decyclization</b> reaction that resulted in the loss of the parent thiourea connectivity and incorporation of an external nucleophile to yield an aminooxoethylcarbamothionate. The reaction proceeds through a termolecular mechanism. These reactions can be combined to a one-pot reaction series. These compounds share similarities with a class of compounds reported to be known HIV- 1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors 94. In addition to these new synthetic reactions, work was conducted with a previously developed cyclen thiourea receptor for the anionic dye HPTS and its derivatives 50 - 52. This system was used to develop a cell labeling assay that led to the amplification of fluorescent labeling of target cells through the use of liposomes. Briefly, a dye-ligand conjugate for the glycine receptor was synthesized. Liposomes functionalized with the cyclen receptor were prepared encapsulating Rhodamine B. Confocal microscopy studies demonstrated the binding of the HPTS-ligand to the cell membranes. Addition of the liposomes resulted in quenching of the green fluorescence, indicating binding of the cyclen to HPTS. Subsequent excitation of Rhodamine B showed red fluorescence associated with the cells. The intensity of the red signal was demonstrably higher than for the signal resulting from the binding of the ligand-dye to the receptor. Together, these projects increase the synthetic usefulness of thiourea based small molecules and demonstrate the potential biological applications of related compounds...|$|E
40|$|Growth of {{a variety}} of human tumor cell lines is {{inhibited}} by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in vitro. This mechanism is not well understood. The present experiments identify two separate mechanisms which account for the growth inhibitory activity of IFN-gamma. Cell lines most sensitive to IFN-gamma (inhibited by 10 - 30 U/ml IFN-gamma in 3 d) were stimulated by IFN-gamma to oxidize tryptophan in media to kynurenine and completely eliminated tryptophan from the culture media after 48 - 72 h. Addition of L-tryptophan, but not other aromatic amino acids, other essential amino acids, or D-tryptophan, prevented inhibition of cell growth by IFN-gamma. The amount of IFN-gamma required to yield 50 % inhibition of cell growth was directly related to the concentration of L-tryptophan in culture media and increased from approximately 3 to 600 U/ml as the concentration of tryptophan in the media was increased from 25 to 1, 000 microM. By contrast, inhibition of growth of the cell lines, BT 20 and HT 29, was not prevented by addition of tryptophan. Inhibition by IFN-gamma (100 - 300 U/ml after 5 - 6 d) was, however, completely prevented by addition of two inhibitors of adenosine diphosphate-ribosyl transferase (ADP-RT), 3 -aminobenzamide or nicotinamide. Activity of ADP-RT was increased in these cell lines after addition of IFN-gamma. ADP-RT catalyzes the incorporation of the ADP moiety of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) into proteins and causes depletion of intracellular NAD. All tumor cell lines tested had reduced levels of intracellular NAD after treatment with IFN-gamma and loss of NAD preceded inhibition of cell growth by 12 - 24 h. Inhibitors of IFN-gamma-mediated inhibition of cell growth prevented loss of levels of intracellular NAD. Generation of reactive oxygen species lead to DNA strand breaks which result in activation of ADP-RT. Increased DNA strand breaks were induced in BT 20 and HT 29 cells but not ME 180 and A 549 cells after culture with IFN-gamma. The two enzymes known to catalyze the <b>decyclization</b> of tryptophan to kynurenine require superoxide anion for activity. Increased amounts of superoxide anion were released from ME 180 and A 549 cells after culture with IFN-gamma. Reduced oxygen concentration decreased the ability of IFN-gamma to inhibit tumor cell growth in vitro. Intracellular glutathione has been shown to protect cells against oxidative damage by various agents. Elevation or reduction of intracellular glutathione concentrations lowered or raised sensitivity of cell lines to IFN-gamma, respectively. These data indicate that at least two distinct mechanisms can account for IFN-gamma-madiated inhibition of tumor cell growth. Both mechanisms appear to be sensitive to oxygen tension and to changes in intracellular glutathione concentrations, and both mechanisms lead to loss of intracellular NAD...|$|E
40|$|Pressure-dependent product yields {{have been}} {{experimentally}} determined for the cross-radical reaction C 2 H 5 + C 2 H 3. These {{results have been}} extended by calculations. It is shown that the chemically activated combination adduct, 1 -C 4 H 8 *, is either stabilized by bimolecular collisions or subject {{to a variety of}} unimolecular reactions including cyclizations and decompositions. Therefore the "apparent" combination/disproportionation ratio exhibits a complex pressure dependence. The experimental studies were performed at 298 K and at selected pressures between about 4 Torr (0. 5 kPa) and 760 Torr (101 kPa). Ethyl and vinyl radicals were simultaneously produced by 193 nm excimer laser photolysis of C 2 H 5 COC 2 H 3 or photolysis of C 2 H 3 Br and C 2 H 5 COC 2 H 5. Gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry/flame ionization detection (GC/MS/FID) were used to identify and quantify the final reaction products. The major combination reactions at pressures between 500 (66. 5 kPa) and 760 Torr are (1 c) C 2 H 5 + C 2 H 3 yields 1 -butene, (2 c) C 2 H 5 + C 2 H 5 yields n-butane, and (3 c) C 2 H 3 + C 2 H 3 yields 1, 3 -butadiene. The major products of the disproportionation reactions are ethane, ethylene, and acetylene. At moderate and lower pressures, secondary products, including propene, propane, isobutene, 2 -butene (cis and trans), 1 -pentene, 1, 4 -pentadiene, and 1, 5 -hexadiene are also observed. Two isomers of C 4 H 6, cyclobutene and/or 1, 2 -butadiene, were also among the likely products. The pressure-dependent yield of the cross-combination product, 1 -butene, was compared to the yield of n-butane, the combination product of reaction (2 c), which was found to be independent of pressure over the range of this study. The [1 -C 4 H 8]/[C 4 H 10] ratio was reduced from approx. 1. 2 at 760 Torr (101 kPa) to approx. 0. 5 at 100 Torr (13. 3 kPa) and approx. 0. 1 at pressures lower than about 5 Torr (approx. 0. 7 kPa). Electronic structure and RRKM calculations were used to simulate both unimolecular and bimolecular processes. The relative importance of C-C and C-H bond ruptures, cyclization, <b>decyclization,</b> and complex decompositions are discussed in terms of energetics and structural properties. The pressure dependence of the product yields were computed and dominant reaction paths in this chemically activated system were determined. Both modeling and experiment suggest that the observed pressure dependence of [1 -C 4 H 8]/[C 4 H 10] is due to decomposition of the chemically activated combination adduct 1 -C 4 H 8 * in which the weaker allylic C-C bond is broken: H 2 C=CHCH 2 CH 3 yields C 3 H 5 + CH 3. This reaction occurs even at moderate pressures of approx. 200 Torr (26 kPa) and becomes more significant at lower pressures. The additional products detected at lower pressures are formed from secondary radical-radical reactions involving allyl, methyl, ethyl, and vinyl radicals. The modeling studies have extended the predictions of product distributions to different temperatures (200 - 700 K) and a wider range of pressures (10 (exp - 3) - 10 (exp 5) Torr). These calculations indicate that the high-pressure [1 -C 4 H 8]/[C 4 H 10] yield ratio is 1. 3 +/- 0. 1...|$|E
