25|$|Later {{applications}} of continuously supported track include Balfour Beatty's 'embedded slab track', {{which uses a}} rounded rectangular rail profile (BB14072) embedded in a slipformed (or pre-cast) concrete base (development 2000s). The 'embedded rail structure', used in the Netherlands since 1976, initially used a conventional UIC54 rail <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> <b>concrete,</b> and later developed (late 1990s) to use a 'mushroom' shaped SA42 rail profile; a version for light rail using a rail supported in an asphalt concrete–filled steel trough has also been developed (2002).|$|E
25|$|Walton {{also ordered}} the storm {{door at the}} {{entrance}} to the White House beneath the North Portico removed so that the coffin would pass more easily through the portal. The door was removed, but the frame (<b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> <b>concrete)</b> was not. Black crepe was tacked around the door to cover it. Shriver had the White House driveway lit with small firepots. Kennedy's body arrived at the White House at about 4:30 A.M. The military casket team moved the coffin into the East Room and set it on the catafalque. Walton gave General Godfrey McHugh, Kennedy's chief military aide, a spray of flowers to place at the long base of the catafalque.|$|E
25|$|The site itself {{suggests}} a building complex of importance, commanding extensive sea views. It was surrounded, {{on at least}} three sides, by an esplanade delimited by a semicircular wall which extended {{from east to west}} and can be followed for a length of about 62metres. Today, only the foundation stones, cut in squared limestone blocks, survive but a plan of the cluster of rectangular rooms grouped round a central courtyard can still be made out. The pavement of small white marble cubes <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> <b>concrete,</b> and a few diamond-shaped tiles survived in one of the rooms until 1977, but by 1988, these had disappeared. In the centre of the main room, there are two well dressed oblong stones, which were thought to form part of an altar.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the results}} of site {{investigations}} on durability and deterioration of the reinforced concrete school houses of junior high schools in Naha City are described. In general, the school houses are damaged seriously due to corrosion of reinforcing bars <b>embeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>concrete.</b> The rate of school houses damaged in columns and beams to all school buidilngs amounts to 29. 4 %, and 77. 9 % is the rate of school houses damaged in slabs. Some fundamental measures to improve above mentioned serious conditions must be taken against corrosion of reinforcing bars <b>embeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>concrete.</b> The followings must be also mentioned: 1. Contractcr's men and inspectors have little knowledge about durability of reinforced concrete. 2. Inspection works <b>in</b> <b>concrete</b> construction must be done more severely, especially, in reinforcing steel bar placing. 3. The average salt content <b>in</b> <b>concrete</b> samples taken from school houses is 0. 23 % in mortar weights. This figure is the least one in the series of the school house investigativns in Okinawa Prefecture. But this quantity is enough to corrode the steel bars <b>embeded</b> <b>in</b> <b>concrete,</b> and the salt contained <b>in</b> <b>concrete</b> {{is responsible for the}} school house damages mentioned above. 4. The above mentioned salt contained <b>in</b> <b>concrete</b> comes from sea sand and mixing water. 5. To promote the durability of school houses in Naha City; 1) The salt contained <b>in</b> <b>concrete</b> must be minimized by use of tap water as mixing water and de-salt-action～washing the sea sand by tap water or rain-fall. 2) Inhibitors against steel rusting are to be used. 3) Good quality concrete (low water cement ratio and low water content) must be used and carefull concrete work must be done. 4) Rain-stopping inverse channels in laves are to be harmful. 5) The number of outside exposed surfaces of school houses must be minimized, such as outside corridors, outside stairs, and laves. 6) The depth of concrete cover on reinforcing bar must be increased...|$|R

500|$|A first railway {{project for}} the mountain, later known by the name , was {{presented}} in 1876 by Cordier; {{it was one of}} the far-flung ideas that the railway companies often had in the 19th century. Because classical rail has poor adherence, Cordier designed a raceway made of two granite rails <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> <b>concrete</b> with a continuous guide rail between them. The [...] line, with a terminus at the Quai de la Bourse, would be served by steam carriages with a capacity of only 30 places, but capable of running on public streets as well as its special track.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{behavior}} of channel shear connectors, <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> a <b>concrete</b> slab, with different concrete materials. The results {{of a series of}} limited push-out specimens were presented and discussed. The push-out tests comprise of channel shear connectors in different types of concrete. Reinforcement was included in some specimens, as well. The results showed that using reinforcements <b>in</b> <b>concrete</b> slab, enhances the ductility and shear capacity of the composite system and using channels <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> unconfined normal <b>concrete,</b> has a brittle performance. The channel shear capacity is less in the lightweight aggregate concrete, compared to the normal ones. Adequate ductility was reported for the channel shear connectors in most of the <b>concrete</b> types. <b>In</b> addition, it was verified that the channel connector presents a very rigid behavior, during the primary phase of loading. Using channel connectors with longer length can increase the ductility of the system. In general, the channel shear connector showed a ductile behavior. The results verified using channel shear connectors, <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> tested <b>concrete,</b> <b>in</b> composite structures. The results also discussed the effect of different concrete types, on the ductility and load–displacement performance of the specimens.

2500|$|The railway was {{required}} because {{the core of}} the Caban-coch, Pen-y-garreg and Craig-goch dams were built from large irregular stone blocks ("plums") <b>embedded</b> <b>in</b> <b>concrete.</b> The rock was mined locally from Cigfran and Craig-cnwch quarries by the Elan River and the Aberdeuddwr quarry on Cerrig Gwynion, just to the south of Rhayader. The shaped stones were hauled by locomotive to the dam sites on flatbed trucks. They were then lowered into place by steam crane. The central cores of the dams were encased with a [...] concrete lining. The outside walls were faced with cut stone brought from quarries at Llanelwedd near Builth Wells and Pontypridd. The cement, which was made near Chatham in Kent, was sent by sea to Aberystwyth and brought by railway to the Elan Valley.|$|E
