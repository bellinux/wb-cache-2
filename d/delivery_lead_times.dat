Lead times occur in the planning, production, inventories and handling of products (Treville et al., 2003). The aim {{of the study is}} to develop a method to analyze the factors that affect the length of internal delivery lead time in manufacturing companies.

40|$|Manufacturers {{today are}} {{increasingly}} adopting a dual channel {{to sell their}} products, i. e., the traditional retail channel and an online direct channel. Empirical {{studies have shown that}} service quality (we focus on the <b>delivery</b> <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> of the direct channel) even goes beyond product price as one of the major factors influencing consumer acceptance of the direct channel. <b>Delivery</b> <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> has significant effects on demand, profit, and pricing strategy. However, there is scant literature addressing the decision on the promised <b>delivery</b> <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> of a direct channel {{and its impact on the}} manufacturer's and retailer's pricing decisions. To fill this gap, we examine the optimal decisions of <b>delivery</b> <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> and prices in a centralized and a decentralized dual-channel supply chain using the two-stage optimization technique and Stackelberg game, and analyze the impacts of <b>delivery</b> <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> and customer acceptance of a direct channel on the manufacturer's and retailer's pricing behaviours.

40|$|This {{report is}} the result of a case study at Peltor AB during the spring {{semester}} of 2007. The task Peltor gave us was to improve the delivery accuracy and to lower the high finical value of delayed orders (backorder), and to divide the products into logical groups. The logical group will be a useful tool to remain a high level of service. If the level of service increases the company will be more competitive. The electronic department at Peltor has problems with delayed orders. According to Peltor, the problem is based on delivery lead time which is presumed. To increase the delivery accuracy, a lead time analysis is made to find the accumulated <b>delivery</b> <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> for each product. This is a way for Peltor to give the customer a more correct delivery lead time when the order is placed. The analysis shows that many of the <b>delivery</b> <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> which the company use today, are often miscalculated. The difference can be either longer or shorter than the presumed lead time. One example of a longer lead time is when the accumulated lead time is 91 days and the presumed lead time is 30 days. The difference will be 61 days, and this is the major reason why Peltor thinks products end up in the “backorder”. Our result shows that there are more factors than the delivery lead time which affects whether an order will be delivered on time or not...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an optimal}} replacement strategy for capital intensive equipment with long delivery lead time. The strategy {{is based on}} an extended version of the real options approach to repeated replacement decisions, in which the goal is to determine the operating cost and delivery lead-time conditions upon which a replacement should be ordered. The real options approach to capital replacement problems is superior to traditional net present value (NPV) approaches, as it values of the option to adapt decisions based on current (rather than predicted) system conditions. However, previous applications of the real options approach to repeated replacement have not considered the impact of long and uncertain lead times, and have therefore focused on when to replace rather than when to order. <b>Delivery</b> <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> are an important consideration in an expanding mining sector in which demand for heavy mobile equipment (HME) exceeds the capacity of suppliers to provide the equipment in a timely manner. The inclusion of a lead time element results in a decision with an option period and an option-less period. Simulations are used to demonstrate the improved outcome of real options based replacement strategies compared with those derived using a traditional NPV approach, both with and without lead times. Further the performance of the order placement strategy with different boundary conditions, bounded and reflecting, is explored. No appreciable difference in performance of these strategies was identified. The optimal order placement strategy incorporating <b>delivery</b> <b>lead</b> <b>times</b> is displayed on a simple chart which is accessible to fleet management personnel...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Pursuit of {{globalization}} strategy for both market penetration and cost reduction {{is a common}} trend. This paper is addressing some of the implications and management of cost reduction strategies. As the market becomes more competitive, manufacturers are taking steps to move sourcing and manufacturing to Low Cost Countries (LCCs). A global telecommunications company sources almost 90 % of the total purchases from Asia, and China contributes to 90 % of the Asian procurement bill. While this reduces the per-piece price of the product, it increases the planning and logistical complexities in-terms of increased lead-times and planning horizons. At the same time, for similar reasons, customers have become more demanding and are increasingly looking out for shorter <b>delivery</b> <b>lead</b> <b>times.</b> Presently, outsourcing is a norm fo...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{provides}} managerial insight to pursue Collaborative Planning Forecasting and Replenishment (CPFR) or Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) strategy {{for both the}} retailer and manufacturer under different supply chain settings.

The conceptual model is a two-echelon production-inventory system with a manufac-turer and a retailer. The {{results from this study}} suggest that when compared to TSC, both VMI and CPFR achieve cost benefits in inventory management for both the manufacturer and retailer. Under most supply chain settings, higher cost benefits are achieved in CPFR compared to VMI. Also, CPFR achieves higher cost benefits when demand variability is high, production capacity is low, backorder penalty cost is high and <b>delivery</b> <b>lead</b> <b>time</b> is long.
