40|$|A novel {{unsupervised}} learning method for extracting spatio-temporal invariances has been <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> (<b>Stone,</b> 1995). The learning method works {{by trying to}} jointly minimise the short term variance of a unit's output, whilst maximising the long term variance of the output. The learning method {{has been applied to}} extracting disparity from a temporal sequence of random dot stereograms. This paper reports on developing and applying the learning method to a spatial task, both in one and two dimensions. Random dot stereograms were used as input to a three layer feedforward network. After learning, output units in the network became selective for disparity. This confirms the usefulness of the learning method, and leads the way to creating a full spatio-temporal model, using both temporal and spatial information. 1 Introduction An {{unsupervised learning}} method of extracting perceptual invariances from a sequence of images has been <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> (<b>Stone,</b> 1995).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel coupled model of discrete element method (DEM) and {{finite difference method}} (FDM) to investigate the load-deformation of stone columns reinforced soft clay. In the proposed model, the soft clay domain was modelled by the continuum method using FLAC and stone column was modelled by the discrete element method using PFC 2 D. Algorithms and mathematical framework to assist coupling between the two domains were introduced, in which the DEM transfers forces and moment to the FDM and then the FDM provides an update of displacements to the DEM. The predicted load-deformation responses obtained from the coupling model reasonably agreed well with data measured experimentally, indicating that the proposed coupling discrete-continuum model could capture the deformation behavior of stone column stabilized soft clay. Evolutions of contact force distributions <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> <b>stone</b> column at varying levels of settlement were presented. Shear stress-strain contours induced in the surrounding soft soils were also investigated...|$|E

40|$|People with {{cochlear}} {{hearing loss}} have a reduced dynamic range of hearing, thus amplitude compression may provide adequate amplification of soft sounds without uncomfortable over-amplification of loud sounds caused by conventional linear amplification. Although compression is conceptually straightforward, there are various design parameters that may affect the intelligibility of speech, the quality of sounds, {{and the perception of}} background noise. Four combinations of the Dual Front-End automatic gain control (AGC) system were implemented: (1) The Dual Front-End with a Hold Timer <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> <b>Stone</b> et al. [8], which aimed at reducing pumping effects while maintaining a relatively fast release; (2) The Dual Front-End with the SNR Estimator, investigated by Martin et al. [4], designed to provide a varying release time constant depending on the SNR level; (3) The Dual Front-End with both the Hold Timer and the SNR Estimator; (4) The Dual Front-End by itself, without the Hold Timer or the SNR Estimator. A fifth system, composed of linear amplification and compression limiting, was implemented {{to be used as a}} reference condition. A variety of stimuli consisting of speech at different levels and speech plus environmental sounds were processed by the five systems and presented over headphones to three hearing-impaired subjects. Subjects rated the processed stimuli for intelligibility and quality. While no clear differences were found among the four compression systems, there were some major differences between the Dual Front-End systems and the Linear system. The direction of these differences varied with subject, and to a lesser degree, with stimulus condition. In addition, compression systems generally performed better in stimuli conditions with low SNRs, indicating that compression may be useful for suppression of background noise. by Ivan Aguayo.

40|$|The {{recovery}} of understory vegetation after clear-cutting of stone pine (Pinus pinea L.) plantations {{is crucial for}} biodiversity conservation. The development of plant cover, and the richness, diversity and composition of understory plant communities were investigated within five years from clear-cutting. After three years, plant cover ranged from 48 to 74 %, and was formed by over 90 % of shrubs and graminoids. Diversity decreased in cut plots and the index of similarity showed marked shifts in species composition. Richness increased and around 50 new species per plot were inventoried over three years. New species showed {{a high proportion of}} annuals with broad ecological amplitude and aliens, which changed life form and chorology spectra. Most new species had low frequency, but some were still present after five years. Extinction of resident species was low, and their frequency increased with time from clear-cutting. Most of them were perennials with sprouting ability. Common features of plant communities <b>developing</b> <b>in</b> clear-cut <b>stone</b> pine plantations were: (1) the linear increase of plant cover during the first three growing seasons, (2) increased species richness, (3) decreased diversity, (4) invasion by annuals, and (5) invasion by Alien and Cosmopolitan species...|$|R

40|$|Experimental {{studies and}} {{numerical}} modelling of the deformation of soft clay stabilised by stone columns {{have been conducted}} {{over the past few}} decades. Continuum-based numerical models have provided valuable insight into the prediction of settlement, lateral deformation, and stress and strain-rate dependent behaviour of stone columns at a macroscopic scale, but because they consist of granular material such as crushed rock, gravel, and waste rock aggregates, their behaviour is influenced by inter-particle micromechanics and cannot be modelled properly using these models. In this paper a novel coupled model of the discrete element method (DEM) and finite difference method (FDM) is presented to study the deformation of a single <b>stone</b> column installed <b>in</b> soft ground. In this coupled discrete-continuum method, PFC 2 D and FLAC were used to model the interaction between the stone column and surrounding clay, respectively. The contact forces at the interface between the two zones were determined through a socket connection that allows the DEM to transfer forces and moments to the FDM and vice versa. The predicted results were comparable to the data measured experimentally, showing that the coupled discrete-continuum model proposed in this study could simulate the load-deformation behaviour of a <b>stone</b> column installed <b>in</b> clay. The contact force distribution and shear stress contour <b>developed</b> <b>in</b> the <b>stone</b> column and surrounding clay were captured to provide {{a better understanding of the}} load-deformation behaviour of the stone column...|$|R

40|$|Young Aboriginal {{children}} in remote regions of tropical and desert Australia {{are at risk}} of <b>developing</b> urate <b>stones</b> <b>in</b> their upper urinary tract from an early age. These radiolucent calculi were only recognized with the availability of ultrasound diagnosis and are not associated with anatomic anomalies or abnormal uric acid production/metabolism. Although these stones appear to resolve spontaneously after the weaning period, some result in ureteric obstruction and infection which may lead to renal damage. This pattern of urolithiasis differs from the usual global urolithiasis pattern of either endemic bladder <b>stones</b> <b>in</b> young children <b>in</b> <b>developing</b> countries or predominantly calcium-based <b>stones</b> <b>in</b> upper tracts of older children and adults in affluent industrialized countries, where upper tract urate stones account for only a minority of childhood urinary tract stones. Risk factors for urate stones are low urine output and acidic urine. An association between urolithiasis and carbohydrate intolerance leading to chronic acidosis has been suggested for Aboriginal children, but existing limited evidence does not support this as a major aetiological factor. Although further studies on the epidemiology, natural history and management of these urate stones are needed, we believe the focus should be on improving the known social and environmental risk factors of remote Aboriginal children during the weaning period which contribute to the unacceptably high prevalence of failure to thrive, diarrhoeal disease, environmental enteropathy, iron deficiency and urolithiasis...|$|R
40|$|Real time {{ultrasonography}} {{was used}} to compare the prevalence of gall <b>stones</b> <b>in</b> two groups of women aged 40 - 69 : 632 women recruited from general practice registers and 130 vegetarians.

The prevalence of gall stones was found to increase with age and body mass index. The 2. 5 fold increase <b>in</b> risk of <b>developing</b> gall <b>stones</b> <b>in</b> non-vegetarians compared with vegetarians was reduced to 1. 9 when controlling for these two potentially confounding factors, but remained significant. A family history of gall stones was reported more often by women with gall stones, but no association was found with parity or use of exogenous oestrogens. Thus the importance of age and obesity to determine the prevalence of gall stone was confirmed, and a dietary factor associated with vegetarianism may prevent this common condition...|$|R
