50|$|The <b>Himalayan</b> <b>yew</b> {{has been}} subject to heavy {{exploitation}} for its leaves and bark across most of its range through the Himalayas and western China. Declines have been particularly heavy in India and Nepal, with losses of up to 90% having been reported. The degree of exploitation in other locations in its range is less well known, but is also assumed to be serious. The species is currently classified as endangered by the IUCN. It is present in several protected areas, and at least some conservation and propagation measures are underway, {{with an eye to}} its commercial value in the medicine trade.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Himalayan</b> <b>yew</b> {{is found}} in China (Yunnan and Sichuan), Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan, Pakistan, India (Arunachal Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Assam), Myanmar, and some parts of Viet Nam. It is also present in the Philippines, Sulawesi and Sumatra. The species favours a {{reasonably}} wide range of habitats, growing in montane, temperate, warm temperate, and tropical submontane to high montane forests which may be deciduous, evergreen, or of mixed character. In forests, it tends to present as a low canopy tree; in open situations it usually forms a large, broadly spreading shrub. Elevation ranges from 900 m to 3,700 m.|$|E
50|$|Characteristic of the sub-alpine zone {{are high}} {{altitude}} forests which help to retain moisture and snow and support {{a large number}} of floral and faunal communities. It is dominated by the uncommon Himalayan maple Acer caesium (VU), west Himalayan fir Abies pindrow, Himalayan white birch Betula utilis, and Rhododendron campanulatum with <b>Himalayan</b> <b>yew</b> Taxus wallichiana, Syringa emodi and Sorbus lanata.

40|$|ABSTRACTTaxus wallichiana Zucc., {{known as}} <b>Himalayan</b> <b>yew,</b> {{belongs to the}} family Taxaceae. It is a medium-sized, temperate, Himalayan forest tree of {{medicinal}} importance. In India, this evergreen tree is found at altitudes between 1800 and 3300 m {{above mean sea level}} (MSL). It has been used by the native populations for treating common cold, cough, fever, and pain. Its uses are described in Ayurveda and Unani medicine. It received attention recently as its leaves and bark were found to be the prime source of taxol, a potent anticancer drug. It possesses many other biological activities also. We focus on its importance in traditional medicine for its multiple medicinal properties...|$|E
40|$|Plants {{synthesize}} certain Phytoconstituents {{for their}} protection, which, {{because they are}} not of primary need, are known as secondary metabolites. Plant cell factories constitute an alternative source of high added value phytochemical. These secondary metabolites of plants have often been found to have medicinal uses for human beings. One such gymnosperm having secondary metabolites of medicinal potential for humans is Taxus wallichiana (<b>Himalayan</b> <b>yew).</b> this plant has been investigated for its essential oil, diterpenoids, lignans, steroids, sterols and biflavonoids. Traditionally, it is used to treat disorders of the digestive, respiratory, nervous and skeletal systems. Although pharmacologically underexplored, it has been used for antiepileptic, anti-inflammatory,anticancer, antipyretic, analgesic, immunomodulatory and antimicrobial activities. The present review compiles traditional uses, phytochemical constituents (specifically the secondary metabolites) pharmacological activities and the toxicity of T. wallichiana. This review is focused on recent advances in the production of taxol and related taxanes in Taxus baccata, After a short overview of taxol production at an industrial level, the review focuses on taxol biosynthesis in plant cells and the attempts to produce taxol in T. baccata cell cultures, giving particular emphasis to the optimization steps that have improved production, and including the most recently developed new tools and Taxines are the active, poisonou...|$|E
40|$|Pestalotiopsis microspora, isolate NE- 32, is an {{endophyte}} of the <b>Himalayan</b> <b>yew</b> (Taxus wallichiana) {{that produces}} taxol, an important chemotherapeutic drug {{used in the}} treatment of breast and ovarian cancers. Conditions were determined to induce the perfect stage (teleomorph) of this organism in the laboratory as a critical first step to study inheritance of taxol biosynthetic genes. The perfect stage of Pestalotiopsis microspora NE- 32 forms in a period of 3 – 6 weeks on water agarose with dried yew needles at 16 – 20 SC with 12 h of light per day. Morphological analysis of the teleomorph and sequencing of the 18 S rDNA indicates that Pestalosphaeria hansenii is the perfect stage of Pestalotiopsis microspora. Only certain plants (e. g. yews, some pines, pecan, oat and some barley cultivars) allow the production of perithecia. Exhaustive methylene chloride extraction of yew (Taxus cuspidata) needles removes their capacity to induce production of perithecia. The methylene chloride extract is able to induce formation of perithecia by strain NE- 32 in a bioassay system utilizing the sterilized sheaths of the Cholla cactus (Opuntia bigelovii) spine, indicating that a chemical compound(s) in yew stimulates the formation of the perfect stage. This hydrophobic plant compound(s) has been designated the perithecial-stimulating factor (PSF). The data suggest that plant products {{may play a role in}} regulating the biology of endophytic microbes...|$|E
