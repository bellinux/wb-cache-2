40|$|Spreadsheet {{software}} is the tool of choice for interactive ad-hoc data management, with adoption by billions of users. However, spreadsheets are not scalable, unlike database systems.

We are developing DataSpread, to holistically <b>integrate</b> <b>spreadsheets</b> as a front-end interface with databases as a back-end datastore, providing scalability to spreadsheets, and interactivity to databases, an integration we term presentational data management (PDM).

We first conduct an extensive survey of spreadsheet use to motivate our functional requirements for a storage engine for PDM. We develop a natural set of mechanisms for flexibly representing spreadsheet data and demonstrate that identifying the optimal representation is NP-Hard; however, we develop an efficient approach to identify the optimal representation from an important and intuitive subclass of representations. We extend our mechanisms with positional access mechanisms that don't suffer from cascading update issues, leading to constant time access and modification performance. We evaluate these representations on a workload of typical spreadsheets and spreadsheet operations, providing up to 20 % reduction in storage, and up to 50 % reduction in formula evaluation time...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to develop {{interventions}} using digital tools to improve student engagement and learning outcomes. The empirical context was an undergraduate finance course wherein digital learning and assessment interventions were important features of the course design. When designing the interventions, the development activities were underpinned by pedagogical principles based on cognitive and sociocultural learning perspectives. Special emphasis was placed on <b>integrating</b> <b>spreadsheet</b> usage into all learning and assessment activities and constructively aligning course targets, assessment tasks and learning activities with the overall goal to foster an active and engaging learning environment. In addition, rooted in a pragmatic research paradigm, the methodology utilised includes many similarities with interventionist action research, which has gained a foothold in qualitative management accounting research. This interventionist research project includes two main contributions. The first is its impact on practice by designing and developing interventions to solve complex problems in an authentic classroom setting. Consequently, six practical educational interventions are discussed in this dissertation. The second contribution is theory building, which advances our knowledge regarding the characteristics of the interventions and the process of designing and developing them. Consequently, a total of eight refereed scientific articles have been produced during this research and development project. As outlined in this study, the development of the digital formative feedback intervention, is in line with research stating that, in higher education, traditional paper-based feedback is being supplemented with and in some cases replaced by innovative use of ICT. Moreover, software algorithms can effectively provide detailed and helpful individual formative feedback to students regarding their learning processes and outcomes. This study strongly supports the claim that it is problematic to use technology to enhance learning without recognition through assessments. The digital summative assessment intervention reported is regarded as a precondition for establishing a spreadsheet user-culture in the subject, especially as it served as an ‘icebreaker’ for other learning interventions that were integrated into the course design. The intervention processes discussed have been through several iterations and their stepwise development and implementation have emerged through negotiating, compromising and resolving tension between the practitioner researcher, students and institution. The resulting compromises resolved tensions which sometimes resulted from limited physical resources. As the students valued the outcome from engaging in the digital learning and assessment interventions, they had a flexible attitude and deployed their private infrastructure (laptops) within the learning environment. Consequently, a vital part of the institution’s infrastructure was transformed from a fixed asset (number of PCs available in a data lab) to a flexible asset in the theatres. This compromise that was negotiated between the institution, the practitioner researcher and the students was essential for the digital educational interventions to work and progress. The overall theoretical research findings from this study are presented in the form of a tentative framework, which can help bridge the gap between the intervention practice and theory. A central conjecture in the framework is that tool usage that is integrated into interventions can be influential on learning activity and engagement and consequently on students’ learning outcomes. Moreover, the framework supports the notion of ICT as a mediating cultural tool that provides a new type of affordance that can extend the mind and promote an active and engaging learning environment. In particular, <b>integrating</b> a <b>spreadsheet</b> tool in learning of management accounting subjects can offer opportunities for learners to rapidly construct financial models, enable simulations using the completed models and stimulate subject reflections based on the functions of the models and their results. The practical outcome of this study has been emphasised through the development of artefacts that aim to support practitioners intending to <b>integrate</b> <b>spreadsheet</b> usage within their subject teaching and learning. By publishing and sharing the artefacts, the current research project is capable of informing future development and implementation decisions by guiding practitioners in similar pedagogical contexts...|$|R

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{minimizing}} total energy usage {{is well known}} (if not well documented), and the techniques are widely practiced. Because {{of the way in}} which energy is sold, the total cost incurred may be affected even more strongly by the time-distribution of the energy usage, than by the total quantity used. A major subject of ECM is the MANAGEMENT of this time-distribution of energy usage, with the objective of minimizing of total energy costs to the user. A software package (named ECMES, Energy Cost Management Expert System) has been developed using the Lotus Symphony <b>integrated</b> <b>spreadsheet</b> software package. The ECMES application consists (currently) of three modules offering analyses of several aspects of electrical energy cost management (plus three corresponding modules for gas costs, which are not considered further). The Symphony ECM application modules have been developed over the last few years, largely on a spare time basis, by Professor W Monteith of Massey University's Production Technology Department.

40|$|NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) has {{developed}} an integrated systems engineering approach to promote a culture of tailoring for program and project policy requirements. MSFC's culture encourages and supports tailoring, {{with an emphasis on}} risk-based decision making, for enhanced affordability and efficiency. MSFC's policy structure integrates the various Agency requirements into a single, streamlined implementation approach which serves as a "one-stop-shop" for our programs and projects to follow. The engineers gain an enhanced understanding of policy and technical expectations, as well as lesson's learned from MSFC's history of spaceflight and science missions, to enable them to make appropriate, risk-based tailoring recommendations. The tailoring approach utilizes a standard methodology to classify projects into predefined levels using selected mission and programmatic scaling factors related to risk tolerance. Policy requirements are then selectively applied and tailored, with appropriate rationale, and approved by the governing authorities, to support risk-informed decisions to achieve the desired cost and schedule efficiencies. The policy is further augmented by implementation tools and lifecycle planning aids which help promote and support the cultural shift toward more tailoring. The MSFC Customization Tool is an <b>integrated</b> <b>spreadsheet</b> that ties together everything that projects need to understand, navigate, and tailor the policy. It helps them classify their project, understand the intent of the requirements, determine their tailoring approach, and document the necessary governance approvals.

40|$|Agricultural {{production}} {{depends on}} obtaining and efficiently using the necessary resources. Producers must {{have access to}} information which {{will allow them to}} select among alternative resource inputs and farming practices. This dissertation covers research into the storage of alternative biomass energy crops and the progression into developing integrated, interactive computer based information systems which can be used to support agricultural decisions. ^ Biomass could be a significant source of energy and industrial feedstocks. Storing moist biomass between harvest and conversion can lead to degradation and loss of the material. Data on the storage characteristics of corncobs and corn silage was obtained over two seasons. The results of studies on corncob storage in outside piles indicated that up to 33 % of the available energy and 43 % of the available pentosans were lost during 18 months storage. Studies of corn silage preservation showed that 0. 5 % sulfur dioxide effectively reduced losses of water soluble sugars. The storage research indicated that integrated biomass energy systems with the conversion of silages to ethanol and utilizing crop residues for heat are feasible. ^ The development of decision support systems (DSS) and expert systems (ES) offers great potential for effective transfer of technology from researchers to farmers. A crop planning DSS was constructed on an <b>integrated</b> <b>spreadsheet</b> framework with interactive screen inputs and numerical and graphical outputs. Machinery resource and crop growth models were combined with economic analyses of the expected outcomes. The two main uses of the DSS are in comparative analyses of alternative cropping systems and sequential updating of a particular season. A crop planting ES was built with existing development tools to provide recommendations for selecting from corn and soybean planting and replanting alternatives. User inputs were combined with the rule base to infer conclusions which were based on accumulated evidence or matching the inputs with a set of combination rules. Both the DSS and ES contain data which is only valid in central Indiana. The construction of these computer systems indicated that DSS and ES can be effectively used to present information to farmers. ...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 The {{spreadsheet}} {{has become}} a common technology tool {{and is now a}} predominant form of end-user programming. Some of the same features that make spreadsheets excellent tools for ad-hoc development can introduce errors into the final product. Although a variety of research has been performed investigating methods to detect errors in spreadsheets, little has been done to investigate initial reasoning errors. The spreadsheet error taxonomy developed by Rajalingham, Chadwick, and Knight (2001) includes categories for reasoning errors that have not yet been investigated. Previous studies have categorized errors in existing spreadsheets, but have not analyzed the source of the error. This study investigates the reasoning of college students while developing spreadsheets and examines the reasoning associated with errors generated in spreadsheet development. For this study, a phenomenological qualitative design incorporated a think-aloud protocol, interviews, and recordings of spreadsheet development of three purposefully-selected students. Data sources were analyzed to determine their reasoning, the types of errors produced based on the taxonomy, and associations between reasoning and errors. The findings indicated that students used different types of reasoning in the mathematical phases of spreadsheet development than they do in the spreadsheet implementation phase. As novice spreadsheet developers, the students had significant difficulties translating problems into mathematical representations. Spreadsheet skills and concepts improved with practice through the course, but mathematical representations remained problematic. The students enjoyed using the spreadsheet as a tool for doing mathematical reasoning. Several themes emerged as the study progressed: Reasoning differences during mathematical and spreadsheet phases of development; using icons for functions affected conceptualization of the functions; copy operations were perceived as ―painting‖ rather than applying a formula to a series; and the effectiveness of the taxonomy for categorizing reasoning errors. The results suggested modifications to student learning experiences leading to more accurate <b>spreadsheet</b> development: <b>Integrate</b> <b>spreadsheets</b> into mathematics courses; increase education in <b>spreadsheet</b> development; <b>integrate</b> formal design and testing components to the spreadsheet curriculum; include spreadsheet errors in the curriculu...|$|R
40|$|An <b>integrated</b> {{computer-based}} <b>spreadsheet</b> {{was developed}} {{with data from}} 581 Red Angus-sired calves to compare synchronized AI and natural service breeding systems. This comparison was based on input costs, genetic merit of sires used for mating, and calf marketing system, using differences in net return. The <b>spreadsheet</b> <b>integrated</b> four elements into a decision summary: bull costs, AI costs, genetics merit, and marketing options. An economic sensitivity {{analysis was used to}} identify trends and key variables in the net return of each decision. Three prominent variables identified from economic analysis were bull purchase price, semen price, and percent genetic change. Bull purchase price was a primary factor in changes in net return; semen costs and genetic merit change explained rearrangements in ranking of net return. These two variables altered the ranking based on whether the estrous synchronization protocol used estrus detection or timed Al. The spreadsheet identified AI to be more cost effective than natural service when calves are marketed as finished cattle. Net revenue from AI calves was greater in all retained ownership scenarios; the weaned marketing scenario caused net return to vary by synchronization system for the combinations of costs and changes in genetic merit. However, there was a wide variance in identifying which breeding system provided the greatest benefit when calves were marketed as feeder cattle. Retaining ownership through finish and marketing either on the cash market or on a grid proved to be advantageous to AI in all of the estrous synchronization protocols provided. The economic advantage ranged from $ 142. 98 to $ 214. 16 per head compared with marketing at weaning.

40|$|Abstract. Spreadsheets {{are popular}} among users and organizations, {{becoming}} an essential data management tool. The easiness to handle spreadsheets {{associated with the}} creative freedom resulted {{in an increase in}} the volume of data available in this format. However, spreadsheets are not conceived to integrate data from distinct sources and challenges arise involving systematization of processes to reuse and combine their data. Many related initiatives address the problem of <b>integrating</b> data inside <b>spreadsheets,</b> focusing on lexical and syntactical aspects. However, the proper exploitation of the semantics related to this data is still an opportunity. In this sense, some related work propose mapping spreadsheets contents to open interoperability standards, mainly Semantic Web standards. The main limitation of such proposals is the assumption {{that it is possible to}} recognize and make explicit the schema and the semantics of spreadsheets automatically, regardless of their domain. This work differs from related work by assuming the essential role of the context – mainly the domain in which the spreadsheet was conceived – to delineate shared practices of the biology community, which establishes building patterns to be automatically recognized by our system, in a data extraction process and schema recognition.
