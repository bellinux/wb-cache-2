30|$|The {{classical}} <b>Hölder</b> {{and reverse}} <b>Hölder</b> inequalities {{play a very}} important role and have wide applications in different branches of modern mathematics. A large number of papers dealing with refinements, generalizations, and applications of the <b>Hölder</b> and reverse <b>Hölder</b> inequalities and their series analogues in different ares of mathematics have appeared. For example, Agahi et al. [13] gave generalizations of the <b>Hölder</b> and reverse <b>Hölder</b> inequalities for the pseudo-integral. Zhao et al. [14] found that the <b>Hölder</b> inequality for the pan-integral holds if the monotone measurer is subadditive.
