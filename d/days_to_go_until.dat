50|$|The Domino Day 2005 house sparrow, {{generally}} {{known as}} the domino sparrow (dominomus) was a house sparrow, Passer domesticus, that {{was shot and killed}} by a hunter from the company Duke Faunabeheer in the Frisian Expo Centre in Leeuwarden, Netherlands during preparations for Domino Day 2005 on 14 November 2005. With only four <b>days</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>until</b> Domino Day 2005, the bird flew into the building and landed on several domino bricks, eventually causing 23,000 of them (out of 4 million) to fall.

50|$|Back on {{the ship}} with five <b>days</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>until</b> Stella Island, the Doctor resumes work on the TARDIS’ {{temporal}} governor, and tests it by placing the Brigadier and Sarah in small time loops. Sarah keeps up with her exercise by doing laps around the deck; however, due to the ship’s layout, she is forced to pass through a small door near the captain’s cabin each time. She does so quietly at first, {{so as not to}} wake him, but as she becomes accustomed to her routine she becomes more careless about closing the door quietly. Meanwhile, Alex has been watching her routine, waiting for another chance to strike, and he realises that he can loosen the starboard searchlight and drop it on her head when he hears her emerge from the cabins. However, the day he chooses to act, Sarah inadvertently lets the door slam behind her on one lap, waking Hogben from his drunken stupor. On her next lap, Hogben follows her out of the cabin to shout at her for disturbing him, and when he lets the door slam shut behind him, Alex inadvertently drops the searchlight on him instead of on Sarah.|$|E
50|$|On {{his return}} to Rome, Cicero discovers Hortensius hoping to tie up the {{extortion}} court’s time until the consular elections. To fund his case and also his aedile election campaign, Cicero is obliged once more to borrow money from Terentia. At {{the first round of}} the elections, Cicero learns that Verres is bribing the voters with his immense wealth; Marcus Metellus also draws the election court as praetor. At his wit’s end, Cicero pays a visit with Tiro to Pompey’s house and a secret bargain is made. The second round of the aedile elections takes place on the Field of Mars Marcus Cicero is victorious against all the odds. His energies renewed, Cicero brings all this Sicilian witnesses to the extortion court, on 5 August in the consulship of Gnaeus Pompey Magnus and Marcus Licinius Crassus, and the trial of Gaius Verres begins. With only ten <b>days</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>until</b> the games of Pompey the Great, Cicero follows Terentia's advice and makes a short, withering speech saying he will make his case in the space of ten days and his success if confirmed when the court hears of the case of a Roman citizen, named Herennius, beheaded by Verres because he knew of the Governor's taking bribes from the pirates. On the last day, a Sicilian named Numitorius tells the story of Publius Gavius, flogged to death in public despite saying 'I am a Roman citizen' at every stroke of the lash. All that is left is to determine the fine. Verres disappears and Hortenius makes a written offer of one and a half million which Cicero and his team reject. However, Pompey pays a call to his house who orders them to accept it (it turns out Cicero had asked Pompey to ensure Glabrio, the judge of the extortion trial, remained independent) - Pompey himself does not want to be caught in the middle of a civil war between the people and the senate.|$|E
