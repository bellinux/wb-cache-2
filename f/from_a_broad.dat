5|$|A {{tropical}} depression first formed on August20 {{in the central}} Caribbean Sea <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> area of low pressure, based on weather reports from weather stations and ships in the vicinity. Moving steadily to the west-northwest towards the western Caribbean, the disturbance slowly intensified, attaining tropical storm strength by 1200UTC the next day. Prior to the Atlantic hurricane reanalysis project, however, the system was analyzed to be an open trough up until August22. The tropical storm began to move more towards {{the west in the}} Gulf of Mexico after clipping the Guanahacabibes Peninsula—the westernmost region of Cuba—late on August22.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Gladys was {{the first}} Atlantic {{hurricane}} to be observed each by the Hurricane Hunters, radar imagery, and photographs from space. The seventh named storm and fifth hurricane (including one unnamed hurricane) of the 1968 season, Gladys formed on October13 in the western Caribbean <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> disturbance related to a tropical wave. The storm moved north-northwestward, becoming a hurricane before striking Cuba on October16. Gladys later reached peak winds of 85mph (140km/h) just before making landfall near Homosassa on the western coast of Florida on October19. The hurricane crossed the state and continued northeastward, passing just east of Cape Hatteras on October20. The next day, Gladys became extratropical and was absorbed by a cold front over Nova Scotia.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Depression Two-E formed <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> area of low {{pressure}} on June 9. Six hours later the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Blanca. This system developed a good outflow, and {{reached its peak}} intensity with winds of 45mph (75km/h). However, its circulation was not well-defined and a weakening trend began, and Blanca was downgraded to a depression on June 12. It lost its closed circulation shortly thereafter and was thus declared dissipated.|$|E
5|$|George Mack, ornithologist of the National Museum of Victoria, was {{the first}} to {{classify}} the three forms melanocephalus, cruentatus and pyrrhonotus as one species, although Richard Schodde reclassified pyrrhonotus as a hybrid <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> hybrid zone in North Queensland; this area is bounded by the Burdekin, Endeavour and Norman Rivers. Breeding males of intermediate plumage, larger and scarlet-backed, or smaller and orange-backed, as well as forms that resemble one of the two parent subspecies, are all encountered within it. A molecular study published in 2008 focussing on the Cape York population found it was genetically closer to the eastern forest subspecies than to the Top End form. These birds became segregated around 0.27 million years ago, with some gene flow still with eastern birds.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Fay was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to make landfall on Bermuda since Emily in 1987. The sixth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 2014 Atlantic hurricane season, Fay evolved <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> weather disturbance several hundred miles northeast of the Lesser Antilles on October 10. Initially a subtropical cyclone with an expansive wind field and asymmetrical cloud field, the storm gradually attained tropical characteristics as it turned north, transitioning into a tropical storm early on October11. Despite being plagued by disruptive wind shear {{for most of its}} duration, Tropical Storm Fay steadily intensified. Veering toward the east, Fay briefly achieved Category 1 hurricane status while making landfall on Bermuda early on October12. Wind shear eventually took its toll on Fay, causing the hurricane to weaken to a tropical storm later that day and degenerate into an open trough early on October13.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Igor was {{the most}} {{destructive}} tropical cyclone on record to strike the Canadian island of Newfoundland, and the strongest hurricane of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season. Igor originated <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> {{area of low pressure}} that moved off the Cape Verde islands on the west coast of Africa on September6, 2010. Tracking slowly westward, it developed into a tropical depression on September8 and strengthened into a tropical storm shortly thereafter. Higher wind shear temporarily halted intensification over the following days. On September12, explosive intensification took place, and Igor reached Category4 status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. By this time, Igor had already begun a prolonged turn around the western periphery of the subtropical ridge. Peaking with winds of 155mph (250km/h), the cyclone began to enter an area unfavorable for continued strengthening, and Igor gradually weakened before brushing Bermuda as a minimal hurricane on September20. After turning northeastward, the system began an extratropical transition, which it completed shortly after striking southern Newfoundland. The remnants of Igor were later absorbed by another extratropical cyclone over the Labrador Sea on September23.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ingrid {{was one of}} two {{tropical}} cyclones, {{along with}} Hurricane Manuel, to strike Mexico within a 24‑hour period, the first such occurrence since 1958. Ingrid was the ninth named storm and second hurricane of the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season. It formed on September12 in the Gulf of Mexico <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> disturbance that also spawned Manuel in the eastern Pacific. After initially moving westward toward Veracruz, Ingrid turned northeastward away from the coast. Favorable conditions allowed it to attain hurricane status on September14, and the next day Ingrid attained peak winds of 140km/h (85mph). Subsequently, increased wind shear weakened the convection as the storm turned more to the northwest and west. On September16, Ingrid made landfall just south of La Pesca, Tamaulipas in northeastern Mexico as a strong tropical storm, and dissipated the next day. The hurricane was also the last one to form in the Gulf of Mexico until Hurricane Hermine in 2016.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Klaus was a North Atlantic {{hurricane}} {{that hit}} the Leeward Islands from the west in November of the 1984 Atlantic hurricane season. Forming <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> {{area of low pressure}} on November 5, Klaus maintained a northeast movement throughout much of its path. After making landfall on extreme eastern Puerto Rico, it passed {{to the north of the}} Leeward Islands, resulting in strong southwesterly winds and rough seas. Klaus attained hurricane status and reached peak winds of 90mph (145km/h) before becoming extratropical over cooler waters on November 13. The storm dropped heavy rainfall in Puerto Rico, causing minor flooding and light damage. Klaus caused heavy marine damage in the Leeward Islands, including wrecking at least three ships. The Virgin Islands experienced heavy damage as well.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Nicole was a {{short-lived}} and unusually asymmetric tropical cyclone that caused extensive rainfall and flooding in Jamaica during the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the sixteenth tropical cyclone and the fourteenth named storm of the season, {{as well as}} the last of a record eight tropical storms to form in September. Originating <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> monsoonal low, Nicole became a tropical depression over the northwestern Caribbean Sea on September28. It maintained an unusual structure as it tracked northeastward, with a poorly defined wind circulation and few thunderstorms near its center. Nicole approached the coast of Cuba as a weak tropical storm, losing its status as a tropical cyclone over the territory on September29. The remnants emerged over the Bahamas and eventually became absorbed by a separate extratropical system.|$|E
5|$|If {{travelling}} in a North-South direction, the Wicklow Way {{begins in}} Marlay Park, a historic demesne {{on the outskirts}} of Dublin's suburbs laid out in the late 18th century by the La Touches, a family of Huguenot merchants and bankers, and later developed as a public park. The trailhead comprises a map board, beside which is a low wall with a stone stile through which walkers pass in order to make their first step on the trail. The Way traverses the park, following a wooded shelterbelt along the Little Dargle River, before emerging on the southern side of the park onto College Road. Passing under the M50 motorway, it ascends Kilmashogue Lane and enters the forest recreation area on Kilmashogue mountain. This is the first of many forest plantations, owned by Coillte, that the Wicklow Way passes through. The tree species in this area comprise Sitka spruce, Scots pine and beech. Much of this initial section of the Way is underlain by granite. The trail circles the mountain, emerging onto open moorland near Fairy Castle. This upland heath and bog habitat is dominated by heather, purple moor grass and bog cotton and supports many bird species, including red grouse, meadow pipit and skylark. The Way crosses a saddle between Two Rock mountain and Kilmashogue before descending <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> ridge between Two Rock and Tibradden Mountain into the valley of Glencullen where it follows the R116 road to the hamlet of Boranaraltry. The road is flanked by hedgerow-bordered farmland. Ascending from Boranaraltry, the trail crests the shoulder of Prince William’s Seat, at which point the Way leaves County Dublin and enters County Wicklow. The habitat here alternates between blanket bog and upland heath. The trail descends {{to the floor of the}} Glencree valley via Curtlestown Wood where it then enters Lackan Wood and crosses the shoulder of Knockree Hill.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Kujira, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Amang, was an {{extremely}} long-lived tropical cyclone that lasted for 16days affected the island nations of Micronesia, Taiwan, and Japan in April2003, {{as well as the}} earliest typhoon in a calendar year to ever make landfall on the latter. Forming <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> area of disturbed weather as a tropical depression on April9 well removed form any landmasses, Kujira quickly intensified in its early stages, and was upgraded to a tropical storm just two days after cyclogenesis. Strengthening slowed afterwards, though the storm attained typhoon intensity on April14. Intensification continued and late on April15, Kujira reached its peak intensity with winds of 165km/h (105mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 930mbar (hPa; 27.46inHg). Following peak intensity, Kujira would begin to track northwest and oscillate in strength, cresting an additional two times in intensity. On April21, the typhoon was downgraded to tropical storm intensity and began to track erratically for several days east of Taiwan. However, on April24, Kujira would resume a northward track and begin to weaken, and on April24 was downgraded to tropical depression strength as it made landfall on Kyushu. Following landfall Kujira transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and continued to persist before these extratropical remnants crossed the International Dateline towards the end of April2003.|$|E
