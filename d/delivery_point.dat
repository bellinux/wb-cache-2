The Empress plant sits just inside the Alberta/Saskatchewan border. This is for reasons related to both politics and infrastructure. Politically, Alberta wanted value to be added inside provincial borders.

The payload vehicle moves along a fixed track when any player on the attacking team is close to it, but will stop if a defending player is nearby; should no attacker be near the vehicle, it will start to move backwards along the track. Passing specific checkpoints will extend the match time and prevent the payload from moving backwards from that point.|$|E

The Postal Service provider is then able to use electronic means to have the mail piece sorted, routed and physically produced at a site closest to the <b>delivery</b> <b>point.</b> It is a type of mail growing in popularity with some Post Office operations and individual businesses venturing into this market. In some countries, these services are available to print and deliver emails to those who are unable to receive email, such as the elderly or infirm. Services provided by Hybrid mail providers are closely related to that of mail forwarding service providers.|$|E

2500|$|A linear {{accelerator}} (linac) produces x-rays {{from the impact}} of accelerated electrons striking a high z target (usually tungsten). [...] A Linac therefore can generate x-rays of any energy, though usually 6MV photons are used. [...] With a Linac the gantry moves in space to change the delivery angle. Linear accelerator equipment can also move the patient lying on the treatment couch to change the <b>delivery</b> <b>point.</b> [...] These treatments involve using a stereotactic frame to restrict the patient's movement. The Novalis Shaped Beam Radiosurgery system and Tx Radiosurgery platform, from Brainlab, implement a frameless, non-invasive technique with X-ray imaging that {{has proven to be}} both comfortable for the patient and accurate. The Trilogy from Varian, or CyberKnife from Accuray, can also be used with non-invasive immobilization devices coupled with real-time imaging to detect any patient motion during a treatment.|$|E
2500|$|In cricket, the striker's end stumps and {{the bowling}} crease are [...] apart. The popping creases are [...] {{in front of}} the stumps and thus are [...] apart. The bowler's release point could be perhaps [...] beyond his popping crease (both {{positions}} change every over). The batsman tends to [...] "take guard" [...] or [...] "block" [...] on the popping crease, i.e. he stands [...] in front of his stumps. That nets to a typical distance of about [...] between <b>delivery</b> <b>point</b> and bat. In baseball, the pitcher's release point could be about [...] depending on his delivery style, but the batter also tends to stand back or [...] "deep" [...] in the batter's box, to maximise his time to [...] "look the ball over", up to [...] further from the pitching rubber than the point of home plate is. Thus the horizontal distance, from release of the ball by the pitcher/bowler to its arrival at the batter/batsman, is similar in both sports. However, the ball usually travels further in cricket as it normally bounces off the ground first, adding a significant vertical component to the total distance travelled.|$|E
