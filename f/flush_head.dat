50|$|The {{construction}} of the Stirling shares considerable similarity to the earlier Short Empire flying boats. The structure of the cantilever mid-mounted wing, which employed a two-spar covered by aluminium alloy sheeting that was flush-rivetted to the internal spars and ribs, was one instance of the two design's convergence. The wing housed three large self-sealing fuel tanks within the spar truss, along with a fourth non-self-sealing fuel tank within {{the leading edge of}} the wing root, which provided for a combined tankage of 2,254 gallons. Up to six ferry tanks could also be installed within the wing bomb cells in order to increase fuel capacity by a further 220 gallons. Significant attention was paid to reducing drag - all rivets were <b>flush</b> <b>headed</b> and panels joggled to avoid edges - but camouflage paint probably negated the benefit. The wing was fitted with Gouge flaps similar to those of the flying boats.|$|R

The fatigue cracks originate and initially propagate below the surfaces that are observable by optical and electron microscopy.

Careful fractographic analysis of the fracture surfaces was also done and correlated with the microscopic observations.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace Engineering. The adhesively bonded layered {{aluminum}} {{is used in}} aircraft {{structures to}} avoid knife edge situations when <b>flush</b> <b>head</b> fasteners are used with minimum gage skins. Due to the countersunk hole and adhesive bonding, stress flow becomes more complicated. Extensive knowledge of the different parameters that affect {{the behavior of the}} bonded joints with countersunk holes is essential for dependable and effective design. A 3 -D finite element model was used to estimate the location and magnitude of stress concentration under remote tension for the aforementioned problem. The influence of the various parameters on stress concentration was investigated for a counter sunk angle of 100 º. Different parameters such as ratio of young‟s modulus of adhesive to aluminum, position of adhesive layer, countersunk sunk depths, ratio of thickness to radius and ratio of width to radius have been addressed in this study. The stress flow varies significantly when the plates are filled with fasteners of different pre-tension loads. Also the effects of pre-tension loading were compared for the cases of open hole and fastener filled hole without pre-tension for bonded, monolithic and straight shank hole. The results obtained from the finite element analysis for the monolithic cases have been validated against those reported in literature...|$|E

The detection of fatigue cracks under ferromagnetic and protruding head fasteners, however, {{has been found to be}} much more difficult. For the present work, the inspection for fatigue cracks under SAE 4340 Steel Hi-Lok fasteners is explored. Modifications to the Rotating Self-Nulling Eddy Current Probe System are presented which enable the detection of fatigue cracks hidden under the protruding head of the ferromagnetic fastener. Inspection results for samples with varying length EDM notches are shown, as well as a comparison between the signature from an EDM notch and an actual fatigue crack. Finite Element Modeling is used to investigate the effect of the ferromagnetic fastener on the induced eddy current distribution in order to help explain the detection characteristics of the system. This paper will also introduce a modification to the Rotating Probe System designed specifically for the detection of deeply buried flaws in multilayer conductors. The design change incorporates a giant magnetoresistive (GMR) sensor as the pickup device to improve the low frequency performance of the probe. The flaw detection capabilities of the GMR based Self- Nulling Probe are presented along with the status of the GMR based Rotating Probe System for detection of deeply buried flaws under installed fasteners...|$|E

5000|$|Just {{prior to}} the tornado {{touching}} down eyewitness accounts recalled that an approaching thunderstorm with several intense lightning strikes turned the northwest sky a dark “black-yellow-green” color. The US Weather Bureau (predecessor of today's National Weather Service) observations that evening recorded a temperature of 78 °F (25.5 °C) with a dew point of 71 °F (21.6 °C) and a barometric pressure reading that fell to 28.89 inHg (inches of mercury) (978.32 mb). Surface map analysis showed a frontal system associated with a strong low pressure moving west across lower Michigan. At 7:30pm (00:30 UTC) the Weather Bureau’s Severe Storms Unit issued a Severe Weather Bulletin alerting {{of the threat of}} hazardous weather for southeast lower Michigan. At approximately 8:30 p.m. the tornado touched down in Mt. Morris Township north of Flushing near the intersection of Webster and Coldwater Roads. The first reported observation from the Weather Bureau’s Flint station came just minutes after the tornado touched down, [...] "…unconfirmed Tornado reported 2 mi N <b>Flushing</b> <b>heading</b> ENE possibly hitting Flint 2033 E.” It began to take a path directly east down the Coldwater Road corridor entering the residential neighborhoods of the Beecher district, a Flint suburb. Moving at approximately 35 mph (56.3 km/h) the tornado cut a path 833 yards (761.69 m) wide. At a time before severe storm and tornado warnings the residents of Beecher had almost no advanced warning other than by sighting the tornado heading towards them. Victims recalled hearing the incredible roar from the tornado and seeing its black funnel before heading for shelter in home basements. The densely populated Beecher neighborhoods took a direct hit with several single family houses being completely destroyed. Witnesses recalled that the tornado’s massive funnel resembled black smoke and was accompanied by smaller multiple vortices. Others reported seeing fireballs within the debris of the tornado. Beecher High School was heavily damaged as it was also directly hit by the tornado. The tornado’s path also came close to the North Flint Drive-in theater. Patrons evacuated the drive-in in their vehicles. Some got into vehicle crashes in the ensuing panic to flee while others inadvertently drove into the path of the tornado after leaving the theater. The theater itself received only minor damage. After leaving Beecher the tornado took an east-northeast path following just south of the Flint River where it ravaged farms causing more casualties and destruction near the rural communities of Genesee, Richfield Center and Columbiaville. The tornado stayed on the ground for 27 mi and finally dissipated north of Lapeer near Five Lakes Road in Lapeer County’s Deerfield Township. Within minutes a second tornado formed near where the original Flint-Beecher Tornado left the ground. That tornado reached F4 wind speeds and continued east through rural farm lands in Lapeer and St. Clair Counties causing more injuries and damage before moving out over Lake Huron.|$|R
