25|$|A goalkeeper {{can also}} try to {{distract}} the taker by talking to them prior to the penalty being taken. Netherlands national team goalkeeper Tim Krul used this technique during the penalty shootout in the quarter-final match of the 2014 FIFA World Cup against Costa Rica. As the Costa Rican players were preparing to take the kick, Krul told them that he <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> {{were going to put}} their penalty in order to get in their heads. This resulted in him saving two penalties and the Netherlands winning the shootout 4-3.|$|E
25|$|Dillinger {{reportedly}} became despondent after Billie was arrested. The other {{gang members}} {{tried to talk}} to him out of rescuing her, but Van Meter <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> could find bulletproof vests. That Friday morning, late at night, Dillinger and Van Meter took Warsaw, Indiana police officer Judd Pittenger hostage. They marched him at gunpoint to the police station, where they stole several more guns and bulletproof vests. After separating, Dillinger picked up Hamilton, who was recovering from the Mason City robbery. The two then traveled to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, where they visited Hamilton's sister Anna Steve.|$|E
25|$|Staff {{meetings}} to adjust command structure were nearly a daily event in Alexander's army. They created an ongoing expectation among the Hetairoi of receiving {{an important and}} powerful command, {{if only for a}} short term. At the moment of Alexander's death, all possibilities were suddenly suspended. The Hetairoi vanished with Alexander, to be replaced instantaneously by the Diadochi, men who <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> had stood, but not where they would stand now. As there had been no definite ranks or positions of Hetairoi, there were no ranks of Diadochi. They expected appointments, but without Alexander they would have to make their own.|$|E

25|$|Seven people {{survived the}} impact, {{although}} they were all injured and in shock. One of the survivors assisted two others away from the wreck, which was burning, and they all rallied a distance away from the wreck. They stated to the press afterwards {{that they were all}} apathetic and in shock, and that none of them thought about the possibilities to search for help. Also, none of them <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> were. They heard the search being carried out by helicopter and were therefore aware that they were being searched for. Two of the initial survivors later died, bringing the death toll to forty.|$|E

500|$|Other reviews {{disliked the}} lack of story or its {{presentation}} within Limbo. Justin Haywald of 1UP.com was critical of the lacking narrative, feeling that the game failed to explain {{the purpose of the}} constructed traps or rationale for how the game's world worked, and that the final act left him [...] "more confused than when [...] began". Haywald had contrasted Limbo to Braid, a similar platform game with minimalistic elements which communicates its metaphorical story to the player through in-game text. Roger Hargreaves of Metro stated that the game has [...] "very little evidence that [...] really <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> were going with the game", citing the second half, when the player is traveling through a factory-type setting and where he felt the game became more like a typical two-dimensional platform game, and led to an anticlimactic ending; Hargreaves contrasted this to more gruesome elements of the first half, such as encountering corpses of children and having to use those as part of the puzzle-solving aspects.|$|E

500|$|By the mid-1980s, the orchestra's ambitions {{had grown}} beyond {{the point where}} it could be {{sustained}} by the small town of Evergreen. The increasingly peripatetic performances at Evergreen led to the Denver Post calling them [...] "the guerilla orchestra" [...] because they never <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> would be playing next. According to Richard Zellner who served as the orchestra's Executive Director from 1982 until 2000, [...] "we were a festival {{looking for a place to}} happen." [...] In 1986, the orchestra changed its name to the National Repertory Orchestra, drew up new articles of incorporation, and accepted an offer by Keystone Resort, in Keystone, Colorado to take up residency there. The orchestra provided an entertainment draw for the resort and the resort provided room and board for the musicians, a performing tent, and marketing services, all of which allowed the orchestra to halve its expenses. In 1988, the NRO was the only American orchestra invited to perform at the Seoul Olympics and then extended its tour to Taiwan and Japan.|$|E
2500|$|In 1915, Dawson {{claimed to}} have found three {{fragments}} of a second skull (Piltdown II) at a new site about two {{miles away from the}} original finds. Woodward attempted several times to elicit the location from Dawson, but was unsuccessful. So far as is known, the site was never identified and the finds appear largely undocumented. Woodward did not present the new finds to the Society until five months after Dawson's death in August 1916 and deliberately implied that he <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>they</b> had been found. In 1921, Henry Fairfield Osborn, President of the American Museum of Natural History, examined the Piltdown and Sheffield Park finds and declared that the jaw and skull belonged together [...] "without question" [...] and that the Sheffield Park fragments [...] "...were exactly those which we should have selected to confirm the comparison with the original type." ...|$|E
