5|$|Ice rafted debris distribution: Sediment {{transported by}} ice {{does not extend}} as far East during H3/6. Hence some {{researchers}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> to suggest a European origin {{for at least some}} H3/6 clasts: America and Europe were originally adjacent to one another; hence, the rocks on each continent are difficult to distinguish, and the source is open to interpretation (Grousset et al. 2000).|$|E

5|$|Later in 2002, a {{traveling}} exhibit of costumes, props and models {{used in the}} making of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy ran for four weeks at the planetarium. This was the last public exhibition housed in the building. Up until 2007, the building has primarily served as office space and storage for exhibits that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> out of the R.O.M. while the Lee-Chin Crystal wing was under construction.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the monuments}} at Takalik Abaj {{are not in}} their {{original}} positions but rather <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> and reset at a later date, therefore the dating of monuments at the site often depends upon stylistic comparisons. An example {{is a series of}} four monuments found in a plaza in front of a Classic period platform, with {{at least two of the}} four (Altar12 and Monument23) dating to the Preclassic.|$|E
5|$|The organ is 19th-century by Bevington and {{is housed}} in a gallery at the west end that was added in the {{restoration}} in 1999 and 2000. The font dates from 1900. Outside the church, the large lychgate at {{the west of the}} churchyard dates from the early 19th century. Inside the churchyard, the gravestones <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> to the side, possibly for ease of maintenance.|$|E
50|$|Two {{additional}} species, {{the rock}} earthcreeper and the straight-billed earthcreeper, were formerly placed in this genus, but <b>have</b> now <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> to Ochetorhynchus.

The Old Port was the site of the Port of Montreal, but its shipping operations <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> to a larger site downstream, leaving the former location as a recreational and historical area maintained by Parks Canada. The new Port of Montreal is Canada's largest container port and the largest inland port on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Many {{artefacts}} {{are displayed}} at the Mutsu Memorial Museum in Tōwa-chō. This is a successor to a local museum funded by the town of Suō-Ōshima which opened in July 1970. To {{make room for a}} new road, this museum was moved in April 1994 to a new building. Since 1963, a memorial service has been held here every year on 8 June in honour of the crew. A very large portion of the bow was located at Suo-Oshima until at least 2012, but it may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> or lost.|$|E
5|$|Thutmose I was {{the first}} king who {{definitely}} {{was buried in the}} Valley of the Kings. Ineni was commissioned to dig this tomb, and presumably to build his mortuary temple. His mortuary temple has not been found, quite possibly because it was incorporated into or demolished by the construction of Hatshepsut's mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri. His tomb, however, has been identified as KV38. In it was found a yellow quartzite sarcophagus bearing the name of Thutmose I. His body, however, may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> by Thutmose III into the tomb of Hatshepsut, KV20, which also contains a sarcophagus with the name of Thutmose I on it.|$|E

50|$|Details {{surrounding}} the mission remain classified as of December 4, 2014. It {{is believed that}} Somers <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> from the hostage site before the special operators in the mission arrived there.

5|$|Dean {{later said}} {{he had tried to}} commit suicide because he feared he would break under torture and divulge {{critical}} intelligence to the North Koreans. He had been aware of the plans for Operation Chromite, and feared he would reveal the information to the North Koreans under torture. Still he remained defiant during interrogations, refusing to divulge any information and acting unafraid, sometimes laughing off threats. He was given better treatment than most UN prisoners in North Korea, as he was regularly fed and rarely subjected to interrogations after his initial capture. He tried several times to escape but failed in doing so. He may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> to Manpo when the UN forces took P'yongyang, and returned when the Chinese People's Liberation Army entered the war and forced the UN forces back.|$|E
5|$|Habitat {{protection}} and management {{is seen as}} the most important element for the conservation of Triturus newts. This includes preservation of natural water bodies, reduction of fertiliser and pesticide use, control or eradication of introduced predatory fish, and the connection of habitats through sufficiently wide corridors of uncultivated land. A network of aquatic habitats in proximity is important to sustain populations, and the creation of new breeding ponds is in general very effective as they are rapidly colonised when other habitats are nearby. In some cases, entire populations <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> when threatened by development projects, but such translocations need to be carefully planned to be successful. Strict protection of the northern crested newt in the United Kingdom has created conflicts with local development projects; at the same time, the charismatic crested newts are seen as flagship species, whose conservation also benefits a range of other amphibians.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Frank {{was elected}} to the Massachusetts House of Representatives where he served for eight years. He {{made a name for himself}} in the mid-1970s as a {{political}} defender of the Combat Zone, Boston’s notorious red light district. Neighborhoods in Frank’s district bordered the Combat Zone. As a means of dealing with crime in the area (including violence, police corruption and the infiltration by organized crime), he introduced a bill into the Massachusetts General Court that would have legalized the sex-for-hire business but kept it quarantined in a red light district, which would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> to Boston’s Financial District. The bill, which had the support of Boston’s Police Commissioner, never came up for a vote. Later, when Frank was running for Congress, opponents erroneously portrayed him as having attempted to permit red-light districts in all Bay State communities.|$|E

5|$|M-139 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} highway entirely within Berrien County in the US {{state of}} Michigan. The highway starts at US Highway12 (US12) southwest of Niles and runs through rural areas of the county to terminate at an intersection with Business Loop Interstate 94 (BL I-94) in Benton Harbor. The highway runs parallel to the St. Joseph River, crossing the river several times as it follows a set of roads previously used for US31 in the area. The highway was first designated in the 1930s as a bypass of the Benton Harbor and St. Joseph area. Its termini <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> over the years since, extending and contracting {{the length of the}} highway between Niles and Benton Harbor. M-139 now serves to provide access through the area from a set of bypasses consisting of I-94 and US31.|$|E
5|$|The Chess Olympiad was {{initially}} {{planned to take}} place from 17 to 30 September 2016. Nevertheless, the organisers have wished to change the dates of the Olympiad because of the school holidays {{and the availability of}} hotels. On February 16, FIDE announced that the dates for the Olympiad <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> to 1–14 September, while the dates for the 87th FIDE Congress to 4–14 September 2016. FIDE have also approached the organisers of the World Youth Chess Championship in Khanty Mansiysk, who were able to change their dates to 20 September–4 October 2016, in order to avoid clash of dates. On 18 February, the organisers of the Sinquefield Cup 2016 announced that the dates for their tournament had been moved to 4–16 August because of the rescheduling of the Olympiad.|$|E
5|$|Through Yorktown, NY129 is a two-lane {{residential}} street alongside the reservoir, soon making a gradual bend {{to the southeast}} into an intersection with County Route131 (CR131; Underhill Avenue), a former alignment of NY131. At the junction with CR131, NY129 turns southward, soon winding its way southeast under the lanes of the Taconic State Parkway, and back alongside the New Croton Reservoir. After crossing under the Taconic, the route then drops {{back down to the}} reservoir and passing a house reported to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> from Huntersville before it was flooded. Making several winds to the southeast, NY129 connects to the Gate House Bridge, soon running eastward through Yorktown. NY129 intersects with NY118 (Saw Mill River Road). This intersection serves as the eastern terminus of NY129, as NY118 continues east along the reservoir.|$|E

5|$|Wills Library and Keats Room: Situated in the Hodgkin Building at Guy's Campus, it was {{originally}} the main library for the Guy’s Hospital Medical School. The Wills Library was a gift in 1903 by {{the former governor of}} Guy's Hospital, the late Sir Frederick Wills and it was opened as the Medical School Library. Many books, archives and documents that were kept in the Wills Library, such as Guy's committee minute books, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> to the King's College London Archives in 2004, although the library still contains a collection of books that can be retrieved by request. The Wills Library also incorporates the Keats Room named after King's alumni John Keats, who was a medical student at Guy's Hospital.|$|E
5|$|Stela 39 is {{the broken}} {{bottom half of}} a stela that was found inside Temple 5D-86, on the east-west axis running through the East Platform from the Lost World Pyramid. The {{monument}} is sculpted {{on the front and}} back faces and was deliberately broken in ancient times and was moved inside the temple in order to save it. The front of the stela shows the bottom half of a person, who is identified as a ruler by his costume; the back features two columns of hieroglyphs. The king depicted on the stela is ChakTokIch'aakI, who governed in the 4th century AD. This king is standing over a bound captive; the bearded captive appears to be a noble since he retains his clothing. The stela celebrates an event in AD 376 and appears to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>moved</b> to the Mundo Perdido in relation to a funerary ceremony. The stela was possibly moved to the temple by king YaxNuunAyiinII to celebrate the changing of the 20-year k'atun Maya calendrical cycle in AD 771 and thereby link himself to ChakTokIch'aakI. It was placed directly over the most important of the late 4th century elite tombs. The stela continued to be worshipped in the Terminal Classic, as evidenced by the presence of polychrome ceramic offerings and incense burners.|$|E
