500|$|Michigan {{started the}} 1975 season ranked #3 in the country, {{and moved into}} the [...] #2 spot with a 23–6 win over Wisconsin in the season opener. [...] Despite being {{hampered}} by a muscle pull, Bell still rushed for 210yards in 28carries against Wisconsin. [...] After the game, Bell noted that he [...] "couldn't cut as well as (he) would have liked," [...] but he played through the injury realizing that, as a senior, [...] "the coaches expect us to show the way." [...] On being named the UPI's Midwest Back of the Week, Bell noted, [...] "It's really {{an honor to be}} recognized like that, {{but you have to have}} a lot of help out there. [...] I thought Rick Leach was just super in the game. [...] <b>He</b> <b>sure</b> didn't look like a freshman. [...] And our offensive line did the job despite having so many sophomores in there." [...] Bell's 210-yard performance against Wisconsin stood as the school record in a season opener for 28years until Chris Perry rushed for 232 yards in the 2003 season opener against Central Michigan.|$|E

The website Inverse included the February 15 segment, the second most effective from the show's second season, saying it [...] "may be the most lasting of the entire year". Furthermore, the website's Matthew Strauss wrote, [...] "Jeff shows up when you Google Image-search 'Marlboro'; he's on bus stops in Uruguay; and he's on t-shirts in Togo. Jeff is an icon. Oliver hasn't taken down Big Tobacco, but <b>he</b> <b>sure</b> didn't make them look too good." [...] In August, the Los Angeles Times named Oliver, and costume designer Mikaela Wohl, winners in the [...] "Costume designer's quietest cry for help" [...] category for the paper's 2015 Envy Awards, a parody of the annual Emmy Awards. Randee Dawn complimented both for their hard work and humor, but said Wohl's work on [...] "amazing" [...] costumes like Jeff and Russian Space Sex Gecko distracted her from using her [...] "creative energies" [...] for dressing Oliver.|$|E
500|$|Saban {{was named}} {{head coach of}} the Bills for a second time in late 1971. When he arrived, Buffalo was coming off a 1–13 season, {{although}} the team had players including running back O.J. Simpson, who had run for 742 yards and five touchdowns that year. While the Bills had a 4–9–1 record, Simpson led the NFL in rushing yards in 1972. Under Saban, Simpson continued to improve in 1973, setting a single-game rushing record with 250 yards in the season opener against the New England Patriots. He surpassed the single-season rushing record later in the year with more than 2,000 yards. Before Saban's arrival, Simpson had never rushed for more than 742 yards in a season. Simpson credited Saban with helping him reach his potential. [...] "He saved my career", Simpson said in 1973, when he was named the NFL's most valuable player. [...] "He promised me he'd give me the football and give me an offensive line, and <b>he</b> <b>sure</b> kept his word." [...] The Bills had a 9–5 record that year but came in second in the AFC East and missed the playoffs.|$|E

500|$|Listed at 5ft 10 in (1.78 m) and 160 pounds (73kg), Pierce {{was also}} among the more {{diminutive}} pitchers to enjoy great success, and is likely the smallest pitcher since the 1920s to win 200 games. Sherm Lollar, his catcher for ten years in Chicago, noted that his lack of size didn't diminish his velocity, noting, [...] "He isn't too big, but he has wonderful coordination. And <b>he</b> <b>sure</b> is pretty to watch, the way he pumps and rocks and throws. Sometimes, when I'm not catching a game, I'll just go {{off to one side}} and watch him pitch." [...] And Paul Richards noted, [...] "Pierce is a perfectionist who has achieved maximum potential out of the equipment nature gave him." [...] Pierce's size also belied his durability, as {{he was one of the}} few pitchers under [...] in height to lead the league in complete games since the 1920s, with Ned Garver, Frank Lary, Camilo Pascual and Fernando Valenzuela – all of whom were an inch taller and outweighed Pierce by at least 20 pounds – being the only other pitchers under six feet tall to lead the league more than once since the early 1930s. He remains the last pitcher to lead the AL in complete games three years in a row.|$|E

Inside Soap Kate White called AJ [...] "a world away from family man Masood", while Soaplife said AJ is [...] "not a good influence but <b>he</b> <b>sure</b> puts a smile on [...] face and a new spring in his step." [...] Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy said that AJ's influence on Masood is [...] "infectious". AJ's arrival allows people to see what Masood was like before he married Zainab, as all that was known about him to that point was his life with her. Ganatra stated: [...] "So by opening this door, you get to see what Masood was like in his childhood and as a teenager. Masood did have a naughty streak—he was in a band with his brother, and they got up to mischief. Masood [...] has been put on the straight and narrow [...] But prior to that, he was a teenager like any other—getting into trouble, and that was in cahoots with his brother AJ!" [...] Ganatra said that, as British Asians, Masood and AJ grew up going to clubs and getting into trouble with girls. Now, Masood sees AJ as somebody with [...] "no responsibilities, no children and no stress of having to provide for a family" [...] and as AJ suffers marrital problems, is feeling lonely and has no children, Ganatra said [...] "they want each other's lives, which is quite a nice dynamic to play." [...] He added that [...] "AJ would love the stability of a family life like Masood's, while Masood would love to pack his bags, get drunk and perhaps end up in a stranger's bed. I'm interested to see him bring out Masood's naughty streak—and where that could take them..." [...] AJ is accepting of Syed's homosexuality and his relationship with Christian Clarke (John Partridge).|$|E

[...] HipHop DX said it [...] "oozed mass appeal without deteriorating into sloshy mainstream". [...] Colin McQuire from Pop Matters wrote that the [...] "piano-laden groove adds the texture it needs to be a bona fide Top 40 hit, and Fiasco’s crisp broken-hearted rhymes illustrate the exact type of accessibility the track needs to gain commercial notoriety."

[...] In many reviews, Miller's self-deprecation was outweighed by critical praise for his talents in vocal phrasing, inventiveness, and musical ambition. Stephin Merritt cited Miller's [...] "swooping melodies, large vocabulary lyrics dense with idiom and metaphor," [...] and [...] "gloriously catchy hooks." [...] According to Pitchfork writer Matt LeMay, Miller [...] "had a singular way of making unexpected and counterintuitive chord changes sound downright inevitable." [...] Music journalist Kent Williams added, [...] "What marks Miller's songs as unique is his obsession with coming up with a perfect, and perfectly new chord progression. Like his hero Alex Chilton, he had a fondness for accessible pop music that had lots of moving parts under the hood. Lyrically, he was both class clown and over-achiever. He wanted words as devious and pretty as the best lyrics of Stephen Sondheim and Jerry Leiber, but shot through with almost Joycean obscurity and puckish humor." ...|$|E
2500|$|The envoy [...] Stepan Kachurka, the envoy of Marshal Ivan Konev, {{said that}} Konev {{talked about the}} events during October 1957 and sent Kachurka to Zhukov with Konev's exculpatory letter in 1970.

Ask the God for forgiveness! Pray for the sins in the church! G. Zhukov". Due to the energy movement by hand, his exclamation mark broke through the paper and [...] the disgraced commander mercilessly quipped: [...] "And that is as a print!" [...] When the envoy Stepan Kachurka back from Zhukov, the officers of state security met him and asked to follow them. One officer said to the envoy, that they have information regarding him job, the envoy's job was the search of the missing persons during the World War II. The officer bring him to Yuriy Andropov, who said to Stepan Kashira give him Konev's letter to read. It {{was too late to}} eat a letter. Kashira had not any other chois and gave the letter to read. Marshal Ivan Konev wrote in the letter that in October 1957, before the Plenum, he was summoned to a secret meeting with [...] "the insidious three": Nikita Khrushchev, Mikhail Suslov, and General of state security Ivan Serov. Marshal Ivan Konev noted also in the letter that <b>he</b> <b>sure</b> regarding the tough ultimatum, which was given to other marshals, who were [...] "invited" [...] to speak at the October Plenum, - or marshals with the three leaders, or they with Georgiy Zhukov. When the envoy Stepan Kachura back the letter to Marshal Ivan Konev, Konev read the answer Zhukov and said: Well, history will judge us. Like this phrase any Russian says, if on his opinion any other person is guilty too. Seems, Ivan Konev understood, that Zhukov was not punished and was included in the Soviet secret structures. In this case Marshal Zhukov had to keep silance regarding own new position and could not explain regarding spectacular on the October Plenum. As per Marshal Zhukov opinion, Konev was guilty.|$|E
2500|$|This was {{followed}} with a rematch, this time teaming with André the Giant. The Spoiler remained Morales most common adversary during the following months, which resulted in wins over him and his partner, Buddy Wolfe. Other wrestlers to fail their attempts were Ernie Ladd, The Sheik and Ray Stevens. To close the year, Morales defeated Tanaka individually and in tag team action, before going on to defeat Wolfe on several occasions. On December 2, 1972, he rejoined Rivera in a win. During {{the first months of}} 1973, Morales bested Mr. Fuji, Buddy Wolfe and Lonnie Mayne, as well as Hans Schmidt, Lonnie Mayne and Curtis Iaukea. He also teamed along Moonson, Bobo Brazil and Strongbow. A feud with Mayne went on to include a steel cage match. A series against Freddie Blassie concluded with three singles wins for Morales, also including a tag team contest. Throughout April and May, he successfully faced a number of recycled adversaries, including Mayne, Wolfe and Tanaka, along wins over new ones such as Don Leo Jonathan and Mike McCord. Morales also defeated Blassie twice, including a steel cage match. Throughout the summer, he performed mostly as a singles wrestler, gathering wins over Toru Tanaka, Paul Jones, Lonnie Mayne, Jonathan, McCord and George Steele facing them repeatedly in cyclical fashion. This trend was broken with the arrival of August, when Morales bested other figures including Blackjack Lanza and Stan Stasiak. During the month of September 1973, he was placed over Ib Solvang Hansen, McCord, Steele and Fuji. Morales went on to win a series against Lanza and a Texas Death Match involving Stasiak, before having Fuji serve as enhancement talent for the following weeks. On November 2, 1973, he made an appearance in AWA, winning a three-fall contst over Ray Stevens. Morales worked an angle with the then-villain Larry Hennig, besting him in singles. He followed this by entering a feud with Stasiak which featured mixed results, but concluded with him dropping the WWWF Heavyweight Championship on December 1, 1973. Morales' title run lasted 1,027 days, remaining to this date the longest reign by any Latino and the fifth longest overall. His reign was featured in independent film The Wrestler, where footage of him was shown while two characters remarked [...] "Morales... Eastern league champion. And he is young. <b>He</b> <b>sure</b> is good..." [...] as part of a discussion of dangerous adversaries that could be possible opponents for an aging wrestler. Following this, he returned in two tag team matches, before defeating Stasiak twice in three rematches. One of these matches was promoted by Sponsham wrestling and held at Roberto Clemente Coliseum. Morales remained successful as a singles wrestler, gathering wins over Fuji, Eddie Sullivan, Otto Von Heller, Johnny Rodz and Black Gordman {{during the first half of}} 1974. During the second half of the year, he bested Nikolai Volkoff and Strong Kobayashi, before exchanging results in a long-running feud against Killer Kowalski. In his final phase of this run for the promotion, Morales was victorious over Butcher Vachon, wrestling his final match on March 1, 1975.|$|E
