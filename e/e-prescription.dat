The aim of the European Union {{is to have a}} cross-border electronic healthcare system in Europe which will enable EU citizens to obtain e-Prescriptions anywhere in Europe. The Scandinavian countries are leading Europe in deploying <b>e-Prescription.</b> Electronic prescriptions were introduced in Estonia in January 2010 and by mid-2013, 95% of all prescriptions in the country were being issued electronically. Other countries which use the prescription process routinely are Norway, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Iceland, Greece, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.The European Union is pushing for more cross border health data exchange. Despite favourable attitudes towards cross border e-Prescriptions, multiple perceived barriers impede its incorporation in clinical practice. There are varying interpretations and implementations of data protection and confidentiality laws in the 27 member states. Infrastructures are not in place to support the system and stakeholders in some jurisdictions are reluctant to embrace e-health due to the high cost and the lack of security of the systems. Member states have varying degrees of health care policy, privacy enforcement and laws concerning data protection, telecommunication services and digital signature with regards to <b>e-Prescription.</b> Interoperability of different systems is only a partial solution.

To address this communication gap in the e-prescribing process, we implemented a system called Show Your Work (SYW) that appends alerts and override comments to <b>e-prescriptions</b> generated by an e-prescribing system. To assess the quantitative impact of this system, we conducted a randomized, double-blinded, controlled study to assess pharmacy callback rates and types, and to uncover any unintended consequences of the annotations. Each day, SYW output across the enterprise was turned “on” or “off” randomly for all <b>e-prescriptions.</b> A convenience sample of three pharmacies, blinded to SYW status, submitted callback logs each day. These logs were {{used to calculate the}} rate of and reason for callbacks. At the conclusion of the study, we surveyed the 50 most frequently used pharmacies in our area {{to assess the impact of}} SYW on satisfaction and communication. A total of 202 callbacks had occurred yielding a callback rate of 45 callbacks/ 1000 prescriptions for SYW “on” days and 40 callbacks/ 1000 prescriptions for “off” days (p= 0. 4). We received 38 surveys (76 % response rate) with 33 respondents commenting about SYW. Most respondents agreed (69 %) that SYW favorably impacted callbacks—especially with pediatric prescriptions (82 %). Comments suggested that SYW increased callbacks where necessary and decreased them in other situations, but did not contribute to unnecessary callbacks. These findings support the continued and potentially expanded use of SYW by e-prescribing systems to enhance communication with pharmacists...|$|R

50|$|Before issuing {{electronic}} {{prescriptions for}} controlled substances, practitioners must meet several key requirements. One, they must use a software application that conforms to regulatory standards. They {{must also be}} credentialed for two-factor authentication, utilizing two of the following potential identification factors: (1) password or {{response to a question}} whose answer is known only to the practitioner (2) unique physical information, such as fingerprint or iris scan, otherwise known as biometric data or (3) physical object such as cryptographic key or hard token. Specific security measures must also be implemented. These include the requirement that two people need to authorize each controlled-drug <b>e-prescription.</b> One person confirms that the practitioner is authorized to sign the prescription. The second person is the practitioner who confirms his identity using the two-factor authentication system described above. Every provider workflow is likely to be somewhat different. One potential workflow for renewal requests would proceed as follows. The patient calls the pharmacy to request renewal. The pharmacy sends the electronic renewal request to the prescriber’s office. The prescriber reviews and authorizes. The response is then sent electronically to the pharmacy. Staff involvement in generating prescriptions for the prescriber to sign varies by practice. The new method of dispensing allows pharmacists to submit an accurate electronic request for a renewal, decreasing the burden of phone calls on medical office staff. No major changes are expected in the new prescription workflow since the prescriber is the primary actor in the current best practice and is expected to remain so after electronic prescriptions for controlled substances is implemented.|$|E

40|$|Information {{technologies}} (ITs) {{have now}} entered the everyday workflow {{in a variety}} of healthcare providers with a certain degree of independence. This independence may be the cause of difficulty in interoperability between information systems and it can be overcome through the implementation and adoption of standards. Here we present the case of the Lombardy Region, in Italy, that has been able, in the last 10 years, to set up the Regional Social and Healthcare Information System, connecting all the healthcare providers within the region, and providing full access to clinical and health-related documents independently from the healthcare organization that generated the document itself. This goal, in a region with almost 10 millions citizens, was achieved through a twofold approach: first, the political and operative push towards the adoption of the Health Level 7 (HL 7) standard within single hospitals and, second, providing a technological infrastructure for data sharing based on interoperability specifications recognized at the regional level for messages transmitted from healthcare providers to the central domain. The adoption of such regional interoperability specifications enabled the communication among heterogeneous systems placed in different hospitals in Lombardy. Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) integration profiles which refer to HL 7 standards are adopted within hospitals for message exchange and for the definition of integration scenarios. The IHE patient administration management (PAM) profile with its different workflows is adopted for patient management, whereas the Scheduled Workflow (SWF), the Laboratory Testing Workflow (LTW), and the Ambulatory Testing Workflow (ATW) are adopted for order management. At present, the system manages 4, 700, 000 pharmacological <b>e-prescriptions,</b> and 1, 700, 000 <b>e-prescriptions</b> for laboratory exams per month. It produces, monthly, 490, 000 laboratory medical reports, 180, 000 radiology medical reports, 180, 000 first aid medical reports, and 58, 000 discharge summaries.

40|$|Introduction: Think aloud {{protocol}} {{has rarely}} {{been used as a}} method of data collection in community pharmacies. Purpose: The aim of the report is to describe how think aloud protocols were used to identify issues that arise when using e-prescribing technology in pharmacies. In this paper, we report on the benefits and challenges of using think aloud protocols in pharmacies to examine the use of e-prescribing systems. Methods: Sixteen pharmacists and pharmacy technicians were recruited from seven community pharmacies in Wisconsin. Data were collected using direct observation alongside think aloud protocol. Direct observations and think aloud protocols took place between January-February, 2011. Participants were asked to verbalize their thoughts as they process electronic prescriptions. Results: Participants identified weaknesses in e-prescribing that they had previously not conceived. This created heightened awareness for vigilance when processing <b>e-prescriptions.</b> The main challenge with using think aloud protocols was due to interruptions in the pharmacies. Also, a few participants found it challenging to remember to continue verbalizing their thought process during think aloud sessions. Conclusion: The use of think aloud protocols as method of data collection is a new way for understanding the issues related to technology use in community pharmacy practice. Think aloud protocol was beneficial in providing objective information on e-prescribing use not solely based on pharmacist’s or technician’s opinion of the technology. This method provided detailed information {{on a wide variety of}} real time challenges with e-prescribing technology use in community pharmacies.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of medication errors {{is an essential}} prerequisite for better healthcare delivery. The present study investigated prescribing errors in prescriptions from outpatient departments (OPDs) and emergency wards of two public sector hospitals in Lahore, Pakistan. A manual prescription system was followed in Hospital A. Hospital B was running a semi-computerised prescription system in the OPD and a fully computerised prescription system in the emergency ward. A total of 510 prescriptions from both departments of these two hospitals were evaluated for patient characteristics, demographics and medication errors. The data was analysed using a chi square test for comparison of errors between both the hospitals. The medical departments in OPDs of both hospitals were the highest prescribers at 45 %- 60 %. The age group receiving the most treatment in emergency wards of both the hospitals was 21 - 30 years (21 %- 24 %). A trend of omitting patient addresses and diagnoses was observed in almost all prescriptions from both of the hospitals. Nevertheless, patient information such as name, age, gender and legibility of the prescriber's signature were found in almost 100 % of the electronic-prescriptions. In addition, no prescribing error was found pertaining to drug concentrations, quantity and rate of administration in <b>e-prescriptions.</b> The total prescribing errors in the OPD and emergency ward of Hospital A {{were found to be}} 44 % and 60 %, respectively. In hospital B, the OPD had 39 % medication errors and the emergency department had 73. 5 % errors; this unexpected difference between the emergency ward and OPD of hospital B was mainly due to the inclusion of 69. 4 % omissions of route of administration in the prescriptions.

40|$|Abstract—Medication {{errors are}} {{the most common type of}} medical errors in health-care domain. The use of {{electronic}} prescribing systems (e-prescribing) have resulted in significant re-ductions in such errors. However, dealing with the heterogeneity of available information sources is still one of the main challenges of <b>e-prescription</b> systems. There already exists different sources of information addressing different aspects of pharmaceutical research (e. g. chemical, pharmacological and pharmaceutical drug data, clinical trials, approved prescription drugs, drugs activity against drug targets. etc.). Handling these dynamic pieces of information within current <b>e-prescription</b> systems without bridging the existing pharmaceutical information islands is a cumbersome task. In this paper we present semantic medical pre-scriptions which are intelligent <b>e-prescription</b> documents enriched by dynamic drug-related meta-data thereby know about their content and the possible interactions. Semantic prescriptions pro-vide an interoperable interface which helps patients, physicians, pharmacists, researchers, pharmaceutical and insurance compa-nies to collaboratively improve the quality of pharmaceutical services by facilitating the process of shared decision making. In order to showcase the applicability of semantic prescriptions we present an application called Pharmer. Pharmer employs datasets such as DBpedia, DrugBank, DailyMed and RxNorm to automatically detect the drugs in the prescriptions and to collect multidimensional data on them. We evaluate the feasibility of the Pharmer by conducting a usability evaluation and report on the quantitative and qualitative results of our survey.

The objective {{is to find a}} proper standard for electronic medical data exchange and use it for building a new data communication interface for the <b>e-prescription</b> system. This work attends to the evolution and actual situation of the national <b>e-prescription</b> system. The system is based on one central storage for e-prescriptions, however, currently it isn't being used. On basis of valid legislation, electronic prescription and drug dispense processes are analyzed. Furthermore, present central storage data interface is explored. Considering advantages, that are bound to utilization of electronic data exchange standards, main objective of this thesis is given, to design a new interface for transmission of e-prescriptions and drug dispense notifications. New interface shall adhere to standards. Czech standard DASTA and europian norm EN 13606 were examined. After all, set of specifications HL 7 (Health Level Seven) has been chosen, which suits the requirements best. Data interface design, with HL 7 standards, is based on exchange of documents. Documents (prescription, dispense notification) are expressed in the Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) format, and exchanged between applications by means of the Medical Records domain messages. The structure of wrappers, forming a message, results from common HL 7 Specification Infrastructure. Presented design has been inspired by Finnish solution eResepti.

This then enabled the construction of a framework for E-health implementation in the Libyan National Health Service (LNHS). The E-health readiness study assessed how medications were prescribed, how patients were referred, how information communication technology (ICT) was utilised in recording patient records, how healthcare staff were trained to use ICT, and how the ways in which consultations were carried out by healthcare staff. The research was done in five rural clinics and five urban medical centres and focused on the E-health readiness levels of the technology, social attitudes, engagement levels and any other needs that were apparent. Collection of the data was carried out using a mixed methods approach with qualitative interviews and quantitative questionnaires. The study indicated that any IT equipment present was not being utilised for clinical purposes and {{there was no evidence of}} any E-health technologies being employed. This implies that the maturity level of the healthcare institutions studied was at level zero in the E-health maturity model used in this thesis. In order for the LNHS to raise its maturity levels for the implementation of E-health systems, it needs to persuade LNHS staff and patients to adopt E-health systems. This can be carried out at a local level throughout the LNHS, though this will need to be coordinated at a national level through training, education and programmes to encourage compliance and providing incentives. In order to move E-health technology usage in the participating Libyan healthcare institutions from Level 0 to Level 2 in the E-health Maturity Model levels, an E-health framework was created that is based on the findings of this research study. The primary aim of the LNHS E-Health Framework is the integration of E-health services for improving the delivery of healthcare within the LNHS. To construct the framework and ensure that it was creditable and applicable, work on it was informed directly by the findings from document analysis, literature review, and expert feedback, in conjunction with the primary research findings presented in Chapter Five. When the LNHS E-Health Framework was compiled there were several things taken into consideration, such as: the abilities of healthcare staff, the needs of healthcare institutions and the existing ICT infrastructure that had been recorded in the E-readiness assessment which was carried out in the healthcare institutions (Chapter 5). The framework also provides proposals for E-health systems based on the infrastructure network that will be developed. The processes addressed are electronic health records, E-consultations, <b>E-prescriptions,</b> E-referrals and E-training. The researcher has received very positive, even enthusiastic, feedback from the LNHS and other officals, and that expect the framework to be further developed and implemented by the LNHS in the near future...|$|R
40|$|The book aims to be a {{resource}} {{for those interested in}} planning and implementing large-scale information infrastructures for novel electronic services in health care. The focus of this book is on the pivotal role of the installed base (i. e. the already existing elements of an infrastructure) for ensuing infrastructural development. The book presents rich empirical cases on the design, development and implementation of core infrastructural components (<b>e-prescription</b> and public patient-oriented web platforms) in different national settings across Europe. Therefore, this is a book in which theoretical insights and practical experiences are tightly connected. Contributions have been sourced from a network of academics that have been working on the topic for years, and who have previously collaborated and shared a common understanding of the challenges entailed in expanding information infrastructures within healthcare. The book aims to become a reference for those seeking theoretical and empirical insights for conceptualizing and steering the evolution of information infrastructures in healthcare. The two types of systems (<b>e-prescription</b> and public patient-oriented web platforms) have been selected because they are widespread across Europe, because they invite comparisons, and because they are exemplary of two different types of aims. <b>E-prescription</b> initiatives are usually seen as opportunities to improve healthcare delivery by systematic and not dramatic change. Public patient-oriented web platforms are seen as opportunities to pursue wider and more radical innovation. This book targets researchers, practitioners and students who would benefit from a book providing a comprehensive view to contemporary approaches for the design and deployment of large-scale, inter-organizational systems within healthcare...|$|E

The pro-posed approach employs WYSIWYM (What-You-See-Is-What-You-Mean) interface for integrated authoring, visualization and browsing of semantic data in medical prescriptions. The gen-erated semantic medical prescriptions serve as intelligent <b>e-prescription</b> documents enriched by drug-related meta-data thereby know about their content and the possible interactions. In an e-health system, semantic prescriptions provide an inter-operable interface which helps patients, physicians, pharmacists, researchers and pharma companies to collaboratively {{improve the quality of}} pharmaceutical services by facilitating the process of shared decision making. In order to showcase semantic prescription we develop a mobile/web application called Pharmer. Pharmer provides different views for the different personas involved in the process of e-prescribing. It employs datasets in Linked Open Drug Data (LODD) such as DBpedia, DrugBank, DailyMed and RxNorm to automatically detect the drugs in a prescription and to collect multidimensional data on them. It also supports automatic prevention of possible drug interactions in a prescription. Keywords—Semantic prescription, <b>e-prescription,</b> WYSIWYM, semantic annotation, e-health...|$|E
