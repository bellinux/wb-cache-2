25|$|The actual {{existence}} of far-reaching type-differences, of which I have described eight groups in , has <b>enabled</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> conceive the two controversial theories of neurosis as manifestations of a type-antagonism. This discovery {{brought with it}} the need {{to rise above the}} opposition and to create a theory which would do justice not merely to one or the other side, but to both equally (Jung, 1966: pars. 65-66).|$|E
25|$|Growing up in {{southern}} California, Hill was asthmatic {{as a child}} and, as a result, missed several years of school.Despite the discomfort, it made you comfortable being alone with yourself. You weren't as surrounded by your peers as everybody else your age was... In my case it meant tremendous amount of reading at an early age... I read, listened to radio... I became utterly besotted with daytime serials... it <b>enabled</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> live in an imaginary world where one is comfortable with abstract ideas, dominated by stories, narrative, and characters.|$|E

25|$|I owe {{so much to}} Brett, and teamTBB. It was Brett that {{advised me}} to turn pro, {{he told me to}} do an Ironman and he trained me to win two World Ironman Championships. Not only that, the Team {{framework}} <b>enabled</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> train with some of the best athletes in the world; to grow and develop as a person and to learn some incredibly important lessons. With the Team I reached heights that I never thought possible, and for that I am truly grateful. teamTBB is focused on helping 'development athletes' who might otherwise not have the opportunity to succeed in professional triathlon. I no longer fit into their framework, and hence {{the time has come for}} me to move on.|$|E

Then the track carries, but the second time the hook comes, it's me, and me singing it. And I open up with [...] "Schizoid Man." [...] It's a great shocker, but it's a statement too.

[...] She characterized it as, [...] "little more than piano and voice as if it is a cry from the soul". Gibson provided guest vocals for two tracks on the album.

500|$|Hosseini {{disclosed}} {{that in some}} ways, A Thousand Splendid Suns was more difficult to write than his first novel, The Kite Runner. This is partly because when he penned The Kite Runner, [...] "no one was waiting for it." [...] He also found his second novel to be more [...] "ambitious" [...] than the first due to its larger number of characters, its dual focus on Mariam and Laila, and its covering of a multi-generational-period of nearly forty-five-years. However, he stated, [...] "As I began to write, as the story picked up pace and I found myself immersed {{in the world of}} Mariam and Laila, these apprehensions vanished on their own. The developing story captured me and <b>enabled</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> tune out the background noise and get on with the business of inhabiting the world I was creating."

Zigman mentioned that there are similarities between the music he composed for Bridge to Terabithia and the film Flicka in that [...] "...at times there's a bit of a Celtic influence but not much", but he also {{went on to say that}} there was a more modern feel to the music he composed for Bridge to Terabithia. He did so as Csupó requested him to do not compose [...] "your typical Hollywood Score"; he then mixed up orchestral melody with [...] "a bit of a modern flavor." [...] The score he composed for the film is described as [...] "very large" [...] compared to his other work, and Zigman commented that [...] "Aside from the minimalist stuff and coloring that I love to do, I also like big orchestral stuff, and want to do more of that, and this film <b>enabled</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> spread my wings out a bit." [...] The official soundtrack for the film was released as Music from and Inspired by Bridge to Terabithia by Hollywood Records on February 13, 2007.|$|E

500|$|Winkelman, an ex-CBS Records {{executive}} and music promoter, {{had moved to}} the Milton Keynes area from London in 1993. He attested to a vast untapped fanbase for football in Milton Keynes—a [...] "football frenzy waiting to happen", he said. Critics of this claim pointed to the apparent lack of public interest in Milton Keynes City and the other local non-League clubs, and argued that Milton Keynes residents interested specifically in League football already had ample access with Luton, Northampton and Rushden & Diamonds all within [...] In Winkelman's own words, in a 2013 interview, he [...] "didn't have a clue about football" [...] when he was proposing to move a League club from another town—indeed looking back he said [...] "it was that naivety that <b>enabled</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go and do it." [...] He was the only person in Milton Keynes publicly associated with the project; his financial supporters, later revealed to be Asda (a subsidiary of Walmart) and IKEA, were kept strictly anonymous. According to an investigative report by Ian Pollock, published in When Saturday Comes in July 2002, neither the Milton Keynes Council press office, the editor of the Milton Keynes Citizen newspaper nor the head of Invest in MK, the council agency encouraging businesses to move to the area, could tell him who was backing the plans. Winkelman told Pollock his supporters were [...] "major business people in MK and some developers. A number of major international partners who've done this sort of thing before." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{more than}} two weeks, the clubs had agreed a fee for him, and on 16 January 2012 Cahill signed for Chelsea for what was {{believed}} to be around the region of £7million, and the negotiating of personal terms.

Opportunities like this you can't turn down." [...] He also thanked his former club and their fans, saying, [...] "This is the right move for me at the right time and I would like to thank everyone at Bolton because I've had a great four years at the football club. My spell with Wanderers has <b>enabled</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> break into the England squad, and I would particularly like to thank the fans for their support along the way.

On 5 February, Cahill made his debut for Chelsea in the 3–3 draw against Manchester United at Stamford Bridge. On 18 March 2012, he scored his first goal in a Chelsea shirt against Leicester City in the FA Cup, a 5–2 win. Cahill scored when he rose above Wes Morgan to head the ball from six yards from a Juan Mata corner, before unveiling the word's [...] "PRAY 4 MUAMBA" [...] on his inner T-shirt, in support of his former Bolton teammate Fabrice Muamba, who had collapsed in a match the day before. He scored his first league goal for the club in the following match, opening the scoring in a 2–1 away defeat to Manchester City.|$|E
