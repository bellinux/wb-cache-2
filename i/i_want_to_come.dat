500|$|Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club {{labeled the}} duet as [...] "eminently danceable paean to {{forbidden}} love". Lyrically, the couple proclaims their eternal fealty, make {{out in a}} Lexus and acknowledge {{the world that the}} romantic relationship between them is only their business. According to Billboards reviewer, in lines like [...] "you'll always be the one <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> home to" [...] and [...] "you'll always be my baby", [...] "it makes the beyond-complicated circumstances of their history impossible to ignore." [...] Stacy-Ann Ellis of Vibe magazine, wrote that the song, like the couple’s first post-makeup collaboration, [...] "Birthday Cake (Remix)", is about the history they share and [...] "refuse to let go of—it’ll irk some people". Digital Spy's Robert Copsey noted that vocally Brown does his best to achieve a Jackson impression. Robert Leedham of Drowned in Sound stated that [...] "Nobody's Business" [...] "makes you want to write a long, worthy think piece so you can come to terms with your own moral standing on it." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{critics of}} Lukashenko, {{including}} the opposition group Zubr, {{use the term}} Lukashism {{to refer to the}} political and economic system Lukashenko has implemented in Belarus. The term is also used more broadly to refer to an authoritarian ideology based on a cult of his personality and nostalgia for Soviet times among certain groups in Belarus. [...] The US Congress sought to aid the opposition groups by passing the Belarus Democracy Act of 2004 to introduce sanctions against Lukashenko's government and provide financial and other support to the opposition. Lukashenko supporters argue that his rule spared Belarus the turmoil that beset many other former Soviet countries. Lukashenko commented on the criticism of him by saying: [...] "I've been hearing these accusations for over 10years and we have got used to it. We are not going to answer them. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from the premise that the elections in Belarus are held for ourselves. I am sure that it is the Belarusian people who are the masters in our state." ...|$|E

500|$|He {{was drawn}} in the event's first heat on 19 September, {{finishing}} first {{out of three}} entered swimmers, {{with a time of}} one minute and 52.72 seconds. The time established a new Equatoguinean swimming record in the discipline. Moussambani was the sole competing swimmer after the heat's two other competitors were disqualified for false starts. He used a large amount of energy in the first 50 metres, and as his legs stiffened, his pace reduced. Officials decided against retrieving him from the pool after he was observed to sink below the water shortly before finishing and he was cheered by the crowd throughout. Overall Moussambani finished 71st (and last) out of all athletes, and did not progress into the semi-finals after finishing one minute and 2.91 seconds slower than the slowest swimmer who made the later rounds. After completing the event, he said that it was [...] "a very special moment" [...] of which he would not forget and the crowd cheering motivated him to finish: [...] "Gold medal is not everything in the Olympics. I am really happy with what happened, it was all worth it. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back next time for the 2004 games in Athens." [...] Moussambani earned admiration from {{millions of people around the}} world, received a large amount of publicity for his effort, and was given the nickname [...] "Eric the Eel" [...] by the press.|$|E

According to Lopez, the period was devastating because family is very important to her. Lopez revealed: [...] "I had to turn that into something better"; she thought: [...] "I don't want to just survive it, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out better than that." [...] Lopez didn't want to be [...] "the woman who stayed in bed for months". [...] "I knew I had to get through it. I'd dance every day, I'd work out, I'd say a little prayer and I still wouldn't feel any better. Then I'd go to bed and get up the next day and do it all again. It was a process, and it very gradually got a little easier ... I had to do it for my kids. I had to get through it for them." [...] She re-wrote parts of the verses to better relate to her experiences. The song [...] "helped lift her out of the darkness" [...] and gave her hope again.
