5000|$|The <b>five-lined</b> <b>cardinalfish,</b> Cheilodipterus quinquelineatus, is {{a species}} of marine fish in the family Apogonidae. It is {{widespread}} throughout the tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific region, Red Sea included. [...] It can reach a maximum size of 13 cm in length.|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{tropical}} coral reef fish hold station and display restricted home ranges. If artificially displaced, they {{will return to}} their home site. We questioned if marine fish are using the same mechanisms for home site detection as many freshwater fish, that is, by olfactory sensing of chemical signals deposited on the substrate by conspecific fish. Behavioral experiments were conducted on Lizard Island Research Station, Queensland, Australia, in 2001 and 2002. <b>Five-lined</b> <b>cardinalfish</b> (Cheilodipterus quinqueli-neatus) were tested in groups with split-branded cardinalfish (Apogon compressus) as a reference species and individually against Apogon leptacanthus as well as conspecifics of another reef site. The group tests showed that both species preferred artificial reef sites {{that had previously been}} occupied by conspecifics. Individual C. quinquelineatus preferred scent of conspecifics from their own reef site to that from another site. They also preferred the scent released by artificial reefs previously occupied by conspecifics of their reef site to that of similar reefs previously occupied by conspecifics of another reef site. No discrimination between species from the same reef site was obtained in experiments with individual fish. Our data suggest that cardinalfish are keeping station and are homing by use of conspecific olfactory signals.

40|$|The {{levels of}} carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{predicted}} for the oceans {{by the end of}} this century have recently been shown to impair olfactory discrimination in larval fishes. However, whether this disruption extends to olfactory-mediated behaviour in adult fishes is unknown. In many fishes, adult survival and reproduction can be critically dependent upon navigation to home sites. We tested the effects that near-future levels of CO 2 (550, 700 or 950 ppm) have on the ability of adult <b>five-lined</b> <b>cardinalfish,</b> Cheilodipterus quinquelineatus, to home to their diurnal resting sites after nocturnal feeding. Cardinalfish exposed to elevated CO 2 exhibited impaired ability to distinguish between odours of home- versus foreign-site conspecifics in pair-wise choice experiments. A displacement experiment demonstrated that fish from all CO 2 treatments displayed a 22 â€“ 31 % reduction in homing success compared with control fish when released at 200 m from home sites. While CO 2 -exposed cardinalfish released directly back onto home sites exhibited similar site fidelity to control subjects, behaviour at home sites was affected, with CO 2 -exposed fish exhibiting increased activity levels and venturing further from shelter. This study demonstrates that the potential disruption of chemosensory mechanisms in fishes due to rising CO 2 levels in the ocean extend to critical adult behaviours...|$|E
40|$|Parasitic castration, the {{specific}} blocking of host reproductive output {{by an individual}} parasite, is a host-parasite interaction common to many invertebrates, particularly crustaceans, echinoderms and molluscs. It can reduce host density, alter host population dynamics {{and the evolution of}} host life history traits. Here we show that parasitisation by a single female cymothoid isopod, Anilocra apogonae, castrates its vertebrate host, the <b>five-lined</b> <b>cardinalfish,</b> Cheilodipterus quinquelineatus. Parasitised male fish fail to mouthbrood their young. The gonads of parasitised fish are smaller and parasitised female fish have substantially fewer and smaller ova than do the gonads of unparasitised fish. As for parasitic castrators of invertebrate hosts, A. apogonae on C. quinquelineatus are uniformly dispersed amongst infested hosts (one adult female isopod per host), are site specific, and their body size is highly correlated with that of their host. These isopods are large relative to the body size of their hosts, averaging 3. 8 % of the weight of the host. Parasitised fish also weigh less and are shorter than unparasitised fish of the same age. Despite the presence of other potential hosts, A. apogonae only infests C quinquelineatus. The consistency of the ecological correlates amongst known parasitic castrators suggests that the parasitic castrator host-parasite relationship will be recognised for other parasites of vertebrates.
