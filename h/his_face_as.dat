5|$|Bueno, a Club Atlético Belgrano fan, {{is still}} {{regarded}} as an important figure within the club's fan base. A group of fans visited his mausoleum in 2011 on the 11th anniversary of his death. The team's jersey depicted <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> a tribute during the 200203 season of Argentina's Football First Division. In 2012, the club's administration decided to raise funds to build a bronze statue of the singer {{to be placed in}} Gigante de Alberdi Stadium.|$|E
25|$|The flies were bad. Little black ones. They pestered the batsmen and fieldsmen incessantly. Ranjitsinhji once {{explained}} that his dismissal in Sydney {{by saying that}} a fly got into his eye as the vital moment, which could well be true. They are an intense annoyance to a batsman, who must time his last quick flip of <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> the bowler is a few yards off delivery.|$|E
25|$|Most {{developed}} frostbite on {{the left}} side of <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> a young child. For several years thereafter, flesh rotted and infection spread, with the primitive medicine of the day unable to treat the condition. His condition worsened and Most was diagnosed with terminal cancer. As a last-gasp measure a surgeon was called in. A two-inch section of his jawbone was removed, resulting in permanent disfigurement.|$|E

25|$|Nader partook {{in these}} efforts from a dangerously close range, once having the brains and blood {{of one of}} his bodyguards {{splatter}} across <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> a cannonball fired from a Turkish gun decapitated him in a most grotesque manner. The Russians also sent some support in that they dispatched an engineer as well as a few siege guns although these did very little in progressing the battle.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, the convicted {{serial killer}} Kenneth Bianchi, {{one-half}} of the pair known as the Hillside Stranglers, sued Yronwode for 8.5 million dollars for having an image of his face depicted on a trading card; he claimed his face was his trademark. The judge dismissed the case after ruling that, if Bianchi had been using <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> a trademark when he was killing women, {{he would not have}} tried to hide it from the police.|$|E
25|$|The 5000 metres final {{was held}} {{on the final day}} of the Championships. In his second-best event, Vainio {{surprised}} the Finnish audience with a bronze medal. The tight race again culminated in the final metres with Eamonn Coghlan as the overwhelming champion. As in the 10,000 metres race, Werner Schildhauer took the silver, beating Vainio by 0.14 seconds. Vainio won his bronze medal in an extraordinary way; he flung himself in the last 5 metres and fell flat on <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> <b>As</b> a result, he beat Dmitri Dmitriyev, who was fourth, by 0.04 seconds. Vainio considers this race to be the most sentimental event in his career.|$|E

25|$|The Blob is {{vulnerable}} to attacks directed at <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> his eyes, nose, mouth, and ears {{do not have the}} same protection as the rest of his body. Dukes is also susceptible to psionic attacks and psychic manipulation, and he can be incapacitated by sensory assaults; for example, Banshee was able to render Blob unconscious solely through the use of his sonic scream. On another occasion, Sleepwalker defeated the Blob by using warp beams to wrap a steel girder around the villain, crushing his blubber and causing him great physical pain. The Hulk once took the opposite approach, harming the Blob by grabbing and stretching his flab. While he is all but invulnerable to direct kinetic attacks, such as punches, kicks or gunshots, he is susceptible to concussions and other harm resulting from sufficiently powerful impacts, as Daredevil knocked him out by luring him underneath a massive bell and then having it dropped on him with the aid of a young female mutant.|$|E
25|$|In the lair, Christine {{is forced}} to don a wedding dress. Raoul finds the lair and {{attempts}} to persuade the Phantom to spare Christine, begging him to show compassion. The Phantom refuses, and captures Raoul with the Punjab lasso. The Phantom tells Christine that he will free Raoul if she agrees {{to stay with him}} forever, but if she refuses, Raoul will die. Christine, heartbroken, tells the Phantom that it is his soul that is deformed, not <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> <b>As</b> the Phantom and Raoul both plead to her, Christine mournfully wonders what kind of life the Phantom has known. She tells the Phantom that he is not alone and kisses him, showing him compassion {{for the first time in}} his life. The Phantom, having experienced kindness at last, understands that he cannot compel Christine to love him, and sets them both free. Raoul hurries Christine out of the lair, but she returns alone to give the Phantom back his ring. The Phantom tells Christine he loves her, before she tearfully exits with Raoul. The weeping Phantom huddles on his throne and covers himself with his cloak. The mob, led by Meg, enters the lair. Meg pulls the Phantom's cloak from the throne, finding only his mask on the seat. She lifts the mask up into the light and gazes at in wonder as the curtain falls.|$|E
500|$|On October 6, 2007 Santos {{returned}} to action following {{a period of}} fifteen months of inactivity. This event {{took place in a}} fight card presented in the Madison Square Garden, against José Antonio Rivera. The contest ended in the eight round when Rivera's corner surrendered by [...] "throwing in the towel". At the moment of the fight's conclusion Rivera was receiving several combinations of punches to the face and displayed several injuries and cuts in <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> well as having his nose swollen. Prior to the decision Santos scored a knockdown which lasted until the count of eight. Following the fight Daniel noted that [...] "it was a hard fight." [...] and that Rivera was a [...] "hardy boxer with strong punches", stating that his physical condition was responsible for his resistance throughout the contest.|$|E

500|$|... "Beautiful People" [...] {{was written}} by Brown, Jean Baptiste, Benny Benassi and Alle Benassi, with the latter two also {{handling}} its production. It was recorded at The Record Plant—a studio in Los Angeles, California. Before the release of F.A.M.E., the song leaked online on January 16, 2011. The single cover was unveiled on February 2, 2011, showing Brown strapping a gas mask onto <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> he peers up at the camera. The song's title is spelled out in ransom note effect, with Brown's name graffitied onto the bottom right corner. [...] "Beautiful People" [...] was released for digital download on March 11, 2011. An extended play, featuring additional remixes of the song, was made available for download in the United Kingdom and the United States on April 19, 2011. [...] "Beautiful People" [...] was later included on Benassi's fifth studio album, Electroman (2011), as track four.|$|E
500|$|After an {{individual}} ("the gardener") {{came forward with}} information, a small pond near the Aruba Racquet Club close to the Marriott Hotel beach was partly drained between July 27 and 30, 2005. According to Jug Twitty, the gardener claimed to have seen Van der Sloot attempting to hide <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> he drove into the Racquet Club with the Kalpoe brothers on the very early morning of May 30 between 2:30a.m. and 3:00a.m. Nancy Grace described the gardener as [...] "the man whose testimony cracks the case wide open". Another person, [...] "the jogger", claimed to have seen men burying a blonde-haired woman in a landfill during the afternoon of May 30. The police had searched the landfill {{in the days following}} Holloway's disappearance. After the jogger's statements, the landfill was searched three more times; the FBI used cadaver dogs to assist in the recovery operation. The searches were fruitless.|$|E
500|$|The group spend a sleepless {{night in}} Barranca Nueva before they arrive in Turbaco. Their {{original}} {{plan was to}} continue to Cartagena the following day, but the General is informed {{that there is no}} available ship bound for Europe from the port and that his passport still has not arrived. While staying in the town, he receives a visit from General Mariano Montilla and a few other friends. The deterioration of his health becomes increasingly evident—one of his visitors describes <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> that of a dead man. In Turbaco, the General is joined by General Daniel Florencio O'Leary and receives news of ongoing political machinations: Joaquín Mosquera, appointed successor as President of Gran Colombia, has assumed power but his legitimacy is still contested by General Rafael Urdaneta. The General recalls that his [...] "dream began to fall apart on the very day it was realized".|$|E

500|$|To {{show the}} side effects Focusyn had on Bart, the animators made slight changes to <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> the episode progressed. It is first seen in the scene where Bart is reading [...] "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Pre-teens": a cheek line is added just under his eyes {{to suggest that he}} is {{starting}} to change. In another scene, Bart can be seen speed reading and later on, the animators drew him with [...] "mini-pupils". The staff discussed whether Bart's pupils would be bigger or smaller than normal while he is on the drug. The writers settled on smaller pupils and, according to Kirkland, [...] "several model sheets were going {{back and forth over the}} fax machines" [...] until the staff were satisfied with the size of Bart's pupils while influenced by the drug. In fact, psychostimulants used to treat ADHD are more likely cause pupils to become bigger (dilated).|$|E
500|$|Kennedy's wife Ethel {{stood outside}} the crush {{of people at the}} scene, seeking help. She was soon led to her husband and knelt beside him. He turned his head and seemed to {{recognize}} her. Smith promptly appeared on television and calmly asked for a doctor. Friend and journalist Pete Hamill recalled that Kennedy, as he lay dying, had [...] "a kind of sweet accepting smile on <b>his</b> <b>face,</b> <b>as</b> if he knew it would all end this way". After several minutes, medical attendants arrived and lifted Kennedy onto a stretcher, prompting him to whisper, [...] "Don't lift me..." [...] which were to become his last words. He lost consciousness shortly thereafter. Kennedy was taken a mile away to Central Receiving Hospital, where he arrived near death. One doctor slapped his face, calling, [...] "Bob, Bob", while another doctor manually massaged Kennedy's heart. After obtaining a good heartbeat, doctors handed a stethoscope to Ethel so she could hear her husband's heart beating, much to her relief.|$|E
500|$|Almost immediately, the Daddies emerged a {{controversial}} presence within Eugene's actively political atmosphere. Feminist groups condemned the band's performances as pornographic, accusing their band name and sexually charged lyricism as promotion of sexism and misogyny, claims which Perry boldly disputed, defending the controversial elements as misinterpreted satire. In what Eugene Weekly called [...] "the most hotly discussed {{topic in the}} local music scene" [...] and [...] "the Eugene flash point for the growing national debate on censorship [...] free speech", the Daddies endured a storm of controversy which nearly ended their burgeoning career. Vigilante protest groups habitually tore down or defaced the band's posters and led boycotts against venues that would book the group and even newspapers which gave them a positive review. The Daddies' concerts regularly became sites of organized picketing and, on one occasion, a bomb threat. The band members themselves were frequent recipients of hate mail, threats and physical harassment: once, Perry claimed, an irate protester threw {{a cup of hot}} coffee in <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> he was walking down the street.|$|E

500|$|Jenkins's {{descriptions}} of Widmerpool's appearance are unflattering; at school he is painted as [...] "heavily built, [...] thick lips and metal-rimmed spectacles giving <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> usual an aggrieved expression... he suspected people {{of trying to}} worm out of him important information..." [...] A few years later, he is wearing more fashionable spectacles but Jenkins notes that {{he still has a}} curiously fishlike ("piscine") countenance. [...] He has a propensity to put on weight; although barely 30, Widmerpool appears to Jenkins as portly and middle-aged. [...] At the outbreak of war in 1939, in a badly cut army uniform, he resembles a music-hall burlesque of a military officer or else [...] "a railway official of some obscure country". After the war as an MP, his [...] demeanour and shape are [...] "demanding of treatment by political cartoonists". In 1958, meeting Widmerpool (then in his mid-fifties) after some years, Jenkins is shocked by his elderly appearance. His clothes are ill-fitting through weight loss, giving him the look of a scarecrow; his grey hair is sparse and his facial flesh hangs in pouches. The final glimpse of Widmerpool, in his cult milieu, reveals him as a physical wreck, looking aged, desperate and worn out.|$|E
2500|$|In 1967 Polish artist Roman Cieslewicz {{designed}} a poster {{with the words}} [...] "Che Si" [...] (translation: 'Yes Che') emblazoned over <b>his</b> <b>face</b> <b>as</b> eyes and nose. This was later featured on the October 1967 cover of the French art magazine Opus International.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1994, Kitano was {{involved}} in a motorscooter accident and suffered injuries that caused partial paralysis of the right-side of <b>his</b> <b>face.</b> <b>As</b> reported by Dan Edwards, Kitano later said that the accident was an [...] "unconscious suicide attempt". Kitano made Kids Return in 1996, soon after his recovery.|$|E
