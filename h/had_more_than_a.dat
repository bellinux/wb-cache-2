She was assigned to the 3rd Division, Battleship Force, based in the York River, Virginia.

25|$|The Union {{building}} {{proved to}} be a location that was ideal for his crimes, both in providing victims, and in concealing the evidence of their murders. Sailors arriving in the port of Aberdeen would usually visit the Sailor's Union building soon after disembarking.

[...] Although they never <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> minute's lead, they were able {{to stay away from the}} peloton to the finish.

500|$|Association {{football}} was first codified in the 1860s {{in the south}} of England and played by teams of upper-class former public school pupils and Oxbridge graduates.

[...] The town of Blackburn in Lancashire <b>had</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> dozen active football clubs by 1877, with Blackburn Rovers, founded in 1875, generally viewed as the leading team. [...] Blackburn Olympic F.C. was founded in February 1878 when two of these clubs, Black Star and James Street, opted to merge. [...] The name was chosen by James Edmondson, the club's first treasurer, and {{is believed to have been}} inspired by the recent excavation of Olympia, site of the ancient Olympic Games. The new club's first match was a friendly played on 9 February 1878 which resulted in a 2–0 win over local team St. John's. [...] In April, the club entered its first competition, the Livesey United Cup. [...] Olympic beat St. Mark's in the final to win the tournament, and, as the competition was not held again, the club retained the trophy in perpetuity. [...] Over the next two seasons the club continued to play friendly matches and also entered the Blackburn Association Challenge Cup, a knock-out tournament open to all local clubs set up by the organisation which governed football within the town. [...] Olympic won the cup in both 1879 and 1880, after which the competition was discontinued when the Blackburn Association was absorbed into the larger Lancashire County Football Association.
