40|$|Exploitation of {{land and}} water {{resources}} has increased rapidly in North Africa during the 20 th century, paralleling regional population growth. As part of the CASSARINA Project (see Flower, 2001), the environmental status of nine wetland lakes in Morocco, Tunisia, and Egypt was evaluated. All are conservationally important habitats and several are Ramsar Sites (internationally recognized bird reserves) and several support significant fisheries. All are shallow (< 2 m in depth) but vary greatly in area. Where available, documentary information on relevant 20 th century changes is given. Survey transects for aquatic vegetation were established and used to provide baseline ecological information on the aquatic plant communities during 1997 – 1999. Unusually, one site (Tunisian Megene Chitane) supported acidophilous vegetation (some taxa being nationally rare). Aquatic macrophytes declined catastrophically at two sites during the 1990 s. Merja Bokka was drained in 1998 and, at Garaet El Ichkeul, fringing Phragmites and Scirpus spp. were lost, mainly {{as a result of}} salinity changes. Elsewhere, fringing macrophytes remain (extensively so in the Nile <b>Delta</b> <b>lakes)</b> common, despite major land reclamation and water quality problems, or are degraded by grazing (Merja Zerga). Marginal vegetation during 1997 / 98 changed markedly at Megene Chitane due to water level lowering. Documentary records indicated that throughout the 20 th century, reclamation and hydrologic modifications, mainly for agricultural purposes, affected all nine sites. The loss of lake area by reclamation is substantial for the Nile <b>Delta</b> <b>lakes</b> (Edku, Burullus and Manzala). For the western sites, some data indicate increasing salinity in the most recent decade but the <b>Delta</b> <b>lakes</b> have become generally fresher during the 20 th century, as supply of Nile water for irrigation increased. Despite intense human disturbance, many of the remaining CASSARINA sites still support regions of high aquatic diversity. Spatial scale monitoring of the larger sites for seasonal and inter-annual changes in open water area and in aquatic plant abundances is a key requirement for integrated environmental change assessment in the 21 st century...|$|R

40|$|Dissolved {{organic carbon}} (DOC) {{is a key}} {{regulator}} of aquatic ecosystems, and the primary substrate for aquatic bacteria. However, variations in function between different DOC sources are rarely studied. Arctic Mackenzie <b>Delta</b> <b>lakes</b> exhibit striking differences in DOC composition, with DOC sources ranging from C produced as a byproduct of aquatic plant (macrophyte) photosynthesis, to C derived from permafrost melting (thermokarst), and C delivered to lakes via river-water. This study assessed how variations in DOC source regulate {{the composition of the}} within-lake pool, drive bacterial metabolism and the contribution of bacterial biomass to higher trophic levels, and affect CO 2 flux from <b>Delta</b> <b>lakes.</b> DOC-specific tracers showed macrophyte-derived DOC to comprise less than 15 % of the DOC pool in macrophyte-rich lakes, despite macrophyte C levels 7 - 12 -fold greater than total DOC. However, bacterial δ 13 C indicated that bacteria preferentially incorporate DOC generated by macrophytes, while surveys and incubation experiments showed that bacterial metabolism is rapid on macrophytic DOC, with high rates of bacterial biomass production relative to respiratory loss as CO 2. Accordingly, δ 13 C, δ 15 N, and fatty acid biomarkers demonstrated that zooplankton from macrophyte-rich lakes receive a greater proportion of their biomass from bacterial organic matter than zooplankton from other lake types. At the same time, however, experiments indicated that the high pH resulting from rapid photosynthesis in macrophyte-rich lakes can decrease the rate of bacterial metabolism over the short-term, and increase CO 2 respiration at the expense of bacterial biomass production. In contrast, DOC-specific tracers indicated that thermokarst-derived DOC accumulates in lakes. Incubation experiments and in situ surveys revealed thermokarst DOC to be a relatively poor bacterial substrate, which resulted in proportionately more CO 2 respiration, relative to bacterial biomass production, than observed for other Delta DOC sources. Moreover, multi-year surveys demonstrated that thermokarst lakes exhibit high levels of CO 2 emission, despite clear undersaturation in other lakes, presumably because permafrost-derived DOC was largely respired by bacteria. Understanding the divergent roles played by the contrasting sources of DOC to <b>Delta</b> <b>lakes</b> both adds insight to the functioning of other lake regions, globally, and helps clarify the effect of climate-induced changes in DOC on northern lakes...|$|R
