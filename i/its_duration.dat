5|$|Early in <b>its</b> <b>duration,</b> Pongsona first {{affected}} Pohnpei as {{a tropical}} storm. There, it produced heavy rains and gusty winds, though little damage was reported.

5|$|Hurricane Ginger {{formed on}} September6 and lasted until October3, {{for a total}} of 27.25days. <b>Its</b> <b>duration</b> surpassed that of Hurricane Inga in 1969, which was the {{previous}} record-holder, by three days.
