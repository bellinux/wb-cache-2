[...] Arlanda is exposed to lake-effect snowfalls, where ice cold air from the {{northeast}} in combination with open water in the Baltic Sea causes heavy snowfall. During heavy snowfall at least one runway stays open but in bad weather condition there may be delays even if flight operations continue at all times. Not just runways need to be cleared, aprons and aircraft parking areas need snow clearing as well. It is an advantage {{that there are three}} runways allowing two open runways when one is cleared at lighter snowfall. The airport has a total of 250 000 m2 to clear from snow and ice, {{at the same time as}} the aircraft continue taking off and landing. During the colder half of the year Stockholm Arlanda has about 65 seasonally hired snow removal staff. Together with permanent staff, they form a team of 100 people who provide snow removal services. Special routes are planned for sweeping teams, which clear each route at intervals of 35 to 45 minutes. The sweeping teams are directed via radio from the air traffic control tower. When snow removal is completed on each runway the surface is tested by a friction vehicle which measures <b>friction</b> <b>value.</b> The airport announces the <b>friction</b> <b>value,</b> and then it is each pilot who decides whether this value is sufficient for a landing. The <b>friction</b> <b>value</b> determines how often a runway must be ploughed and treated with anti-skid agent.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} new model for {{predicting}} the speed gradient of peak <b>friction</b> <b>values</b> on asphalt pavements based on surface characteristics. The innovative feature of the proposed model is the reliable estimation of peak <b>friction</b> <b>values</b> experienced by vehicles equipped with anti-locking brake system (ABS) at a certain vehicle speed. In order to define the experimental model, several types of Dense Asphalt Concrete (DAC) surface layers, with different surface characteristics, are analyzed by in situ tests. Friction {{is measured by the}} Skiddometer BV 11 and the British Pendulum Tester whilst texture properties are measured by a laser profilometer. The Rado model is used to predict peak <b>friction</b> <b>values</b> at 3 different vehicle speeds and, by using these data, the gradient of peak <b>friction</b> <b>values</b> is determined for each pavement section. The spectral analysis of pavement profile data allows to define a texture parameter that is negatively correlated with peak friction values; this parameter is introduced in a new formulation of the speed number SP* that {{is a measure of the}} pavement macrotexture influencing peak <b>friction</b> <b>values.</b> The speed number SP* is used in the new exponential model proposed to defining the gradient of peak <b>friction</b> <b>values.</b> The obtained results show the model is highly reliable and, as it enables to identify texture characteristics to be modified in order to optimize peak <b>friction</b> <b>values,</b> it is particularly useful for the optimization of the mix design and maintenance of pavement surfaces...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—With the {{scientific}} and technological accurate trend with diminish gradually of orientation, {{it has become increasingly}} important to study the surface phenomena. When surface touch each other, contact friction is predominantly made at the summits of surface roughness and particle. The particle effect and its manifestation in friction still attracts considerable debate as to its likely causes. Analysis had been conducted to study the important contribution that the formation of friction debris can have on the progression of friction. Based on the contact mechanics and friction theory, this work establishes a new three-body friction model with considering the surface friction and deformation friction of particles. It is proposed {{in order to understand the}} effects of particles between surfaces on contact characteristics for rough surface with different particle size. The results show that the particle size and plasticity index dominates the <b>friction</b> <b>value</b> for low mean separation between rough surfaces. Beyond the critical value of mean separation, the important factor in affecting total <b>friction</b> <b>value</b> is surface friction partition of total friction. The critical value have the sequence for the different particle sizes: (d/σ) C n= 500 > (d/σ) C x= 100 > (d/σ) C x= 20 at the same ratio x/Rq.

The system was lubricated with Polyalphaolefin (PAO) at 100 °C and the contact pressure was 3 MPa. For measuring Stribeck curves, the sliding speed was controlled between 40 and 2000 mm/s. The textured area density was varied between 5 % and 30 %, with the lowest <b>friction</b> <b>values</b> found for 10 %. Aspect ratios ranging from 0. 02 to 0. 2 were investigated and for 0. 1 the lowest <b>friction</b> <b>values</b> were measured. The dimple arrangements tested were cubic, hexagonal and a random distribution for a textured area density of 10 % and an aspect ratio of 0. 1.

Material and Methods: Two types of brackets (self-ligating brackets - Smartclip, 3 M/Unitek - and conventional brackets - Gemini, 3 M/Unitek) with three (0, 5, and 10 degrees) slot angulation attached with elastomeric ligatures (TP Orthodontics) were tested. All brackets were tested with archwire 0. 019 "x 0. 025 " nickel-titanium, beta-titanium, and stainless steel (Unitek/ 3 M). The mechanical testing was performed with a universal testing machine eMIC DL 10000 (eMIC Co, Brazil). The wires were pulled from the bracket slots at a cross-head speed of 3 mm/min until 2 mm displacement. Results: Self-ligating brackets produced significantly lower <b>friction</b> <b>values</b> {{compared with those of}} conventional brackets. Frictional force resistance values were directly proportional to the increase in the bracket/ wire angulation.

Two basic approaches are adopted to representing <b>friction</b> <b>values</b> in a model; a uniform manning’s n value, and spatially distributed values based on underlying land type surfaces, and the use of appropriate <b>friction</b> <b>values</b> in these surfaces. The range of <b>friction</b> <b>values</b> in both approaches is based on literature values and are designed to represent the values typically used in modelling exercises, assuming a uniform distribution for this range. This uncertainty is also analysed in a wider Monte Carlo method, comparing other sources of uncertainty in flood modelling, including hydrological input uncertainty, DTM uncertainty and the uncertainty associated with the computational model used. 3 test cases, with different hydraulic properties are used to provide generic conclusions to the test cases. Two urban test cases with transcritical flow conditions and a river overtopping event in a rural/urban domain. The results from the model results are analysed with typical modelling evaluation techniques, such as binary flood extent comparison and depths comparison measures, as well as measures of exposure, here defined as the cost of damage associated with modelled water depths. The results demonstrate that modelling uncertainty is reduced by increasing the number of frictional surfaces in the modelling, indicating that through marginal pre-processing effort better representation of microscale hydraulics can be achieved, particularly in urban areas. Model results are also far more sensitive to uniform values, which also demonstrate an increased level of uncertainty, even in large scale modelling. The uncertainty associated with <b>friction</b> <b>values</b> though is shown to be relatively small compared to the uncertainty of the numerical scheme, and also displays significant parameter interaction...|$|R
25|$|As an option, Porsche is also {{offering}} its ceramic brake system, PCCB (Porsche Ceramic Composite Brake). The {{advantages of}} this high-tech material mean {{a reduction of}} 37lbs compared to the standard brake system, excellent fading stability owing to consistent <b>friction</b> <b>values</b> and absolute corrosion resistance. The brakes now have a diameter of 380 millimeters at the front axle and 350 millimeters at the rear.|$|R
