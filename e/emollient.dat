40|$|<b>Emollients</b> are topical agents with moisturizing, {{lubricating}} and smoothing properties. The {{most important}} action of <b>emollients</b> is restoring the disturbed epidermal barrier. This effect {{is achieved by}} various mechanisms: occlusive properties, attraction and keeping the water within the stratum corneum and supplying the physiological lipids and peptides, that lack in the disturbed epidermis. The final effects of <b>emollients</b> are reduction of inflammation, decrease of pruritus and better appearance of the skin. <b>Emollients</b> are the {{essential part of the}} therapy of many inflammatory skin diseases with disturbed epidermal barrier. They are used in the treatment of atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, keratinization disorders, chronic eczema, pruritic diseases and many other dermatoses. <b>Emollients</b> are often the adjuvant therapy, which is used together with topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors. There are several possible types of therapy: continuous, intermittent or proactive. This paper summarizes the knowledge about <b>emollients,</b> their mechanisms of action, the indications and proper way of application...|$|R

25|$|In October 1961, {{to appease}} the Tory right and dampen down an area of {{political}} controversy, Macmillan replaced Macleod as Colonial Secretary with Reginald Maudling, a much more <b>emollient</b> figure. Macleod replaced his old mentor Rab Butler as Leader of the House of Commons and Chairman of the Conservative Party organisation. There {{was something of a}} conflict of interest between these two jobs as the former, which Butler would have liked to retain, required its incumbent to retain good professional relations with the Labour Party so as to keep the Parliamentary timetable running smoothly, whereas the latter required him to play a leading role in partisan campaigning. In order that he could have a salary he was also given the sinecure post of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, a less prestigious office than the other sinecures of Lord Privy Seal or Lord President of the Council.|$|E
500|$|Aloe vera {{is used on}} facial tissues {{where it}} is {{promoted}} as a moisturiser and anti-irritant to reduce chafing of the nose. Cosmetic companies commonly add sap or other derivatives from Aloe vera to products such as makeup, tissues, moisturizers, soaps, sunscreens, incense, shaving cream, or shampoos. A review of academic literature notes that its inclusion in many hygiene products is due to its [...] "moisturizing <b>emollient</b> effect".|$|E
500|$|Dioscorides first {{recommended}} the plant 2000 years ago, against pulmonary diseases, {{and this has}} remained one of its primary uses, especially against cough. Leaf decoctions or herbal teas were used for expectoration, consumption, dry cough, bronchitis, sore throat and hemorrhoids. Leaves were also smoked against pulmonary ailments, a tradition that in America was rapidly transmitted to Native American [...] peoples. The Zuni people, however, use the plant in poultices of powdered root applied to sores, rashes and skin infections. An infusion of the root {{is also used to}} treat athlete's foot. [...] The combination of expectorant saponins and <b>emollient</b> mucilage makes the plant particularly effective for cough. All preparations meant to be drunk have to be finely filtered to eliminate the irritating hairs.|$|E
25|$|Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers {{can cause}} dry skin unless <b>emollients</b> and/or skin moisturizers {{are added to}} the formula. The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or {{eliminated}} by adding glycerin and/or other <b>emollients</b> to the formula. In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing <b>emollients</b> caused substantially less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents. Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in alcohol hand rubs rarely occur. The lower tendency to induce irritant contact dermatitis became an attraction as compared to soap and water hand washing.|$|R

50|$|In eczema it is {{generally}} best to match thicker ointments to the driest, flakiest skin. Light <b>emollients</b> such as aqueous cream may not {{have any effect on}} severely dry skin. Some common <b>emollients</b> for the relief of eczema include Oilatum, Balneum, Medi Oil, Diprobase, bath oils and aqueous cream. Sebexol, Epaderm ointment, Exederm and Eucerin lotion or cream may also be helpful with itching. Lotions or creams may be applied directly to the skin after bathing to lock in moisture. Moisturizing gloves (gloves which keep <b>emollients</b> in contact with skin on the hands) can be worn while sleeping. Generally, twice-daily applications of <b>emollients</b> work best. While creams are easy to apply, they are quickly absorbed into the skin, and therefore need frequent reapplication. Ointments, with less water content, stay on the skin for longer and need fewer applications, but they can be greasy and inconvenient.|$|R
500|$|Although edibility for C.ruber has {{not been}} officially documented, its foul smell would dissuade most people from eating it. [...] In general, stinkhorn {{mushrooms}} are considered edible when still in the egg stage, and are even considered delicacies {{in some parts of}} Europe and Asia, where they are pickled raw and sold in markets as [...] "devil's eggs". An 1854 report provides a cautionary tale to those considering consuming the mature fruit body. Dr. F. Peyre Porcher, of Charleston, South Carolina, described an account of poisoning caused by the mushroom: [...] "A young person having eaten a bit of it, after six hours suffered from a painful tension of the lower stomach, and violent convulsions. He lost the use of his speech, and fell into a state of stupor, which lasted for forty-eight hours. After taking an emetic he threw up a fragment of the mushroom, with two worms, and mucus, tinged with blood. Milk, oil, and <b>emollient</b> fomentations, were then employed with success." ...|$|E
500|$|Narcissus {{products}} {{have received a}} variety of other uses. The Roman physician Aulus Cornelius Celsus listed narcissus root in De Medicina among medical herbs, described as <b>emollient,</b> erodent, and [...] "powerful to disperse whatever has collected in any part of the body". N. tazetta bulbs were used in Turkey as a remedy for abscesses in the belief they were antiphlogistic and analgesic. Other uses include the application to wounds, strains, painful joints and various local ailments as an ointment called ‘Narcissimum’. Powdered flowers have also been used medically, as an emetic, a decongestant and for the relief of dysentery, {{in the form of a}} syrup or infusion. The French used the flowers as an antispasmodic, the Arabs the oil for baldness and also an aphrodisiac. In the eighteenth century the Irish herbal of John K’Eogh recommended pounding the roots in honey for use on burns, bruises, dislocations and freckles, and for drawing out thorns and splinters. N. tazetta bulbs have also been used for contraception, while the flowers have been recommended for hysteria and epilepsy. A homeopathic medicine made from bulbs was prescribed for bronchitis and whooping cough. In the traditional Japanese medicine of kampo, wounds were treated with narcissus root and wheat flour paste; the plant, however, does not appear in the modern kampo herb list.|$|E

2500|$|Handmade soap {{from the}} cold process also differs from industrially made soap in that an excess of fat is used, beyond that needed to consume the alkali (in a cold-pour process, this excess fat is called [...] "superfatting"), and the {{glycerol}} left in acts as a moisturizing agent. However, the glycerine also makes the soap softer and less resistant to becoming [...] "mushy" [...] if left wet. Since {{it is better to}} add too much oil and have left-over fat, than to add too much lye and have left-over lye, soap produced from the hot process also contains left-over glycerol and its concomitant pros and cons. Further addition of glycerol and processing of this soap produces glycerin soap. Superfatted soap is more skin-friendly than one without extra fat. However, if too much fat is added, it can leave a [...] "greasy" [...] feel to the skin. Sometimes, an <b>emollient</b> additive, such as jojoba oil or shea butter, is added [...] "at trace" [...] (i.e., {{the point at which the}} saponification process is sufficiently advanced that the soap has begun to thicken in the cold process method) in the belief that nearly all the lye will be spent and it will escape saponification and remain intact. In the case of hot-process soap, an <b>emollient</b> may be added after the initial oils have saponified so they remain unreacted in the finished soap. Superfatting can also be accomplished through a process known as [...] "lye discount" [...] in which the soap maker uses less alkali than required instead of adding extra fats.|$|E

40|$|Infant skin is {{different}} from adult in structure, function, and composition. Despite these differences, the skin barrier is competent at birth in healthy, full-term neonates. The primary focus {{of this paper is}} on the developing skin barrier in healthy, full-term neonates and infants. Additionally, a brief discussion of the properties of the skin barrier in premature neonates and infants with abnormal skin conditions (i. e., atopic dermatitis and eczema) is included. As infant skin continues to mature through the first years of life, it is important that skin care products (e. g., cleansers and <b>emollients)</b> are formulated appropriately. Ideally, products that are used on infants should not interfere with skin surface pH or perturb the skin barrier. For cleansers, this can be achieved by choosing the right type of surfactant, by blending surfactants, or by blending hydrophobically-modified polymers (HMPs) with surfactants to increase product mildness. Similarly, choosing the right type of oil for <b>emollients</b> is important. Unlike some vegetable oils, mineral oil is more stable and is not subject to oxidation and hydrolysis. Although <b>emollients</b> can improve the skin barrier, more studies are needed to determine the potential long-term benefits of using <b>emollients</b> on healthy, full-term neonates and infants...|$|R
