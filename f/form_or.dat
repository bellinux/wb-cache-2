5|$|Established in 1667 by the German alchemist J. J.

5|$|The fifth {{tropical}} cyclone to <b>form</b> <b>or</b> enter the central Pacific was first identified on September25 several hundred {{miles south of}} the Hawaiian Islands.

In contrast to the approximately 2°C ambient water temperature at these depths, water emerges from these vents at temperatures ranging from 60°C up to as high as 464°C. Due to the high barometric pressure at these depths, water may exist in either its liquid <b>form</b> <b>or</b> as a supercritical fluid at such temperatures.|$|E

5|$|As {{publishing}} {{began to}} change its form in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, large publishing houses pushed out small, independent booksellers. Johnson {{did not attempt to}} <b>form</b> <b>or</b> join one of these new firms. In the late 1790s and early 19th century, Johnson's business declined, particularly as his relatives, John Miles and Roland Hunter, began to take over the daily operations; Miles was uninterested in the business, and Hunter did not have Johnson's commercial sense or his ability to choose successful manuscripts. In January 1806, Johnson's premises were wracked by a second fire, destroying the building and all of his stock.|$|E
5|$|Central Pacific hurricanes {{are rare}} and on average 4 to 5 storms <b>form</b> <b>or</b> move {{in this area}} annually. As there are no large {{contiguous}} landmasses in the basin, direct hits and landfalls are rare; however, they occur occasionally, as with Hurricane Iniki in 1992, which made landfall on Hawaii, and Hurricane Ioke in 2006, which made a direct hit on Johnston Atoll.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Aristotle {{observed}} that the child does not take just any form, but is given it by the parents' seeds, which combine. These seeds thus contain <b>form,</b> <b>or</b> in modern terms information. Aristotle makes clear that he sometimes intends this third sense by giving the analogy of a woodcarving. It takes its form from wood (its material cause); the tools and carving technique used to make it (its efficient cause); and the design laid out for it (its eidos or embedded information). Aristotle further emphasises the informational nature of form by arguing that a body is compounded of elements like earth and fire, just as a word is compounded of letters in a specific order.|$|E

However, since Lichtenstein does not uses shading or contrast, the monochromatic strokes with just bold black outlines are void of certain elements of depth. Big Painting No. 6 and Yellow and Green Brushstrokes go one step further in terms of canvas size and dynamic activity that was presented earlier in Little Big Painting.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there is}} little {{evidence}} that Fielding lacked funds, or that such a lack of funds would cause him to leave Leyden to return to writing plays; Fielding eventually returned to Leyden on 22 February 1729. It is not know when or why Fielding left the school, but he produced The Temple Beau on 26 January 1730, which suggests that he returned to London by November 1729. By the time of his return, he had three plays, either still in draft <b>form</b> <b>or</b> complete: Don Quixote in England, The Wedding-Day and The Temple Beau. Of these, only The Temple Beau was accepted for the stage.|$|E

5|$|On May17, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration {{issued its}} {{seasonal}} forecast for the 2004 central Pacific season, predicting {{four or five}} tropical cyclones to <b>form</b> <b>or</b> cross into the basin. Likewise to the SMN, near average activity was expected {{largely as a result}} of a Neutral ENSO. The organization issued its experimental eastern Pacific outlook on May21, highlighting a 45 percent change of below-average activity, 45 percent chance of near-average activity, and only a 10 percent chance of above-average activity in the basin. A total of 13 to 15 named storms, 6 to 8 hurricanes, and 2 to 4 major hurricanes was forecast.|$|E
5|$|On May21, 2007, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Central Pacific Hurricane Center {{released}} its {{outlook for the}} 2007 Central Pacific hurricane season, predicting a total of 2–3 tropical cyclones to <b>form</b> <b>or</b> cross into the basin; in a typical season, 4–5 systems cross or form in the Central Pacific. A day later, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center {{released its}} seasonal prediction for the 2007 East Pacific hurricane season, predicting a total of 11–16 named storms, 6–9 hurricanes, and 2–4 major hurricanes. Below-average activity was expected {{as a result of}} either ENSO-Neutral or La Niña conditions, as well as the continuation of the reduction in activity beginning in 1995.|$|E
