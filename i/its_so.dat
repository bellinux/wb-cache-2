60|$|In {{a secluded}} and mountainous part of Stiria {{there was in}} old time a valley of the most {{surprising}} and luxuriant fertility. It was surrounded on all sides by steep and rocky mountains rising into peaks which were always covered with snow and from which a number of torrents descended in constant cataracts. One of these fell westward over {{the face of a}} crag so high that when the sun had set to everything else, and all below was darkness, his beams still shone full upon this waterfall, so that it looked like a shower of gold. It was therefore called by the people of the neighborhood the Golden River. It was strange that none of these streams fell into the valley itself. They all descended {{on the other side of}} the mountains and wound away through broad plains and by populous cities. But the clouds were drawn so constantly to the snowy hills, and rested so softly in the circular hollow, that in time of drought and heat, when all the country round was burned up, there was still rain in the little valley; and <b>its</b> crops were <b>so</b> heavy, and <b>its</b> hay <b>so</b> high, and <b>its</b> apples <b>so</b> red, and <b>its</b> grapes <b>so</b> blue, and <b>its</b> wine <b>so</b> rich, and <b>its</b> honey <b>so</b> sweet, that it was a marvel to everyone who beheld it and was commonly called the Treasure Valley.|$|R

60|$|A {{consultation}} {{was held}} that night, between Gardiner, his officers, {{and the oldest}} of the seamen. The question presented was whether the party should attempt to quit the group in the boats, or whether they should build a little on the hulk, deck her over, and make use of this altered craft, to return to the northward. There was a good deal to be said on both sides. If the boats were used, the party might leave as soon as the weather became settled, and the season a little more advanced, by dragging the boats on sledges across the ice to the open water, which was supposed to be some ten or twenty miles to the northward, and a large amount of provisions might thus be saved. On the other hand, however, as it regarded the provisions, the boats would hold so little, that no great gain would be made by going early in them, and leaving a sufficient supply behind to keep all hands two or three months. This was a consideration that presented itself, and it had its weight in the decision. Then there was the chance of the winter's returning, bringing with it the absolute necessity of using a great deal more fuel. This was {{a matter of life and}} death. Comparatively pleasant as the weather had become, there was no security for <b>its</b> <b>so</b> continuing. One entire spring month was before the sealers, and a shift of wind might convert the weather into a wintry temperature. Should such be the case, it might become indispensable to burn the very materials that would be required to build up and deck over the hulk. There were, therefore, many things to be taken into the account; nor was the question settled without a great deal of debate and reflection.|$|E
6000|$|The {{improvements}} {{which have}} taken place during recent years in ocean-going steamships have been great and rapid. The speed attained by some of these magnificent vessels is little short of marvellous. Many persons still living can recollect {{the time when the}} voyage to Australia in a sailing vessel lasted six months. What is now the state of matters? By more than one line of steamships the traveller may reach Sydney or Melbourne within forty days. A recent voyage of the Orient, one of the latest and finest additions to ocean steamships, merits more than a passing notice. The Lusitania, which belongs to the same line, steamed from England to Australia in less than forty days, and the feat was regarded as a great one. But the Lusitania has been far outmatched by her sister-ship the Orient, which has actually accomplished the same voyage in thirty-five days, fifteen hours, and forty-six minutes. From Plymouth to the Cape of Good Hope took the Orient only seventeen days twenty-one hours. This is the fastest speed on record. Whether it is the maximum rate possible to ocean steamships, or whether it is destined to be surpassed by a still higher degree of speed, remains to be seen. Many persons are of opinion that the increased facilities of speed which are now within reach of travellers on long voyages will gradually lead to the total disuse of sailing ships for passenger traffic. It may be so, but there are still not a few who would prefer a sailing to a steam ship for a long sea voyage, notwithstanding <b>its</b> <b>so</b> greatly inferior rate of speed. But nowadays everything must be sacrificed to time. [...] "Time flies," [...] is at present the motto of most instant and potent power with the world; but the day is perhaps not far off when the fiat, [...] "Thus far, and no farther," [...] must be pronounced not only on the speed of steamships, but on the breathless rush and hurry of the age in general.|$|E
