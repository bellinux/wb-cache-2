Hsu stated that [...] "I knew what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> illegal" [...] and faced up to 20 years in prison on each count. Hsu was still contesting the charges of campaign finance fraud, however.|$|E

2500|$|After his arrest, Josef Fritzl {{claimed that}} his {{behavior}} toward his daughter did not constitute rape but was consensual. His defence lawyer Rudolf Mayer forwarded extracts from {{the minutes of}} his talks with his client to the Austrian weekly News for publication. According to these statements, Fritzl said that he [...] "always knew during the whole 24 years that what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> not right, that I must have been crazy to do such a thing, yet it became a normal occurrence to lead a second life {{in the basement of}} my house." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1984, he {{was cast}} as Angela Channing's (Jane Wyman) lawyer Greg Reardon in {{the soap opera}} Falcon Crest, without {{requiring}} an audition. MacCorkindale asked for the character, originally an American named Brad, to be rewritten as English, and also directed one episode. He rejected a contract extension after appearing in 59 episodes and left the series in 1986 because he [...] "felt that the work <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> fun and lucrative but not as stretching as I felt I wanted or needed. I also was finding fault {{with much of the}} work, not only Falcon Crest, but everything. I was actually ready to quit acting and try producing so I could put myself on the line." ...|$|E
2500|$|Young {{was awarded}} the NFL Rookie of the Year honors for 2006. In spite of this, Young {{considered}} ending his career. In an article published by NFL.com Young {{was quoted as saying}} he thought about retiring from professional football after his first season stating [...] "I really thought long and hard about it. There was so much going on with my family. It was crazy being an NFL quarterback. It wasn't fun anymore. All of the fun was out of it. All of the excitement was gone. All <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> worrying about things." [...] However, Young would later recant this stating he never considered quitting football and his remarks were blown out of proportion.|$|E

60|$|In {{the first}} weeks the days were long; they often, at their finest, gave me what I used to call my own hour, the hour when, for my pupils, teatime and bedtime having come and gone, I had, before my final retirement, a small {{interval}} alone. Much as I liked my companions, this hour was the thing in the day I liked most; and I liked it best of all when, as the light faded--or rather, I should say, the day lingered and the last calls of the last birds sounded, in a flushed sky, from the old trees--I could take a turn into the grounds and enjoy, almost {{with a sense of}} property that amused and flattered me, the beauty and dignity of the place. It was a pleasure at these moments to feel myself tranquil and justified; doubtless, perhaps, also to reflect that by my discretion, my quiet good sense and general high propriety, I was giving pleasure--if he ever thought of it!--to the person to whose pressure I had responded. What <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> what he had earnestly hoped and directly asked of me, and that I COULD, after all, do it proved even a greater joy than I had expected. I daresay I fancied myself, in short, a remarkable young woman and took comfort in the faith that this would more publicly appear. Well, I needed to be remarkable to offer a front to the remarkable things that presently gave their first sign.|$|E

Miss Stacy caught me reading Ben Hur in school yesterday afternoon when I should have been studying my Canadian history. Jane Andrews lent it to me. I was reading it at dinner hour, and I had just got to the chariot race when school went in. I was simply wild to know how it turned out--although I felt sure Ben Hur must win, because it wouldn't be poetical justice if he didn't--so I spread the history open on my desk lid and then tucked Ben Hur between the desk and my knee. I just looked as if I were studying Canadian history, you know, while all the while I was reveling in Ben Hur. I was so interested in it that I never noticed Miss Stacy coming down the aisle until all at once I just looked up and there she was looking down at me, so reproachful-like. I can't tell you how ashamed I felt, Marilla, especially when I heard Josie Pye giggling. Miss Stacy took Ben Hur away, but she never said a word then. She kept me in at recess and talked to me. She said I had done very wrong in two respects. First, I was wasting the time I ought to have put on my studies; and secondly, I was deceiving my teacher in trying to make it appear I was reading a history when it was a storybook instead. I had never realized until that moment, Marilla, that what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> deceitful. I was shocked. I cried bitterly, and asked Miss Stacy to forgive me and I'd never do such a thing again; and I offered to do penance by never so much as looking at Ben Hur for a whole week, not even to see how the chariot race turned out. But Miss Stacy said she wouldn't require that, and she forgave me freely. So I think it wasn't very kind of her to come up here to you about it after all." ...|$|E

500|$|Regarding his {{personal}} life, Paul Oscar has said: [...] "I {{have a lot}} of work still to do. I have had three relationships that, from the outside, looked picture perfect, I suppose.

60|$|And so my {{connection}} was dissolved {{with the department}} to which I had applied the thirty-three best years of my life;--I must not say devoted, for devotion implies an entire surrender, and I certainly had found time for other occupations. It is however absolutely true that during all those years I had thought very much more about the Post Office than I had of my literary work, and had given to it a more unflagging attention. Up to this time I had never been angry, never felt myself injured or unappreciated in that my literary efforts were slighted. But I had suffered very much bitterness on that score {{in reference to the}} Post Office; and I had suffered not only on my own personal behalf, but also and more bitterly when I could not promise to be done the things which I thought ought to be done for the benefit of others. That the public in little villages should be enabled to buy postage stamps; that they should have their letters delivered free and at an early hour; that pillar letter-boxes should be put up for them (of which accommodation in the streets and ways of England I was the originator, having, however, got the authority for the erection of the first at St. Heliers in Jersey); that the letter-carriers and sorters should not be overworked; that they should be adequately paid, and have some hours to themselves, especially on Sundays; above all, that they should be made to earn their wages and latterly that they should not be crushed by what I thought to be the damnable system of so-called merit;--these were the matters by which I was stirred to what the secretary was pleased to call energetic performance of my duties. How I loved, when I was contradicted,--as I was very often and, no doubt, very properly,--to do instantly as I was bid, and then to prove that what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> fatuous, dishonest, expensive, and impracticable! And then there were feuds--such delicious feuds! I was always an anti-Hillite, acknowledging, indeed, the great thing which Sir Rowland Hill had done for the country, but believing him to be entirely unfit to manage men or to arrange labour. It was a pleasure to me to differ from him on all occasions;--and, looking back now, I think that in all such differences I was right.|$|E

40|$|Because of {{the growing}} numbers of {{foreign-born}} technical profes-sionals in American industry, the need for appropriate on-site instruction in the English of Science and Technology (EST) is becoming urgent. However, what the working professional needs from a course in writing EST differs markedly from what the university student in a technical degree program needs. This article identifies {{the most important of}} these differences and their implications for course design and materials development. It also argues that recent research on the dynamics of reading technical English can be used to inform the teaching of the technical writing skills that non-native speakers of English require in industry settings.
