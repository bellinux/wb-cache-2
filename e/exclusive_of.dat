5|$|Herodotus recounts that, {{according}} to the Athenians, as the battle began the Corinthians hoisted their sails and began sailing away from the battle, northwards up the straits.

If this did in fact occur, one possible interpretation is that these ships had been a decoy sent to reconnoitre the northern exit from the straits, in case the arrival of the encircling Egyptian detachment was imminent (if indeed this also occurred). Another possibility (not <b>exclusive</b> <b>of</b> the former) is that the departure of the Corinthians triggered the final approach of the Persians, suggesting as it did that the Allied fleet was disintegrating.

Japanese sources universally give the date for Hieis keel-laying as 24 September 1875—the same as that for the awarding of the contract—but historian Hans Langerer describes this as improbable, arguing that no shipyard would order enough material to begin construction without cash in hand. She was launched on 12 June 1877; Reed's daughter smashed a bottle of champagne on the ship's bow in the traditional Western style. The ship was named for Mount Hiei. Completed in February 1878, Hiei sailed for Japan on 22 March under the command of a British captain and with a British crew because the IJN was not yet ready for such a long voyage. One of the passengers aboard her was the future admiral Togo Heihachiro, who had just completed six years of study in the United Kingdom. She arrived in Yokohama on 22 May and was assigned to the Tokai Naval District a month later. On 10 July a formal ceremony was held in Yokohama for the receipt of the ship that was attended by the Meiji Emperor and many senior government officials. The ship was opened for tours by the nobility, their families and invited guests for three days after the ceremony. On 14 July, the general public was allowed to tour the ship for a week.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Despite the {{importance}} of multiple psychosocial factors on nutrition-related behavior, very few studies have explored beyond the role of mothers’ knowledge and perception of child-focused outcomes on the duration <b>of</b> <b>exclusive</b> breastfeeding in Africa. Our objective {{was to determine the}} relationships among mothers’ knowledge, outcome expectancies, normative beliefs, and cessation <b>of</b> <b>exclusive</b> breastfeeding in rural Kenya. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 400 mothers of children, 0 - 24 months old, in rural Kenya. Early child-feeding practices, knowledge of breastfeeding recommendations, beliefs associated with impact <b>of</b> <b>exclusive</b> breastfeeding on child- and mother-focused outcomes and perception <b>of</b> acceptability <b>of</b> <b>exclusive</b> breastfeeding by important others were examined. Cox regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between independent variables of interest and cessation <b>of</b> <b>exclusive</b> breastfeeding. Results Being knowledgeable of breastfeeding-related recommendations, positive beliefs on the impact <b>of</b> <b>exclusive</b> breastfeeding on child- focused outcomes, having a more positive perception of the impact <b>of</b> <b>exclusive</b> breastfeeding on mother-focused outcomes and a more positive perception <b>of</b> acceptability <b>of</b> <b>exclusive</b> breastfeeding by important others were associated with significantly lower risks of premature cessation <b>of</b> <b>exclusive</b> breastfeeding. Conclusion In addition to knowledge levels, mothers’ beliefs {{play an important role in}} mothers’ decisions to practice exclusive breastfeeding. Mother’s beliefs on the impact <b>of</b> <b>exclusive</b> breastfeeding on the mother’s health, physical appearance and ability to engage in other activities were shown to have the strongest relationship with premature cessation <b>of</b> <b>exclusive</b> breastfeeding. Addressing these beliefs has the potential to contribute to more effective exclusive breastfeeding promotion efforts in rural Kenya...|$|R
