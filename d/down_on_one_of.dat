2500|$|Mayhew {{learned of}} a casting call for Star Wars, which was filming in London, {{and decided to}} audition. The [...] tall actor was {{immediately}} cast as Chewbacca after he stood up to greet Lucas. He said, [...] "I sat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the sofas, waiting for George. Door opened, and George walked in with Gary behind him. So, naturally, what did I do? I'm raised in England. Soon as someone comes in through the door, I stand up. George goes 'Hmm [...]' Virtually turned to Gary, and said 'I think we've found him. He was actually eligible for {{either of the two}} roles: Chewbacca or Darth Vader. He chose the former because he wanted to play a hero; British actor David Prowse took the other. Mayhew modeled his performance of Chewbacca after the mannerisms of animals he saw at public zoos.|$|E

5000|$|Figure-8 swing: Like a 1-arm swing, but {{the bell}} goes <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> side <b>of</b> the body, {{switching}} hands and {{up through the}} legs, and then down the other side.|$|R
60|$|Her colour {{deepening}} by the exertion, {{he suggested}} that she should sit <b>down</b> again <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the mossy boulders by the wayside. Nothing loth she did, De Stancy standing by, and with his cane scratching the moss from the stone.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{came to see}} you, Bear. My poor Bear! I am so sorry!' said Cherry, sitting <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the beds; 'how {{could you}} go on so?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “That’s true,” {{answered}} Dave. He had {{not forgotten}} the big turtle the old tar {{had managed to}} catch <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the islands in the South Seas.|$|E
6000|$|At last he said: [...] "You know, I'm simply dead. I don't think I {{can absorb}} {{anything}} more profitably. Let's go and sit <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the benches." ...|$|E
60|$|The little barber {{scratched}} his head, and shook it, {{and looked at}} the teapot, and gradually got out of the room. John Westlock, taking a chair, sat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> side <b>of</b> Mrs Gamp. Martin, taking the foot of the bed, supported her on the other.|$|R
60|$|Beresteyn did {{not choose}} to notice the impertinent tone which rang through the other man's speech. Without wasting further words, he took a purse from his wallet, and sitting <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> corner <b>of</b> the model's platform, he emptied the {{contents}} of the purse upon it.|$|R
60|$|Rollo sat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> side <b>of</b> the sand-garden, and Nathan on the other, {{and both}} busied {{themselves}} in digging and building little houses.

60|$|Hare unbuckled his cartridge-belt, {{which held}} his Colt, {{and hung it}} over the pommel of his saddle; then he sat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the stone seats near the camp-fire.|$|E
60|$|Kells sat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the box seats, and {{his heavy}} gun-sheath rested upon the floor. He looked at Joan now, forgetting {{she was a}} woman and his prisoner.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is a fine}} prospect, truly," [...] remarked Fred, as he sank <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the stools. [...] "I {{wonder how}} long we'll {{have to stay in}} this hole." ...|$|E
6000|$|As Quentin {{turned his}} face towards her, to return the fitting acknowledgments, she saw the blood which {{streamed}} <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> side <b>of</b> his face, and exclaimed, {{in a tone of}} deep feeling, [...] "Holy Virgin, he is wounded! he bleeds!--Dismount, sir, and let your wound be bound!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The man sat <b>down</b> heavily <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{the chairs}} while {{the little boy}} lit the lamp.

6000|$|... "And is {{that what}} you called me downstairs for?" [...] cried the {{proprietor}} of the restaurant, in a rage. [...] "Make me throw down a good hand at cards just to look at a lot of tin knives and forks! You peddlers are getting more bold every day.

6000|$|... "The {{girls will}} be here directly, M. Lacordaire; pray get up. I can talk to you much better if you will stand up, or sit <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> these stones." ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{paced the}} {{remainder}} of their spiral pathway in silence, and having at last reached the summit, Lord Mountclere sank <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the steps, panting out, 'Dear me, dear me!' ...|$|E
60|$|Parkhurst ran {{his boat}} {{close to the}} bridge, and Ralph sprang <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the seats. Soon the two were moving down Silver Lake at all the speed the little craft commanded.|$|E

60|$|It was a {{good while}} before the coffee was ready, but at last it was made, and Sylvia carried it to our patient in a great bowl. She sat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> side <b>of</b> the bed to {{administer}} the smoking beverage with a spoon, while I sat {{on the other side}} and raised the old man's head that he might drink the better. After swallowing the first tablespoonful, the patient winked.|$|R
6000|$|... "Row easy, men," [...] Mr. Ferguson said, {{as he sat}} <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> side <b>of</b> the coxswain, while Dick {{took his}} place on the other. [...] "Drop quietly down the river.

60|$|He was {{so tired}} that he could sleep anywhere, and walked across the track to the waiting shed, where he laid <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the benches, glad of an {{opportunity}} to rest his weary limbs.|$|E
60|$|My uncle {{would not}} own he did not, but his curiosity was manifest. My mother sat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the little chairs before the soap and patent medicine-piled counter, {{and her lips}} opened and closed.|$|E
60|$|But, with a {{gleam of}} her natural self-reliance, she {{declined}} his aid, and, after touching her cold hand to his, went and sat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the cushioned divans that were ranged against the wall.|$|E
50|$|The Sawhorse Table {{takes place}} on the ship. Costello creates a table by putting a board on a sawhorse.

Neither <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them are aware of what is happening, until the table finally loses its balance and a cake flies off the table into Pendleton's face.|$|R
50|$|The TM-35 was a rectangular, metal-cased Soviet {{anti-tank}} mine {{used during the}} Second World War. The mine has a metal case, which is rectangular with a carrying handle <b>on</b> <b>one</b> side and a large raised pressure plate in the centre. Sufficient pressure on the central pressure plate presses <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> end <b>of</b> an internal see-saw like lever, which removes the retaining pin from an MUV fuze, releasing the striker, triggering the mine.|$|R
60|$|As for Earl, {{the shock}} also {{caused him to}} lose his balance, and he went <b>down</b> heavily <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the packs with which the Wild Goose was freighted.

The craft had swung around, as has been related, {{and was on the}} point of smashing on the rocks when he put out the oar and tried to sheer off.|$|R
6000|$|... "That settles it," [...] snorted the fat man, as he sank <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the seats. [...] "No more ocean {{pictures}} for me! All the dramas I act in after {{this will be}} on dry land." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{was terrified}} {{and of course}} convinced, for she was easy of conviction, believing always {{the last person to}} whom she spoke. She sat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the boxes that {{furnished}} that cheerless refuge of Mr. Butler's.|$|E
60|$|But {{all these}} facts were of course none of Diogenes' business. At his host's {{invitation}} he had sat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the ricketty chairs and {{then proceeded to}} extract some papers from out the inner lining of his doublet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Sir," [...] {{said the}} young man. He had the {{frequent}} [...] "Sir" [...] of the subaltern.

[...] "You see, Sir, we've hardly known each other--I mean we've been associated over a philosophical society and all that sort of thing, but in a more familiar way, I mean...." ...|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, the {{travelers}} to Terramort are having problems of their own. In the thick fog wreathing the ocean, Mariel and Tarquin {{are unable to}} see a large ship bearing <b>down</b> <b>on</b> them. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> Gabool’s ships named the Seatalon rams the Greenfang, and all four travelers are thrown into the sea. Dandin and Durry are captured by the pirate ship, and Mariel and Tarquin tread water, using the hare’s harolina as a float.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{just come}} <b>down</b> the Coast <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the Pacific mail steamers. She was behind time, an' around the Puget Sound ports we worked like niggers, storing cargo-mixed freight, {{if you know}} what that means. That's how the skin got knocked off." ...|$|R
