5|$|Antioxidants {{that are}} {{reducing}} agents can also act as pro-oxidants. For example, vitamin C has antioxidant activity when <b>it</b> <b>reduces</b> oxidizing substances such as hydrogen peroxide, however, {{it will also}} reduce metal ions that generate free radicals through the Fenton reaction.|$|E

5|$|In {{recent years}} {{germanium}} has seen increasing use in precious metal alloys. In sterling silver alloys, for instance, <b>it</b> <b>reduces</b> firescale, increases tarnish resistance, and improves precipitation hardening. A tarnish-proof silver alloy trademarked Argentium contains 1.2% germanium.|$|E
5|$|Bina Agarwal and Pradeep Panda {{illustrate}} that a woman's property status (such as owning {{a house or}} land) directly and significantly reduces her chances of experiencing domestic violence, while employment makes little difference. They argue that such immovable property increases women's self-esteem, economic security, and strengthens their fall-back positions, enhancing their options and bargaining clout. They show that property ownership is an important contributor to women's economic well-being because <b>it</b> <b>reduces</b> their susceptibility to violence.|$|E
5|$|Dual motor {{electric}} – At higher vehicle speeds {{the secondary}} motor engages over the planetary gear such that <b>it</b> <b>reduces</b> {{the speed of}} the primary motor. This facilitates higher efficiency and better mileage for the combined system, without increasing the maximum power.|$|E

5|$|More {{controversial}} is {{the addition}} of ezetimibe, which inhibits cholesterol absorption in the gut. While <b>it</b> <b>reduces</b> LDL cholesterol, {{it does not appear}} to improve a marker of atherosclerosis called the intima-media thickness. Whether this means that ezetimibe is of no overall benefit in FH is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Prostitution is {{considered}} sinful {{for both the}} prostitute and the customer; <b>it</b> <b>reduces</b> a person to an instrument of sexual pleasure, violating human dignity and harming society. The gravity of the sinfulness is less for prostitutes who are forced into the act by destitution, blackmail or social pressure.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{metformin}} {{during all}} parts of pregnancy is controversial. One review found that when taken during pregnancy <b>it</b> <b>reduces</b> the number of complications during pregnancy and {{does not appear to}} cause developmental delays. Another review found good short term safety for both the mother and baby but unclear long term safety.|$|E

5|$|Binary stars form a {{significant}} portion of the total population of stellar systems, with up to half of all stars occurring in binary systems. Numerical simulations of globular clusters have demonstrated that binaries can hinder and even reverse the process of core collapse in globular clusters. When a star in a cluster has a gravitational encounter with a binary system, a possible result is that the binary becomes more tightly bound and kinetic energy is added to the solitary star. When the massive stars in the cluster are sped up by this process, <b>it</b> <b>reduces</b> the contraction at the core and limits core collapse.|$|E
5|$|Innovation management: The {{value of}} the {{coordinating}} role of design in new product development has been well documented. Design management can help to improve innovation management, which can be measured by three variables: <b>it</b> <b>reduces</b> time-to-market, by improving sources and communication skills and developing cross-functional innovation; it stimulates networking innovation, by managing product and customer information flows with internal (e.g. teams) and external (e.g. suppliers, society) actors; it improves the learning process by promoting a continuous learning process.|$|E
5|$|Operating {{close to}} the power station is a fishing bait company, Seabait. Seabait uses some of the excess hot water that the plant generates to grow worms four {{times as fast as}} in the wild. The worms are used for several purposes, {{primarily}} for providing worms as bait while fishing. However, the worms are also frozen, packaged and exported to seafood farms. This is seen as environmentally beneficial as <b>it</b> <b>reduces</b> the need for bait digging in natural habitats.|$|E

5|$|Quenching {{involves}} {{heating the}} steel {{to create the}} austenite phase then quenching it in water or oil. This rapid cooling results in a hard but brittle martensitic structure. The steel is then tempered, {{which is just a}} specialized type of annealing, to reduce brittleness. In this application the annealing (tempering) process transforms some of the martensite into cementite, or spheroidite and hence <b>it</b> <b>reduces</b> the internal stresses and defects. The result is a more ductile and fracture-resistant steel.|$|E
5|$|The best-studied medical {{treatment}} for intracranial hypertension is acetazolamide (Diamox), which acts by inhibiting the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, and <b>it</b> <b>reduces</b> CSF production by six to 57 percent. It {{can cause the}} symptoms of hypokalemia (low blood potassium levels), which include muscle weakness and tingling in the fingers. Acetazolamide cannot be used in pregnancy, since {{it has been shown}} to cause embryonic abnormalities in animal studies. Also, in human beings it has been shown to cause metabolic acidosis as well as disruptions in the blood electrolyte levels of newborn babies. The diuretic furosemide is sometimes used for a treatment if acetazolamide is not tolerated, but this drug sometimes has little effect on the ICP.|$|E
5|$|The male, {{which plays}} {{no part in}} nesting or chick care, leaves the {{breeding}} grounds in late June or early July, followed later in July by the female and juveniles. Males typically make shorter flights and winter further north than females; for example, virtually all wintering ruffs in Britain are males, whereas in Kenya most are females. Many migratory species use this differential wintering strategy, since <b>it</b> <b>reduces</b> feeding competition between the sexes and enables territorial males to reach the breeding grounds as early as possible, improving their chances of successful mating. Male ruffs may {{also be able to}} tolerate colder winter conditions because they are larger than females.|$|E

5|$|The plumage of most seabirds is less {{colourful}} {{than that}} of land birds, restricted in the main to variations of black, white or grey. A few species sport colourful plumes (such as the tropicbirds and some penguins), {{but most of the}} colour in seabirds appears in the bills and legs. The plumage of seabirds is thought in many cases to be for camouflage, both defensive (the colour of US Navy battleships is {{the same as that of}} Antarctic prions, and in both cases <b>it</b> <b>reduces</b> visibility at sea) and aggressive (the white underside possessed by many seabirds helps hide them from prey below).|$|E
5|$|Waste is {{delivered}} to the station by road, using up to 100 waste collection vehicles. Up to 2,800 tonnes of waste a week or as much as 1,000 tonnes of waste a day, can be delivered at the plant. A rail head was also built on the railway sidings adjacent to the site in 2009. This allows for waste to be {{delivered to the}} plant by rail, rather than just by road. This is more sustainable as <b>it</b> <b>reduces</b> the amount of traffic on local roads. In December 2011, {{it was announced that}} the rail head would be used to receive up 500,000 tonnes of residual waste per year from Merseyside via a rail waste transfer facility at Knowley Industrial Park, Kirby, in a contract worth £400million.|$|E
5|$|MD 410 {{continues}} east between Hyattsville to {{the south}} and the town of University Park to the north; {{the south side of the}} six-lane divided highway becomes flanked by the town of Riverdale Park ahead of its intersection with US 1 (Baltimore Avenue). The highway fully enters Riverdale Park east of US 1, where <b>it</b> <b>reduces</b> to four lanes and crosses over CSX's Capital Subdivision, which carries MARC's Camden Line. The Camden Line is accessed by the Riverdale railroad station within the Riverdale Park Historic District {{to the south}}, which contains the Riversdale Mansion. A tributary of Northeast Branch Anacostia River briefly runs within the median of the highway shortly before the highway crosses over Northeast Branch. MD 410 intersects MD 201 (Kenilworth Avenue) and leaves the town of Riverdale Park. The highway continues as Riverdale Road, a four-lane road with center turn lane, through the unincorporated area of East Riverdale on its way to a diamond interchange with the BaltimoreWashington Parkway (unsigned MD 295).|$|E
