5|$|The {{stranding}} of the Northern bottlenose whale mainly {{happens in}} two {{villages in the}} northern part of Suðuroy: Hvalba and Sandvík. It is believed that it happens because of a navigation problem of the whale, because there are isthmuses on these places, where the distance between the east and west coasts are short, around one kilometer or so. And for some reason it seems like the bottlenose whale want to take a short cut through what <b>it</b> <b>thinks</b> is a sound, and too late it discovers, that is on shallow ground and is unable to turn around again. It happened on 30 August 2012, when two Northern bottlenose whales swam ashore to the gorge Sigmundsgjógv in Sandvík. Two men who were working on the harbour noticed these whales, and some time later they had either died by themselves or were killed by the locals and then cut up for food for the people of Sandvík and Hvalba (Hvalba municipality).|$|E

25|$|Under the {{principles}} of stare decisis (judicial precedent), Court of Appeal decisions are binding on the High Court and State Courts. As Singapore's final appellate court, the Court of Appeal {{is not required to}} follow its own previous decisions and the decisions of predecessor courts such as the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and may depart from or overrule such decisions if <b>it</b> <b>thinks</b> fit. However, it will generally not do so without a strong reason. The Court of Appeal is required, however, to abide by decisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore Tribunal in certain situations. The Constitution of Singapore states that where the President has referred to the Tribunal a question concerning the Constitution's effect on a bill, no court– including the Court of Appeal– may subsequently question the Tribunal's opinion on the bill or, assuming the bill is found to be constitutional, the validity of any law based on the bill.|$|E
25|$|If, in the {{exercise}} of its discretion on a public duty, an authority takes into account considerations which the courts consider not to be proper, then {{in the eyes of the}} law it has not exercised its discretion legally. On the other hand, considerations that are relevant to a public authority's decision are of two kinds: there are mandatory relevant considerations (that is, considerations that the statute empowering the authority expressly or impliedly identifies as those that must be taken into account), and discretionary relevant considerations (those which the authority may take into account if it regards them as appropriate). If a decision-maker has determined that a particular consideration is relevant to its decision, it is entitled to attribute to it whatever weight <b>it</b> <b>thinks</b> fit, and the courts will not interfere unless it has acted in a Wednesbury-unreasonable manner. This is consistent with the principle that the courts are generally only concerned with the legality of decisions and not their merits.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the hearing}} of an appeal, the Court may confirm, reverse or vary the trial court's decision. It may also order a retrial; inform the High Court of its opinion on a matter {{and send it}} back to that court for further {{proceedings}} to be taken; or make any other order as <b>it</b> <b>thinks</b> just, exercising any power that the trial court might have exercised. The Court also has power to quash the sentence passed by the trial court and substitute a more or less severe sentence in its place. A trial court's judgment, sentence or order may only be reversed or set aside if it was legally incorrect or against the weight of the evidence. A sentence may only be altered if it is manifestly excessive or inadequate in the circumstances of the case. Even if the Court feels that a point raised in an appeal might be decided in the appellant's favour, it may dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice took place. The Court generally only issues a single judgment, though separate judgments may be given if the presiding Judge of Appeal so directs.|$|E

25|$|Part V of the Act {{provides}} that whenever the Minister for Home Affairs is satisfied that a person, whether at large or in custody, {{has been associated}} with activities of a criminal nature, the Minister may, with the consent of the Public Prosecutor, order that the person be detained for any period not exceeding 12 months if he is satisfied that the detention is necessary in the interests of public safety, peace and good order; or order that the person be subject to police supervision for any period not exceeding three years if he is satisfied that this is necessary. Within 28 days of a detention order being made, the Minister must refer the order and a statement of the grounds upon which the order was made to an advisory committee. The advisory committee must submit a written report on the making of the order, with recommendations as <b>it</b> <b>thinks</b> fit, to the President of Singapore, who may cancel or confirm the order. The President may, from time to time, extend the validity of any detention order for periods not exceeding 12 months at any one time, and may at any time refer any such orders for further consideration by an advisory committee. Between 2008 and 2012, the average number of detention orders issued each year was 43, and as of 31 October 2013 there were 209 people detained under the CLTPA.|$|E

[...] Jim Farber of The New York Daily News said West [...] "gave her a dark needling rhythm {{that sounds like}} something left over from his last album.

[...] Andrew Unterberger of Spin said the song [...] "wastes a potentially explosive, blacklit Kanye beat on a muddled, hashtagging lyric that isn’t even as conspiracy-baiting as <b>it</b> <b>thinks</b> it is". New Zealand Herald's Lydia Jenkin was more critical, writing that it [...] "sounds like a trying-too-hard version of Lady Gaga meets M.I.A.".

500|$|... "Get Sexy" [...] {{garnered}} {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary music critics. Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian described the song as a [...] "grinding, fiercely catchy R number".

It may not be massively original, nor an instant classic to rival 'About You Now' or 'Push the Button', but with a Right Said Fred-sampling hook, a thundering chorus and plenty of attitude – most noticeably from Amelle – it returns Sugababes right to the forefront of the pop landscape.' Popjustice positively reviewed [...] "Get Sexy", saying [...] "'Get Sexy' is a punchy, explosive pop single which while not being quite as adventurous as <b>it</b> <b>thinks</b> it could never be described as a pedestrian". Fraser McAlpine of BBC gave the single a mainly negative review, calling it a [...] "mess" [...] which has [...] "not bothered to make it rhyme" [...] in the way the original, 'I'm Too Sexy' did.

500|$|Brian Lowry, {{reviewing}} the two-part premiere for Variety, felt that giving Atwell her own television series was [...] "a pretty smart bet" [...] by Marvel, {{and he called}} the episodes [...] "considerable fun". He noted the period setting as contributing to this, and positively mentioned the score by composer Christopher Lennertz. Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly felt that [...] "the show isn't as retro-stylish as <b>it</b> <b>thinks</b> it is ... the first hour of Agent Carter feels like an above-average episode of Young Indiana Jones Chronicles", noting that it tonally aims for His Girl Friday, Dick Tracy, and Alias ("A tough tonal mixture on a weekly broadcast budget, but also an ambition worth pursuing"), but praised Atwell's performance, calling her [...] "a delight" [...] and [...] "firing on all cylinders". Franich was negative about what he saw to be common MCU tropes, notably [...] "Somebody named Stark invented something dangerous; everyone wants an All-Important Glowing Thing; there's an implicit promise that nothing will be solved for weeks/years to come." [...] Though he was wary about the series being forced {{to contribute to the}} rest of the MCU, he did note that [...] "Agent Carter feels pleasantly segmented off from the greater Marvel Machinery".|$|E
500|$|... "Improbable" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity awarded the episode a [...] "B+". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their book}} Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, and called the script [...] "very witty". The two wrote that [...] "the brilliance of Chris Carter's direction" [...] allowed the viewer of the episode to see it [...] "from God's point of view". Shearman and Pearson concluded that the episode [...] "is not as smart as <b>it</b> <b>thinks</b> it is. But it's still pretty smart." [...] John Keegan, writing for Critical Myth, on the other hand, gave the episode a more mixed review {{and gave it a}} 6 out of 10 rating. He wrote that [...] "overall, this episode was amusing enough, but there was nothing about it that would prompt me to rank it as highly as the more inspired [...] "lite" [...] episodes of previous seasons. And considering that the sixth and seventh seasons suffered tremendously from too many episodes like this, it's a shame to see them do it again." [...] M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, called the episode [...] "bizarre yet amusing" [...] and said that the central numerology story [...] "doesn't feel like it's enough to sustain an entire episode".|$|E
500|$|David Lynch uses various {{methods of}} {{deception}} in Mulholland Drive. A shadowy figure named Mr. Roque, {{who seems to}} control film studios, is portrayed by dwarf actor Michael J. Anderson (also from Twin Peaks). Anderson, who has only two lines and is seated in an enormous wooden wheelchair, was fitted with oversized foam prosthetic arms and legs in order to portray his head as abnormally small. During Adam and Camilla's party, Diane watches Camilla (played by Harring) with Adam on one arm, lean over and deeply kiss the same woman who appeared as Camilla (Melissa George) before the blue box was opened. Both then turn and smile pointedly at Diane. Film critic Franklin Ridgway writes that the depiction of such a deliberate [...] "cruel and manipulative" [...] act makes it unclear if Camilla is as capricious as she seems, or if Diane's paranoia is allowing the audience only {{to see what she}} senses. In a scene immediately after Betty's audition, the film cuts to a woman singing without apparent accompaniment, but as the camera pulls backwards, the audience sees that it is a recording studio. In actuality, it is a sound stage where Betty has just arrived to meet Adam Kesher, that the audience realizes as the camera pulls back further. Ridgway insists that such deception through artful camera work sets the viewer full of doubt about what is being presented: [...] "It is as if the camera, in its graceful fluidity of motion, reassures us that <b>it</b> (<b>thinks</b> it) sees everything, has everything under control, even if we (and Betty) do not." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{regards the}} second question, in R. v. North and East Devon Health Authority, ex parte Coughlan (1999), the Court of Appeal of England and Wales {{identified}} {{three categories of}} legitimate expectations. Category (b) involves procedural legitimate expectations, and so are not discussed here because breaches of them are a form of procedural impropriety rather than illegality. Categories (a) and (c) relate to substantive legitimate expectations. Category (a) cases are those which lie [...] "in what may inelegantly be called the macro-political field". The public authority [...] "is only required {{to bear in mind}} its previous policy or other representation, giving it the weight <b>it</b> <b>thinks</b> right, but no more, before deciding whether to change course", and the court may only review the authority's decision on the ground of Wednesbury unreasonableness. On the other hand, category (c) cases are usually those [...] "where the expectation is confined to one person or a few people, giving the promise or representation the character of a contract". When assessing such a case, the court decides whether for a public authority to frustrate an expectation is so unfair that it amounts to an abuse of power. The court must weigh the requirements of fairness towards the individual against any overriding interests relied by the authorities to justify the change of policy. A slightly different approach has been adopted by Lord Justice John Laws. In R. v. Secretary of State for Education and Employment, ex parte Begbie (1999), he suggested that the Coughlan categories are not [...] "hermetically sealed", and in Nadarajah v. Secretary of State for the Home Department (2005), he expanded on this by taking a proportionality approach: ...|$|E
500|$|However, the courts' role in {{protecting}} substantive legitimate expectations was clearly {{established by the}} Court of Appeal of England and Wales in R. v. North and East Devon Health Authority, ex parte Coughlan (1999). The case involved an applicant who was promised by her local authority that a new nursing home would be her [...] "home for life". The Court granted the application for review {{on the ground that}} the applicant had a legitimate expectation to have the substantive benefit of staying in the nursing home as promised by the local authority. It also set out the approach to be taken in safeguarding procedural and substantive legitimate expectations. Where procedural legitimate expectations were concerned, courts would require an opportunity for consultation to be given unless there was an overriding reason to resile from it (such as the national security concern that arose in the GCHQ case). As regards substantive legitimate expectations, courts would decide whether cases lie [...] "... in what may inelegantly be called the macro-political field", or are those [...] "where the expectation is confined to one person or a few people, giving the promise or representation the character of a contract". In the first situation, the public authority [...] "is only required to bear in mind its previous policy or other representation, giving it the weight <b>it</b> <b>thinks</b> right, but no more, before deciding whether to change course", and the court may only review the authority's decision on the ground of Wednesbury unreasonableness. On the other hand, when assessing a case in the second situation, the court decides whether for an authority to frustrate an expectation is so unfair that it amounts to an abuse of power. The court must weigh the requirements of fairness towards the individual against any overriding interests relied by the authorities to justify the change of policy.|$|E
