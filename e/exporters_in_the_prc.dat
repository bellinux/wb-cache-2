Strong political control governed diagnosis and treatment as well as detention and discharge of mental patients during the Cultural Revolution (1964 - 1976). Later, because of modernization and reform advocated by Deng Xiao-ping, western models of treatment and rehabilitation were gradually introduced by psychiatrists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PRC.</b> Nevertheless, dilemmas such as human rights versus political control, community integration versus community control, diversity versus centrality, huge demand but inadequate services seemed to challenge the further development of the mental health service <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PRC.</b> Department of Applied Social Science...|$|R

40|$|The rapid {{economic}} growth of the People’s Republic of China (<b>PRC)</b> over <b>the</b> last 30 years has generated many environmental problems and a concomitant rise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of environmental disputes.

40|$|The year 2008 {{witnessed}} <b>the</b> renewed interests <b>in</b> {{earthquake risk}} management and insurance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> People's Republic of China (<b>PRC),</b> after <b>the</b> Wenchuan earthquake hit <b>the</b> country <b>in</b> May. Located along the southeastern {{edge of the}} Euro-Asian Plate, <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> has a relatively high seismicity, which is manifested by the frequent occurrence of large and disastrous earthquakes. Buildings and infrastructure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> earthquake-prone regions of <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> have relatively low earthquake resistance levels. Hence, disastrous earthquakes result not only in large numbers of injuries and fatalities but also in huge economic losses from property damages. While <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> began testing earthquake insurance programs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1980 s, the overall penetration rate remains very low. The low penetration rate not only creates disruptions for the government after a major earthquake but also, in some cases, delays the reconstruction efforts. Moreover, {{as a result of}} the low penetration of earthquake insurance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PRC,</b> <b>the</b> government serves as the predominant bearer of financial risk from earthquake catastrophes. This paper discusses historical earthquakes and earthquake risk <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> and <b>the</b> recent developments of PRC's earthquake risk reduction efforts. The general principles of earthquake programs are explained and the critical issues of formulating earthquake programs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> are discussed, including lessons from earthquake insurance in other countries and other catastrophe insurance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PRC,</b> data issues, loss risk modeling issues, financial risk modeling issues, legislative issues, and public awareness issues. The paper concludes with several policy directions that the Asian Development Bank can take to help <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> <b>in</b> its design and implementation of earthquake insurance. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> {{meteoric}} growth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{economy of}} the People’s Republic of China (<b>PRC),</b> <b>the</b> success of <b>the</b> <b>PRC’s</b> increasingly vast participation in international trade and commerce {{could be viewed as}} resting at the intersection of three bodies of law: <b>PRC</b> Contract Law, <b>the</b> United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG), and the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts (UPICC). If these three sources of law are not properly understood or correctly applied, their interplay can undermine uniformity goals that {{are at the heart of}} modern efforts to create an international legal regime on which buyers and sellers can, or must, depend. Further, these modern efforts often struggle against historical influences and biases of local law, courts and arbitration tribunals. These tensions are arguably felt most acutely <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> today, which, because of its burgeoning growth and enormous contribution as supplier of goods to the world’s developed and developing nations, stands to suffer if its internal law cannot be reconciled and applied consistently with international rules of law on contracts for international sales as reflected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> CISG and the UPICC. This research seeks to identify what barriers that the application of the CISG has faced and continues to face <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PRC.</b> It examines those barriers arise from traditional understandings of contract law <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> and <b>the</b> attitudes of <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> jurists and legal practitioners towards international uniform sales law instruments. It will put forward a number of proposals for overcoming those obstacles to the application of <b>the</b> CISG <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PRC,</b> including <b>the</b> Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (as part of <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> since 1997) and Macau Special Administrative Region (as part of <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> since 1999), and Taiwan, whose political and legal status remains contentious.

40|$|The People's Republic of China (PRC) {{has become}} an {{important}} importer for many countries. This paper investigates how turbulence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> can spill over to trading partners through the trade channel. Exports from several East Asian and Southeast Asian countries to <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> exceed 10 % of their gross domestic products. To shed light on economies' exposures to <b>the</b> <b>PRC,</b> this paper estimates a gravity model. The results indicate that Taipei,China {{and members of the}} Association of Southeast Asian Nations are exposed to <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> because they produce goods for <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> market and are exposed to advanced economies because they ship parts and components to <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> for processing and reexport to the West. The Republic of Korea is more exposed to a slowdown in advanced economies that purchase processed exports from <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> than to a slowdown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PRC.</b> Major commodity <b>exporters</b> such as Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia and exporters of sophisticated consumption and capital goods such as Germany and Switzerland are exposed to a slowdown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> domestic market. This paper also estimates import elasticities for <b>the</b> <b>PRC.</b> <b>The</b> results indicate that imports for processing into <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> are closely linked to processed exports from <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> to <b>the</b> {{rest of the world and}} that ordinary imports are closely linked to PRC gross domestic product. The renminbi exerts only a weak impact on imports, however.

40|$|With special {{reference}} to the People's Republic of China (PRC), this paper examines relationships between law, education reform and social transformation that have been under-researched. The argument is that, despite national leaders' high expectations, the use of law to effect or consolidate educational reform <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> is affected by both legal and extra-legal factors such as politics, economics, and social norms and cultures. The paper first establishes a framework within which <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> is analyzed. Secondly, the paper looks into <b>the</b> policy context <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> <b>PRC</b> adopts <b>the</b> strategy of using law to govern the nation and education, and examines the contrasting scenarios between promotion of governance of education with the law, and public defiance of education laws <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>PRC.</b> Thirdly, <b>the</b> paper analyzes the deep-seated problems behind <b>the</b> scenario <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wider social and political contexts that shape education and law, and examines the role of law in governance and social change. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
