50|$|Xerography or <b>electrophotography</b> is a {{photocopying}} technique. Its {{fundamental principle}} {{was invented by}} Chester Carlson in 1938 and developed and commercialized by the Xerox Corporation, which is used for high-quality printing. To begin with, the technique was called <b>electrophotography,</b> then it was renamed to xerography. In traditional reproduction techniques, liquid chemicals are involved in printing process. Xerography use photoconductive polymer as the foundation material, which is solid chemicals.|$|E
50|$|During this period, Battelle {{conducted}} most of {{the basic}} research into <b>electrophotography,</b> while Haloid concentrated on {{trying to make a}} commercial product out of the results. In 1948, Haloid's CEO, Joseph Wilson, convinced the U.S. Army Signal Corps to invest $100,000 in the technology, an amount that would double later. The Signal Corps was concerned about nuclear war. The traditional photographic techniques they used for reconnaissance would not function properly when exposed to the radiation from a nuclear attack; the film would fog, much as consumer photographic film can be fogged by an airport X-ray machine. The Signal Corps thought that <b>electrophotography</b> might be developed into a product that would be immune to such radiation. Through the 1950s, over half the money Battelle spent developing <b>electrophotography</b> came from government contracts.|$|E
5000|$|Xerography or <b>electrophotography</b> is a dry {{photocopying}} technique. Its {{fundamental principle}} {{was invented by}} Hungarian physicist Pál Selényi and based on Selényi's publications Chester Carlson applied for and was awarded [...] on October 6, 1942. The technique was originally called <b>electrophotography.</b> It was later renamed xerography—from the Greek roots [...] xeros, [...] "dry" [...] and [...] -graphia, [...] "writing"—to emphasize that, unlike reproduction techniques then in use such as cyanotype, this process used no liquid chemicals.|$|E
5000|$|Sensitized photoinjection -- {{demonstrated}} that the processes of carrier generation and carrier transport could be separated and is used in modern <b>electrophotography</b> and molecularly doped polymers. It is also the basis of Dye-Sensitized Excitonic Solar Cells.|$|E
50|$|After {{years of}} trying to {{interest}} additional licensees in <b>electrophotography,</b> Battelle agreed to renegotiate with Haloid, making it the exclusive licensee for the invention (except for a few minor uses that Battelle wished to retain for itself).|$|E
50|$|It was {{the expense}} and {{inconvenience}} of photostats that drove Chester Carlson to study <b>electrophotography.</b> In the mid-1940s Carlson sold {{the rights to}} his inventionwhich became known as xerographyto the Haloid Company and photostatting soon sank into history.|$|E
5000|$|He is {{best known}} for having invented the process of <b>electrophotography,</b> which {{produced}} a dry copy rather than a wet copy, as was produced by the mimeograph process. Carlson's process was subsequently renamed xerography, a term that literally means [...] "dry writing." ...|$|E
5000|$|... 1976: Laser printerThe first IBM 3800 printer is installed. The 3800 is {{the first}} {{commercial}} printer to combine laser technology and <b>electrophotography.</b> The technology speeds the printing of bank statements, premium notices, and other high-volume documents, and remains a workhorse for billing and accounts receivable departments.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s and early 1990s, thermal transfer, laser {{printing}}, <b>electrophotography,</b> and, {{to a lesser}} extent, ink jet printing began to take away industrial and warehouse barcode applications due to better durability. Direct thermal made a strong comeback with point of sale receipts (gasoline pumps, cash registers, rental car receipts, etc.).|$|E
50|$|In 1947, Carlson was {{becoming}} worried that Battelle was not developing <b>electrophotography</b> quickly enough; his patent would expire in ten years. After meeting with Joe Wilson, Carlson accepted {{an offer to}} become a consultant to Haloid. He and his wife Dorris moved to the Rochester area, to be near the company's base of operations.|$|E
5000|$|His {{discoveries of}} ohmic {{contacts}} {{and research in}} the fields of organic insulators and semiconductors led to techniques enabling organic semiconductors to carry relatively large currents, and to convert electricity into light and vice versa. These discoveries have had application in <b>electrophotography,</b> organic light-emitting diodes (OLED), photovoltaic cells, biological sensors, transistors, molecular electronics and batteries.|$|E

5000|$|By 1948, Haloid {{realized}} {{that it would have}} to make a public announcement about <b>electrophotography</b> in order to retain its claims to the technology. However, the term <b>electrophotography</b> troubled Haloid; for one thing, its use of the term [...] "photography" [...] invited unwelcome comparisons with traditional duplicating technologies. After considering several options, Haloid chose a term invented by a public-relations employee at Battelle, who had asked a classics professor at Ohio State University for ideas. The professor suggested the term xerography—formed by combining the Greek words xeros ("dry") and graphein ("writing"). Carlson was not fond of the name, but Haloid's Wilson liked it, and so Haloid's board of directors voted to adopt it. The company's patent department wanted to trademark [...] "xerography;" [...] Haloid's head of sales and advertising, John Hartnett, vetoed the idea: [...] "Don't do that. We want people to use the word." ...|$|E
50|$|Molecularly doped {{polymers}} {{are prepared}} by spreading {{a film of}} an electrically inert polymer, e.g. polycarbonate, doped with typically 30% of charge transporting molecules, on a base electrode. Typical materials are the triphenylenes. They have been investigated for use as photoreceptors in <b>electrophotography.</b> This requires films have a thickness of several micrometers that can be prepared using the doctor-blade technique.|$|E
50|$|In December 1946, Battelle, Carlson, and Haloid {{signed the}} first {{agreement}} to license <b>electrophotography</b> {{for a commercial}} product. The $10,000 contract—representing ten percent of Haloid's total earnings from 1945—granted a nonexclusive right to make electophotography-based copying machines intended to make no more than twenty copies of an original. Both sides were tentative; Battelle was concerned by Haloid's relatively small size, and Haloid had concerns about electrophotography's viability.|$|E
50|$|In 1944, the Battelle Memorial Institute, a {{non-profit}} organization in Columbus, Ohio, contracted with Carlson to refine his new process. Over the next five years, the institute conducted experiments to improve the process of <b>electrophotography.</b> In 1947, Haloid Corporation (a small New York-based manufacturer and seller of photographic paper) approached Battelle to obtain a license to develop and market a copying machine based on this technology.|$|E
50|$|The {{commercial}} breakthrough {{came when}} John Dessauer, chief {{of research at}} the Haloid Company, read an article about Carlson's invention. Haloid, a manufacturer of photographic paper, was looking for {{a way out of the}} shadow of its Rochester, New York, neighbor, Eastman Kodak. Through previous acquisitions, Haloid was already in the duplicating-machine business; Dessauer thought that <b>electrophotography</b> might allow Haloid to expand into a new field that Kodak did not dominate.|$|E
50|$|In 1958, the Kirlians {{reported}} {{the results of}} their experiments for the first time. Their work was virtually unknown until 1970, when two Americans, Lynn Schroeder and Sheila Ostrander, published a book, Psychic Discoveries Behind the Iron Curtain. High-voltage <b>electrophotography</b> soon became known to the general public as Kirlian photography. Although little interest was generated among western scientists, Russians held a conference on the subject in 1972 at Kazakh State University.|$|E
50|$|Photoconductive {{polymers}} absorb {{electromagnetic radiation}} and produce on increase of electrical conductivity. Photoconductive polymers {{have been used}} {{in a wide variety of}} technical applications such as Xerography (<b>electrophotography)</b> and laser printing. Electrical conductivity is usually very small in organic compounds. Conductive polymers usually have large electrical conductivity. Photoconductive polymer is a smart material based on conductive polymer, and the electrical conductivity can be controlled by the amount of radiation.|$|E

50|$|Kornei was not {{as excited}} about {{the results of the}} {{experiment}} as Carlson. Within a year, he left Carlson on cordial terms. His pessimism about <b>electrophotography</b> was so strong that he decided to dissolve his agreement with Carlson that would have given Kornei ten percent of Carlson's future proceeds from the invention and partial rights to the inventions they had worked on together. Years later, when Xerox stock was soaring, Carlson sent Kornei a gift of one hundred shares in the company. Had Kornei held onto that gift, it would have been worth more than $1 million by 1972.|$|E
50|$|Other methods with {{similarities}} to printing, among them microcontact printing and nano-imprint lithography are of interest. Here, µm- and nm-sized layers, respectively, are prepared by methods similar to stamping with soft and hard forms, respectively. Often the actual structures are prepared subtractively, e.g. by deposition of etch masks or by lift-off processes. For example, electrodes for OFETs can be prepared. Sporadically pad printing {{is used in}} a similar manner. Occasionally so-called transfer methods, where solid layers are transferred from a carrier to the substrate, are considered printed electronics. <b>Electrophotography</b> is currently not used in printed electronics.|$|E
50|$|Work on {{conductivity}} of anthracene crystals contacted with an electrolyte {{showed that}} optically excited dye molecules adsorbed {{at the surface}} of the crystal inject a charge carriers. The underlying phenomenon is called sensitized photoconductivity. It occurs when photo-exciting a dye molecule with appropriate oxidation/reduction potential adsorbed at the surface or incorporated in the bulk. This effect revolutionized <b>electrophotography</b> which is the technological basis of today’s office copying machines. It is also the basis of organic solar cells (OSCs) in which the active element is an electron donor and an electron acceptor material is combined in a bilayer or a bulk hetero junction.|$|E
5000|$|Electrophysiological {{recording}} {{in general}} is sometimes called electrography (from [...] + , [...] "electrical recording"), with the record thus produced being an electrogram. However, the word electrography has other senses (including <b>electrophotography),</b> and the specific types of electrophysiological recording are usually called by specific names, constructed on the pattern of electro- + part combining form + -graphy (abbreviation ExG). Relatedly, the word electrogram (not being needed for those other senses) often carries the specific meaning of intracardiac electrogram, which is like an electrocardiogram but with some invasive leads (inside the heart) rather than only noninvasive leads (on the skin). Electrophysiological recording for clinical diagnostic purposes is included within the category of electrodiagnostic testing. The various [...] "ExG" [...] modes are as follows: ...|$|E
5000|$|The latest work {{represents}} {{a return to}} documentary photography. The influence of the different medias used {{over the past years}} remains very important [...] These works are in fact printed with <b>Electrophotography</b> (LED head) technique, with Organic Photoconductor Drum and closed toner system, on special and unusual papers, such as black recycled paper, rice paper and other handmade papers.The work is in black and white, and highlights “places that do not exist”: the objects and environments which surround us in our daily life: gas stations, highways, tunnels, trucks.The work explores “non-interesting places and events” and questions the common notion of photography associated with exceptional moments or places. Santoro-Woith does the opposite, and photographs the ordinary - everyday - sights, the “unnoticed landscapes of his time”.|$|E

40|$|Printing {{processes}} of <b>electrophotography</b> basically involve some unstableness of analog nature. These instabilities make small dot reproduction stochastic and degrade image quality. To overcome the analog instabilities in this paper, {{we have developed}} a dispersed-dot halftoning technique for high resolution <b>electrophotography.</b> Based on the characteristic of <b>electrophotography,</b> {{a combination of a}} Gaussian filter with a sigmoid nonlinear function was used to calculate the probability of toner transfer in print. We can obtain a predicted image in print using this nonlinear printer model. Halftone images having good image quality are formed under this model in a way so that the perceptive error with respect to an original gray scale image is small. To achieve this, unstable pixels that have their transfer probabilities within a band in our nonlinear printer model are eliminated as much as possible by an iterative improvement method. As a result, perceptive error was much improved compared to conventional cluster-dot halftoning...|$|E
