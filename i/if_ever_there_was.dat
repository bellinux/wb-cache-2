5|$|<b>If</b> <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a book {{calculated}} {{to make a}} man in love with its author, this appears {{to me to be}} the book. She speaks of her sorrows, in a way that fills us with melancholy, and dissolves us in tenderness, {{at the same time that}} she displays a genius which commands all our admiration. Affliction had tempered her heart to a softness almost more than human; and the gentleness of her spirit seems precisely to accord with all the romance of unbounded attachment.|$|E
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{need for}} an {{encouraging}} show, the M.C.C. needed one against Queensland, in the game {{that served as a}} curtain-raiser to the Test, but, instead the standard of cricket fell to a new low level...|$|E
500|$|Variety did not so qualify its review. [...] " [...] one {{of those}} rare {{instances}} where none can review it, or talk about it, without mentioning the cameraman, art director, and score composer in the same breath as the actors and director." [...] Variety also praised the cast, writing that [...] "Karloff manages to invest the character with some subtleties of emotion that are surprisingly real and touching... Thesiger as Dr Pretorious [...] a diabolic characterization <b>if</b> <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> one... Lanchester handles two assignments, being first in a preamble as author Mary Shelley and then the created woman. In latter assignment she impresses quite highly." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Human Nature" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave the song a positive review, stating that [...] "for years, Madonna spoke in metaphors, fantasies and blatant shock tactics, but the performer indignantly struck {{back at her}} critics on 'Human Nature'. She didn't just hold up a mirror, she became the mirror". Barbara O'Dair from Rolling Stone also gave a positive review of the song, commenting that [...] "Madonna does a drive-by on her critics, complete with a keening synth line straight outta Dre", adding that [...] "Madonna's message is still 'Express yourself, don't repress yourself.' This time, however, it comes not with a bang but a whisper". Scott Kearnan of The Boston Globe included the track at number 11 on his list of [...] "30 Ultimate Madonna Singles", stating that the line [...] "Absolutely no regrets" [...] was a [...] "Madonna mantra <b>if</b> <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> one".|$|E
500|$|After the election, Perot {{continued}} to work with [...] "United We Stand", and focused his efforts to defeat the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). In 1993, {{he was involved in}} a highly publicized debate with Vice President Al Gore on Larry King Live over NAFTA. Perot formed the Reform Party of the United States of America in 1995, and ran for president under the party's banner the following year. During the election, he failed to appear in the presidential debates, and finished in third place with about 8% of the vote, behind Republican nominee Bob Dole and President Bill Clinton. The Reform Party's candidate, former professional wrestler Jesse Ventura, was elected as Governor of Minnesota in 1998, which was connected to Perot's performance in the presidential elections. His focus on a balanced budget during his campaigns is speculated to have brought the issue to the forefront, enabling the surplus of the late 1990s. [...] Perot declined to run in the 2000 presidential election, and endorsed eventual winner Republican Governor George W. Bush of Texas. In 2008, he endorsed Republican Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts for the presidency, and stated [...] "the situation in 1992 was not nearly as bad as it is now... <b>if</b> <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{a time when it was}} necessary to put our house in order, it is now." [...] The members of the populist Tea Party movement have been compared to Perot advocates, for their support of a balanced budget.|$|E
2500|$|The song's {{religious}} imagery {{also includes}} references to Mary Magdalene meeting the risen Christ on Easter morning ("I see Mary in the garden"), and the Blood of Christ, although Springsteen {{has stated that}} the Mary in the song could also be the hero's wife or lover. Writer Jeffrey Symynkywicz evaluates the song as [...] "an Easterlike anthem arising {{out of the darkness}} and despair of September 11, a national Good Friday experience <b>if</b> <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> one." ...|$|E
6000|$|Alton bent {{a trifle}} over the little {{hand in the}} shabby glove that rested a moment in his palm. [...] "Well, <b>if</b> <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{anything}} you will let me know. You are a brave girl," [...] said he.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you be {{too sure}} on that p'int, lads," [...] put in Jack Broxton. [...] "It's mighty {{hard to make}} {{anything}} out of a bad egg, and Si Peters and Wash Crosby <b>are</b> bad eggs <b>if</b> <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> any." ...|$|R

"They make a {{fuss about}} all this White Slave Traffic," [...] said Susan, [...] "but <b>if</b> <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> white slaves it's the girls who {{work for a living}} and keep {{themselves}} respectable. And nobody wants to make an example of the men who get rich out of them...." ...|$|R
2500|$|On March 27, 2014, Hakamada was {{released}} from prison and granted a retrial by the Shizuoka District Court. A statement from the court said there was reason to believe evidence had been fabricated in the original trial and that keeping the 78-year-old jailed while waiting on the retrial would have been [...] "unbearably unjust". Amnesty International remarked, [...] "Time is running out for Hakamada to receive the fair trial he was denied more than four decades ago. <b>If</b> <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a case that merits a retrial, this is it." [...] A prosecution appeal of the decision to release Hakamada was denied. [...] Hakamada is the sixth Japanese death row inmate to be granted a retrial. [...] Four of the previous five were eventually acquitted.|$|E
2500|$|In another {{review that}} Richard Williams later cited {{as an example}} of the British pop press not being [...] "quite ready" [...] for the album, Melody Maker found the Beatles' new sound [...] "a little subdued" [...] and said that tracks such as [...] "You Won't See Me" [...] and [...] "Nowhere Man" [...] "almost get {{monotonous}} – an un-Beatle-like feature <b>if</b> <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> one". Author Steve Turner also highlights the comments made by the Melody Maker and Record Mirror reviewers, who were typically aged over 30, as indicative of how UK pop journalists lacked [...] "the critical vocabulary" [...] and [...] "the broad musical perspective" [...] to recognise or engage with progressive music. Turner adds that Rubber Soul [...] "may have perplexed the old guard of entertainment correspondents, but it was a beacon for fledgling rock critics (as they would soon be called)".|$|E
2500|$|After facing several club-level opponents, the International Boxing Club {{guaranteed}} Louis $300,000 to face undefeated heavyweight contender Rocky Marciano on October 26, 1951. Despite {{his being}} a 6-to-5 favorite, few boxing insiders believed Louis had a chance. Marciano himself {{was reluctant to}} participate in the bout, but was understanding of Louis's position: [...] "This is the last guy on earth I want to fight." [...] It was feared, particularly among those who had witnessed Marciano's punching power first-hand, that Louis's unwillingness to quit would result in serious injury. Fighting back tears, Ferdie Pacheco said in the SportsCentury documentary about his bout with Marciano, [...] "He [...] wasn't just going to lose. He was going to take a vicious, savage beating. Before the eyes of the nation, Joe Louis, an American hero <b>if</b> <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> one, was going to get beaten up." [...] Louis was dropped in the eighth round by a Marciano left and knocked through the ropes and out of the ring less than thirty seconds later.|$|E
500|$|The {{trial judge}} {{recommended}} {{that his life}} sentence should mean life, and successive Home Secretaries agreed with that decision. In 1982, the Lord Chief Justice Lord Lane said of Brady: [...] "this <b>is</b> the case <b>if</b> <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> to be one when a man should stay in prison till he dies". The death, in November 2007, of John Straffen, who had spent 55 {{years in prison for}} murdering three children meant that Brady became the longest serving prisoner in England and Wales.|$|R
60|$|Twenty {{years ago}} Stephen Clark {{had tried to}} go with Prissy Strong. That was pretty soon after Prissy's father had died. She and Emmeline were living alone together. Emmeline was thirty, {{ten years older than}} Prissy, and <b>if</b> <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> two sisters totally {{different}} from each other in every way, those two were Emmeline and Prissy Strong.|$|R
60|$|What a {{combination}} of fine humanities! Dance and song, patriotism and religion, so often parted among us, have flowed together into one in these stately villagers; each a small farmer; each a trained soldier, and probably a trained seaman also; each a self-governed citizen; and each a cultured gentleman, <b>if</b> <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> gentlemen on earth.|$|R
2500|$|Leigh's cricketing {{career and}} first class stats might be {{considered}} average {{but he was a}} popular choice as President of the MCC in its first centenary year in 1887 and the Golden Jubilee year of Queen Victoria. At the centenary MCC dinner at the old Tennis Court it was said of him his speech that night rivaled Leighton at the Royal Academy. [...] "I will say that the old cricketer stood up bravely in bumpy grounds in spite of awkward knocks and ugly bruises." [...] Wisden acknowledged him as an excellent [...] "long-stop" [...] who [...] "will let a ball go through him rather than by him" [...] and his style of batting was awkward, but he is a fine hitter forward and to leg. It was said of Leigh in his maturer years by one who had played many matches with him when he was captain of I Zingari teams, that <b>if</b> <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a man to pull a match out of the fire by his management, he was that man. The same principle which he carried out on hunting when he came to a big fence, [...] "throw your heart over and the body will follow" [...] was his rule with the bat – he would not be beat.|$|E
2500|$|Another lauded {{performance}} {{was that of}} Peggy Ashcroft as Margaret, whose role is usually heavily cut, and often eliminated entirely from both 1 Henry VI and, especially, Richard III. Margaret is the only character to appear in all four plays (unless one counts the Ghost of Henry VI in Richard III), and Ashcroft relished the chance to develop the character over the entire production, arguing that Margaret is [...] "a Dark Lady <b>if</b> <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> one - and prototype for Cressida, Cleopatra, Lady Macbeth - was Shakespeare's first [...] "heroine" [...] - if such she can be called [...] It takes four plays to make her {{one of the great}} female characters in Shakespeare - and the full-length portrait has been seen only in The Wars of the Roses cycle - but she has facets that are not touched on in any other." [...] Ashcroft saw the scene from 2 Henry VI where she appears on-stage carrying the head of her lover, the Duke of Suffolk, as pivotal to both the character's development and her own understanding of Margaret; [...] "I came to realise why this scene was of paramount importance - for later in what {{is one of the greatest}} and certainly most horrific scenes [...] when Margaret wipes the blood of York's son on the Duke's face [...] I found that seemingly impossible bestial act to be credible as the result of the violence that has been perpetrated on her lover." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1914 {{collection}} by Frank Thomas Bullen, Songs of Sea Labour, {{differed from}} the work of writers such as Masefield in having a more practical, rather than romantic, tone. Bullen, an Englishman, was an experienced shantyman, who sailed during the heyday of shanties to ports in the Southern U.S. and the Caribbean. He took a firm stance that only true work songs should be included in his collection, thus resisting the temptation to let shanties slide into the genres of ballads or other off-duty songs. (Pressure of his publisher forced him to include two sea songs, clearly demarcated, {{at the end of the}} book.) And rather than shape the shanties to appear as narrative pieces, he noted that, since most shanties would usually be improvised, it would be disingenuous to present more than one or two sample verses. As for his framing of the genre's origins, Bullen stated his belief that, [...] "he great majority of these tunes undoubtably emanated from the negroes of the Antilles and the Southern states, a most tuneful race <b>if</b> <b>ever</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> one, men moreover who seemed unable to pick up a ropeyarn without a song…" [...] And Bullen's musicologist editor, Arnold, claimed, [...] "he majority of the Chanties are Negroid in origin…" [...] Bullen's insistence on including only true work songs in the collection meant that he likely omitted songs—generally those for heaving tasks, like capstan work—which had been easily borrowed from the land-based traditions of various nations. The effect of including only the most exclusively work-oriented songs meant that a higher percentage of African-American songs were represented.|$|E

5000|$|The {{earliest}} known Irish Parliament met at Castledermot on 18 June 1264.
