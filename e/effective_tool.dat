5|$|The loggerhead {{sea turtle}} is omnivorous, feeding mainly on bottom-dwelling invertebrates. Its large and {{powerful}} jaws serve as an <b>effective</b> <b>tool</b> for dismantling its prey. Young loggerheads are exploited by numerous predators; the eggs are especially vulnerable to terrestrial organisms. Once the turtles reach adulthood, their formidable size limits predation to large marine animals, such as sharks.|$|E
5|$|Educator Daniel Challener, in his 1997 book Stories of Resilience in Childhood, {{analyzed}} {{the events in}} Caged Bird to illustrate resiliency in children. Challener states that Angelou's book provides a useful framework for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya face and how a community helps these children succeed as Angelou did. Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has used Caged Bird to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of child development topics such as the development of self-concept and self-esteem, ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, puberty, and identity formation in adolescence. He has called the book a highly <b>effective</b> <b>tool</b> for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts.|$|E
5|$|Pomeranians are {{typically}} friendly, playful and lively; {{but they can}} be aggressive with other dogs to try to prove themselves. Pomeranians are alert and aware of changes in their environment, and barking at new stimuli can develop into a habit of barking excessively in any situation. They are somewhat defensive of their territory and thus may bark when they hear outside noises. Pomeranians are intelligent, respond well to training, and can be very successful in getting what they want from their owners. They are extroverted and enjoy being the center of attention, {{but they can be}}come dominant if not well trained and socialized. The use of toys can be an <b>effective</b> <b>tool</b> in training Pomeranians to spend time alone.|$|E

5|$|Waller mustered his men in Farnham Park near 10:30p.m., on 12 December. At around midnight, 5,000 of Waller's men marched {{west from}} Farnham toward Basing House. The Parliamentarians marched {{about two miles}} in this {{direction}} (in order to confuse Royalist scouts), until around 1:00a.m., before abruptly turning south toward Alton. The march was quick and quiet, owing to a long frost which had hardened the roads and Waller's judicious use of wooded areas. Also helpful in Waller's advance was his use of leather guns, here employed {{for the first time}} in the English Civil War. Unlike heavier artillery, a leather gun could be led by a single horse, transported efficiently over difficult terrain, and still be an <b>effective</b> <b>tool</b> for bombardment.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} {{positively}} received by reviewers. The prose {{has been called}} magnificent, lucid, eloquent, and passionate. Lewis' emotional appeal has been called remarkably candid, sincere, powerful, and moving. Connecting the diplomatic and policy-level work of the UN and World Bank with specific effects {{on the ground in}} Africa, and describing the problem of orphans, were among the strengths of the book. Lewis' criticisms are constructive and, since they come from such an ardent multilateralist employed by the United Nations, authoritative. One reviewer questioned several of Lewis' potential solutions as contributing to the same system that consistently fails to address its flaws. The same reviewer identified as the book's weakness its political slant, which ignores corrupt or inefficient African governments and the realities of asking corporations and western governments to take steps against their self-interest, like canceling agricultural subsidies in the case of governments and donating profits in the case of businesses. Several reviewers noted that the book could be used as an <b>effective</b> <b>tool</b> to educate about the HIV/AIDS crisis and the plight of the people of sub-Saharan Africa.|$|E

25|$|QDMR (Quantitative Differentially Methylated Regions) is a {{quantitative}} approach to quantify methylation difference and identify DMRs from genome-wide methylation profiles by adapting Shannon entropy /bioinfo.hrbmu.edu.cn/qdmr>. The platform-free and species-free nature of QDMR makes it potentially applicable to various methylation data. This approach provides an <b>effective</b> <b>tool</b> for the high-throughput {{identification of the}} functional regions involved in epigenetic regulation. QDMR {{can be used as}} an <b>effective</b> <b>tool</b> for the quantification of methylation difference and identification of DMRs across multiple samples.|$|E

25|$|MPAs {{can be an}} <b>effective</b> <b>tool</b> to {{maintain}} fish populations. The general concept is to create overpopulation within the MPA. The fish expand into the surrounding areas to reduce crowding, increasing the population of unprotected areas. This helps support local fisheries in the surrounding area, while maintaining a healthy population within the MPA. Such MPAs are most commonly used for coral reef ecosystems.|$|E
25|$|The {{logistic}} {{growth equation}} is an <b>effective</b> <b>tool</b> for modelling intraspecific competition despite its simplicity, {{and has been}} used to model many real biological systems. At low population densities, N(t) is much smaller than K and so the may determinant for population growth is just the per capita growth rate. However, as N(t) approaches the carrying capacity the second term in the logistic equation becomes smaller, reducing the rate of change of population density.|$|E
25|$|Coral aquaculture, {{also known}} as coral farming or coral gardening, is showing promise as a {{potentially}} <b>effective</b> <b>tool</b> for restoring coral reefs, which have been declining around the world. The process bypasses the early growth stages of corals when they are most at risk of dying. Coral seeds are grown in nurseries, then replanted on the reef. Coral is farmed by coral farmers who live locally to the reefs and farm for reef conservation or for income.|$|E

PRC-based Internet sites remain a leading source of Chinese-language and China-related news for overseas Chinese.

25|$|Although some archaeologists {{consider}} {{the use of}} metal detectors to be tantamount to treasure hunting, others deem them an <b>effective</b> <b>tool</b> in archaeological surveying. Examples of formal archaeological use of metal detectors include musketball distribution analysis on English Civil War battlefields, metal distribution analysis prior to excavation of a 19th-century ship wreck, and service cable location during evaluation. Metal detectorists have also contributed to archaeology where they have made detailed records of their results and refrained from raising artifacts from their archaeological context. In the UK, metal detectorists have been solicited for involvement in the Portable Antiquities Scheme.|$|E
25|$|Music {{has been}} found to be an <b>effective</b> <b>tool</b> for music {{therapists}} through extensive research. It is beneficial for any individual, both physically and mentally, through improved heart rate, reduced anxiety, stimulation of the brain, and improved learning. Music therapists use their techniques to help their patients in many areas, ranging from stress relief before and after surgeries, to neuropathologies such as Alzheimer's disease. One study found that children who listened to music while having an IV inserted into their arms showed less distress and felt less pain than the children who did not listen to music while having an IV inserted.|$|E
