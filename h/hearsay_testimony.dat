Generally, the girlfriend's statements to the police would be inadmissible as out-of-court <b>hearsay,</b> but the <b>testimony</b> was admitted due to {{an exception to the}} hearsay rule which allows the admission of out-of-court statements by a witness when the defendant has made that witness unavailable to testify in court.

40|$|In {{response}} to an article previously published in the Florida Law Review by Professor Ben Trachtenberg, I argue that the historical thesis of Crawford v.

I argue that this is an appropriate limit on the Clause, and that in fact for the most part there is no good reason to exclude nontestimonial <b>hearsay</b> if live <b>testimony</b> by the declarant to the same proposition would be admissible. I further suggest that the prevailing law of evidence is consistent with this approach to a significant degree, because the doctrine is much more receptive to nontestimonial hearsay than to testimonial hearsay. In contrast to Professor Trachtenberg, I am not troubled by the fact that this approach would probably not block admissibility of one of the notable statements in the trial of Walter Raleigh, or {{by the fact that the}} approach supports the willingness of some courts to admit evidence of statements made in support of lawful joint ventures. I conclude by offering some suggestions as to how hearsay doctrine might be transformed to reflect the principles advocated in this Essay...|$|R

40|$|In December 2012, the Florida Law Review {{published}} Ben Trachtenberg’s article “Confronting Coventurers: Coconspirator Hearsay, Sir Walter Raleigh, and the Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause,” 64 Fla. L. Rev. 1669 (2012). Using {{the example}} of hearsay admitted in criminal prosecutions related to the Holy Land Foundation, the article argued that under Crawford v. Washington, courts had begun admitting unreliable hearsay against criminal defendants that previously would have been barred under Ohio v. Roberts, the Confrontation Clause case upended by Crawford. Richard D. Friedman, the Alene and Allan F. Smith Professor of Law at the University of Michigan, responded in “The Mold that Shapes Hearsay Law,” 66 Fla. L. Rev. 433 (2014). Professor Friedman vigorously defended the concept of “testimonial” hearsay set forth in Crawford and argued further {{that for the most}} part there is no good reason to exclude nontestimonial <b>hearsay</b> if live <b>testimony</b> by the declarant to the same proposition would be admissible. This essay, published along with that of Professor Friedman, continues the debate. After briefly revisiting the criticism of Crawford’s historical basis - and noting the questionable “originalist” support for the Confrontation Clause doctrine - this essay argues that the Court’s Sixth Amendment jurisprudence should be judged by its works. Because a majority of Justices has been unable to present a coherent definition of “testimonial,” evaluating the Crawford decision remains difficult a decade after its issuance. Nonetheless, it is becoming clear that a sensible Confrontation Clause doctrine will concern itself with the reliability of evidence admitted against criminal defendants. The success of subsequent efforts to define the right of a defendant “to be confronted with the witnesses against him” will depend, at least in part, on the answer to these questions: Does the doctrine admit reliable evidence? Does it exclude unreliable evidence...|$|R
40|$|James v. Illinois permits illegally-obtained {{evidence}} to impeach defendants, but not defense witnesses. Thus far, all courts have construed James to allow impeachment of defendants 2 ̆ 7 hearsay declarations. This article argues against allowing illegally-obtained {{evidence to}} impeach defendants 2 ̆ 7 hearsay declarations because doing so unduly diminishes the exclusionary rule 2 ̆ 7 s deterrent effect. The distinction between impeaching defendants and defense witnesses disappears when courts allow prosecutors to impeach defendants 2 ̆ 7 hearsay declarations. Because defense witnesses report exculpatory conduct of a defendant who {{always has a}} substantial interest in disguising his criminality, their testimony routinely incorporates defendant <b>hearsay.</b> Defense witness <b>testimony</b> thus routinely paves the way for illegally-obtained evidence, contradicting James 2 ̆ 7 s intention that substantial deterrence result from prohibiting impeachment of defense witnesses. Moreover, in the few cases finding that defense witnesses 2 ̆ 7 testimony did not invite illegally-obtained evidence by incorporating defendant hearsay, prosecutors overlooked winning evidentiary arguments or the courts made evidentiary errors. The unpredictable nature of these instances of exclusion adds insult to injury: Because competent defense counsel will refrain from calling a defense witness rather than hope for prosecutorial neglect or judicial error, the prosecution benefits from its illegally-obtained proof, eliminating the deterrence James contemplates. Meanwhile, less than competent counsel will stumble into calling defense witnesses and occasionally {{reap the benefits of}} prosecutorial neglect or judicial error when illegally-obtained evidence is not admitted despite its impeaching effect on defendant hearsay. Thus, the status quo imposes costs to the truth without any compensating deterrence of constitutional violations. By comparison, flipping a coin to decide whether prosecutors can use suppressed evidence to impeach would greatly improve matters. It assures that a limited impeachment exception engenders at least some additional deterrence beyond that already provided by suppression on the prosecution 2 ̆ 7 s case in chief to justify its truth seeking costs. Flipping a coin is hardly an acceptable solution. Nonetheless, that it improves the status quo vividly illustrates the error of applying the exception to impeach defendant hearsay and the futility of pursuing an impeachment exception whose parameters purport to promote accurate fact finding without undermining the exclusionary rule 2 ̆ 7 s deterrence of constitutional violations...|$|R
40|$|Policy Question: How {{should the}} United States Government (“USG”) prosecute the ISIL leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (“ABAB”), if it captures him? 	Overall Recommendations: 1) 	The USG should {{consider}} the empirically proven benefits of capturing terrorist leaders rather killing than them. Both the scholarship discussed in Part III and the independent statistical analysis discussed in Appendix A shows the empiricism behind the benefits. The empirical evidence suggests decapitation hastens the demise of terror groups, but that “capture” decapitation strategies do so more than “kill” strategies. The intuitive rationale is that capture yields intelligence from interrogation and prosecution renders a strategic communications impact {{of the rule of}} law. 2) 	The USG should only opt for a capture / prosecute strategy once it has sufficient admissible evidence to secure a conviction. This calculation must be made for whichever court policymakers intend to try him. Different courts have different rules of evidence and pose different practical and procedural hurdles to bringing evidence before a judge and jury. If the USG can link ABAB to ISIL’s crimes only through classified documents and source-protected witnesses, then prosecutors may not have sufficient evidence to convict without that information. This dilemma is more problematic the more “international” the prosecution becomes. US prosecution confronts its own evidentiary problems, such as the rule against hearsay. 3) 	The USG should attempt to capture as many ISIL members in the top echelon as possible. Beyond the obvious value of dealing more damage to ISIL, capturing a larger group of ISIL leaders than just ABAB serves two purposes. First, prosecuting a leader of a criminal organization is uniquely difficult. Prosecutors must link the actions of the leader to the crimes of the organization; testimony to that linkage becomes critical. While accomplices have loyalty to a leader, they still reveal information under interrogation and are often willing to testify to save themselves from a harsher sentence. Having witnesses with first-hand knowledge of ABAB’s directives is particularly important for US prosecution, because the rule against <b>hearsay</b> bars second-hand <b>testimony.</b> Second, more detainees increases the achievability of the non-US prosecution options. Creating an international tribunal or hybrid court, or investing in an International Criminal Court inquiry, is more feasible if prosecutors will have a docket replete with defendants, rather than a sole offender...|$|R

50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} of the rules of evidence is that, in general, <b>hearsay</b> <b>testimony</b> is inadmissible (although there are many exceptions to this rule). In the United Kingdom, the Civil Evidence Act 1995, section 1, specifically allows for admission of 'hearsay' evidence; legislation also allows for 'hearsay' evidence to be used in criminal proceedings, which makes it possible for the accuser to induce friends or family to give false evidence in support of their accusations because, normally, it would be rejected by the presiding authority or judge. There are several examples where presiding authorities are not bound by the rules of evidence. These include the military tribunals in the United States and tribunals used in Australia to try health professionals.|$|E

Transcripts were based on actual child sexual abuse interviews (one 4 and one 8 -year-old female) obtained for prior research with permission from Child Protective Services officials.

40|$|In {{cases of}} {{potential}} child abuse, parents may provide <b>hearsay</b> <b>testimony</b> {{on behalf of}} a child, retelling events from the child’s perspective.

In order to gain a better understanding of parental hearsay, parents’ descriptions of information children provided in recorded parent-child discussions were compared to the actual information the children provided in the initial discussion and in a 1 -week follow-up interview. Children interviewed by parents were also compared to children interviewed by a trained interviewer. To date, 11 children between the ages of 6 - 9 years have been assessed.

40|$|The Sixth Amendment {{guarantees}} {{a criminal}} defendant {{the right to}} confront the witnesses against her. This right to confrontation, known as the Confrontation Clause, applies to <b>hearsay</b> <b>testimony.</b> Therefore, even if a hearsay statement is admissible pursuant to the Federal Rules of Evidence, the Sixth Amendment may prohibit its admission. Whether hearsay runs afoul of the Confrontation Clause depends on whether that hearsay is “testimonial” in nature. However, the Supreme Court has refused to define “testimonial. ” Furthermore, what little guidance the Court has released about the correct interpretation of “testimonial” is fractured, conflicting, and confusing. This is especially troubling with respect to forensic hearsay documents because of their importance in criminal trials {{as well as their}} ubiquity and variety. Chief among these problematic documents is the autopsy report—an integral and controversial incarnation of forensic hearsay. Due to splits at the state and federal levels regarding the correct interpretation of this rule with respect to autopsy reports, as well as the high-stakes nature of its answer, this Comment argues that it is likely the Court will eventually consider the issue.

40|$|Under {{the general}} American rule utterances {{revealing}} {{present state of}} mind are admissible to prove the speaker 2 ̆ 7 s state of mind before, after, or at time of speaking. The orthodox reason for the rule is well stated by Wigmore 2 ̆ 2... the judicial doctrine has been {{that there is a}} fair necessity, for lack of better evidence, for resorting to a person 2 ̆ 7 s own contemporary statements of his mental or physical condition.
