The technical terminology for identify differs {{a great deal from}} one school of linguistics to another. The most widespread term is probably refer, and a thing identified is a referent, as for example in the work of John Lyons. In linguistics, the study of reference relations belongs to pragmatics, the study of language use, though it is also a matter of great interest to philosophers, especially those wishing {{to understand the nature of}} knowledge, perception and cognition more generally.|$|E

As a consequence, they provide a uniform access to the extensional and the intensional parts of the objectoriented database. The proposed operations are used for inquiring about the associations among <b>individual</b> <b>objects,</b> the relationships between <b>individual</b> <b>objects</b> and class objects, and the relationships among the class objects themselves. We show that if they are integrated into an object algebra, they can serve for querying the intensional portion of the database, and for using the relationships between <b>individual</b> <b>objects</b> and the conceptual schema in conventional queries. 1 Introduction In an object-oriented (OO) [...] ...|$|R

2500|$|From 1626 on wards, Van der Hamen {{made his}} still lifes more varied and complex than his early ones by placing objects on {{different}} levels. This type of composition {{seems to have}} originated in Rome during the early 1620s and is seen in works attributed to Tomasso Salini and Agostino Verrocchi. However, van der Hamen's use of this scheme {{differs from that of}} the Roman painters, who liked to scatter a profusion of inanimate objects over the surface. Van der Hamen drastically reduces the number of elements and arranges the remainder into exquisitely balanced, asymmetrical compositions, strongly lit in the Spanish manner. This allows him to concentrate on the rendering of each <b>individual</b> <b>object</b> and thus to enhance the sensation of corporeality and texture.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{many other}} {{aesthetic}} theories, Schopenhauer's {{centers on the}} concept of genius. Genius, according to Schopenhauer, is possessed by all people in varying degrees and consists of the capacity for aesthetic experience. An aesthetic experience occurs when an individual perceives an object and understands by it not the <b>individual</b> <b>object</b> itself, but the Platonic form of the object. The individual is then able to lose himself in the object of contemplation and, for a brief moment, escape the cycle of unfulfilled desire by becoming [...] "the pure subject of will-less knowing". Those who have a high degree of genius can be taught to communicate these aesthetic experiences to others, and objects that communicate these experiences are works of art. Based on this theory, Schopenhauer viewed Dutch still-life as the best type of painting, because it was able to help viewers see beauty in ordinary, everyday objects. However, he sharply criticized depictions of nude women and prepared food, as these stimulate desire and thus hinder the viewer from the aesthetic experience and becoming [...] "the pure subject of will-less knowing".|$|E

2500|$|For Schopenhauer, human desiring, [...] "willing", and craving cause {{suffering}} or pain. A temporary way {{to escape}} this pain is through aesthetic contemplation (a method comparable to Zapffe's [...] "Sublimation"). Aesthetic contemplation allows one to escape this pain—albeit temporarily—because it stops one perceiving the world as mere presentation. Instead, one no longer perceives the world {{as an object of}} perception (therefore as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds; time, space and causality) from which one is separated; rather one becomes one with that perception: [...] "one can thus no longer separate the perceiver from the perception" [...] (The World as Will and Representation, section 34). From this immersion with the world one no longer views oneself as an individual who suffers in the world due to one's individual will but, rather, becomes a [...] "subject of cognition" [...] to a perception that is [...] "Pure, will-less, timeless" [...] (section 34) where the essence, [...] "ideas", of the world are shown. Art is the practical consequence of this brief aesthetic contemplation as it attempts to depict one's immersion with the world, thus tries to depict the essence/pure ideas of the world. Music, for Schopenhauer, was the purest form of art because it was the one that depicted the will itself without it appearing as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds, therefore as an <b>individual</b> <b>object.</b> According to Daniel Albright, [...] "Schopenhauer thought that music was the only art that did not merely copy ideas, but actually embodied the will itself".|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} assess not only the type but also the {{severity}} of neglect, doctors employ a variety of tests, {{most of which are}} carried out at the patient's bedside. Perhaps one of the most-used and quickest is the line bisection. In this test, a line a few inches long is drawn {{on a piece of paper}} and the patient is then asked to dissect the line at the midpoint. Patients exhibiting, for example, left-sided neglect will exhibit a rightward deviation of the line's true midpoint. Another widely used test is the line cancellation test. Here a patient is presented with a piece of paper that has various lines scattered across it and is asked to mark each of the lines. Patients who exhibit left-sided neglect will completely ignore all lines on the left side of the paper. Visual neglect can also be assessed by having the patient draw a copy of a picture with which they are presented. If the patient is asked to draw a complex picture they may neglect the entire contralesional side of the picture. If asked to draw an <b>individual</b> <b>object,</b> the patient will not draw the contralesional side of that object. A patient may also be asked to read a page out of a book. The patient will be unable to orient their eyes to the left margin and will begin reading the page from the center. Presenting a single word to a patient will result in the patient either reading only the ipsilesional part of the word or replacing the part they cannot see with a logical substitute. For example, if they are presented with the word [...] "peanut", they may read [...] "nut" [...] or say [...] "walnut".|$|E
60|$|This is a {{very limited}} view of the {{function}} of general names. Even {{if there were a}} name for every <b>individual</b> <b>object,</b> we should require general names as much as we now do. Without them we could not express the result of a single comparison, nor record any one of the uniformities existing in nature; and should be hardly better off in respect to Induction than if we had no names at all. With none but names of individuals (or, in other words, proper names), we might, by pronouncing the name, suggest the idea of the object, but we could not assert any proposition; except the unmeaning ones formed by predicating two proper names one of another. It is only by means of general names that we can convey any information, predicate any attribute, even of an individual, much more of a class. Rigorously speaking, we could get on without any other general names than the abstract names of attributes; all our propositions might be of the form “such an <b>individual</b> <b>object</b> possesses such an attribute,” or “such an attribute is always (or never) conjoined with such another attribute.” In fact, however, mankind have always given general names to objects as well as attributes, and indeed before attributes: but the general names given to objects imply attributes, derive their whole meaning from attributes; and are chiefly useful as the language by means of which we predicate the attributes which they connote.|$|E

6000|$|... § 4. Let the {{predicate}} be, {{as we have}} said, a connotative term; and to {{take the}} simplest case first, let the subject be a proper name: “The summit of Chimborazo is white.” The word white connotes an attribute which is possessed by the <b>individual</b> <b>object</b> designated by the words “summit of Chimborazo;” which attribute consists in the physical fact, of its exciting in human beings the sensation which we call a sensation of white. It will be admitted that, by asserting the proposition, we wish to communicate information of that physical fact, and are not thinking of the names, except as the necessary means of making that communication. The meaning of the proposition, therefore, is, that the individual thing denoted by the subject, has the attributes connoted by the predicate.|$|E

But then it was a general romance, and not one with an <b>individual</b> <b>object.</b> Or perhaps we may say, without injury to Mr. Somers, that it was a true feeling, and not a false one. Mr. Prendergast, also, was much more anxious for the welfare of Herbert Fitzgerald than that of his cousin; but then he could feel on behalf of the man for whom he was interested that it did not behove him to take a present of an estate from the hands of the true owner.|$|E

We put a mark, not indeed upon the object itself, but, so to speak, upon {{the idea of the}} object. A proper name is but an unmeaning mark which we connect in our minds with the idea of the object, in order that whenever the mark meets our eyes or occurs to our thoughts, we may think of that <b>individual</b> <b>object.</b> Not being attached to the thing itself, it does not, like the chalk, enable us to distinguish the object when we see it; but it enables us to distinguish it when it is spoken of, either in the records of our own experience, or in the discourse of others; to know that what we find asserted in any proposition of which it is the subject, is asserted of the individual thing with which we were previously acquainted.|$|E
6000|$|... 238. Fourthly, {{when the}} general energy, instead of pervading {{simultaneously}} {{the multitude of}} objects, as with one spirit, is independently possessed and manifested by every <b>individual</b> <b>object,</b> the result is repetition, not unity; and contrast is not merely agreeable, but necessary. Thus, a number of objects, forming the line of beauty, is pervaded by one simple energy; but if that energy is separately manifested in each, the result is painful monotony. Parallel right lines, without grouping, are always liable to this objection; and, therefore, a distant view of a flat country is never beautiful unless its horizontals are lost in richness of vegetation, as in Lombardy, or broken with masses of forest, or with distant hills. If none of these interruptions take place, there is immediate monotony, and no introduction can be more delightful than such a tower in the distance as Strasburg, or, indeed, than any architectural combination of verticals. Peterborough is a beautiful instance of such an adaptation. It is always, then, to be remembered that repetition is not assimilation.|$|E
