5|$|As Ophelia was {{predicted}} to pass near southeast New England, the NHC issued tropical storm warnings {{for much of}} the south Massachusetts and Rhode Island coastlines. In Atlantic Canada, considerable preparations were taken for Ophelia, primarily because of memories of Hurricane Juan of the 2003 season, which <b>had</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> authorities off-guard. Ophelia prompted the Canadian Hurricane Centre's first ever tropical storm warnings which were canceled when Ophelia became extratropical.|$|E

He was invited to Balmoral Castle, where King Edward VII promoted him a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO).|$|E
5|$|At his 1st dan judo examination, Abbe <b>had</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> {{attention}} of Shotaro Tobata from the Butoku Kai, {{who had been}} refereeing at the event. Tobata had suggested to Nakamoto and Abbe {{that the young man}} should apply for entry to the renowned Budo Senmon Gakko (abbreviated to 'Busen,' and sometimes referred to as 'Busen College'), a specialist college for martial artists. With the additional help of a teacher named Nakano, Abbe now prepared for the entrance examination in Kyoto. Out of all the candidates, of which there were around 300 that year, 20 would be accepted into the judo programme and 20 into the kendo programme. Abbe performed well and was accepted into both programmes.|$|E

5|$|While the {{painting}} {{has been described}} as showing the story of an ancestral being called Lungkata starting the first bushfire, it portrays elements of nine distinct dreamings, of which Lungkata's tale is the central motif. Lungkata was the Bluetongue Lizard Man, an ancestral figure responsible for creating bushfire. The painting portrays the results of a fire, caused by Lungkata to punish his two sons who did not share with their father the kangaroo they <b>had</b> <b>caught.</b> <b>The</b> sons' skeletons are on the right hand side of the image, shown against a background representing smoke and ashes.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the Ministry of Defence (Mindef) {{acquired}} the land containing the spring {{for the expansion}} of the nearby Sembawang Air Base, leaving F with less than 4 hectares (10 acres) of land. Its water-bottling plant survived until the early 1990s however. In January 2002, locals' interest to the hot spring, which <b>had</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> attention of Singaporeans after the surrounding land had been cleared to begin the RSAF air base extension. Sembawang community leaders gathered signatures to petition Mindef, which was going to fence off the area, to preserve and develop the hot spring for the general public. Mindef gave the green light to the appeals and opened a small side gate pavement for the public to access the spring.|$|E
5|$|Mark Teixeira {{tied the}} game with a solo home run in the fourth inning, and Hideki Matsui broke the tie in the sixth with another solo homer. Martínez {{departed}} the game after giving up consecutive hits to Jerry Hairston, Jr. and Melky Cabrera to start the seventh inning, and reliever Chan Ho Park gave up an RBI single to Jorge Posada. With Cabrera at second base and Posada at first, Johnny Damon hit a low line drive at Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard. Howard grabbed the ball and threw to second where Posada was tagged and called out while standing on the base. First-base umpire Brian Gorman ruled that Howard <b>had</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> ball in the air and thus the result was an inning-ending double play. This was the first of two calls by Gorman in this game which were later shown to have been wrong by video replays.|$|E

5|$|The breakaway's {{lead was}} reduced to {{less than two minutes}} {{at the foot of the}} first climb. Howes {{attacked}} alone, with Madrazo following. On the descent, however, Howes fell. He was passed by Madrazo and by the peloton, which <b>had</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> remainder of the breakaway. On the flat section that followed the climb, several groups, including that of Chaves, came back together. Niki Terpstra (Etixx-Quick Step) attacked, but was soon caught and passed by his teammate Gianluca Brambilla, who was part of a four-man group that formed on the final ascent of the day. Tom Dumoulin attempted to control the peloton on the climb, but there were attacks from various riders including some of the general classification favourites. After the descent, the groups came back together and the lead group was formed of approximately 40 riders.|$|E

Most survived, including the admiral. A memorial was erected by the crew of HMS Hannibal in memory of their shipmates.|$|E
25|$|The {{programme}} featured Professor Cyril E. M.

The programme first aired under the title Any Questions? and drew a small audience and few questions. However, {{within a few weeks}} it <b>had</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> zeitgeist of the nation, gaining an audience of 11½million. The series was extended from a run of 12 episodes into an open-ended series that ran into the 1950s.|$|E

25|$|As {{thousands}} of settlers poured into Iowa in the mid-19th century, all {{shared a common}} concern {{for the development of}} adequate transportation. The earliest settlers shipped their agricultural goods down the Mississippi River to New Orleans, Louisiana. Steamboats were in widespread use on the Mississippi and major rivers by the 1850s. In the 1850s, Iowans <b>had</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> nation's railroad fever. By 1860, Chicago, Illinois was served by almost a dozen lines and had become the regional hub. Iowans, like other Midwesterners, were anxious to start railroad building in their state.|$|E

For this play she began using the professional name of Anna Neagle (the surname being her mother's maiden name). The play was a success with a total run of 604 performances. Stand Up and Sing provided her big break when film producer and director Herbert Wilcox, who <b>had</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> show purposely to consider Buchanan for an upcoming film, but also took note of her cinematic potential.|$|E
25|$|The ball {{came very}} close to hitting the ground before Harris scooped it up. In the {{sideline}} views of both film and video, Harris <b>had</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> ball out of frame, and came running into frame from the right side on his path to the end zone. The only other known NBC video was an end zone shot from above and behind the goalposts depicting Harris scooping the ball before it touched the ground. The best NFL Films shot of the play, from ground level, is a tight shot from the end zone of Harris snaring the ball, with his feet and the ground just out of frame below.|$|E

25|$|The {{threat of}} the Twins moving to St. Paul <b>had</b> <b>caught</b> <b>the</b> {{attention}} {{of the business community}} in Minneapolis, which, up to this point, had been largely silent on the issue. During the run-up to the St. Paul referendum in 1999, an independent working group was formed by Minneapolis businessmen Bruce Lambrecht and Rich Pogin, representatives of a group of investors which owned the Rapid Park parking lot in the historic warehouse district on the northern edge of downtown Minneapolis. This group, initially known as Minnesota Urban Ballpark, and later as MN Twinsville, formed with the express purpose of bringing their land into the discussion about sites for a new Twins ballpark.|$|E

That was how it looked to Ikin, to some of the other English players and some of the crowd, and that was how it looked to me sitting {{watching}} from the dressing room. Bradman, however, thought it was a bump ball and he stayed, as he was fully entitled to do if there was any doubt in his mind... the umpire gave him not out and he went on to make 187 of Australia's total of 645.|$|E

Whilst recovering, Findlater received a large number of public donations, including sets of bagpipes, and by at least one account, a proposal of marriage. The public interest increased sharply after he was awarded the Victoria Cross, and to supplement his Army pension Findlater arranged to appear at the Military Tournament, where he drew large crowds; for just thirty performances, he was paid two-thirds as much as his annual Army pension of £46. He then began to perform at music halls, first at the London Alhambra and then nationally, with his earnings climbing as high as £100 a week.|$|E
