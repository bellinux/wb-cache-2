50|$|<b>Green</b> <b>{{accounting}}</b> {{is a type}} {{of accounting}} that attempts to factor environmental costs into the financial results of operations. It has been argued that gross domestic product ignores the environment and therefore policymakers need a revised model that incorporates <b>green</b> <b>accounting.</b> The major purpose of <b>green</b> <b>accounting</b> is to help businesses understand and manage the potential quid pro quo between traditional economics goals and environmental goals. It also increases the important information available for analyzing policy issues, especially when those vital pieces of information are often overlooked. <b>Green</b> <b>accounting</b> is said to only ensure weak sustainability, which should be considered as a step toward ultimately a strong sustainability.|$|E

40|$|In Denmark, {{the first}} law on <b>Green</b> <b>Accounts</b> {{was passed in}} July 1995. This law {{instructed}} a se-lected part of the Danish companies to prepare a <b>Green</b> <b>Account</b> containing general information about the company, {{a statement from the}} management and a quantitative account of the environ-mental performance. However, in 1999 the official evaluation of the law showed that the expecta-tions to the <b>Green</b> <b>Accounts</b> were not fulfilled, and in 2002 the government strengthened the law. Among other new initiatives; the company should describe their environmental policy, goals and results- if any. In this paper the contents, effects and potentials of this new law will be discussed in relation to experiences with the first law, and a short overview of the general trends in environ-mental reporting will be given. This leads to some amendments of any future revision of the law – in consideration of both reaching a broader target group to expand the coverage of the reports, and to increase the communication value of the reports. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper is to {{demonstrate}} the usefulness of <b>Green</b> National <b>Accounting</b> by drawing out some interesting insights from the Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounts recently elaborated by the Institute for Advanced Development Studies for the case of Bolivia. The paper uses the <b>Green</b> National <b>Accounts</b> to show the importance of environmental inputs in 7 different productive sectors and compares the corresponding natural resource rents to the level of producer taxes in each sector. The paper also analyses the evolution of total productive capital, in order to judge whether Bolivia’s current development model can be considered sustainable.

40|$|Summary and {{introduction}} The present <b>Green</b> <b>Account</b> contains relevant {{environmental data}} and report consumptions {{of energy and}} water for DTU Environment for year 2010. <b>Green</b> <b>accounts</b> have been compiled in different forms at DTU Environment since 2005. Historical trends are here presented to document the efficacy of solutions implemented to improve the environmental footprint of the department. The <b>Green</b> <b>Account</b> 2010 was prepared by Alessio Boldrin and Anders Torp Gundersen {{with the support of}} the CO 2 reduction group. It was found that consumption of electricity is similar to the 2009 level (Figure 1). On the other hand, heat and water consumption have increased compared to 2009. The increase in heat consumption is very related to the cold winter months (January-February, October-Dicember) in 2010, while no precise explanation could be found for increased water consumption. Emissions of CO 2 related to activities at DTU ENV have increase in 2010 (Table 1). Compared to the period 2006 - 2009, emissions increased because of heat consumption and more business travelling. ENV employees were travelling almost 50 % more on intercontinental routes in 2010 compared to 2009. On the other hand, in 2010 there was a relevant decrease of continental flights in Europe, being replaced by an increasing number of long-distance train connections...|$|R

40|$|Although {{sustainable}} {{development has been}} interpreted primarily as a national (or global) goal, there is increasing discussion of the 'sustainable city', the 'sustainable sector' and the 'sustainable business'. In this paper, the notion of corporate sustainability is explored and developed. We argue {{that one of the}} keys to understanding corporate sustainability is full cost accounting, that is, valuing pollution in corporate <b>green</b> <b>accounts.</b> Defining and measuring corporate sustainability is more than just an academic concern. Corporate entities are increasingly under pressure to demonstrate how they contribute to the national sustainability goals outlined by government. Hence, this paper seeks to provide practical advice on how businesses might adapt and improve current environmental accounting and reporting practice. ...|$|R
50|$|Working with Nicholas Muller, {{this model}} has been {{recently}} been extended to cover all air pollution sources in the United States. The research identifies which sources are causing the greatest damages. By comparing costs and benefits, air pollution regulators can improve the efficiency of current policies by recognizing the importance of location and matching marginal costs to marginal damages. New regulations can be designed {{to be far more}} efficient at reducing damages compared to current approaches including cap and trade. Along with William Nordhaus, the model has also been used to construct a <b>green</b> <b>account</b> that measure the role each industry plays in generating air pollution damages and compares these damages to their net value added.|$|R

The findings, released in the China <b>Green</b> National <b>Accounting</b> Study Report 2004 in 2006, reported that environmental pollution cost the economy 511.8 billion yuan or 3.5% of GDP in 2004. A breakdown of the figure shows that water pollution, air pollution, and solid waste and accidents cost 286.28 billion yuan, 219.8 billion yuan, and 5.74 billion yuan, respectively. According to the report, only about ten of the items the project intended to distinguish were accounted for.

These initial results released in 1994 showed that GDP numbers were overstating the impact of mining companies to the nation's economic wealth. Mining companies didn't like those results, and in 1995 Alan B.

50|$|During the {{construction}} of the NSLS, two scientists, Renate Chasman and George Kenneth Green, invented a special periodic arrangement of magnetic elements (a magnetic lattice) to provide optimized bending and focusing of electrons. The design was called the Chasman-Green lattice, and it became the basis of design for every synchrotron storage ring. Storage rings are characterized by the number of straight sections and bend sections in their design. The bend sections produce more light than the straight sections due to the change in angular momentum of the electrons. Chasman and <b>Green</b> <b>accounted</b> for this in their design by adding insertion devices, known as wigglers and undulators, in the straight sections of the storage ring. These insertion devices produce the brightest light among the sections of the ring and thus, beamlines are typically built downstream from them.|$|R
