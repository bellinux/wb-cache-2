5|$|On his death-bed, Josquin {{asked that}} he be listed on the rolls as a foreigner, so that his {{property}} would not pass to the Lords and Ladies of Condé. This bit of evidence {{has been used to}} show that he was French by birth. Additionally, he left an endowment for the performance of his late motet, Pater noster, at all general processions in the town when they passed in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>house,</b> stopping to place a wafer on the marketplace altar to the Holy Virgin. Pater noster may have been his last work.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} shot on {{location}} over 24 days in Los Angeles, {{with a budget}} of $8 million. It was filmed by cinematographer Xavier Pérez Grobet, with whom Holofcener had previously worked on the HBO television series Enlightened. Although each scene was scripted, the actors would often ad-lib lines of dialogue. The final scene of the film, in which Eva and Albert reunite in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>house,</b> was improvised by Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini. It was edited by Robert Frazen, Holofcener's boyfriend at the time, who had also worked on all four of her previous films.|$|E

25|$|For months, Allende {{had feared}} calling upon the Carabineros ("Carabineers", the {{national}} police force), suspecting them of disloyalty to his government. On 9 August, President Allende appointed General Carlos Prats as Minister of Defence. On 24 August 1973, General Prats {{was forced to resign}} both as defense minister and as the commander-in-chief of the army, embarrassed by both the Alejandrina Cox incident and a public protest in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>house</b> by the wives of his generals. General Augusto Pinochet replaced him as Army commander-in-chief the same day.|$|E
25|$|The baggy green cap was {{originally}} supplied to the player {{as part of}} a kit of equipment, and a new one was routinely issued for each tour, with the year number on it. In fact, a few former Australian players have been known to use the cap for 'non-cricketing' purposes. Bill Lawry used the cap while cleaning his pigeon's nest, while Bill Ponsford was known to wear the cap to protect his hair while painting the fence in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>house.</b> Ian Chappell never kept any of his baggy green caps. In the early 1990s an unofficial practice emerged amongst test players never to replace a baggy green cap, most notably by Steve Waugh. Although there is no official rule against a player obtaining a replacement cap from Cricket Australia, this almost never occurs, and the increasingly dilapidated state of an aging baggy green cap is a de facto symbol of seniority amongst the players in the team.|$|E

Nerima serves as a backdrop for more martial arts mayhem with the introduction of Ranma's regular rivals, such as the eternally lost Ryoga Hibiki who traveled halfway across Japan getting from the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>house</b> to the back, where Ranma spent three days waiting for him. Ryoga, seeking revenge on Ranma, followed him to Jusenkyo where he ultimately falls into the Spring of Drown Piglet. Now when splashed with cold water he {{takes the form of a}} little black pig. Not knowing this, Akane takes the piglet as a pet and names it P-chan, but Ranma knows and hates him for keeping this secret and taking advantage of the situation. Another rival is the nearsighted Mousse, who also falls into a cursed spring and becomes a duck when he gets wet, and finally, there is Ranma's impish grandmaster, Happosai, who spends his time stealing the underwear of schoolgirls.|$|E
25|$|Farooq Ahmad Dar spread terror {{with his}} return from arms {{training}} in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in 1990s. He was imprisoned for killings of Kashmiri Hindus and had participated in their ethnic cleansing. The killings by him created a fear psychosis among the Kashmiri Pandits, leading to their mass-migration from Kashmir. His first victim was a young businessman Satish Kumar Tickoo, {{who was also a}} RSS member. Tickoo was shot by Dar in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>house.</b> Dar used to get orders (for execution) from Ishfaq Majid Wani or other superiors in JKLF. Dar would also walk armed on the streets of Srinagar in search of Kashmiri Pandits and on spotting, he would take out his pistol and shoot at them. He used pistols to kill individuals (civilians) and AK-47 to attack and fire at Indian Security Forces. He is accused of killing between at least 20 people to more than 30 Pandits in 1990 during the insurgency. The convener of Panun Kashmir has accused him of publicly proclaiming killing 42 Pandits. Dar himself had stated in a video that he had killed 20 Kashmiri Pandits. He however later claimed that he didn't kill any Pandit and the statement was made under duress.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{played a}} variety of sports in his youth, but {{considered}} baseball to be his favorite. He developed quick reflexes through various athletic and leisure activity, such as bouncing a ball off the concrete steps in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>house,</b> moving in closer to reduce reaction time with each throw. When not at the local YMCA or playing sports, Smith sometimes went with friends to the neighborhood lumberyard, springboarding off inner tubes and doing flips into sawdust piles (a precursor to his famous backflips). In 1965, at age ten, he endured the Watts Riots with his family, recalling that, [...] "We had {{to sleep on the}} floor because of all the sniping and looting going on." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1785, Benedict Arnold {{and his son}} Richard {{moved to}} Saint John, New Brunswick, where they speculated in land and {{established}} a business doing trade with the West Indies. [...] Arnold purchased large tracts {{of land in the}} Maugerville area, and acquired city lots in Saint John and Fredericton. Delivery of his first ship the Lord Sheffield was accompanied by accusations from the builder that Arnold had cheated him; Arnold claimed that he had merely deducted the contractually agreed amount when the ship was delivered late. After her first voyage, Arnold returned to London in 1786 to bring his family to Saint John. While there, he disentangled himself from a lawsuit over an unpaid debt that Peggy had been fighting while he was away, paying £900 to settle a £12,000 loan that he had taken while living in Philadelphia. The family moved to Saint John in 1787, where Arnold created an uproar with a series of bad business deals and petty lawsuits. The most serious of these was a slander suit which he won against a former business partner; and following this, townspeople burned him in effigy in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>house,</b> as Peggy and the children watched. The family left Saint John to return to London in December 1791.|$|E
