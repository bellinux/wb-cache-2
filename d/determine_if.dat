40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a formal model of {{computer}} security based on the universal Turing machine. This model allows us to conclude that given a machine and policy, the problem of <b>determining</b> <b>if</b> that machine is secure is not recursively enumerable. However, two related problems are solvable. The inverse problem of <b>determining</b> <b>if</b> a machine is insecure is recognizable. Additionally, <b>determining</b> <b>if</b> the current configuration of a machine is secure is decidable. Given these theoretical results, we propose a shift in how we discuss “security ” in practice. 1...|$|R

5|$|Abnormal genitalia: usually {{cryptorchidism}} (retention of testicles in body) or monorchism (single testicle).

5|$|An implant {{is tested}} between 8 and 24 weeks to <b>determine</b> <b>if</b> it is integrated.
