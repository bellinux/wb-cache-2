40|$|Force sensors are key {{elements}} of atomic force microscopes and surface profilometers. Sensors with an integrated <b>deflection</b> <b>meter</b> are particularly desirable. Here, quartz tuning forks as used in watches are utilized as force sensors. A novel technique is employed which simplifies {{the interpretation of the}} data and increases the imaging speed by at least one order of magnitude compared to previous implementations. The variation of the imaging signal with distance fits well to a Hertzian contact model.

40|$|Abstract — General {{methods of}} {{displacement}} measurement are to use LVDT, tiltmeter, or laser <b>deflection</b> <b>meter.</b> But these methods can’t be applied effectively if bridge height {{is so high}} that the installation of sensor is difficult. So the great part of in these cases, the reliability and accuracy of measured results are uncertain usually. To overcome this problem, in this paper, the two techniques for calculation of displacement from measured strain are proposed, the one is iteration of data averaging, {{and the other is}} lowpass filtering of measured strain. To verify these techniques, laboratory and field tests are carried out, and it is concluded that lowpass filtering technique is effective for calculating displacement by measured strain. Keywords—Displacement, Bridge, Monitoring, lowpass filter, Strain...|$|E

In this paper, we use a heterodyne method to observe the high-frequency behavior of circuits and devices by means of low-frequency lock-in temperature measurements. As experimental results, two applications of the technique are presented: detection of hot spots in ICs activated by high-frequency electrical signals and the {{observation of}} the frequency response of an integrated resistor through temperature measurements. The heterodyne method has been used in this paper with four different measurement techniques: embedded differential BiCMOS temperature sensor, laser reflectometer, laser interferometer and internal IR laser <b>deflection</b> <b>meter...</b>|$|E

By slicing a worm into separate segments, and attaching each segment to a sensitive voltmeter, he noticed distinct, consecutive <b>deflections</b> on the <b>meter</b> which demonstrated a potential wave moving through the severed parts from the front {{to the end of}} the entire cut-up specimen at approximately the speed of a contraction wave of a wriggling earthworm.|$|R
2500|$|To measure resistance, {{switches}} {{arrange for}} a small battery within the instrument to pass a current through the device under test and the meter coil. Since the current available depends {{on the state of}} charge of the battery which changes over time, a multimeter usually has an adjustment for the ohms scale to zero it. In the usual circuits found in analog multimeters, the <b>meter</b> <b>deflection</b> is inversely proportional to the resistance, so full-scale will be 0ohms, and higher resistance will correspond to smaller deflections. [...] The ohms scale is compressed, so resolution is better at lower resistance values.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, the {{tendency}} in some {{sectors of the}} fishing industry has been to use thicker and stiffer twines {{in the manufacture of}} netting material. This increases the mesh’s resistance to opening and, consequently, reduces the selective performance of fishing gears. The main characteristic of netting twine contributing to mesh resistance to opening is flexural rigidity (EI). We present a methodology for quantifying mesh resistance to opening {{through the use of a}} prototype called the resistance to opening and <b>deflection</b> <b>meter</b> (ROD-m). It incorporates four tension load cells and four stepping motors that are driven by four ministep bipolar chopper drives. Small panels of netting (3 3 meshes) can be mounted on ROD-m, which can measure the forces acting on the netting and the position of the knots. Estimates of the flexural rigidity of the netting twine can be made from these data. We present the results of the analysis of Mediterranean polyamide netting, and standard and Brezline polyethylene (PE) netting from the North Sea. In all netting, regardless of the material used, EI increases with increasing linear density. Furthermore, Brezline is much stiffer than standard green PE, although they are equally thick...|$|E

(Civil Engineering) The: {{structural}} {{classification of}} granular base pavements {{by means of}} resilient deflection bowl parameters measured by the Impulse <b>Deflection</b> <b>Meter</b> and application of measured deflections at network level were investigated. The Investigation consisted of a mechanistic analysis and an analysis of observed field results. Curves for structural classification of granular base pavements obtained by regression are presented. The Curves obtained by the analysis of field observations compare well with local experience and theoretical failure criteria. It {{was found that the}} mechanistic model used in this study did not yield satisfactory results when simulating deflection behaviour through linear elastic programs. The parameters recommended for future use are Maximum Deflection (Y-rnax), Base Layer Index, or DLl (formerly SCI), Middle Layer Index, or MLl (formerly DOl) and Radius of Curvature. The use of deflection measurements at network level was also investigated. A method for calculating a Structural Stiffness Index to be incorporated into Pavement Management Systems as a Structural Indicator is proposed. Recommendations regarding the density of testing and identification of roads for testing at network level are also made. Several factors influencing deflections and structural bearing capacity are discussed and some recommendation. " are made. The main factors influencing deflections and predicted pavement structural capacity were shown to be Temperature, Seasonal Influences and Condition of Surfacing. Further research into the specific influence of these factors on deflections and hearing capacity is needed...|$|E

50|$|The D'Arsonval {{galvanometer}} is {{a moving}} coil ammeter. It uses magnetic deflection, where current {{passing through a}} coil placed in the magnetic field of a permanent magnet causes the coil to move. The modern form of this instrument was developed by Edward Weston, and uses two spiral springs to provide the restoring force. The uniform air gap between the iron core and the permanent magnet poles make the <b>deflection</b> of the <b>meter</b> linearly proportional to current. These meters have linear scales. Basic meter movements can have full-scale deflection for currents from about 25 microamperes to 10 milliamperes.|$|R

50|$|If {{the meter}} {{on any of}} the ion chamber devices are {{observed}} to respond at all to a radiation source, evacuation of the area should be considered. No legally exempt source of gamma radiation would be expected to cause any visible <b>deflection</b> of the <b>meter</b> on its most sensitive setting, so it might be assumed that such a radiation field could be dangerous. Such a meter would not be expected to detect the presence of radiation except the very high levels that might be found {{in the event of a}} nuclear weapon detonation or a major release of radioactive material as from a nuclear reactor meltdown. The CD V ion chamber units are now all approaching 50 years old at a minimum and that they contain parts that are sensitive to moisture, so relatively frequent calibration and inspection by an accredited and properly equipped facility is required to ensure reliable and accurate function.|$|R
40|$|This {{instrument}} {{is designed for}} the detection and measurement {{of a group of}} ionizing radiations. Interchangeable ionization chambers have been constructed for the measurement of (1) beta and gamma radiations, (2) surface and hand monitoring of alpha radiations, (3) alpha and beta radiation of dust samples collected in precipitron tubes, and (4) fast neutrons. Moderate to high radiation intensities are measured by direct continuous deflection of a microammeter indicating changes in plate current of a 1 LN 5 tube used as an electrometer tube. Low intensities of radiation are measured by allowing the charge due to the ionization current to collect on one plate of a condenser. The other plate connects to the grid of the electrometer tube and to ground through a high resistance. During the period of charge collection the two condenser plates are electrically shielded from one another by a grounded metal vane inserted between them. On removing this vane the charge on the first plate of the condenser is communicated to the second plate and thus to the tube grid. A transient <b>meter</b> <b>deflection</b> then occurs proportional to the product of ionization current and ion collection time. A two pole, triple throw switch allows the output meter to be connected in test 1 position to measure screen grid current, in test 2 position to set tube voltages to reproducible values, and in "Operate" position to measure changes in plate current.

40|$|In this project, an {{exposure}} meter which is sensitive to, and calibrated for infrared radiation {{was designed and}} constructed. An EG 2 ̆ 6 G SGD- 100 A silicon photodiode was chosen to use as the photodetector. This choice was based on cost, availability, ruggedness, stability, and sensitivity. A circuit using an operational amplifier to amplify {{the output of the}} photodetector was used. The circuit design allowed easy variation of the signal gain to give a detectable <b>meter</b> <b>deflection</b> under varying lighting conditions. Five different gains were used to allow use of the meter under conditions ranging from outside under direct sunlight, to inside with typical room lighting. The gains used were empirically established. The film used was Kodak HIE 135 - 20. This is a black-and-white panchromatic emulsion with special sensitizing agents added to extend the film 2 ̆ 7 s sensitivity into the near infrared to about 900 nanometers. The spectral response of the photodetector was to be filtered to match the spectral response of this infrared sensitized film. This proved not to be possible, due to the unavailability of any regular, stock filter which cuts off wavelengths above 900 nanometers. Despite this problem, the meter is much more accurate for setting exposures for the infrared sensitized film used than a normal {{exposure meter}}. The designed meter typically indicates within one stop of the optimum exposure for this film. A normal exposure meter reading made using Kodak 2 ̆ 7 s exposure recommendations was incorrect by as much as three stops...|$|R
