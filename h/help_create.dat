Kenny {{previously}} worked with Hillenburg on Rocko's Modern Life, and when Hillenburg created SpongeBob SquarePants, he approached Kenny to voice the character. Hillenburg utilised Kenny's and other people's personalities to <b>help</b> <b>create</b> {{the personality of}} SpongeBob.|$|E
5|$|After the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup, John Herdman {{was hired}} as {{head coach of the}} Canadian {{national}} team. He rebuilt the team and used inclusive language to <b>help</b> <b>create</b> an environment that allowed players to be honest with each other and grow. McLeod was able to address issues that she had with herself and others, which she attributed to helping re-build her confidence.|$|E
5|$|Banking also {{developed}} in this period. The Bank of Scotland was suspected of Jacobite sympathies {{and so a}} rival Royal Bank of Scotland was founded in 1727. Local banks began to be established in burghs like Glasgow and Ayr. These would make capital available for business and the improvement of roads and trade, which would <b>help</b> <b>create</b> the conditions for the Industrial Revolution that accelerated {{in the second half}} of the century.|$|E
50|$|In 1990 he <b>helped</b> <b>create</b> First Warning, a state map which {{appeared}} {{in the corner of the}} television screen, with counties colored in to indicate storm watches and warnings. In 1991 England also <b>helped</b> <b>create</b> Storm Tracker, a computer program that provided the audience with the time of arrival of severe weather. First Warning And Storm Tracker are used nationwide. He also <b>helped</b> <b>create</b> I-News, a computer program, since discontinued, that allowed PC users to receive both severe weather and breaking news alerts on their computer.|$|R

5|$|In 2011 Ne-Yo was {{approached}} by Cartoon Network to <b>help</b> <b>create</b> an animated series. Ne-Yo announced that the show would be titled I Heart Tuesday {{and that he had}} created it for his sister. He also stated that he wanted to avoid having the show resemble the anime art style of The Boondocks due to the potential cost of the show's animation style.|$|E
5|$|Where sawgrass grows densely, few {{animals or}} other plants thrive, {{although}} alligators often choose these locations for nesting. Where {{there is more}} room, periphyton grows, appearing as mats or brown sausage-shaped chunks. Periphyton is predominantly algae, although over 100different microorganisms <b>help</b> <b>create</b> it. Larval insects and amphibians are supported by periphyton; these in turn provide food for birds, fish, and reptiles. Periphyton also absorbs calcium from the water, which creates marl where sawgrass takes root.|$|E
5|$|Wind shear is an {{important}} aspect of a squall line. In low to medium shear environments, mature thunderstorms will contribute modest amounts of downdrafts, enough to <b>help</b> <b>create</b> a leading edge lifting mechanism – the gust front. In high shear environments created by opposing low level jet winds and synoptic winds, updrafts and consequential downdrafts can be much more intense (common in supercell mesocyclones). The cold air outflow leaves the trailing area of the squall line to the mid-level jet, which aids in downdraft processes.|$|E

5|$|After leaving WWE, Moretti began wrestling {{sporadically}} on {{the independent}} circuit under her birth name. On November 19, 2005 in Spartanburg, South Carolina at A Tribute to Starrcade, she teamed with Bambi to defeat Team Blondage (Krissy Vaine and Amber O'Neal) for the CCW Tag Team Championship. On April 21, 2006 in Surrey, British Columbia, Moretti defeated Rebecca Knox for Extreme Canadian Championship Wrestling (ECCW)'s NWA SuperGirls Championship. She also successfully retained her title in a match the following night. Afterward, Moretti {{decided to stay}} with ECCW to <b>help</b> <b>create</b> a strong women's division. She held the title for approximately five months before losing it to Nattie Neidhart on October 8, 2006.|$|E
5|$|Blood-C was {{designed}} to share only thematic similarities with earlier Blood projects. CLAMP was brought on board to both design the characters and <b>help</b> <b>create</b> the scenario. It featured several new elements to the Blood franchise, such as being primarily set within a high school environment. The Elder Bairns were inspired by the Great Old Ones from H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, and modeled after traditional Japanese monsters. Its bloody violence, a stylistic choice following the series' themes, resulted in censorship in Japan and eventual blacklisting in China. The series has received mixed to positive reviews from journalists.|$|E
5|$|Once he {{returned}} to Nigeria, Achebe was promoted at the NBS {{to the position of}} Director of External Broadcasting. One of his first duties was to <b>help</b> <b>create</b> the Voice of Nigeria network. The station broadcast its first transmission on New Year's Day 1962, and worked to maintain an objective perspective during the turbulent era immediately following independence. This objectivity was put to the test when Nigerian Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa {{declared a state of emergency}} in the Western Region, responding to a series of conflicts between officials of varying parties. Achebe became saddened by the evidence of corruption and silencing of political opposition.|$|E

5|$|The Bay Area is {{presently}} {{home to a}} thriving computer animation industry led by Pixar Animation Studios and Industrial Light & Magic. Pixar, based in Emeryville, produced the first fully computer animated feature film, Toy Story, with software it designed in-house and whose computer animation films have since garnered 26 Academy Awardss and critical acclaim. Industrial Light & Magic, {{which is based in}} the Presidio in San Francisco, was created in 1975 to <b>help</b> <b>create</b> visual effects for the Star Wars series has since been involved with creating visual effects for over three hundred Hollywood films.|$|E
5|$|With the {{feedback}} received from players {{after the release}} of Nightmare, Brett Clements and Phillip Tanner started work on the major update to the series. They struck a deal with J. W. Spear & Sons, to use publishing experience and market research with Nightmare to <b>help</b> <b>create</b> the new game. The deal allowed J. W. Spear & Sons to have input into how the game was developed, which was not the case with Nightmare. Village Roadshow was also involved with the game's development and with its release in the United States. The development ended six years after it started, with about six million dollars invested {{in the development of the}} game.|$|E
5|$|Americium-241 {{has been}} used as a {{portable}} source of both gamma rays and alpha particles for a number of medical and industrial uses. The 59.5409keV gamma ray emissions from 241Am in such sources can be used for indirect analysis of materials in radiography and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, as well as for quality control in fixed nuclear density gauges and nuclear densometers. For example, the element has been employed to gauge glass thickness to <b>help</b> <b>create</b> flat glass. Americium-241 is also suitable for calibration of gamma-ray spectrometers in the low-energy range, since its spectrum consists of nearly a single peak and negligible Compton continuum (at least three orders of magnitude lower intensity). Americium-241 gamma rays were also used to provide passive diagnosis of thyroid function. This medical application is however obsolete.|$|E

5|$|Brought by JC's {{agents to}} Liberty Island, Alex learns that the island holds an old {{part of the}} pre-Collapse {{worldwide}} communication network {{which can be used}} by each faction. No matter what choices Alex has made up to now, they can choose to side with any faction, or kill all the leaders on Liberty Island. If Alex follows JC's plan, the biomods are distributed worldwide, giving Helios the ability to access all human thought, allowing it to govern humanity. If Alex sides with the Illuminati, they use the network to <b>help</b> <b>create</b> a global surveillance state where communication and the economy are controlled. If Alex joins the Templars, they help unite humanity under a theocracy where biomod use and those considered impure are ruthlessly suppressed. Killing all other factions on Liberty Island leads to global chaos, turning Earth into a wasteland dominated by the Omar.|$|E
5|$|From 2006 to 2013, XV was {{developed}} by what was then Square Enix 1st Production Department. In the wake of extensive business restructuring in 2013, development of XV transferred to the newly formed Business Division 2, headed by Tabata and incorporating the core Final Fantasy development team. Along with bringing in staff members from other sections of the company, they also recruited help from other development studios: HexaDrive {{was brought in to}} help with engineering the game, XPEC Entertainment helped with the design for the later sections of the game, Shanghai company Plusmile helped with the design of buildings, licensed middleware from Umbra was used to boost the game's graphics, while Streamline Studios was brought in to help with technical development. It was initially supposed, after an announcement in 2015, that Avalanche Studios was brought on board to <b>help</b> <b>create</b> the game's airship mechanics. In the event, Avalanche and Square Enix did not directly collaborate: instead, Avalanche showed them their level of detail development methods, and Square Enix's internal team created the airship mechanics using that information.|$|E
5|$|IGN's Chloi Rad commended the game's {{blend of}} drama and action, {{as well as}} the {{realistic}} depiction of violence, and felt that the game's setting and period helped demonstrate the spirit of the revolution. Andrew Todd of Gameplanet praised the game's manner of dealing with issues like inequality, theocracy, and causes of anti-Americanism, and noted that they <b>help</b> <b>create</b> the atmosphere of the story and setting. Eurogamer's Jeffrey Matulef found the narrative's moral ambiguity refreshing, particularly the depiction of corrupting good people. He felt that the development team being primarily Iranian added to the game's authenticity. Kotakus Evan Narcisse similarly appreciated the ambiguity, noting its close imitation to the era. The choices presented in the game split reviewers; some found them important and scary, while others found them ultimately inconsequential.|$|E

5|$|Maeser's primary {{responsibility}} was {{to head the}} Utah exhibit at the Mid-winter Fair in San Francisco in 1894, while he was serving as Superintendent of Church Schools. The exposition was patterned after Chicago World's Fair of 1893. At the Chicago exhibit, the church had displayed minerals and produce from Utah. In the San Francisco exhibit, Maeser chose {{to focus more on}} beliefs of the church and educational accomplishments of students in the church school systems. The church had an exhibit in the Manufacturers and Liberal Arts Building, and Maeser gave a series of lectures to bring more publicity to the church school exhibit. Utah's participation in the exhibit attempted to gain favor for its becoming a state. He and his companions helped distribute information about the history of Utah. No one was baptized into the church while Maeser was president of the mission; however, he did <b>help</b> <b>create</b> friendlier public-relations between Utah and California.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill had}} a more {{difficult}} time in the Senate. The National Association of Manufacturers, Chamber of Commerce, and industrialist Henry Ford all opposed its passage. Senator Bennett Champ Clark introduced an amendment to emasculate Section 7(a), but Wagner and Senator George W. Norris led the successful opposition to the change. The bulk of the Senate debate, however, turned on the bill's suspension of antitrust law. Senators William E. Borah, Burton K. Wheeler, and Hugo Black opposed any relaxation of the Sherman Antitrust Act, arguing that this would exacerbate existing severe economic inequality and concentrate wealth {{in the hands of}} the rich (a severe problem which many economists at the time believed was one of the causes of the Great Depression). Wagner defended the bill, arguing that the bill's promotion of codes of fair trade practices would <b>help</b> <b>create</b> progressive standards for wages, hours, and working conditions, and eliminate sweatshops and child labor. The Senate passed the amended legislation 57-to-24 on June 9.|$|E
