25|$|Spoon is {{used for}} bap (rice) and soupy dishes, while most other banchan (side dishes) are eaten with chopsticks. Eating rice with chopstick is {{accepted}} but traditionally considered to be practice of low class and may be frowned upon.

Spoon or chopsticks shouldn't be stuck into the rice bowl.|$|E
500|$|I went to New York to meet (Madonna), begrudgingly, {{and showed}} up at an address at SoHo, {{which turned out to}} be a squat basically. Madonna was scantily clad, working out to a massive disco track. She was charismatic. She kept putting her head <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and talking to me, very flirtatious, and that gave me the idea for the scene in [...] "burning up", where her face is on the road, and the camera's really low and close.|$|E

500|$|The {{band members}} {{began to have}} doubts about the record's sound. [...] During this time, Cobain admitted, [...] "The first time I played it at home, I knew there was {{something}} wrong. [...] The whole first week I wasn't really interested in listening to it at all, and that usually doesn't happen. [...] I got no emotion from it, I was just numb." [...] The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and approached Albini to remix the album. [...] The producer declined; as he recalled, [...] " [...] wanted to make a record that he could slam <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and say, 'Listen, I know this is good, and I know your concerns about it are meaningless, so go with it.' [...] And I don't think he felt he had that yet... My problem was that I feared a slippery slope." [...] The band attempted to fix its concerns with the record during the mastering process with Bob Ludwig at his studio in Portland, Maine. [...] Novoselic was pleased with the results, but Cobain still did not feel the sound was perfect.|$|E

2500|$|P. G. Wodehouse {{refers to}} Ade's [...] "The Fable of the Author Who Was Sorry for What He Did to Willie" [...] in Love Among the Chickens (1909) ("The whole thing began like Mr. George Ade's fable of the author. An author — myself — {{was sitting at}} his desk trying to turn out {{something}} that could be converted into breakfast food, when a friend came in and sat <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and told him to go right on and not mind him." [...] (Chapter XII) and [...] "I felt, like the man in the fable, as if some one had played a mean trick on me, and substituted for my brain a side order of cauliflower." [...] (Chapter XVI)) He uses the same sentence again in Mike (1909) (But that Adair should inform him, two minutes after Mr. Downing’s announcement of Psmith’s confession, that Psmith, too, was guiltless, and that the real criminal was Dunster — it was this that made him feel that somebody, in the words of an American author, had played a mean trick on him, and substituted for his brain a side-order of cauliflower.

2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Live Your Life" [...] was filmed in October 2008 in Los Angeles and was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler. The video, using the radio edit of the song, stars T.I. and Rihanna. It plays backwards, starting {{with the end of}} T.I.'s day. In the opening scene T.I. is shown walking with bloody wounds culminating in the song beginning. It then goes from a series of underground shots of him with interspersed scenes of Rihanna in a dressing room. T.I. is then shown being thrown out of a car, being kicked by a large man. The video then cuts again to the day with T.I. wearing the same suit seen earlier in the video, but undamaged. He then encounters a group of thugs whom he brawls with. The video then begins a different story arc, showing T.I. before he made his fortune, singing in a recording studio and in front of a house playing dice and dominoes with friends. This portion of the video is interspersed with clips of the other story arc, such as showing T.I. with a briefcase full of money. He is then shown in the bathroom of a bar, before walking out into the bar passing Rihanna who has exited her dressing room. Rihanna performs on stage with a microphone while T.I. talks to a man saying [...] " [...] want out."; the man replies by explaining that there is no getting out, not for him nor for the character that Rihanna plays. T.I slams the money briefcase <b>down</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and shows it to the man saying that [...] "I'm done. I got myself here, I'll get myself out". Then he is seen walking into that same bar, in a flashback, with a CD in his hand. The man that T.I. spoke to earlier calls him over. This is a flashback showing T.I. trying to get a record deal. The last shot of the video takes place at around {{the same time as the}} first shot of the video. T.I. is walking down the Los Angeles River, raising his hands triumphantly in the air with a bloodied and scarred face. The song's producer, Just Blaze, is briefly seen playing pool in the bar during the second verse and final chorus.|$|E
