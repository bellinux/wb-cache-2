25|$|Henry Kaiser became {{fascinated with}} the {{healthcare}} system created for him by Garfield and began to directly manage Kaiser Permanente and Garfield. This resulted in a financial disaster when Kaiser splurged on the new Walnut Creek hospital; his constant <b>intermeddling</b> led to significant friction {{at every level of}} the organization. The situation was not helped by Kaiser's marriage to Garfield's head administrative nurse (who had helped care for Kaiser's first wife on her deathbed), convincing Garfield to marry the sister of that nurse, and then having Garfield move in next door to him. Clifford Keene (who would eventually serve as president of Kaiser Permanente) later recalled that this arrangement resulted in a rather dysfunctional and combative family in charge of Kaiser Permanente.|$|E

These included paying court to a young nun whom she almost persuaded to elope with her. In 1740, her husband placed an advertisement in the Newcastle Journal announcing that she had left him and asking for her to return. Jane Gomeldon undertook an unusual response by placing her own advertisement in the rival Newcastle Courant, explaining that she had left {{him because of his}} cruelty to her and because he was <b>intermeddling</b> with the fortune that her mother had left her, secured for her sole and separate use. In 1742, she brought a separation suit to court, against her husband, on the grounds of cruelty.|$|E

2500|$|In {{clarifying}} {{the meaning of}} intent {{in the context of}} a trespass to chattels claim of Torts states that [...] "intention is present when an act is done for the purpose of using or otherwise <b>intermeddling</b> with a chattel or with knowledge that such an <b>intermeddling</b> will, to a substantial certainty, result from the act," [...] and that, furthermore, [...] "t is not necessary that the actor should know or have reason to know that such <b>intermeddling</b> is a violation of the possessory rights of another." ...|$|E
2500|$|In sum, {{the basic}} {{elements}} of a claim of trespass to chattels are: 1) the lack of the plaintiff's consent to the trespass, 2) interference or <b>intermeddling</b> with possessory interest, and 3) the intentionality of the defendant's actions. [...] Actual damage is not necessarily a required element of a trespass to chattels claim.|$|E

2500|$|The Restatement (Second) of Torts § 217 defines {{trespass}} to chattels as [...] "intentionally… dispossessing {{another of}} the chattel, or using or <b>intermeddling</b> with a chattel {{in the possession of}} another." [...] Harm to personal property or diminution of its quality, condition or value {{as a result of a}} defendant's use can also result in liability under § 218(b) of the Restatement.|$|E
2500|$|The use of or <b>intermeddling</b> (a term usually {{applicable}} to estate law) with {{the property of}} another has often been held to constitute a conversion, whether the act is done by one who had no authority to use the property, or by one who has authority to use the property but uses it in an unauthorized way. [...] Any unjustified exercise of dominion over property by one who is not the owner nor entitled to possession which interferes with the right of possession of another who is lawfully entitled thereto constitutes a conversion. [...] According to the Restatement (Second) of Torts, one who uses a chattel in a manner which is a serious violation {{of the right of}} another to control its use is subject to liability to the other for conversion. [...] A conversion may be predicated upon destruction of personal property. [...] An action for conversion may lie for killing an animal or rendering a musical instrument useless.|$|E

60|$|It was {{the first}} time that foreign powers, interfering in the {{concerns}} of a nation divided into parties, have thought proper to thrust wholly out of their councils, to postpone, to discountenance, to reject, and, in a manner, to disgrace, the party whom those powers came to support. The single person of a king cannot be a party. Woe to the king who is himself his party! The royal party, with the king or his representatives at its head, is the royal cause. Foreign powers have hitherto chosen to give to such wars as this the appearance of a civil contest, and not that of an hostile invasion. When the Spaniards, in the sixteenth century, sent aids to the chiefs of the League, they appeared as allies to that league, and to the imprisoned king (the Cardinal de Bourbon) which that league had set up. When the Germans came to the aid of the Protestant princes, in the same series of civil wars, they came as allies. When the English came to the aid of Henry the Fourth, they appeared as allies to that prince. So did the French always, when they <b>intermeddled</b> in the affairs of Germany: they came to aid a party there. When the English and Dutch <b>intermeddled</b> in the succession of Spain, they appeared as allies to the Emperor, Charles the Sixth. In short, the policy has been as uniform as its principles were obvious to an ordinary eye.|$|R
